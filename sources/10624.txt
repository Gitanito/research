  		              		Experience Description   ,

    We have a punch bag at home and I occasionally practiced punching it for fun. Usually my practices last 20 to 30 minutes. One afternoon during the month of Ramadan, I went to our yard. I practiced punching the bag for 30 minutes while I was fasting. Boxing practice drops the blood pressure, but my fasting had intensified thed drop in blood pressure.  I was feeling  weak after the practice. When I finished, I went back inside and sat next to my older brother who was lying down on the sofa. I leaned on his legs and we started chit-chatting. I was breathing heavily and could only respond to him slowly, while I had dropped my head down and forward. My brother asked me, 'Why do you look like the Hunchback of Notre Dame?' As he said that, he pulled my head back in a way that my neck got positioned against his knee. I tried to tell him not to do that because I am not feeling well, but I passed out.

   Suddenly, all the feeling of pain in my muscles and my shortness of breath were gone. It was a good feeling and I was in peace. The next thing I saw was all my life events playing out in front of my eyes. I don’t remember if these events were good or bad, but I had a good feeling overall. Everything was passing so fast, but I  could see and understand them without a problem. I did not remember anything about the room my body was in, the condition of  my body,  or my brother.  I felt I was getting away from Earth while watching my life events. 

After some time, I saw the room again. My brother had let go of my head when he noticed my weakness. This was my deepest NDE. I had a few other experiences as a result of shortage of blood supply to my head.  But this experience is unique and I had the best feeling. I wanted the experience to repeat, but it never happened again.

What is your religion now?         Muslim   Shia  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     It was proven to me that our deeds are recorded and will be shown back to us on judgment day, and also being questioned for them. But I believe in God’s mercy above all.  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I can feel and understand God better and believe in his forgiveness and mercy much more than before.

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Uncertain     

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Uncertain       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.     Yes     I knew my life is being shown to me for a purpose. When passing through the bad things I had done, I was not feeling good, but everything passed so fast.

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It is definitely hard to describe these experiences. Back then, I was not in a good physical or mental state. I could not even keep my head up straight and I was feeling a deep sadness and was hurt from certain things. When I entered this experience, I totally forgot about my body, like it never existed. I also lost all the stresses in my mind and sadness in my soul.  I was feeling light and wonderful.  
  
How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience less accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  We will leave Earth and leave our body behind. Our deeds are recorded. We will be punished for our bad deeds and will be loved and encouraged for our good deeds.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely  real.      I don’t have any way to prove it, but know it in my heart.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely  real.      I study about near death experiences.  
  
  At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   Because I have low blood count, this happened to me a few times. But it was never this deep.  I can tell another experience that was a bit deep too. I was sitting in a room and studying for an exam. When I finished a page I was reading, I got up to turn off the light and left the room. After a while, I saw myself that had  fallen on the ground and in the corner of the room.  I was turning my face left and right on the ground and whispering some of the material I studied. I got up and saw that my nose skin has gone and there is a rather large but shallow redness on my skin as a result of rubbing against the floor. I realized my brain was executing the same program from a few minutes ago that I was turning my head left and right to follow the lines. This actually felt like just passing out, not a near death experience.
