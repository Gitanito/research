She was using a kitchen towel filled with ice. I remember lying there on the sofa in a pool of sweat, scared, in pain and ringing in my ears; looking up at my mother and seeing the fear in her face. She was frantically trying to lower my body temperature. 

Then, there was silence. The ringing stopped, the pain was gone and I, from a higher elevation, was watching my mother kneeling beside the sofa, shaking me. This lasted for what seemed a matter of seconds and the noises and pains returned.
