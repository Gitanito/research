THE
LOST 1 R I B E S
OF ISRAEL
By
Doreal
Perhaps, one . of th e st :can ges t dis-
appear ances in all history is th at which
took place wnen the t welve tribes of an-
ci ent Israel w-
ere divided or separated
in the year 9'75 B.C. According to Bib-
lical tradition, some 18.61 years B.C., ·
the story began~ That is, in that ye ar
Jacob was born and Jacob had twelve sons.
Before continuing . from -that point,
there are ju s t a few r emarks thot I want
to make conc ernin g that. The.t was a long
time ago, 1861 years B. C. You will re-
member Jacob ,as 9e in g th B ono v/ho had so
many spiritual adv entures. He was the
one who wr e stl ed wi th the angel. He was
the one who slept on the plain with his
head upon a stone and saw th e vision of
the ladder rising into he aven and the
ang~ls ascending and descend i ng.
I am not going to speak from the
occult -standpoint. If we dld I might
draw certain conclusion~ from the fact
that Jacob saw the ladder asce nding i.nto
heaven and that he ·had twelve sons. Sym-
bolically speaking, Jacob stood for the
Third Eye or Eye Single in man, the place
from which man coptacts Div in ity ~r God
and I mi ght d,raw the C<mcl u~ j_on th r;
.t the
-3-
twelve sons of Jacob might be symbolic
of the twelve great spiritual centers
in man through which the t welve divine
laws enter into man. I might even draw
the Bame conclusion that some of our
Eastern teachers have that the twelve
sons of Jacob · stood for the twelv e houses
of the zodiac, that came forth from our
Father, the Sun, but we ar0 concerned
more With tho materiA-1 aspect of the
mystery of the Twelve Trlbes of Israel,
- especially the ten Tri .bes.
We are told that the twelve sons 6f
Jacob formed the twelve tribes or fam-
ilies that became known as the Twelve
Tr•ib-es or Tw0lvc Houses of Israel. In
the Old Hebrew Scriptures I have found
.the same peculiar ·word used that is used
in Job in reference to the .Twelve Houses.
They say twelve -"IVIazzoth". It has been
translated in Job as houses and also in
the references to Jacob as hom:rn. As a
matter of fact, the best Hebrew commen-
tators say it means zodiac.
It is very hard to examine any of
the ancient religious works wit.h.out find-
ing occult symbolism in them. Many of
the stories in the Old Testament are used
to illustrate certain Kabb alistic prin- ~
ciplo s or laws. Those twe J.ve sons formed
the twelve tribes or Nations and they
continued as one confederation until the
t:i.me that the son of Solomon 1:•uled in
Israel. In that period, in the first
year of his reign, in 975 B.C., they had
a lot of trouble and this king was like
some of our modern men. He tried to be-
-4-
come a dictator and as a result the ten
Tribes seceded from the Israelite con--
federation and set up a separ a t0 nation,
called Israelites~ Only the house of
Judah and . house of Benjamin, so named
after two of the sons of Jacob, remained ..
W
e know that the Ju,d ai t .e s we.re the only
true Semit i c peQ-ples in tno entire
Israelite confe ,der a t;i_
on, ... that is,
that aL!. je ws b.B
long · ·to the house of
Judah. Tl:'l.eBenjamEmi tei;; wer e not Jews
but they remained with the tribe of
Judah and in the cours e of thousands
of years were assimil 1;1.
ted until tp.ey be-
came pr a ctic a lly on.0 r ~~
c0 • .
I mi ght . quote this: that it is said
that the Lor d made a mark upon the face
of -the childr 0n of Jud!:!.h so o.11men might
know them, The refore, we fi nd distinc-
tive racial cha racteristics of th e Jew-
ish race being -proset>ved to this da y ,
One of the great ®st mistak e s that
our modern churches makes ls confusing
the Jews and Israelites. Tho ancient
comment ators, in Mohammedan countries
know a lot about our Old Testament char-
act ers th at we do not have in our English
Bible, many stories about Abra ha~,Jaoob,
Solomon and o_
thers ... th oy say th~t the
term 'sons of Jacob .•. was not correct i.n
the physical sense, but rather that the
sons of Jacob so-called wer e actually
twelve different races brou ght together
in a confederation undef Jacob ·, - and
therefore, he was, the f ather of nations
and they became his sons. We find the
same terminolo gy u?.ed. of t~n in nB-tions
even to this day. Fo~ instance, we con-
sider Canada and Aust~alia as children
of Britain. It is just as we know, al~
most definitely, from research, that the
Gods from ancient Greece and Rome were
actually rulers, or kings of ancient
Atlantis.
After this separation or division
we find that the ten tribes that were
separated, disappeared so far as hifftori-
cal record is concerned. Another point
that I want to bring out is this: coming
down as far B'S centuries are concern ed,
to the t~ ne of Jesus, - at the time of
Jesus the Israelites were still consider-
ed' a ·part of the ancient confederation
and do you not remember the \Mords of Je-
sus: "I am not sent. but to the Lost
Sheep · of the House of Israel ?11
In other
words, Jesus never really expected his
message to b.e received by the ·children
of- Judah., but he came fulfilling the
ancient prophecy th at sa.id that the Mes-
siah should be the line of the tribe of
Judah. When vie realize that Jesus was
rejected of the Je wi sh people, as he
still is today, and that his teaching
has spread throughout the entire world
among certain defini te nations and ra~es
of people, this becomes clear. In some
nations and some r aces very little foot-
hold has been gained and there is a def-
·inite reason for t his , because Jesus was
a Messiah for the Lost Trib~s of Israel.
I do not want you to think that I sub-
scribe to the British Israelite theory,
- I do note
-6-
We have to consider this, e.lso: that .
the chronology of the .Bible is obviously
erroneous. It places creation at less
than six thousand years ago. That is
very hard for U$ to believe when we are
able to read books of more than six
thousand years ago•· We know that some-
t .imes long dynasties of various kings
were included under one nnme and for that
reason we cannot place with ·e xactitude
any of the so-called dates in the Chris-
tian Bible, That includes of course, the
time of Solomon, of Jacoq or AbrD
ham or
any of the list of them. W
e -are actually
only guessing, if we accept the Biblical
account of chronology, - the flood took
place only _
a short time ago.
For instance, we find in Egyptian
records that some sixty years after the
deluge ·was supposed to ht1
ve · taken place
according to Bi bli .cal chronology, Egypt
engaged in a war in which there were more
than three and a half million men. That
is definite historical proof of the er-
ror in dates so far as the Bible is con-
cerned. I would place the so-called time
of the separation of the tribes at · ap-
proximat e ly 2,000 years B.C. I qo so be-
cause of my study of migration, of study
and movements .of iarious races of people
on earth,
The so-called Christian races of
the present time are descendants of the
Ten Lost Tribes, we · have oth er races in
the world · and we so~etimes wonder what
those qther races are in origin. First,
i~ is quite evident that at l eas t many,
-7-
not all, but many of the other races i n
the world aside from those descended
from the Ten Lost Tribes, definitely were
Ishmaelites, des (;r;ndants of Ishmael, and,,
perhaps, you kno w., or ramemb er, th at
Ishmael was the son of Abraham by a slave
woman, an.cl many of the wan6.er.1ng tribes
are considered n s being descG!l.dants of
Ishmael. Another thing: the lshmaelites
and the Ten Lost Tribes of Ju dah were
not all the 1'aces of manl~ind on earth.
We arrive at the problem of what we call
the Pre-Adamites- It has al way s been a
curious thing to rn.e to read in the Bible
that Cain waij the only man aside from
Adam on earth 1
;md then h<'i went into the
Land of Nod with his wife and built a
city. Where did · b,e get the \'fife and
_
where did ha get the men to build a city?
Now, another thin g : a ll of the
peoples · of Israel did not spe ak Hebrew.
You know, Hebrew of c;ourse is not spoken
by th e modern Je ws. They speak an ad-
mixture of Aramaic with many other
tongues. The so-call ed modern writin g
of the Jew ·s is not Hebrew and the spoken
language has very litt le relation to the
ancient Hebrew. Let me pu~ it in this
way: Hebrew , was an ancient, ·esotGric
language which was used in the sacred
an~ secret mysteries. All the so-called
· Hebrew writin gs were merely for .the pros-
ervation of the mysterieg which the
Israelites had, and in th e ir wande rings
and migrations th at lan gua ge was lost to
the Ten Tribes while the Tribe of Judah
and Benjamin preserved it to a gre at er
degree than any other, - though I mi ght
-8-
show you traces of it in · ancient German
and Hindustani.
We find thi s prophecy in Isaiah
concerning that thing, &nd it is men-
tioned in speal{ing of tho Messia.h: "With
another tongue will he speak to this
people", - not in tne ancient Sncr0d
language, and also in Isaiah, we find
this: "The Lo1·d shall call his servants
by a!}other name". Therefore, we can find
definite reasons why Is~ael is lost to
the world today. I might even put it
this way: that we know, for instance,
that England was settled in greut part
at least, from Germany. English people
are actually 0£ German descent~ That is,
certain races camQ fr•om ,fi
hat is now Ger.,.
many and settled in ~hat is now Britain,
driving out the Picts, a_ small, dark,
race of people, less than five f eet in
height.
Of interest to note in relationship
to that is this: th at the ancient Prim-
itive peoples coming from Germany did
not cal~ themselves Saxon$, but Isaac-
son qut the I was droppud and they latE"~r
called themselves Saxons. Do you know
that back in early historical periods of
the world, before the Romans invaded
Britain, it was called "Land'sEnd", and
it actually was the H.eaven ...
world or place
from which the spiritual rularship of
the world was directed, You find refer-
ence to that · in many of the ancient
works• - Now understand, I do not think
England is heaven today; thflt was a long
t.ime ago.
-9-
Another thing; after thB - death of
Solomon, the Israelites seceded from the
Israelitish confederation. W
e are told
in the Bible, according to chronology,
that they were ~istinctly different from
the House of Judah. The-y we3:•e Northern
tribes, · and were red-haired and fair-
skinned, ·whereas · the House of Judah and
Benjamin were dark-skinned, and dark-
haired and dark-eyed. The Northern tribes
were much f airer in complex:i.on - with
lighter eyes and h a 5.r. W
e are told this:
That there · were two distinct racial types
- that the House of Judah and Benjamin
belonged to what we today _ call ·t;he Brown
Race, who were, basically not of the -
Aryan or White Race, tmugb, a.fter tr ave ls
in many ,lands there have been inter•mix-
tures.
Now, let me give you a brief outline
before I talk about other aspects of it ·
as to dispersion of these tri bes which
you will note I said occurred much ear-
lier than Biblical chronology gives us.
I say about 2100 B.C. because my studies
give me every evidence to prove that to
be a fact. •
Did ·you know that there are people
in China~ not Chinese, who s till retain
some ancient Hebrew customs? In modern
China there are the remnants of n race
that have Jewish features; there has been
a considerable mixture with the Chinese,
but we find them there with fairly well.-
preserved memory of..::the ·ancient Hebrew
language. They do not speak it; :tt is a
dead language. Some can write some of
-10-
the ancient characters and they have many
of the customs and until about ~wenty-
five -y<
.,a.rs ago they had a Synagogue,
that however, has failen into ruin be-
cause they do not · retain en~ugh of the
old knowledge to continue t);letr ritual-
istic worship and they b,-~ve .& oonslder-
ably differ:et1t name f qJ? God than what is
used in our modern toflgue ·.
- .
It is un-qu.estionable that at least
one part, tf not all of the Tribes of
Israel earrying .
9ustQ.ms and tra9-itions
of ancient times s~ttled in N0rthern
China. We have ,er·v:~rw
poss:UJle physical
evidence of' th.at, even today, and their
traditions say they were led there by
the Great Prophet · whom they called Si-
meon. Sime .on was -one of' th.e twelve sons
of Jacob, so there we have at least evi-
dence of where at le -ast one of the Lost
T~ibes went and wbere they remain today.
There is one section there that ts
more or less forbidden territory, one
seotion wherB they do not let any white
man go. That is right on the edge of
the Gobi Desert. However, natives say
there is a small tribe of white men with
yellow hair and blue eyes who still live
there a~d do not mix with other races,
who live in the Gobi and as a result
there waa considE;}rable warfare . between
them and the Chinese. They said these
men were very fierce fighters.. ;rt · i./J.'.'11\Y

V
\Je _
know of coui'se, too, if we ac-
cept Mormon belief, that two of the other
lost Tribes · came to Americ a .. The y found
a primitive, red race that h ad migrated
here · much earlier. The North was not
always the icy, cold region it is to day
and Indian legend tells 11s that once they
lived f~r North in a wa·rm la .nd. There
are almost . as many varieties of Indians
as there are races of peoples. in the world
and some very very dark-:f ~inped, entirely
different,. while others wer•e very light-
skinned, and we certainly know th at even
down to historical times there were
tribes that had blue eyes, . fair skin and
light hair and of course, 80me say those
were an admixture of Nol'.:'Gemenwho came
to this country with Lief Ericson.
We have mfil
ny more stories of even
earlier discoveries and v;e know from very
good evidence that the Egyptians, Phoe-
nicians and Hindus and many others, at
one time had comme:r
•ce with this country,
and certainly the pyramid buildings of
Central America, South Am
erica and M
Bxi-
co is related to the Pyramids of Egypt,
In legend _
s we have evidence that Am
er:tca
had been settled, · civilized and popu.
lated and th e population di ssemin a ted, -
not once, btlt many times throug b a long
period of history.
There is a lake in Northern Cali-
fornia, and the Indians say that in the
-12-
middle of that lake was once an island,
and one m.ornin~ there came gr eat r)irds
flying in the air and shatt er ed temples
and islands, and caused it to sink. I
merely gave that as some evj d(mce of the
fact that there were once r aces here
other than what we call the true Ameri-
can Indian or red man.
Joseph Sm:i,
th, the founder of Mormon-
ism claims he found two tablets that had
written on them the works that we find
in the Book of Mormon. Acc~rding to leg-
' end, those two were buried by the Tribe
of Dan:1
.el and the tribe of Napthali.
From evidence which we find in races and
tribes here in America, most defj_ni te ly
there - was a certain . knowledge of the
Kabbala whieh was a common ,heritage of
all the Twelve Tribes of the Israelfte~.
The Cliff-Dwellers in New Mexico,
before - the white man came, were masons.
I do not mean they just built houses but
one man showed me a perfectly carved
ivory square and compass he had fo-und in
a cliff dwelling. The figure was carved
out of elephant 5vory. It has been sev-
eral thousand years since elephants roam-
'ed the prairies and plains here in Ameri-
ca, though they did once.
We also know that there was found a
leaden tablet in a cave in Indiana, that
was talked about bv scientists all over
the world and the lead tablet was carved
in Hebrew characters, that gave the first
chapter of the Book of Concealed Myster-
ies and the account of certain of the
wander:i.ngs of Daniel and the •r:ribe of
Napthali. It was discarded. Whatever
happened to it I do not know.
lt is just like in South America,
in 1871, when t~ey were mining for gold,
and broke into a cavern in the heart of
a hill. There were thirty-five workmen
in the group, and there was a Catholic
priest in the group and he sav,i it and
wrote about it. They f'ound in the mid-
dle of the cav0rn a ship etbout seventy
feet long, unlike nny ship which has
been known in hiH'to:ric .al times, becau;.1e
later, he examined eve!.'Y type of ves-
sel, and while they watehecl,it crumbl-
ed to dust before their eyes, after the
opening. It remain0d preserved beoause
ther ,e was not a brea. th of air to stir or
shake it.
I myself $8.W a piece of' metal
brought up from G-13.
oi 1 well, br•ought up .
in a bucket ~rom a qepth of 4500 feet,
a piece of white met~l of an alloy that
none of' the metallurgical chemists were ·
able to determine. Some said it must
have been a few feet underground; they
said it must have fallen down from there
when , you were casfng and knocked down,
but they had pushed the casing down when
they went down, and if it had been at
the bottom it would have been crushed.
However, there is much authenticated
evidenoe to prove the fact that at least
two of those tribes were here · in .Americ·a,
and that - from the admixture with some of
tbe races of Indians; for instance, the
Osages, Indians of Oklahoma, the govern-
ment put them on land in the northern
part of Oklahoma and thou ght they would
starve them to death and instead they
struck oil and became the richest race
in the world, per capita. Have you not
noticed that Indian raees were pushed
off on bare land and so many of them have
found material resources that have made
them wealthy? It does seem to be a fact
that wherever they have gone that people
of the Ten iribe~ have always been more
or less looked after. ·
In spite of the fact that the Jew-
ish race says that they a:t>e 'God's chosen
people', they do not tell us what they
were chosen for. They are the ones that
say it, and they a.r-
e the ones that have
preserved the records about it. As a
matter of fact, they are not 'God's
chosen people 1 • Ex·eepting they were
chosen :--
becau~e 9f cert s.i n pecu l iar abil-
ity they have to preserve ee1,tain sym-
1 bolical writings. That was because of a
peculiar power of mem
ory th at the Tribe
of Judah alone had. This enabled Ezra,
after the old Bible was destroyed, to
re-write it entirely from memory, Of
cource, that might be why some of the
mistakes crept in. The Mss. ~f the New
Testament are older th an the oldest of
the Old Testament. That is because when
one became worn - they made a new one ,
and destroyed the old one. There is no
fragment of Hebrew writing ·1n exist ence
older than the Eight Century B.C. That
is a stone with carving on it oomemorat.,.
in.g a victory of a tribe against an---enemy:..
-15-
·Another of the Lost r
1
1
:t'ibes defi-
nitely went to what we now cal l Ethiopia
or Abyssinia. You may, or may not know,
that Abyssinians, are not t hemselves of
the black race. Ther e are many Tribes
in what we now call Ethiopia and perhaps
you have noted the ruler is E·thiopian.
Certainly, the ruling family and H small
remnant of the high caste nobles of Eth-
iopia are dsscendants of one bf the lost
Tribes. They even have th e ir legends of
the Ark of the Covenant being brought to
Ethiopia. at one tlme. They hav9 a spec-
ial room far it but no one can - see .it.
They say that God, to pres erve it, made
it invisible, and the ancj_ent records of
the East sa ys def Jni t e ly that Ze bulon,
one of the lead~rs of the Lost Tribes
came to Ethiopia.
Th?,t was a short t1me after the time
of Solomon, and remember the Q
,neen of
.Sheba had a son by Solomon, and so the
rulers of Abyssinia were clo sely related
to the · Israelitish House, throu gh being
half of the House Qf Judah, a descendant
of Solomon and even today you perhaps
note the title of Baile Selassie as be-
ing the Lion of the Rous$ of Judah.
When the dispersion or secession
took place we are told th at one of the
Tribes of Israel moved into what we now
call Ethiopia. After a lon g period of
mi gration they settled there and forme d
a distinct r ·a-ee, · There had been a g:r~a t
admixture of races and still some of th e
characteristics of th at tribe remai n
among the people.
-16-
Another of the Lost Tribes disap-
peared into India, and I ha ppen to know
more about this particular th:Ln g than I
do any of the r•est of them because I
spent a considerable per i od of time in
this place. We are told th f
;:t th e Kash-
miris of the Kashmir Valley . ;tn Northern
India in the foothills of t he Himalayas
are almost i o their entirety, except for
a slight mixt ure with anoth er of the
Lost Tribes, of the House of Joseph. I
certainly cou ld find t hat t hey had pre-
ser ved a- ver;{ cons i~.er ab le .am
ount of the
ancient Kabbali stic tea-c hi ng3 , some of
the old customs and I even f ound in their
tongue a few of the anci en~ Hebrew words
still used, but you know th a t language
changes _
so much over . e short period of
time that someti mes races who are sep"
arated for a9 i;;hor•t a t :i.
me a s two hundred
years c-annot under s tand each other, be-
cause the languages had cba.n ged so much,
though originally they both had exact l y
the same langua ge.
Now, another of the Tri bes, or ra.th-
er, shall I say, two 9hher races, today
are descendants of ar1other of the anci ent
Tribes .. That is the Tribe of Gad, . thou gh
among the Afghans it is called Ghad.
That is, among the Afghans and the Tajiks
of Badakshan in northern India. W
e still
find that they have a very definite tr a~
diti9n of themselves as bein g once al-
lied to the ancient Jewish Ra ce. They
have a great many legends of Solomon
which I have nevev met with e lsewhere.
How many have heard ' the story of how the
great Temple of Jer us9.lem was built by
Solomon's cont r ol of t hose elemental
forces wh ich God gave him power over,
and 'how many kno w that when he did evil
in the si ght" of the Lord, how he was cast
from his t hr one and _for a per iod of ye ars
wandered in str ang e l ands and how dur i ng
that period of t i me an an ge l s at on his
throne?
Let us come down to one t h;;t mi ght
be of consider able inter e et to you. That
is, to the so-called Anglo-Saxon. W
e
know that RbtlUt the Ye ar 449 A.D., that
what 1
nas now England,. or the Briti sh
Islands was invaded by tr i be s from Ger-
many, that is by the Angl es Jut e s and
Saxons. We have a ~ast amount of evi-
denc e concerning the se and th e G8rmanic 1
rac e s of which they ar c the . line a l des-
cendants, one stay ed in Ger many and one
came to England, and with an admixture
of· Norman-Fr ,ench who also wer e Germanic
in origin the y form ed a di s tin ct braneh
of the Israelites. Tra di tion said th ey
were of the Trib e s of Levi and Asher and
, the Levites were the Priest Tribe of
ancient Isr ae l._ Gohen in Hebrew means
prie ·st,, It is said all pri ~ st s are Corens
but not all Cohens are p1•ie sts. However,
the real priestly line amon g th e J ewish
people, and kno wl edge of th e mea nin g of
the mysteries, came to. En gl and with th e
dispersion of the Isr aelite Trib e s, be-
cause one Tri be th at had th e int er pr e t a-
tion of it was the Levites who se ttled
in Europe. The Je ws were p.;
iven th e l e t-
ter and t he Levites were giv en the spir-
itu a l key and it was for th at reason
that J o3UE ~
.afue to t;r __s Is r,:i_e
l:i0
t 0s and
-lfr-
that through them his gospel has been
spread, because they inherited spiritual
realization while the Child of Judah had
the letter~ In tho end, when the wander-
ing tribes are brought together again,
the spirit and letter w~ll be conjoined
and the true knowledge of God regained,
the lost Key or lost path will be found.
When I say they were the Tribe of
Levi, I want you tc understand th ot tho
Tribe ~f Levi was a Tribe set apart, We
know that Solomon was of the Tribe of
Le'f"i and to put it frankly, when the time
Qf Solomon ended, the t:i,me ot' the wisdom
of the Israelites ended. The line of
great Priest-kings came to an end, and
with it departed th~ glory which wns
Israels. I am speaking now of the Tribes
of Judah and Benjamin.
What proof do we h,ave that the Le-
vites came to Europe~ . Well, how many of
you saw pictures of the coroFJ.ation of
the present King of England? Did you
notice · that there was n stone underneath
the throne. That wa-s the stone of Jo.cob
- that came through Ethiopia, through
Africa, to Europe. The Tribe of Zebulan
remained in Ethiopia, but tbe Levites
came to Europe and brought with them the
stone upon which Jacob had rested when
he saw the ladder raised into heaven and
every king of England today is crowaed
over Jacob's stone. It was considered
by the Kaiser that a son ' of David should.
always rule the earth, but the trouble
was that two descendants of David got
together and decided the - same thingt .

You will remember t hi s : That David
was red-haired, blue-ey ed and fair- skin-
ned. He was of the Tribe of Levi. He
was a priest-king, bec ause all of the
priest kings of Israel were of th at na-
ture and the Ark of the Covr::nant disap-
peared because the Levites~ who were
priests and guardians of it, br ought it
to Euro pe and the Ark of the Coven ant
res ts in a cave in Scotl and toda y . 'That
is the reason many have said that no
power can ever succe s sfully t ake and
hold England. Becaus e they say that the
power of the Ark prot e cts them and I
know this to -be a f act: th at Talbot
Mundy,. one of our gre a t writers of oc-
cult works ., wit h four oth er men formed a
company and offer ed the British govern-
ment 250,000 doll ars if t hey would let
him search for t hirty days for the Ark
of the Coverian t, and ke ep it if they
found it an d t hey turned him down. That
is one - of the state sacretsj because
they consider that as lon g as th ey have
it they will be able to ruie over the
world, because where the Ark goes, ther e
the _power goes.
Let us examine some of the other
Tribes: .- The Ary an-Roman r ace who ap-
peared in Europe, - some say about 1900
years B.C.and founded the cit y of Venice.
' In anci ent times they were called t he
Istrians. They were not called Romans
until later. Doesn't the term Istri an
have an association with another s on of
Jacob? Now we know that the anci ·en t
Rom
an language because of certain peeu-
liariti. e-s bears consi dera ble relation to ·
-20-
Sanskrit and have certain peculiartties
which would cause the name Issacher to
be changed to such form.
Another of the Lost Tr:i..bes is the
Armenians of the present time. They were
most closely related of all the tribes
to the Tribe of Jud.ah and were descen-
dants of the House of Reuben and it has
actually been said that the Armenian, in
many character_istics, :not facial or rac-
ial, are very mu.ch iike;l the people of
the children of Judah. It has been said
that the only one who can beat a .child
of Judah in a business deal or trade is
an Armenian becaus(;}- .. ·what the Child of
Judah had in certain _
aspects, th.e Armen-
ian had in super abundant · quality. We
are told t'.hat they were the one Tribe of
the Ten Lost Tribes that were not inclu.d-
ed in their entirety ln the tri pa.J.,dis-
persion.
The .Jews were Semites. They ' be lon g-
ed to the Brown Race. The Israelites
were basicaily 0f the White or Aryan
Race. The Hindus belong to _
the Aryan
Race, .not all Hindus, but those who be-
long to the Brahmifl: caste · are un gue s-
tionably of the Aryan. They are ' woat ~e
call the sun-burned races. That is be-
cause of climatic conditions, geography,
food; all t hose thin gs he .lp t o change
the color a tion,so they became much dark-
er than the other races who went tooth-
er parts of the world. ·we know that,
almost without exception, t he skin is
darker in warm countr:i,_e s and i n colder
countries it is lighter.
Let us examine the various races of
mankind -
,- very briefly to distinguish be-
tween Jew, Israelites and Gentile. The
Jews were Semites, the Israelites were
basically of the White Race. The Yellow,
Brown and Dra.vidian races weJ>e Gentiles.
Those races were a d,is.tinct · branch of
the human family. The Hindus were not
part of the Isr13.elite branch but part of
the ancient Aryan family, of which the
Ten Trit>es were a branch. They stem
back before the division ct the Tribes
which came originally from the same Root
Races. It wa.s the Pre-Ada111ite race that
the Ten Tribes of Israel came from,. be-
cause remember this, Only the Tribe of
Judah was tne Tribe of Adam, and it was
the Adamic ·Race that partook of the sin
of the fall of man. In the present ~ge
the Israelites were not part of that.
They were the race that belonged to the
Pre-Adamites-. '.Chat is the reason we
read this strange or curious statement
in the Christian Bible: 0
And the sons
of God looked -0n the daughters of men
that the7 were fair and took of them all
which they chose to wife and there were
born to them afterwards mighty men of
old, giants in their day". No.w, let us
say this: 'rha t the Children of Judah
were those ·that were of the Adamic or
man rac ·e while the Israeli tish race and
other races of the world were varj_ous
branches of the · Pre-Adamic, distinct and-
different.
The Story in the Bible that the
negroes are descendants ~f Ham whom God
cursed ls . riclicul-ous,. In thr.:ifir::-t place,
I do not think God would h ave upheJd Noah
because his son found mmdrunk and found
him wandering around naked in his t ent.
Second, it is ag a inst the laws of na- ·
ture. As a matter of f~ct, I think the
negro race originated in the beginning,
from a mixtur .e of two races. That is,
from the Pre-Adamic Raoe that was found
in the Land of N'od ·by C~in and his wife,
who was one of the P:r~-Ada,m
_
ic Races and
. the Great Blue Race O.f ancient Asia.
These later moved into Afr;ica and formed
the ancient black race. As a matter of
fact, the Sons or God ·an.d the Daughters
of men might be revers~q, in thc1it case.
The son of Adam, Cain, and the daughte:r
of a Pre-Adamic race.
In the Old Rebrew we have tirrn terms
that designated Ada-mites ar¥i Pre-Adamites.
The Adamites were Ha-Adam; the Pre-
Adamites were c~lled Ish-Adam. So we
find that th~re vms .a vast and gradual
dispersion of thcHie rac 8s over the earth
until they formed the basis of many of
the races of ea~th today.
