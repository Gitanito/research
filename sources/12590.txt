  		              		Experience Description   

    It was like a dream where I could not feel anything. I was floating near the ceiling of the hospital room and at first did not realize I was looking down on myself  in the bed. Then I recognized my wife and Brian  standing beside the bed  as this light, that was so bright that it was was blazing at me from behind. I turned around and went into the light. The light  was so bright that there is nothing on this earth that could match it. The sky and clouds were beautiful. I saw  green pastures on the other side. The tall grass was so green and swaying  from the nice breeze. There was a place like a  shared area, so I approached it. As I drew closer,  there was Jesus Christ! He  gave me a choice to go with him now or go back to be with my family and to  help them. As he was asking me for my answer, I saw a  vision of myself looking down at my wife and Brian. I was not ready to go yet, so I made the choice to go back. He let me know that I will be with him again. 

  I felt this so strongly there is no doubt and  made sure I will never forget it later  on down the road. I changed my whole life around. I have been sober after being a major alcoholic for almost 21 years. I don't do drugs either. I smoke cigarettes and I drink coffee, but that's my only crutch. I no longer have a need to be on Medicare or be numb. I have  powerful insight. I believe that God healed me in many areas of my life. I am also super sensitive. My pasture of our church told me. I have very powerful spiritual sight and  spiritual ears to hear with.

    Did you feel separated from your body?      Uncertain.  It was very confusing because my wife told me they had to throw all my clothes away because my body was rejecting the alcohol out of every area it could. I do not recall any of that at all.    
    
    Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         No

    Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No       

    Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     My senses are heightened to the point I can almost read minds. I can  can tell if people are  living othe truth or telling the truth. 
    
    Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          I am no longer afraid of anything, not even death. Now, death is something to look forward to. However, I'm in no hurry for it.
    
    Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    My girlfriend and her kids. 
    
    At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No       

    Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         There is a God and Jesus Christ lives. He is number one in my life.
    
    Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         You covered this very well.
