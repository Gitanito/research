INTRODUCTION
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Although there is no researcher consensus as to the definition of near   death experience (NDE), a relatively recent Dutch study by Dr. van Lommel,   defines NDE as the 'the reported memory of all impressions during a special   state of consciousness, including specific elements such as out-of-body   experience, pleasant feelings, and seeing a tunnel, a light, deceased relatives,   or a life review&quot; (van Lommel, 2001).&nbsp; Critical to this modern concept of NDE is   the awareness that the experience involves 'a special state of consciousness.'&nbsp;   The most common altered state of consciousness, experienced by both, near death   experiencers (NDErs) and non-NDErs, is dreams.&nbsp; Some NDErs questioning the   reality of their experience may wonder if their experience was a dream.&nbsp; Other   NDErs who share their experience with others often encounter those who dismiss   the NDE as 'just a dream.'&nbsp; Still other NDErs describe the NDE as more real than   waking reality.&nbsp; Alternative states of consciousness are best understood by   understanding how we process information and how we retrieve those memories.

Information memories   and recall:

  Recent findings have shown that humans   typically store information as a core memory attached to an emotion and then   filed in a concept area in the brain (Ornstein, 1991). &nbsp;When we retrieve our   memories, we are programmed to &quot;fill in the gaps.&quot; &nbsp;Even Freud noticed that   memories are stored by attaching emotion to them (p. 89). &nbsp;Emotions organize how   we store and access information in the brain. &nbsp;

  Recalled memory will be reconstructed using   the brain preference for order and stability. &nbsp;The memory will have a certain   order to it and will generally be re-told in a way that subjectively makes sense   to the individual. &nbsp;Analogous to a computer hard drive, we retrieve the memory   chunk of information, by accessing a particular emotional 'directory' in a   certain part of the brain. &nbsp;Then the memory chunk is connected to one or several   information chunks and the brain makes up the most logical story to connect the   separate information chunks. &nbsp;This means that the information is integrated into   an existing subjective framework of reality. &nbsp;

  One theory in consciousness studies   is that memories are not stored in the brain (Berkovich, 2001). &nbsp;Berkovich is in   the forefront of scientists who is exploring the theory that as an information   storage unit, the brain cannot possibly hold all the information that is   required to function in our society. Consequently, scientists are considering   the alternative that the brain is more of an accessing unit much like a radio   receiver. &nbsp;The actual storage place is somewhere else.

  Consider that in our waking reality our   memories are not recalled with 100% accuracy because we fill-in-the-gaps.&nbsp;   However, in the altered state of NDE consciousness, people describe the life   review as having greater than 100% recall of every event that happened to them   on earth.&nbsp; They will even describe how their actions on earth affected other   people.&nbsp; Many NDErs described being able to feel other people's feelings.&nbsp; Given   these discrepancies the  two  states of consciousness, it would tend to support Berkovich's   studies and suggest that memories are not stored in the brain, but rather in   that part of us that survives the body.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Memories   are embedded in different chunks of information based on what type of input and   emotion are attached to the event.&nbsp; Although the input process is different in   waking life and in the NDE state of consciousness, memory retrieval is the   same.&nbsp; In waking life, we have sensory input from our physical senses.&nbsp; This has   a tendency to frame our memories within certain emotions and frameworks attached   to these senses.&nbsp; Our waking memories are essentially of a third dimensional   perspective anchored by our senses within a three dimensional recall mechanism.&nbsp;

  On the other hand, in the NDE, the consciousness is free   from physical sensory input and flooded with abundant emotion and unbounded   perceptions (www.nderf.org,   Long, 2003).&nbsp; NDErs report brighter colors, 360 degree vision where they report   seeing without using their physical eyes, they hear such sounds as cannot be   described on earth, and they experience greater emotions.&nbsp; These perceptions are   consistent with what one would expect in a fourth or greater dimension (Long,   Jody, 2002).&nbsp;

  &nbsp;As observed in an earlier paper, emotions   are one of the few constants between altered states of consciousness (Long,   Jody, 2003). &nbsp;The intensity of emotion seems to drive the lucidity and ease of   recall of the experience.&nbsp; The more intense the emotion, the clearer a person   recalls the experience.&nbsp; As in the case of the NDE, the emotions are so intense   that they may create a &quot;flashbulb&quot; moment that is normally only seen in waking   consciousness.&nbsp; A &quot;flashbulb moment&quot; happens when the brain kicks into flight or   fight mode.&nbsp; The event becomes burned into the brain so that it can be replayed   at a later time when the person is not concerned about immediate survival.&nbsp;

  In the case of NDE, it is obvious that a   flashbulb moment cannot be created until after the person comes back to the   body.&nbsp; This would further support the argument that memories are stored outside   of the body because if the flashbulb moment has the same recall in waking life   and in the NDE, then the manner or place of recall should be the same.&nbsp; We know   that when someone is dead that the memories can't be in the brain, yet the   memories are crystal clear.&nbsp; And we know that a NDEr has total recall of a an   earthly life when they are not able to access their living brain for those   memories.&nbsp; People who do not readily recall the NDE may have subconscious   restrictions or strong coping mechanism protections.&nbsp; This is discussed below in   studies having to do with thin or thick boundary compartmentalization of the   brain.

Definition of dreams:

  To understand how dreaming and NDE might be   similar or different, it is helpful to review several concepts regarding   dreams.&nbsp; Dreams can be defined as, 'a series of images, ideas, etc., occurring   in certain stages of sleep' (American Heritage Dictionary, 1978).&nbsp; The common   understanding is that dreams are the workings of the subconscious brain in   processing our waking reality.&nbsp; A more formal definition is a non-conscious   electrophysiologic state while the body is alive (Pagel, 2001). &nbsp;A dream image   may be defined as any unit of self-generated conscious experience in the domains   of perception, cognition, or emotion. (Kahn &amp; Hobson, 1993)&nbsp; These dream images   arising from these three domains become integrated, interrelated, and contained   within a narrative/scenario framework such that our remembrance of dream events   is integrated into our subjective framework of reality.&nbsp; Carl Jung describes   dreams as part of the collective unconscious (Grosso, 1984).&nbsp;

Physical Aspect of   Dreaming:

  During the night most humans dream three to   four times per night.&nbsp; The brain goes into a certain state called rapid-eye   movement (REM) sleep.&nbsp; In that state, the brain sends signals to the rest of the   body that inhibit movement of the body and shuts down all body processes that   are not essential to metabolism.&nbsp; The brain is as active in the dream state as   it is in the waking state.&nbsp; The main difference is that there is no sensory   input in which to anchor the experience.&nbsp; The rational brain, otherwise known as   the mammalian brain, is not as active during REM sleep.&nbsp; But the pons, otherwise   known as the reptilian or primitive part of our brain, functions better because   the mammalian brain is not so dominant.&nbsp; The pons is the part of the brain that   stores the base emotions and is responsible for intuition.&nbsp; Therefore, because   of the lack of anchoring with our senses and the primitive nature of the pons,   dreams tend to be fluid, symbolic, and more emotional than in the waking state.&nbsp;   When one remembers dreams, it is the same process as remembering waking   reality.&nbsp;

  According to Alan Hobson and Robert McCarley,   they speculated that dreams are byproducts of the REM process, which are driven   by the lower parts of the brain (Ornstein, p.196). &nbsp;The dream is characterized   as the brain's attempt to make sense out of the random images triggered from the   chemical reactions as the body relaxes.&nbsp; Since all mammals experience REM sleep,   scientists conclude that dreaming must be a form of adaptation.&nbsp; People who   learned difficult tasks in the day show increased amounts of REM sleep that   night. REM sleep stimulates the nervous system, exercising connections and   keeping the brain fresh and ready for waking life (p.197).

  &nbsp;As one can tell, there are many different   aspects to defining dreaming, just as there are many aspects to defining a NDE,   mystical experience, or other altered states of consciousness.&nbsp; Commonalities in   defining altered states include the experience itself, the comparison of what   was experienced to our waking state of reality, contextualizing the event to   make sense to the rational brain, and ordering the experience so that it can be   communicated to self and others.

Dream Types:

There   are several types of dreams.&nbsp; An off-shoot of dream types is called 'lucid   dreaming.'&nbsp; The term was coined in a study released in 1913 by Dutch   psychiatrist Frederik van Eeden (www.spiritweb.org).   &nbsp;The primary distinction between ordinary dreaming and lucid dreaming is that in   ordinary dreaming, the dreamer does not know he or she is dreaming, and in lucid   dreaming, the dreamer knows it is a dream (Gillespie, 1997).&nbsp; It should be noted   that a couple responses tow the Near Death Experience Research Foundation   (NDERF) web-survey who answered 'yes' to the question, &quot;Was the experience dream   like in any way?&quot; did relate the similarity between lucid dreaming and NDEs.&nbsp;   These comparisons alluded to Shamans, or Native American religious practices.

There are   those dreams that are a part of downloading or processing of routine events, and   probably do originate from the physiological processes of the brain.&nbsp; Other   dreams may appear to originate from the stream of consciousness, and therefore,   are more similar to the NDE state of awareness.&nbsp; Ronda Snow describes two types   of dreams when comparing lucid dreams to those dreams encountered as part of an   after-death communication (ADC):&nbsp;

&quot;All the   dreams I've had that can be recalled well the next day have had several features   in common: they were in color, to varying degrees lucid, become a part of   long-term memory, and often are multi-sensory.&nbsp; The characteristics that made   the ADC dreams so different as to prompt further study were: dramatically   increased intensity...sounds and colors were much more pronounced and   clear...and the emotional content. Always before, dreams have been emotionless,   like watching a movie, or the emotions never persisted beyond the dream itself.   These dreams had a strong emotional effect...even days later&quot; (Edinger, 1984).

This anecdotal   account is consistent with Grosso's observation that both, dream experience and   NDE, stem from the same matrix of consciousness and involve the same mechanisms   (1983, p.22).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   An important finding in the study entitled Dreams and NDE was that dreams   rarely reproduced any part of the experience (Long, Jody and Long, Jeffrey,   2002).&nbsp; This is probably the strongest evidence indicating NDEs and dreams are   generally different states of consciousness.&nbsp; However, the similarities between   NDEs and lucid dreaming as described above may pose some interesting answers in   the study of the consciousness spectrum. For instance, a good case can be made   that as the NDEr consciously knows they are experiencing reality, so the lucid   dreamer knows they are dreaming.&nbsp; There may be a link between consciousness,   dreams and NDEs via the mechanism of lucid dreaming or OBEs.&nbsp; The special state   of consciousness during the OBE stage of the NDE will require considerable   further investigation before it is understood.

Psychological Aspect   of Dreaming:

In analyzing   dreams, Freud refers to the brain process of condensation.&nbsp; When a person   dreams, they connect or combine memories according to the emotions or emotional   concerns of the dreamer.&nbsp; (Harmann, E., 1996)&nbsp; This is consistent with recent   consciousness studies in the awake state that memory chunks for a particular   event are connected by accessing that particular emotional directory in the   brain.&nbsp; The primary difference in dreaming would be that instead of filling in   the gaps according to a particular event, one would access a particular   emotional directory whereby people and events associated with that emotion are   strung together into a fluid story.&nbsp;

The dream   process seems to consist of &quot;cross-connecting, making connections with whatever   related material is available in memory and imagination, guided by the dominant   emotions of the dreamer, which gradually become less intense and change their   character as the trauma is resolved or integrated&quot; (Harmann, E., 1996).&nbsp; In many   ways this type of emotional clearing is very similar to what is seen in the NDE   life review.&nbsp; The events have emotions attached to them and the person makes a   choice to change the behavior pattern.&nbsp; In Harmann's study of people after   experiencing severe trauma, &quot;the powerful emotion of the dreamer guides the   dreaming process to choose or illuminate patterns in the memory nets related to   that emotional concern.&quot;

Dreams may   also serve as a form of creative thought because we are free from constraints of   the physical world and this allows for different types of cross-connections   between thoughts.&nbsp;

&quot;Einstein was   asked by Jacques Hadamard about the nature of his thinking while doing   mathematics, he said that &quot;the combinatory play [of images] seems to be the   essential feature in productive thought--before there is any connection with   logical construction in words or other kinds of signs which can be communicated   to others. . . . [These] have to be sought for laboriously only in the secondary   stage, when the . . . associative play is sufficiently established and can be   reproduced at will.&quot; Einstein says that his images are primarily of the &quot;visual   and some, of [the] muscular type.&quot; (States, B, 2000)

Personality Thickness or Thinness   Boundaries:

Another way to   look at how dreams, NDE, and waking life subjectively interrelate is by looking   at the thickness or thinness of boundaries an individual may have.&nbsp; The issue of   thinness or thickness of boundaries is not a new concept.&nbsp; According to Abraham   Maslow an individual's capacity to experience transcendent states depends on a   quality of openness that permits them to occur (Kohr, p. 171).&nbsp; Maslow observed   that those with thick boundaries, he termed as &quot;constricted personalities,&quot; tend   to block out peak experiences.&nbsp; Harmann describes boundaries as:

&quot;a dimension   of personality which relates to the degree of separateness or   compartmentalization (thickness) versus fluidity or merging (thinness) in all   mental functions.&nbsp; Someone with very thick boundaries keeps perceptions,   thoughts, and feelings distinct and separate; keeps time and space well   organized; tends to think in black and white; has a clear demarcated sense of   self; and is usually very solid, well defended, sometimes even rigid. Someone   with very thin boundaries is the opposite: may experience synesthesia; allows   thoughts and feelings to merge; often has vivid fantasies, not always   distinguished from reality; is less well defended; tends to think in shades of   gray; has a less solid sense of self; and becomes over-involved in   relationships&quot; (Harmann, E., 1996).

Consequently, the &quot;thicker&quot; or more   rigid the person, the less dreams the person reported.&nbsp; While the &quot;thinner&quot; or   more fluid the person, the more dreams and waking reality blended.&nbsp;

According to   Richard Kohr, NDErs demonstrated at greater degree of openness towards dream   states than those who are close to death or non-experiencers (Kohr, 1983).&nbsp;   NDErs reported more color, types and number of sense modalities, and unusual   dream states.&nbsp; Additionally, NDErs reported greater intentionality in recalling   dreams and a greater tendency to regard them as helpful.&nbsp; NDErs reported greater   intensity, meaning, and positive quality of personal meditation sessions,   greater consistency in maintaining a meditation schedule, or days per week   engaging in meditation, and the more positive influence of meditation on daily   life.&nbsp; This suggests that there might be a predisposition of NDErs to have thin   boundaries of compartmentalized thought as described by Harmann above, or   perhaps it is the near death experience that causes NDErs to become less   compartmentalized and more fluid in their thinking.

Palmer did   some relevant research in 1979 in an attempt to understand the relationship   between dreaming, mystical states, and paranormal experiences.&nbsp; (Kohr, p.170)&nbsp;   Palmer found that the ease of dream recall and tendency towards lucid dreaming   are indicators of the 'degree to which the conscious mind is capable of gaining   access to the content of the unconscious mind (p. 171).&quot;&nbsp; The conclusion from   the study was that the relationship between psychic phenomena and mystical   states follow from the availability of the unconscious in the waking state.&nbsp; He   further suggested that the rational brain must be suppressed to inhibit   repressive ego mechanisms that would keep the mystical state or psychic   phenomena from reaching the waking brain.&nbsp;

This is   consistent with what we know of consciousness.&nbsp; According to Ornstein, the brain   evolved to enable us to respond to emergency situations as part of a survival   mechanism (1991).&nbsp; Therefore, the subconscious brain handles most of the input   we receive from our physical senses.&nbsp; The only things that make it to the   mammalian brain are those that are serious enough to require attention.&nbsp; This   effectively sets a threshold level screening where most thoughts or sensory   input are ignored by the higher brain.&nbsp; This research is also consistent with   Harmann's boundary research.&nbsp; Those who experience NDEs, mystical states, and   psychic phenomena have thinner boundaries.&nbsp; Consequently, experiences that might   be screened out or ignored by those with thicker boundaries are not recognized   as authentic.&nbsp; However, to those who have thinner boundaries, they are able to   experience and see things that others cannot.&nbsp;

Dr. van Lommel   noted that age may play a part in whether a person experiences a NDE when they   die and come back.&nbsp; For adults, the number is between 5-12% depending on   which survey statistics are used.&nbsp; Dr. Melvin Morse, 85% of children who   die and come back experience a NDE.&nbsp; Children typically have a lesser   developed ego than adults, and therefore would have thinner boundaries.&nbsp;   Therefore, the ego (used as sense of self), or thickness of boundaries may play   a part in whether or not a person can access the NDE information from the   subconscious.&nbsp; It might even mean that everyone experiences a NDE, but only   those with thinner boundaries can recall the experience.&nbsp; Further study   would be necessary before this can be a firm conclusion.

Experience   Interpretation:

There is a   German concept of &quot;Umwelt&quot; that states that in a species specific universe final   reality is relative to the perceiver (States, B, 2000).&nbsp; There is no &quot;immaculate   perception&quot; of reality or a superior point of view.&nbsp; States points out that &quot;for   humans to live on earth, the species accepts what we perceive of earth as our   reality.&nbsp; If we lived in a world with different probability ratios, we would   involuntarily use them as the yardstick for measuring the reality of other   possible worlds.&quot;&nbsp; Consequently, a person cannot have an unreal emotion or   unreal experience.&nbsp; Accordingly, it does not matter &quot;whether it occurs in a   dream or in broad daylight is incidental to its status as an experience;   therefore the reality of any &quot;immaculate&quot; or transcendental world outside the   experience is completely beside the point. The experience itself predicates the   world in which it takes place.&quot;&nbsp; Ironically, the only way that we can tell the   difference between a dream and waking reality is by comparing the memories to   what we know through our physical senses.&nbsp;

&quot;All that an   organism can do constitutes its cognitive domain.&nbsp; Otherwise, one must say that   all creatures are deluded, all of the time, because all creatures, including   physicists and mathematicians, live in a world constrained by limited cognitive   domains. The wasp is being quite &quot;logical&quot; in dealing with its problem. Our   &quot;higher&quot; perspective on its logic may reveal a truth of which the wasp is   unaware, but to imply a state of delusion is to assume the wasp is capable of   saying to itself, &quot;Something funny is going on here,&quot; and fails to do so. The   wasp has no more capability in this regard than the dreamer: it must solve its   problem its own waspish way and that is to do it over again, as often as   necessary, in the very same way&quot; (States, B., 2000).

In recalling   dreams, one has to be able to reconstruct them in a narrative that makes sense   to self and others.&nbsp; This narrative reconstruction takes place in NDEs, and can   occur from certain events in waking reality.&nbsp; 'A text is, literally, a 'weaving   together' of the elements taken from a specific code in order to communicate   something'&nbsp; (Kilroe, 2000).&nbsp; Since the text of dreams and NDEs are outside of   our experience of reality, people have trouble communicating about these altered   states.&nbsp; It is difficult to conform what happens in the dream or the NDE &quot;to our   expectations of an intelligible whole.&quot; (Freud, as quoted in Kilroe, 2000)

&quot;We have   dreams during the night and we have learned how to interpret them during the   day.&nbsp; . . . When we come to submit a dream to interpretation, we find that the   erratic and irregular arrangements of its constituent parts is quite unimportant   from the point of view of our understanding it. . . . The essential elements in   a dream are the dream-thoughts, and these have meaning, connection and order.&nbsp; .   . .The elements of the dream, apart from their being condensed, are almost   invariably arranged in a new order more or less independent of their earlier   arrangement.&nbsp; Finally, it must be added that whenever the original material of   the dream-thoughts has been turned into by the dream activity is been subjected   to a further influence.&nbsp; This is what is known as 'secondary revision,' and its   purpose is evidently to get rid of the disconnectedness and unintelligibility   produced by the dream activity and replace it by a new meaning.&nbsp; But this new   meaning, arrived at by secondary revision, is no longer the meaning of the dream   thoughts.&quot; (Freud, 1950, pp. 118-119)

METHODOLOGY

  With the background of dreams, NDE, altered   states, processing of reality, and consciousness studies, one can start to piece   together the results from a web survey submitted to the Near Death Experience   Research Foundation (NDERF).&nbsp; Informed consent is given in the web-form   introduction and instructions that discloses the purpose of the survey, use of   the material submitted, assurance of confidentiality to the extent requested by   the contributors, and lack of compensation for participation in the survey.&nbsp;   This questionnaire contains a section for NDErs to share a narrative of their   experience and asks over 50 questions regarding demographics, experience   elements, and aftereffects.&nbsp; Out of 650 people who responded, 318 (48.9%) met   the NDERF definition of NDE.&nbsp; For research purposes, NDERF uses the definition   that a NDE is &quot;a lucid experience associated with perceived consciousness apart   from the body occurring at the time of actual or threatened imminent death.&quot;

  Analyzed were narrative responses to the two   of the most relevant questions on the survey:&nbsp; 1) &quot;What was your level of   consciousness and alertness during the experience?&quot;; and 2) &quot;Was the experience   dream like in any way?'

RESULTS

  &nbsp;Of 318 NDEs submitted, 307 (96.5%) answered   the narrative question, &quot;What was your level of consciousness and alertness   during the experience?&quot;&nbsp; Quantitatively, this was not a very good question   because many people said that their level of consciousness was zero because they   were dead.&nbsp; However, qualitatively the answers spoke volumes with 226 (73.6%)   NDErs reported being wide awake, very alert, more alert than normal, or being   very conscious.&nbsp; Many who gave narrative explanations described the distinction   between the totally unconscious body and the hyper-alert state of consciousness   they had entered as a consequence of being dead.

  &nbsp;There were 311 NDErs (97.7%) who responded   &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; or &quot;uncertain&quot; to the web-form question 'Was the experience dream   like in any way?'&nbsp; Of those who answered, 192 participants (62.5%) gave   narrative explanations.&nbsp; While it is recognized that the question may have a   bias in favor of affirmative answers, the intent was to encourage NDErs to share   any conceivable relation between their NDE and dreams to the greatest extent   possible.&nbsp; Out of the 311 narrative responses to this question, 233 (74.9% were   classified as 'no,' 74 (23.8%) as 'yes,' and 4 (1.3) as 'Uncertain.&quot;&nbsp; Of the   participants, 115 (36.9%) did not give an explanation: 99 (31.8%) answered &quot;no&quot;   and 16 (5.1%) answered &quot;yes.&quot;

  &nbsp;Out of the 311 responses, 192 of the answers   had additional comments which were analyzed for clues as to what NDErs   considered dreamlike and not dreamlike.&nbsp; The highest category of 68 NDErs   (21.9%) defined what makes the experience dreamlike is in terms of reality.&nbsp;   NDErs talk about reality in terms of what we know on earth as observed through   our physical sensory input.&nbsp; Other narrative responses contrasted the NDE to   dreams in terms of &quot;intensity, vividness, stronger than a dream&quot; 23 (7.2%),   &quot;reality is over there&quot; 21(6.6%), and ease of recall 15(4.7%).&nbsp;

  &nbsp;The individual comments were further   categorized into concepts.&nbsp; Again, the biggest concept that 97(50.5%) NDErs   discussed distinguishing dreams from NDE had to do with reality, with comments   such as &quot;very real, not unreal, reality is over there, like being there, felt   like I was awake.&quot;&nbsp; NDErs, 58 (30.2%), discussed concepts involving memories or   recall with comments such as, &quot;intensity, vividness, stronger than a dream, ease   of recall, remember it like it just happened, clarity, level of knowledge or   understanding.&quot;&nbsp; Dreamlike qualities were described by 49 (25.5%) NDErs in terms   of &quot;surreal, not like an ordinary dream, odd, strange, floating, flying, like a   dream but felt different, the tunnel and void and white light were dreamlike,   some parts of the NDE morphed or changed, the NDE started out unreal and then   changed, the NDE had aspects of vision quests or lucid dreaming.&quot;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Other concepts consisting of comparisons of NDE to dreams were in terms of 1)   emotions 8(4.2%), &quot;feelings &amp; emotions, more peaceful, no fear&quot;; 2)&nbsp; perception   14 (7.3%) &quot;contiguous, sequential, like watching a play or movie, time/space   distorted, couldn't control the course of events&quot;; 3) body perceptions 13   (6.8%), &quot;no pain or sickness, could not feel body, seeing colors&quot;; and 4) no   prior framework 4 (2.1%), &quot;too young, ineffable.

DISCUSSION&nbsp;

  One of the most striking things to me, when I   started to attend Seattle IANDS meetings, was when I listen to NDErs talk about   their experiences.&nbsp; I soon found myself questioning, &quot;What is reality?&quot;&nbsp; This   dream study discusses the altered states in terms of consciousness, reality,   memory recall, narrative reconstruction and integrating the experience into the   earthly reality.

  &nbsp;Since most NDErs indicated their experience   was not dreamlike in any way, we need to consider what constitutes dreaming and   why an NDE might be different.&nbsp; If over 73% of NDErs say the experience is not   dreamlike, then what was it like?&nbsp;

  &nbsp;Basically, NDErs go through the same process   that everyone else does when they recall an experience that occurred in an   altered state.&nbsp; The reason we know that we are in an altered state to begin with   is how the memories compare to our earthly reality.&nbsp; At first, all NDErs can do   is react to the experience.&nbsp; It may take days or years to fully be able to   contextualize any vivid experience outside of our waking reality.&nbsp; The brain   tries to make sense and order the experience to be able to reduce it to text.&nbsp;   From the text it is further processed in the brain as a narrative in a   subjective story form that makes sense to the individual and later, retold to   make sense to others.&nbsp; NDEs, or at least the ones that we know about, are   intense enough to pass the subconscious threshold and can be processed in the   logical part of the brain.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;We know some dreams are not vivid enough to   pass the subconscious threshold into long term memory for later recall.&nbsp; Other   dreams are so intense, that they are readily recalled.&nbsp; The clearer the events   and the ease of recall, the more the experiencers identified the experience as   'not dreamlike.'&nbsp; This is consistent with reports from those who experience   spiritually transformative events, mystical states, out of body experiences, or   any other subjective paranormal experience.&nbsp; Moreover, it is suggested that the   vivid dreams may have either its origins from the stream of consciousness or   that the memory is so vivid that it is embedded in the stream of consciousness.&nbsp;   When this happens, the memory is integrated with waking memories and plays a   part in how we perceive what is real.

  &nbsp;NDEs   are described in terms of reality, intensity, ease of recall, and physical   perceptions.&nbsp; Certain types of dreams have these characteristics too.&nbsp; (www.oberf.org)&nbsp;   NDEs for the most part have a sense of purpose and a definite order to them.&nbsp;   The logical flow of events is generally not interrupted, like what one might see   while dreaming and then the alarm clock goes off.&nbsp; Dreams are described as more   fluid, with qualities that don't exist in our world (like floating), non-linear   with non-sequential events.&nbsp; The purpose for a dream is rarely found without   some reflection on the emotions of the dream.&nbsp; For most NDErs, they describe   their level of perception as being hyper alert or lucid during the experience.&nbsp;   Only certain types of dreams contain the hyper-alert state or lucid dreaming.&nbsp;   Here are a few comments:

  &nbsp;&quot;It seemed real, not floaty and jumping   between topics as in dreams&quot; - Tsagali

  &nbsp;&quot;Unlike anything my imagination could   create&quot; - James

  &nbsp;&quot;This world seems like a dream, and the   other world seems natural&quot; - J.C.

  &nbsp;&quot;It was like leaving your body as energy, I   can see my energy body form: no it was&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   like, going there in person, like being on a weekend trip&quot;&nbsp; - Frank

  &nbsp;&quot;Nothing about it was like a dream.&nbsp; It was   the most real I've ever known&quot; - Christine

  &nbsp;&quot;I was unconscious physically, but more   alert/conscious than I had ever experienced before or since.&nbsp; Like a window had   been cleaned that you did not know was dirty until you saw the difference&quot; -   Sheila

  &nbsp;In order for successful integration of the   experience into everyday reality, many NDErs were found to exhibit more flexible   thought processes than those with thick, compartmentalized views of the world.&nbsp;   This thought process was similar in mystical and other altered states.&nbsp; It would   be interesting to know if the thinness of boundaries between the conscious and   subconscious is a result of the NDE or if this state of being was in existence   prior to the NDE.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;Some NDErs thought the experience was   dreamlike because there simply were no words to describe what happened.&nbsp; Some   experiencers expressed doubts regarding the reality of the experience and   concluded it was dreamlike.&nbsp; One NDEr called the NDE a dream to avoid ridicule   from his wife and friends.&nbsp; Interestingly, there were accounts from two children   who grew up calling their experience a dream because they did not have the   framework to call it anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp; In their adulthood, and after discovering   NDEs, they now define their experience as not dreamlike.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;The out of body (OBE) component of the NDE,   typically the place where most of the floating, flying, or free movement, is   that considered by some NDErs as dreamlike.&nbsp; The comments, following the 'yes,'   'mixed,' and 'unsure' responses, seemed to focus more on the out of body   component of the experience by likening the floating sensation, or that of   moving without effort, to what they experience in dreams.&nbsp; Typical analogies to   a dream were, 'only when I was floating I felt I lost control of myself,' or 'in   a sense, it was a dreamy feeling, in general, somewhat surreal,' or 'it all   seemed very odd and strange.'&nbsp;

  &nbsp;Perceptions played a part in how one   classified the experience.&nbsp; Those who watched themselves 14 (7.3%), such as   seeing in slow motion, on a stage or in a movie, or experiencing a life review,   were more likely to consider the experience dreamlike.&nbsp; However, those who   categorized according to a sequence of events would most likely say that the   experience started out dreamlike, but then changed to non-dreamlike.&nbsp; Again,   this would support the earlier finding that the OBE component of the NDE would   most likely be considered dreamlike and that after the OBE, that portion would   tend to contained the non-dreamlike components.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;The NDErs who related the experience to the   body, were more likely to call the experience not dreamlike.&nbsp; These were people   who related the experience to the body by noting lack of pain, or they noticed   the heart stopped beating, so they knew the experience was really happening.&nbsp;   However, 1.9% of the responses considered the visual element to be dreamlike by   likening the colors and the brightness of what they saw as 'dreamlike.'&nbsp; Those   who related the elements of the experience to emotions 8 (4.2%), would tend to   call the experience more dreamlike.&nbsp; These people likened the extreme feelings   of love, peacefulness, and etc., to being more like a dream.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;The case has been made regarding the   similarity of processing the NDE, mystical states, and subjective paranormal   experiences, in terms of our earthly reality.&nbsp; After reviewing the data, one   cannot help but question if we limit ourselves by processing these experiences   in terms of our earthly reality.&nbsp; As noted by States above, even though people   might be very &quot;logical&quot; in dealing with integrating their experiences, viewing   reality from a higher perspective may reveal a truth of which most humans are   unaware.&nbsp; And analogous to the wasp, those who solve the problem in a different   way does not make them delusional.&nbsp; Some people are only capable of looking at   altered states of consciousness in terms of earthly reality.&nbsp; They reinforce   their reality over and over again, as often as necessary, in the very same way.&nbsp;   Others with thinner boundaries can perceive these experiences from a different   reality perspective.&nbsp; Which way of processing the experience is correct does not   matter because &quot;[t]he experience itself predicates the world in which it takes   place&quot; (States, B., 2000).

  &nbsp;Upon review of the similarities and   differences between dreams, NDE, and how we process reality, memories and recall   of those memories are processed the same way.&nbsp; It appears that there are many   similarities between NDEs and dreams when the dreams are vivid enough to be   remembered.&nbsp; From the data, it would suggest that NDEs and dreams are altered   states of consciousness.&nbsp; From NDEs it is evident that consciousness survives   the body and so do the memories created during our lifetime.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;There are certain types of boundaries   between the conscious brain and the subconscious brain.&nbsp; Those people with thick   boundaries tend to compartmentalize and rigidly store their memories in certain   portions of the brain.&nbsp; Recall for these people tends to be very cut and dried.&nbsp;   Reality is firmly grounded in what they can sense on earth.&nbsp; However, people   with thin boundaries define reality very differently because they are able to   access different parts of the subconscious during the waking state.&nbsp; NDErs and   those people who report frequent dreaming typically fall into the category of   thin boundaries.&nbsp; Reality is a blend from many states of consciousness.

  &nbsp;Intriguing concepts come to mind when   determining whether boundaries between the conscious and unconscious brain can   be made thicker or thinner.&nbsp; In my mind, I think the dilemma could be likened to   what comes first, the chicken or the egg.&nbsp; For instance, if the brain is   considered a receiver, then is it possible that the consciousness stream itself   causes the brain to receive in a certain manner?&nbsp; This results in a top to   bottom analysis.&nbsp; Or is it heredity, where the brain structure itself limits the   amount of consciousness that can be received by an individual?&nbsp; That would make   it a bottom to top analysis.&nbsp; Or perhaps there could be certain rules for   two-way communication between brain and consciousness?&nbsp;

  &nbsp;Fruitful research might be to see if recall   of different types of altered consciousness experience occur in different or   similar parts of the brain.&nbsp; It would follow that if the brain is a storage   receiver unit, by isolating the part of the brain that accesses information   stored in consciousness we might be able to somehow access consciousness without   using the brain as a receiver.&nbsp; Applications could be useful for people who   suffer from Alzheimer's disease, suffer head injuries, or are in a coma.

Palmer's   research would suggest that most people can be trained or re-programmed to relax   their boundaries so the subconscious threshold is lower and can allow the   signals to flow to the conscious brain. &nbsp;Further study in this direction could   enhance awareness of how the body interacts with consciousness and perhaps allow   us to utilize fourth dimensional concepts to make life better for mankind.&nbsp;   Access to a world that the overwhelming majority of NDErs describe as one of   total love, peace, knowledge, and connectedness to the Supreme Being is worth   the study efforts.
