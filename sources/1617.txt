    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Ghourki, The.
 1901-1908?  Monthly, "from time to time"
 Morgantown, WV.  Editor: Howard Llewellyn Swisher.
 1/1,August 1901.  Twenty-five cents a year.

 Advertised in Soundview, September 1907, as the organ of the Tribe of the Ghourki, and in The Swastika, July 1908.  The tribe was "an association of those who think for themselves."  The Chief of the Ghourki was Swisher (1870- ).  The journal featured the sayings of Moocha Saha ("I’d rather go to church than to go to hell, but I don’t have to go to either place.") who is called one of the satellites of the Chief of the tribe.    Regular contributions by J. William Lloyd.  This was a product of one of the prairie socialists and rural philosophers of the time, like Rader’s Soundview, Phiher’s Social Thought and New World, Morgan’s Fireside Paper, and  Calvert’s Open Road.  They were all freethinking in tendency and socialist in economics and generally open to fringe medicine, spiritualism and New Thought.  William Allen White described the breed in 1906 in describing the mind-set of "Old Hen":  "'Old Hen' worked in a tin-shop, read Ruskin, regarded [Eugene V.] Debs as a prophet, received many papers devoted to socialism and the New Thought, and believed that he believed in no man, no God and no devil.  Also he was a woman-hater, and though he never turned his head for a petticoat, preached free-love and bought many books which promised to tell him how to become a hypnotist.  At various times, Larmy's category of beliefs included the single-tax, Buddhism, spiritualism, and a faith in the curative properties of blue glass." William Allen White, In Our Town (1906).
