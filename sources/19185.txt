a story that I put out was very simple
it was what Colonel Blanchard said he
wanted put into a press release when the
colonel tells the first lieutenant
almost verbatim what he wants in a press
release guess what
he gets you don&#39;t argue with them and
say oh I think it sound better if we set
it this way or the next way the answer
to all was yes sir so what exactly did
the press release a in essence it was
very simple to the effect that we had in
our possession of flying saucer it was
found on a ranch up north of Roswell it
was being flown to general Rama&#39;s office
that being the next higher command that
was the 8th Air Force and that was the
end of it
information that I got was given to me
almost verbatim by Colonel Blanchard and
he written off of a scratch pad that he
had in front of them what he was saying
to me and I was writing it down and
after we got all through it a kind of
odd and he said I want you to give it to
the local newspapers and radio stations
and do it po taste and all he got in
reply was a yes sir and a way I went I
meant that they put all the hunks and
pieces in it I think it was at that time
o c-54 aircraft that they loaded up
primarily with the material and that
aeroplane was flown the material was not
flown that was pretty well orchestrated
I think the thought of handling it that
way came down from Washington through
channels and we were told that we were
all wrong that it was just a weather
balloon and that was the only thing that
I think we heard was well that&#39;s the end
of that story
shouldn&#39;t have printed all that to start
with and you know this type of thing
these things happen when you&#39;ve got a
whole bunch of rank going way above you
and you&#39;re just a little first
lieutenant down on the bottom of the
pile I think more than anything else I
was saying oh god I hope that this thing
doesn&#39;t blow up in our face and that was
so easy some of these things that would
come to fore in the military they just
got out of hand
and I was just hoping that this would be
one that would pleasantly bury itself I
think that there was it lots and lots of
cover-up I can&#39;t verify that just my
sincere feeling is that the thing was
something from outer space
and we decided that I say we the
military decided that our public may not
accept it very graciously something
coming from outer space and hitting our
own earth it&#39;s a little bit hard to get
a lot of the people to accept it they
could come out with every word about it
and every description today and the
public would say well oh I&#39;ve seen that
I remember something about but how was a
Popeye cartoon doing I I&#39;m using that as
the from one extreme to the other today
people don&#39;t care that much about
something that happened 50 years ago he
gave us a piece of metal but he took him
a flying saucer exchanged we exchanged
in the bars back later
as you bought one last thing if you only
had a moment to speak in open
congressional hearings to discuss what
happened 50 years ago what would you say
I say had it happened and I&#39;d add on to
that
give us information to the young people
of the world in this country
