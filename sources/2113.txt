PREFACE.
Tru: quaint, nod, in the estimate of fo.atidioua critics, the l'ulge.r
term which i.s employed upon tho title page ofthia work may, io
the opinion of many readere, be eJ1:ceptionable; and by such, llil
apology for its use may be e:ipected. While the pnrtil!lllls of
each oftbe sects,-in scienoe, philosopliy, and religion,-which
have been chosen for llllimadverBion, may loudly protest o.gninst
the profanation of their favourite study, or chosen occupation, by
cla9eifying it with the lnnnbuga of the day. Believers in the
"celestial science of Animal Magnetism,n for eumple, will be
11hocked at lhe high handed wickedn s of placing them on a level
with the deluded victims ofUJtm-Abolitionism ; - while the di.s-
11iples oftbc latter delusion will be so oulrllged in their pious feel­
ings, nt being classed with the former, that they will anathematize
the author, for having "named the two ill the same day;" and
still wol'!lc for having given their" hobby" so conspicuous a place
in this gallery of humbugs. Indeed it is posS!ole that those who
have become the dupes of either of the impostures which are the
subjects ofthe present volume, whilo they have not yet &lrallowed
the reat, will admit the justice of the homely epithet by which all
the others nre designated, and only complain ofits inappropriate­
ness to themselvc�, or their creed. So lhat it i.s plain, from the.l!e
and the like reflections, that in ushering this volume into the world,
tbe aalhor can expect little mercy, or qu11.1ter, from that portion of
the public, who haye already been ensnared among the victims of
l*
ri
the impoltu1'9. upon popular credulity, 'IJbich he here reprobatee,
and condemns. Thrir fanaticism may be, and probably ill, incu­
rable by human means; but it ia with the uninitiated, and umo­
phisticated portion ofthe community, -withthe rising generation
especially, -that he hopes to be succeasful, in prnenling 'IJhat be
might otherwise fail-to remedy.
In explanation ofthe employment of the inelegant phrase,"hum­
bug," as the qualifying epithet for each of the subjects herein de­
scribed, the author would allege its singular appropriateness, and
its conventional use; as well as the authority of Noah Webster,
that veteran lexicographer, who defines this word to signify "an
impoalure.'' .By this latter synonyme, we understand any system
of science, philosophy, or religion, which "seems to be what it is
not.'' And when such a system ia found to "steal away men's
brains," by ingenious sophisms and false logic; or by its appeal•
to the corrupt and baser passions of the shallow thinkers, who
abound in every community ; or in any other way intoxicating
the " weak sistera and female brethren," whoae intellectual imb.e­
cility rend�rs them an easy prey to deluaion ; such an imposture
is 1urely, by way of eminence, entitled to be called a humbug.
Th.e greater the sanctimonious pretensions of those who practise
upon the popular credulity; -the louder their professions of su­
perlative or exclusive humanity, philosophy, or religion ; ...... the
more marvellous and supernatural the signs, wonders, and disco­
veries, of which they proclaim themselves the inventors and pro­
prietors, the more dangerous and mischievous they are to the pub­
lic, and the greater reason there is that they should be detected
and exposed.
But while each of the parties criticised in the present work may
complain of being described as the dupes to their chosen humbug
,
there are more who will be disappointed that so few species of tho
Pa&J'Aca.
genus are named, out. ofthe great multitade ofreigning hambup
with which our city and country abounds. And to liuch the au­
thor would say that he hi.a only introduced a few of the more
prominent speciel; because neither his leisure, nor the limitl of
this single volume would suffice, ·for a more extended investiga­
tion; though he is aware that there are multiplied examplee of
popular delusion, which are perhaps equaUy entitled to animad­
version, and equally to be deprecated. He has, however, been
careful to introduce the most successful, and the most mischievous
among the reigning impostures ; -and especially those, to a11ault
which requires either great morn! courage, or entit:e inditf
erence
to personal vituperation. Ofthe former, the author-is ashamed to
confess, he has too little; and for the goodly portion of the latter,
which he has acquired, he is indebted to the experience he has d&o
rived by former conflicts with the votaries of some of these, and
the like fiagitious humbugs. And having here encountered the
most rormiclable of the tribe, and exposed himself to the running
fire of the whole phalanx of the most prominent impostors and
their dupes; when-he shall have outlived their combined resent­
ment, he may possibly gather time and strength for volume No. 2,
•
in the same aeries, after volume No. 1, shall have done its work.
Meanwhile should another and an abler hand extend favour to the
benevolent object ofiliis work, by expostulation with the American
public against being devoured by imported fanaticism, and trans­
atlantic humbug, such an author would, ifsuccessful, be indeed a
public benefactor. He would deserve the thanks of every patriot,
philanthropist, and Christian, throughout this land·; and he would
recieve this reward from all f!uch, as are not already engulphed in
the vortex of popular frenzy and enthusiasm.
The present humble effort, it is devoutly hoped, will contribute
to encourage the preparation ofa more ample and elaborate work,
from some of those statesmen, pbilosophe11, philanthropists, or
Pa&rAC&.
difties, 'lfhole ruunee, ability, ani inluence, may CCllllD1end their
appeal to their countrymen, and reetore the dominion of common
1e1111e, which may otbertriH be annihilated by the desolatin& ten­
dencyofreigning delu.eion. Sach a work would be worthy oftbe
mightiest eirort of the mightiest mind, among the wise and good .
oftbia land ; and the author will not have written in vain, iC this
reeult should follow ; aad in such a cue, he would find an abun­
dant recompense, even if the feebleness and the imperfectiona of
this little volume should prove the provocative to a wiser head and
a better heart; by enlisting·his energies in the conftict with the
frauds and impostures which overrun our beloved country, and
which menace the overthrow ofboth reason and reli{fon, from the
popular creed and practice.

l_T has been facetiously remarked, that 0 man fs the
only beiog endowed with the power of laughter, and per­
haps he is the only oae w ho deserves to be laughed
at." And were it not for the humiliatiog exhibition of
our commoo nature, which the follies and frailties of
mankind are ever developing, a " laughing philosopher"
mighthave perpetual employment. Instead, however, of
indulging our risible faculties at the expense of human
folly and popular delusions, it is too common to direct
our laughter at the vic tims of the one oc the other.
The fo.rmer are fit subjects for ridicule and censure,
while the latter are often entitled rather to our commia­
seration, since it is their misfortune, pot their fault, that
they have been thus deluded.
2
J.f l1'TR O DUC T O ll.Y O B iEBVATI ONI.
The diltinction so obvious between fanaticism itself,
and its infatuated dupes, seems too often overlooked. It
is for this reason that he who benevolentJy labours to
detect imposture and expose error, however discrimi­
nating he may be in separating men'• errors from their
peraons, finds all bis arguments and remonstrances mis­
applied by his reader11 ; and the misguided votaries of
popular detusion, regard the assault upon their creed,
aimed directly at themselves. This. results from the
fact that men habitually identify themselve1:1, their names,
and character, with the dogmas of every system they
embrace, and when that system is fouuded in error and
enthusiasm, the party spirit whic h· it ini!!pires, burns
with an intensity, which absorbs reason, conscience,
and religion itself, in its unhallowed flame.
Hence those who are gulled into n belief in any one
·or more of the numerous humbugs which abound in this
age of ultraism, seem to regard themselves to have
" pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred
honour," for the support and defence of every jot and
tiUll! of their new scheme, whether it be ooe of science,
philant hropy, or religion. .Accor<liogly, to venture the
expression of an opinion adTerse to the verity, or phi-
. Josophical correctnees of such nov.elties, and especially
to hazard an attempt at their refutation, will expose one
to rancoroua hostility, and uomingled .censoriousness.
And ev.en wheu the system can· be shown to ,be built
upon radical and fundamental error, by arguments and
facts which commend themselves �th to reason anti
religion ; and when the tendencies of such errors can
be.demon:ttrated to be "evil, only eTil, and that coa­
_uually ;" yet stm, -no benevole.nce ofmotive, no �
of kindness and conciliation of manner, ao fainest or

c1ndour of reasoning, can pr�ect aa antagonist from
� apathemM of the. cliq.u who have em� &QC}
prepagated the. humbug.
It is for thisreason that many:we andgoodmea laaH
refraioed fromthrcnving tltems.elves i.Dtothebreach,under
such circumstances ; though they have fully realiMd,
and deeply deplored, the folly and iafatuaiion which ia
'raging arQund them. Not that they are deficieat in
moraicourage for the work, nor would they shrink from
the fiery arrows to which an attmnpt to stay the plague
would expose them. But they withhold their hand
from the consideration of the fruitlessness of £be effort
fo reason against such sublimated folly, 11uch double
distilled nonsense, as popular credulity is perpetually
swallowing. And, . moreover, many such indulge the
hope that aucb is the fury of the zealots of these seve­
ral impostures, that they will preselltly burn out by the
intensity of their own fires.
UnhappiJy, however, those who have buckled on the
armour �gainst the follies ofthe times, have been often
unwise and indiscreet in the cha,racter and spirit of
their measures. Disgusted by the stupidity of the vie·
tims of delusion, and provoked by
'
their obstinate adhe­
sion to error, they have assailed them personally, in­
stead of attacking the false. philosophy and pseudo·phi­
lanthropy by which they have been imposed upon; and
thu� they have made a show ef intolerance which bas
been fatal to their success. They seem to have been
unmindful of' the sentiment, that " error of opinion may
be safely tolerated, while reason is left free to combl!-t
it." For although th�· force o( reason may be ia;ipo­
tent with that species of' infuriated inunity called fa.na­
tic_:ism, and hence fail.U1 coovertiug its unhappy victim•

&<>11_1 the error oftheir way•; yet the great body of the
community wiD always possess enough ofintelligence,
to be influenced by true philosophy and sound logic. Be­
sides, there is an omnipotence in the majesty of truth,
which will ultimately constrain the homage of the world.
Persecution only serves to propagate new theories,
whether of philosophy or religion, as the history of�
world demonstrates; and this it has never failed to do,
whether those theories were true or false. They ac­
quire fresh vigour under the blows of intolerance, and
like vivacious insects seem to multiply by dissection.
Hence, every attempt to put down impostors, or en­
thusiasts, by censoriousness and invective, directed
against them personally, because of their follies or their
crimes, has ever been unsuccessful. They are them­
selves so sensible that opposition of this kind promotes
their cause, that they desire, invite, and even provoke
it. Indeed some of the popular follies of the .times
are indebted solely to the real or alleged persecutions
they have suffered, not only for the number of their vo­
taries, but even for their present existence; and but for
this they would long since have descended to the tomb
of the capulets, " unwept, unhonoured, and unsung."
The remark has been often repeated, but it has there­
by lost none of its propriety or truth, that " Ridicule
bas ever been the most powerful enemy to enthusiasm,
and is often the only arrtagonist that can be opposed to
it with success.'' It is true that this is a weapon, ifin­
discriminately applied, which wounds both ways, and
may be thus rendered effective against truth as well as
error. Still, however, there is high and even sacred au­
thority for the employment of ridicule against acknow­
ledge<I evils, and popular infatuation. It should, how·

tTei, never be relied en 10Jely in. controTersial writing,
eince it derogates from the dignity ofthe subject, and
detracts from the infiuence ofitl &llthor. It may, how.
ever, and ought to be employed as an auxili�ry in auch
a work ; and whenappropriately introduced,jn connexion
with �ober and argumentative discussion, cannot justly
be condemned.
Indeed there are many topics on which it were idle
to discourse with gravity, even ifit were possible, since
their-intrinsic character_ will irresistibly prompt the rea­
der to-laughter ; and this result will be pi;oduced just in
proportion-to our attempts to restrain it. We may be
excused, th11n, in our notice of the " Humbugs ofNew­
York," if we sometimes. pause to laugh by way ofre­
creation from the sober consideration which we propo1e
-
to give to each of them. · And let no man flatter him­
self that we have him in om: mind's eye, or imagine that
our organ§ of " individuality" and "' locality" make
him the object ofour risibility.. Principia non kominu

Should any reader inquire why we select the city of
New-York as the scene ofour strictures, he may be re­
minded that this is the theatre ofhumh.ugs; the cho1en
arena of itineratiog mountebanks, whether they figure
in philosophy, philanthropy, or religion. Here is found a
motley population, multitudes ofwhom spend their " time
in nothing else, but in searching after some new thing."
Hencethose-who seek to make proselytes to any creed,
however absurd, or to find believers in any pretensions,
however incredible, or miraculous, may gather kindred

spirits here, by " calling them from the vasty deep, and
they will come." The more ignorant, impudent, and
even vicious, such charlatans proclaim themselves to be,
the greater power and patronage they may expect from
the gullible inhabitants oftbis metropolis. And ifthey
can make a pedantic show of learning, lay claims to the
character of philosophers, deal in hyerogtyphics aud
technicalities, and profess supernatural and miraculous
powers, they have only to decry all existing systems,
denounce all the learning of the school!!, condemn and
revile all prevalent opinions on any and· every subject,
and they will find here a great multitude of disciples,
who will eargerly listen to their oracular teachings, and
drink in wisdom and knowledge with the most marvel·
lous credulity. It will be in vain for the guardians of
the public weal, or the conductors of the public press,
or that portion of it which cannot be bribed into silence,
to utter their warnings, or proclaim their opposition ; for
such impostors have only to raise the cry of persecution,
and a tide ofpublic sympathy will rush to their protec­
tion. They need only refer to the cruelties suffered by
Copernicus, when he first proclaimed his astronomical
discoveries, or Harvey, when he introduced his new
doctrine of the circulation of the blood, or they may ·
even compare themselves to Jesus Christ, as though
their persecutions resembled his, m1cl forthwith thou­
sands will rally around their standard, and he ready to
spill their blood in the defence of the nu1hnrs or propa­
gators ofany humbug, however monstrous in philosophy
or morals.
That such a picture of New-York, is that which truth
and candour dernl\nds, does notlessf'n the pain and mor­
tification with wbi'ch it is acknowledged. But Jest any

uld suppose it overdrawn, or at least coloured be­
yond the fact� ofthe' case, it njay be proper here briefly
to allude to a few prominent examples, out of the great
multitude which no man c�n number, which a few years
· have fUrnisheil.
Witness the recent foul and ·horrid blasphemies of
that stupid impo.stor Matthias, and his numerous fol­
lowers. Especially let it be remembered, that he pro­
claimed his owh absolute Divinity, demanded Divine
homage paid to himself, arrogated the name and attri­
butes of the great Jehovah, Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost ; and while proclaiming these stupid and impious
profanities, he found crowds of gaping fools at all his
public meetings; many of them men ofcharacter, wealth,
and influence ; and some, both male and female, who
had always sustained a moral and Christian character,
became his willing disciples, and -committed their wealth,
and even their persons, to his polluted embrace.
Let thisspecimen ofreligious humbug suffice, though
many others little short of Matthias in profanity, by
their past, and even present success in this city, might
be named, iffurther illustration were needed.
'Vitness, again, th.e experiment performed in our midst
a few years since, by Robert Dale Owen, and Fanny
Wright, the latter ofwhom is even now lecturing to thou­
sands, while the party she rallied, is still flourishing on
•
each returning Sabbah, at Tammany-Hall, where hun­
dreds of our youth, of both sexes,- statedly assemble to
desecrate the Sabbath, and listen to tbe·blasphemies of
the Bible, and the God of the Bible, from Fanny's high
priest, an ignorant son of Crispin, who hammers out his
reputation and support upon the lapstone ofpopular cre­
dulity. This, too, is only one instance among many of
infidel humbuggery.

ID relation to philosophical humbugs, an illustrious
uample ia furnished by the ce.lebrated moon story, in­
pnioualy fabricated by a shrewd and intelligent practi·
tiooer on public gullibility, and the success of which
proved, that he had rightly judged of thecharacter ofour
population in regard to their readiness to swallow the
most sublimated nonsense, when dignified by the name
of science. Hundreds of thousands of copies were
quickly disposed of in successive editions ; maps and
drawings, withoutnumber, of the moonaod its wondrous
inhabitants were sold ; and there are very many in our
city, who to the present hour, regard those revelations

established truths in physics or morals.
Io proof that the success of humbug•. is not owing
to the vast proportion of the ignorant and depraved ;
but that the intelligent, enlightened aed respectable por­
tion of the community are equally guillible; a single in·
stance may suffice, from the numerous exhibitions of
quackery in the medical profession, which our city is
perennially ·furnishing. Every body remembers the
celebrated Crawcours, surgeon dentists to Kings,
Queens, and Emperors, who landed here a few years
since from Paris and London. No sooner had their
• flourish of trumpets been heard, and their eavertise­
ments proclaimed their astonishing powers in operating
upon the teeth ofthe old and the young, than·their rooms'
were thronged with the beauty, and fashion, and wealth
of the metropolis. Notwithstandiog our city abounds
with men ofscientific attainment, in the Dental depart·
ment, whose skill and experience have been well known
and established in their profession, yet their modest
merit was postponed to the towering pretensions of tht1
l 1' T R0 D t1 C T 0 :a·y 0 B I II: B V A T I 0 JI I • 21
Crawcours; and every body were crowding to see
them. These stupendous humbugs, finding the ladies
of New-York, whose ·
carriages stood io long array
before their house, to possess so extraordinary gulli­
bility, drained their purses of enorm0us fees ; and i� a
few weeks absconded from the country, bearing with
them· some 20,000 dollars, as the fruit of their prof
es­
sional humbug ; leaving their victims to repentance at
their leisure, for the mischiefs inflicted, many of which
are forevEH" irreparable.
But it were an endless task to enumerate the half of
similar iinffOStures which our city has witnessed ; and if
it were e�en 'done, it would be fruitless. While the
reign of humbug continues, our citizens have neither
eyes nor ear& ; and experience itselfseems tp have been
lost upon them, though bought so dearly. Every year,
and indeed almost every month, .brings to our city some
imported mountebank ; some foreign or dome!lllic hum­
bug ; each ofwhichin its turn is greedilyswallowed while
the rage ofnovelty lasts, until another more clamorous,
or more showy, succeeds it. Meanwhile, however, each
of. these acquires proselytes ; and as fanaticism is con­
stitutional, the same individuals, fo many instances, deli­
berately· swallow them all. Indeed there are gentlemen
and ladies in this city, who have boon successively gul­
led by Matthias, Fanny Wright, the moon story, and
the Crawcours. They have taken the pills offoreign
and domestic quacks by the thousand, with Lobelia,
Cayenne pepper, and vapour baths. They have swal·
lowed Maria Monk, abolitionism, and homreopathia ;
and are now equally busy inbolting down Phrenology and
Animal Magnetism. These several humbugs havingbeen
disposed of, the same persons, and thousands more, will
u 1 1' T B O IH1 C T O ll Y O B a a a Y A T I O ir a .
be prepared fol' still farther experimcatat in gullibility,
ad infinita,..
Let_it not hence be suppoeed, tlaat the city ofNew­
york is the only locality where humbugs douriala and
prevail, much Iese that they originate here. So far
from this being the cue, it will be seen, as we proceed,
that in most cases, the delusions to which reference
will be had, are imported humbugs, which have had
their day, and long since become superanuate, in some
transatlantic.country. And we shall also perceive, that
after the delusion bas passed away, and its impostu�e
been execrated in Europe, some foreign mountebank
has visited our country to renew the experiment here ;
and that not until be has succeeded in making converts
in other and distant places, has be ventured to intro­
. duce it into New-York• . Nevertheless, there are so
many among the population of this city, who are ever
ready to embrace any new dogma, however monstrous
or absurd, provided it be of imported origin, so many _
congenial spirits who greedily devour every foreign
humbug, that soon it becomes natundized here, and
may therefore properly be denominated one among the
" Humbugs of New·York,'' although this city is not
the birth-place of the delusion, nor at all distinguished
by exclusive pretensions to its patronage. In the use
of this appellative, therefore, nothing more is meant
than the fact that these several humbugs receive coun­
tenance and patronage in this great city, as late in the
nineteenth century as the year 1837.
Such, then, are some ofthe reasons whichhaveJed to
the pres�nt·attempt to remonstrate and expostulate with
the citizens of New-York, against the fashion of delu­
sion, the reign of humbug. 1 And the present time bas

been chosen, because ofthe m:>re serious and important
be;mng UPoD the public weal which certain impostures
now rife in our city are likely to exhibit. And as the
" commercial distress under which our country is labour­
ing, .as the result ofhumbuggery on a large scale, baa
paralyzed the public press, and prevented the publica­
tion ofthe usual amount of popular reading, the present
juncture bas been chosen ; if hapily the author shall
succeed in gaining the public eye and ear to a few promi­
nent examples of imPosition upon Popular creduility.
It is the design of this work to examine briefly, but
perspicuously, the nature ofeach ofthe topics selected
for animadversion� as· well as its pretended claims to
truth ; and at the· same time to present the author's un­
disguised and conscientious views of the true cha�acte!
and tendency of each: If he shall succeed in conform­
ing to his purposes, he will " nothing extenuate, or set
down aught in mal�ce." He may err, however, in mat-
, ter and manner ; and he only bespeaks the reader's at­
tention and candour, by which such errors may be de­
tected, and their eff
ort averted. And should he at any
time exceed the bounds of moderation, in his zeal to
satirize reigning delusions, let it be imputed to a san­
guine and ardent temperament, or to a just indignation
against th& stupendous mischiefs which prevalent frauda
are inflicting upon the cause of truth.

in Germany, in the year 17'76 ; although its advocates
vainly allege much greater antiquity, and pretend to
identif
y it with mineral magnetism, with which it can
have neither connexion nor analogy. From the quaint
old story of Faust and
-
the Devil,down to Prince Hohlen­
boe, the Germans have never ceased to invent and pro­
pagate wonders, both in philosophy and religion. But
even among them, Animal Magnetism long since ceased
to receive countenance among the learned, notWithstand-.
ing the multitude of believers which at one time re­
ceived it both among physicians and divines. Fathe�
Hell, a Jesuit of Vienna, seems to have been the origi-

nal proprietor ofthe ihvention, wh�ch he applied to the
treatment of diseases. He employed Antony Mes­
mer, a phy�ieian of those times, to conduct his experi­
ments ; and the latter contrived to identifyhis name with
the subject, by a violent controversy with Father Hell,
and thus the new scienee became generally known un­
der the name of Me81neriam. In the year 1778, Mes­
mer left Germany for the capital ofFrance, where there
is as great a penchant for the supernatural as perhaps
can be found upon the earth ; and in Paris he soon made
the science a source of fame and emolument. Great
numbers of the sick were collected from various and
distant parts of the country upon whorn Mesmer was
reaping immense emolumentR, and ever proclaiming
the most miraculous cures. He made many converts,
even among learned and scientific physicians, who soon
attempted to share the ·spoils with \heir great master.
Among these M. d'Eslon, a member of the Medical
Faculty of Paris, became most conspicuous ; and in
1784, the subject had attracted so 01nch public atten­
tion, that a royal commission was appointed, and also
one from the Academia de Sciences, to investigate the
subject. Of the cbal'tlcter of this commission, and the
weight to which their opinions are entitled, it is only ne­
cessary to record that Bailly, the historian ofAstrono­
my, Lavoisier and Berthollet, the distinguished chem­
ists and philosophers, together with the celebrated
Benjamin Franklin, who was at that time in France,
were among the number; After a patient attention to
public and private experiments for five months succes­
llively, the commissioners reported, that there were " ne>
proof• of the emtence of .8.nimal Magnetinn ; that all
the eff
ects ascribed to it were purely owing to the
3
/
26 O J' A N J H A L M A G 1' B T J ll H •
power ofimaginaliota; the � te imitation naturaJ
to all mankind, aod the mecbanical io.Oueoce oftouching
aAd frictiom on the ""''' 1enailit111 paru of the body ;
and that the practice of it was both lt.urtful a"'1 danger•
oua in 1ociety, Npecially iA a moral point oftiiew." .
But although this learned and able report was, u
might be expected, fatal to the pretensions of Mesmer·
ism, strictly so called, yet the Marquilil de Puysegur,
one of Me1mers followers, now introduced Animal
Magnetism in a ne� and improved form, and pro­
claimed the discovery of Somnambulism, or .Magnetic
1leep. Before his time, convulsiona had been the result
ofthe experiments ; but now somnambulism became the
universal eifect of manipulations. The Marquis, unable
to attend to the multitude of patients who sought sleep
at his hands, determined upon experimenting on a large
scale. He therefore magnetized a tree, from which he
suspended cords, to each of which a patient was at­
tached ; and all being united by their thumbs, he passed
around · among tilem with his mystic rod, and f!Iagne­
tized them by wholesale. " Expect a miracle and it will
happen ; " and accordingly he soon discovered that his
sleeping patients, when in a criiiis, were gifted with s11-
pernatural vision� and this he denominated clainioyanca.
W�ile in this .state, he called them medecina endormia,
sleeping physicians ; because of the wo�derful dis­
coveries in the nature and cure of diseases, in which
they instructed their magnetizer himself. Meanwhile,
other practitioners were producing .the same effects,
by different means ; some of them, like the Chevalier
d� Barbarin, offering prayers at the J.>ed sides ofthe sick,
whic:h prod1,1ced all the phenomena seen under the mag­
DE!tic tree. This new form ef Animal Magnetism .

sptead rapidly over France, Germany, Switzerland,
RWJSia, and Sweden, and continued with the rage of an
epidemic, until 1789, when the French Revolution in·
terrupted, and almost annihilated the science.
Afte� the F�ench war had terminated, the subject
began again to attract attention ; and in Germany as
well as France, it was embraced by many learned and
scientif).c men. Many peri,Odicals were established for
promoting it, and voluminous works on the aubject
were published. In 1813, M. Deltize, published his
History of Animal Magnetism ; and we may judge of
the qualifications of this author, when we learn from
his work, that " the ioay to be con'1incetl oftM exiatence
o
f .11.nimal Magnetiam, ia . to magnetize :" and that we
must_ "forget,f
or the time, aUour knowledge ofphysics,
and metaphysics ;" and he adds, " Do not reaaon f
or
aiz toeeka a
fter you commence the aludy !'' Really, as
has been well remarked, " M. Deluze is very modest !
he only asks a man to resign his reason, imagine an ab-.
surdity, forget his knowledge, commence with credu­
lity, and then promises him that he shall end with
belief! "
Without dwelling farther upon the history of this hum•
bug, it may be sufficient to remark, tbat, in 1826, an­
other royal commission was appointed to examine the
subject anew ; and their experiments were protracted
through a perio� of five years, and although they were
thus patient aQd laborious, they declare in their Report
of 1831, that " the female somnambulist f
ailed in ex­
hibiting any one of the phenomena which the magne·
I
f tizers had pledged themselves to. produce." The com­
mission, nevertheless, seem to have boeo prejudiced
� in favour of the new acieoce ; and their report, therefore1

bas contributed to prolong the 41eluaioo. In the Lon-­
don Foreign Quarterly for October, 1833, will be found
an elaborate review of the whole subject. in which this
Jut French commission receive merited cutigatioo.
In this brief ref
erence to the prominent features in
the history of the " new science" in Europe, it is now
time to make allusion to Perkin's metallic tractors, in­
troduced into England in 1798, and which is believed
to be the chief exhibition of this humbug which ever af
­
flicted Great Britain ; aod indeed, it.is supposed that the
reader is sufficiently familiar with the circumstances at­
tending that imposture, as well as the argumentum ad
hominem, by which Dr. Haygarth annihilated the traer
tors and their author. . In his work, entitled " Of the
imagination, as a cause and cure of disorders, exem­
plified by fictitiow tracrora ; " the reader will find
amuaement in learning that Dr. H. eff
ected exactly the
same cures by painted 1oooden tractors, as Dr. Perkins
had done with his metallic and magnetic ones.
But as this system of Perkinsism was of American
origin, and received for a time, a large share of attention
both at home and abroad, it may be .in place to enlatge
somewhat on the character of Perkins and the form of
Animal Magnetism, by which be and his disciples so
long. humbugged the public. Elisha Perkins, was a na- ·
tive of Cennecticut, and born about 1740. In many
respects he was. an extraordinary man. His habits of
life, as well as his studies, secured to him a very respect-.
able share of general knowledge. He was accustomed
to ride on ftoraeb<M:k for many yeat•a in meceaaion sixty
miles a day, and never made use of stimulating drinks,
()r ardent spirits. He was of a robust and vigorous
constitution ; and it is said that three or f
our hours of ·•
- - - - ---- ---:--
O J' A N I M A L M A G N Jl\ T I S M . 29
rest ·at night, was aH the time be allowed himaelf, or
needed, f
or repose. It is probable froro all we can learn
from .his . history,· that with the exception of the outra.
geous humbug he practiaed up0nthe'public with his "JDe­
taJlic tractors," ',his demeanour and principles bore the
stamp ofbonoar. Professing a belief in Animal. Magnet­
ism as. a powerful agentin curing diseue, he conceived
the idea that for producing an intlueoce upon the nervea
and muscles of animals, by external medical agents� me­
tallic substances were best adapted. After several
years of experiments, he professed to have ditcovered
a composition of metals, out ofwhich be made what he
called his " Tractors." He concealed the compound
pature of the metals, as a mystery unknown to all but
himself. Tht'y consisted ' of two instruments, one of
which had the appeara.nce of steel, and the other of
brass. They were three or more inches in length, and
pointed at one end ; and they were applied for the cure
- ofdisease, by drawing the points over the aff
ected parta
f
rom above downwards, · gently touching the skin for
about twenty minutes a.t each operation. Like all the
other panaceas, they were declared to cure the mo1t
diversified disorders, local intlammations, paina in the
head, teeth, breast, side, back, a,11 well as every form of
rheumatism and neuralgia. He himself published multi·
plied miraculous ewes, and his disciples proclaimed
the like results ; and the enthusiasm created by his vut
pretensions to benevolence .and skill, enlisted the coun�
tenance ofmany ofthe most enlightened men in further·
ance of ail l!Upematural professions. Pamphlet after
pamphlet gave wings to his renown; and the scattered
_partiza11s of Itlesmer, wherever foulld, 1eemed again to
3*

rally underthis new form ofthe old humbug, and Animal
Magnetism became the reigning hobby ofthe times.
In various sections of the American Union, Perkins.
found credulous dupes and de11igning knllves to enter
into hi!! views ; and this city ofNew-York, as might be
naturally inferred, became the scene of som� of his
most conspicuous demonstrations of the sanative po­
tency of his wonderful tractors. There are several
physicians of repute, still among us, who well recollect
the application of his metallic points as the only effect­
ual mean11 of salvation ie cases the most alarming.
Even contagion and infection, tlu>se sturdy agents in
pestilence, were said to be disarmed of their venom, by
the graceful application ofthe tractors to different parts
of the .body, in cases of pestilential fever. What was
proclaimed to be so effectual in private practice could
hardly be looked on with indiff
erence by the distin­
guished and philanthropic men who presided over our
public institutions. Accordingly, Perkiosism found its
way into some of the most important of our public
charities ; and the New-York Hospital, among others,
afforded suitable subjects for the establishment of new
truths by experimental investigation, according to the
true system ofBaconian philosophy. It would be un­
kind and invidious to record the names, or the number
of the physicians ofthat great prac;tical school of med.i�
cine, who employed· these ne·w remedial agents, and
thus lent their influence to the humbug. From the
ample and valuable letter contained in the life of the
late Thomas Eddy, formerly President of that institu­
tion, it may, however, be lawful to mak.e an extract.
Dr.John W. Francis, who has so elaborately drawn the
character ofthis real philanthropist, thus adverts to the I
- -- �-- - --- .

introduction ofPerkinsism among the remedial measures
of the New-York Hospital. The time appeani to have
been about the year 1798.
Speaking of the late Mr. Eddy, Dr. Francis says ;
" I am acquainted with but one striking instance in hi1
whole life, in which the integrity of his judgment was
seriously impugned. He was unwittingly captivated
by the enthusiasm which prevailed concerning the me­
tallic tractors, and was Jed to confide in the remedial in­
fluence of Perkinsism by experiments
.
perf�rmed in th�
New-York Hospital, where that ·practice was counte­
nanced for · a short time by certain physicians of that
charity.'" *
It is foreign from our purpose to enlarge to any ex­
tent on the progress of Perkinsism through Germany
and England. · The reports of the Frederick's Royal
Hospital of Copenhagen, on the efficacy of (he remedy,
were drawn up by Professors Hemholdt and Raf
n ; -
while the report of the remedial potency of the tractora
on the afflicted poor at the Perkinian institution estab·
Jished in London, by the son of the inventor, received
the countenance of a long list of Right Honourables,
.
besides Doctors both of Divinity and Medicine. The
historian oi this extraordinary imposition, states, that
communications of cures were made to the London jn·
stitutioai from almost every quarter of Great Britain ;
and that among the names attached to those veracious
documents, were eight prof
essors, in four differeet t1ni·
versities, twenty-one regular physicians, nineteen 1ur·
geons, and thirty clergymen, twelve of whom were
Doctor• of Divinity, all of whom were outrageou1Iy

humbugged. Their mortification may be imagined,
but not described, when Dr. Haygarth �rodueed similar
proofs of equal success,_ when he used only tooodea
tractor1, painted llO as to deceive the patient into the be­
lief that they were made of the mysterious compound of
metals used by Perkins, and possessing the wonderful
electro-gal"anic-1nagmtic potency. One of the most
distinguished men in Great Britain finally annihilated
the humbug, by operating upon a great number of pa­
tients collected for the purpose, in the presence of the
most distinguished among the professional dupes of the
imposture. All the patients professed to be relieved,
or cured, instantaneously, on the use ofthe tractors ; but
when the operator explained to them. that the pretended
composition metallic tractors, were nothing but two
iron skewers taken from bis kitchen, and appealed to
bis cook who was present, and bad furnished them ; in
the twinkling of an eye, every pain and afBiction re­
turned upon the patients, and all tbe c'tlres he had made
suffered_an instant relapse. The lame resumed their
_ crutches, the blind bad to be led out of the apartment,
and every one ofthe suff
erers became as much afflicted
aa before.
The reader will find much to amuse him on th� sub­
ject of this well-performed comedy in Sir Christopher
Cauatic'spoem, entitled Terrible Tractoration. Whether
the Ametjcan institutions made so formidable a display
of the singular benefits ofthis once popular humbug, we
haveno means ofascertaining. Dr. Francis, with all his
antiquarillD researches, bas left us in the dark as to the
fact, whether the New-York Hospital· published reports
on the subject, either for, or against the success of the
tractors. Some evidence, however, corroborative ofthe
0 1' A N J ll A L ll A G N & T l l ll • 88
lf&V:ing influence of Perkins'• points, in protecting the
American constitution from the shafts of death, must
have been detailed in the volume of caaea, edited by
Be�jamiu Per.kins, the son ofthe inventor:; for it is there
set forth diat no less than one million five hundred thou­
sand patients submitted to their frictionizing agency.
It is a remarkable fact. that Dr. Perkins practised
his impositions upon th� public with so much success,
that he seems ultimately to have swallowed his own
humbug. For this daring empiric wishing to prcwe the
universal potency of his tractors, had the hardihood to
apply them in person to the sick, during the yellow f
ever
in New-York, in 1799 ; and while thus employed, he
himself contracted the epidemic ; and notwithstanding
the imaginary efficacy of his tractors, which wer� faith­
fully tried, he fell a victim to the disease. Like Para­
celsus, the prince and father of quacks, his boasted
catholicoo was of no utility to himself.
Having thus glanced at the more remote history of
Animal Magnetism, and indicated- the variety of modi­
ficatioms the subject has received .in different countries,
we may now come down to our own times, and confine
our_observations to that form of this old imposture which
it is believed no where finds fuour or countenance, ex­
cept in the_ United States, at the present hour. For
although Me11mer and Perkins are dead, and their ex­
periments on public gullibility are no longer repeated,
yet, as we shall presently see, equally ridiculous and
absurd dogmas on the subject, find popularity and
anccesa.
The recent introduction of this humbug into the Uni­
ted States, ao4 its pre!ent success in this country may
therefore next claim our attention. It is but lately that
84 O P .l Jl' J M .l L M A. G IUI T J B M ,
a German Journal of Magnetism complained that
Great Britain and America presented a tabula raaa in
regard to every thing connected with Animal Magnetism.
The reason is obvious why such was the fact. We
have had our witches, and prophets, and miracle-mon­
gers, and Perkins among them, but their wonders hue
ceased, and we had thought tbat their history bad been
written together with their epitaph. Nevertheless, our
German reviewer need complain no longer, so far as
America is concerned, for recent events have shown
that this ancient humbug is destined to spread through
the land with the rapidity of a contagious fever, sweep­
ing before it the last vestige of common sense from ita
multiplied victims. It is fit therefore that an .attempt
to remonstrate against its desolating mischief
s should
be made, however unsuccessful such eff
ort may be, by
reason of the array of great names, by which the delu·
sion is obtruded upon the public attention. Such re­
monstrance may, at least, serve to protect the ri11ing
generation from the infatuation ; for the history of the
times should at least show posterity, that there were
some who strove to arrest its progress, and demonstrate
its falsity.
Very little has been said or thought of Animal Mag�
netism in the United States since the time of Perkin1,
until within the last two yea.rs ; and perhaps Dr. Brig­
ham, the recent correspondent of Colonel W. L. Stone,
in bis unfortunate pamphlet, gave the first impulse to
the subject here in his book entitled " Influence of
Religion upon Health," in which he introduces the
subject as explaining every thing " supernatural " in re­
ligion ; and accounts for the phenomena of revivals, and
the eff
ect of the preaching of eloquent minist�s, aa well

as what is denominated spirituality in religiou11 experi·
ence, on the principles of Animal · Magnetism. How
far this book. has been circulated, and lo what �xtent it
has been instrumental in preparing the �blic mind for
the reception of this humbug, cannot accurately be
affirmed. But it is certain that it wu not long after its
publication at Hartford and Boston, before M. Poyen,
a French Professor ofAnimal Magnetism, began to find
f
avo ur among the people " down east." He commenced
his public lectures duririg the winter of 1836 -'7 ; and
having found a girl who was simpleton .enough to favour
bis designs, by becoming · his som!lambulist, he visited
Boston and other places, and to ihe present hour is
itinerating with one or more " sleeping beauties " who
are trained for the purpoae, and by whom · multitudes
have been gulled into a belief in the " new . science."
At Providence, he seems to have gained over the fac.
ulties flf physic� and divinity ; and by tbes� the poor
factory girls have been taught an easier and more pro­
ductive .employment than that of attendiag upon their
spinnin� jennies. Still, however, the whole farce has
been laughed at by people of sense who have not been
brought within .the charmed circle, and magnetized out
Gf their brains, until very lately. A number of third
rate doctors,
·
merchants and m�chanics, having failed in
their appropriate employments to r.ealize either f
ame or
emolument, have become co�verts to the opinion that
" the world is a great goose, and every man a fool who
does not pluck its quills." Accor<}iogly, providing
themselves each with a factory girl, who would ratlur •
1leep than work, they have scattered themselves abroad
iq the villages, towns, and cities 'Of the land ; at first
giving priva� ex�riments for the purpo•.• ofteatisig the
86 O J' A. K U I A. L JI A. G K l\ Tl l lll •
gullibility of the inhabitants, and then inriting the publio
to witneu the phenomena, at the modest fee of one
dollar for each visiter.
Next to Providence, R. I., these itinerating mounte­
banks and their misses, have been most successful in
Schenectady, New-York, where the President and Fac­
ulty of Union College seem to have swalfowed the
humbug whole, some of whom have committed them­
selves in writing, as it is said, by introducing the opera­
tors, and endorsing thei.r pri!tensions. It is rumored
that one of the students submitted to the magnetizer'a
manipulations and feigned somnambulism, for the pur.
pose of undeceiving his preceptors, and having gulled
all parties, afterwards confessed his duplicity and the
laudable motive of it. But for this, it is certain, that­
the inhabitants of that place had hi!en overwhelmed
with the humbug. Since then, however, an attempt baa
been made to redeem the college from this silly conceit,
by one of the graduating clasM, who delivered a satire
upon the whole concern on Commencement day, which
was creditable to his head and heart. It is, therefore,
ardently to be hoped, and it is f
air to presume, that
those excellent men who were for a time decieved by
this new form of jugglery, have renounced the snare
and are themselves again. The city of New-York,
filled as it is with fanaticism, had not yet been visited- ·
by this species of imposture. Its propagators and ad­
mirers w�re aff!lid to trust themselves in this metropolis
with their factory girls, until they had secured among
the victims of magnetic influence some of the public
men who should vouch for their pretensions.

ofthe late "Exposition, Theory, and Key ;" the mag·
netizers had well nigh despaired of gaining ingress into
N ew-York, until Col. . Wm. L. Stone, the editor of the
Commercial Advertiser, being on a visit to Providence,
R. I., was invited to witness the experiments of Dr.
Capron upon a Miss· Bracket of that city. This in­
telligent and honourable man, for such he is in the es­
timation of all who know him well, by reason of the
organ of " benevolence," of which he has a singular de­
velopement, is predisposed to give his confidence to the
integrity of all with whom he meets, in any circle in which
be allows himself to move. Like many other excellent
men, he is unsuspicioul!I, and will .repel any thought
which would impugn the honesty of others, until the
evidence of a forfeiture of his courteay is fully apparent.
And having conducted a series of experiments in whjch
he could perceive no collusion or mistake, unless he
consented to harbour a suspicion that one of the parties
was a knav� he could not consent to this latter alterna­
tive, and therefore was beguiled by the former. It is,
therefore, plainly unjust to accuse Col. Stone of a defi·
ciency of intelligence, much less to question bis in­
tegrity, as some have incautiously done ; since bis error
only consisted in bis refusihg to admii the possibility or
deception, on the part of his sleeping girl. In the first
place, she pretended to be blind ; and the Colonel was
. too gallant to dou"bt her veracity, e1pecially as Dr. C.
confirmed the statement by his ·professional opinion ; in
which it is f
air to presume· that he confided implicitly
in her word ; for who should know so well tha,t she was
blind as the girl herself! Nea:t, in reply to the question
candidly put to herself, whether she was sound a.tleep 'I
she solemnly answered audibly in the affirmative, and

llaiting the aetion !o the wordt her ey� were cleeed,
and her limbs relased aa though. in a quiet alUmlMr.
But nili more,· she was not only bliad and akep, but
lhe- waa al10 cleclared to be ao au.f, .that " a park of
artillery could . not wake her,'' always excepting that
her ears were " opea as melting charity," to Iler mag­
netizer ; but she ever and anon heraelf affirmed, that
she could bear nobody but Dr. Capron, unless some one
else Wal placed in magnetic communication ·with her.
And in addition to her \leing deaf, asleep, and blind, her
eyes were stuffed with cotton wadding• under ber green
speotaoles, for the sensibility of her eyes to the light was
most exquisite. It was in charity, therefore, to her optic
nerves, while blind and asleep, that her eyes were thus
Mind.folded. It was not necessary, however, to burden
her with ke&tty �andages, much· less to fit the bandage
1'ery accurately to prevent her seeing, for she was blind
any how ! At Jeast so sh" said, and it would not answer
· t�eontradict her, for she was represented to be both " re·
apectable and pious !" The Doctor and the gentlemen
from whom the Colonel received his information, were
doubtless highly respectallle gentlemen, and worthy of
all confidence, so far.astheir personal yeracity wascon­
cemed ; butitnever entered into the Col'onel's mind, that
tltese- gentlemen were gulled by this " respectable and
pious girl ;" and hence · the- Hurce of .his delusion.
Hence he believed that she had .. vision without the
visual ·organs ;" and being " favourably impressed .in her
behalf," by the " delicate - mind and manners of this
modest·and diffident blind·young lady," it _was perfectly
natural that he -should be prepared for. imposition on a

of.New-York,�ho llad alwa.ys,oonfided in the sapeity ef
its author, were·trulyaetounded. Tbe eubjeetsoon be­
came noised abroad ; for although he did not :profeee
· himself to be a full believer, yet his nurative was ac­
companied by so many evidences, that be confided in
her miracles·;· and thMe are told with so much gravity,
that every.readeris eonskainedto tefJald the .Colonel BB
a convert to .the new science.
It would be euy to show by extracts from this pamph·
let, that while in contact with the magnetizer, and this
sleeping beauty of Providence,·the Colonel was himself
magnetized out of his usual self-possession. . . But a few
example& only. will be named, si�ce it is no part of our
d�n to deal cenaoriously with the · pamphlet or .its
author.
The Colonel invites Miss B., during magnetic slum·
. her, to visit New-York with him ; and. on page 19, we
learn that he inquired both of herself and friends w�er
she had ever been in New-York, and was assured that
she· had not. Now the motive of the inquiry and the
object of recording it, are doubtl�H to convey the idea
that she was ignorant of the_. localities of this city, and
that therefore whatever she should now describe WQuld
be by clairv°'ance or supernatural vision. �et, moat
strangely, we are infonned by the Colonel, OD page 14,
that:at least " one gentleman had taken her to New­
york, aud placed her in the Park, and conducted her to
auridry otherplace1 some time since." And kow often she
had been thus taken, in the t1ery route he was about to con­
duct her; and what familiarity she. had thus acquired with
the " Park and sundry other plaees,'l seems not to have
oocorred to him as worthy of.inquiry. It ia in vai?w aay
40 0 1' A N l K A L ll A G ll' & T U .M .
that ahe had never been in New-York in her bodily pres­
ence, but only in imagination, while in magnetic sleep,
aince a knowledge oflocalities and particularly of liona I
could be as readily obtained in that way as in propna
peraona, if·sbe always bad as communicative a compan­
ion. Nor will it do to allege that she forgets all she
·aees and bears during her magnetic slumber, and ia
afterwards unconscious of every thing that bas passed ;
for Colonel S. assures us, that she did remember, after
ahe had been awaked from her sleep, and related to Dr.
C. many things she saw during her somnambulatory in­
terview with him, and which she had refused to commu­
nicate at the time. ·
Another singular example ofthe strange infatuation of
all within the magic circle, is seen in the Colonel's
gravely informing his readers that Miss B. cannot hear
any person when in the magnetic state, but the person or
persons with whom the magnetizer bas willed that she
ahould be in communication. Nor can she hear ev�n
them, unless they direct their speech to herself. " He
must speak . to her, or she bears him not, and only
wonders why /iii lipa mof!e ! and yet that he does not
speak." How strange, that this blind lady, asleep, and
with her eyelids closely shut, and bandaged with cotton
waddings, can, nevertheless, se1t through her green
1pectacles, whether the lips move I So singular is the
effect ofmagnetism upon all present, that the manuscript
recording it, is approved by literary friends in Providence,
who were present at the humbug, and swallowed it
whole.
· .It can scarcely be necessary to remind any reader of
Colonel Stone's pamphlet of the palpable fact, that his
questioDS were leading in their character, almost witJi.;

feature in the experiments is so obvioU11, that all who
have looked into the pamphlet, must have remarked it
with . surprise. And accordingly, no one seem• to be
amazed at any of the marvels relat�d, until some of the
pietures in Colonel Stone's house, are represented to
have been described 10 minutely. At these " m•t
wenderful " and astounding replies, the reader cannot
fail·to be petrified with astonishment, after reading the
declaration, on the 37th page, that of these " principal
tests, not a soul in the room, as I believe, had any pre.
vious knowledge but myself." But the miracle will be
len miraculous, when turning io tho 4lst page of the
same narrative, we find Dr. C. sayiJig to Mias B.,
" When Mr. Stone was in Pro'fidence, a few days llince,
he apoke to me of some pictures, which be prizes highly,
did you see any.of them 1" On the presumption on
which· both the Doctor and th& Colonel were acting,
that she was "asleep and . blind and deaf," either· of
them might have spoken:ofthe pictures, and one of them,
doubtless, had done so in her presence. It may have
been done unconsciously, and would have been perfectly
18f
e and honest, ifshe was in magnetic sleep, at the
time ; in view of their assurance ofher incapacity to see
and hear, under aucb circumstaneea ; and it would be
4•
f2 OJ' .A N l lllU. L H .A G N & T I S Jl 9
perf
ectly natural for them to forget the circumstance
afterwards, because of its unimportanee. That this is
the key to the_wonderful discoveries ofthe pictures, doea
not admit of a rational doubt.
.
What must have been the mystification of the Colonel,
at the time be recorded alld published these proof
s, that
he was himself " outrageously humbugged,"· is as great
a mystery to his friends, as is Animal Magnetiam un•
explained, And yet, of his sincerity in narrating the
fact• in the case, aa well as hia purpose to avoid and
detect any imposture or fraud in the experiments,. no
en& can doubt. He seems, hewe'1er, to have anticipa­
ted, as he approached the close of his narrative,. that he
wu making himself a -target for thousands of arrows,
and with astonishing self-complacency, writes the epi·
taph of all who may assail him, by denominating them
in advance as " witlinga and bi-isk fool#." This may
have been expected to disarm or intimidate criticism ;
but the. subject is too important in its bearings, and the
evidences ofits fAllacy too apparent to escape with im­
punity, even at the hazsrd of incurring his displeasure�
or suffering from the application of his hard names.
Nevertheless, while condemning: and reprobating the
imposture, we are earefully to separate men's persons
iTom their errors ; and·eitpecialiy when, as in the present
case, the plausibility of the sophisms by which he has
been imposed upon is so great, and the easy and natural
process by wbicb he has been practised upon. is sa
readily admitted.
The .error ofColonel .Stone consists, .first, in his con�
fiding too implicitly in the truth and honesty of the
" blind young lady,'' and in the impossibility of ltiarned·
doctors ancl divines being gulled by an ingenious femalo.
----�-

practitioner of a profitable humbug. But a still greater
error is that of lending his name and infiuence to sustain /
the pretensions of the humbug, instead of contenting
himself, as he should, in relating what be saw and beard,
without committing himself to the pseudo-philosophy by
which it was explained. It would have been easy to
state aU his experiments and conversatjons with Miss B.,
and·explain the nature of the theory by which the advo­
cates of the new science account for these mysteries,
while, in the absence of all evidence, be should have
left the public to judge whether their theory was true or
f
alse. The exposure of the imposture, by which If)
many have been the dupes, would then in no wise have
wounded either his feelings or his reputation.
The worthy Colonel may not thank any one for the
exposition of the process by which he bas been gulled,
notwith3tanding the kindness ofthe motive which prompts
it. Still it is but justice to urge in his defence that be
has been beguiled, by the craft ofhis convenient corres­
pondent, into the position wbieh otherwise he might have
avoided ; and but for this it is searcely credible that he
would have taken it. In the letter of Dr. R to which
the Colonel replies, it will be perceived that the doctor
calls the phenomena " incredible ;" and &dds that " an
immensity ofproof appears to be necessary in order to
establish things so extraordinary, and so contrary to the
common sense and ro the testimony of all times ;" and·be
most craftily calls Animal Magnetism a " new art, sci­
ence, or imposture,'' as though: he was a perf
ect novice
in the subject, and bad been taking lessons in non­
eommittalism. · The public, however, need hardly be
reminded, that this innocent doctor being bimselfwofully
eommitted by his publication a few months before, in
44 O JI' .A. N I X A L lll ..l G N & T l 8 11 .
which he had taught this " art, science, or imposture,"
and urged it as furnishing aa explanation of all that ia
miraculous, mysterious or aupematural in religion, bacl
hence the strongest motive• to enlist a prof
essor of
Christianity in the snare. Hence hi» letter is carefully
and skilfully adapted to call out all the Colonel'•
strength to sustain the humbug, while be flatters him
with the reminiscence that " Animal Magnetism has at.
tracted the attention of many of the moat 1cienti.fic men
in Europe." So far from being the noviciate and unbe­
liever his letter would indicate, Dr. B., during his visit
- to the countries where it prevailed, had opportunities
for acquainting himself with the subject enjoyed by few ;
and having become an admirer of the " art, science, or
imposture," of -which he had been -the dape, as his wri­
tings prove, he had omnipotent reasons f
or securiBg so
valuable an auxiliary. Hence Dr. Capron is not the
only magnetizer of -whose infatuation tl�e Colonel has
been the victim.
It is now time to inform the reader that since the
wonderful experimeo.ts of Colonel Stone have been
published, Mr. C. F. Durant has iSsued a work, to
which allusion bas already been made, in which he hH
fully established the fact that this Miss Bracket is noC
blind if she was ever so ; and tlmt the miraculous " vision
without visual organs," which the Colonel bas celebra­
ted, is therefore altogether a humbug. She herself told
Mr. D. that her sight was so far recovered -lhat she could
diattnguiak ob
jecta very well, and proved it by examining
his whiskers when awake ! He also proved -that while
in magnetic sleep, she was not dea
fas is pretended ; for
on.clapping bis bands together near her ear, she started
suddenly andjerked her bead eight or ten inches, And
- -- --------------:� ----- -
O F A. N I M A. L M A. G N E T l 8 H • ,5
by this experiment he fully proved not only that she wu
not deaf but that she was not asleep, though pretending
to be so. He also proved that she did not " aee toil!&
the back of her h.ead ;" for he opened a knife and stand­
ing behind her, thrust it at her head, so that the persons
in the room involuntarily shuddered, while she did not
move a muscle. I.le also ascertained that she had th•
cotton waddings under her spectacles so arranged that
she could see objects distinctly under them when placed
on the left temple, and that they were inv1Uiably placed
there before being carried to the back of her head for
inspection.
The zeal of Mr. D. in exposing this humbug is
worthy of all praise, whatever may be thought of the
means he employed to detect it, or the causticity of
manner in which he has made the exposure. But a.I-
. though this last is much talked of by the sect, yet the
truths his work contains are, after all, by far the ·greatest
specimens of severity in the book. He employed seve­
ral weeks in visiting the various magnetizers and their
" sleeping beauties," in diff
erent parts of the country1
and conducted a series of amusing experiments upon
each, all the while professing a belief 1n their miracles,
and thus securing their confidence. The reader will
find his book both entertaining and instructive ; exhibit­
ing as it does the most astonishing trickery, and the
most consummate knavery, on the part of the " factory
girls," who are the chief somnambulists in the country,
and likewise the most extraordinary instances of gulli:
bility and " outrageous humbuggery " which this world
has ever witnessed.
.
It ought to serve as a perpetual
antidote against public credulity and popular delusion.
Soon after the publicity which
,
the Colonel's pamphlet
48 O JI' A Ji l H A L M .A. O ft & T I B lll ·
gaye ·to the humbug, a number of the prof
esBOtS and
their sleepiug beauties were successively brought to this
city ; among wboin were Messrs. Potter and Grant, with
a Mi83 Ayres, as their somnambulist, and the celebrated
Mr. Andros, and his wife ; the latter of whom was re­
ported to be an extraordinarily good subject, and as
having astonished the natives down east by her clairvoy­
ance. The public invitations which were given in the
newspapers on behalf of each of these parties, were
responded to by Vei'Y many of our citizens, each of
whom werti charged one dollar, for witnessing the ex­
periments. Two public exhibitions were ordinarily
given each day ; but for the accommodation of private
parties, the accommodating ladies would go to sleep at
any hour, and any number of times in the day, for · a
suitable fee. Many of the ladies and gentlemen w]io
visited Mies .Ayres, beeame sturdy believers, although
there were palpable evidences at each experiment that
she was " wide awake," during her feigned somnambu·
lism, and notwithstanding-her almost uniform f
ailure to
" guess " the answer that was expected from her. Her
eyelids quivered inceBSantly as do those of any body
else who purposely keep the eyes shut in the midst o(
� strong light, and is an infallible test by which feigned
sleep ,may be detected. · Another equally palpable eYi­
deru:e that she was awake, was presented in the per­
petual rolling of the eyeballs, which was visible through
the eyelids when closed, and uniformly in the direction
of the operator, or experimenter, and in that of the
· objects which she pretended to examine by clair1Joy11nce.
An� when she was made to open the eyes, the pupils
contracted and dilated with the increase or diminution
of. the light, and she gave other evidences of perf
ect

and- voluntary vision. AH the while she profe88ed to
ha unable to see or hear, except when magnetically
co�ected with some . one _by the command of her
magnetizer.
The experiments in which Miss Ayres was instructed
are chiefly those of accompanying her interrogator in
im11gination, to his house, or to some distant place ; and
for tb,e most part she contented herself with answering
his queations. It was in this department that she was
aaid to- have made many successful hits. If she did, it
must have been when ·we were not there to see ; for, in
several attempts we were lucky enough to witness, al·
though .she guessed with all her might, she was very
unlucky. Indeed she never, in a single instance, saw
any thing in our presence, but through her ears, when
her examiner kd her a la mode Colonel Stone. She
did not attempt to read any thing, though she frequendy
tried to tell the time, by watches placed to her stomach,
whenshe was blindfolded ; but she uniform!y failed ; and
her convenient magnetizer, as uniformly, attributed it to
her being fatigued or indisposed. On one occasion,
when some of the visiters manifested great indignation
at the hoax which Mr. G.-ant and Miss Ayres were play­
iDg upon them, after taking their dollars, while the latter
continued to sleep on, though every experiment was a
fail11Te, the former proposed to prove that she was
asleep and blind, and offered the following proposition
as a tea�. " I will take this_pencil," said be, " and drop
· it into her. hand, and she shall mistake it for any .article
which one of the company may name." One o� the
gentlemea silently wrote on a pit\ce of paper " let her
miatab it for a wafofbread." Mr. G. , placing himself
before his somnambulist, then commenced the following
•8 0 ., .A. !'f U U . L 11 .l G N & T I S lll .
dialogue, which is related with the results, that the read­
er may have this decisive experiment fully before him.
Mr. G• ..,... Mary, are you sound asleep 1
- .am. - Tes, Sir.
Mr. G. - Do you see plain 1
.ana. - Yes, Sir.
Mr. G. - Hold out your hand. -
She obeyed.
Mr. G. - Tbe other band.
She obeyed.
Mr. G. - Now tell me what this is, (dropping the
pencil into her open hands,) be very particular.
Mr. G. now looked intently with a mysterious frown
at Miss A., and willed with all his might, that she should
call it a loaf ofbread. In a few minutes she exclaimed,
Ob yes ! it is a 1Dater-meron. At which the company
laughed, and Mr. Grant bid her smell it and taste it, for
the was mistaken. She guessed again, a " big apple,"
a potatoe, &c., until Mr. G. acknowledged it waa a
failure. He next held a knife in his closed hand, and
bid her tell him what it was, she said " a key." Next
be held a key, and on inquiry, she answered " a knife ; "
and so on until her guessing disgusted the company,
and most ofthem retired abruptly. Thus ended the ex­
periment, which was to prove that she was -!lSleep, and
blind, but evidently to his deep mortification. It wu
the prevalent and most charitable opinion that he was
hoaxed by his fair cousin, although some were cruel
enough to charge him with collusion, yet on no other
-
authority than surmise. The utter failure to do any
thing. she attempted in our presence, seemed to aff
ord
proof that there was no collusion or fraud on his part ;
for if so, either he or bia conf
ederate, were wofully

deficient in the leBSon. , People were befooled out ot
their money, however, and that was enough. But still
' worse, there were many bef
ooled out of their brains ; al­
though, doubtless, many among the visiters �id their
money for the purpose of witnessing a hl.lmbug, k,!low­
ing it to be »uch, and were content with grati'fying their
curiosity by learning a rie.w method by which women aa
· well as men were contrivi,ng to live without work.
Mrs. Andros, who attracted a much larger shar� of
attention, and realized much more money than her pre­
decessor, is, in many respects, an extraordinary woman.
She goes to sleep at her husband's bidding, with most
l\miable compl�cency. She seats herself in her rocking
chair, when the hours of exhibition arrive ; and on Mr•
.A. looking intently into her eyes for the space of only
two <>r three minutes, her eyes close, her head falls,
and she appears locked in the arms of Morpheus. Now
he lovingly lays hit;1 hand upon her head, antl passes
his hands gently over her body and limbs; and by these
manipulations, secures protracted somnambulism. Now
she is prepared to be magnetically connected with any
of the spectators ; and in answer to his questions and·
wi�hes, she will discourse of things however distant in
time or space. Her inagnefizer relates some of the
wonders of her clairvoyance whi�h be has witnessed, by
her having told a gentleman " that his house.. was built
of brick, that it had a front door, that there was a
tabte and two chairs in the. hall, a carpet on the ·floor ;"
and on being asked if she saw any thing else, she dis­
covered a lamp, a back-door, or a staircase, with divers
other similar wonders. The visiters are urged 11> take
her in imaginationto their houses ; and one after another

formed. At one of the private e;,xbibitions, with a few
friends, it was .greed· to put her claims to a deciaive
teat. A. small image was taken from the mantle-piece

the inf
atuated dupes whe 11wallow the humbug; are a
proof that there is no fraud, else ahe would invariably
suc�eed. This Mrs. Andros is the lady with whom ·
many of Mr. Durant's most ludicrous experiments weN
perf&rmed ; and it was she who, during somnuibuliem,
when she p�of

The philosophy of this whole matter, by thu time,
must be plain to the reader. If all the •pectators'are

Such instances, and many more equally palpable; were
witnessed by many, during the reign of the humbug in
this city ; nor can it be doubted, that wherever any of the
wonders spoken of have been exhibited, similar infatua­
tion on the part of those who certify to tlrem, is the
secret of their delusion. That they do hear every word
that passes between those around them, during the pre·
tended somnambulism, wa� proved in the presence of
many of us beyond the possibility of mistak&. And the
reader of Mr. Durant's book, witt perceiye that be liaa
fully established this fact, and availed himself of the
knowledge of itto practise UP911 them flagrant deceptiou,
and extort from them the precise answers which he pre­
dicted, in defiance ofthe will of the magoetizer put forth
to prevent it.
It is in vain to allege that Messrs. Potter, Grant,_and
Andros, are not skilful magnetizers, or that Miss Ayres
or Mrs. Andros are not good somnambulists ; for many
· who have seen them all, give the f
ormer the preference
over Dr. Capron, or M. Poyen himself; and the superi­
ority of these ·ladies to the renowned Miss Bracket, is
shown by the accumulated evidence contained in Mr.
Durant's " key," to which the reader is referred for
· ample evidence. Animal Magnetism, then, we may
now surely hope, has had Its day ; for one can scarcely

imagine it pouible, henceforth, that uy can have the
hardihood to practiae it ; and ifthey do, the age ofbum-:
bug will indeed be the appropriateepithet (
or the present
generation, should any body be hereafter deceived by iUI
absurd and f
allacious pretensions. It is fit that the
victims of this delusion should be treated with kindOON
and forbearance ; and that, be11ceforth, they aed the
world, should be taught the necessary and important
lesson, that he or she who pretends to &Upenlatural and
miraculous powers, whether planted upon the ramparts
of philosophy, or enthroned upon the semblance of re­
ligion itself, is ueifonnly 8ftd infallibly either • kntwe or
afool.
It bas been already noticed, that in the report of the
commissioners appointed by the French Academy, in
178', of whom the celebrated Dr. Franklin WH one.
Animal Magnetism, thus early in its biatory, bad become
" hurtful and dangerous to society, especiaHy in a maraJ
point of view." For, although die existence .ofAnimal
Magnetism was denied, yet the com.missioners witaMs­
ed enough to convince them ofthe extraordinary ef&eUI
which artifice and imposture may produc� on enf
eebled
intellects and over-heated imaginations. They there­
fore felt it their duty to addreu a private memoir to the
king, aettiag forth the serious ifljury to public mora'6,
consequent upon its employment as a ·remedial egeat.
They ref
erred to the physician, at whose instance the
commission had been appointed, H. D•Eslon himself,
u admitting that '"a woman in a high etate ofmagnetic
ucitement, wu not mistress of her own actions, &nd
was incapable ofreeisting any attempts on her moduty."
In Mr. Russel"& tour in Germany, will be found the
lallowing melancholy_ e'Vidence, that the practice called
6*

Animal Magnetism, has lost none of its demoralizing
tendencies.
·
" A melancholy instance of the pernicious results to.
which this may lead, was still the subject of general
conversation when I arrived at Berlin. The principal
actor in the aff
air was Dr. W --, the great apostle of
the doctrine in Prussia, and moreover a prof
essor in the
University. The unfortunate v.ictim was a young lady
of very respectable family. She had been led by curi­
os�y to visit I.he apartments. in which the doctor per�
forms the magnetical process on a number of patients�
in presence of each other ; and it is at once a very de­
cisive and intelligible fact, in that science, that females
are found to be the most suitable subjects for its ex­
ercise."
Several experiments, which it is unne.cessary to re­
peat, were gone through for her satisfaction.
" The lady departed, still in deubt ; but these amusing
scenes had so far shaken her original skepticism, that
the magician easily prevailed upon her to arrive at cer­
tainty, by having the truth displayed in. her own person.
* * * �
" To the poor girl conviction and ruin came together ;
a miscreant could find little difficulty in abwiing the
mental imbecili.ty which must always accompany sqch
voluptuous fa'(latieism. I cannot enter into the details
of the miserable and disgusting circumstances which
followed. Excess of villainy brought the whole aff
air,
before a court ofjustice and the Prussian public. It was
clear that what was to becoine the liviog witness of their
guilt had met with foul play ; and the enraged father pre-.
ferred against -the prof�ssor an accusation of a crime
which is ne&t to murder, or rather which threatened �
- - - -- --- - -
..
double murder. The judges ordered the recipes of-cer­
tain medicines which the doctor bad adm
,
inistered to the
lady, to be submitted to three medical gentlemen for
their opinion. The report of these gentlemen rendered
it impossible to convict Dr� W -- of having used the
.drugs directly for his infamous purpose ; but, as in cer­
tain circumstances, their indirect operation would lead
to the same issue, the professional persons gave it as
their opinion that the professor was bound to explain on
what gro1mds he had administered medicines of a most
suspicious class, in circumstances where no prudent
medical man- would have prescribed them. · The man
did not choose to do himself this justice ; the court did
not think there was sufficient evidence to convict him of
the direct charges. Professor W - has lost his cha­
racter, but retains his chair/' -Vol. i., p. 102.
Mr. Durant's late book gives soine hints on this as­
pect of the subject, which prove that these experiments
in somnambulism, fictitious as he has proved the pre­
tended phenomena to be, not only stamp the whole
science with the character of humbug, but are alike cal­
culated to brand it with infamy.
Finally, it ought to be distinctly remembered that
whatever may be the apparent mysteries, which have
deluded any of those respectable men who have unwit.­
tiogly given their names· to this humbug, as exhibited in
New
-York and at Providence, that Mr. Durant has con­
clusively proven by numerous unequivocal tests, that
Miss Brar.ket is not blind ; and · that neither she, nor
Mrs. Andros, nor Miss Ayres, nor any one of' the som­
nambvlists who have become celebrated in those places,
were asleep during their alleged somnambulism. He
tlpplied hia tests to them indiv�ually, and in a variety of
66 o r .l N l llC .l L M .l G M • T l l M .
ways. It ie also established by his experiment& that
these women all magnetize tbem1elYes ; that is, they go
to sleep and they wake again preeieely at the times
wmeb they lltiM the magoetizer intends they abould ;
and when they misunderstand his -111ill, or are p\H'J)OIMlly
deeeiVed in relation to it, they disappOint hie expecta­
tioas. He has also proyed that the bandages on their
eyes do not prevent sight, eapecially if the object be
placed at the epigutrium, u most of them requires ; and
that when objects are seen at all they are invariably
brought within the range ofviaioo before they are placed
at the pretended seat of sight, and that whea this ia pre­
vented, the experiment is always a failure. The pro­
cess by which pictures are examined, and other objecte,
at a distance, be bas shown is by means of their ears.
when they pretend to be deaf, and the parties are oW
their guard. And be thinks be has established the f
act,
that the girls are unif
ormly .the koavea io the humbug,
and the magneuzers aa constantly are gulled. The fact
of the concerted signals he sometimes detected, how­
ever, seem to show that in 1101De cases there was palpa­
ble collusion.
As to these and all other alleged proofs of clai"oy­
ance, and especially the succeu of somnambulisbJ, in
detecting and describing diseases and their treatment,
it· may be sufficient to refer to the report of the recent
French commissioners, heretofore alluded to, where
these cases are all explained to be uniformly WJ'Olll•
unleH when their urs have been the medium of infor­
mation, while seeming to be asleep and deaf, as in the
cue of the pictures, &c., before mentiened.
In this famous repert of which MT. Colquhoun hat
made a voluminous work, it is but fair to atate. that the1
- - - - - - - - - - - - - . ·

67
made a report on the'who.le favourable to the humbug ;
although the precious confessions it contains, annihi­
late the validity of their eases, as they were extorted
f
rom men evidently prejudiced ii) its favour. This will
appear obvious in the sequel. For after numerous ex- .
periments conducted by 1\1. Foissae, at whose impor­
tunity they had been commissioned, they declare that ·
" the -somnambulist failed in exhibitiqg any one of the
phenomena which he had pledged himself to produce ;"
aod straightway they attribute this total failure· to their
oum " inexperience and incredulity," and by conse­
quence. intimate, that had they been as gullible as the
magnetizer, they might ha\'e reported diff
erently. Next
we find them conducting experiments io. which the aom­
nambulist resided in the houses ofthe magnetizera thcm­
aelvu; and then to prevent the natural impression of
conspiracy, they gravely tell us that. they " guarded
against the possibility of any other collusion than that
which might exist between tbe magnetizer and hia pa­
tient." This is the only collusion tbat any body sus­
pected, and yet they did not guard_against thiS, because
it would imply suspicion against the integrity of the par­
ties which would have .been uncourteous. And never·
tbeless, they were afterwards obliged to. record tlleir
- conviction, that " somnambulism itself may be feigned,
and furnish to quackery the means ofdeception."
These commisione.rs the11 proceed to classif
y the
·cases according to the " more or less· conspicuou� de­
gree of the magnetic action recognized in each." The
classes thus formed, including all the cases they saw
during the period of six years, are the following :
" I.. Magnetism has no e
ffect upon persons in a state
of sound health, nor upon some diseased persons.
II. Io others, its eff
ects are alight.
58 O P .& l U ll A L X .A. 0 1' 11: T U ll .
III. These eft"
ects are produced sometimes by en­
. nui; by tllOftOlotty, by the ir.aginatiott.
IV. We have seen them developed independently of
these last causes, ·mo1tprobably aa the eff
ect of magnet·
ilm alone.
Of the fint three classes we need not here speak,
f
or to talk of " magnetic eff
ects, " in cases in which by
their own concession it has " no effect," as in the first
class, or " 1ligl&t" eff
ects as in the second, or when
the result ofother cau1u, as in the third claH, is unphi­
losophical and absurd. The cases included in the
fourth class can alone be relied on as relevant, and even
here it is only affirmed that they moil probably resulted
from magnetism. Every reader of the cases reported
under this class, will marvel how the committee ascer­
tained that the " eff
ects" were not the result ofthe ima­
gination, especially a1 they were so few and insignifi­
cant, as scarcely to be appreciable.
Io the Hperimtmts intended to prove the existence
of somnambulism among magnetic eff
ects, the cases
as reported are acknowledged to have been utter f
ail..
ures. So also of the boasted faculty of clai"'oyanct,
although some of them held the objects at the pit of
the stomach, as does Mrs. Andros, and others placed
them at the occiput, or the back part of the head u .
does Miss Bracket ; yet the French commissioners ad­
mit that the ball of the eye, in all cases, was kept mov­
ing in the direction of the object, and always looked at
it before placing it either at the epigaatrlim or occiput.
A bandage over the eyes, or even a sheet ofpapflr inter­
posed between their eyes and the object, unifonnly de­
prived them of the faculty of clai"'oyance. And as to
the miracle of looking into the body of another person,
,

or that ofprlriUion or prophesying, which the somoam- ·
bulists aitempted, the report proves that the whole prq.
teoce was delultioa and imposture.
But it were idle any loeger to dwell .npea the e\11-
dences before the world, -both in ancient and modera
times, that the whole art and mystery of Animal Mag..
netilHD is unworthy of the attention of any sober miud,
·and that its miracles are wholly fictitious· and deluai�
And there is obviously abundant evidence before the
reader, as well as in the nature of its ·proceaaes, that
the whole affair is. not only a scandalou11 and mischievous
humbug, disgraceful to all partie11, the guller and the
gulled ; but that the practice ought to be .reprobated by
every friend to the good order ·and morals of the com­
munity. Hence the deep regret which is so generally
felt, that so many excellent men in the learned profea•
aions, and others occupying high places in ilociety,
shoutd incautiously have given their names aad in­
ftuence to the advancement oftlWi humbug. That this
aod kin,_
dred delusions shttuld have prevailed in the dark
ages, need not ·be a source ofwonder ; but that it should
receive countenance in the nineteenth century, demon­
strates the present .to be indeed the age of humbug.
In or-der to detect the true character ef Animal Mag­
netism, and demonstrate it to be a stupenduous humbug,
if we were without any ofthe evidences which its history
furnishes, it would only be necessary to admit its truth
but for a moment ; and we shall see that to suppose its
e:ristence �o the extent claimed, proves too much, and
therefore proves nothing. It is thus that the profeaaon
ofany humbug can be made to stultjf
y themselves.
For example, if the claims ofthe science are true, i&
follows, ·that certain peNoos _ poaseas a power over cer.
60 0 1' .A. l U M .A. L M .A. tHUr. T I S M ,
tain other persons, by which they can at any time, or
at any distance, by a simple "olition, produce magnetic
sleep ; and this, whether the subjects of this involuntary
and irresistible sleep be standing, sitting, walking, or
running, at home or abroad, by sea or by land. And .
this sleep thus willed by another, without the consent
ofits victim, is BO profound that it is impossible to awake
the sleeper by any process. The senses are all closed,
· and no person but the magnetizer has ·power to arouse
the sleeper. It is plain, then, that the magnetizer may
destroy human life at pleasure ; since if the individua.l
over whom he has this power, be in a position in which
sleep would be fatal, he has only to put forth the voli­
tion, and the deed is done. And in the commist!ion of
this and other crime.s0 he would have perfect impunity,
since there are no laws of evidence in human jurispru­
dence, by which guilt could be established. ·
· Besides, ifthe claims ofthe •• science, falsely so called,"
have any foundation, these sleepers may be privy to all
the deeds of darkness and secrecy which are performed
in any place however distant ; for neither darkness,dis­
tance, nor any physical obsttuction hinders their clai"'oy·
anee ; and no other police for the detection of criminals
need be desif'ed than a few .. sleeping beauties," who
might be hourly consulted; especially in referenc-e to any
suspicious persons or houses, and to whom, as to a di·
vine oracle, appeal might be made, when no other vigil­
ance can prevail. And as prevision is also claimed as
a faculty of these somnambulists, future events may be
anticipated, if not preve�ted.
So also there would be an annihilation of all our ·hos­
pitals, and medical colleges, and physicians ; for these
"· medecins endormez n would detect and cure all

manner of diseaaes, by lookiiag into the inaide or the
s�omach, bowels, liver, spleen, lungs,brain, or anyother
· organ of the body,and deiwribing the diaease as well u
naming,the remedy. For all this and much more bu
been and is still claimed by the professors of Animal
Magnetism as fully established ; and all this is as credi­
ble and as true as any other feature of the contemptible
humbug.
It cannot be doubted that if this imposture should
continue to gain credence or countenance in the com­
munity, the infatuation and crimes of the days of Salem
witchcraft are to be re-enacted in our times. For should
an individual be found dead, having fallen into the fire,
it will be ascribed by superstitious believers in the hum­
bug, to some neighbouring or distant magnetizer, whose
witchery has done the deed. And who shall control the
popular indignation, or limit the infliction ofthe penalties
of the Lynch code, should the superstitions of Animal
Magnetism be�ome a public and reigning humbug. The
purest characters in the community may wither beneath
the. calumnies of these clairooyant " factory girls " who
may accuse their neighbours of crimes, which they
· profess to witness during a magnetic reverie ; nor can
such calumnies become. the subject of litigation with the
View to punishment and reparation, since no known code
of laws can be brought to bear in the premises. All
who believe in the humbug; for consistency sake, are
bound to receive the testimony of these somnambulistll
as to what they profess to have seen and heard while
asleep, and to bear ·them harmless from the conse­
quences of their discoveries, inasmuch as they are the
involuntary victims of this wonderful and mystic phi-
losophy.

Tms " science falsely so called," is among the pre­
valent and prevailing humbugs of the day ; and it is
placed ne:irt to Animal Magnetism in the present vol­
ume� because of its claiming to be of similar antiquity,
and of kindred character too ; since both pt"Ofess to be
eminently pbilosophicul. The same individua1s who
erubrnce the one, very frequently become the willing
disciples of the other ; and it is fortunate for the interests
of true science, and for the character of our common
nature, that both are equally vulnerable to defeat and
overthrow, since each of them is capable ofgreat and
coml_)licated mischiefs.
It will not be in place here to enlarge upon the early
hi�tory and great antiq11ity of those theories which ha e
P R R & ft O L O G T .
led men to attempt the explication ofthe phenomena of
mind by physical signs, although all these are now quo­
ted in confirmation of the doctrines of Phrenology. It
will be sufficient for our purpose to name Dr. Gall as
the modem founder of the system at present reigning
under this name ; and to ascribe to his illustrious pupil
Ur. Spurzheim the merit, if it be such, of having devoted
his learning, industry,and eloquence, to the establishment
of the doctrines of his distinguished preceptor, with a
zeal worthy of a better cause.
The doctrines of Phrenology may be briefly stated to
be the following :
lst. The brain is the organ of all our instincts, - pro·
pensities,-sentiments, -aptitudes,- iptellectual f
ae·
ulties,- and moral qualitiea.
_2d. Each of these has a portion of the brain which
is specially appropriated to it, and the developemeot of
these " littl�. brains" or or�ns is manif
ested on the era·
nium or skull ; and by examining these protuberances
or bumps, an adept in the science can ascertain and
describe the dispositions, and intellectual and morai
character of any individual.
This brief surnmaty of the doctrines may suffice,
since they will serve to show the " primordial ideas " l'.ID
which the system is based ; and without pursuing the
subject any further, the reader may estimate the charac­
ter and claims of Phrenology, since the whole may be
. c�
ectly judged by a part, e$pecially by the comer stone
..1ir1he entire edifice; ·
· The name given to the science would lead us to ex­
pect that its foundations would be laid in consistency
with the established laws -0fmental and moral philosophy,
linee it arrogates the title of the " acience of mind."
l' H R E N O L O O Y . 65
Instead of which, however, it will be perceived that the
whole f
abric is ostensibly built·upon the anatomy ofa ma­
terial organ ; .and goes upoJl the bald hypothesis that the
brain, which is the most frail, delicate, and important
structure of the body, in its growth and developement,
not only moulds the form of the head in the plastic and
yielding condition of infancy, but that the exercise or
cultivation of any particular faculty, instinct,. or moral
quality, so increases the part of the brain which is the
supp.osed locality or organ of that faculty, as to result
in a " prominence; protuberance, or bump," upon the
external surf
ace of the skull, by which the form, shape,
and configuration of the bony casement is so essentially
modified and changed, that the phrenologist can detect
and describe the intellectual and mora� character of the
individual, by seeing and feeling the head. The intrin­
sic absurdity and nonsense of this starting pojnt of the
system would have · written the epitaph of Phrenology
long since� but for three cause� ; to the combined influ­
ence of which, this humbug owes its prol<>oged and
temporaryexistence. These causes are the follow�g �
1 st. The array of :great names, including those of
learned and scientific men, who have cultivated and
taught it; and dignified it by the misnbmer of philosophy
and science.
2d. The ridicule and persecution of its votaries, by
which al<>ne it has been chiefly opposed ; f
or, like every
other species of fanaticism, it is thus enabled to enlist
public sympathy, and impose upon popular credulity.
Sd. The native gullibility of human nature, by which
a natural bias exists in most men, and wome1t too, to
believe the marvellous, or the supernatural, without
evidence ; while sober truth, accompanied b:y a� ·
&"'!
66 P H B E lf O L O G Y.
teet.imony, ia rejected, or at leut listened to with doubt
aod incredulity.
The two former causes bp.ve so obviously operated
ill perpetuating and sustaining Phrenology, that they re­
quire no illustration. The latter, however, will not be
•o readily admitted ; for most men can better bear the
impeachment of their ·integrity, thnn an insinuation ad­
verse to �heir intelligence. They seem to prefer blame
to pity,- the charge ofimpostors to that ofdupes, - and
had rather be regarded as knaves, than supposed to be
.fools.
.
In other words, a man seems often to prefer aoy
measure ofreproach and contumely, even for moral delin­
quency,rather than to be written down an ass. There is
but one way, however, to escape the dreaded alternative,
which is to admit into our creed the unwelcome axiom
" this world is given to lyfog ;" or in the quaint expres­
sion of one, " there is the least dependence to be placed
upon mankind, of any people in the world."
One would think a priori that no anatomist could ever
become a believer in Phrenology, so irresistible are the
evidences of its fallacy which the structure of the skull
itself presents ; especially when taken in connexion
with the endless variety in the thicknees of the OOtles
composing it, and the universal dissimmilarity between
the internal structure. of those bones, in diff
erent heads,
by conformation, casualty, disease, and the artificial
means employed by many pagan nations for modifying
the shape of the bead. And yet it i11 true that the
founders and chief writers of the science, have excelled
many of their follows as anatomists, and become be·
lievers in despite of the palpable and insurmountable
difficulties which anatomy has been ever forcing upon
their attention. It is worthy of remark, however, that
- - - --- · -
- - -- . -
P H R E N O L O G Y . 67
they have bestowed all their labour and ingenuity in
searching within the brain itself, for analogies and proof
s
of their theory, while most strangely and inconsistently
they have overlooked the infantile separation of the se­
venll bones of the skull ; their gradual growth and bony
union ; their firm and unyielding constructien acquired
by maturity ; and the physical impossibilities which these
f
eatures ofthe skull itself present, as an argttmentum ad
hominem, against all they have written.
For it must be obvious that after they have exhausted
all their labour and ingenpity in _ the dissection of the
brain ; and even on the absurd supposition, that they
could demonstrate each individual organ by its separate
and distinct formation, and prove incontestably the spe­
cific capacity of each ; still they would not gain an ad­
vance of a single ste.p towards the. establishment of the
pretensions of their science, since the particular struc­
ture of the brain cannot be ascertained in any individual
cas,e, until after death, when the deductions of the sys­
tem oould in no
_
wise increase our stock of practical
knowledge, or, in the least, benefit the living.
It is plain, then, that Prenologists, whilebusying them­
selves in vainly searching for evidences of their system
in the brain itself, have not only been fruitlessly em­
ployed, but they have begun at the wrong end, and
built their pyramid upon its apex. They ·have done
nothing,- theycan do nothing which can commend their
system, or gain confidence among .the discerning, until
the a11atomy of the bead, apart fro� t�at of the brain,
shall be shown to favour their views ; or at least, they
must remove the · physical imp088ibilities which the
atructure of the bony and soft parts constituting the
covering or the brain, so palapably throw in their way.
68 P h R E N O L O G Y .
Let the uninitiated reader learn, that the human brain
i• entirely covered tDithin the alrull by three distinct tu­
nics or coats, which are called the dura mater, the pia
mater, and the arachnoid coat, and which separately in­
terpose between the brain itself and the interior of the
cranium. Let such then be informed, that the skull it­
self is composed of two tables or layers of bone, sepa­
rated by a third or intermediate layer of cellular struc­
ture called the diplore, and ollen by cavities ofgreater or
less extent, utterly unascertainable during life ; and that
a membrane called the pericranium is superadded within
and without ; closely adhering to the several bones.
And le.t him still further be instructed in the fact, that
outside o
f the akuU, between the fingers of the phrenolo­
gist, and the bumps he is pretending to examine, there
are muscles or tendinous expansions of muscles, with
all their accompanying membranes, blood vessels and
nerves, together with the cellular structure, and diff
erent
coats of the skin constituting the hairy scalp, and he
will have a glimpse at the physical impossibilities which
explode the dogmas of this humbug, however much of
ingenuity� learning, and eloquence may be employed in
its defence. The conclusion of any rational man who
will consider these premises, will be · irresistible, and
irrefragable ; -that even on the supposition of the distinct
and separate existence of the thirty-five organs in the
structure of the brain, being vi11ible and tangible _on its
surfaces, which is not pretended ; and on the still further
hypothesis that we were acquainted with the precise
size and capacity of each of these organs with its ap­
propriate function ; we should still be wholly in the dark
in relation to any judgem�nt we might form, during the
life of the individual, because of tbe numerouiJ iuter-.
'
P B IL B J!I' O L O G Y . 69
veniog obstacles, and their ever varying thickness in
different heads. For, had we all this knowledge, we must
first 1calp .the individual, after the fashion of our aborigi­
nal neighbours, ·and we should still find it necessary to
remove the upper part of the skull ; nor even then could
we learn the size or location of the organs, until the
intervening membranes were removed. And should
· we thus operate upon a man, and expose the entire
cerebrum to . the vision of the phrenologist, he would
find, by comparing the elevations QJl the surface of the
brain, with the internal table of ,the skuJI which covered
it, that there was no evidence or impression of the pro­
minent organs, however long they might have been cul­
tivated or exercised during life ; - and upon examining
the cap of the skull he would discover ; that the bump
on the external surface, would very often present a con­
tm:ity instead of a concavity within ; and still farther,
that the elevations and depressions upon the surface of
the brain itself, in no one instance correspond with those
discoverable on the external superficies of the cranium.
And yet in the face of such testimony of the senses,
there are multitudes who adhere with the tenacity of a
deat� grasp, to .every jot and tittle of the new philoso­
phy, and popular delusion continues to render it ai;i at­
tractive and profitable humbug. Men and women of
reason and religion, who eschew fortune-telling, witch­
craft, and astrology1 will nevertheless, su�mit their own
beads, and those of their sons and daughters, to these
fortune-tellers, who itinerate through the country like
other strolling mountebanks, for the purpose of living
without labour, by practising qpo� public gullibility. .
But not only does the anatomy ofthe skull thus present
insuperable barriers to the credibility of phren9logy, but
'10
the structure of the brain itself. affords not the sijght4!st
authority for the arbitrary and ridiculous divisions into
which the sect have consented to dissect it. So· far
from these hypothetical " organs " being found to exi11t
any where but in the prolific imagination of these vision�
aries, there are natural and actual divisions in the brain
which are not ·only inconsistent with the artificial ones1
· but which wholly overthrow the possibility of their ex·
istence.
The multiplied aad beautiful cotivolutions of'the brair11
and which are not only visible on its surf
ace, but dis·
ceroible throughout its entire structure by careful dis­
section, completely overthrow the possibility of the ex·
istence of the pretended separate organs ; not only be·
cause each of these convolutione cross from one organ
into another, of different and eveq opposite functions ;
but they are often themselves divided, by the imaginary
line which separates the one organ from the other ; so
that parts ofthe same convolution of the brain, must not
only perform these various and essentially different offi­
ces ; but must be active in one portion, and inactive in
another. And as the organs are described to be of in­
verted conical or pyram'idal form, the apex being at the
medulla oblongata, or the inferior portion of the cere­
brum, and radiating to the surface next the skull ; it is
plain that every organ must be formed, wholly irrespec­
tive ofthese convolutions ; the lines which divide the one
from the other passing longitudinally, transversely, and
diagonally through their successive layers. Not only
so, but these imaginary lines must pass through the ven­
tricles, the corpus callosum, the fornix, the pulpy and
the fibrous portions indiscriminately, so that each organ
includes more or les1 of these intricate and delicate
\
P B R B N O L O G Y . 71
structures, and many of thc:m are by the. ventricles cut
asunder in the middle. And as these ventricles contain
ftuid, we must suppose that there is an upper and lower
part of some organs, separated by water or serum, the
one from the other, so that they are not only double, but
quadruple !
Another conclusive fact in refutation of this wild
scheme is seen in the essential difference there is in the
convolutions of one hemisphere of the brain, and those
of the opposite side, although the organ is located by
the sect in precisely the same relative position in each
hemisphere. If such organs really exist on each side
of the head, destined jointly to perform the same office,
it would be indeed an anomaly in the animal eronomy,
that they should be entirely dissimilar in their structure ;
for the variations between the opposite organs will ex­
hibit such dissimilarity. In short, ifPhrenology were in
any sense entitled to beliet� in accordance with the
economy of nature, the organs should all be double or
none, while the science lays down a number of single
organs, and others double ; and still worse, there is no
provision in nature, as in other cases, for one of these
to perform the function of the other when disabled ; and
both have been removed by disease, and the function
remained unimpaired l
The natural divisions of the brain into the cerebrum,
the cerebellum, and the medulla oblongata, and the
equally palpable diff
erence between the cortical and
medullary portions, together with the distinct variety of
beautiful structures which lie in the base of the cere­
brum, are all well defined and cognizable by the anato­
mist. But the most powerful microscope ba_s never re­
vealed the existence of any one of the localities, or
72 , P R R B N O L O G Y .
phrenological " organs"s o called, although probably mil­
lions ofhuman brains have been dissected for the purpose
of finding and establishing them. And though such are
the f
acts upon which akme the pretended science · could
be logically based,.not one such has ever been furnished,
although the party are even proclaiming that/acts!facts!
facts I are the foundation of the science.
·
It is plain, then, that if there be facts favourable to the
science, they are not to be found in the anatomy of the
parts concerned ; and we shall be equ.ally unsuccessful
if we search for them in the physiology of tbe brain, not.
withstanding, the brilliant discoveries which L@amed men
have been_making in this department of the profession.
While the patholo�cal observation� of centuries have
demonstrated, that the removal of a part of the brain by
accident or disease, amounting in some instances to an
absolute destruction of8: portion ofits substance, includ·
ing a score or more of single and double organs, ·has
been followed by no diminution or change in the in·
tellectua) or moral faculties ; so that all the "facts" of
pqthology are against them. Nor need reference be
had to the obvious truth, that mental and moral philoso­
phy, highly cultivated as this department of science has
been, by many of the most gifted minds in the universe,
is utterly overthrown by Phrenology. And that the
1cience of Christianity, and the book of Revelation is
entirely a
t variance with Phrenology, needs no other
proof than the f
act every where apparent, that all the
hosts of infidejity are marshalled in its favour, while its
originators, propagators, and pror.nioent t�achers, from
Gall and Spurzheim down to Amariah Brigham, M. D.,
have been either skeptics or free thinkers, Deists or
Atheist&, neologists or materialists.
P H ll :& N O L O O T . 78
Where, then, are the " facts " by which this humt.ug itl
professedly sust!lined, and by which ·ao many of our
citizens are gulled,into its reception t They are to be
sought after, and only to be found in the experiments ef
the sect upon the beads of their dupes. A professor
o( phrenology applies his " taclua 1·egalis " to the bumps
of' some blockhead, and pour� ioto his ear the discov­
ery that be has " organs " c1ualif
ying him for great l ite­
rary and moral elevati on ; capacities to excel in Chis, that,
or the other art or science, and propensities leading him
to some particu lar employments. If a developement
of the total failure of the my tic sc ience be then shown
by the character and acknowledged habits of the indi­
vid ual , still though he be proverbially an a . , he never­
theless ha the " organs," and might have been a Solon.
What he is we koow,- what he might have been, we
know not, and of course dare not contradict this " Pllre­
nologicat Jact." A thousand of such " facts " c a n be
furnished by aoy itinerant pedler in the wares of phre­
nology ; aod , as in Animal Magnetism, the failure of
the somnambulist oine times out of ten, is no argu ment
against the single fact of h�r success in one single in­
stance ; so the phrenologit1t claims that one single
" fact ,, of correctly interpreting a particular hump i
" confirrnntiou strong as holy writ," since " facts
are stubborn things," while failures arn incidental to
every system, and llre all ea ily disposed of by the art
of the. party.
" An amusing circu mstance has lately come to light
as connected with Mr. Combe's work, aod his ph.renolo­
!,rical facts. It will be recollected by ony one who has
read it, - and a more entertaining work on phrenology
tloes not exist, - how ofien he supports his views by

drawings of Raphael's skull, compared with the skulls
ofpeople noted for deficiency in imagina&iYe and picto­
rial talent. An extremely ingenious and well written
paper l'ublished in the Phrenological Journal. Vol. ii. p.
327, also traces the minutest shade1 of Raphael's cha·
racter and disposition in the protuberances of this same
skull. It now appears, the akuU no more belonged to
Raphael than to Judas Iscariot I Raphael's tomb -was
opened but the other day, and his skeleton was found per­
fect. skull and all ! " See For; Q. Review, Oct. 1833,
p. 438. And yet this is one of the phrenological Jach!
which Spurzbeim and others have been proclaiming
with trumpet-tongue, to furnish so ample proof of phre·
nology.
Thus, when an illiterate, stupid, indolent, and conceit­
ed knave is told by the phrenologist that the develope­
ments ofhis .. organs " indicate thathe is, or may become
readily:, a linguist, a philosopher, and a saint ; he " lays
the flattering unction to his soul," and forthwith pays
his fee, and departs with his " character " in his pocket,
and is recorded as another ofthe " stupendous facts of
the sublime science." And although this may be re·
garded as au extreme case, yet the most sk_ilful practi­
tioner on public credulity in .this department, furnilhes
i,imilar " f
acts," and becomes himself humbugged by
his own gullibility. Phrenologists are keen enough to
discern that flattery is a correct coin among their dupes ;
and hence they are careful to discover in the bumps so
many good qualities, as to counteract the bad ones, aud
then throw in a few faculties in conf
ormity with the les­
son they have all learned, that " the art of plcn11in@,
consists in sending every one away, well pleased \\ ith
themselves." Acting on tbis maxim, they are ever
P ll R E K O L O G Y. '15
makiog convert11 to their h•1mbug, even from the ranks
of oppesers, by the magic- and mystic words, " A re­
markable head," a " capital study for a phrenologist,"
" must havo a cast," " Temarkably intellectual," " ain­
·gular developement ofindi�iduality, causality and form,"
" great ideality," " very large benev()lence," " promi­
nent veneration and caution," " very little combative­
ness," " small destructiveness," " the animal propensi­
ties not much developed," &c;. &c. ; and many a physi.­
cian, lawyer, and clergyman have been brought over to
phrenology, by the f
ancied evidence of talents which' its
pref
essors point out upon their heads ; and often when
nobody else has ever been able to dis.ever that they were
above mediocrity. - Indeed there are many f
ools, who
are wise in their owll conceit, because forsooth, some
strolling mountebank has sold thema phretMlogical chart,
and a description of character as indicated by tht-ir
bumps. Sµch great men, owing their greatness to the
discoveries of the science, are clamorous in its praise,
and zealous in its defence. They occasionally have
their zeal moderated, and their conce" lowered by find­
ing that one lecturer on this humbug discovers upon '
their heads the presence or absence of bumps, entirely- -
opposite to the indications pointed out by others ; though
all of them contriYe to please, by sufficiently sprinkling
the spice of flattery into the phrenological dish, which
is served up fOI' tbeae victims of hmnbug, whose " or­
gan of 1elf-Nletm." is often so large, that it extends
from head to bee). ·
The moral aspect of phrenological doctrines is that,
however, which renders the humbug the most mischiev- 1
oua and deplorable. Multitudes go to the scieace for
the purpose of eaiug a loaded coneoience, by leaming ,
76 P H R -. !f O L O O T .
lthat their delinquencies and vices are constitutional, and
depending wholly on organization. Such nod a false
peace,- an imaginary comf
ort in the doctrine, thatvirtue
and vice. are alike the result of organs implanted by the
Creator, and thus persuade themfflves into the disbelief
ofhuman accountability. And learning, as they do, that
they are irresiatibly under the inftuenee of their pro­
peDSities to which the animal organs impel them, they
despair of reformation, notwithstanding its necessity is
so obvious to themselves and others. And here they are
taught to regard the lascivious man to be prompted by
the organ of " amativent'lss," formed by the muscles of
tile neck ; - the liar to be driven by the developement
of " secretiveness," - the thief by that of " acquisitive­
ness," - " the desperado by " combativeness, " - the
drunkard by " alimentiveness,'' - and the murderer by
" destructiveness." While on the other hand, the vir- ·
tues ofcharity, truth, honesty, peaceableness, and broth·
ly kindness are the results either of the absence or di­
minished size of these organs, or the counteracting in­
ffuence of others. Hence a man i11 religious, or other­
wise, by reasoo of a physical necessity, since the promi­
nence, or the depression of the top of the head, where
the organs ofveneration, theosophy, and marvellousness
- are located, must irresistibly result in one or the other
character. But we must not call this materialism or
fatalism, else a hue and cry of persecution is raised, as
though the sympathy of heaven and earth should be
moved in behalf of this precious humbug.
One can scarcely suppress his laughter at the com­
placency with which phrenolOgists boast of the pro­
digious novelty, ingenuity, and cGDvenience of their
nomenclature, and the newly ceiued words it has intro-
1
P H R. ll: N O L OG Y . TT
duced into ourlanguage. That it possesses the attribute
ofsimplicity, cannot be denied ; for be must be a simple­
ton indeed; who does not take the idea conveyed by
" alimentirimua, pl&iloprogenitiveneaa, cOfltbativeneaa, and
dut1"UCmmua.'1 It is matter .of wonder that they did
not adopt among their classical technicalities, " gullibili­
tiveness, humbugitiveness, phrenologitiveness," all of
which might be introduced as synonymes for the organ
of wonder or marvellousness ; and would be equally
elegant, besides being both significant and appropriate.
. Nor is their " map of regions," less ludicrous, si�,
with all the accuracy of a geometrician, with compasses
and rule, they gravely describe on paper a map of their
own brains ; discoursing learnedly and eloquently upon
each particular organ, and indicating its locality with as
much minuteness as that with which the modern Sir
John Herschel described the geography ofthe moon by
the aid of his phrenological telescope. Next, they
mark on the skull of some luckless wight, or upon tlieil'
plaster busts, the mystic numbers of the thirty-five
organs ; and then draw black lines around each in imita­
tion of. " the illustrious expunger," who is probably a
phrenologist, and may have derived the process from
this sublime 11cience. But still more, they provide casts
jn imitation ofthe brain itself; and they mark these with
their magic figures and beautiful nomenclature, until
every man may hold the model in his hands, and by the
aid of phrenology, read the arcana of his own brains.
And, pl'Ovided with these paraphernalia of office, every
wi1eacre of the party is at once dubbed a pro
fostJOt' of
the celestial humbug, and prepared to enlighten the na•
tion into all the intricacies of mental and moral science ;
while in the capacity of a phrenological fortune-teller,
7•
.
78 P H R E N O L O G Y.
he strolls through the country in aearch of subjects on
whom to experiment, by fumbling their heads io pursuit
of " facta" in the form ofphrenological bumps. . Such is
a aad, but true picture of the reign of humbug in this de­
partment, while popular credulity still prolongs the
delusion.
From what has been said, without any further ampli­
fication, the reader may form an accurate conception of
the 'system ; and be able to understand the authorities
for the " map of regions," which baa been laid. down on
the-surface of the head, by which the various f
aculties
and propensities are located. This may be seen in the
various busts and drawings, which are sufficiently nu­
merous in every part of the country, and which are
potent in making uninitiated rustics stare and wonder
at the mysteries of the philosophy eftheir own brains•
. The reader will perceive that phrenology is only an
extension of the science of phyaiognomy, though pos- ­
aessing infinitely less philosophy and truth. For while
Lavater interpreted the expression and form ofthe coun·
tenance, as indicative of the mental constitution and
character, yet he relied upon the visible and tangible
a.ction of the muse.lee of the face, which, to a great ex­
tent, are acknowledged to be . under the influence of
volition and habit. But Dr. Galf relies upon the invisi­
ble a'!d intangible action, which he gratuitously supposes
the brain to perform ; and which, if it really existed,
must necessarily be unappreciable, because of the
solidity and thickness of the bones of the cranium, after
the age of puberty ; although be and his disciples con­
tend for the validity oftheirmaps of developemeots, dur.
ing every period of life, even to advanced age. Aod
tbe important circumstances, so .of\en meotiooed, that
'p HR B'N 0 L 0 G T . 79
tbe department» of the brain, which phrenology desig­
nates with so much accuracy and minuteness, neither
agree with the natural div�ions of the brain, which-are
llO remarkable, nor with the metaphysical classification
of the mental phenomena, has neither been gaiosayed
nor refuted.
But even on . the admjssion of the whole of the " pri­
mordial ideas," still it would be easy to show that the
artificial. division and appropriation of the functions to
distinct localities, as taught by phrenology, is wholly
arbitrary and fictitious. This will be obvious, when.the
reader is informed that the first grand discovery of Dr.
Gall, and which has led to the whole of the numbers
and localities which the maps of the regions exhibit, as
subsequently laid down by himself and others, was
made under the following circumstances : He observed,
while yet at school, that all his fellows who were distin­
gukihed at the public examinations, were indebte<l for
their success to an extraordinary memo1'Y, and that they
all had 'Dery promi�nt eye1. This remarkable coinci­
dence, led him irresistibly to the conclusion, that there
must be. some mysterious connexion between a good
tMmory and a protuaion ofthe eye-ballafrom the socket ;
such as that for which some persons are so remarkable.
And, on this momentous thought having taken posses­
eioo of his brain, at once he leaped to the still further .
conclusion, that every other faculty must be connected
with other external conformations.
But for this accidental discovery of the organ of me­
mory, being located in the eye1, and its perfection being
developed by their size and promi•mce, the world might
have yet been in the dark whether we bad any " organs ;"
nor alMwld we he poaeaaed ofa m., ofour own brains,
80 P H R E N O L O G Y .
which is now, thanks to Dr. Gall, the privilege uf e\'ery
m11n and woman in christendom.
But while Dr. Gall located· this organ of memory in
the eyes, his pupil, Dr. Spurzheim, denominates it " the
organ oflanguage ;" by which term he means to convey
the idea, that " prominent eyes" indicate not only phi-
. lological memory, but an aptitude for the study of lan­
guages. All phrenologists agree in attributing thef
aculty
o
f speech, and the power of articulating sounds to the
ey11, and great skill in the use of language to their
prOMinence. And Dr. Gall used to exhibit in proof of
this ridiculous conceit, the cranium of ll lunatic who
was unable to articulate words, in which the roof
s of
the orbits were arched, and this organ small ; or, in
other words, the eyes were not prominent.
As this faculty is avowedly the origin of all the dis­
coveries made by Gall, and the cause of all his re­
searches, as well as the foundation of the whole science
of phrenology, the reader who will acquaint himself
with the anatomy of the eye, and the cauaea ofitsprom­
inence, may readily satisfy himself that this " corner­
stone" of the entire edifice, is a mere fiction and fable.
Nor can he persuade himself to believe that the stn1c­
ture and relative position of the human eye, while it is
so admirably adapt� by the Creator for the purposes of
vision, is at the same time designed to impart the f
aculty
o
f apeech, and the articulation of eiounds, for which it
has no degree of adaptation, while locally disconnected
with those organs, whose elaborate structure indicates
their design and use for this important and essentially
diff
erent function. :!nd yet all the phrenological au­
thorities will be found · to inculcate the doctrine, that
" large and promioaat.eyea ,, indicate the developement ·
P-U B. E M O L O G Y . 81
of " the organ of memory anq language," though Spurz-
1heina is so
"
very particular as to inform us that for the
perf
ection of this organ we are to look, not merely for
" large and prominent eye•, but at the same time, pres­
s.ed, as it were ! towards the lower part of the orbit ;" a
coincidence which will be found in practice to be a11
scarce as instances of white croto1. This appendage
of Spurzheim; appears to have been designed to meet
the objections· to the science which were constantly
multiplying upon the band� of practitioners in this art
and mystery, who found thousands of examples, in which
" large and prominent eyes," were connected with a ,
deficiency both in " memory and langaage." He, there­
fore, adds to the description of the organ that the " large
and prominent eyes must, at the same time, be pruaed
towards th� lower part of the orbit," and the convenient
words " ar it were,'� are parenthetically introduced for
wise and obvioas purposes. With such an equivocal
definition of signs, a· common fortune-teller would rival
the moat acute phrenologist in developing character.
And, we need hardly add,
'
that as the " science" is as
applicable to all other animals as man, that no human
example of the perfect developement of " the organ of
language and memory " can be produced, which will
at all compare with the claims posseRsed by an OwL !
We have dwelt a moment on this first discovery of
Dr. Gall, because it was the origin and cause of all his
researches, the primum mobile of the whole machinery
of the system. And as this philosopher was impelled
by 110 pure a fiction, to proceed in the location of the
faculties and propensjties in the variou1 parts ofthe brain,
it is not to be wondered at, that the divisions which be
and bis followers have successively discovered, marked,
82 P H IUl N OL () G Y ,
and numbered upon their maps and casts, should, like
the first, be wholly arbitrary ; nor will it be found, that
any one of them possesses any greater claim to our
confidence, either drawn f�om philosophy or facts ;
though of the latter, they are ever proclaiming them­
selves the discoverers and inventors ; and upon these
alone they profess to rely.
Another specimen of thefacts, upon which phrenology
· has authoritatively located the " organs " of the human
mind, and an exhibition of the slender basis on which
these localities rest, may be seen in the " Jove of off­
spring," which Spurzheim calls the propensity of " phi­
loprogenitivenen," and which both he and bis illustrious
master, place in the posterior and inferior part of the
head ; and when much developed, forming a large
prominence above the centre of the neck.
The reader must preserve his gravity, while the history
of this " discovery" is thus accuratety developed by a
distinguished phrenologist. 0 Dr. Gall had long known
that the back part of the head was more prominent in
fema[eB, children,
·
�and monkeyB, than in men, but was .
utterly unable to account for this wondrous fact, even
after he had Jong believed and taught the science. At
lllllt, however, a clergyman who attended his lectures,
led him to the true solution of this problem, which had
so long puzzled his brains, by reminding him that the
• love of offspring' was remarkable in women ! and female
monkeys !" This striking collocation and astonishing
, coincidence, conclusively established the organ of " phi�
loprogenitiveness,,, as it is now called ; and it has since
received conclusiYe confirm1ttion by another prodigious
, fact; discovered by the lamented Spurzheim, that it is
this orgao which inducll8 youtig girla to play toith dol1' !"

Sooh are a few examples of the Jacu upon which every
" faculty, propensity, and sentimen1 " of man and all
� other animals, have been laid down in maps of the brain,
with more than mathematical . precision ; and they and
their definite localities are now learnedly spoken of with _
magisterial authority. But we forbear to enlarge on
these several topics, and shall confine our observations
to a few of those which present the science in its moral
aspect ; and, as we think, demonstrate its infidel ten­
dencies. And the first of these we would present, is
the " organ of moral aenae," or " benetJoltnce ;" for these
dispositions, according to the system, are owfog to the
" developcment " on the " superior, anterior part of the
head, just above the forehead." From the universal
-presence of this " organ," phrenologists maintain that
" man is naturally good ;" and that " the question so
often agitated among philosophers, whether man is bon1
with a disposition to good or evil," has been settled
definitely by the " science." It is scarcely necessary
to say, that the authority of Revelation is here utterly
rejected, and tho mul,tiplied _ testimonies of the Bible
denied ; nor need we add, that the history of every n!l·
tion under heaven, demonstrates the fallacy of the posi­
tion, and of the system which inculcates it.
-
·
Immediately in a neighbouring locality, on the upper
part of the head, is the " organ_ of marvellousriess," or
" the love ujsupernatural ob
jects," while near the crown of
the head is the " organ of theosophy," which Spurzheim _
divides into three " organs," viz. " veneration," " con·
scientiousness," and " hope." Upop these several organs
depend, according to the system, the disp?sitions to see
and believe in visions, ghosts, witches, and supernatm'al
revelations, together with all belief in the existence o
f a
84 . P R R Jl. N O L O G T .
God, all idea of a Supreme Being, all propensity towards
'"°r1hip, devotion,piely, love of God, idolatry, &c. &c.
And it can scarcely be necessary to remark, that this
single fact - that all these diasimilar and even -opposite
sentiments, in which good and evil, virtue and viet>,
reality and delusion, truth and falsehood, are mingled in
hete.-ogeneous combination ; and yet all ascribed to the
same " organs " and " developements,'' - is enough to
brand the system which recognises such absurdity, not
merely with infidel character and tendency, but with
profound stupidity and folly. And to exhibit the immo­
rality of such a vile imposture upon public credulity, ir it
weTe at all needful, would be easy, by simply repeating
the opinions of Gall and, Spurzheim, in their arguments
in . favour of the validity of their designation of these
organs. Alluding to those who believe in ghosts, vis­
ions, and·witches, and indeed in any supern1ttural reve­
lations ; they tell us, that " this disposition which loves
what is astonishing, mysterious, or miraculous, is the
immediate result of a particular organization ; and it
would be as unjust to accuse those endou1ed with it, of
imposture, as it would be to censure poets for imbody­
ing and personif
ying their ideas ; for they are only the
.
slaves ofa too energetic action·ofone part ofthe b1·ain.''.
If this be not sublimated impiety, materialism, and fa­
talism, we know not where these characteristics are to
be found ; . and that such sentiments anniliilate all morn!
distinctions between truth and falsehood, vice and virtue,
is too obvious to need comment. And yet they go on
to tell us, that in the creation of the organ of marvellous­
ness, NA.TURK had views and intentions, which serve to
strengthen our faith, and fortif
y our belief, and thus
riature, not the " God of nature,'7 is repres�nted to be

But, in relation to the " organ of theosophy," or " vene­
ration," these phrenologists more distinctly disclose
their gross and unmingled atheism. Here we are
taught that " some persons, for want of this organ, have
no capacity for religious instruction, while others, who
possess the orgr.n, receive it with the greatest eager­
·ness ;" and surely if there be those who have " no ca­
pacity " for religion, because of their " physical organi­
zation," their accountability is annihilated ; and those
who are religious, because of a dift'
ercnt organization,
are equally victims of uncontrollable destiny ; nor cao
virtue or vice be pred icated in either case. Indeed, all
this and more, is unblushingly avowed ; for they affirm
that •� our ideas on all subjects depend on our being
furnished with organs to originate, or to give birth to
tbetn ; and we have an idea of God, as we have love of
off
spring, benevolence, &c., because we have an organ
fitted for such a purpose." And still they maintain that
man, wberev�r he is found, bas the " organ oftheosophy,"
and hence a " sentiment of the existence of the Divini­
ty is iflnatc, and inherent in our nature." And yet they
add, that there is a great diff
erence between this senti­
ment and the 1·e·velations, dogmas, mysteries, &c., of
different rdigious sects. And it is obvious, that the
revelations of christianity, and of the :Bible, are here
·aimed at as among the religious sects, whose dogmas and
mysteries phrenology disclaims. This disclaimer might
have been spared, however, since there is a mutual and
irrepressible repulsion, which mus
.
t eternally separate
phrenology from christianity ; and, we think, sufficient
evidence is now before the reader, that from the nature
of this science, falsely so callec1, its votaries
.
mWlt not

86 l' H R E. N O L O G Y .
ouly believe ours lo be literally " a world 1''ithout 101"8,"
but equally " without Goa."
Among the distinguished men, howernr, who it mu11&
be granted have cultivateiand promoted phrenological
investigations, and who are not to be classed with th11
strolling pedlers of the science whom they despised,
_Dr. Gall's celebrated and distinguished pupil and coadju­
tor, Dr. Spurzheim, deserves ho11ourable mention. But
great as were his talents, industry, le&rning and elo­
quence, all of which he zealously consecrated to phre­
nology, and to which science he devoted his life, even
to martyrdom ; yet no one can candidly peruse his work
without perceiving evidence of his proneness to fanati­
cism. Whether this was constilutional, and the fruit of
the " organ of marvellousness " in his upper story, we
need not determine. · The single fact that he was an
admirer of Animal Magnetism, and a believor in its
humbugs, is of itself decisive in i;elation to the calibre of
his gullible organs ; and we might a priori anticipate
that the kindred humbug of phrenology would be an ob­
ject of his faith. But there are other palpable evidences
in the works of this truly great man, which amply show
that while rejecting divine testimony . to some of the
most important doctrines of Revelation, he was ne¥er-
. theless, credulous to a fault in regard to every thing ·
claiming to be supernatural or miraculous, when its ad­
yoeates disclaimed the agency of Deity , and alleged
. science and philosophy as explaining the causation of
the phenomena. Hence the enthusiasm with which he
embraced and adhered to phrenology.
But it were needless to enlarge on this and kindred
�opi�, which will sugges� themselves to the reader,
P D R E N O L O L G Y . 87
since it is only neees:mry for any individual to inquire
into the opinions of the leading writers, professors, lec­
turers, and practitioners of phrenology, on the subject
of the inspiration of the Scripture�, and revealed reli­
gion, and ample evidence will be furnished that the re­
ception of this miscalled science is incompatible with a
belief in the truths of Scriptural Christianity. And al­
though it is not insinuated that " facts" are to be denied,
or " philosophical truths" rejected, because oftheir con­
flicting, or seeming to do so, with the prevailing views
of Divine Revelation, yet the existence of such contra­
riety is a valid reason for our scrutinizing the alleged
.. facts and truths," by which such a system is sustained.
And after we have arrive(at the conclusion that such a
system is based only upon "falsefacts," and " imaginary
truths," it is allowable to urge the infidel and immoral
tendency of such a fabric of error, as a collateral argu­
ment against its reception and cultivation.
In repudiating phrenology, therefore, its tendency to
skepticism, materialism, and infidelity, as exemplified by
its influence upon its votaries, is only appealed to in
proofthat error is in its own nature, adverse to morality
and religion. Nor is this tendency the reason, or any
reason for rejecting the " science," but is superadded
to the substantial reasons found in Anatomy, Physio­
logy, Intellectual and Moral Philosophy, as well as in
the intrinsic absurdities aud monstrosities of the sys­
tem itself. And it is only after establishing and su11�
tainiug the position, that the whole fabric of phrenology
is absurd, its pretensions false, its boasted "facta" un·
founded, and its philosophy all fiction and f
able, that we'
allow ourselves to warn the community against its re-
88 l' H & Jt 1' 0 L O G 1' .
eeption, by showing its legitimate fruits to be perniciou••
and destructive to religious principle and morn! charac­
ter. And we allege this to be the result, not of its he·
iog at varinoce with revelation, but as a consequence of
its being false.

Tn1s stupendous humbug, although it might fitly be in­
cluded in the chapter devoted distinctively to quack·
ery, yet because ofthe prominence it has attained, and
the prodigious pretensions it has set up, deserves to be
singled out for separate animadversion.
This new technical has been introduced to designate
the system of Dr. Hahnaman for curing diseases by a
new, simple, and lilliputian process. This German sa­
var who modestly says in his preface, " the true art of
healing begins with me," very consistently begins by
denouncing all the medical theories which have been
accumulating for two thousand years, as well as all
the experience and observation of so many centuries aa
" learned lumber" which is to be utterly rejected, and
S.lff
90 H O JI CB O P A T • I .& .
which he labours to supplant and overthrow by bis
" New Art of Healing." The maxim adopted by Hah­
neman, and which he calls the hommopathic law of na­
ture, is thus expressed " aimilia aimilibm curantur,"
which is the opposite to the prevalent doctrine so fre­
quently and so rationally exemplified both by nature and
art, •• contraria contrariis cumntur." .By the former
dogma, he maintains that the same remedy which pro­
duces given symptoms in a healthy body, will cure any
similar symptoms in the diseased body. And all that
ia necessary is to develope the drug-virtue by a1e�h11D.;
ical tributation and dilution ;- and he alleges that the
power or virtue ofa dmg is thus developed ad infinitum
in the direct ratio ofthese processes, and in the indirect
ratio of the qu_antity, so that the doses can ne"er be too
amall. Hence he divides every medical agent into
" infintesimal doses " by laborious and complicated
processes, very learned and .accurate descriptions · of
which he gives in his works ; and this course is pursued
not merely with the active poisons which he retains in
his materia medica, but with the most inactive and· ab:..
solutely inert agents. A single grain of common salt,
for example, which hoD_lreopathists regard as possessed
of immense healing virtues when " pcitenzized " by tu­
tu ration and dilution, is divided by repeated solutions
until it is reduced very many million;; of atoms less than
a grain. And when the drug-virtue is thus developed
the " potenz, " of this infintesimal dose of common
table-salt is capable of producing eight hundred and
ninety-five serious and dangerous i
orms of drug-sick­
ness, and by consequence is curative inful libly in all
the variety ·of diseases in which these symptoms, or any
of them appear. And even tllen, so much caution is
H O M CE O P J. T •H I A • 91
necessary in the use of this inconceivably small dose of
common salt, that they are not to take a drop, but
the drop must be divided by admix�ures Jest its "'ia.
tensely raised energy " might be fatal. In many cases
Hahneman directs, that this dreadful medicine shoukl
not be given internally, even after all this dilution ; but
recommends that a pellet of sugar-of-milk not larger
than a hempseed, should be moistened with this ftuid,
and then the patient may aniell this pellet once in fifteen
or twenty days ! While in other cases, thus to smell a
single pellet would ho mischievous, and even dangerous ;
and hence the patient is directed only to smell the cor1'
out of the phial containing the pullets, once a month, but
on no account to smell the phial itself!
The theory upon which bomCllopathia selectsits reme­
dies is briefly this : Whatever symptoms are produced
in the human body in a state of health, by any substance
introduced into the stomach, whether by accident or de­
sign, the same symptoms occurring in any disease will
be cured by an infintesimal dose of the same substance.
Of course, when it is clearly ascertaieed that any one
.
ternedy is useful In the treatment of a diseaSf!, it is
proved a priori or a posteriori, that the same remedy
would produce that disease in a healthy body ifthe doM!
were increased. Hence the materia medica of Hahne­
man and homreopathic physicians is made up ofa cata-
'
logue of the symptoms or drug-sicknesses produced in
the healthy body, by allwopathic'lf doses of the diff
erent
medicinal agents.
• By the term Allceopatbic, in contradistinction from Homreo­
patbic, this sect mcun the common or large doses of medieine
usually employed by the regular faculty, as distinguished from
their owu lilliputian or infinteeimal doses. Such is the uae Hah·

phur or common brimstone being capable of producing
many thousands of different symptoms, is therefore pre­
scribed in a great variety of organic and functional dis·
eases, acute and chronic, all o f which are attributed t o a
latent Itch ! for with this disease Hahneman affirms
nearly all mankind are afilicted from their birth, and
hence the miraculous cures effected even by the fifieeo
hundredth dilution ofa single grain of sulphur, by reason
of its antipsoric powers which have made it the basis of
itch remedies in every part of the world.
In an anonymous publication, lately published in New­
york, will be found an extract from the Gazette Medi­
cale for 1835, whii::h presents a curious apd ludicrous
picture of the homaiopathic preparation or attenuatio11
of medicines, which we give in the language of the re­
viewers of Dr. Panvini, physician to the hospital della
Pace, &c., accompanied by the calculation, in figures,
of the unknown author of this pamphlet, which is enti-
neDKn makes of this appellative. This theory similia rimilibiu
curantur, be denominates by the significant title Homceopathia;
and ho designs by the phrase Allceopathia to indicate the system
which adopts the opposite maxim, contraria contrariia curantur.
Tho!e who wish to see a more extended examination of this whole
subject, will fin<l it in the work of Dr. Wm. Leo Wolf, a German
scholar and physician, entitled " Remark& on the Abracadabra.•
ofthe nineteenth century."

tied " Anatomy of a Humbug," and contains much
other evidence of acquaintance with the subject.
" Homceopathists have adopted for the multiplier of
their attenuations the uumber 100. Thus, when the
medicine is a liquid, we take a drop of it, which we
mix with 100 drops of alcohol. This is the first atten­
uation or dilution. For the second dilution, 10,000
drops are required, and so on ; always multiplying b)ll
100, until the thirtieth or even _furtieth dilution.
" Dr. Panvini has calculated bow much alcohol would
be required for the dilution of a single mcdiciaal drop,
and how much sugar for the. attenuation of a grain of
1olid substance reduced to a powder, so as to reach th�
thirtieth or fortieth di!ution.
!' The first dilution of a drop of_ tincture of chamomile,
for example, would demand, as has just been said, lOQ
dfOpS of alcohol.
" The second, 10,000, or nearly a pound.
" Third, 100 pounds, or about a barral.•
'' Fourth, 100 barrels.
•• Fifth, 10,000 barrels.
" And so on, and so on i the ninth, as much alcohol
as the lake of Agnano could contain.
" The twelfth, one hu_ndred million laJtes of Agnano.
" The seventeenth, 10,000 Adriatic seas.
'" The thirtieth, as much alcohol as the terrestrial
globe, all our planetary system, and pi;rhaps all the stara
ofthe first and second magnitudes that we can discover
oa a beautiful summer night � to whicb must be added,
f
or the fortieth dilution, all the constellations we can
discover from one pole to the other ! Aa to p1dve1iied
sqba&aoees, analogoua propQrtions."
• Thia must he an Italian barrel, 1maller than ours.
94 H O M IE O P J. T B I A .
" To attain them infinite dilution�, only a drop ofeach
dilution is used to be still further diluted ; otherwise the
universe could not supply the bolllC'lopathians with ma­
ferial to attenuate their medicine.
" The above statements may seem incredible ; but
figures are not apt to lie or deceiv.e. A grain of char­
coal or sulphur, mixed with sugar, and attenuated to
the fortieth degree, would require the following amount
of sugar in grains :
·
100,000,000,ooo,ooo,ooo,coo,ooo,
ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,oo­
O,OOO,OOO,OOO,OOO,OOO.OOO-equivalent to the following

33383333333333333333333333333333333333333333
33333333333333. Allowing two thousand pounds to
a ton, this grain of sulphur, charcoal, flint, or rock
crystal, would require, to !'educe it to the f
ortieth degree
of attenuation, the following number of tons of sugat
- 6041 66666666666666666666666666666666666'60-
6666666666666666666666666666666 ! ! ! ! "
But Hahneman not only attributes remedial influ­
ences to the numerous active and inert articles which
he employs, but insists that all the substances in nature
are continually developing remedial influence, which is
imperceptibly acting upon the animal organism ; and
when be fails to cure · diseases, he ascribes his want of
success, not to a deficiency in the potenzized virtues of
his drugs, . but to some invisible and intangible agent
which counteracts bis remedies. This process lie find11
vastly convenient in all cases of fatal diseases ; and
hence he depends on the absence of all remedial influ­
ence, other than that which he employs. If the patient
bas ever in his life been under the influence of c11.lomel,
or even taken an allceopatbic dose of this or any other
H O M CE O P A T U I A , 95
drug, the result of his curative mc·ans must be doubtful.
Of course his patients must, on no account, submit to
any other than homceopathic treatment, .else the direct
or after operation ofhis drug-sicknesses will be likely, by
the " intense!y raised energy and virtue" of his poten­
zes, to result in an explosion by coming in contact with
some other imperceptible remedial influence.
The mischievous eff
ect of roses upon the eyes, by
seeing or smelling them, or living in the neighbourhood
· where they grow, is one of the immortal discoveries of
homreopathia ; for if rose-water which contains a ho·
mceopathic or infintesimal dose of the drug-virtue of rose­
leaves, will sometimes cure opththalmia or inflammation
of· the eyes, it is morally certain that to see or smt>ll of
roses will occasion sore eyes, unless some counteract­
ing remedial influence be simultaneously operating.
And so if stramonium, or belladonna, be growing in the
neighbourhood ; or if men live in the vicinity of charcoal,
or sulphur, or flinty rocks ; or if they even pass by an
apothecary shop, and inhale musk or any other aromatic
vapour ; pleasant, or otherwise, the drug symptoms of
some of these potenzes will be produced ; for it is im­
possible to avoid receiving into the lungs an infintesimal
dose of these medicinal agents ; and as it is impcssible
that the dose can be too small, it is impossible to breathe
the atmosphere which surrounds the earth, or drink the
purest water flowing from its centre, without suffering
continually from a homreopathic dose of one or the
other of the remedial influences which are mystically
and perennially acting upon the animal organism. So
that whether we will or not, and whether sick or well,
in our own estimation, it is impossible to escape drug-
1ickness ; for hommopathic doses are found in the air ;
96 lJ O M <& O P .A. T H J A .
upon the earth is food and drink ; above, beneath, around,
.. they throng the air, and darken heaven/' so that active
remedial influences are every where acting medicioally ;
and when an over dose of any one of these is not couo·
teracted, by its appropriate antidote, we are all exposed
to danger and death from these imperceptible agencies.
Hahneman being a full believer in all these crudities,
and unheard of niceties, is exceedingly particular . in
dire.cling the preparation of his medicines, by reducing
their quantity to the borders of infinity, or the close
· proximity to nothing. Thus he says, " Take one grain
of any solid substance, and one third of 100 grains of
sugar-of-milk, and put them together in a porcelain ves­
sel. Mix the medicine and sugur an instant with an
ivory spatula ; then triturate the mixture with some little
force six minute11 ; theu detach the mass from the bottom
oflhe vessel four minutes, till ii becomes homogeneous ;
then triturate it again six minutes with the same force.
Four other minutes are employed to re-unite the powder
in a mass, and then add the second third ofthe sugar-of
.
milk ; mix it an instant with a spatula, then tritumte with
an equal force, six minutes ; then re-unite in u heap or
mass, four minutes ; then Hturute it again six minutes ;
then, after having scraped it again four minutes, add the
last third of the sugar-of-milk, which must be mixed by
stirring it with the spatula ; then trilurate it with force
six minutes ; scrape it four minutes ; then terminate by
triturating and mixing six minutes." This single process,
however, only reduces the drug to its hu11dredth dilution.
One grain of this is then carried through a similar pro­
cess, with another hundredth of sugar-of-milk ; and this
process is to be repeated uot only fifteen hundred tin:1e's,
as in the case Qfsulphur, but in other cases, until a grain
.• H O M G: O P A T B J .l • 97
ofthe preparation shall be reduced to the forty-millionth
part of a grain of the original medicine. And even
then we are in many cases only to ilmell it ; or when
this is too activE', we are to smell the cork once in three,
four, or six weeks.
The homreopathic physicians are ever boasting of
the learning and ingenuity of Hahneman, of whoso pro­
digious discoveries they speak with rapture ; especially
of that by which he has " contrived to divide with ae­
curacy one drop into any desirable number of parts,"
which is among the unheard of niceties which are indis­
pensable to his " true art of healing.'' And another
equally marvellous discovery' in proof of the almost uni­
versal hereditary Itch with which mankind are infected,
is that gravely announced by himself as a .. great truth,"
that " a ne10 born baby, only a few days old, will con­
stantly i·ub and scratch the place whtire bi11 latent Itch
is located.''
For the convenience of giving a dose of a drug dilu­
ted to th3 lJorders of infinity, the processes directed br
Hahneman are vague and contradictory ; and hence it is
with marvellous consistency that he says " it is impossi­
ble to give doses too small." And lest any should com­
plain that this would imply that no medical virtue or po­
tency will remain after such unlimitl'd dilution, he ar­
gues the matter thus : " Let a substance be divided
into any number of parts ; its smallest imaginable part
will still contain something ef this substance, and can
therefore never become a nonentity ! " He admits, how­
ever, that the infinite nature of the dmg-virtues begins
to be developed at the eighteenth dilution, and gener·
ally reaches its beneficial dE'gree at the thirtieth dilution.
And to qnderstand this tedaoicality let it be remem-
9
98 H O M CE O P A T H J A .
bercd that if n single atom of sulphur, flint, or charcoal
be mixed in one hundred drops ofnlcoho!, and one drop
of this solution, so called, although the drugs ht>, a11 in
many cases ini;olublt>, mi:red in one hundred drop11 of
alcohol, we then have the first dilution ; one drop of
which is to be added to another cne hundred drops of
alcohol, for the second dilution, and so on to the eigh•
teenth dilution ; when the drug-virtues begin to be de­
Yeloped, and if carried to the thirtit>th dilution they are
nearer perfection. In accordance, however, with Hab­
neman's direction, some of his followers have had
the patience and skill to reduce a grain of sulphur, by
mi:rture in snow and spring-water one hundred drops at
a time, to the fifteen hundredth diluticn, carefully and
conscientiously giving each ofthe fifteen hundred phials
the two mystic " 1hake1 from above do1onwards," and
then proclaim tiery diatinct medical virtues in one drop
of this infintesimal solution of nothing, and Hahneman
endorses this miraculous result. But he objects to
transmitting the drug-preparations from place to place in
a fluid state, because of the changes they undergo by
the agitation they receive from long continued and ex­
ce11ive shaking. Hence it is that homreopathic physi­
cians ge�erally employ atoms or " pellets no larger
than hemp seed " moistened with their mystical solu­
tions of the centillionth part of nothing I For the manu­
facture of these atoms or pelle�, thi3 " great benef
actor
ofmankind " directs that two hundred sugar-pellets are
to be prepared by a confectioner from one grain of
starch and sugar ; although in anot�er volume of his
works, be think11 these would be too potent, and therefoN
Qrders three hundred to be made with one grain I In one
' edition, be directs one hundred sugar-pellets to be moi•t·
JI O l!ll (E O l' A T H J A. , 99
en�d with oac dro? of the developed drug solution ; but
in the next edition, he thinks this dose too large, even to
smell once a month, nod he prescribes thatthreeh undred
pellets be moistened with one drop I So, also, in regard
to the shaking of his solutions for the developement of
the powerful innate drug-virtues he says, that " of late
years be has been forced, by convincing experiments, to
reduce the ten ahaku formerly prescribed to two, with
the arm, from above downwards ! " And in every suc­
cessive volume Hahnaman has issued, it will be found'
that he is reducing his dose from nothing down to the
infin1esimal fraction of nothing. }"or example in 1816,
he says, that immediate and permanent benefit resulted
from one unmixed drop ofByonia juice. A few years af
­
ter he forbids giving more than one drop ofthe decillionth
solution ; which is one-tenth of a drop, divided by one
with sixty zeros, because ofthe danger ofa larger doae;
and twelve years later, he says the patient must not even
take a drop of this f
raction of nothing, but must smell
only of a sugar-pellet of the size of a hemp or poppy
seed, moistened with the decilliooth part of the same !
- and this smelling operation can only be safely re­
peated at intflrvals of days, weeks, or months !
Although utterly inconsistent with their doctrines,
bomreopathist. consider their atoms or pellets of sugar
and milk only as the menstrua or vehicles of the medi­
cinal solutions with which they are moistened ; but in it­
self they admit that the sugar-of-milk is equivalent to
nothing. Neverlheless,these pellets are ofinfinite impor·
tance to all homreopathic physicians ; and many milliom
ofthem are always kept among their stock in trade ; and
u their infintesimal doses are seldom to be given of
­
tener than °once in three, four, or six weeks, they are
100 U O M CE O P A T S I A •
obliged to seem to do something during these long inter•
vals, and these atoms ofsugar and milk are therefore given
by placing one upon the tongue daily ; and they can only
distinguish those which are moistenf'd with a hom<E<>-­
pathic dose of a drug by their being marked to be taken
once in fifteen, thirty, or 11ixty days. And when the im·
portance of doing nothing, while seeming to do some­
thing, is upon this system so apparent, we need not
marvel that Hahneman should say very piously, " for
this purpose, I consider sugar-of
-milk au invaluable
gift of God, and one of the greatest blessings ever be­
stowed on man."
But without dwelling longer on the Judicrous mon­
strosities ofthis humbug in detail, it is time to account
for the fact that men are found who not only possess
belief in this entire nonsense, but set themselves for
its defence ; and assume three sponsibility of the healtk
and lives of others while professedly devoted to the use
of hom<Eopathic doses of drugs, nnd relying upon their
curative powers. To admit that Hahneman himself be­
lieved in the doctrines he bas promulgated is more than
ordinary organs of gullibility can receive, were it not for
the evidences of insanity which charity can detect in
his writings. But this mantle will not cover all bis fol­
lowers ; for many of these are men whose sanity is un­
questionable, whatever may be thought oftheir can�our
or integrity.
The facts in most cases will be found to be these :
Hom<Eopatbic physician:1 are most frequently those
who have failed to acquire either fame or emolument in
the regular practice, and who have for the most pan
been unsuccessful in the treatment of diseases. Disal;l­
pointed men, whose sensibility is wounded by the wnot
H 0 lll 0: 0 I' A.•T U I A. • 101
of discernment in those around them, as exhibited in
their f
ailing to appreciate the pl'of
essional character they
claim for themselves, are apt to become disgusted with
their employment, and often become skeptics in pbysicks
as well as morals. Hence having Jost confidence in
the science of medicine by their own want of success,
they are ready to join any clique, or embrace any creed
by which they may gain fortune, or even notoriety.
While others impatient with the slow process of eleva­
tion to rank and consideration as physicians, by means
of patient industry and thankless labour, gladly avail
themselves of any shorter way to distinction which
opens before them. Any, or all of these classes may
be rationally supposed to be the ready victims of this
humbug ; and we shall seldom find an educated man
among the ranks of homceopa,thia, without learning
from his history, to which of these classes be truly ap­
pertains.
That there is no want of charity or courtesy in these
opinions, must be apparent ; for surely no medical man
who was every day witnessing multiplied instances of
his success in combating disease and restoring health
by allwopatbic practice, would be led to abandon his ac­
quirements both of learning and experience, and become
a pedler of pellets or atoms of sugar of milk ! · Much
less would be hazard his reputation and the lives ofhis
patients in acute and dangerous diseases, even by an ex­
periment at doing nothing for a single hour. Familiar
with the potency and success of his lancet in subduing a
pleurisy or frenzy, and having proven by numerous ex­
amples in himself and others the innocence aud safety
of depletion, as well as having witnessed so often the
dangerous and even fatal consequences of delay, or

U O M «E O P J. T B I A •
inefficiency under such circumstances, such a phy­
sician must be " allreopathically sick of idiot.ism " or
knavery, before he could be induced to listen to the ab­
surd and ridiculous doctrines of Hahneman, much lesa
adopt either bis theory or practice. These remarks ob­
viously apply to those men who have been regularly
inducted into the profession, and afterwards became
homreopathic practitioners ; for with barber and shoe­
maker, schoolmaster, and clerical quacks, who in six
weeks practice at triturating drugs, and making sugar­
pellets, turn homreopathists, we have nothing to do ; al­
though in perfect consistency with the dogmas of the
1ystem, they are better practitioners than the former,
since theiy are not encumbered with the " learned lum­
ber of the schools which has bee_n accumulating for two
thousand years," and against which Hahneman is ever
denouncing his anathemas.
A homreopathic physician is required to lay aside hia
learhing, if he has any, renounce all the sciences he may
have acquired, and sacrifice his reason, however he may
dispose of his conscience, and faithfully follow the cata­
logue of drug-sicknesses contained in his symptom­
book, always remembering that it is " impossible that his
dose should be too small." He is never to know what
disease his patient is labouring under ; but, in answer to
anxious inquiries on the subject, he is to look wise, and
only say he is sick ; or, in the language of Hahneman,
" it is a kind of such, or such a complaint." This si­
lence is all-important, for it would be inconvenient in all
cases to state with frankness, that a gentleman or lady
had the " lllh," and would be vastly inconvenient to add
that it was " hereditary," and still worse to call it '' la.
H O Jll CI! O P A T H J A . 103
lent," lest this might elicit inquiry how it was discover­
ablt', for
" The doctor's optics mu,t be keen,
Who sees what is not to be seen."
And yet, the catalogue of the complicated and ordinar1
diseases which Hahneman ascribes to hereditary laie11I
itch, will be found to include diseases of.every organ of
th� body, from the brain to the great toe.
But the disciples of Hnbneman, though thus silent in
answering questions, are nevertheless celebrated for
asking them. For as it is necessary before administer­
ing even an atom of sugar-of-milk to know all the symp­
tomatology with the greatest accuracy, including the
history of the patient's life, we are told that " the ad­
vantage of short visits and quickly writing a recipe,
cannot be reconciled with homceopathia." All the feel­
ings and complaints of the patient, whether b�dily or
mental, are to be diligently inquired into. Says Hah­
naman, " all the circumstances under which any com­
plaint arises or disappears, increases or diminishes,
- whether in motion or at rest, in certain situations and
postures, whether by warmth or cold, in the open air or
in the room ; by light, by noises, by talking, or thinking,
eating or drinking ; touch or pressure ; emotions of the
mind, or mental exertion, all must be- taken into ac­
count. Sensations on falling asleep, during sleep, and
on waking ; the posture during sleep. even the dreams,
and the kind of them, - whether of falling, or flying, of
fire, of noises, of hunger, of motion, of seeing frightful
objects, &c. , all belong to the image of the disease, and
any one of which may not unfrequently he the deciding
104 H O M <E O P A T H I A .
symptom. All such questions are to be put and an­
swered, the result being written down minutely to be
compared with the image in the gallery of drug.sick­
ness-symptoms, to discover the appropriate remedy.
Some idea of the critical character of these indispensa-
.
hie cross examinations, may be formed by enumerating
the different expressions of PAIN, which this " great
benefactor of mankind," declares " must be discrimina­
ted minulely, and arc indispensable for a correct diag­
nosis." Have you pain 1 In what part of the body 1
Is it 1imple, obtuse, pressing, compressing, bending,jam­
ming, pinching, culling, 1lingi11g, drawing, leaiing,
1hrugging, streaming, crawling, turning, boring, ltcilt­
ing, gnawing, eating, extending, 1cratching, knocking?
cJ-c. All these different kinds of pain are to be dis­
tinguished from each other, and one or more detected as
existing, before the remedy is to be selected.
But we forbear to enlarge on theseand kindred topics;
and now we suppose that the image of the disease, and
the likeness ef the drug-symptoms, are detected from
among the 1400 drug·symptoms which many of them
produce ; it then remains to decide, whether the patient
shall be directed to take the decillionth part ofa drop of
the·ceutillionth solution of a grain of sulphur, or be al­
lowed only to smell orice a pellet moistened with a quad­
rillionth solution of charcoal, by a single drop upon 300
of them, or whether a pellet of sugar-of-milk may be
gently placed upon his tongue every. �ine days ! Or
should a phial of the thirtieth solution of silex, which is
in1oluble, be given him, one drop of which is to he taken
every six weeks, smelling the cork once during the in­
terval ; lhe patient is cautioned against " shaking" the
phial, " lest its intensely raised energy " should destroy
1015 ·
life. Who can wondet' that an individual carrying such
a remedy home with him, should shudder lest by a single
11hake, the phial should blow him up by exploding in his
pocket. Nor ne�d we marvel at the influence upon
the imagination which thi
.
s humbug must produce upon
patients whose nerves are weak enough to listen to thu
oracular croakings of such an impostor, as is the miracle•
monger by whom they are gulled.
Notwithstanding these absurd and ridiculous moo·
strosities are but an infintesimal portion of the COD•
,
temptible humbugs with which the doctrines nnd prac•
lice of homreopathia abound, it is nevertheless true, that
in the nineteenth centu y, physicians of chnracter and
education are en.�aged avowedly in practice on this
principle: and find multitudes of patients who are clam•
orous encomiasts of the system and its practitioners.
That such are acquiring fame and emolument, as well
IJS certificates of their success in curing diseases by
thousands, is however by no means marvellous. Many
reasons may be assigned why such men obtain numer­
ous patients, and why they should be able to report
many cures. The proneness ofthe multitude to receive
every humbug with an eclat proportioned to its super­
natural and miraculous pretensions, need not be argued ;
• since but for this homreopathia had never mttde converts•
. Add to this the popular prejudice against mercut"y, by
reason of its empirical abuse, and · the outcry mado
against bleeding by the Thompsonians, who with their
illu11trious master most sagely argue, thnt " if God Al­
mighty intended any bloo<l to be taken out of the human
body, he would have left an opening somewhere on the
surface for the purpose, and a cork to stop it ; " and the
additional fact, tha.t all homooopathists unite with Hahne-
•
106 H O M IB O P A T il l A •
man in agreeing with these maxims of jgnorancc, and
availing themselves of all similar prejudices, while they
denominate all who practice allreopathically, the " mur­
derers of the human race." And we see still other
reasons of their sucr.ess in getting patients ; -in their
promises of infallible cure, in their mysterious remedies,
in the known repugnance of people generally to swallow
nauseous and biller medicines, and in the well-known
fact, that there are hundreds of people in every com­
munity, who are ever complaining, although without any
urgent symptoms of disease, and orten without any other
real ailment, other than in the imagination. This lattei
class are exceedingly numerous, and are only deterred
from submitting themselves to medical treatment peren­
nially, by the disagreeable nature of allreopathic medi­
cines. To such, the " new art ofhealing" is indeed a
desideratum, for there a:e no nauseous mixtures, or
bitter, pills to be taken ; no active or severe remedies to
be endured, for the pellets of sugar and milk are so in­
conceivably small, that they dissolve upon 1he tongue
in the effort to swallow them ; and in very many cuee
there is not even this inconvenience in being sick; for
to smell one of them 011 Fridays ! or to touch the nos­
trils with the cork out of the phial containing them, will
produce most marvellous curative eff
ects. These
and many similar reasons will account for the numer­
ous patients who are humbugged by homreopathic phy­
sicians .
Their cures, when they make any, are accounted for
thus : A large majority of their patients, are only sick
with imaginary diseases, and- hence imaginary remedies
will cure them, especially when they have strongfaith ; or,
as the Animal Magnetists call it, " robuate foi." A large
l
)I
H O M CJ! O P .l T H J A , 107
proportion ofthe remainder are suff
ering from those forms
of nervous diseases, scrofula and other hereditary and
constitutional maladies, which being absolutely incur­
able by human means, and in which the highest medical
skill consists in doing nothing, since all medicines do
but aggravate and prolong the symptoms. In such cases
homreopathists take the patients from the bands of the
quacks by whom they are only injured by medicine, and
as they do absolutely nothing with their infintesimal
doses of drugs, while seeming to do much, the patient
improves in their hands, by being left to the unassisted
\ powers of nature, -which is the true indication. Such '
patients are benefitted, but never cured ; and the benefit
they receive is wholly derived from their literally taking
no medicine, since the doses are reduced to the infinite
rart of nothing. All other cases among th�ir cures in
which sickness of any kind, acute or chronic, really
e:a:ists, and recovery tr.kes place while under this treat­
ment alone, would recover ifthey never saw a homceopa­
thic doctor, or tasted, or even smelled his pellets of
augar and milk. And that this is the case with many of
the milder forms of disease, every physician very well
knows ; and hence it is agreed on all bands, that in such
instances, medicines though gh·en by alllllopatbists are
often unnecessary. Still, physicians ofskill and honesty
only employ the mildest forms of medicine in these in­
atances, which in very many cases, are as innocent aa
bread pills, or as inert as homceopatbic doses of fiiDt or
charcoal. And it would be but silly trifling to argue
that the latter e:a:ert any inftuence upon the body or the
disease ; for it were easy to prove that if a homce<>pathic
dose of any drug, even the most potent, reduced aecun­
dum artam by the process of Hahnaman, were m�ed ia
every mouthful offood, and drink from the cradle to the
108 H O X CE O l' A T B I A •
grave, and the patient should live to the age of l\Iethu­
selnh, still he would not have taken, during nine centu­
ries, a sufficient quantity to produce the smallest percep­
tible or appreciable eff
ect, upon any living orgnn or tissue
of rhe body.
These remarks are intended to apply solet1 to the
homreopathic treatment, when rigidly and honestly ad­
hered to ; for it is not alleged that no cures are .per­
formed by those who pretend, for motives of imposition,
to practice homreopathically, and at the same time re­
sort to allreopathia in every case of genuin� disease by
bleeding, emetics, calomel, and blisters, as many of
them do, and only use the infintesimal doses, when
" there is nothing the matter." That there 11re such
professed homreopathists is well known, as any one may
satisfy himself by sendingfor one of them, when suffer­
ing under acute disease. While there are other" base
enough to " run an accommodation line," by offering
the patient his choice either to treat him by the regular
practice, or homreopathically if he prefers it, and prom­
ising him that he can be cured either way. Such cha­
racters often make converts 1o homreopathia, by treating
him rationally, and at the same time superadding a taste
or smell of a pellet of sugar and milk, and then dog­
matically assuring the patient that his recovery is attrib­
utable wholly to th� latter. These are only a few of the
" tricks of the trade," which are becoming too notorious
to admit of denial.
But the most wonderful secret of homreopathin, and
by which Hahneman and his followers have alway•
made the most of reputation and money, consists in the
prc"entifle powers of infintesimal doses. In times of
prevalent epidemics, every homreopathist hs a sove·
reign specific, which he persuades every body to take,
l
B O M <B O P A T B J A. 109
while in health, as a protection from the attack. When
11Carlet fever appears in the city, men, women, and
children, are importuned to take one drop of a solution
ofbelladonna, reduced to the " frontier of infinity,'' which
will prevent an attack. This is a most profitable spec­
ulation ; for not one in a hundred will take the disease,
even if they take nothing ; and when those who use the
infallible preventive, suffer an attack, the homreopatbist
ascribes it to having taken too large a drop, or one drop
too much, or to the bottle having had " one shake " too
many, by which its " intensely raised energy," has been
potenzized, .or some other device of this systematized
humbug. The like fraud is adopted when influenza, or
cholera, or any other epidemic, is indicated ; and multi­
tudes who are not predisposed to the disease, and would
not have taken it, are humbugged into' the belief that
they owe their exemption from disease and death, wholly
to having smelt a pellet of sugar-of-milk, moistened
with an atom ofcamphor ; the minuteness of which no
arithmetic citn compute, since " it is impossible that the .
dose can be too small."
Such, theA, is homreopathia ; a greater humbug than
witchcraft, or any other form of imposture, by which
mankind have ever been gulled ; and a more impudent
and shameless form of quackery than was ever con­
cocted by anycharlatan practitioner in " roots and yarln,''
with whom our world was ever cursed. That it should
assume the garb of science, and, still \l'.Orse, that of
piety, is among the secrets of its gullibility. And the
fact that men of sense and character should become its
dupes, is one of the most striking exhibitions of intel­
lectual stupidity.and moral obliquity which the history of
fanatioism itselfcan furnish.

Ul'IDER this head there are so many •od so various
1enera and species belonging to the same order, that it
ia convenient to include them together under this general
title, rather than give to each of these humbugs a dis­
tinctiOO. to which they are not . entitled, by separate
coDSi.<lel'lltion.
The term quackery baa been variously defined ; liut
perhaps the definition by the celebrated Dr. Parr, is the
most qnexceptionable. He says " the term quack, is
applied to every prttctitioner, who, by pompous preten·
sicml't mean iosinuatioos, and indirect promises, endeav­
wra to obtain the confidence to whic,h neither succeaa
nor experience entitles him." In other words, every
l
I
Cl V A C: & S & Y 1 1' G & N .& R A L . 01 1 1
practitioner, wbetlaer educated ·or not, who attempts to
practi.le imposture of any kind, ia justly deaominated a
quack ; although tile epitbet is often restricted withia
narrow limits, and is attached ordinarily only to tbot1e
ignorant and impudent mountebanks, who, for purpose•
ofgain, make pretensioos to the healing art, without any
acquaintance with the,structure or functions ofthe human
body ; and alike destitute. of all knowledge of the dis­
eases they profess to cu� or the remedies they employ.
The fraternity may be every where recognised by their
_pompous pretensions ; their slanderous insinuations, and
their infallible promises ; and it is hµmiliating to confesa
th11.t these attributes too often appear under the shelter
of a diploma. It is for this reason, thai this testimonial
of professional character has ceased to be, as it ought,
a passport to confidence and respe�t,- not becau1e of
any palpable criminality on the part ofthose to whom the
bu_siness of medical education is assumed, - but be.
cause ofthe "love ofmoney, which is the root ofall evil."
The popularity and emolument which public gullibility
enables every impostor and humbug to aoquire, fumisbee
a powerful mercenary motive to quackery in medicine,
which some who have been regularly inducted into the
profession have found themselves unable to resist. For
while the reputable young physician can only gain !'
competence after years of toil and patient industry,
whatever be bis scholastic acquirements ; .iie most con­
temptible humbug, the most barefaced charlatan and
mountebank, leaps at once into both f
ame and fortune.
So that it is now well understood, that any man may grow
rich by imposture in our prof
ession, ifhe will only consent
to pay the price, by sacrificing character, conlcience, and
decency ; and consenting to become a q11aci.
111 'l u A c It & a 1' 1 1'1 G & 1'I & a ... L .
The word quack has alway�been uodentood tu apply
to a man or woman who, as Nicholson says. " for tlae
good of the public, and �y tBe blessing of Heaven, un­
dertakes by his pills, powders, balsams, potions, or tricks.
to cure all disorders.'' Thus, ignorance and blasphemy
1111ite in picking the pockets, and ruining the constitu­
tions of thousands of credulous people. The pretensioa
that any one medicine is a certain cure for any one dis­
order, is next to absurd ; much , mere ridiculous is it
then to suppose that-any one medicine will remove all
kinds of complaints. Every medicine possesses active
properties, or it does not : if it be active, it must be
dangerous to apply it indiscriminately to persons of every
age, without regard to their habit of living. An active
medicine which might be very useful in strengthening a
debilitated constitution, would be highl
y injurious if ex­
hibited in an acute rheumatism, or other inflammatory
disorder, and 1'ic11 11ersa. Consequently the application
of the s�me remedy in all cases, can hardly fail of being
fatal to some. Should the medicine be inactive, and
· inert, which happily is ofien the case, it can be of no
other utility than to work upon the patient's imagination,
and amuse him while his pocket is picked."
Among rude and barbarous nations, charms, incanta­
t�ona and amulets, have ever been invogue, to appease the
wrath of malignant spirits, and frighten them out of the
diseased patient ; and they have often acquired a tem­
porary sway over credulous minds, omong people of a
higher character, as in the instance of the Abracadabra,
ofthe ancient Greeks. for curing fevera ; and the equally
unmeaning word Abracalan" of the Jews, for other dis·
orders. The more polished polytheists,. who failed io
their supplicatioos to Apollo and Esculapius, seem to
•
Q U A C K E R Y I N O E N & R A. L . 1 1 3
laave partaken ofthe same superstition ; and hence they
sacrificed to the Dii inferiores ; and even Paracelaua, in
the sixteenth century, taught that the devil 1hould, in
prudence, be invoked to cure a desperate malady. -
Witchcraft having been employed in all ages to cure,
diseases, as well as to inflict them, is another speciea of
quackery ; and among the most enlightened nations of
the earth, this humbug prevailed as late as the begining
of the eighteenth century ; and all who dared to doubt
it were regarded as atheists. And as we shall presently
discover, very many species of modem quacks, practiH
impostures little short of witchcraft, in absurdity and
wickedness, and they meet with a success which provea
the potency of their spell in this age of humbug. .
Paracelsus, the ancient prince of quacks, waa ren­
dered so illustrious in his day, that he was honoured by
many other names,-Aurelius, Philippus, Theophrastu1,
Bomhastus de Hohenheim, were included among them ;
and one of these names so eminently characteristic o(
the tribe of Bombaat, is supposed to have been the ori­
gin of this term. After bis early death, notwithstanding
his boasted pretensions to confer immortality by hie
" golden drop," or elixir of life ; the next distinguished
sect of quacks, were denominated Astrological, since
they classed diseases and remedies under the several
1igns ofthe zodiac, designating them as solar and lunar ;
and giving elaborate prescriptions in regard to the ae­
cendency of particular planets, under whose influence,
the herbs and plants to be used as medicines,'were te
be pthered. Indeed the mystical ceremonies with
which the · collection of remedies was accompanied,
comprise many volumes. Some plants are only to be
plucked at �e riling of the dog-atar, when neither na
lo«'
•
1 14 � U A C K E B T 1 1' G E N E R A L .
nor moon shine, while others are to be cot with a golden
knife, only when the moon is six daya old." While oth­
ers, we are told, must only be gathered in the night ; aad
as it is dangerous to pluck them, " a string must be
mstened to it, and a hungry dog tied thereto, who being
allured by the smell of roaste4 flesh set before him, may
pluck it up by the roots."
Next came the t1egetable quacks, and these followed
by the animal quacks, both of whom denounced the
Mineral quacks who had preceded them, and sometimes
combined their remedies, as in the celebrated vegeto·
animal oil of swallows, which w11.s a sovereign remedy,
and was prepared by compounding twenty diff
erent
herbs, with twenty li1!e BWallows, to be well beaten
together in a mortar. And the animal quacks performed
the most wonderful cures for centuries, w.ith medicinea
prepared from the raspings of a human skull unburied ;
from the moss growing on the head ofa lhiefwho has
been hanged and left in the air ; powder of a mummy ;
the river of frogs ; the blood of weasels ; and the famous
ointment made of sucking whelps, the marrow of a stag,
and the thigh-bone of an ox.
But although such were the str�nge and mystical fea­
tures of ancient qnackery, yet many of the modern hum­
-bugs in this department, are equally superstitious and
absurd. Hume has long ago truly remarked, that man­
kind are constantly deceived by the same tricks, played
over and over again. Human credulity indeed seems
wholly incurable ; and, in spite of all warning, we see
one generation after another, with their eyes wide open,
run into the same gulf of fraud, quackery, and impos-
11ue, s_wallowing the same humbug, in somt; new form,
in almost every successive century.

All the world has heard of the " taclt11 regalia,'' or
the touching quackery, by which so many kings of the
earth have been celebrated ; - the awful solemnity with
which so ma�y sovereigns touch for the cure of scrofu­
la, or king's evil. Charles the second touched 23,62 1
parsons for this disease, in five years ; but although
Queen Anne, and many other kings and queens of Eng·
land, and France, continued the royal experiment, yet
the superstition bas long since been exploded ; and in­
stead of tbJ touch of the sovereign, the same virtue has
been since derived from the hand of a banged felon ;
and in England, which is the paradise of quackery, this
latter remedy is often applied for under the gallows.
A late writer on the quackery whrch abounds in the
city of London, attempts a classification of these hum­
bugs, by enumerating twelve species of quacks : 1st.
the astrological : - 2d. vegetable : - 3d. animal : -4th.
mineral : -5th. magnetical : - 6th. chemical : - 7th.
and 8th. rubbing and touching : - 9th. cosmetic : -
10th. capillary : - 1 1th. tonsorial : - 12th. blacking.
But in New-York, which is the London of America, we
are obliged to claim great numerical superiority in the
classification of our quacks ; for we have not only im­
ported all those mentioned as flourishing in London, but
we have many more of domestic manufacture. In ad­
dition to the twelve classes, we have 13th. pilular
quacks ; 14th. steamers ; 1 5th. dental ; 16th. ocular ;
1 7th. �firmary and dispensary quacks ; 18th. thumping ;
1 9th. pawing ; 20th breathing ; 21st. dyspeptic ; 22d.
liver ; ·23d. bowels ; 24th. lungs ; 25th. skin ; 26th.
worm ; 27th. children's ; · 28th. females ; 29th. urine ;
30th, rain-water ; 31st. bone-setting ; 32d. Indian ; 33d.
botanical ; 34tb. secret quacks ; besides a multitude of
other classes which no man can number.
1 16 Q U J. C II: E R Y I N G S N S R J. L .
· The most common and prevalent form of this hum­
bug in New-York, and elaewhere, is seen in the numer­
ous advertisements with which the newspapers are filled,
in which men, arrogating the title of doctors, and often
appending the . mystic letters M. D. to their names
when they have no claim, honorary, or otherwise, to this
distinction ; announce the establishment of an office, or
dispensary, or infirmary, for some single disease or class
of diseases, in which " pompous pretensions " are ex­
pressed or implied, with the design of humbugging the
public into the belief, that they possess exclusive llod
superior knowledge in the medical treatment of those .
diseases, and often accompanied with reports of cases,
certificates of cures, and sometimes affidavits containing
" mean insinuations," and " indirect promises " ofinfalli-
ble cure.
.
. These examples are sufficiently notorious to be f
a­
miliar to · all ; and they are not confined to the lock�
hospitals, and other institutions for secret diseases and
remedies, for the encouragement of licentiousness, else
they might be. left to wallow in their filth and infamy,
and fester amid their ill-gotten gains. But in addition
to these, we . have infirmarie·s for almost every dif!ease,
and for every organ of the body ; and often with an array
of the names of physicians, as attending and consulting,
who thus degrade themselves, and dishonour the pro­
fenion. Infirmaries for the eye, for. the ear, for the
liver, for the lungs, for. the bowels; for dyspepsia, for
f
ever, for surgical diseases, for female complaints, for
children, for the skin, and last not least, for all secret­
diseases. Now it is plain, that in each of these kindred
examples, whether caHed public or private infirmaries,
thoao who advertise them, do by this act, make preten-
.Q. U A C IL& R Y I N G E !'f E R A L . 1 17
•ions to exclusive and superi�r acquaintance with the re­
spective diseases they profess to treat, which they and
the profession alike understand to bei,n the generality of
cases, utterly fictitious. They are all alike., pretenders
to secret remedies, or nostrums of some kind ; and they
aim to impose on the public, by this false insinuation,
either directly or indirectly set forth in their circulars,
signs, handbills, or advertisement. From this condem­
nation no,exception can be made, except in the instances
of public charities.
It is scarcely necessary to say, that no worthy mem­
ber of the profession claimiug to be enlightened and
liberal, is at liberty to conceal any remedy for disease,
or curative process which can benefit mankind ; nor is it
ever done but at the forfeiture ofhis character. Hence
all who either by direct profession, or mean insinuation,
pretend to the exclusive possession of such nostrum,
, are defacto quacks, and the gullible public who patron­
ize them, are the victims of humbug. The multiplied
instances of this form ofquackery need not be individu­
ally particularized, aince the imposture has been so
often and so justly castigated, that none but those who
are beyond the reach of these strictures, need suff
er by
such empiricism.
But there are some other species, which from their
iinblushing impudence, and boasted success, are entitled
to distinct notice. The tribe of homreopathists' have
been disposed of in another chapter ; and the seet of
Thomp1onians may now be introduced to the reader.
A few years since, a certain Dr. Thompson, so called,
published a , book, designed to make " every man his
own doctor," containing a new theory of diseases, with
their treatment, and for which a patent was obtained
1 18 Q u A c J[ s a y 1 1( G s 1' s a . L .
wader the great 111eal of tile U. 8. The doctrine ef the
HCt, ao far aa it ia intelligible, aeema to be, that cold and
heat are the grand agents in producing a1 weH u in
curing diseases ; and the remedies chiefly relied upon
are, first, steaming with the vapoor of water poured upon
bot atones, until universal perspiration is induced, where­
by the cold is drytien out through the pores ofthe skin,
and then by deluging the body with cold water, the pores
are shut, and the cold is thus kept out. Second, enor­
mous doses of lobelia inflata, or indian tobacco, which
is both emetic and narcotic. Third, cayenne pepper,
given alone, or in combination with myrrh, cloves, ginger,
and other heating drugs, in the form oftinctures, bitten,
·or teas, with the view of regulating the conflict between
beat and cold, which is supposed to be the cause of
disease.
The simplicity of the theory and practice of Tbomp­
aonianism is such, that any simpleton, by the payment of
20 dollars for a patent-right, may be fully armed and
equipped for " the '(Ork of death ;" and besides all the
" laming " imparted to him, he will be supplied with
lobelia, bayberry, and other " yarba ; " '
and the entire
library of Thompsonianism, consisting of one book I will
be thrown into the bargain. To become· a doctor there­
fore upon this system, requires no kind of knowledge
either of the.-flumnn body, its diseases, or its remedies,
nor indeed any other qualification than to be a fool ; -for
it is agreed on all hands, that any literary or medical
knowledge is only in tbe' way. So that a man can read
this one little book of Samuel Thompson, without spel­
ling more than half the words, he is just f
ool enough to
make a doctor on this plan ; and for great succe• in
gulling the public, all that is requisite is that be add

Some farther idea of the vileness and miscbiefa oi
this imposture may be gathered from the fact, that their
different· medicines are known by the classical aod eu­
pbonoua names of " acreui-ougur! ram-cat ! and laeU.
acraper! "
This stupendous humbug baa · gained converts io
various parts of our country, although the state and city
of New-York is perhaps the most extensive field of the
operations of the sect. The number of lives which
have been sacrificed by the steaming· process, and the
violence of the -external and internal treatment to which
this sect of quacks resort. has again and again been
brought before the. civil and criminal tribunals. The
systematic arrangements for clandestinely murdering
ita victims, may be seen in the fact, that as nunieroua
courses of the steaming and medicine are called for; in­
firmaries are established, in which patients are received
both for boarding and physic, where they are succes11ive·
ly taken care of on the Thompsonian plan, until they
either run away before they have become its victims, or
are quietly buried from the infirmaries ; without, in the
general, having the benefit of the clergy, or of die
coroner's inquest ; lo which last, they are justly entitled,
aeeing that they come to their death by violence. At
the present hour, one of this fraternity is in " durance
vile," convicted by a jury of this city, on the charge of
manslaughter, in a case so 6agrant that it could not a.
cape tho notice of the law, though the victim had been
snugly en1conced six f
eet below ground, for some days
before the outrage became the subject of investigation.
Whether, as heretofore, the " glorious uncertainty ofthe
law " shall, as in other cases, suff
er this Thompsonian to
120 Cl U A C IC l: R Y 1 1'( G l: l'( E R A L .
escape the penalty due to his c:ift'ence, remain• to be
aeen.
Next to this fonn of medic:il humbug may be named,
the innumerable kinds of pill• which are maeuf
actured
by cart-loads ; some of them by steam process, and
which it seems are sold and swallowed, to an extent
which would be incredible, if we had no other evidence
of public gullibility. Some of these are imported by
ship-loads from foreign colleges of health, while millions
ofthem are made by Indian doctors, or " root and yarb "
doctors, or their ""grandfathers and grandmothers ; " -
some are " life pills, or chamomile pills, or female pills,
bilious and anti-bilious pills," and each and all are re­
ported to have cured all manner of incurable diseases ;
and are accompanied by columns, and even volumes of
certificates and affidavits of'their wonder-working pow·
ere. Some of these1lre good for the " constitution, or
that t11h.icl& comtitule1; " while others are " sovereign
for the blood." Some are to be taken by doz�s or
scores at a _time, and warranted to be innocent, if the
patient will only take enough of them at a dose ; and
there is no danger whatever of taking too many, as they
can be made by the steam-engine faster than they can
be swallowed. If the patient finds himself worse after
taking any of these pills, he has only to take more,
doubling the quantity every time, and the cure will soon
be finished ; for should he die, it only proves that he has
not lived long enough to swallow a sufficient number of
pills ; for so long as he can take pills, he cannot die if
he should try. And the only means by which a man
can escape, therefore, from this troubleso� world, if
these doctors or their grandf
athers report truly, is to
Q. U A C K E R Y I N G E N l!. R A L . 121
cease to take the pills, since they " infallibly cure all in­
curable diseases."
Such are the astounding pretensions ofthis pill-making
humbug, and yet popular gullibility continues to furnish
victims to every successive imposture, notwithstanding
the glaring character of the stupid delusions, by which
these mountebankA perpetuate the deception. Some of
them expend thousands of dollars annually in advertise­
ments, on the principle avowed by some of them as the
secret of their success,-" any kind of pills will sell, if
you will ,only advertise them enough," - and in a few
years, the emolument derived from some of the vilest
and most mischievous of these humbugs is known to
have amounted to an ample fortune ; while it has been
confessed, that the cost of printing advertisements,
handbills, and pamphlets, has been ten times that of the
humbug itself, and all other expenses attending upon
its manufacture, ·sale, and the support of agents and
venders. And this has been the case when the comp�
sition of the pills bas been perfectly understood by every
medical man in the country ; and when the mischievous
effects upon the health of those who swallowed them,
has yielded a rich harvest to the physicians who have
been called to subdue the diseases waich were the con.
sequence of the pills.
Perhaps no more memorable instance of the succe11
ofquackery in New-York can be adduced, than the tribe
of dyspeptic doctors, with which the city has been visited
within a few years. 'fhe habits of high living, gluttony,
intemperance, and sensuaJ indulgence, in which all
classes of the population have been growing worse and
worse, have resulted in the almost universal prevalence
of indigestion ; to every variety of which the name dya-
1 1
122 Q V A C IC S R T I If 0 S If g a A L •
pepsia has been stupidly and indiscriminately applied ;
and to suff
er from this disease has become so fashion­
able, that scarcely any one has escaped its symptoms,
except those whom poverty, or imprisonment, has con­
demned to short allowance. Quacks have accordingly
availed 'themselves of the existence of this almost uni­
versal disease, and many of them have amassed wealth
in a few months, by the discove1 y ofa universal remedy
for this malady. The most �uccessful of these may be
,
called the " thumping quacks," who, professing to cure
dyspepsia without medicine, for the fee of fifty or nve
hundred dollars, according to the length of the patient's
purae, always paid in advance, and administered under
Rn oath of secrecy, have succeeded in humbugging a
multitude. The chief practitioner in this line, who bas
many less successful imitators, made some 30,000 dol­
lars i.n a few months, ;with his so\·ereign remedy. It
consisted in " th.umping" the stomach and abdomen ;
and sometimes " kneading " with the knuckles, and
teaching the patient how to expel flatulence from the
stomach, by " squeezing " upon the epigastric region
,
and belching up the gases, which the fermentation of the
food had occasioned. The myRtery of his success con­
sisted in the fact, that no gentleman or lady, after having
been befooled into an oath of secrecy and gulled of an
enormous fee, for being taught this " thumping, knead­
ing, and squeezing process," was at liberty to expose
the humbug ; but on the contrary, they were willing that
others should become its victims ; so that neither could
�ff
ord to laugh at the other, after having been exposed to
the equally ludicrous treatment of this thumpiug quack.
Nor was it until the gullible portion of the public had
been used up, an� fees bl(Came so " few 1md far be-
Cl U .&. O JC l!. ll Y 1 1" G "B N. l!. B A. L . 123
tween," that u Othello's occupation wail gone,'' that the
whole art and mystery was published in a book, when
forthwith all the patients r(llapsed into dyspeptics, their
oaths being cancelled, and · the humbug forthwith ex•
pired.
It is not only vain, however, while the reign ofpopu­
lar delusion lasts, for the guardians ofthe public health
to remonstrate against this, or any other form of quack­
ery; for the reason that physicians are disfranchised from
expressing an. opinion on a subject, in relation to which
they only are competent to judg�, by the stupid impeach­
ment of their motives which they invariably suff
er�
But those who are the best informed of the facts in the
ease know very well, that it is never
.
for the pecuniary
intMest of any member of the profession, to oppose any
form of quackery, since, withimt an exceptiou, they are
..all tributary to his interest, and must continue to be so,
while they.continue to be successful,- If medical men
were actuated by sordid and mercenary motives, they
would exult in every new and successful species of
quackery, since even if it were one which might be use­
ful, if employed with discrimination ; yet because indis­
criminately used, it must infallibly increase and multi­
ply the number of the sick, and the tees of the faculty.
It is therefore contrary to their interest, that any eff
ort
is ever made to gain the public ear by remonstrance
against the experiments of ignorance and folly which ,
quack-doctors are ever performing upon the public
health. - · That they should not be believed when they -
make the affirmation is at once the fruit and the proof
ofthe dominion of humbug.
But it were an endless task to apecify the rnultita- ,
dinous variety ofmedieal quackery, 'whiob abounda in
124 Q U A O X S R T J N G S l!f S & A L •
New-York, and elaewhere, since tbe supply will keep
pace with the demand. · And until the public shall be
aufticiently enlightened to protect themselves from im­
position, neither the remo!lstrances of the faculty, nor
the restraints of the laws in relation to quackery, will
ever arrest or diminish the evil. All the prof
ession can
do is at the hazard of encountering tbe vituperation of
the ignorant, and the interested,' to release themselvea
of the responsibility they would otherwiae bear, by
timely and faithful remonstrance. The people regard
it among their vested rights to buy and swallow suck
physick, as they in their sovereign will and pleasure,
shall determine ; and in this free country,the democracy
denounce all restrictions upon quackery, as wicked
monopolies for the benefit of physicians. Be it so, if
the democracy please, so long as it can be shown tba.t
the faculty have individually and colleclively done what
they can to give the warning, which i11 a duty they owe
to themselves, whether the public will hear or forbear.
Is it not passing strauge, that while the populace are
almost universally sufficieotly well inf
ormed to select
for their artists, mechanics, and even labourers, those
only who have been trained for their respective kinds
of business, they should betray such reckless indiffer­
ence in committing their health and lives to the hazard­
ous experiments of ignorance, and even stupidity itse1f.
Who, for instance, would commit the repair of bis
watch to the blacksmith who 11hoes his horse1 What
man would go to sea in the ship built by his tailor 1 or
who would wear the eoat made by bis barber ? And yet
there are those who will entrust the care of their sto­
machs, liver, lungs, and brain, to men whom they would
not trust, becal,lse of their profound stupidity, either to
Q U .l C It I: R Y I N G E N Ji: Jl .l L . 125
.
repair their shoes, or mend their breeches. Any clown,
who has failed in bis appropriate employment of teach:.
ing ch�ldren their A, B, C., or digging ditches, or l!aw­
ing wood, or mending shoes, may succeed in acquiring
popularity, and even· wealth, by announcing himself a
· quack doctor ! The more ignorant. of the human body,
its diseases, and the remedies be uses, the better for his
purpose, since it only proves that " the weak things of
the world are to confound the wise." And if he l\wre
knavery .enough to f
eign a special call from � "'
the work.of doctoring ; or profess to have receive11 .
" gift of h�aling," either by a dream or vision ; or by
learning from an Indian medicine-man the use of roots
and yarbs ; or by being the seventli son of a seventh
daughter ; or, what is still better, ifhe sryle himself a sur­
geon-barber to some foreign king, emperor, or royal
family, from London or Paris, his opinion will be
sought, and his pbysick swallowed by thousands who
are labouring under intricate and complicated diseases
of vital organs, which demand the most enlightened
and scientific disc!imination, to afford any hope of re­
covery. And amazing as it may seem, it js neverthe­
less true, that these vile and inf
amous impostors will
demand and rec�ive ail amount in fees, and these in ad­
vance, which would subject a regularly educated physi.-
ciao to a criminal prosecution for the crime of extor­
tion and swindling, even should he restore his patient
to life and health, by laborious art, arid a consummate
exhibition of science and skill.
·
In truth, there is no prof
ession under heaven, in which
imposture and humbu g are so certainly successful as in
medicine ; though in none are such frauds so easy of de­
tection, with an ordinary degree of discernment. Ifa.

attempt a cause involving bis property or reputation by

yet the great mass of the people confide in time ofsick­

their remedies be!ong to the animal, vegetable, or mine­
ral kingdom. Nor do they discover their delusion in
too many instances, until both health and life are forfeit­
ed, and they become the silly victims of some sense.

Such are the facts abounding and accumulating in
our midst ; and when one form of quackery by its fatal
mischief
s becomes detected and annihilated, another
quickly succeeds it with the like history and results.
Meanwhile, the public become no wiser by the experi­
ence of the past, but persist in yielding up fresh vie·

Oun definition of a humbug, by the use of its synonyme
impoature, will protect us from the imputation of apply­
ing this epithet to temperance, or to temperance so­
cieties, as the quellf
ying term ultra prefixed will con­
clusively show. Indeed, the predominant motive for in­
troducing this chap�er:bas been to protectthegreat Tem­
perance Reformation from being identified with the doc­
trines and measures which are justly thus denomina­
ted. But as in successive chapters a number of species
belonging ta this genus, " ULTRA. " will receive a dis­
tinct notice, the following preliminary inquiries, and ob-
1errations, are �ommended to the iotelligeot reader, as
they will be important to be remembered as we proceed.
What is ultraiam l and Who are the ultraa l are
questions which ,re frequently proposed, and as often
128 U L T R A • T E M P E R A. 1' C E .
remain unanswered. Every body is talking of the td­
traa, whose folly seems to be univer1Jally deplored, and
yet it is an epithet which no one is found willing to bear,
as his just and appropriate designation, however readily
he employs the term in his vocabulary, when speaking
of his neighbours. Indeed, the frequent occasions upon
which this word is employed in public discussioos,
whether upon politics, morals, or religion, would seem
to indicate that the present is neither the iron, the bra­
zen, the silver, nor the golden age, but strictly, and em­
phatically, the age ofvltraism! The justice and pro:.
priety of thi!J indication can only be estimated when we
have distinctly and definitively settled the important
questions at the head of this paragraph.
It is true that the signification of those English com­
pound words, to which the Latin prefix ultra is added,
as ultra-marine, ultra-mundane, &c., might be supposed
to furnish a sufficient definition ; and as these are found
in our English Dictionaries, the word ought to be suf
­
ficiently intelligible, even to those who are ignorant of
the Latin language, to which it belongs ; and it is on
this hypothesis, that it has remained untranslated in
common parlance. But as it has now become Angli­
cised by frequent use, it must be °'ving to its pe.rver­
sion and misapplication, that its ambiguity of meaning
continues, and to rescue it from such al1use is the ob­
ject of the present paper.
It would be a work of supererogation to remind the
reader that the word vltra is a preposition in our own as
well as in its orignal tongue, and uniformly signifies be­
yond. Stili, however, like all other prepositions, it only
shows the " relation ofwords," while abstractly it sig.
nifies nothing. The word beyond, standing alone and
'
\
U L 'l' R A. • T & � P B R A !I C J!.. 129
unconnected, is unintelligible, nor can its precise mean•
ing be ascertained in any given case, without a know•
ledg� of the persons, things, or subjects to which it re·
fore. And hence, for convenience sake, it is com•
monly united directly with another word, to which it i1
applied with the powers of an adjective, as in the fol·
lowin� examples, ultra-llemocracy - ultra-Episcopalian
- ultra-Calvinist-ultra-Protestant - ultra-temperance
- ultra-abolitionist, &c. In such examples as these,
the meaning of the prefix is obvious, however the ap·
plication of the epithet may be disowned, as it univer·
aally is by those to whom it is applied. It obviously
1ignifies one who goes beyond the true character of a
democrat, an Episcopalian, a Calvinist, &c. .
But still, when used as a term of reproach, or at least
of di11respect, it is important aud desir�ble that there
1hould be some standard or rule, by which the measure _
of orthodoxy on these several topics, is to be adjudica·
ted, else it still remains equivocal, and is exceedingly
liable to be misapplied. As, for example, some men
have so much reverence for antiquity, that they indis·
criminately condemn all improvement, innovation, and
reform in ancient opinions or practice, by denominating
1uch novelty as ultra ; that is, beyond what they have al­
ways held sacred. While others adopt the opposite ex­
treme, and are ever seeking " some new thing ;" and their
rage for innovation leads them to reject every doctrine
or usage of our ancestors, for no other reason than that it
is too antiquated, and such apply the term ultra to every
thing which has any claim to be old-fashioned. While
numerous examples may be found, ·mustrating the truth
of the proverb, •• &ery tnan haa a PoPE in hia own bel­
ly." Those of this class who arrogate infallibility to
180 t7 L T JU. • T & JI P B R A If C E .
all their own opinions, call every man ultra wbo goes
beyond them oo any topic, being fully persuaded that they _
stand on the zenith of perf
ection, and constitute the
very personification of ne pl!" ultra, in science, �orals,
and religion.
But while there are many illustrations ofthe misappli­
cation of this signifi
,
cant word, still there are much more
numerous instances, in which "it is appropriate and use­
ful ; nor is there any conceivable danger ofabusing the
term, if those who use it can but agree to adopt some
common standard, to tranticend which, shall by unani­
mous consent be catted ultraism, whether in ourselves
or others. Such a standard, we humbly submit, is found
io the Book of Revelotion, which is " the infallible rul�
of faith and practice " in the creed of Christianity. And
we propose thot he who becomes in his own conceit, or
in bis philo10phy, pbilanthrophy, or religion, either wise1'
or better than the Bible, shall henceforth be denomina­
ted an ultra, and bis principles and practice be ranked
as ultraiam.
Having reached this ultimatum, and erected our stand­
ard, we now propose to " try the apirits " of a few ofthe
pseudo· reformers of this �ge of ultraism ; and we select
for our purpose three of the Jlntiu, viz. : the Anti-In­
temperance, Anti-Slavery, and Anti-Popery ; or, ns we
shall call them in our philosophy, the Ultra-Temper­
once, Ultra-Abolition, Ultra-Protestantism, and to these
we add Ultra-Sectarianism.
And first, we inquire who are they in the ranks of the
Tempe1·ance enterprise, who nre justly cborgeable with
being ultras, end whose creed aff
ords exemplification of
ultraism, io principle and practice 1 And here, to prll­
vent misapprehension, we premise, that. io the doctrine
U L T R A. • T & '.fll P B Jt A. N C E . 131
of " total abstinence from all intoxicating liquers as a
beverage," as inculcated by the enlightened friends of
the great and good reformation, now in progress in our
own and other lands, no semblance ofultrai6m can be
found, however ofien and strenuously it has beenalleged.
And we deem it a sacred duty to appeal to our infallible
standard, the Bible, as affording an ample vindication,
and one which has never been successfully gainsaye-0.
Nor, ind�ed, can any man with the Bible in his hand,
hesitate to admit, so long as " intoxicating liquor"
originates, promotes, and perpetuates drunkenness, and
its kindred enormitil:'s, and dest,roys the bodies and souls
of men ; that it becomes a duty of universal and perpe­
tual obligation, that men should resolutely abstain from
the " manufacture, traffic, and use ,; of that article, in
every form " a11 a be,·erage." Not that it can be proved
by express statute, that to take a glass of wine, or a sin.
gle drop ofardent spirits, under any circumstances, is·sin
against God, for this would not be in accordance with
the mode of Divine legislation. It cannot be proved
that " killing " is a sin under any circumstances, though
the commandment is so explicit, " Thou shalt not kill."
And it is because the Creator has never legislated in any
caae independent of circumstances, that His law is
" good and right, and sure, and perfect." The Divine
legislation adapts itself to all possible circumstances,
and therefore never predicates guilt, but where it is infal­
libly merited.
Having premised thus much, we proceed to the in­
quiry proposed, and lay down the following position, _
viz. : that all who maintain the doctrine, that " to use
intoxicating drink in any quantity, or under any circum­
lia.11Cea. is morally toro11g.'' as they go beyond the Bible,
132 U L T R. A • T E M P .I. R. A N C g ,
are justly to be styled ultraa, and all the measures adopt­
ed under this creed merit the name of ultrailm. By
this aame stancJard, therefore, we affirm that the ptopo·
sitioo to change the element used in the sacrament of
the Lord's supper, by substituting some other symbol of
the Saviour't1 blood, in the place of the '' fruit of the
Yine," on the pretext that the wine employed is intoxica·
ting in its nature, is truly denominated ultrailf7I, since this
also goes beyond the Bible. And the same may be
said in relation to the use of intoxicating liquor, when ·
it becomes necessary, or is supposed to be so, by those
whose province it is to judge, in cases of sickness or
other emergency ; for the Bible not only authorizes wine,
and this alone to he used in the supper, but it directs us
to " give wine to him that is ofa heavy heart, and strong
drink to him that is ready to perish. "
Nor are such ultra views either necessary, or desir- •
able, for the promotion of the temperance cause. So
far from it, they present at this moment the greatest ob­
stacle to the universal adoption of the practice of " total
abstinence from all intoxicating drinks," among the
friends of that cause. The fact that they have been
promulgated, has in some measure identified the whole
temperance enterprise with their own character ; and
many good and wise men have withheld their influence
from total abstinence principles, from the fear of giving
countenance to what they can prove from the Bible to
be ultraism: At the same time such men are fully con­
vinced that the friends of temperance ought to maintain
both by precept and example the principle of " total ab­
atioence from e"ery j<Jrm o
falcoh.ol, as a beverage, and
are ready to unite with them on Bible grounds.
Our definition of ultraism, it will be obvious to the
1;J L T R A,. T E X P E R A 1'I C • · 133
reader, includes the idea that what is thu1 denomiaated,
is so called because it is untrue, as also is every other
doctrine which goes beyond the Bible. In this aspect
all neui light is/aha light, by whomsoever promulgated,
or by whatever good motives it may seem to be prompt·
ed ; nor is it called for to impeach the integrity of such,
since it only proves that " there is no light in them" on
that pat·ticular subject.
The principle of expediency is that on which alone
total abstinence can be successfully maintained, and thi9
is distinctly taught in the Bible by numero.us- precept.
and e_xamples. It was acted upon by our Lord and hill
apo11tles, and there are many cases in which ChristiaWI
are guided in the decision of the question of right or
wrong, by no other light. This, indeed, i1 invariably
the fact, in the great multitude of instances in which
1, there is no express statute in the whole legislation of tlie
! Bible, which applies to the circu01Btances. In such
cases, when any act or course of conduct is clearly ex..
pedient, it then becomes duty, only because it is expedi­
ent in view of all the. light we can obtain, but not be­
cause it would be morally wrong to do otherwise, inde­
pendent of circumstances, or in the sense of malum per
1e. It is by circumstances, and by these alone, that the
expediency of the act is ascertained ; and hence it be­
comes duty, even when no previous or abstract decision
could be made on the ground of moral obligation. A
· ' single example will as fully illustrate this truth, as though
we had ten thousand. Let us suppose that a fellow­
man is suddenly seized with alarming and dangeroua
symptoms, and no remedy of any kind is at hand, but
the contents ofa brandy-bottle, and no other vessel can
be proc•.ued. A�diciouamedical friend, who is pre.ent,
-

1 3-i U I. T :a A. • T E H P E R A. N C r; ,
under such circumstances pours into the mou th of the
sufferer a part, or the whole of the brandy, and though
the extemporaneous remedy restores the patient, yet it
afterwards developes intoxication. Shall such physician
be told that his course was morally wrong, and that he
has committed a sin against God ; for to use intoxicating
liquor in any quantity, or under any circumstances, ill
malum per 1e, and in proof, shall he be reminded that
God has said, in the Bible, " Wo to him that putteth the
bottle to hie neighbour's mouth, and maketh him drunk­
en 1 " Here it will be perceived, in this hypothecated
instance, there has been in the creed of ultraism a literal
violatioq of an express statute, and yet on the principle
of Christian expediency the circumstances render it no
violation at all. On the contrary, to have literally ful­
filled the statute, would have been a sin against God,
and the circumstances. would have made it such, on the
supposition that the physician exercised his best judge­
ment in the emergency. In this example, it is obvious
that Christian expediency indicated duty, nor could it
otherwise have been ascertained, and not at all on the
ground ofmoral obligation.
· In the illustration, just named, however, it is only in
the creed of ultraum, that any violation of the statute
would be admitted, for there would be, in fact, no·viola­
tion. The spirit and design of the denunciation of " wo
against him that putteth the bottle to his neighbour's
mouth," &e., in the case where it occurs, is perfectly
obvious, and it applies only to such an act, performed
with the intention of making our neighbour drunken, or
at least without any motive of benevolence towards him.
The attendant circumstances, therefore, are essential to
be known, before we can decide on the action, whether
1
U L T R A • T £ M P £ R A N O E . 135
it be right or wrong, and so in all 0th.er cases. But we
forbear to enlarge here, as we shall have occasion to
illustrate ,this point farther as we proceed.
The ultra1, then, .in the temperance ranks, who are
jUBtly thus denominated, are those who, for the sake of
promoting total abstinence from intoxicating drinks as
a beverage, adopt sentiments which go beyond the Bible,
and are therefore untrue. The examples of such, to
which we refer, are all those who oppose the use of
wine at the sacrament, on the , principle that it contains
alcohol, and all such as propagate the doctrine, that to
take one drop of alcohol, under any circumstances, is sin
against God. The latter theory is the source of the
former error, and both belong to the creed of ultraism.
, as we think has been proven by our inf
allible standard.
But this form of ultraism is still more to be depreca­
ted because ofthe erroneous and mischievous character
of the measures to which it has given origin among
aome of the ablest advocates of the temp1uance cause.
These mistaken men would never have been included
among the temperance ranks, had the friends of the
cause originally occupied this ultra ground. The refor­
�ation to which the American Temperance Society
gave the first impulse, by its wise and discreet measures,
and which has revolutionized the habits of millions in
two hemispheres, would have met the fate of other Uto­
pian experiments in morals, had its agents and friends,
at first, assumed the position occupied by the ultras.
It ' was the unity of design in making war upon " dis­
tilled liquors " alone, which then gave to the cause its
potency and its success. The evils of intemperance
bad become every where apparent, and the extensive
prevalence of the use of distilled liquors in all ranks of
118 U L T R. .A. • T S X P Z R. .ldl C & .
the community was 10 obvioualythe great cause of those
erils at that time, that other and minor causes of intem­
perance were overlooked, and to a great · e:s:tent uoaus­
pected. · While the proP,OSition of " total abstinence
from distilled liquors " as the only and aJl-sufficient
remedy, " commended itilelf to eyery man's heart ..-d
conscience in the sight of God," by the simplicity and
unity of the object to be effected. And still more, the
advocates of the cause urged the principles and prac­
tice they had espoused OD the Bible ground of upe­
diency, and hence their s,ignal and unparalleled success.
It is true, that the experience of a few years has de­
monstrated, that although the position they at first oc­
�upied, Wall that which under the circumstances of the
times, waa the only correct and tenable one ; yet, under
a change of circumstances, both expediency and neces­
lity have impelled them to take still higher ground, and
include the recommendation of total abstinence from all
intoxicatingliquors, iocludiog wine and fermented drinb.
To this course they have been impelled by glaring f
acta,
which their success in:the war against distilied liquors
had developed to public-view ; for, but for this succeu,
the extent of the mischief
s of intoxication from wine
aad f
ermented liquors, had not even now been disclosed.
These f
acts, under the influence of which tlie Ameri­
can Temperance Society have advanced in their efforts
to overthrow intemperance, by recommending total ab­
stinence from wine and fermented liquors, as well as
spiritous drin�s as a beverage, are before the world.
And as they can neither be perverted nor gainsayed,
they have been accumulating influence and power over
tlul public mind, until the great body of the friends of the
caue in Europe and America, are gradually apprecia·
- l
�
U L T R .l • T B M P .E iU. N C .E . 137
ting and adopting tbe01. Nor is it hazarding too much
to predict the ultimate triumph of the cause of total ab­
stinence, if it can l>e rescued from the devouring jaws
ofultraism, and urged upon the public only on the Bible
principle of expediency.
The practical error of the ultras, justly so called, is a
legitimate result of their creed. For maintaining, aa
they do, that " to use intoxicating drinks in any qoontity,
or under any circumstances, is an immorality," or in
other words malum per ae, a sin against God ; they en­
force the doctrine and practice of total abstinence on
the ground of moral obligation. Hence they disclaim
all fellowship with those who adhere to the Scriptural
doctrine of expediency even-although they practically
agree with them ; and they do more, they repudiate" and
even denounce the " old pledge," and refuse to recog­
nise as temperance men, all those who do not adopt
their standard. In truth, they aim to take the lead in ,
the temperance ranks, while they exclude from their fel­
lowship, all who originated and have perpetuated the
good work, unless they will consent to enrol their names
on the new pledge·; and they cease not to enforce a com­
pliance upon the theory they have espoused, and vainly
expect all not only to adopt their practice, but also to
subscribe to their system of ethics. Indeed many of
them go as far as to repudiate the very name of temper­
ance societies, and assume that of total abstinence ·so­
cieties, or as in England, they have self
-appropriated the
aeoseless cognomen of tee-totalism to their creed and
practice.
Meanwhile, multitudes of wise and . good men, have
been led from principle tQ advance· from the old pledge.
to the new one ; because they deem it expedient in vie1JC
12*
138 11 L T ll A • T II K P II R A l'( C s .
of the intemperance which is petennially detected from
wine and f
ermented drinks, and againat which they wish
• to array their enmple. While many more of such mea
have adopted the oew pledge with the view of reforming
their drunken neighbours, who have provea to !heir
own satisfaction and that of others, that they can never
be reclaimed, while they use any drink which is capable
of producing intoxication. But although such men re·
commend tot:al abstinence from all intoxicating drinks,
both by precept and example ; yet a very large majority
of them refuse to deaounce and anathematize the old
pl�e ; but on the contrary, regarding it as the traoei­
tion stage of the process by which they were themselves
brought to the " summit level of cold water," they con­
tinue to use and recommend " total abstinence from
diMUed liquor•," to all those who are unwilling to go
further ; and they rejoice, therefore, in every such acqui-.
sition to the friends of temperance, even upon the old
pledge. This they tio, not only on the quaint and fami·
liar maxim that " half a loaf is better than no bread,"
but because they believe it to be expedient, " when the1
cannot accomplillh all they uiovld, to do what they can."
And moreover they highly value the old pledge, because
of its intrinsic excellence, the good it has done and ill
still adapted to do, and for the additional reason, that
the transition ·from the old pledge to the new one, is but
a single step, while between the use of spiritous liquors,
and total abstinence from all intoxicating drinks, there
is a wide chasm, a " great gulf fixed," which fow cross
at a single stride, and for the passage of which the in- ·
termediate " half-way-house " is convenient,and in some
cues indispensable.
But unhappily, those who occupy the ultra ground we
r
U L T R A. • T E :M P J:. R A N C E . 139
are deprecating, by the prominence they have acquired
in t� control of a portion of .the temperance press, and
by the zeal and· liberality some of them have exhibited
io their cause, have multiplied the numbers, and streogth­
ened the hands of our enemies ; and what is still more ,
to be regretted, they have estranged very many of our
excellent friends. 'l'he suspiaion of similar ultraism,
has been attached to all the advocates and friends of
temperance ; and especially whenever they inculcate total
abstiuence, however kindly or rationally. l\iinisters and
cl
_
iurches once actively and zealously labouring to pro­
mote temperance, and total abstinence, on the Scriptu­
ral doctrine of expediency, have been conslrairied to
pause, and hesitate ; if they have not been driven from
the work, by the fierceness and extravagance of these
ultras. And those who regarding wine to be a scriptu­
'1llly allowed drink in certain cases, have perceived the
tendency of ultraism in this department to invade the
ordinances of the sanctuary, have become disgusted ltith
such leaders, and with such a press ; and hence they
have withdrawn from all active participation with the
cause, until they can unite· with us·without seeming to
be identified with.the creed of ultraism, or the denuncia·
tory practice to which it impels its votaries.
To disabuse the public mind of the prevalent mistake
that the American Temperance Society, or its true
friends; are responsible for the ultraism and f
anaticism
so often alleged, this exposition of its principles, and
criticism on some of its misguided, though honest and
zealous supporters, has been attempted. And if, as we
humbly hope, the truth and nothing but the truth is here
presented both in our criticism and exposition, we think
the judicious and discerning, will perceive that what we
140 U L T R A • T E JI P E R .l N C E .
have denominated ultra-temperance, dese"es to be class­
ed among the reigning humbugs of the day. It is ju1tly
denominated ultra,not only because it is inexpedient, but
because it goes beyond the Bible, and is therefore untrue.
And surely no benevolence of motive can justify the
advocacy even of a good cause by false philosophy, or
false logic. And we apply the homely epithet humbug,
with the same justice and propriety as in other cases,
because like the others it is an imposture.
In sheer justice, however, to the great and good tem­
perance cause it is due still further to add, that all who
would include any other articles of food, drink, or luxu­
ry in addition to intoxicating drinks, into the pledge ;
or who allege other forms of intemperance, however
great and . flagrant, as identical with that produced by
alcohol, are justly to be classed among the ultras. Other
forms of intemperance there aret in eating, sleeping, in
dress, in labour, in exposure, in the indulgence of de�
praved and morbid appetites, and in excesses of every
kind. But the superior excellence and potency of the
temperance reformation consists in its simplicity · and
unity of design. This enterprise, though employing the
genoral term " temperance" as its distinctive title, is aim­
ed at overthrowing that singleform ofintemperance which
results from " the use ofintoxicating drinks as a bever­
age ;" and it is ultrailf1I, therefore, to pervert temperance
societies from their singleness of design, by including
any other topic whatever. They, therefore, who· insist
that tobacco is a cause of intemperance, however justly,
must be regarded as enemies io Temperance Societies,
when they lltlempt to unite it to intoxicating drinks in
the . pl.dge of total abstinence, since there can be no
analogy in the case ; the roischiefs to the public morals
U L T a A • T E .M P .B R A N C E , l·U
being in no sense identical in the the two cases; And
besides; to divide our energies in contending agaiast the
vice of intempenmte drinking, is to weaken them, and
retard, if not prevent our success. Let such form anti­
tobacco societies, if they think the evil calls for so for·
mal an assault, and no one will justly accuse them of
ultraism.
'
The same may be said of the ultraism of those who
would include tea and coff
ee, animal f
ood, and wrious
other articles of nutriment and luxury, among the causee
of intemperance. Indeed some of these pseudo-reform·
ers, have laboured to humbug the public into the belief
that the regimen of invalids and valetudinarians, and
dyspeptics, who, by a physical necessity9 are doomed to
" short allowance," should be adopted by men in health.
And some of these " starvation lecturers " have gulled
many of their hearers into the habitual rejection of all
the bounties and blessings of providence, as articles of
diet, except a daily morsel of .. bran bread, and cold
water ;" and this humbug bas been propagated under
the plea of being included in the objects of Temperance
Societies. Hence by this form of ultraism, many have
been deterred from uniting with these societies, lest the
" total abstinence from intoxicating drinks," at first urged
upon them, be only the entering" wedge to a system of
universal proscription of every luxury and comfort,
however lawful and innocent. Indeed the perpetual
eff
orts made by every fanatic in this department, to
marshal successive humbugs under the banner of Tem­
perance Societies, bas been one of the most successful
devices of our enemies.
The author of a late tlagitious publication, entitled
" Protestant Jesuitism," bas availed himself of these
142 U L T B A • T IUI P E B A K C S .
uamplea of uUraiam, to gull the public into a belief in
the justice of his crusade against the doctrines of the
Temperance Society, and prepare them to receive with
favour his apology and defence of rum-selling and rum­
drinking. The firm aod consistent adhesion of the
friends of temperance, however, to their first principles,
by making war upon alcohol, and this alone, leaving all
other forms of intemperance to other reformers, and dis­
claiming all union or co-operation with those who would
divide the unity of their design, has long since written
the epitaph, both of the author and his book.

need to be reminded, that the abolitionism of Tbomu
Jeff
erson, Benjamin Franklin, Dr. Rush, John Jay,
and other illustrious worthies, is not thus denominated,
although all these regarded slavery to be an evil, and
emancipation a good, and they never ceased to seek the
gradual and entire abolition of slavt>ry, and to labour to
promote it. But none of these were justly called ultra
in their creed or practice, and hence the application of
the term humbug to their doctrines, or the insinuation
of imposture against their efforts would be little l'hort of
sacrilege. Indeed, their testimony against ultra-aboli­
tionism is among the evidences of its folly.
Having premised thus much, we now direct the at­
tention of the reader to another class of ultras, who are
called Anti-Slavery Societies,but whom we have denomi­
nated ultra-abolitionists. By these, we mean to desig­
nate all who maintain the doctrine, that the act of slave.
holding or having " property in man," is malum per ae ;
or in other words, is a " ain againat God, indepeadellt
of all circumstancea." This doctrine we affirm to be
ultraiBftt, because it goes beyond the Bible, and is there­
fore untrue.
That we do not include those abolitionists.who view
slavery as an evil, and benevolently desire its abolition,
and pray for the emancipation of all who.are in bonds,
and contribute ll,.S much as- in them lies to prepare the
way for its ultimate annihilation, is because such do
not go beyond the Bible £:ither in their creed or practice.
They believe that there may be circumstances in which
the act of holding slaves is nut a sin against God ; and
that " property in man," under '1ertain circumstances,
-has been recognised by the Divine law, and is siill 80
U L 'l' R A. .. A. 8 0 t l' t I 0 N 1 8 111 . 145
'recognisPd. Nay more, they believe that there may be
tircumslances in which it is the duty of those who hold
slaves lo continue to hold them ; and when, without a
change ofcircumstances, the act ofliberation .would be a
sin against God, and one of a most cruel and inhuman
character. Of course, such abolitionists do not presume
to insist on immediate abolition as a duty in all cases, nor
do they found their arguments in f
avour of emancipation
on the basis that the act of sla'r'eholding is malum per
se. They are in favour of emancipation wherever and
whenever it is safe and practicable.
The views they learn from the Bible are these, viz.· :
that n o action can be justly decided to be either malum,
or bonum PER SE. The question of right and wrong, in
any given case, is adjudicated by the Divine law, uni·
versally in connexion with its circumstances, and not
abstractly. For examplP, the commandment, " Thou
shalt not kill," is imperative and unqualified, and yet it
was never designed to prohibit killing, independent of
circumstances. So far from this being the fact, the Jew­
ish lawgiver, by Divine authority, established a system
of sacrifices which wholly consisted in a repetition of
the act of killing, and the blood of the animals slain for
these purposes, for centuries smoked upon .God's own
altars. Nor did the command prohibit killing men, 100-
mm, and children, independent of circumstances, as
may be seen in Abraham's virtual sacrifice of Isaac,
and in the multiplied examples in which God com­
manded great multitudes to be killed, as recorded in the
sacred volume, and also in the memorable " cities of
refuge," provided by divine appointment for the man­
slayer, who had kilkd a man unaware1. These were
all killing, and according to the creed of ultraism, fla-
1 3
146 U L T R A • A B O L I T I O J U B JI .
grant violations ofthe commandment, but in truth thrire
is no violation in any of the cases, because of the cir­
cumstances which are essential to decide the moral
quality ofthe act.
Let us illustrate our position by a case of frequent oc­
currence in common life. A man is killed in the street,
a,nd an ultra hearing .of it, affirms forthwith, that the
man who did the deed is guilty of murder, for killing is
tnalumper ae. Such decision may be utterly erroneous,
nor can we at all estimate the moral qualily of the act .
ofkilling until all the circumatancea arc kno" n. For the
author ofthe deed may have committed it with malice
prepense, and in that case is n mu,.dtrer ; or he may
have done so in a moment of passion, and is then guilty
of inanalaughter ; or it may have been the only resort
for the preservation of his own life from a ruffian as­
aault, and would be justifiable homicide; or he may have
been the innocent instrument of the death of his fellow
man by an unavoidable casualty, which no caution or
foresight could prevent, and in this last case would n.ot
be guilty of any crime ; or still farther, be may have
purposely shot the man to the heart, as the only means
to prevent him from setting fire to a magazine of gun­
powder, which would have destroyed hundreds of hu­
man lives, and in such case he would have been guilty
ifhe had not committed the act, in the eye ofevery law
whether human or divine.
Such are only a few of the circumstances which es­
sentially modif
y and even change the moral quality of
the act ofkilling, and the same may said of slave-hold­
ing, and any other action upon which ultraism hazards
its blind and indiscriminate anathemas. All who study
moral science in the Bible, will perceive that every sin,
V L 't 8 A • A B O L I T I O N I S M. 147
which by express statute is pronounced t� be such, is
one for the commission of which, a number ofuaenlilll
eircu11&1tancu must be present. With these, no addi­
tional circumstanc_es can change its sinful character ; but
without these, tltis sin cannot be predicated ofany given
case. Hence we argue from the Bible, that though_
there be a violation ef the letter of the commandment,
even when there i.s an expre11s statute, if there be no
violation of its spirit, the commandment is not broken.
Oil the contrary, the transgression of the apirit of the
commandment, includes all the essential circumstance•
which characterize the act ofits violation, and nece$1&­
rily includes -also the letter of the commandment, even
when the act is not consummated. Hence, says our
standard, " He that looketh upon a w�man to lust after
her, hath committed adultery already with her in his
heart," and again " He that is angry with his brother,
without a cause, is a murderer.'' In these and the
like eases, the spirit ofthe commandment is broken, and
the sin is committe� though the letter of the law re.
mains UBviolated.
With these preliminary views� we now return to
ultra-abolitionism, as already define� and to prove that
the Bible does recognise property in man under ce�tain
cireumatancea, we refer to the Old and New Testamentl
tbrougltout, in which we shall find the following unde.
niable facts, abundantly sustained.
lat. That slavery i.n some form; 'wbich recogniaed
" property in man " has always existed sioee the days
of the patriarchs. _
2nd. That God bu not only permitted its e:zistence,
but legislated for ita abolition in some r.aaes, and f
or its
perpetuity in others.
148 U L T B A • A JI O J. l T J O ft l l X .
3rd. That the precepts ofthe Old and New Testa•
ments, are addreued to both masters and 1lavea, aod
this relation 10 far from being di1turbed, was fully re·
cogni1ed.
4th. That the rights of the muter or owner of slave
property, are acknowledged and protected by the Divine
le.w.
Nor indeed do we need anyother proofthan the tenth
com'!landment of the decalogue, which is of universal
aod perpetual obligation, - for we there read, " Thou
shalt not covet thy neighbour's ma7'*servant, nor thy
neighbour's maid-servant, nor any thing that is hi1."
And surely no oue need to be informed that the word
his, when the ellipsis is filled up, means " his property ;"
for it cannot possibly mean any thing else. _
But let no ultra now accuse us of " quoting Scripture
to justify .llmerican slavery," which such regard little
short of high treason, for these references �o the. Bible
are made solely for the purpose of showing the ultraism
of the doctrine, that the act of holding a slave under any
circumstances is sin against God ; since there are cir- .
cumstances in whieh God himselfhas recognised u' pro­
perty in man," and cateria paribua .he does so now.
Whether any individual slaveholder be a sinner or not,
in America or elsewhere, can only be adjudicated at\er
a knowledge of the circumatances ; for upon these, the
morality of the act will depend.
To enable the reader to estimate the c:orrectness of
these principles, we will suppose a case ; and let it be
remembered, that a single example will as etfoctually
overthrow the ultraismupon which we are animadverting,
as though we were to enumerate a million of them. The
foundation of the system is, that the act of " holding
U L T JU. • .A. B0 L 1 T I 0 N 11!1 M , 149
property in man" is .malum per ae,· a ain against God,
independent of all circumstance&. Now if we can sho"!
a single in.stance in which this is not true, out of a
multitude which might be named, the. whole theory an4
practice of ultraism will be proven to be beyornl the
Bible, and therefore untrue.
Suppose, then, that a gentleman in the South, has a
plantation with a number of slaves as his paternal in­
heritance, and among these slaves a number of them are
idiots, and have always been Wlllble either to heaefit
him, or to take care of themselves. They are altogether
helplesa as inf
ants, and did be not continue to f
eed and
clothe t�em, and provide for their wants, they must llOOll
perish. We inquire, do not these " circumstances"
annihilate the sin of slaveholding, so f
ar as these helpleH
peraona are concerned, and would be not sin against
God, should he liberate them and suff
er them to 1ta"e 'I
But this, it will be siid, is a strong case, and though
not less appropriate, yet we take
,
another. Suppose he
have a number of able·bodied. slaves, who are valuablo
and productive. They and their ancestors, for several
geurations, have belonged to the plantation, and been
owned by the family. They are ignorant of letters, ud
the laws of the state forbid their instruction under -into!,.
erable penalties. The laws against emancipation, amount
to a prohibition unless they are removed from the state,
and they refuse to be sent to Liberia. Ia such ease, if
the benevolence ofthe master prompt him to emancipate
them, there are insuperable difficµlties in the way. They
are not prepared for f
reedom by education, nor is he al­
lowed to prepare them. They have Dever· provided f
or
thematilves, nor could they do so if tbey were free. If
he liberate them, and· turn them oft' his plantation, they
13""
150 U L T R A • A B O L I T I O l!l' J B M.
would be arrested and sold into elavery, perhaps under
greater atBiction than they endure. And should he ex­
pend all he has in transporting them into thi; free states,
he conscientiously believes they would famish or freeze,
and he is constrained religiously to f
eel, that hi11 sacred
duty to these slaves, is to keep them in bondage for their
own sakes. Possibly he finds them a burden to him,
from which he would be gladly relieved, but his con­
science will not allow him to sell them, and he cannot
emancipate them under any circumstancell which he
does not verily believe would prove their ruin.
·
Perhaps
he hopes and ardently desires that the laws of the state
in which he lives may be modified and improved, so a11
to render abolition safe and practicable, aud he retains
his slaves, as a duty and as a burden. Now all these
" circumstances " exist in numerous cases in the south­
ern states ; and yet if thtlre were but One such, it would
prove that the act of slaveholding is not a sin under
all circumstances, arid that immediate, instant abolition
would neither be lawful nor expedient in a
ny such
ex.ample.
·
. That there are petty tyrants and despots in America,
and elsewhere, who bold their fellow-men in bondage,
because they love slavery and its wages, and who would
fain perpetuate it lo the latest generation, is not denied .
These would not liberate their slaves, if every door was
open for them to do so ; and there are those among
them who would withhold educat�on and thegospel from
the hapless victims of their tyranny, even if there were
no restraints imposed either by law or necessity. Such
masters furnish examples in which the act of slavehold­
ing, is accompanied by essential circumstances, which
constitute that act malmn per se, a sin against God and

11ature ; and such examples have driven many into the
ranks. of ultraism, because of these being falselyrepre­
sented as specimens of the general nnd universal char·
acter of slaveholders. 'Ve affirm that they are very
rlU'ely found, and nre exceptions to the general rule ; but
be they few or many, we utterly disclaim all sympathy
or fellowship with their principles, because like those of
the opposite extreme, they go beyond the Bible, and are
therefore ultras, though antipodal to the former.
On the other hand, there are Christian masters who
own slaves, and yet, the act of slaveholding is on their
part accompanied by circumstances which fully justif
y
tlie act for the present, and until there shall be a change
ofthose circumstances. This they ardently desire and pray
for, and they abhor the restnrints which their legislators
have thrown upon the education and religious instruction
oftheir slaves, and are utterly hostile to those laws under
which they live. which prohibit emancipation, and even
the preparation fot freedom which their benevolence
would otherwise prompt. But still they have slaves,
whom they cannot get rid of by any process which wtll
not . be mischievous if not ruinous to them ; and such,
though actual slaveholders, are so under circumstances,
which instead of being sinful, would render immediate
abolition both sin and cruelty.
The whole sect of ultras on the abolition question,
build all their arguments on this position, " the act of
l1olding a alatJe is sin," or as they often express it, " to
claim •property in man,'underany circumatancea, ia sin."
We maintain that this position is ultra, or that it goes
beyond the Bible, and as all the philosophy, logic, reli­
gion, and practice, of modern abolitionism is founded
'
162 U L T R. A • A B 0 L I T I 0 N 1 8 Ill ,
upon this fallacy, we reject their principles and meaa­
u�s as ultraiam, and eminently 6Dtitled to this appella­
tion. Indeed if their position of the abstract sinfuloeu
ofslavery is admitted into the creed, it must be obvioWI,
that the duty ofimfmdiate abolition becomes binding on
all men, for all should " ceaae ainningimmediately t11ithoul
regard to circumatancea and COflaequencea." And hence
when men adopt such views, if they love the souls of
slaveholders, they are impelled to insist oo their instaRtly
emancipating their slaves, on p'liD of eternal damnation.
\Vith the Bible in their hands, they feel authorized to
denounce " slaveholders " as " robbers, pirates, man-
1t.ealers," for these criminals are only ainnera, and the
act of slaveholdiog is sin, independent of all circum-
1tances. Hence, when they become zealous in the
f
aith, they " verily tftiok they do God service," by indis­
criminate anathemas and censoriousoeSB, not only upoa
1laveholders en maaae, but especially upon Christiau,
who are guilty of this sin ; and they even denominate
the religion they profess, a " whip-plaiting, chain-forging,
man-stealing Christianity." Indeed such epithets belong
to the v�abulary of ultraiam, and are hurled equally at
thoae, who dare to doubt, or even hesitate, whether there
may not be circumstances io which ·slaveboldiog may
not be this " heinous sin against God."
We are not among those who have marvelled at the
extravagances into which this creed bas impelled meo,
who, on other topics, are somewhat dispassionate ; for
thia is the legitimate fruit of radical error, when it lies
atthe foundation ofreligious creed, and that this is such
an error may be apparent, when we remember that it
does not even profess to be built upon the Bible. Tbe
U L T R. .l • .l B 0 L J T J 0 N 1 8 Jll , 153
doctrine, that " slavery is a sin, independent ofall tir- _
c11m1tancu," and that " immediate abolition is duty,
irrespective of all consequence," is not found, even by
implication, in the Bible. · Indeed this doctrine is avow­
edly derived from the TEXT " all men are born f
ree and
equal," which is not only, not in the Bible, but, in the
sense in which these ultras abuse and pervert it, is ex-
. pressly contrary to its teachings. It is the creed of
infidels universally, who reject the Bible ; and it has led
not only to _this form of ultraism, but to every species of
anarchy, ultra-democracy, and agrarianism. And yet
it is the chosen motto of ultra-abolitiouists, who would
thus rally the patriotism of the nation, by this ad captan­
dt1m flourish.
If the leaders of the ultra-abolition movements of the
day had not found the Bible against them, they would
have looked elsewhere than in the Declaration of Inde­
pendence, for the foundation-stone of their system. For,
highly as Americans value that venerable document, and
honour the names and principles of their fathers who
issued it, they can never be persuaded nor deluded into
so flagrant an error by any perversion of the language of
that instrument. Were not the signers of that " Bill.of
Rights," either slaveholders, or citizens of a slaveholdiog
country, representatives of those who held slaves ; and
was it not alleged among the grievances complained
of in that declaration itself, that the mother country, a
slaveholding nation, had taken away slave property from
our citizens 1 And yet are we to be told that when they
declared the " inalienable rights of man, to be life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness," that they either taught or
implied a denial of the " right of property in man 1"
Much less does this perver11ion of their sentiments find
164 T L T R A. • A B O L J T I O M J I Jll ,
. any countenance, when it is recollected, that after the
succ-ess of the revolution they then commenced, the
conatitution of the United States was framed with an
express recognition of slaveholding among the rese"ed
rights of the several states, with which the general gov­
ernment should never interfere.
Whatever else then our fathers meant by the senti­
ment so often repeated, that " all men are born free and
equal," they never meant to annihilate the distinction in
which Paul gloried, that be was FREE·BORM. Thia and
the various distinctions among out race, which are the
result of the allotments of Divine Providence, are fre­
quently recognised in the Bible, but no where is it there
insinuated that " all men are born free and equal," ac­
cording to the misapplication of this maxim by these
ultru, since the history of the world would have been a
practical refutation of such a sentiment. We learn
indeed that " God is no respecter of persons," and that
" God made of-one blood all the nations of the earth,"
but these and the like testimonies of the Bible afford no
support to the ultraism we are considering.
But let us inq�ire why ultra-abolitionists have chosen
thls human maxim as their potent motto, instead of the
golden rule of our blessed Lord, " As ye would that
others should do unto you, do ye even so unto them."
After what we have said, the reason must be very ob·
vious. This golden rule, as d�s all other Divine legis­
lation, regards cicrumatances and comeqt1ence1, and
hence would not suit the purposes of 1,_1ltralsm, and this
will evidently appear if we apply it to the case of an in­
dividual slaveholder. Ifsuch an one, who is a Christian
man, be-approached with this.rule and immediate aboli­
tion be urged. upon him, he might reply by acknowledg-
•
U L T a A • A B 0 L I T I 0 :N I S M , 155
iog its paramount au(hority, and declaring his readiness ·
to acquiesce in obegience to its requirements, and at the
same time, take the following position. " If I and my
familywere slaves, and one ofmy present slaves occupied
my relation as master, if our mutual circumstances were
the same as at present, I can say in my conscience
before my l\'Iaker, and iµ view of lhe judgement to
which I am hastening, Iwouldthat he should retain me
. and my wife and children in bondage, rather than eman- .
cipate us irrespective ofconsequences. In retaining my
slave property, therefore, under present circumstance•,
I am literally acting upon the golden rule, and • doing to
them as I would be done by ' under similar circum­
stances." Now if this Christian master was a man of
unimpeachable integrity and veracity, and there are
many such who occupy this precise ground, it will be
ob.-ious, that the argument and logic of the abolitionist
would be at an end, nor would his " golden rule either
prompt to denunciation, or allow of evasion. The same
difficulty would lie with any other Bi,ble maxim, for the
law of God invariably regards both " circumstances and
consequences," while ultraism disclaims these as be­
longing to the rejected " doctrine of expediency,"
But we pursue this thought in a different aspect, and
inquire whether the doctrine that " slaveholding is sin,
independent of all circumstances," finds any semblance
ofauthority in the Bible definitions of ain. What is sin
according to our standard 1 We select a few of the more
prominent definitions, viz. " Sin is the transgression of
the law.". We suppose the law of Qod, is that here
1poken of, and that the Jaw must be bow1i, and its trana­
gression be "olu.tary, in order to be fin. To convict o( ·

1 56 U L T R .l • .l B O L I T I O N I B M ·
cu must he regarded. Does he know the law of God
he is violating1 Is his transgression voluntary 1 In
many cases these questions must be answered in the
negative, while
.
in others, the continuance for a longer or
shorter time ofthe act of slaveholding, because of " cir·
cumstances," may be
·
a duty. This is the case with un·
protected children ; infirm, aged, and aftlicted sl11ves ;
and especially such as deprecate emancipation, and pro­
test against being liberated from an intelligent view of
evil consequences. Though we might supp'>se a great
variety of cases In which " immediate abol,ition without
regard to consequences" would be sin according to this
definition ; a " transgression of the law," both human
and Divine.
Again " all unrighteousness is sin." And is the act
of slaveholding intmriably an act of unrighteousness 1
This depends upon " circumstances," and such wiH
often prove the negative of this question, for there have
been cases in which property in man has been acquired
and retained for a long time from a righteous motive,
and the slave has been thus protected from unrighteous­
ness, and surely in such cases there was no unrighteous­
ness in the act. The same may be said in relation to
that comprehensive definition, " He that knoweth to do
good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin." In order to
criminate the act of slaveholding by this criterion, the
" circumstances " are all-i�portant, for the slaveholder
must know that by " immediate abolition " he would do
good, and it is only for want of this knowledge, or be­
cause of a contran
J knowledge, that many Christian
masters do not liberate their slaves. But we forbear to
enlarge, and now brieflyproceed to another aspect of this
same form of ultraism.
•

These ultra-abolitionistshave auother mode ofarguing
their position, and it is this : " Slavery is an evil, and
ifso, it is a morAl evil, for whatever is torong is moraUy
wrong. There can be no neutrality in morals." These
and the like positions are constantly repeated by ultras
not only of this class, but every other. Let us look ill
this doctrine for a moment, in the light of our standard,
for we allege it to be ultraism, only because it goes be­
yontl the Bible. The sentiment is, that there is no
diff
erence between an action being wrong and morally
wrong ; or in other words, whatever is wrong, is sin
against God. Need we detain the reader by any argu­
ment, or evidence, that this position is both false and
absurd1 Is there no such thing as error in judgement,
mistake, and unavoidable infirmity 1 and are these all
morally wrong 1 Are not many things done involuntarily,
which are wrong in them.selves, and yet not morally
wrong ? Or are all the errors in judgement to which
the holiest men · are liable, so many sins against God.
Then indeed would. the Jaw of God be absolutely im­
practicable, and man must be an omniscient and infallible
being, before such a law could be adapted fo his nature.
But does not the Bible utterly annihilate this limb o(
•ltraism 1 Paul distinctly affirms, that though " all
things were latoful, yet all things were not expedient ;"
and however this plain sentiment may be interpreted, if
it means any thing, it must mean that some things would
to him be morally right, and yet by reason of Circum­
stances they would be inexpedient. And this is essen­
tially to declare that though they would be torong, yet
not 1norally wrong, and accordingly in numerous instan­
ces he asserts his moral rights, while be relinquishea
them wholly on the ground of expediency, which be as-
14
168 U L T & A • A B O L I T I O Jl l S • •
_eertaina by the "circumstances and · couequeoces.''
and these are uniformly regarded, as we have seen, hy
"1 the inspired writers. Nor C!ln we find. througaollt
tbe entire Bible, a single example in which sin is defined
" independent ofcircumstances," or duty enjowed " wif!a..
out regard to consequences."
Nor are we at liberty to withhold our reprobation frOlll
the ultr111 of the times, who have allowed themselves.to
lfeny that slavery is an ,evil. Still more flagr&Dt is the
ultraism of those politiciane and atatesmen who have
been provoked into the declaration that they rep.rd
1lavery as the " basis of our free institutions." Indeed
some mistaken religionists at the l!outh, have st,rangely
and incoherently resolved in their ecclesiastical capacity,
that " slavery, aa it exists among them, is not a moral
eYil ! " To publish such a sentiment, as emanating
from a body of Christian ministers, has astounded the
moral seu.se of this nation, because of the obvious uJ.
trai,sn it exhibits. It is no justification 'to allege, that
the ultraism of the abolitionists ofthe north, bu impelhtd
them to the opposite error. The only palliation which
is. concievable, is found in the construction of their lan­
guage which charity suggests, that they only meant to
� their belief that the act of alaveholding is nQt
i" "1l c111ea morally wrong. This opinion, thus axpreae­
ed. would have met a response from all but ahltllow
thinkers, whether in the north or south. But. that the
ayatem of " slavery as it exists in the i;outh is not a
moral evil," is too flagrant a humbug to be palmed upon
men ofreason and religion any where. While husbands
�d wives, parents and children, may bef

other feature obnoxious- ·to the cllarge, each a syetcnn
and such laws are morally torong; nor can any·" rel!O.
lution " passed by any human authority, change their
character. Thia fellture of slavery may be kgallyrigbt,
and the bad Jaws which make it 110 are to be endured, '
until thtiy can be constitutionally altered ; but because it
can never be " morally right," Christians are bouod ft>
labour for the repeal of such laws, nor can they contia•
tently cease to testify against the system whieh aandiona
such cruelty lllld inhumanity as " a rnoral evil," without
degenerating into . ultraism, as criminal as that which
belongs to the creed of ultra-ahootionism.
That " slavery ia an evil," however, can be proved
&om the Bible. since it is every where treated as such,
and this without appealing to " the Declaration ofInde­
pendence," or any human " bill ofrights." Multitudel
ofthe slaveholders themselves, feel and deplore this e-.il,
and would fain be delivered from i1 if they could, with­
out incurring themselves and involving others ia a woree
evil. Such may and po8$ibly do err in judgemellt, in
relation to the difficulties in their way, and in this they
are wrong, but · whether they are mot'ally urong in re­
taining their slaves, until they can see how they caa
safely emancipate them. can only be solved by a know­
ledge ofall the " circumstances." These are known to
the " Searcher of Hearts," and so far as any of thele
Christian masters violate the " law of lov�," they will
reeeive their reward.
But while we thus believe and llope, yet we are eon­
•trained to admit, that there are still greater multitudea
of slaveholders who ue such from choice ; they " love
the wage• of unrighteousness," and would filin perpetu­
ate alanry to the latest·generation. These are the op-

pre91cn whom Goel will judge, and who hue cause to

Bible, records their hiltory, condemns their crimes, and
Qlacrihea their doom. Nor ie there any danger of
.. going beyond the Bible, and degenerating into ultraiam,
in denouncing against such, all the curses which are
written in God's book, for their " damnatioa slumbereth
not."
But the " spirit of meekness " in which we are to
" declare the wholeceuneel of God," even againat these,
i1 essentially diff
erent from that which okra-abolitionism
inspires and every where exhibits. And the importance
of this absorbing topic, and the nriety of means ·em­
ployed by the party, in propagating their stupendous
humbug, must be our apology, for dwelling upon its nu­
merous aspects more at length, and criticising their
dogmas in detail.
Not to " discern the·signs ofthe times," in the esti­
mation of the Divine Redeemer of men, betrays a.vol­
untary ignorance so criminal, as to call forth from His
lips a most pointed rebuke and admonition. The like
criminal indifference can alone account for the apathy
of those patriots, or Cbrietians, who do not deplore the
controversy now raging witk so much vehemence, in so
large a portion of our common country, on the subject
of dcnnntic alawery. That this confli.ctportends nought
but evil, to the civil as well as religious relidions of this
great nation, DO one can doubt, who is not ignorant alike
ofthe history of the past, and of the exciting nature of
the subject in dispute. And iftbe existence of this con­
troversy on the part of individuals, chiefty resident in
the non�slaveholding sections ofthe country, be depre-.
cated by the wise and good, as not only neccuan,,

f
nt.itlua, but essentially mischievous ; how much more
ie this subject worthy of our attention, in view of the
. �rit in which it is conducted, and the extent ofthe in­
etrumentalities it is employing in the work ofagitation.
Nor can it be overlooked, that the controversy is almoet
wholly on one aide, since the clamor, the agencies, the
harangues, the societies, the threatening, the censorioue­
ness, and the publications which are teeming from the
press, in every variety of form, are nearly all enlisted
by the party devoted to tdtra-aboliticmism. And what
is still more to be lamented, the vut sums of money,
which have been so prodigiously lavished by the leaden
ofthis party, in their unprofitable and visionary crueade,
might have conferred inestimable benefits upon our race,
and even upon the alleged objects of their sympathy,
bad they not been diverted from the legitimate cha.
nels of Christian benevolence.
That a crisis has arrived which calls f
or the calm de.
liberation of every citizen ofthis republic on this great
question. will be conceded by al1 who venerate the
name ofpatriotism, or acknowledge the claims ofChriati..
anity. Already, has this " ultra-abolitionism" enlistedthe
·pulpits, and the churches ofthe North and East, to an
extent which threatens the annihilation ofthe ties whick
unite the ministry and membership of those denomina­
tions, whose ecclesiastical unity in the North and the
South, has until recently been preserved inviolate aJMl

forth like water ; and; by this potentengine, domestic and
foreign eloquence bu been engaged ; the powerful Rid
of the muses has been invoked ; and thus; the spell of
oratory and song bas been thrown around the sophisms- •
of this exciting .topic. Scores of popular declaimers
have been sent from the pulpit, ·and the bar, on agen-
cies of ultra-abolitionism, many of whom have thus bet-
tered their circumstances, in this work ofagitation, not
only in a pecuniary point of view, but they have ac­
quired an importance and a notpriety, which however
unenviable, they had long sought, and greatly prefer to
their former obscurity. Very many such who found the
avenues to competence only open to patient industry in
their appropriate vocations, and being averse to labour,
have been elevated from absolute pauperism, by agen- ·
cies, editorial or declamatory to which they have been
promoted. Thus have a great multitude of men, and
10omm too, been gathered into the ranks of public agita-
tors, and most inappropriately elevated into the charac-
ter of public reformers. With ·sucn an amount of means
as misguided benevolence bas furnished, and with such
men and materials for exciting popular feeJing, on this
most inflammable subjeet, it is no marvel thllt more ·
noise has been made in the world by this controversy'
·than by aoy other event since the discovery t f gun­
powder. It is lamentable to add, that the analogy is
perfect in relation to the explosions of both these " great
moral engines," since both gunpowder and " ultra·
· abolitionism " effect mischief by those airy concussions
denominated wind, and seldom yield any other product
upon analysis, though both contain-so large a proportion
offire and brimstoneI
But all this money, and all these instrumentalitie1, ·

might expend their force without mischief, if they were
merely employed in diacuaaing the subject of slavery,
and in promoting emancipatioD. If they confined them­
se�ves to the facts and arguments whichprove slavery to
be an evil, and emancipation a good ; - the " free dis­
cussion " in the pulpit, upon the forum, or through the
press, of these important subjects, especially in the non­
slaveholding states, would occasion no civil discord,
create no political strife, nor would it alienate friends
and brethren from each other ; much less produce the
geographical divisions between the North and the South,
.which now threaten the peace of the nation. No one
would oppose such " liberty ofspeech and ofthe press,"
or complain of the use of undoubted and inalienable
rights.
Let it be understood, however, that it is not the. " facts
_and arguments " employed by the agents of ultra-ab­
olitionism, which have agitated the community, and dis­
turbed the quiet of the nation. So far as the professed
design ofthe American Anti-Slavery Society, to employ
only moral suasion in their cause, has been adhered to, ·
instead ofproducing excitement, it has scarcely resulted
in . any perceptii>le senllltion upon the public mind.
Calm .and dispassionate reasoning, " addressed to the
understandings and consciences " of ou� fellow-citizens,
whether in the North or .the South, never did and never
can disturb thG public tranquillity, nor endanger the pub­
lic peace. The abolitionists · ofthe old school, such as
Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, Benjllmin Rush, and
others of. illustriou� aod sacred memory, coridemoed
slavery � and toiled for the gradual emancipation ofthe
coloured race, with the zeal and perseverance inspired
16( U L T R .l • A. B O L I T J 0 Jf 1 8 tl .
· by Christian philanthropy, and they oeYer had cane le
complain of the abridgment of their liberty or rights.
It is not now, nor was it ever true, in the biistory of
this country, however often it may have been alleged,
that "free discussion" on any subject bas been prohibi­
ted, or even restricted. Nor is there any disposition in
the people of this nation, even in the South, to prohibit
the free disc'..lssion of the " delicate subject " of slavery,
provided s'aid discussion be conducted in accordance.
with the constitution and laws of the lane!, and without
trespassing upon civil rights. The objections have been
made, not against the contr°"�r'!I in which modern abo­
litionists are engaged, but to the spirit in which it baa
been and still is conducted, and to the tendency of the
measures adopted by the party. Legal and illegal
means have been resorted to, not to control the liberty
efthe press, but to correct the licentiouanua ofthe pre.u ;
oot against the frml<Jm of discussion, but against thfi
lltttemua, tcrath, ce11Bo1-ioumea1, and calumny to which
the zealots of modem abolitio&ism have been impelled,
by their false philanthropy and misguided benevolence.
Such are the facts of the case, and it is due to truth and
candour that they should be repeated until the public
mind is disabused from
·
the stupendous sophisms by
which they have been concealed.
While then we unite in reprobatingall lawlessviolence,
hy whomsoever employed, and under what specious pre­
tences soever it may be vindicated, Jet the facts of the
mse be fairly stated. And ihhis be done, it wtll appear
� mobs and riots hav-e been, and are opposed with
greater unanimity, among the enemies of ultra-abo­
Jitionism, than by the party who have directly sutferecl
from their vengeance ; since these apparently inYite
U L T Jl .l • .l B O L l T I O l U UI . 165
them, and certainly rejoice over them, as furnishing new
recruits to strengthen their ranks. This result how­
ever, if it be true as alleged, would never be realized if
the facts were known, for the great mass of the people
in this nation although strenuously opposed to abolition­
ism, are still more hostile to mobbing and rioting, and
hence such illegal violence bas never yet been sup­
pressed by the abolitionists, although they were its vic­
tiins, but uniformly by their opposers. And if it were
justly chargeable upon the anti-abolitionists of the coun­
try, as is often affirmed, that they are "enemies of free
discussion, and of the liberty of s�ch and the press,"
and the " instigators and at>ologists for mobs ; " then
these lawless deeds would not as now be rare, and brief,
but multiplied and uncontrollable. The truth is, that
although the great body of the people are opposed " to •
ultra-abolitionism," even in the northern states, yet
they reverence and respect the laws, and to -this en­
ligbtened and honourable public sentiment of the ma­
jority, the abolitionists, who are every where in the
minority, are indebted for their protection in their rights,
even when they abuse them.
But let us compare the pro
fuaiom of modern aboli­
tionists with their practice, and we shall clearly see the
cauau of the unhappy excitement which now agitates the
country. They profess a design to address " argumenta
to the underatanding and conaciencu of slaveholders to
convince them of the policy and duty of immediate
emancipation." Such is their avowal of p1-indplu,
which we oow compare with their meaauru, for while
the former look barmlees, the latter are mighty for evil.
Let os Sile then what are the " arguments" addressed
to &he " uDdera�iDg and eonseience."

their professions, we proceed now _to account for their
inconsistencies and excesses, which we think may be
'eaaily done by the aid ofthose lights which both biator,.
and philosophy furnish.
Error of opinion on any subject is to be deprecated1
not merely because it is intrinsically wrong, but becau1e
of the erroneou111 e-0nduct to. which it inevitably, though
oftenunconsciously, impels its victim. This is uniformly
aod deplorably the case with error on moral and religious
1ubjects. Indeed sin in general, if not univel'llally, i•
the offspring of error or mistake. Hence " to sin," in
the Scriptures is denominated " to err from the truth; "
and Paul ascribes his forgiveness to the iiiet, that 'Ile
" did it ignorantly," ·while the Saviour on the cross,
alleges in extenuation ofthe criminality ofhis murderers,
that they " knew not what they did." In. the case of
Saul .of Tarsus, we have an appalling example 'of the
di9aatrous criminality to which an erroneous religious
c.reed constl11ios its votary.. He " verily thought;'' that
_ to " call on the name of Christ," was as ·bad aa
" ultra·abolitionists " regard 8"1.t1eholding to be ; and be
gave fearful evidence, that in his estimation, it waa
" worse than murder.'' Mark his imaginary " zeal to­
wuds God," while. he was " exceedingly mad ; " and
verily thought he wac1 " doing God service," by perse­
cution and wrath, aod malice, and evil-speaking, while
188 U L T B .l• .l B O L J T I O Jr l S JI .
his hands and his heart were guilty o( innocent blood.
And do we inquire whence this spirit and conduct, while
" living in all good conscience before God," and recog­
nised among the " straightest sect," and an the while
" more religious " than any ofhis contemporaries in his
own and their estimation 1 The amwer is found in the
error of opinion, into which he had fallen, and the ad­
ditional fact, that this error was a part and parcel of bis
religiotu creed ! Hence the excesses, guilt and crimes,
which be ever afterwards lamented, as constituting him
the " chief of sinners."
IC a striking parallel be not discovered between this
and similar histories, and the principles and measures of
modem abolitionism, in the light of reason and religion,
our knowledge of the facts of the case must indeed be
limited. It remains for us, however, still to convict
thls ultra-abolitionism with being built upon a similar
aod radical error i� religious· creed, and we address our­
selves to the task. Let truth and candor characterize
o_ur investigation.
It will scarcely be necessary for us to prove that the
whole tbeo_ry and practice of " modem abolitionism," is
built upon the " great fact " as it is called, that " the act of
1laveholding is a heinotu ci·ime in the sight of God."
" To claim, hold, and use a fellow-man as property, under
any circums•ances, is SIN .
"
This is the fotmdation stone
on which the whole fabric is erected ; and hence the.
zeal ·which impels to " compass sea and laud, ·to make
· one proselyte." So many evidences are furnished, that
this !ltupendous fallacy is the pri111um mobile ofthe entire
fl}'Stem, that we forbear to enumerate them ; nor can it
be denied or doubted by any who are acquainted with
the controversy. It only remains to prove that this is
U L T R .l • .l B O L I T I O N IS M� 169
eITor, radical error ;-and the view we bava taken of the
who!" subject will then be sustained. · We shall first
draw our proofs from relJ8on, and then f
rom religion ; and
the candid and unsophisticated reader will perceive that
this, their "great truth," is a "false fact," when measured
by either standard.
1st. There are a great variety of circumstances in
which enlightened reason and humanity not only justif
y,
but demand the continuance of" the act ofslavebolding."
And it will not surely be pretended that any circumstances
canjustify " continuance in sin," especially in " heinous
crime." We need only cite an individuaf example out
ofa great multitude, since this will as eff
ectually estab­
lish our position, and overthrow theirs, as though we
had ten thousand. And we only premise that the cases
like that named are numerous in the ·southern states ;
and though for obvious reasons the names of the parties
are withheld, yet we present no fiction, but an actually
ezisting fact, for the strict correctness of which we
pledge our veracity, and it is only one among many.
A. B. and C; D. are southern planters, each of whom
have fallen heir to their paternal estates, and they are
near neighbours.. Both of them are reputable and de­
vout Christians, and each of them is possessed ofa large
number of slaves. Several of the males belonging to
A. B. and C. D. have long since been. legally married to
the female slaves of E. F., another neighbour, and t1ice
"eraa. Each of these slaveholders therefore hold aa
property, mothers and children, whose husbands and
fathers are owned by his neighbour. A. B. and C, D.
found these ties existing when they came into possession
of their slave-property ; and though the laws ofthe state
prohibit emancipation, except they be removed from tho
15

lt&te, yet tli81 wOllld f
ain li8erate .their alavea if the7
eotdd do so conaiateotly with their moral aad reJigioue
obligatioaa. But if A. B. wo111d gi'ff freedom to hill

rate parent• from children. And if C. D. would free
the motben and children be bolds io bondage, while E.
F. ,retains the husbaads and f
atheri, a similar cruel
separation mut take place. And apart from the injas­
tice and guilt which such an act of emancipation woald
incur; these husbands and wives resolutely refuse to be
-.de free, though emancipation is offered 1hem ; and
their mutual attachments, and their affection f
or their
children are such, that all the abolitionists in the land
could not prevat
l upon them to accept of freedom on
such terms.
INt what is the voice ofreason and humanity in rela­
tion t'o duty on the part of A. B. and C. D 1 If it were
true that " the act of siaveholding is· sin," then " instant
emancipation ia duty," and this without regard to con­
sequences," for " duty belongs to us, events to God."
In the present case, the�fore, the necessity of the case
decnands, either the furcible 1eparation o
f parents and
childrm, ofhwbm.da tMd 'IDivu, or the continuance of
their bondage until E. F. shall consent to " let the op­
pte811ed go free,'' or the laws requiring removal from the
1ta.te be repealed. And should neither of these results
follow, according to " modern abolitionism" reason, and
Jeu.amty, should be outraged by tearing ·asunder COll­
jugal and parental and filial ties ; or, in accordatice with
the dictates of both reason and hmnanity, A. B. and ·c.
D. should continure to ..hold property in man." -This

guilt of " heiaoos crime." while bclth Jt11maoity and re­
l�oo, reason and Scripture decide. that alnel.okldg,
under such circumstances, becomes duty, ud abolitiott,
with such coDBeqwmces, would indeed be a " Aainour
o,rime."
But shall we now examine this sober nalTlltive offacita,
in ihe light of Christian duty, as we are taught in tta.
Scriptures ofDivine Truth. " Love to God and our neigh­
bour " is there presented as embracing " the law and
the prophets," the whole of personal and practical
religion. And as " loving our neighbour as ourselves,"
and " doing unto others as we would they should do
unto us," are given by \he Saviour as the tests of our
relative duties,- let us apply them to the case of A. B.
and C. D. as above-mentioned, and inquire which course
would be sinful according to the inspired c.riterion. Shall
they love their slaves as themselves, and tear them from
their ties of blood, against their earnest remonstrances
and tears 1 Or shall they manifest their love, by " doing
as they would be done by," and retaining them in bond·
age 1 I blush for the specimen of human nature which
can withhold the acknowledgement, that slaveholding in
such a case becomes duty, and that abolition wotild be
ain. This is the testimony ofthe heart, constrained by
tbe laws of nature and of God.
But suppqee their position, that the act ofslaveholding
ia necessarily sinful, in all cases, were sober trutba,
which is by no means admitted, although there are
many cases in which it is so, let us inquire if the means
and measures adopted on the part of"modem abolition­
ism " would then be consiatent either with reuon or
religion. Doea any •peciee ofphilosophy teach us that
deoanciatiot1 and aaatbemu are the ,,..J>ORll whieh wiU
1'72 U L T & A • A B O L I T JO !( JI X ,
correct acknowledged evils, and reform transgressors?
Will calling hard names, and the indiscriminate applica­
tion of abusive epithets, bully men into orthodoxy 1 Do
not men of reason and intelligence, from the ramparts
of common sense, laugh at such harmless thunder, and
become hardened thereby in their sin 1 Let reason and
conscience answer.
Still less may we appeal to the Scriptures of Divine
Truth, for the vindication of the characteristic spirit and
measures of modern abolitionism. The religion of the
Prince of Peace, utterly repudiates and condemns all
these carnal weapons. And should any deny or even
doubt, whether the party fall t.ftider this condemnation,
we direct attention to the official publications of the
Anti-Slavery S6ciety, under which their presses are per­
ennially groaning, all of which ab0und with exhibitions
of" bitterness and wrath," without a parallel in modem
controversy. � Does the president ofthe United States
own slaves in Tennessee- he is branded by name as a
" robber, a pirate, a .man-stealer, a villain !" Does his
successor in that high office officially announce, in a
state paper, that his constitutional sanction can ·never be
given to any law in relation to slavery, which he regards
as interfering with the constitutional rights of any of the
states -he is at once written down a " devil unmasked,"
" covered with infamy;" a " stench, in the nostrils of
honest men," and he is officially told that " though the
land rocks tDith commotion, and ron.t down with blood /'"
" not an inch will they yield, not an effort relax, not an
agent recall, not a publication suppress !" Do senators,
or congressmen, or legislators, in their places, hazard
the expression oftheir honest sentiments, adverse to the
principles Bed meuures of abolitiow11ts - the whole vo-

cabulary ofcrimination is ezhausted to coyer their namo
with " everlasting inf
amy." Do ministers of the gospel,
as Christian patriots, lift their voices in tones of remon­
strance and expostulation against what they deem erro­
neous doctrines, and pernicious practice, in relation to
slavery 1 · they are at once designated by name in the
Liberator, Emancipator, Zion's Watchman, et id genu.
omne, either as " robbers and villains," or at least " apo·
logistS for man-stealing," and classed with the " µiurder­
ous enemies ofimpartial freedom," the " implacable f
oes
ofGod and man," for whom " intense abhorrence should
fill the heart of every disciple of Jesus Christ." And
when any portion of the political or religious press, pre·
sumes to express opinions unf
riendly to these horrible
exhibitions ofintblerance, and administer merited rebuke
to these enormities, they are forthwith placed under the
ban of reprobation, charged with being " bribed by slave­
holders," called " hireling 11ycopbants," " instigators of
mobs," and their motives, integrity, and veracity, are im­
peached, while the real or suppoaed correspondents of
these editors are singled out for calumny and personal
abuse. Such are the fruits of ultra-abolitionism ; or
rather such the carnal weapons which their " hireling
editors " and agents are employing for promoting their
cause.
It is plain, then, and must be so to men of reason Of'
religion, apart f
rom the aubject.of abolitioniam, or what..
eyer such may think of slavery or anti-slavery, that &Uch
a spirit of intolerance as these examples exhibit, is " eYil,
only evil, and that continually." And. to arrest thw tor­
re1d of vituperation, to moderate these fiery zealot., i8
a work which imperi(>Usly demands that patriots and
Ct.riaaians should " throw tbemseln• into � breach,.'�

however multiplied be the " fiery arrows" to which they
may expose themselves by the conflict.
But unhappily the inf
atuation of these, our misguided
f
ellow-citizens, has not only been exhibited in these in­
tolerant and unchristian measures, but to promote their
cause, it would seem. that all consi.derations of policy
and duty, of reason and religion, are to give place to this
all-absorbing topic. The ties of kindred, the bonds of
political union, the claims of a common Christianity, as
well as every denominational and sectarian preference,
are all annihilated in this one subject of Abolitionism,­
which is with them the Alpha and Omega, the beginning
and the ending, the " all and in all." Alas ! that we are
called to witness American Christians, who are prepared
thus lo sacrifice long-cherished friendship, ardent and
sincere affection, patriotism, country, conscience, reli­
gion, all ! all ! to this visionary and necessarily fruitless
warfare against slavery ! And yet the proofs arc multi­
plied, that these fearful results are constantly and legiti­
mately flowing from the spirit of .. ultra-abolitionism."
The leaders ofthe party " disclaim all half-way men
and measures," and condemn, and reprobate " moderate
men," who, while they are avowedly with them, even
in their indiscriminate denunciation of " sla.veholdin_g as
sin," yet cannot unite with, or approve of, their spirit
and temper in conducting the controversy. Such hon­
est . abolitionlists, for example, who will not join .the
outcry against the motives, principles, and tendency of
the Ame�ic�n Colonization Society, meet with neither
favour nor quarter. Such, also, as condemn all vio­
lence, -denunciation, and personal abuse, while they
nev:ertheless pray and labour for emancipation, are ut­
terly disowned from their ranks. And those consistent
'

abolitionists who oppose all mob-fliolence, from principle,
whetherfor or against abolition, and maintain that even
bad laws are to be respected and obeyed, until they can
be altered ; all such must endure the revilings of the
whole kennel press, conducted either by black or white
abolitionists. And hence, to be recognised as .. a good
man· and true," one must be prepared to endorse all
the foul abuse, and scandalous epithets employed by the
party, whether directed again.st the " villains, robbers,
pirates, and man-stealers, who hold slaves," or the
" vile hypocrites, and pale-faced impostors of the Colo­
nization Society," or the " dough-faced, time-serving,
D. D's. ," who only object to the spirit and measures of
the party, for all these are but " defenders and apologists
.
for robbery and murder." Nay, more, they must vehe­
mently cry out in favour of the " majesty of the laws,"
when abolitionists are suffering from mob vengeance,
. but at the same time, they are to trample upon all, laws,
and rescue fugitive slaves, by a niob of blacks ahd
whites, as at Utica ; - they are to form societies for
the purpose of sending run-away slaves to England,
or Canada, in violation of state laws ; - and all this ·
" mobbing and man-stealing," is to be justified and eu­
logized, as virtuous and religious, because it is on
their side of the controversy. What a precious jewel
is consistency, and what a lamentable example have we
here of the reckless infatuation which swallows up rea­
son, conscience, and religion itself, in the great gulph of
" ultra-abolitionism." •
Will it be believed, that in the nineteenth century, we
should find Christian ministers, and churches, who unite
in changing the divinely instituted term ofChristian com­
munion, and altering the conditions of salvation 1 The
1'16 U L T R .l • .l 11 0 L I T I 0 J U I .II •
gospel itselfhas become superannuate, and must be im­
proved by these puissant ..erormera, in conformity with
their creed I Instead of being " determined to know
nothing among men, save Christ and him crucified,
they know nothing save Abolition ! " The grand inquiry
ia not " What think ye of Chrut 1 " but " What think
ye of alaf!e-lawa l " The term of Christian commun­
ion is not whether men have exercised " repentance to­
ward God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ ; " - but
whether they are " members of the anti-alaverysociety !"
Not whether they believe in " the Apostle's creed," or the
" Ten Commandments ; " but these and the whole Book
ofGod, must hold a ·subordinate relation to their perver­
sion of the maxim of Thomas Jeffe�son, that " aU
- are bot"T&f
ree and equal." To be a Christian, and
to be acknowledged as such, by these modem abolition­
ists, they must "join the Anti-Slavery Society," pro­
f
ess to have " no prejudice agaioet colour," and " re­
nounce the Colonization Society and all its works."
These are the covenants, without which none can come
to the table of the Lord, as they still call it, although
1uch neto qualifications are impiously demanded. Truly,
these religionists have invented " another gospel."
It must be obvious, that our f
athers and mothers in
Israel, who have gone to their reward from all the
churches of the North and the South, were blind, igno­
rant, and indeed wholly in the dark, since they used to
" hear slaveholding ministers preach," and " take · their
seats at the L�rd's table in company with· li!laveholders,"
either of which, according to the creed of modern aboli­
tionism, would be " beiaous erime," as bad as slave·
holding. Nay, these ·Vflrj ministers and cburchea who
aow adopt this system of proscription, but a very few
yearsago, when they were better Christiana than now, by
U L T IU. • A. 11 0 L I T I O N I S M . 177
every scriptural criterion, were thus Binning without
any, the least compunction of conscience, since they
held communion with those " who held property in_
man," and now-allege that they " kne-w notwhat they
did." If this ignorance, however, really existed, it must
have been voluntary, for the true " light" then shone as
brilliantly as now. - The recollection of their own recent
ignorance, if such indeed it was, shou:d moderate t: � : r
wrath ag11-iust those who have r;'lt been bewildlln :-. l.y
their " new light," and who o� ..l!py the precise g;c1,Dd
which they have abandoned. They.we1c neither sfove·
holders, nor apologists fo1· slavery then, and yet_ the11e
are the epithets which are applied now to those who
retain the sentiments which until lately they them-
11elves held. Hence, a minister of the gospel who stead­
fastly moves forward in his legitimate sphere, preaching
" the unsearchable riches of Christ," asking for " the old
paths and walking therein," aBd labouring to promote
" pea�e on earth, th<J glory of God, and the salvation of
souls," is excommunicated from the fellowship of the
party, unless he will join them in this strife with the
" potsherds of the earth." And should he hazard the
opinion, that the spirit ofabolitionism, as it rages around
him, is unfriendly to personal religion, and to the cause
of God, he must prepare for uumeasured reprobation
nod invective. And it is lamentable to witness. the el'l­
trangement of affection, the _ annihilation of brQtherly
love, and alas ! the open hostility, which is seen among
the private members ofthe churches, who have become
engulphed in the vortex of abolitionism. They lose all
confidence in the personal piety of ministers. and peo­
ple who diff
er from them in opinion, and even if they do
not formally abjure.fellowship with the denominatiqn or

church ofdleir choice, they do inftnitely woree, by con­
tinuing a nominal eceleaiastical connexion with tlaoee,
from whom every .estige of spiritual union is departed.
And in numero11s imtaoces,cburches which have enjoyed
uninterrupted peace and prosperity for a series ofyeuw,
have been made the arena of contention, strife, discord,
division, and disaff
ection amon
g brethren, and from DO
other cause than that some two or three indi't'iduala
have " sown the wind" on this subject, that they may
" reap the whirlwind." .
We have marked the mischiefs of abolitionism when
introQ.uced into the churches, and mourned over the
disastrous results which soon followed in its train. One
member becomes dissatisfied with his minister, becaUH
be now remembers, that he is in favour of that �/rid
" Colonization Society," and he can no longer profit by
his preaching, though he long loved and hgnoured him1
until he became a member of the Anti-Slavery Society.
Another cannot enjoy himself any longer in the church,
while " the poor coloured sisters and brothers occupy
the gallery, or the back pews," and his conscience ii
10 troubled that be must needs complain and agitate,
even when no one el�e in the churches, either white or
coloured, has any scruples or dis8atisfaction on the sub­
ject. A third goes into the Sabbath School, and clan­
destinely distributes anti-slavery tracts and " rawhead
and bloody bones " pictures on the subject ; and this
too when he knows that there are no kindred spirits
among the teachers or parents of the children, all of
whom will be grieved at this conduct, ifthe result be not.
to repel the children from the school. A fourth feela
it his duly publicly to pray for the slues, and f
or the
prosperity ofa6olitionism,at every opportunity, aDcl e-rea

in hi• pnyers, throw out e>ft'
enaive allusions to the min­
i8ter and otllors, for aeglecting this part of their Cltris­
tian obligations. And these with ·many other examples
wbidl might be named, will illustrate the methods sys­
tematically pursued by infatuated men and women, by
which the peace and harmony of churches are violated,
and often by a single individual. And instances have
occarred in which a " weak sister, or femaie brother,"
has singly persisted in this course, until the moral feel­
ings of the whole church have been outraged, and they
have convinced him or her, that the attempt to diff
use
a similar spirit was vain. He or she bas then obtained
a dismission from one church and united with another ;
and another, in each of which a repetition of the mis­
chief. has been attempted, until such disturbers of the
peace, have exhausted their power to do further harm.
In some cases, however, such movements have been
too successful, and the young and inexperienced have
become entangled in the �nare ; a party has been crea­
ted in the bosom of the church, and perpetual conflict
has been the result. The Sabbath Scboolsf and the
prayer meetings, have become little else than " abolition
conventicles ; " the minister and officers of the church,
who have resisted the mania, have been made the sub­
jects of public supplication by name ; and the faction
baa been employed in sowing dissension· and disunion,
anti!' by " smiting the shepherd, the flock have been
tcattered." Meanwhile, alas for the victims of this in­
ftltuation, personal religion has been forgotten, and that
the S'lruls of many have IJetn the forfeit, it is melancholy_
to belie'Ve is but too certain. For this spirit, like that of
ncabtr polities, seldom f
ails to be substituted in the
affiseliona, for thllt ofsober and practical godlineh.

es.
It has been long ago remarked that any and every
subject acquires an artificial and fictitious importance in
the minds and feelings of those who contemplate it e:r­
cluaifiely. And it is duty to truth here to add , that the
Creator has so constituted the human mind, that a too
constant and intense attention to any one topic, to the
partial or entire exclusion of every other, so interferes
with, and impairs the corporeal organs which are the in­
struments of thought, that the balance of the m�nd is
overthrown, and a disease denominated monomania, ia
the melancholy result• . One man has his thoughts em-
U L T R A,• A B O L I T I O N 1 8 M . 181
ployed upon " perpetual motion," and becomes so a�
sorbed in his efforts to discover this desideratum, that he
loses sight of all the won®rs of nature and art, and re­
gards every product of human genius insignificant com ·
pared with his projected invention. Another contrives
a theory, which unlocks the mysteries of some occult
science, and be becomes so swallowed up in this favour­
ite hypothesis, that he has neither time nor inclination to
· attend to the interests either of his body or his soul. A
third invents some new application ofremedies for a va­
riety of diseases, and be thi�ks of nothing else, until be
verily persuades himself that be possesses a universal
panacea, the philosopher's stone, and confidentlrpredicts
with Paracelsus, that be can secure immortality to him
self and others, and the-delusion is so sincere and entire
that it only ends with his life. A fourth selects some
one truth in religion, upon which he meditates by day
and night, until he exterminates from his thoughts every
other truth ; though infinitely more important than his .
chosen theme, and finally becomes so enamoured of his
f
avourite, that he rejects every other truth, whether of
reason or revelation. While yet another cultivates
some one benevolent object with so much ardour and
enthusilltlm, that it becomes uppermost in all his
thoughts ; nay more, bis zeal for the scheme in which
be embarks, bums with 110 much of vehemence, ·that be
not only abandons, but furiously opposes every other,
or at least insists that they are comparatively insignifi­
cant in view of his hobby. So infatuated does he pre·
sently become with the stupendous importance of accom­
plishing bis purposes, ·and in his own way too, that he
loses sight of every claim, and every obligation which
seems to hinder his success, and drives forward the
16
182 U L T a A • A B 0 L I T I 0 1'f J I � •
enterprise in which he baa elllharked hill all, with a fury
which overleaps every restraint. and defiea all control.
Fully peniuaded that his moyves are. pure, and the eud
he pursues is a good one, he pausea not to " foresee the
evil," nor is he careful of the meuis which he eu1ploys
so that they subse"e his purpos�. His is the supremo
good, - all else must be postponed to it, - and what·
ever stands in the way, whether reason or revelation,
must be trampled dowu. Such a monomaniac is pre­
pared to labour, to suffer, or to die for his cause ; he
construes all resistance lo he unrighteous persecution,
and will glory in martyrdom itself., if he can ouly hope
thereby to gain the desirable object al which he aima.
And such examples among modern abolitionists are
sufficiently numerous, to prove that this is one form of
monomania, and the victims of which should be taken
care of by their friends, as f
ar more worthy of tommiser•
ation than censure.
Let it nevt-r be forgotten, that though martyrdom is
the strongest proof of a man's sincerity, it is no proof at
all that he is right, for many have given this evidence of
sincerity who were " aincerely torong." The instance
already adverted to of Saul of Tarsus, is a striking illus­
tration in point. Nor is error less dangerous to individ­
uals and community because its votaries are Bincen ; so
far from thiS being the fact, the danger of mischief is in­
creased ju�t in proportion to the evidences of sinceri_ty
which are visible. If then it were true that all the mis­
guided men and women who are engaged in modern
abolitionism, were .so sincere that they were ready to
sacrifice their lives in its service, even then this would
prove nothing as to the merits of their cause. How
!Jll.lch more equivoclll, then, is the evidence furnished,

when· the champions of the -party are BO careful Of COD•
sequenees to their own heads, while regardless of all
consequences, when others are to be the sufferers.
Witness their readiness !o agitate the community in the
north and east, where no moral courage, or spirit of
self
-sacrifice is required, and contrast this with tJaeiT
wary canti-Oll not to trust their prEfcious selves within the
reach of harm ; either in the south, where the evil lies,
against which they are professedly labouring ; ot even in
th� north, where they have reason to apprehend that they
may be called personally to suff
er reproaeh. or pereecu­
tion. The examples ot pusillanimity, and morbid tim­
idity which some of their mightiest men have exhibited
iB proverbial. Witness the terror of a certain Rev.
divine, when pursued by a troop of boys, to the steam­
boat in which he was about to lea_ve the city of New•
York, and which induced him to crave the protection of
the ciyil authorities ; when it was obvious, that· bis pur•
suers only waited to give him a parting hiss, in token of
their contempt. Nor need we refer to Garrison be�
neath a pile of shavings, anq Thompson· in the centre of
a group of. coloured sisters at Boston. on an. equally
memorable occasion, for a more glaring instance than
either, was witnessed in the case of certain vociferoua
agents of the party, who on their return from the general
conf
erence at Cincinnati, where they bad shown their .
colours, were afraid to have their names placed on the
way-bill, lest they might fa!J into harm's way. Truly
was it said, " The wicked fleeth when no man putsireth,"
for in this latter case, their fears were who!Jy morbid
and imaginary ; no one whom they met having the pow•
er to molest them, or the inclination- to make them
. afraid.
184 V LT& .l • .6. B O L J T J O J( JI••
It U. true, and lamentably so, on more accounts than
one, that in many instances, the agents and lecturers of
modem abolitioniam have been unrighteously pe1UCUted,
aad in the f
ury of mob-violeoce, evein the innocent have
sometimes suff
ered. Nor can the lawleas violations of
persons and property which have resulted from popular
indignation, .find justification or even palliation among
the true friend• of liberty. and law. No abuse of the
liberty of Apeech or the press, can authorize the inftic­
tion of " summary punishment," in any civif
ized com­
munity ; and accordingly the actors in all riotous pr-0-
ceedings, as well as the instigators and apologists for
such mob-violence, ju&tly meet with the execration -of
the virtuous and the good. Indeed the resort to such
means even to redress real grievances, and abate actual
nuisances, is provided against by the heaviest penalties
known to our laws. Thus it ought ever to be, and the
criminal agents in these tumults should in no instance be
suff
ered to escape.
Nevertheless, while we should unqualifiedly reprobate
all lawless violence, by whatsoever pretext perpetrated, ·
every good citizen should equally condemn the course of
conduct which experience and observation have shown
either invariably or frequently results in these " deeds of
darkness. " . For surely if a mob be an evil to be depre­
cated, and the actors be regarded as criminals, we are
not at liberty to invite, ·excite, or provoke such an un­
lawful assemblage, nor can we innocently adopt a sys­
tem of measures which tends to this result. we may
regard our course as lawful in itselfconsidered, and our
motives may be purely benevolent and. praiseworthy, and
yet ifsuch oonsequences to ourselves and others, follow
in our train, it becomes both our civil and moral duty to
U L T R A.• A. D O.L I T I O N I B M . 18S
change our course, either by abandoning the object, or
if tliis be a greater evil, by changing our method ofpur­
suing it, so as to avert those consequences.
Let us illu trnte this position by a ('.ase which fur­
nishes a strong parallel, and in some points presents ,
a striking analogy. In our larger and populous cities,
vice, and immoral ity ofevery kind are known to abound,
and especially among that clas who are known to ab­
sent themselves from all the institutions and ordinances
ofreligion. l\foltitudes ofour fellow beings are " living.
without God, and dying without hope," nor are lhey
reached by any of the appointed means of instruction
and grace, b u t are literally in a state of heathenism.
Let .us appose that benevolent and C hristian philan­
thropists, commi erating the condition of such, both for
time and eternity, unite in a system of measures lo res­
cue and save these multitudes from their degraded
and melancholy condition. Their motives are good,
their object laudable, and they employ the preaching of
the gospel, and the distribution of tracts as their chosen
means. No one can deny, or doubt that they are en­
tering upon a cour e which is not only lawful, but com­
mendable, aad they have an undoubted right thus to feel
and act. But suppose they adopt the practice
·
of treet­
preachiag, or market-house preaching, and it is found
by experience, that in almost every in tance, these efforts
produce oulbreakiogs of popular violence, which disturb
the peace ofthe ity, and endanger the property and lives
of the inhabitants ; would not all the good men, much
less all the wise and prudent men among them, after a
constant repetition of these mischief.s, pause, and in­
quire whelhor they ought not to desist, and adopt some
other course more peaceable and inoffensive 1 Would
16•
186 U L T Jl A • A B0 L I T I 0 1'f I I K.
they be justified in persisting in these measures, and
vindicating themitelves by alleging tltat they bad their
right.,- that they were only using the liberty ofspeech,
and of the preu, which was guaranteed to them by the
constitution and laws 1 And would not the municipal
authorities of the city be called upon to prohibit the re­
petition ofmeasures, which however lawful and lauda­
ble in themselves, were found in practice to be evil and
only evil, and that continually 1 And when this mea­
eure of policy and duty was adopted by the constituted
authorities, could these street-preachers justly complain
�ecause they were not allowed " the liberty of speech
and the press," and allege that •• agitation " was their
object, and that every mob increased their numbers and
their resources, and that they should therefore be per­
mitted to proceed irrespective of all consequences 1
Thus far it will be perceived that we have suppo11ed alJ
the means employed to be innocent and lawful in them-
1eltes considered, but to make the parallel complete,
we must contemplate it in a diffP.rent aspect. Suppose
these street-preachers, were ever and anon denouneiog
their hearers as " thieves, robbers, pirates, and mur­
derers," and the application ofthese and the like epithets
were found to exasperate the populace ; and suppose
that the tracts they distributed were not only inflamma­
tory, and incendiary in their character, but filled with
pictures which through the eye appealed to the worst pas­
sions of the worst of men, and that such preaching anti
tracts wherever used, resulted in the destruction of the
publio peace, and the perpetual repetition of d.eeds of
lawless violence, in which the innocent often suff
ered,
- while the guilty as often escaped, either by their cunning
or skill 1 Will it be pretended that such philanthropists
l1 L T ll .A. • .A. B 0 L I T I 0 N I S Jll . 187
would be justifiable in adhering to such a course irre­
spective ofsuch consequences under the pretext of " lib­
erty," or " rights 1 " Would they not be taught that the
peaceable part of the community had rights as well as
they 1 And ought they not to surrender such of their
rights, as interfered with the rights of others, or at least
exercise their rights in some other way, which . should
not trespass on those of their n�ighbours1 We conf
ess
that such it appears to us would be the dictate both of
reason and religion. Nor can it be necessary to en­
large here in proof, that modern abvlitionism is in no
respect misrepresented by the foregoing illustration, a"nd
indeed, candour will constrain the concession, that the
parable only fails in pourtraying, with sufficient strength,
the facts of the case.
It is true, that the agents and lecturers of this party
profess, and many of them sincerely to pursue ; none
other than " peaceable measures. " Indeed, they are
ever reiterating that " erayer and the diffusion of light.''
are the only mellJlS which they authorize. If these in­
struinentalities werf1 truly all the weapons they em­
ployed, still, if their method of using them produced
" wars and rumours of wars," and was found in prac­
tice to inflict upon the community nought but public
and private mischiefs, it would be their solemn duty to
adopt ilome other method of employing these " lawful
means." But however often they may allege " prayer
and the diffusion of light " to be " the head and front of
their off
ending," it is not true, as many who make this
profession very well know. No good Christian or good
citizen, ever did oppose either " prayer,'1 or the " dif­
fusion of light ; " and yet there are tens of thousands
in both these relatioos, who are opposed to the measures
188 U L T R. .l • .l B 0 L I T I 0 N 1 9 K .
of " modem abolitionism." The truth is, these are not
the measures which distinguish the party; notwithstand­
ing they are perpetually imposing upon the public by
such questions as the following : Do not the Scriptures
require us to " remember them that are in bonds as
bound with them," why then should it be a crime to
proy f
or the poor aka"u l And " is it a sin to dijfuie
light among the people on the subject of slavery 1 "
Now eYery man knows that abolitionists might " pray
f
or the poor slaves " on every " house-top" in the noo­
slaveholding states, and there would be no '"excite­
ment " or ·� agitation " thus occasioned. They might
" diff
use light " from the pulpit and the press, to their
heart's content, and no civil tumult or riot would follow
these or any other " peaceable measures.'' But it must
be obvious, that there is a way ofemploying even " law­
ful means " in the prod�ction of " unlawf
ul eL1s." It is
thus that ultra-abolitionism bas abused " the liberty of
speech and the press," and disturbed the peace of the
community by · exciting popular tumults and violence.
The mobs in New-York, as is now universally known,
were not occasioned in whole or in part by .either " pray­
er," or " the diff
usion of light," but by an attempt at
amalgamating the races, by seating the whites and blacks
· indiscriminately in one of the churches, at a celebration
to which the public had been invited. This- unheard-of
arrangement engendered the first show of popular feel- .
ing, and hence the Chatham'.'"street Chapel was the first
scene of the civil commotion, which afterwards exhi­
bited itself in other churches, where this outrage upon
public feeling bad been committed, and also upon the
property of those who had made themselves�conspicuous
in these meetings. Indeed, it was not . until handbills
U L T B. A. • A. B 0 L I T I 0 N 1 1 M � 189
had been poated through the city, inciting the black
pop.ulationto rescue certain fugitive slaves, that the riots
actually commenced ; and but for. these and the like
meuur.es, the city had never been disgraced by the out­
rages ofpopular fury, which there is so much reason to
deplore.
In like maoner, if the history of the mobs in other and
distant places, by which the abolitionists have been dis·
pers.ed and peraecuted, could be accurately obtained, no
one of them would be found to have followed either
" prayer " or the legitimate employment of the meaDB
for diffusing light ; - but invariably they have resulted
from measures which both reason and religion condemn,
except in those few instances .where they have been oc­
casioned by political demagogues for party purposes.
It is full time, therefore, that the public mind should be
disabused of the fictitious pretence, that the " peaceable
measures " of " prayer," and the " diffusion of light,"
have been resisted by mo.b violence, and the " innocent
abolitionists " have been cruelly persecuted, solely for
" righteousness' sake." And the reader need only ac­
quaint himself with the facts in the case, in relation
to any future riotous proceedings in any place, and
we venture to predict, that other than the " peaceable
means " of " prayer, and the diffusion of light," will
have been the precursors and provocatives of the vio­
lence. The truth should be known, even though they
who testif
y it should do so- at the expellBe of being un­
justly charged with being apologists for mobs. Their
causes and causation, are subjects too important to be
misunderstood by any citizen who reverences the au­
thority of the laws, and deprecates their violation. All
such should unite in shunning the causes, which _experi-
190 'U L T R .&. • .&. B O L J T l 0 1' I B M .
ence and observation have shown, are liable to prove tile
iostigati09 of IJlwless violence. It ought, however, to
be fixed in the public mind, that mobs are to be reproba­
ted not because of their being employed against aboli­
tionists, but because of their own intrinsic vileness ; and
that all popular tumult arid violence, in which people of
any class, or for _any purpose, act without law, or above
law, are disgraceful to any civilized community, and de­
serve the heaviest penalties. Let it never be forgotten
or overlooked, thai while mobs are tolerated, there is an
end both to law and liberty ; and hence the guardians of
the public weal, are bound to prevent and suppress them,
_by the highest obligations, and at any sacrifice, whether
· oftreasure or of blood. ,
But have not the leaders of modem abolitionism, while
justly appealing to earth and heaven against mobs, pub­
licly and officially sanctioned and recommended them,
on their own side ofthe question 1 What is a mob 1 It
is an attempt on the part ofany number of people, either
to make la'llJ, or t9 f!iolate law, or to act t11ithout law, and
it is a high crime under any government of la1ts.
Whether the laws are just or unjust, every citizen is
bound to obey them, until they can be altered ; and that,
not by mob violence, but in a constitutional way. The
constitution and laws of the American Union, and of the
several states, provide for the restoration of fugifrfe
slaves, and prescribe the process by which it is to be
eff
ected. Now, whether or not we · believe in " the
right of property in man ; '' this is one question, and the
f
act that the laioa recognise that " right," is .another.
This last fact alone, forbids any good citizen from re­
sisting those laws, and characterizes all co�binations for
the purpose as mobs. And be it remembered, that a
U L T R A. • A B O L I T I O ·N I S M . 191
mob is no less a mob because it is employed in rescuing
a ·slave from his master, or from the officers ofjustice,
while in tho act of investigating his true relation, than if
it wrui employed in dispersing a company of abolit ionists.
All unla.wf�I proceedings ia either ca e, am equally crim­
inal ; nor is the professed benevolence of the design
any plea in its mitigation ; else all rioters might nllcge
good mul ives in exte nuation of their outrnge . fodeed
the only defence which hardihood and wicket!ne ho.s
had the effrontery. !o urge in behalf of mobs, fa t hat there
are some e vils agninsl whi h there is no law, or bad
laws, and that in the absence of law, they ought to be
punished liy su mmary proce s. Such is the horrid creed
on which " lynching " has been prncti ed, as it is tech­
nical ly termed, and io the l ight of rea oa and com­
mon sense., it is plain, that there is no other creed which
can excuse the resistance to the laws, which the aboli­
tion party are currying out, by sending fugitive slaves,
when known to be uch, to England or Canada ; and es­
pecially by prompting their seizure and rescue while
under due proce s of law. It is no ex tenuation for them
to deoy that the l aw is right, or just, so long as it is the
law ; nor is it any excuse for unla'.iYful measure to
allege, that the accused slave is really free a they
think, and has been kidnapped. Let them defend hi.s
case, and see that he is protected from wrong ; but still
the -law should take its cours e , for it were better, hor-
. rible as is the alterna tive, that a freeman bould be en-
laved, than tbnt a government oflaws should be tramp·
led under foot. Such must be the impartial and con­
sistent opposition to mob , before we can hope for their
annil1illltion. It would be ea y to show, however, that
the av?wed creed of modem abolitionism, is the Jcgiti-
192 11 L T a .A. • .A. B 0 L I T I 0 I' 1 8 Jf.
mate source of lawless violence. For what other pur­
pose are we over aod again taught in the official publi­
cations of the party, that " all those laws now in force,
admitting the ri!Jht of slavery are, before God, null atad
"oid 7 " Such jacobinical doctrines are enforced by the ·
oft repeated maxim, in relation to the forcible rescue of
f
ugitive slaves, that " ruialance lo tyrant. ii obedierice
to God." These are the dogmas of the party, and they
are employed for the purpose, and with the eff
ect of
prompting the forcible rescue of fugitive slaves from the
officers of justice, while in the act of investigating such
c�11 by due process of Jaw. And we need not.pause
to argue in proof that every such forcible rescue, as welt
u every clandestine assistance · rendered to a fugitive
slave to escape from his lawful master, is a piactical and
criminal example of " lynch-law," as dangerous and
mischievous u any of those of which abolitionists are
the victims. For it is certainly as bad to mob u sla'fe­
holder, as to mob an abolitionist ; and to deprive him of
hi1 slave property without due process of Jaw, can only
be justified upon the code of Judg� Lynch. It is fuH
time, then, that the public should be called upon to be­
stow their censure upon mobs indiscriminately, whether
they be gotten up by abolitionists, or their opposers.
Thus, aud thus only, can a healthy and sound public
sentiment be created on this important subject.
Among the most plausible humbugs ofultra-abolition­
ism, and perhaps that by which shallow thinkers among US
are the most egregiously gulled, is aeen in the clamor the
party are attempting to raise against the Congress of the
United States, by vociferating with all the vehemence
of the sect, that •• the sacred right ofpetition is denied,
and the whole population of this country thus reduced to
u L T a A. • A. B o. L I T I 0 N J IJll . 193
the condition of slaves.'' The f
acts of the case are
br�fty these :· ·Year after year, memorials and petitions
against slavery, in the D istrict or Territories, or against
the introduction of Texas into the U n ion, or against the
domestic slave-trade between the several slates, have
been deluging the tables of our national legislature,
signed by �nultiludes of women aud chi ldren, while and
coloured, and in one Ol' more instances signed by slav es.
These have hecn quietly laid ot1 the table in conse­
quence oftbe mor!Ji<l seosibility ofthe southern members,
into which they have been provoked or inti midated, by
the violent and fet'ocious spiri t of the ultra-aboli tioni ts.
During the present session of Congress, the party, by
dint of systematic agencies all over the North and East,
have gotten up a gre ater multitude than ever of such
petitions ; and although mo t of them are signed by illy
women, and sillier men, and many of them by "ladies
and gentlemen of colour," ns well as by Sabbath-school
children, both white and coloured, their numbers and
Jong array of names have " frightened " some of the
Southern Senators and member of the House of Rep­
resentatives " from their propriety ;" and the excitement
which the presentation of such petit ions occasioned,
threatened to embarrass seriously the legi. lation of the·
nation, and impelled a large portion of the southern
men to conte mplate a secession from the Hou e in a
body. Under such circumstance , a large majority of
lhe Congress, agreed u pon a pacific measure of com­
promise, by laying such petitions on the table, without
their being read, referred, or debated ; and the adoption
of this resolution has been the signal for a hue and cry
all over the land, that the '" right of petition " is denied.

not so stupid us not to k now that such petitions convince
nobody, and must necessarily fail in their profes ed

homely phrase, " to keep the pot boiling,'' their nlal
object is go.ined. And accordingly their whole cou rse
has been ma rked by ingenious devices, to introduce
some new topic of excitement as fa!lt as the old ones
burn out, and their influence subsides. They invent
new hobbies, - such as " mobs," " liberty of the pre ,
"
" right of petition," " Texas," and the> like, - which
necessarily answer the purpose of humbuggiog the popu­
lace ; and as these c ea-se to he operative, they adopt
another. The present reigning humbug of the party, ii
the " tragedy at Alton," and the martyrdom of Lovejoy,
to which we now direct the attention of the reader.
While these pages are preparing for the pre s, a mel­
ancholy circumstance has tran pired at Alton, Illinoi ;
of which the aboli tion pres es and lecturers, are every
where availing themselves, in a manner which exhibits
another striking confirmation, that their whole theory and
pmctice is a base imposture upon public credulity, and
eminently deserves to be denominated a humbug.
While at the same time, the history of this affair, which
ha.s re ulted in the violent d ath of Ir. Bishop and Mr.
l!..wejoy, fully su tnins the views we have expressed of
the n ture and tend ncy of ultra-abolitionism.
The essential facts of thi tragedy at Alton, mn.y be
thus brielly condensed.
lH V l. T S .&. • A. B O L I T J O K U • ·
Mr. Lovejoy, tbe o.tensible agent in the entire tnm­
action, which baa infticted ao foul a disgrace upon the
nation, wu ao editor ofa political .,-per, formerly pub·
lilbed at St. Louis, in �i.uouri. Some time !'ince, be
became a Congregational minister, and an immediate
abolitionist. By reason ofsome off
ence to the populace,
at St. Louiil, which is in a slave state, by articles pub­
liahed in his paper, he was forcibly driven from MiSBOuri, -
by an unprincipled mob, who thus outraged his person
and property because of bis alleged abolitioru
sm. - Mr.
L. being a fanatic on thia particular subject, r.esolved to
triumph over the citizens of Missouri, by issuing his
paper across the river, at Alton, Illinois ; which being
in a free state, he hoped would allow him to do what be
pleued in the premises. But before he could find f
avour
or patronage cv�n � Alton, be was obliged to gi\"e assur­
ance_ that he was about to publish atrictly a religious
paper, _in contradistinction from an abolition paper u
heretofore. Not that the inhabitants ofAlton were " pro­
slavery men," nor that they were " enemies of free dis­
cussion,'' nor " opposed to the liberty of speech or
the press," although these and -similar allegations have
been f
alsely cast upon them ; but so immediately adja­
cent is their residence to the slave state, whence Mr.
Lovejoy had been so r6cently driven by mob-violence,
tliat they apprehended that their QWn property and lives
might_ be �ndangered, should the matter and -manner of
the former paper of Mr. Lovejoy be persisted in by
him, and published at Alton. So aoon therefore as they
received the as1mrance that the character of bis paper
was to be changed to one strictly religious, and that no
attempt .was to be made to tenew the war upQD their
alaveholding neighbour• in Missouri, they welcomed
l
I

Mr. L. among them, and-resolved to rally around him
and his new press. But although Mr. L. was doubtless
sentimental in his promises when he made them, yet hia ·
infa.tuatloq on this particular subject was goaded by the
promptings of the party at home and abroad, until he
violatpd his pledge, and his " Observer," became a
more violent abolition paper than he had ever published
in Missouri. The result of his censoriousness and
obnoxious epithets, was. to arouse the worst passions of
the worst men, and bis press was abruptly destroyed,by
a lawless mob, probably-made up of visitera from Mi...
soui:i, _ who had crossed the river for the purpose of
uniting with the lower classes 'of the people of AltoD..
The quiet and oi:derly citizens, indignBDt at the outrage
which they deplored, and dreading its repetition, remon-
1trated with Mr. L. against the violation ofhis veracity,
of which they were the witnesses, and entreated him to
change the course 'of his paper, as he had promised to
do, aQd then all would yet be well ; but he only alleged
that he bad altered his mind sinee be ma� the promiae
to desist, and that now he was resolutely bent upoa
going on. He forthwith published an appeal to the
party abroad for the means to re-establish his press, and
very soon he recommenced his publication, and renewed
bis assaults upon slavebolding. Again and again WU
the peace of the community of AI_ton violated by a mob•
who a _second and a third time destroyed the press and
printing materials, and subsequently inflicted brutal in­
humanity upon Mr. L., and even upon hi!I . wif
e, who
sought to rescue him f
rom the fiendish violence of the
rioters. Again did the citizens of Alton, almost m
fAOlle, while they reprobated the mob, beseech Mr. L.
no longer to subject them to the miacbiefa of mob-Jaw,

wise hall nghla equally dear to them, and which his •
1.'
course
'
was placing in jeopardy. Hence they wished
.
him to desist fromthat course, and exercise his own rights
in some other way, which would not trespass upon
t,Jieirs. At first he seemed to listen to their counsel,
and it appeared a lucid interval of his frenzy had super-
yened, after so repeated cruelty and persecution. In-
deed there can be little doubt that he would have aban-
doned the project of re-establishing his press at Alton,
bad not the anti-slave� party, its agents and misguided
zealots from abroad, urged and demanded a diff
erent
course. Unhappily, he had bad advisers, whose code of
morals disregards " all cireumstances;" and prompts to
a recklessnes.s of " all consequences," so long as they
themselves are kept out of harm's way. Upon these
bad advisers, whether they be residents of the state of
Illinois, where the subsequent tragedy was enacted ; or
whether they be, as has been affirmed with great plausi-
bility, the black and white fanatics who constitute the .
Executive Committee ofthe American Anti-Slavery So-
ciety at New-York ; upon these bad advisers rest both
the guilt and _folly of urging the unfortunate Mr. L. to a
course- contrary to his own better judgement. The
proofs are before the world, that he yielded to importu-· .
nity urged from aom& quarter, and only thua adopted the
plans, which in their consummation resulted in his death.

kindred spirits, armed with guns and amunitioo, and
pledged to each other to carry their point, and establ ish
their press, at the point of the bayonet. Nay more, we
find Ibis rev. clergyman and his associates, furnished
with gun-powder and ball, with muskef.'3 and rifles, and
prompted to use them in def

fired into the crowd when Mr. Bishop was shot, as

That Mr. Lonij_oy, or an1 other man, woald be lcgallf
empowered, when hia castle wu aaaailed by mob-Y�
lence, to defend him.elf by any amount of f
orce which
may be neceuary for the purpoae, and that aay jury of
tbU country would render a verdict ofjustifiable homi­
cide, should he kill any of the rioters in such a case, can­
not be doubted. But unfortunately there can be no
analogy here, for want of parallel in the cases. Had
Mr. Lovejoy been peaceably occupying his dtoelling or
laia prinling o
.IJU:e, and had he there been assailed, aod
hia property and life threatened, he would have been
justified by lato, had he defended himBelf with any weap­
on be could command, and at any expense of life to
his uaailants. But instead of this, we find him clan­
deatinely introducing into a toarehatue, a printing preu
OD 1torage, and taking pouession of that warehouse
with a company ofarmed men, for the premeditated, de­
liberate, and avowed purpose ofre-establishing bis news­
paper byf
orce, and at the huard of hia h
'f
e and the li11u
of011&.,... This course rendered him the assailant of
the public peace, and hia chaUmge of defiance thua
thrown out, was calculated to inflile and pr""oke a mob,
••pecially when be had repeated proofs that there we{e
• in that community corrupt and wicked men, who were
.rioters of a desperate character, aod by whose revenge
be had over and again suff
ered. And when the mob
bad been collected, and the surrender of the press bad
been dem�nded, before any violence had been committed
other than threats, and throwing of stones, it appeara
tltat " one of Mr. Lovejoy's party, toith. the cOR1mi of
lhll rut," fired into the crowd, and Mr. Bishop wu
killed ; and 'this deed was done, as appears by the testi­
mony, by Mr. L. him1ol
f! It was not until thia murder
_ _ _ ..._
' U L T R A. � A. B O L I T I O N I S.M . 201
was committed, that the rioters rallied with fire arms, -
resolved to avenge his death ; and as one of them was
· ascending a ladder for the purpose of firing the ware­
how;e, Mr. L., it appears, came out of the hou e, a nd
in the a d of shooting th e incendianJ he was himsel f shot
down. This second murder, was the consequence of
the first, and bo�h are equally worthy of the highest pun�
ishment lrnowo to our Jaws. The mob tcithin the
house, nod the mob wilhou.l the house al ike deserved to
be hanged , since no amouut of provocation can palliate
the guilt or inlamy of either.
But by fur the vilest humbug yet practi ed u pon the
gullible public, is in the attempt made with o much
pomp and circumstance to canonize this Mr. Lorejoy
as a Christi-1I1 martyt·, while Mr. Bishop, whom he
killod but a few minutes before he fe ll, hns oo share
in the sympathy of tho party. lo New-York, where
" this ball was set in motion," the renowned Beriah
Green ! pronou nced a funeral oration, in which he not
only claimed M r. Lovejoy as a martyr, comparing him
to the illustrious Stephen ; - but he was guilty of the
horrid impiety aod bla phemy of reiterating over and
over agaio, that his death Will! tJicarious ! like thal of
Jesus Chri.it, be sulforod fo1· 11b', - he died in our stead !
" When brother L. fell," said he, " we fell, and wh�n
he died, we died." This red oubtable orator forgot that
his brother Lovejoy died, thiralinufor the bloud of hi&
enemies ! while Stephen prayed " Lord, lay not this sin
to their charge !" and his Master said, " Futher forgive
them, they know not what they do !" Look on this pie·
tore, - and then on that !
fo reviewing this whole subject, the candid reader
will perceive that the Rev. Mr. Lovejoy in writing and
t02 U L T R A • A B O L I T I 0 1' 1 8 M .
printing b is sentiments only exercised his civil and moral
rights ; and bad he perished by violence while persisting
in the exercise of those rights, without resisting force by
force, and rendering evil for evil, be would have been
indeed a martyr ; and one wb06le blood would have cried
from the ground against his murderers ; nor would the
cry have been unheeded, for the moral power of this
whole n'tion would have been concentrated for their
arrest, trial. and pu11ishment. Such should have been
his course, in consistency with his principles as an abo­
litionist ; · a member of the Peace Society ; a Christian ;
and above all, as a Minister ofthe Gospel of the Prince
of Peace. He might have been kill1:1d, but be would
have killed nobody. He might have died, but not with
murderous weapons in his bands, already stained with
the blood of one of his fellow-being8, and in the act of
slaying another of his enemies. He might then have
been a martyr, and not, as now, the victim of his inf
at­
uation, and an enduring monument of ·those maxims of
eternal retributive justice,-." He that sbeddeth man's
blood, by man shall bis blood be shed." " Whatsoever
mete ye rneasure to others, it shall be measured to you
again." How like the example furnished in the hi11tory
• of Ahab, when God said by the mouth of his prophet,
l• Jo the place where the dogs licked the blood ofNaboth,
shall the dogs lick thy blood, even thine."
· But while the death of Lovejoy suggests such reftec­
tions, the death of Bishop is not less important in our
estimate ofthis tragedy. The latter was at least in bad ·
company,- possibly one ofthe r_ioters, - and if so, went
into the affray, with unlawful purposes ; and he, together
with all who constituted the mob, must have known that
the desperation of the conftict on both aides, hazarded
U L,T JI. A • A B OL I T I 0 N I S Jll , 203
the lives of all engaged in it. It may be true, that be
violated no Christian·profession,.....,. no pledge to a Pell(le
Society, � and did not even pretend either to fear God, or
regard man.; yet all this should not be construed as pal­
liating the guilt of combining with a. law less mob, to
punish by brute force, offences which could not be visited
by the laws of the land. Mr. Bishop excluded himself
from the protection of law, by uniting with a band of
outlaws, in the commiss ion of an un lawful act. And
however we may condemn the Christian minister who
shot him down, ho perished under circumstances which
excl ude him from the sympathies of those who honour
and re pect the government of Jaws, and the constitution
under which they live. No olber estimate of a mob, or
those who compose it, should find countenance or sup­
port in any quarter.
That two of our fel low-citizens should thus perish by
violence, however, is on event which demSTids of every
lover of liberty, that he look the facts in th11 face, and act
in view.. of those facts, irrespective of any party. The
guilt and responsibility ofthis outrage upon human rights,
and of similar offences against the majesty of the laws,
involves a fearful responsibility somewhere. The abo­
litionists are ever alleging the existence of slavery aa
the cause of these lawless acts ; but whi le slavery con­
tinues to be protected by the constitution and laws, such
an allegation is vain, since it involves them in the guilt of
" re isling the powers that be, which are ordained ofGod."
The lawful exi tence of slavery, while it continues, caa
never juslify or excuse unlawful opposition, much less
can it be justly alleged a any ca use of mobs. We must
look elsewhere, then, for the cau e of the disturbances
ofthe public peace ; nor shalJ we find an example among
0 L T B .l • .l B O L I T I 0 1' U H .
what are called abolition riot&. which does not, as in the
present cue, bear on its front the palpable evidence that
the " bitterness and wrath. and evil speaking " of aboli­
tion agents or presses, baa been the immediate, tjficieal,
and pro:l:i;n6le cauae of mobbing, 'by arousing the worst
passions of the worst men. In the present instance,
however, tile Rev. Mr. Lovejoy, contrary to his better
judgement, and in violation of his conscience, by foreign
dictation, provided and employed deadly weapons with
which to challenge, provoke, and def
y, mob vengeance ;
and this he did at the instance or evil counsellors at -
home and abroad, under the pretext that be wae right
and they were wrong ; and intending to compel the
wicked mob to do right, by terrif
ying, wounding, and:
killing them !
If, then, Mr. Lovejoy and those who advised, aided,
or abetted him in those measures, are not the true and
only causes of this tragedy, it is plain that we may seek
(or the cause in vain. Had they not armed themselves,
there would have been no firearms used. Had not
Mr. Bishop been killed, nobody would have been killed.
Hence the cause of Lovejoy's death, <vas the- death of
Bishop. The cause ofthis death, was the firearms in-­
troduced into the warehouse, and the use made of them
by Mr. L. and his friends. And the cause of this rash
and desperate measure, was the resolute purpo$e to
compel the people of Alton . to submit to Mr. Lovejoy
·and his brother abolitionists, to do. as they pleased.
That tho mob were wholly in the wrong, in every in-­
stance, as all other mobs are, is undeniable. · And the
nme reasons which prove them to be so, will establiah
the position that Mr. L. and his f
riends were equally in
.the wrong. The mob were acting above law and with-
U L T ll A• A B 0 L l T 1 0 N 1 8 l!I . 205
out law, for the purpose as they allege of correcting an
evil, for which there was no law. The party who armed
against the mob were doing precisely the same thing ;
they wero attempting to carry thei r point by violence,
which they were unable to effect by law. And it is
no excu e to allege, either that the ad m inistrators of
the law were weak and pusillanimous, or that the Jaw
was insufficient for lack of the supports of public opin­
ion, or that lhere was no Jaw adequate to remedy the
evil they we re suffering:; for in either case, the atlempt to
supply the absence of law, by taking the law into their
own hands was u n lawful, and the consequences which
followed, are at once the measure and the proofs of their
just respon ibility.
For professing C hristians and ministers of the gos­
pel of peace lo canonize and apotheosize E. P. Love­
joy therefore as a Clu-Utian mm·lyr is, we repeat it, an
exhibition of impiety, little short of blasphemy. Such
religio us observances would not be a greater humbug,
if they should be gotten up in our chu rches, to com­
memorate the death of d uellists ; or the combatants who
come to their death by an u nlucky blow, given at a prize­
fight between fencers, pugilis ts, or boxers, who exhibit
their science in a ring, at a shill i ng a head . All those
fall in the exercise of their rights, and in defence of these
" rights." But they " die a s the fool dieth," un d they
should have " the burial of an ass ! "
And now it only remains to expose the imposture, by
which it is attempted to force an analogy between the
great and good temperance enterprise, and this scheme
ofultra-abolitionism. We have already shown, in another
place, that the former utterly disclaims and repudiates
every form of ultrai.sm, and for this reason, if there were
18
JOf 11 L T R J. • J. B O L I T I O ! U I • •
no others, there can be no semblance ofparallel between
the Temperance and Anti-Slavery SocietieR. Neverthe·
leu, the partizaus and preSBes of this latter humbug, are
eYer reiterating that their measures are justified, by the
BUCCess and usefulneSB which have altendeci the etforta
of the friends of Temperance, as though there were an1
similarity between them. It may, therefore, be worth
whileto point out more distinctly, the features ofdissimi­
larity which it will be seen are great and multiform.
To form an Anti-Slavery S?ciety in the bosom o(any
church, for example, It is alleged is a measure which
i3 def
ensible on the same ground that a Temperance
Society can be vinclicated, viz. : that there is a necessity
for it among the member� of that church. But the dif
­
ference consists in the fact that Anti�Slavery Societies
are only formed in those churches where there is t10
"8T111aolding among their number11; - while Temperance
Societies are formed in those churches in which there
are members who either manufacture, sell, or use into:id­
cating liquors as a beverage. Those who unite with
the latter society in the church, agree that henceforth
they will practise " total abstinence," however moderately
or temperately they may have used intoxicating liquors
previously ; and they do this, for the sake of giving
their example against the causes and practice of intem­
perance. While those who unite with the Anti-Slavery
Society, when formed in any church, have no slaves
themselves, and can give no exa,nple of emancipation.
They sign their names to a constitution declaring " slave­
boldiog to be a heinous crime," and'thus as f1£r as in lhem
lies, un-church llnd etema
:lly undo every one of their
Christian brethren who bold slaves under any .circum­
stances. But SQ far from emancipating any slave, or
encouraging and prompting others to do so, they do by
U L T R A - ..l B 0 L I T I 0 N I 8 M • :iil07
this act only delay and hinder the good work of eman­
cipation ;. and they do worse, since they strengthen and
perpetuate the evil of slavery. They neither " let the
oppressed go free," nor suffer those to do so, who other­
wi e woul<I.
No one a n fail to s e e from these brief remarks, tho t
the two societies are es entially unlike. The one
contains a company of men who, for the purpose of
discouraging intem perance, and promoting temperance,
voluntarily relinqui h all U8e of intoxicating liquor as 11
beverage, and persuade others to adopt the l ike absti­
nence. The other i compo ed of tho e who live in a
state where they cannot hold slave , if they would ; and
who organize for no other purpose, as shown in practice ,
than t o denou nce a n d anathematize their fellow-citizen
and fellow-Christians in a distant state, without regard to
the law under which they live, or the circumstances, often
ofncce ity or benevolence, u nder which they hold slaves.
But when d id the .llmel·icrm Ttmperancc Society pro­
claim all use of intoxicatiog liquors u " hcinou crime
against God 1" Wbea d id they denounce against all
who continue in the traffic or use of these articles,
" without regard to circumsta nce ," such epithet .as
" thieves, pirates, men· tealers and villians 1" When
did they threaten or endanger the peace of commu-
• nities, or menace the overthrow of our national e ist­
ence 1 When did they prompt to deeds of violence
and blood, and officially sanction the use of carnal
weapons in the promolion of thei r cause 1 When did
they deluge l he tables of Congre s with petitions signed
by silly women, nod si llier men, and children of the Sab­
bath- cbool , both whit,e and coloured, until the di olu­
t ion of our Americ n Union h� come to be deprecat d
as the re uh of such folly 1 When did they raise a boo
t08 U L T "& .6. • .6. B O L I T I O • l l K·
and cry about the " liberty of speech, the liberty of the
preu, the right ofpetition, &c." u though they hopecl te
humbug the public into the beliefthat they w�re suffering
unrighteous and unmerited privation of their right.. 1 The
truth is, that bad the American Temperance Society
been conducted in the spirit and by the mt!aSures which
have thus far marked the history of the American Anti­
Slavery Society, its very name would have become an
off
ence in the nostrils of American Christians, if it had
not been long since, self
-immolated by its own rashness
and folly.
The temperance enterprise is pacific in its principles,
kind in itit spirit and measures,rational andscriptural in its
appeals, and has continued to bring " Glory to God in the
highest, on earth peace, and good will to men." While
the Anti-Slavery enterprise is founded upon erroneous
and fallacious principles, which are carried out by meas­
ures of strife, violence, and denunciation, offensive and
calumuiom:1 appeals, and bas scattered " firebrands, ar­
rows and death," throughout the church and the nation.
No slave has been, or ever will be emancipated by its
. instrumentality, though professing to he e:rclwit!d!J Anti­
SJavery ; while millions, in both hemispheres, are the
living witnesses ofthe fruits ofthe American T�mperance
Society. In the name, then, of every species of sense,
which is entitled to respect, we protest against the at­
tempted analogy between these two societies, which are
as unlike as light and darkness, and as distant from each
other in spirit and tendency, as heaven from hell. Let
the public no longer be either deceived on the subject,
or silent under this mo11t flagrant of humbugs.
Having thus examined somewhat at length, the theory
and practice, the principles and the measures of ultra­
a�litionism, the reader may .form bis own opinion of the
U L T R A- A B 0 L I T I 0 N I 8 M � , 209
character of" THE AME.RICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SocIETY,"
since this institution is itself the most gigantic imposture
which ever afHicted either the church or the state. This
society is the gre,at parent of all the humbugs, which
have been enu merated in this chapter, and which are
classified under the general title of ultra-abolitionism.
And this commentary on its principle and res ults, to­
gether wilh the catalogue of its mischiefs, misde meanors,
and crimes, has been presented for the purpose of show­
ing that the " American Anti-Slavery Society,' js itself
a stupendous humbug, and deserves the conspicuous
place assigned it in this gallery of the " Hu mbugs of
New-York."
But jt is time to conclude this chapter, which is al­
ready too long. And we would now submit the views
we have expressed to the patient and candid attention of
American Christians, with no other desire than that the
men of reason and religion among u·s may be led there­
by to judge righteous judgement, on subjectswhich very
closely pertain to our national prosperity, and the per­
petuity of our civil and religious liberties. Let us all
" seek peace and pursue it ; " and by culti vating a spirit
of calm inquiry and mutual forbearance, wo may look
the subject of Ja very in tbe face, in all its bearings ; and
whatever may be our convictions of d uty, " let our mod.
eration be known unto all men." No pos ible good
can result from violence, denunciation, and invective ;
much Jes from sophistry and declamation. God will
prosper tho righteous cause, and ultimately it will be
found, thal '' truth is mighty and will prevail." That
all who speak and write on this great subject should
find the " more excellent way " is of infinite importance,
and that such may become the case, all the Christians
in this land should devoutly pray. 1s•

THts is the third of the Antis, yclept Anli-Popery in
common parlance, which we c1ass among the humbugs
of the times, for the obvious reas.on· that both F'opery
and Anti-Popery are impostures upon the public, as we
think will be apparent to the reader, if he will extend to
thes.e strictures his patient attention.
And here .we wish it djstinctly understood, that aa
with Intemperance and Slavery, so we have no fellow­
ship with Popery. We are aware, however, that this
disclaimer will av�il us little with either class of the .ul-
I
U L T R A. •P R O T E S T A N T I S J!I . 211 .
tras of whom we have spoken. They who go beyond
the Bible, in their creed, can _scarcely be expected to
pause in their career to estimate _the motives or appre...
ciate the character of those who tarry behind on Bible
gro und. n is not for their sa ke, ho wever, that we thus
premise o u r utter boslil ity to Popery, as we have done
to Slavery and lmte mperance ; but we do �o that no
reader mny misinterpret our strictures to imply that we
are unfrie n dly to the profes ed objects of those whose
mea'me we <lepl ore and c ondemn. The only reward
we o;;:pect from the whole tribe of ultraists is, that of be­
ing called a wine bibber, a slaveholder, o r a semi-Pa­
pist. A ad though we should abhor ou rselves io either
of these characters, yet none of these lhings move us
from the fearless and conscien tious discharge of duty.
\Ve could wi h, however, that the fraternity would meet
our arguments with some other l ogic than ha rd nttmes,
unless, indeed, this be the nature of all thei r defensive
a m m u m twn. T hey may indeed impeach the charita­
bleness of this fear, yet unless their policy be changed,
they will not read ily i mpugn its ju tice.
By ul tra- Protestants, we mean those who in their op­
position to Popery go beyond the Bible in their princi­
ples and meas u res, and we are µained to confess that
all the anti-papery societies of w hich we have any
knowledgt!, and all their publicatious which we have
see n , fall und r th i coudemnntiou.
That the disti nc tive characteristics of the Roman
Catholic Religion , aro anti-American and anti-Cbri tian
we cordial ly ad mit ; and we view the whole sy stem of
Popery to be corrupt, demomJiziag, infnmou_, and false.
lVo regard the P pe, and his minions of every grade, to
lie tho instruments in a wide- pread conspiracy against
212 U L T & .l • P & O T S I T .A. ft T I I K .
human liberty, and the truth of God ; nor do we com­
plain at the application of the prophetic nomenclature
of the Bible to this " Anti-Christ " personified. Nay
more, we fully believe that the falsehood, the arro­
gance, the despotism, the stupendous frauds, cruelties,
and abominatioDB of Romailism, have been demonstra­
ted, by a mus of testimony, which can neither be refu­
ted nor gainssyed. And yet we acknowledge, with hu­
miliating views ofour common human nature, that there
is a manifest increase of Roman Catholics in our own
country, by causes which we have no mean8 to control ;
and we deprecate this calamitous result, and would la­
bour and pray for its remedy.
NevcrtheleS"s, we are not prepared to adopt the doc­
trine that " the end sanctifies the means," nor to pursue
measures which will give courdenanco to the " slander­
ous report," that we " do evil that good may come.''
Much as we desire the extinction of Popery, we would
not be accessory to effecting even this valuable object by
persecution, intolerance, or any species of Jesuitism.
These features of character posse1111 far greater defor­
mity in our eyAs when they appear in a Protestant, than
when they are exhibited in a Papist. In the latter they
are consistent, and homogeneously belong to bis charac­
ter and to his religion, and therefore we hate Popery,
and love to hate it, Nor is Protestantism any. " more
lovely or of good report" when it is disfigured and de-
fonned by exhibitions of this same spirit ofintolerance
' 1.,
and persecution.
To expose and denounce the errors and imposture•
of Popery, or any other system of(alse religion, is alike
the province and the duty of Protestants and Christians ;
and in inculcating the truth of God distinctively, it ofien
U L T B .&.• P R O T ,E S·T .&. 11' 'l' I S M . 213
becomes n�casary to eihibit the " devices of Satan,"
and the various " refuges of lies" in contrast; by way
of warning and instruction. Thus did Christ and his
Apostles ; and they who adhere to their example will
never, in their principles or measufes, deteriorate into
ultraism, for we call nothing by this name which does
not go beyond the Bible.
But the late organized and systematic movements in
opposition to Popery, and the present aspect of that por­
tion of the periodical press which is devoted to this con­
troversy, betrays a spirit which we denominate ultraism.
For while the Bible authorizes us to " contend earnestly
for the faith," and to be " valiant for the truth," and
enjoins upon us to be " faithful," to the souls of men,
yet it permits no " carnal weapons," and absolutely for­
bids us to render " railing for railing." Nay more, in
our efforts to do good, we are expressly enjoined to have
the " spirit of meekness," io do " good for eyil," to
" love our enemie.s, to bless and curie not." And to
try ourselves and others, we have this criterion fur­
nished, " If any man have not the spirit of Christ, be is
none ofhis."
If the · present war against Popery were carried on
solely by politicians, and for secular purposes, we should
suffer " the potsherds of the e11rth, tl> strive with the
potsherds of the earth," nor would we interfere with the
quarrel, however ultra its spirit. But when Christian
ministers and the members of Christian Churches are
rallying their brethren to the banner of ultra-protestant­
ism, we would fain bid t.hem pause and inquire whether
they have not gone beyond the Bible, under the influ­
ence of a zeal which is not according to knowledge.
As example11 ofultraism in this cootroversy, we would
214 V L T a A.• P ll O T & l!I T A !( T J S M .
refer to the indiscriminate anathemas which are hurled
against Roman Catholics unversally, by maintaining
that they are all, priests and people, " hypocrites, idola­
·ters, blasphemers, and impostors,'' whose hearts are full
of guile, and whose hands are swift to shed blood. And
yet this is but a feeble allusion fo the corruption, crime,
and -infamy, which the ultra-protestent press is peren­
nially charging upon all who are within the pale of the
Roman Catholic Church, without any:kind ofdiscrimina­
tion. And let it be observed, that this censoriousness
is not exhibited against the errors, superstitions, frauds,
and mummeries of the system alone, but against every
one ofthose who are deceived thereby.
Whatever may be the iniquities, corruptions, and licen­
tiousness of many of the priests aud nuns, and however
great the enormities which monasteries, convents, and
nunneries, conceal within their cloisters, yet no instances
of detection and exposure, however great and flagrant,
can authorize a gimeral af!d universal imputation of sim­
ilar guilt to all other institutions of the like character.
Especially is this course unjust, when the evidence is
only that furnished by apostates, whose personal cha­
racter is equivocal, and when these witnesses give evi­
dence that they are actuated by vindictiveness and a
spirit of revenge, and when they bring forth no fruits
meet for repentance, not even by that shamefacedness
and- humility which would become them, in the charac­
ter of reformed profligates. And _surely it is inconsis­
tent with the " golden rule " to receive the evid�nce of
recreant nuns and excommunicated priests, in relation
to the character nod conduct oftheir former associates, at
· least until they have acquired a character for themselves,
which would - entitle them to credit, if their' testimony
U L T R A - P R O T E B T A N T I 8 M o 215
were given upon any other subject, and to any other facts.
And we put it to the consciences of those ultra:pro­
testants, who have propagated the " expose of Miss
Reed," the " Awful Disclosures of Maria l\'Ionk," or
the more horril.Jle " N11.rrat ive of Rosamond C ul bertson, '
whether they are will ing that their own cha�cter and
conduct should lie condemned on no betler te�timony ?
How much more cruel is it then that not only 1 he moral
deli nquency of the individu als accused, should be pub­
lished and believed upon no other au thority ; but the
whole fraternity and isterhood to which the accused
party belong, should be placed under the ban of utter
reprobation, and upon no he lter evidence.
uch, however, is the morbid state of feeling which
bas been engendered among protesta nts, by anti-popery
lectu res, nelf'spa pers, pamphlets, and other meMs, that
mulitudes are prepared lo receive any story, however in­
credible in itself, or upon howe"er lender authority, if
it he only sufficiently horrible in guilt and loathsomene s.
And by thtl same means they have be o led lo feel towards
the poor, ignorant, and stupid dupes of the popi h im­
posture, wilhout any kind of di crimination, all that
disgust, contempt, and resentment , which the deeds of
infamy natl blood, attribu ted to certain priests aod ouos,
have irresi til>ly called forth. But we inquire, is thi
candid 1 ls it just 1 is it charitable 1 How different from
the spirit of our Ma ter when surrounded by the igno­
rant dupe of a fa) e religion, hich impelled them to
clamor for hi life, and imbrue their hands in his blood 1
Bear him when he not only prays for their forgiveness,
but describes their true cbaract r - '' they kno10 not what
they do ! ''
Who can doubt that there are many oman priests,
916 U L T R A · l' ll OT B I T A H 'f l l M •
within and without mooaateries, who are iMiaciblg igno­
rant of the delusions of which they are the victims 1 The
same may be said of maoy nuna, who " verily think they
do God servica," aod voluntarily choose the slavery of
the convent, conscieotioualy deceived into the belief that
thus only •hey can escape from the wrath which is to
come. And that great multitudes of the lower classes,
who are bound in the chains of popery, are siocereJy
atriving to serve God and aave their souls, cannot be
questioned. Such priests, nune, and members of the
Roman Catholic Church, as are innocent of the heinous
crimes charged against others, can on no princip]e of
justice or equity be implicated in their guilt, and there
are doubtless' multitude� among them who abhor every
species ofimmorality, and would themselves unite in the
Hposure ofsuch abominations, ifthey could be convinced
of their existence.
Now we design this plea only in behalfofthe innocent ;
and we cannot doubt that there are many such in the
laity, and even among the ecclesiastical orders of that
church ofboth _sexes. By the system in which they have
been educated and trained, and in the bondage of which
they are enslaved, they are kept in ignorance of Bibi�
truth, and all light is excluded, save that which serve.
to perpetnate the errors by which they have been deluded.
For these miserable victims of a corrupt priestcrafl, no
sentiment but of commiseration ought to be felt or ex­
hibited ; nor can we hope to " convert such from ·the
error of their way," while we include them in the cen·
11ures to which, however justly others may be entitled,
they have the consciousnees that so far as they are im­
plicated, those censures are unmerited. And hence,
while we reprobate � errors and crimes ofPopery u a
U L T R A - P R O T E S T A N T I S M . 217
system, and expose its impostures to the public gaze as
duty to the truth dema nds we should, upon Bible prin­
ciples, se11arate men s pe1·son11 from their e1·,.or11, and
prove by the spirit of our efforts, that we love lhe former,
while we abhor the latter. Especially hould we care­
fully d i crirninate between the criminality of the wilful
impostor , and the weakness and ignorance ofthose who
are the mere victims of their delu ·ions. Thus we might
hope to effect the illumiuation and reformation of multi­
tudes on Bible pmc iples, who will otherwi e not only
never be reached, but are ab olutely repelled by ultra ism.
Another and formidable objection to the measures of
tho e who are waging war against Popery in our country,
is found in the demoralizing influence of mos of their
publications. Tales oflust, and blood, nod murder, such
as those with which the ultra-protes.tao t press is teeming,
in all the loathsome and disgusting details in which they
are recited ; and especially when they are represented
as transpiring under the clonk of rel igion, and the crimi­
nals occ upying and disgracing the holy office of the
ministry, are adapted in the very nature of things to
strengthen Che hands of infidelity and irreligion. Nor
can any ''irtuous mind of either sex, fail to contrac t im­
purity by the perusal of ucb publications as those we
havl'I described. Indeed, the multipl icity of such publi­
cations are among the signs of the degeneracy of the
present age ; and posterity it is to be feared, will be the
sufferers for generations to come. And ifthe deplorable
moral influence they are exerting upon the young at
present, were ju tly appreciated, 1111 such books, by
whomsoever publi bed, and by whatever motives they
may have been issued, would be burned by the common
hangman.

IC we might presume 1110 far, we 1fould gladly be in-
1�mental in showing a " more excellent way_
"
te
counteract Romanism aod rescue its deluded vota.riea.
Christianity needs for its propagation no such " carnal
weapon1," but on the contrary disdains them all. Th•
goapol o( Jesua Christ, by its iotriD&ic moral energy, ita
truth, its benevolence, and its power, is omnipotent like
ita Divine Original ; and its success, wherever it is relied
oaa. demonstrates ita adaptation to sweep away every
" refuge of Iie1." Ifa moiety of the zeal and diligence
and liberality which hia1 been wasted by ultra-prote1tanta,
io measures of human device, had been exhibited and
expended in scriptural efforts, on gospel principles, thou­
eaoda, p°erhaps millions, of the Ro!Dan Catholics might
have been enlightened and saved. Instead of which.
there is reason to fear that the controversy thus far bu
been frui�less, ifnot ab.solutely mischievous.. Iu Ireland
:we have an example of what may be done by enlightened
evangelical eff
ort, in the recent success which has at­
tended the simple gospel-method pur�ued wit� the
Roman Catholic population. Pious persons of botli
sexes have employed themselves in visiting the igno�
and depraved vict!-ins · of Popisb superstition at their
houses, and by reading the ScriptW'es, prayer, an<l reli­
gious conversation, they are instrumental not only in
opening their eyes. to the delusions oftheir false religion,
but " brmging th� from the.power of Satlth unto .God."
Thus they are oppoiing the " l\'lan of Sin,'' and making
wv upon " the Beast" with Bible weaponlJ and QU Bible
principles•.
· N_o American, who is under the influence either of
patriotism, pbila,nthropy. or Christianity, can be incjiff
er­
eat to this topic in its various bearings ; and there are
1
1
tr L T R J. • P R O T E 8 'r J. N T Jll M , 219
clMlslderations which seem to indicate �e present to be
the set time f
or the free, folt, and candid discussion of
the whole subject. It is neither possible nor desirable.
that the control'ersy which has existed for so many ages
between Protestants and Papists should cease, nor
that there should be a truce to the war between truth
and error, in this aspect, which is now so vigourously
waging in our own and other countries.
The name of P•oTEsT.lNT originated, and is still re­
tained, for the purj>ose of designating the fact, that the
doctrinal characteristics of Popery and Protestantism
tte, and must be forever irreconcilable. From the day1
of Luther to the present, there lia1 always been felt, lly
every class of Protestants, an unalterable alienatioa·
fl'OID every distinctive peculiarity of Popery, and thla
" attraction of repulsion" is, and ever bas been reciprO­
�l. Heace have arisen the relentless controversies,
which have been carried on at diff
erent periods and ift
various countries, between these belligerent sects, and
the excesses into which both parties have been led, COtl'o
1titute a dark and melancholy chapter in the history oC
the past. And the deeds of cruelty, infamy, and blood,
�1 which the name of God has been diahonoured, aad'
Christianity disgnaced, have been the fruits of the intol­
«ance and persecution which this controversy has en­
gendered, while candour constrains us to acknowledge
that neither Protestants nor Papiets can ever obliterate
&he memory of the guilt in whicla they &ave mutually par­
ticipated.
While, then, the propriety orpersevering opposition to
fopery is admitted, and even maintained, it becomee
tH to profit by the experience ofother aget1 and coun•
trie•• lest proteataoti1m be agaiu dishonoured by par-
HO U L T a A • P a O T • B T .l 1' T l l X.
taking of the intolerant epirit, againet which we are
arrayed. So calamitous have been the re•ults of thia
controversy as written in the history of the past, and so
visibly are they discoverable in the decline of true re­
ligion, and the prevalence of infidelity, that their recol­
lection should serve as a beacon of warning, to the
present and all succeeding generations, against the
revival of a spirit, so fruitful of mischief both to the
church and to the state. For though the position of
these two great armies of Christendom, absolutely f
or­
bids .all �algamation, or even compromise, oeitlrer of
which is desirable, yet each have had sufficient experi­
ence in the use of " carnal weapoos," to teach them the
important lesson that the great Head of the Church will
never approve or prosper such instrumentality. Indeed
the fathers of the American nation, seem to have wisely
appreciated the voice of historic truth, and hence while
they establish no religion, yet as a nation they have
tolerated aU religiona. Liberty of conscience bad then
been too recently purchased, and at the expense of too
much blooc\ and treasure, for them to overlook the
importance oftransmitting it to posterity. And it is the
brightest star in the banner of American freedom, that ·
beneath its ample fold, " every man is permitted to
worship God according to the dictates of his own con­
ecience and under his own vine and fig-tree, none daring
to molest or make hid'i afraid."
· This toleration, which extends to the Roman Catholic
religion, because it is universal, was never designed to
preclude arguments or facts, from being urged in oppo­
•ition to any one form of Christianity, by those whoile
consciences might impel to the employment of such
moral means in religious controversy ; for liberty of
U L T B .&.• P & O T K 8 T A N T l 8 JK . 221
conscience itself, is not more scrupulously guarded, and
MJCured, than a.re the liberty of speech, and the freedom
of the press, by the American constitution. It was,
however, de igned to prevent the employment of any
form of religious per ecution ; so that no citi�en of our
republic should be disf
ranchized of his civil rights, m
suffer either pains, penalties, or forfeiture in bis person,
property, or character, because of his religion. Thus
did the framers of our free government contemplate the
security of equal rights and impartial protection in those
rights, fur every citizen ; and in common with every
other sect, those who profess the Roman Catholic re­
ligion, have the faith of tbe nation pledged for th :ir
safety and toleration .
But although this is o u r glory and boast a s American
citizens and merican Christians, yet recent develope­
ments have clearly indicated, that thu early in our his­
tory there may be danger lest this glory depart from us,
and Ichabod be written even µpon the altars of our free­
dom. For notwithstanding our just and equal laws,
unchanged and unchangeable in tbi respect, continue
to throw their broad shield over all religions, yet we
have seen that even this aff
ords an in uflicienl protec­
tion when our boasted liberty of speech, and liberty of
the pres , degenerate into licentiou ne s. melan�
choly example of this danger is apparent in the present
aspect of the Popi h controversy ; and hould it continue
in the same fierce and denunciatory spirit, and ith
similar measures to those now adopted, feud and bitter
animosities wm be created, and existing prejudice will
be augmented to a dangerous extent. For though the
measures we are deprecating, have not yet provoked any
extensive outbreaking of lawleas violence, yet if the
1 9•
222 V L T S A.• P S O T S B T J. N T U K .
mutual hostility, and repugnance between Catholics and
Protestants shall be perpetually accumulating, the ele­
ments of intemal commotion and civil war are suffi­
ciently rife among us, to endanger the peace of the
nation. And all history fumisbes the admonition, that
an unsanctified zeal for religion, and-the true faith, may
enkindle a fire which many waters will not extinguish ;
and who can tell, but by such means our peaceful and
I
happy countey may not be divided and distracted with
1'&l'8 and rumours of wan, - or what shall prevent our
�ts and fields from being deluged with human blood l
1
That such thoughts are not the Qlorbid imaginings of
an alarmist, nor· the forebodings of pusillanimity, will be 1
apparent, if we glance at the revival of the Popish con-
troversy, with which our whole nation has been recently
agitated. Until within the last seven years, the different
denominations of Protestants in this country, seemed to
hue declared an armistice with the Pope of Rome, for
they forgot their hostility to Romanism, in the conflict of
wordy warf
are which they were infticting upon one
another. But the signs of the times have altered, wi�hin
the brief period we have named, and it is now amazing
to witness with what facili�y those Protestant sects who
differ most widely from each other, will coalesce in
their assault upon the Romish hierarchy, and witli what
fraternal harmony they will unite in prosecuting this
" holy war." Nor is this cessation of hostilities for the
purpose of making battle upon ·� Holy Mother Church"
more remarkable, than is the extraordinary spirit of de-
nunciation with· which Protestants universally become
ilnbued, when they are enlisted in this ·controversy.
lndeed the only criterion of genuine Protestantism for
tllcmselve;s and others, seems to ·be the indiscriminate

•
reprobation of Popery and all- its votaries, whether
priests, n,uns, or laity ; and all who venture to exercise
the judgement of charity, or hazard the expression of a
hope for the sal vation of Papists, even when invincibly
ignorant, are branded as semi-Papi ts, and almo t ex­
commu nicated from the pule of Christendom.
The present revival of this united eff
ort to overlhrow
Popery, is of \'ery recent date. The coutroversy be­
tween th e two reverend gentlemen of Philadelphia, and
a si milar encou nter between another learned clergy man
and the Roman priests of New-York, a few years since,
contributed very m uch to d irec t public attention to the
subject. The lectur s and sermons of a rev. divine of
Baltimore, and another of Philadelphia, served to in­
crease the interest which was every where beginning to
be felt, iind similar means were simultaneously employ­
ed, as if by concert, in various parls of the country, by
clergymen aad laymen of different denominations. But
in all these examples, whether exlen ively useful or not,
neither Cathol ics nor Protesta nts, gave evidence of the
intolerant pirit which has marked sub equent measures.
Indeed those Protestant divines to whom we have
alluded, were labouring strictly within their sacr d func­
tions, in delecling and exposing the error and i mpos­
tures of Popery, a nd the zeal, abil ity, and learning they
brought to the subject, merit the warm commenda tion of
the Protestant world. Nor did ei ther of them, o far as
we know, espose himself, or the holy cause of Protes­
tant Christianity to just reproach.
Meanwhi le, however, a Protestant clergyman, who
had witne sed the corruptions of the Roman priesthood
in Canad , durioa a residence there, remo ed to New­
York. His soul had been grieved with the abomina-
12-i U J. T a A • P a O T S 8 T A R T l 8 Xo
tiollll ofPopery, u he bad diacovered themin the Britiala
province., and he was filled with indignation against
Bomaoism, under the infiuence of which he pro
jected a
MriH of publicatioos, periodical aod otherwise, all of
which were designed to enlighten public sentiment m
the United States, in relation to the evils of the Roman
Catholic church, and to stimulate Protestants to unite in
measures for the overthrow ofthe Pope of Rome, in the
eftOrts he and his minioDB are making to gain the con­
trol of public sentiment in this free and happy land.
Without impugning the motives, or questioning the
benevolence of this reverend gentleman, whose age and
claaracter entitlo him to respect, it will not be deemed
either disrespectful or uncharitable, to express the opin­
ion, that he baa betrayed a spirit, and exhibited a temper,
upon this subject, which disqualifies him for the high
poeition he occupie• in this field of cootrover11y. From
the beginning, hi• writings ban had the 8emblance of
vindictiveness, perha119 owing to hill actual contact with
:Popery, during his residence in Canada. But from
whatever cause this unhappy censoriousness has arisen,
which is obvious in all his writings, it is f
atal to his use­
fulness as a polemic. Indeed such appears to be the
violence ofhis indignation against Romanism, as a sys­
tem, that he cannot restrain it from bursting forth in
•trains of invective which too much resemble the anathe­
ma.I of Popish ink>lerance itself. And hill wrath ia
kindled not merely when he names the Pope, the
Jesuits, the priests, the ouna, and the deluded dupes of \
the Romish imposture, but he e:&hibits little less charity
for those Protestantlt who will not unite with him in hill
iJMliscriminate reprobation; ,
Among the potent publicatiou of the times, on thia
U L 'l: R A - P R O T B S T J. N T J 8 M. 225
subject, we may also name the able letters of " Brutus,"
which have acquired extensive popularity ; and that they
have contributed to awaken suspicion and engender evil
forebodings of the mischiefs to the church and state,
which the increase of Popery threatens, cannot ·be
doubted. Whether their eff
ect hns been salutary, or
contributed in any way to the suppression of Roman
Catholic influence in the country, is problematical ; for
while many have been fully pers1Jaded of the existence
ofthe foreign conspiracy and unholy alliance against the
liberties of America; which " Brutus" so eloquently
describes, yet there are very many who look upon bis
suspi'cions and accusations, as the fruit of his own mor­
bid imaginings, and sympathize with those whom they
regard as the victims of unrighteous persecution.
But all such publications as those we have named,
even including the indiscriminate censoriousness of the
Anti-Popery periodicals, however censurable in their
spirit, and exceptionable in their tendency, are compa­
ratively innocent, when contrasted with the more recent
measures employed in this controversy. Indeed ·the
class of Anti-Popery literature, including volumes, pam­
phlets, tracts, and newspapers, have become so numer­
ous, that it is impossible to read them all, unless indeed
all other reading be postponed to the all-absorbing in­
quiry into the abominations of Romanism. Those who
f
eel it their special duty to keep pace with the contro­
versial theology and literature of the times, have found
it no small tax upon their time even to glance at all the
works which are perennially deluging the nation.
Without aUempting to enumerate a moiety of such
iasues from the Protestant press, we must content our­
aelves with a reference to a single species ofthe genus,
lff 17 L T R ..l • P B. O T ll l T ..l l( T l l M: .
and one against which it becomes our eolemn duty, in
tbe name of Prosteetantism and Christianity, to record
our protest. · We allude to the class of volumes wbieh
have successively appeared in relation to nuN and fitm­
,.,,;u, until the public appetite for scandal, and licea­
tiousness, has been indulged to surf
eiting ; and it may
well be feared that the holy office of the Christian min­
istry has been identified in the public mind, with the
real or fictitious tales ofcrime and blood, which are re­
lated of some of its unworthy members. That some of
these publications are demoralizing in their nature, and
tend to pollute the imaginations and hearts of the unso­
phisticated, and the virtuous, cannot be questioned ; nor
can any benevolence of motive in their authors, com­
pensate for the deplorable mischiefs inflicted up� the
public mon.ls.
Suppose that nunneries and con't'ents uni'f'ersally, are
truly represented to be priestly seraglios : Let it be ad­
mitted, that licentiousness, inf
anticide, and murders
most foul and unnatural, are daily and nightly perpetra-.
tecl, by the male and female ecclesiastics, who inhabit
these dens of pollution. Let the cowl of the monk, and
· the
'
veil ofthe nun, be known as but the mask by whicb
the most horrid deformities in morals, are concealed.
Nay, let it be conceded, that these secret cloisters are the
chosen resort for the most disgusting, lewd, and awful
crimes, which ever disgraced humanity and insulted
Heaven : And although it is impossible for fanaticism
itself to believe all this, yet little short o( all this is al­
leged. But even . on the absurd presumption Yiat such
are the horrible facbl in the case, we put it to the hearts
and consciences of parents in this Christian nation, &ball
our IODS and daughters be introduced to f

Shall we conduct them to the purlieus of perdit ion, and
uncover these pits ofmoriU putref
action 1 Or can we in­
nocently furnish them with books, in which they are in­
doctrinated by real or pretended nuns, into all the me­
retricious art and diabolical snare , by which their mind
were first poisoned, their hearts.. polluted, and their vir­
tue and character sacrificed on the altar of sacr dotnl
wickednes11 1 Shall we then say to our sons and daugh­
ters, " these walled convents are the pretended abodes
ofpiety nod religion , - these prie ts are the minist rs of
the sanctuary, who profess to be • the vi ible agents of
the invisible God,' - and these nun are those who, for
religion's ake, olemnly renounce the world and its
charms, choosing the vow of eternal celibacy, and the
grated prison of the convent or nunnery, under the hypo­
critico.l pretext of elf-denial and sanctity, though all ara
thu steeped to the very lip in pollution and blood 1 "
If uch !es oos b e taught under any pretence, and if
such books be promiscuou ly distributed 11mong children
and youth of both sexes, in any community under heaven
we cannot hesitate to affirm that the eff
ects of such te­
merity will be witnessed, not me rely in the polluting in­
fluence ofthe loathsome delaiJ of crime, such a in the
judgement of an apo tie, " it is a shame even to name "
among u ; but the promotion of infidelity and irr ligion
will be the inevitable results. The disgu t intended to
be created again t the religion of the Roman atbolicli,
by showing that this is the cloak which cover deed
of horror, " enough to make the cheek of dillkness
pale," may engender ho tility which will be ea ily trans­
ferred lo all religion ; for su picions once taking po see-
1es ion of the carnal mind, in relation to any clas11 f
228 U L T R A. • P R O T E S T .l l'l' T JIJ H .
religionists, and especially any order of ministers, are ex­
ceedingly liable to be indulged against Christianity it- .
self. For if the pretensions to sanctity by which priests
and nuns impose upon the world, are only the disguise
which covers such enormities, the inference is, alas ! too
easy under such cireumstaoces, that all similar ap­
pearances of sanctity are equally hypocritical and vile.
Hence the moral obliquities of professed Christians, and
especially the grievous derelictions of those who have
assu01ed the holy office of the ministry, are universally
seized upon by the enemies of all religion ; and to ex­
pose them to tht1 public gaze, by Whatever motive we
are actuated, is an act which wounds, not merely the de­
nomination immediately disgraced, but the character of
Christianity itself. Much more to be deprecated, is the
accusation of heinous crime, when made by one Class of
religionists against another, upon equivocal or insuffi­
cient testimony ; for when the injustice of such an as­
sault is exposed, it inf
allibly recoils upon the heads ofits
authors. And on the presumption that Popery is to- be
overthrown by exposing its abominations, the greatest
caution is necessary in regard to the accuracy of the al­
legations made, for another important reason, since when
once our veracity is rendered questionable in any given
case, we cannot hope to be successful in gaining public
confidence, even when we speak the truth.
Having thus frankly expressed our views, in relation
to the present publications of this Anti-Popery crusade, .
we propose to conclude this paper, by suggesting fur the
consideration of wiser and better men, a " more excel­
lent way," to inculcate the truth of Protestantism and
overthrow the errors and corruptions of Popery. And
we do so with more confidence, since we suppose that
U L T R A - P R O T E S T A N T I S M • 229
it is ru>w demonstrably proved, that the present leaders
in this controversy ·are not the men, nor theirs. the in­
strumentalities, which are adapted to the work.
The errors and corruptions of Romanism, however
great and flagrant, are not more formidable antagonists,
than the false religions againsl which hristianity bad to
contend, upon its first introduction by Christ and bis
apostles. And yet they did not fonn Anti-Judaism, or
Anti-Gentileism, nor yet anti-sin societies, but acted
upon the principle th at truth was omnipotent against
error, and therefore " pr ached Jesus and the resurrec­
tion," as the al l-suffic ient moral engine for the con ver-
ion of the world. We find them, it i true, bearing tes­
timony against fal'e teachers and fal-e doctrine, but
they employed no other weapon again l error, thao the
propagation of its opposita truth. Their example and
their success are recorded for ou r inst rnction and imita­

In order to show tbnt Ihere is ample employment for
Protestant d ivi ne , and Christia n!", in counteracting Pa­
pery, and la bouring to con vert Roma n atholic from
tho error of thei r ways, which is their para mount duty,
we need only point lo a few of the prominent errors of
that y tern, which are radical 1 md fu ndamental. A gai nst

ud "8Jielding oppodioo. All an eminent example oC
this temper and spirit in thd very controveny, we wouJd
refer the reader to the " Thoughts oa Popery," by the
Bev. Wm. NeviDll of Baltimore, a yoJume which, if the
Roman Catholicl collld be persuaded and permitted to
read, would do more to enlighten and Hve them, than
will be effected by anti-popery efforts aucb as we are
cleploring, though they be protracted for a century.
Thefir1tcapital crime of Popery, and one of which it
cao be readily convicted, by the teatimony of their
highest ecclesiastical authority, is that ofprohibiting the
circulation of " the Holy Bible without note or com­
ment." Tpe fact that they do this is of itself an evi­
dence oftheir being enemies to the " truth of God ; " -
apd their plea ofjustification that the Revelation which
Divine wisdom has bestowed, is insufficient Bii a rule of
faith and practice, without the �uperadded perversiona
of the Fathers, and the interpretation of the priesthood,
while it sustains the truth of the allegation, is itself con­
clusive proof, that they are rejecters of Christ, and con-
temners of His authority.
'
Another of the devices of Satan of which Popery i1
cuilty, is the claim to Infallibility, whether it be predi·
oated of the Pope, or ofthe Pope and Cardinals, or of
a council of Holy Fathers,. or of the Church ; and in
either case, it is only a different modification of the
" refuge oflies." In exposing this false dogma, es well
as the ludicrous pretences by which they attempt to sup­
port it, we will find a potent weapon of assault upon the
eystem and its votaries.
But it were needless to dwell upon the multiplied alle­
&•tions of false doctrine which may be proven against
" the �allible church." lt will be sufficient for our pur-
U L T B A • P B. O T B S T A. l'I T I !I M . 231
p0119 to enumerate a f
ew of the most prominent. We
repeat it, then, that Popery may not only be accused, but
convicted in the f
ace ofheaven and e1lrtb of the follow­
ing, among other crimes, viz : l st, The most heinous
andflagrnnt idolo.t1·y ;-2d, The rejeclimi,prohibilion, and
alteration oflhe Holy Scriptures ; - 3d, The assumption
of the authority and power to forgive sin_, out of which
has grown the stupendous frauds and impost ures of
atiricula1· confe1sio1l, absolution and indt1lgences ; -4th,
The unscri ptural and absurd doctrine of Purgatory, by
which craft the priesthood have their gains, and out of
which dogma, fabricated for the purpose, their millions of
infatuated victims are robbed of their hard earnings
while living, and their property when dead. 5th, Their
syEttem of penances, which they have impiously invented
and decre..id in lie u of that evangelical repentance,
which the gospel of God commands . 6th, Their vows
of celibacy fo.r male and female ecclesiastics, " forbid�
ding to marry," which in the Scriptures is declared to
be a " doctrine of dev ils," and from which there ie
reason to apprehend the mo t shameful licentiousness
and hypocri y. 7lh, The intolerance of their anathemas
against all tho e who refu e to acknowledge their spiri�
ual supremacy, by denouncing them as heretics ; 11J1d
dooming all to perdition, of which they claim to have
the keys, who die without the pale of Holy Mother
Church. And lastly, their doctrine of the mass, their
prayers to saint , their blasphemies in canonizing Mary
the mother of God, their horrible heresy of transubstan­
tiation, their image- worship, their holy water, their
sacrifices for the dead, their my ticism, their holy
unction, their relics, their miracle working, and the
numberless mummeries of which unimpeachable history
182 U L T R .l• P S O T l: ll T .l tl T U W.
bu coovicted them, may be added to the catalogues of
corruptions and el'!ors of which the Roman Catholic
cpurch stand coodemned, by testimony which can neither
be refuted nor gainsayed.
Such is Popery, the grand enemy of the truth of God,
and the happiness of man. And shall Protestants pro­
claim their need for any 11pecific instances of individual
delinquency or crime, to convict such a system ofrotten­
ness? Are we to make war upon a single nunnery,
because licentiousness and murder may have been there
the fruits of the vows ofcelibacy, - when we eao show
that those vows are themselves in violation of the laws
of nature and in contravention of the laws of God1
Shall we be taught to lay aside the Bible, the " word of
God," the " sword of the Spirit," - and instead of this
mighty weapon, shall we take in our right hand, the
" Awful Disclosures of Maria Mook," wherewith to
" make war upon the beast 1" Is tbe gospel insufficieat,
almighty though it is, to pull down this strong bold of
Satan 1 Or do we despair of the cause of Protestant­
ism, when assailed by the idolatry, arrogance, blasphemy,
f
alsehood, hypocrisy, and imposture, which Popery em­
ploys, because in addition to 1' the whole armour of God,"
we have not the " Protestant Vindicator," the Down­
fall of Babylon," Roaanwnd Culberuon," or the " au­
thentic edition ofMaria Monk '!'' Alas ! if the friends
of truth and Protestantism, are in need ofsuch weapons,
i.t would indicate that they shrink from the combat with
" Anti · Christ personified," and are already quailing be­
f
ore the " hosts of the. Philistines."
It has always been to us matter of amazement, how
any Protestant Christian, can for a moment have his
equanimity disturbed, by apprehensions of the ultiuiate
U L T R A • P R O T B II T .&. N T I S M . 233
triumphs ofJ;>opery. It betrays in our estimation, either
the most deplorable ignorance of the corruptions of the
system of Romanism, or what is little less to be lamen­
ted, the most feeble faith aod imperfect knowledge of
the resources and instrumentalities of Christianity. Po.
pery as a syste m of re l igion has in it the seeds of its own
dissolution, in the stupendous falsehoods on which it is
erected. The infall ible testimony of inspiration has
prophetically
-
written its character, its history, and its
doom, and the overthrow of the Pope and his myrmidons,
is n · certain and will be as entire, as the foretold and
fulfilled destruct ion ofJeru alem. No Protestant Chris­
tian with the Bible in his haml, need falter in bis faith,
especially 1 hen the signs of the times are so ominous of
victory to the cause of truth.
But w·e are free to declare, that if Protestant Chris­
tianity, founded as it is u pon the Rock of Ages, and
sustained by the Divine benediction and the Divine
promises, can be defeated by a sy tem of intellectual
imbecility and moral deformity, such as we have seen
Popery to be, then is it not worth preserving. If Roma n­
i m can drive the ploughshare of min through the faiE
fields of virtue and religion, which Protestantism has
planted and cultivated in this and other lands ; then will
be exhibited, what the history gf the church aod 1he
world has never recorded, and what was never witnessed
either by ea,rth or heaven. Our venerable maxil)l that
" truth is mighty and wilJ prevail," must be reversed,
when error, foul and u n natural, as ever polluted the
mind and heart of man, can supplant the Divinely im­
parted evidence, which accompanies the truth of God.
Need we to ho reminded that " God governs the world,"
and that the " gates of hell " can never prevail against
20*'
234 U L T R A - P R O T E 8 T A 1" T U X .
the church of Christ, though all its floods were let loose
in one fiery deluge t
, The facts that Protestants, whose faith is firmly es­
tablished as the pillal'll of Heaven, should unwisely re­
sort to such contemptible skirmishing in a c.ontest with
Popery, argues the weakness of their cause, if it did
not obviously arise from perverted views of policy and
duty. We have enough of arguments drawn from
reason and revelation to do battle against Romaoism,
without stopping to inquire into the chastity of priests,
the virtue ofnuns, or the morals of coove11ts. " We are
doing a great work and· cannot come down" should be
.
.
the only
'
answer of Protestants to aoy of the artifices of
the Papacy to draw us into controversy on subjects of
debateable character, and in relation to which the onua
probandi is adroitly thrown upon us. We care not if
all the nunneries iu the land are the very personification
of the " holy of holies" so far as the inorals of the in­
mates are concerned ; nor does it at all concern us, if
all the priests and nuns ara immaculate. Still, even ad­
mitting all this, which is by no means true, .nevertheless
we are prepared to show, that the whole fabric ofPopery
is founded in imposture. I.et it not be imagined then
for a moment, that for the refutation of Romani$m, we
need to be put to tpe proofof the crimes of the " ghostly
fathers," or " holy sisters," who inhabit the Hotel Dieu.
And yet we are pained to confess that such i» the false
position in which the present aspect .of the controversy
has placed the great and glorious cause of Protestantism,
which these ultras and fanatic11 seem to have taken
under their exclusive protection.
It is enough to accuse. Popery of what no. man dare
deny, nor need we urge a single charge again�t tbat co..
•
U L T R A • P R 0 T E B T J.. N T 1 S M , 23 5
lossal monument of crime, which any of its votaries
would have the etrrontery lo gai nsay. The single fact
that the celibacy oflhe p1·ie.9ls is taught, and enforced, is
a dam ning proof of their rebel l ion against the R utho rily
of Gotl, and this alone demonstrates that the system is
thut of " A nti-Christ. " That the n ons are requ ired to
take the vows of perpetual virginity, is anothe r and simi·
Jar transgression of tbe laws of nature and of God ; and
neither of these alleg&tioos again t R omanism can be
ga insayed , for both are avo wed, and vindicated as in tri n­
sic features of the sy tern. Now, with only the Bible io
our hands, we may go forth against this single abomina­
tion, and having promo the doctrine of " forbiddi ng to
marry " to be the " doctrine of devils," on the authority
of inspiration, it would b easy to prove by the a me
testimony, that so far from such vow of ccl ibccy being
binding in tbe ight of God, e ither upon priests or nuns,
that if they rigidly observe it to the end of their lives,
they are by that act guilty of grievou tran gression and
" mortal sin." For it is true in the morals of the Bible
that " a bad promise is better broken than kept," for
the sin is not in breaking a bnd promise ; but in having
111ade it ; a nd in breaking i t alone, ca n we bring forth
" fruits meet for repentance. " Hence the immediate
lawful marriage of all the priests and n uns, notw ith­
standing their sacerdotal vow, and all the solemn sanc­
tions with which it was imposed, is the dictate ofpolicy
and duty, the uggestion both of reason and rel igion.
To illustrate thi;i position, suppose a combina tion of
Atheists, the di ciples of Fanny Wright, were to impose
upon their male and femalo votw·ies, a solem n vow, with
all the sa nctions of an extra-judicial oath, that they
would cost their children as soon as born upon the
Ill 17 L T & .l • P R O T S S T .l ll 'l' U •·
llate, and abuclon them to the care ofthe C91D1Duoity,
ecc:ording to the creed and morala of that peripatetic
pbil090pber. Now auppo119 the attempt to perform
.... YOW by ffery mother, WU resisted by the deep
Yoiee of nature, and the maternal heart, instinctively re­
Yolted against this unnatural deed. Who would not
here recogniae the truth, that parnlal aff
ect�n is im­
planted by the Creator in the fundamental laws of the
physical and intellectual being. And yet the co11jwgal,
u well .. the maternal relation, are both ordained oC
God, and that system of religion which interferes witb
either, is ipao faclo f
alse.
But we forbear to pul'llUe thia subject, although the
moet prominent characteristics ofRomanism are . equal·
Jy vulnerable to the assaults of the Bible and common
811118e." Hence we deprecate the present aspect of the
controveray, because the strong and impregnable for­
treues of truth are abandoned by the Protestant army,
and a kind ofrunning-fight is kept up, not against Popery,
but agaiost Father Phelan, and the Hotel Dieu. While
at the same time the " mighty weapons" furnished by
t1ae armoury of Heuen are suffered to rust ; Bible trut1I,
and Bible arguments, are lai.e aside ; and instead of
preaching " Christ crucified," Protestant ministers and
Christians are employed in crying through the land,
the precious name of.Maria .MonkI Shame on such
Protestants,-they dishonour the cause of truth, and e11-
sentially subserve the cause ofPopery ; and what is still
worse, they betray the ark of the Lord, and the cause of
Christianity itself into the bands of its enemies. Nay
more, they basely pander· to the depraved, appetite for ·
1Candal, which is increased and perpetuated by '4 what
it feeda on."
U L T R A. - P B. 0 T I: 8 T A N T 1 8 H . 237
Finally, if there were ao other objection to the cha­
racter of the present war waging against Romanism, an
all-sufficient one is found in the indiacriminate manner
in which Papists are denounced, as though it were im­
possible for any man to be saved, within the pale ofthat
church, however he may be blinded by ignorance, bound
by prejud
.ice, or enslaved by superstition and priestcraft.
Such intolerance, is neither consistent with Protestant­
ism nor Christianity, for the creed of both concedes that
in eyery nation and in every church, " he that feareth
God and worketb righteousness is accepted of Hiin."
We cannot envy either ihe candour, or the charity of
that man who does not believe that there have been,
IUld are now such, who wear the chains of the Papacy,
and are nevertheless " accepted of God," who judgeth
righteously, " according to that which a man hath, and
not according to that which he hath not." That there
have been eminent!y holy men, who have lived and died in
the Roman Catholic Church, cannot be questioned with­
out denying the unimpeachable evidences which history
has recorded. Some of their names are rendered im·
perishable by their deeds of piety and lives- of useful­
ness ; nor is it manly pr hoµest to withhold or conceal
this concession, which truth .and candour demand. They
lived and died nevertheless in grievous error, and were
themselves the dupes of imposture, but of their salvation
we have no authority to doubt, ifthey " feared God and
worked righteousne� ; " and of this, in the case of many,
we have strong evidence.
The like want o
f discrimination is perceptible in re­
probating all the doctrines of Romanism, for many of
these as taught in their standard. writings; will be found
to be, on important and cardinal poin.ts, strictly orthodox
118 U L T Jl .l. • P R O T S I T .1. IC T lll Jll .
and aeriptural. The doctrine of the Holy Trinity, the
unity of the Godhead, the essential Divinity of Christ,
and the Deity ofthe Holy Ghost, will allbe found in the
creed of Romanism.
But while all these great and essential troths are
maintained and defended, and common justice demands
that all this should be frankly-admitted, yet these sound
and wholesomfl truths are corrupted, aad most ioco�t­
ently mingled with error, mysticism, and imposture, by
which their glory is obscured, and their practical influ­
ence for the most part annihilated. Nay more, the troth
of God, is adulterated by additions and emendations, by
the Roman Catholic Church, until the simplicity, purity
and spirituality of Christianity is lost, amidst a multitude
of unauthorized dogmas, ceremonies, and unmeaning ·
mummeries. While Popery prof
esses to hold the true
. doctrines of the gospel, many of which are not only
stated, but ably defended, by her standard writers, yet
her guilt consists in the f
act, that she " bolds the truth
inunrighteousness," as she not ooly teaches the truth, but
a vast amount IJIOre than the truth I And what does it
avail her, supposing she held every doctrine of Christi­
anity, while at the same time she " teaches for doctrine
the commandments of men," by which the fornier are
oullifieiJ. So far from the truths she holds being urged in
her vindication under such circumstances, her orthodoxy
in these respects only increases her power of mischief,
and renders her a ml'.)re dangerous and formidable foe to
Christianity. This semblance of the true faith, which
her " articles of religion " exhibit, while. united to other
articles which are utterly at variance with the former, is
the secret of her power and influence, sine& it serves..to
clothe error in the habiliments oftruth. .A nd in the Op-
U L T R .f. ., P R O T & I T .l N T J 8 M , 239
position to Romanistn, to which Protestants by their
duty to the cause oftruth are imperiously bound, it is of
vast importance that they should make a just discrimi·
nation in their censures, " sepatating between the pre­
cious and the vile," both in relation to the doctrines of
Popery, as well as towards the <.!el uded vic t ims of her
impostures.
Let us never forget that the cause of Protestantism
and of Christianity are identi�al, and that the successes
of the former are but the victories of the latter. And
surely if we form this estimate of the nature of our po­
sition, we may banish all those morbid fears, which
craven spirits are wont to ind u lge, in relation to the js.
111ue of our contest with Pape ry. O u rs is a " troug
tower," a " kingdom which tile God of heaven has set
up," and which " shall never be moved.1' The " Church
ofChrist " ha " her found ation in the holy mountains."
Ours is a strong city with " a wall of fi re round about,
and the glory in the mid t."
As o u r cause is thus secure, and our ultimate triumph
certain, let Chri tian ministers beware le l they delay
the period of our victory, by expending their strength for
nought, or at least waste their energie upon warring
upon the mere borders of the enemy's ca m p. Especially
should such take heed, le t the employment of any
specie of " carnal wellpoos,
"
hould expose us to the
curse inflicted upon those who brought " strange fire to
the altar of God," or " touched the ark with unhallowed
hands."
Popery is to be attacked, not in her out-works, but in
her strong-holds ; and wi_th the " mighty weapons " ofthe
gospel of God, we may at once make the &Bsault upon
the heart of her encampment. And to do th.is effee·
240 0 L T R A • P R O T K 8 T A JI T U K.
tually, let the Bibi• Society make the charge, and into
the band of every Roman Catholic upoa the earth, who
can read its sacred pages, let a copy of tJlis " sword of
the spirit" be placed ; and let those who cannot read
have its lessons of heavenly wisdom repeated in their
ean, by those 11·hom the " lo't'e of Christ con8trains 77
to f
eel for the souls oftheir f
ellow-pien. Let Prolulmat
Sabbuth-&hoola gather the children of the poor into
those nurseries ofthe church, and by kindness and Jove
their ears and their hearts may lie opened to " the truth
as it is in Jeaus." Let missionaries of the cross be
multiplied and sent forth until their numbers shall ex­
ceed the whole army of Je11uits, monks, friars, and
nuns, whom Pope Gregory employs throughout his vast
domains. And Jet the whole Christian Church come up
to the work of evangelizing the world ; nnd by their
prayer�, exertions, and liberality, let them prove that
their zeal for the truth is equal to that of Romanists far
their sect. Then within the walls of the eter�al city,
other Pauls shall " proclaim the unse.archable riches of
Christ," and a " nation shalr be born in a day." Then
will it soon be heard, even from the strong-Mids of Ro­
manism, that our Messiah is " bringing his sons from
af
ar, and his daughters from the ends of the earth."
.. Then will Protestant Christianity raise her song of ti;.
umphant victory, while the thunders of the Vatican will
• be silenced amidst the echo of the cry which shall go
up into the heavens, from every nstion, kindred, tongue,
and people, Hallelujah, the Lord God omnipotent reign­
eth I
In concluding this chapter, which is already too Jong,
we would now briefly remark that the enormous evil•
of Intemperance, Slavery, and Popery, will never be
1
'U L T. R A • P R O T E 8 T A N T U M . 241
overthrown by any system of ultraism or humbug. So
far from this result, experience and observation must
convince the candid and discerning, that uch principles
and measures lls we have been deprecating, are aug­
menting the evils which they are intended to remove.
The reason is obviously this : when we go btt
Jond th&
Bible, we exclnde ourstilves from the Divine promise
and benediction, and take protection in our own devicee.
It is written " Cur ed is he t hat maketh flesh his arm.''
So long as we substitute any human invention or contri­
vance for the Divi nely appointed instrumentality, in auy
of the enterprises of benevolence, we dishonour God,
and need not hope to prosper. " 'l'be race is not to the
swift, nor the battle t the strong." " Not by might, nor
by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord." " For the
weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty
through God to the pulling down of trong-bolds."
For the sake of lhe holy c a u e of Temperance, then,
identified a_g i>i that cau e with the highest in terests and
dearest hopes of our whole specie , we should beware
of every · form of ultroism, either in our principle or
measure ; and we may preserve ourselves and others
from so flagrant error, by inculcating " total ab lineace
from all intoxicati ng liquors, as a beverage," wholly on
the grouud of expediency, since thi doctrine, as we
have seen, is in strict conformity withi the Bible. In
like manner, if 'Ye abhor Slavery and benevolently de­
sire its abolition, let us take he d that we adopt no
maxim which goes be1
Jond the Bible, nor pur ue any
melll!o res which that infallible standard doe not author­
ize ; sine , by such ultta isru, we forfeit all claim to the
protection and guidance of the God of the Bible, and
" without H1M we can do nothing.'' So also in a.ny
2 1
2'2 . 17 L T & A • P R O T S I T A 1' T l 8 M .
eft'ort we put f
orth (
or the overthrolf. of Popwy ; if we
would succeed in thia benevolent enterprise, we must
" 1et our faces u a flint" against all " bitterness and
wrath, and evil speaking, and all uncharitableness," and
1erupulouly adhere to the infallible standard, in all the
meaias we employ, lest " our good be evil spoken of
."
· Thus, and thWJ only, can any Christian enterprise se­
cure the Divine approbation, for God has never pros­
pered any cause. which either in its principles or. meas­
ures, goes beyand tbe Bible ; and it ia pure f'anaticism,
therefore, to expect to prosper while justly chargeable
with ultraism. However intrinsically good the cause
in which we labo\lr, however pure the motives by which
we are actuated, and however sincerely aod devoutly
we may pray for the Divine blessing, nevertheless, if
in our spirit we are destitute of " that wisdom which is
from above," and in our measures we violate the " law
oflove," and hence go beyond the Bible, we thus merit
the name of ultras, and vitiate all that we do. Nay
more, by touching even the ark of the Lord " with u.a­
hallowed hands," our ultraism may betray it into the
hands of our enemies. And as the true friends oftem­
perance, emancipation, and protestantism, we deprecate
ultraism, when arrayed under our
'
1>anne�, as a more
(ormidable foe to our success than all the phalanx of our
enemies, however numerous or powerfuI their opposition.
And so important and essential do we regard it to the
1pread of right principles, and the prosperity of truth in
every aspect, that ultraism should be excommunicated
from our ranks, that we hesitate not to maintain, if
r.,monstrance and expostulation with such fanatics be
vain, all amalgamation with them should be renounced.
Thoae wbo occupy Bible ground, shoul� formally and
U L T R A - P R 0 T It 9 T A N T l S M . 243
utterly repud iate all corrnexion with those ultraists, and
no longer allo w the cause of truth and benevolence to
b e hindered or jeoparded by misguitled friends. Let
the line of demarcation be dra wn, and thus ultraism ,
standing alone, would appear i n its naked deformity, and
be no longer concealed by wearing the li very of truth,
ant.I being identi fied with the cause lo which it cla i ms
adhesion, while it only hazards, injures, and destroys.
Thu may Tempera nce, A bolit ion, and Protestantism, be
prolecterl from the withering curse which ultraism and
hu mbug never fail to inflict.

acterised, llre in any wise to be the subject of animad­

they may be with propriety called sects, and their pecu­

are exclusive ; yet such _sectarianism cannot be con­
demned, so long .as in advancing -their denomin11tional
rights, they refrain from trespassing 11pon the rights of
others. The odiou1mess which the term Sectarianism
baa acquired l!y its opprobrious misapplication, is one
U L T R .A. • B K C T .A. R I .A. K I B JI[, 246
of which the public mind will never be disabused, until
greater candour is exhibited on the part of the various
Christian and Protestant 1ects. Each ofthem is unde·
viatingly labouring to build up a particular sec� and
thus far they are all sectarian ; but, with the restriction
before mentioned, such Sectariani m is commendable,
and should never be disavowed by any.
But ultra-Sectm-ianiam we have chosen lo denomi­
nate a hu mbug ; and by th.is phrase ul tra, we meB.D, as in
the former cases, that Sectariaui m, which transcends
or goe11 beyond the limits which the Bible, our infallible
standard, prescribes, in its effort to promote denomina­
tional or party interests. And whether such ultraism
exists elsewhere than in imagination, will presently
appear. That example abound in the land, however,
would fumi h no justification of introducing this chapter
here, if this were not strictly among the humbugs of this
great c ity.
And first, because of it.s obvious prevalence, the ultra­
Sectariani m among us is seen in the bitterness and
censoriousness, with which ome religion· t anathema­
tize all other sects but their own. A memorable in­
stance bas already been enlarg d upon in the preceding
chapter on Popery and anti-Popery, under the titJ of
ullra-Protestanti m, as well as the aect to which we
have affi.."t.ed the style ultra-Abolitionism. But equally
glaring exhibition ofintolerance are unhappily witnessed
among the variety of sect into which Protestant Chris·
tendom is divid d. A learned divine of one sect, pub­
lishes a volume de igned to show that the iam of another
sect " is not 'hristianity," excommunicating from the
visible church o hrist on earth the multitudes around

aoathemati&es. and by thia act, not merely arroga&iog
the keys oC Peter, but " exalting bimaelf aboye God."
.Another adopts and propagates the opinion, tliat there
ia " no oilier true church on earth," but that sect wbieh
claima bia name amoog its membership ; that there
are " no true ministera ofChrist,'' but thOlle who ofticiate
a.t hia altars, and upon whose heada the same hands have
been laid, or / those similarly conaecrated . in fanciful
aucceuion from remote antiquity, if not from the· Apoa­
tlu themselves. A third, reprobates a learned ministry,
condemns all study as a prepsratioD for pulpit efforts,
md denounces llerary and theological knowledge, as
though ignorance were indispenBBble to piety or useful­
--. While a fourth, uncbrilltiaoa all whose baptism
baa not been administered by immersion, and by a min­
iater who hail himself been immersed in a similar way,
an4 will not unite in the ordinances of Christianity with
any but such, whatever evidence they may possess and
uhibit of 1piritual regeneration, " the thing signified,''
b1 the rite of baptism. And still another disdaims all
fellowship with a " hireling miniatry," as be denominates
all such u " live of the goapel," and denounces as un­
christian all the forms and ceremonies which diatinguish
other sects, claiming for bis own sel't absolute and
immediate, and exch1sive inspiration, from the Almighty.
These and all similar manif
estations of intolerance
by individuals and denominations, are styled in our
philosophy, ultra-Sectarianism, wherever and whenever
&hey are appartmt. For however learned and logical
- may be the sophisms, by which such claims of iofalli­
'bility are arrogated and defended, the pretence to exclu­
sive truth and Christianity by whomsoever set up, if
accompanied by cenaoriousneas and denunciation upon

others, is in the light of reason and religion, a flagrant
imposture, and therefore merits the significant title of
humbug. Its victims may be "' innocent of the great
transgression, ' because of c irc u mstances known and
apprecia ted by the Searcher of hearts, but this does not
Jessen the mischiefs of the i mposture upon others, no.r
does it diminish th� nece sity of exposing and correcting
the bum bug itself, - h owever it may exculpate its dupes
from guilt in the premises.
But a still m o re extraord inary example of this same
ullm-seclal'ianism, is vi ible in t he prolific race of
" here:ty-hunte1·s,'' which ome of the sects have been
multi plying in their own bo om within a few years.
There arc " giants in these days " in this d partmenl ;
men who esteem themselves e t in Zion for the purpose
of guarding with lynx-eyed vigilance against heresy in
their partic u lnr denomi nation. So that sects are not
only arrayed against other sects, but m inisters of the
s a m e sect profess out of pure •1 godly jealous ," to
watch one 1rnother, uud this they do through " green "
spectacle , for the purpose of d iscovering in their ser­
mons, peeche , pamphlets, or book , any spice of hete­
rodoxy in matter or manner. And if " one of their
brethren eTr from the truth," or what s e e m s worse, ex­
press his idea in any other tha n the istereoty ped phrases
of the Confession of Faith or the expo itions ofthis creed
by the old masters in chola tic divinity ; if an effort is
made to " re tore him," it must be done not " in the
spirit of meekne s," but 1' in the spirit of ecclesiastical
juri prudence. It is true, it is done with the ulmosl
artngfi·oid, the proces es are in tituted in Pre byteries,

tion of zeal for the boooor of the sect, as though the
phraseology of ita creed w�re truth personified, and
eHry deviation th .uufttah ni must be flagrant, and
even " damnable heresy." Such examples, to our ap­
prehension, are ju1tly classed amoog the lamentable
proofs ofthe esisteoce ofultra-sectarianism, even though
their authon cry out ever and anon with Jehu, " come !
aeo my zeal for the Lord !"
Without needlessly introducing the names o( individ­
uals or sects, and without set1ming to intermeddle with
, the domestic quarrels of any denomination, there are
some topics of universal concern, which have recentlr
resulted in the most notorious e:shibitiona of ultra-sec­
tarianism. Certain publications of Scriptural criticism-,
in which the doctrines of original sin, natural ability, im­
puted rigbteou1neu, regeneration, and a limited atone­
ment, &c., have been discussed and expounded - have
resulted in an agitation among one of the largest sects
in this country, which has continued to increase until
the entire body hns been convulsed, and a violent dis­
ruption of the ties which bound hundreds ofministers and
thousands of members to their mother church,. has been
the result. Thi• ecclesiastical decision, by the highest
court known to the sect, is eqnivalent to excommunica­
tion, and 1eems to have been prompted by a belief on
the part ofthe majority, that the minority held and taught
fundamental errors in doctrine. Meanwhile, the multi­
tudes of those who have suffllred excision from the
church oftheir choice, protest against all and singular
of the identical errors complained of, and proclaim their
readiness to subscribe anew to tho " Confession of
Faith," by which they have been adjudged heretics, only
rese"ing to tbemaelvea the right of private judgement
U L T R .A. • II E C T .A. R. I .A. N Ill H . 249
in their exegesis, and the additional right of varying the
stereotyped phraseology in which the doctrines of that
document hsve been heretofore expressed and taught.
Neither of the parties in this ultra-sectarian contro- -
versy may be satisfied with the accuracy of our exposi­
tion of the matter, though we aim to do justice to both.
But no commentary which we have seen, emanating
f
rom either, can entitli, the dispute and its results to ex�
emptio� from the charge of ultra-sectarianism. Indeed
the practice ofheresy.hunting which has been obviously
so ·rife in the denomination, the spirit and · manner in
which the act of excision bas been performed, and the
measures pursued thus f
ar by both parties since, as well
aa the ulterior movements in contemplation, all combine
to prove to a disinterested observer, that they have
" mistaken their particular denomination for the kingdom
of heaven." Both parties are mutually exhorting each
other to repentance, and for the sin of ultra-sectarian­
ism, they are both· open to the exhortation, and both iq
need of repentance.
In discussing and deciding these questions of hereti­
cal accusation, it is obvious that the. maxim of infidel
oppi>ser& and which they apply to Christianity distinct-,
ively, bas received some semblance of confirmation, for
. the rule of judgement seems to have been u my doxy
is orthodoxy; - your doxy is heterodoxy." For both
parties have subscribed and profess steadf
astly to adhere
to the same standards, while .each appeal to the saine
authorities for their diff
erent explications of the common
creed.
'
But the majority demand that their brethren
should expound the " Confession of Faith," in the old­
faahioned phraseology of t}\e sect ; thus proving their
adbesion to die deauls of doctrinal technicalities, aa

well u their coaformity to the creecl u a whole. The
minority hariag kept pace wilb the pragreu of humaa
pbiloaophy, and the spirit of the age have in� a
new and improved nomeoclature, which bu led to what
are called new meuurea, in one cla.-, aocl in another,
bu reaulted in �iviog for their ayatem the title of
"new divinity." The latterclaues fiod coo.eoience and
advantage u they think in these improvementa ;. while
the former regard them u dangerous and miachievoua.
Hence the miniatry ou botla eidee, have to aome extent
regarded it to be their special duty to introduce their
ultra-sectarian views into the pulpit ; and the mem­
benhip, ioatead of being made " wise_ unto salvation,"
by goepel sermons, a11 in olden time, when they .. preacb­
ed Cbri1t to the people," are eolighteeed by cliscoul'Htl
on the moral philoeophy of the old and new sclaools, and
built up by pulpit dillcuasioos, upon the knotty pointa o£
acbolastic divinity. · Those who mietake such employ•
ment of holy time, and such diacourses from � sacred
desk, for the discharge of the legitimate office of the
goapel mini1try, to whatever party they belong, are the
victilDll of humlrug.
The result.I have been precisely auch aa might have
been anticipated. Instead of ministers 1Uld churches
combining their energies for the salvati9n of men, and
devising as well u exflcut-ing plaoa for the conversioo
of the world, their frequent meetings are too often the
arena of ullra-1ectarian speeches and reaolutioos, which
engender strif
e and disaff
ection among brethren, while
the gre4t moral: inftoence which in their cborch capa­
city they should ever be wielding for the extension of the
Redeemer's kingdom, is giving place to patty spirit,
and the ultra-eectariao a-ccompliebmeot of some object

in ec�lesiastical politics. Such should be prevailed on
to " abandon to bigotted Mahomedans the absurd notion
thal fruth is confinee to our own party, that those who
do not speak as we do, are blind ; and that orthodozy
and aaltialion are plants which will scarcely grow aay
where but in our 11wn garden."
As a demonstration of the ultra-sectarianism we are
deprecating, let t�e reader look at the controversy raging
with so much vehemence in relation to the instrumen­
talities employed in the missionary work. Some coo­
tenJing that these must be conducted by " the church"
u such, while others insist that voluntary associations
in the church, imperia in iuipmo, are to be preferred.
Witness the suspicions, jealousies, and hostilities these
dissensions have developed, and the ultra-sectarianism
of both will be apparent ; for if their " e
ye were sibgle,"
and the success of Christian missions apart from secta­
ria11 interests were the common objects of both, neither
would envy or regret the prosperity of the other, but they
would mutually rejoice in and sustain each other, how­
ever they might agree to differ in relation to the compar-
ative superiority oftheir own plans. .
But it were alik� foreign to our inclination and incon­
sistent with our design to dwell minutely upon individual
de�ominational exhibitions of this form of ultraism,
since, unhappily, examples of similar spirit are visible in
all. It is among the most portentious of the signs of
the times, that the ministry and membership of Chris­
tian churches are to so great extent involved in this sin
of ultra-sectarianism, which is no less to be dreaded
than its opposite·, a sinful latitudinarianism. And it U.
f1dl time that all who are not infected with. it, and abhor
bigotry, intolerance, and every other form of religious
�52 t1 t. T & A • I & C 'l' U t U . It 1 8 ]If .
humbug, should combine against it by exhibiting more
of that liberality which rejoices to pronounce •• grace be
with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincer­
ity,'' &c.
There is, however, one aspect of this subject which
it would be criminal to omit, since the consequences are
110 embarrassing to missionary labours, and so disastreus
to the eff
orts and hopes of all who are labouring for the
conversion of the world. All such denominations agree
prof
essedly, in regarding the Bible and the Gospel Mis­
sionary as among the Divinely appointed instrumental­
ities for the overthrow of all false religions, and for the
establishment of Christianity. And they all profess, at
least, to preach none other gospel then " Jesus Vhrist
and him crucified." Nevertheless, with most lamentable
inconsistency, we find some evangelical denominations
so ultra-sectarian in their creeds and practice, that they
cannot unite with tHeir brethren of other denominations,
even in missionary labours, and must therefore have dis­
tinct fields assigned them in the land of heathenism,
which must be given up to their exclusive cultivation,
else they and their converts to .Christianity will be train­
ed up as a separate caste, who will have no more con­
geniality with the missionaries and proselytes of other
Christian denominations, than with the pagans around
them.
It is
'
this glaring fhct, and its obvious contrariety with
the successful propagation ofthe gospel among the hea­
then, which has led the celebrated author of .. the na­
tural history of enthusiasm " to publish a distinct work
designed to support the claims of " the established
church " of which he is 8 member, to exclusive pa�tici­
patiori in missionary labours. ·among the heathen, be-

cause oftheir " one church," " o_ne ministry," and " one
baptism," and but for the ultra-sectarianism ofthis work,
bis remarks a_re_ 'sensible and judicious. From similar
motives, others have been led to put in " a plea - for the
abolition -of all sects," as furnishing in thetr' VieW, the
only remedy for the evils of ultra-sectarianism in the
tnissionnTy work, evils which are every� day beeoming
·tnore apparent and more appalling._ But a better course
than either may be readily indicated, which is, the en­
tire relinquishment of party motives, and an ultra-secta­
rian spirit; if not at home, at least among the nations of
pagans and other heathens. for · whose conversiol\ to
Christianity, and- not to a sect, they claim to be la-
bouring.
,
There are. t.wo, among the prominent sects ofChristen­
dom, who are most deeply involved in the sin of embar-
1'assing, delaying, and hindering the conversion of the
world, especially so far as the heathen nations are con­
_cerned ;-and to these especially does the work ofreforma­
tion belong, unless they are prepared to put their ultra-
11er,tarianism into the scale, as of more· intrinsic value
than the- souls of men. The first of these is 'in the Bap­
tist denomination, a large portion of whose ministry and
membership cannot even unite with other Christians in
furnishing the Bible to heathen nations in their own
language, unless the word immerce is· substituted fur
baptize, where it occurs in our English translation; If
this be not the very climax of ultra-sectarianism, we
·despair of indicating its existence any where. But this
sect exhibit the same spirit, on a larger scale, in their
missionary labours among the heathen ; · and when other
denominations are attempting to Jabour in juxta-pos.1-
tlon with them, cultivating the same field, the most mel-
22
16' 11 L T & A • l l: C T A S J A 1' U ••
ucholy and nriaou.s feature• of ultra.seetanaolam .ire
'°°° developed among the couerted laeathen. The coo•
Y&IW of the Baptiat missionary having been io1tructetl
ill the nature of Cilristian- f
aith, are baptized_ by im­
mersioo,aud th118 far all ia well. Butuow they are taught
that no other mode is Scriptural, - that the converts
of o&her miasiooaries by whom spri.ukliog or pouring bu
been performed, are unbaptized. and by the. dogma of
" close communion," they are prohibited from uniting
at the Lord's table, in commemorating the death of
Chrillt, with any who have not been immersed, and w­
s.tructed that the sin of doing so, would be little short of
returning to their idols, or resuming the mummeries of
paganism which they have renounced.
Let a community of heathens dwelling in close prox­
imity with each other, have the gospel introduced among
them by two ormore missionaries, one ofwhomis anultra.
Baptist, and if they are mutually successful in making
converts, the proselytes of the latter by the necessary
tr.Uning of their ultra-sectarian teacher, may be as ef­
feq�ally estranged from Christian fellowship with those
9f the former, as they are from the idolatrous hea.
than ..-ound them. A partition-wall would be thWI
qrec;ted, which though deplorable in Christendom would
I>� in&itelr more disastrous on missi9oary ground,
where the absence of light and knowledge on kindred
aubjecl!!, must result in a confusion of tongues like that
of Babel.
·But there is another f�rm of ultra-sectarianism for.
which the Church of England, and the Protestant Epis­
copal Church are re�poosil>le ; and a� the latter has re.­
oeptly entered into the missionary work with laudabli;i
�l. the fruits of this SJ:>irit will soon 4ppear jn their dis;
1t L T :& A.• 9 E 'C T A. tl. I A. rf l S M .
taftt fields of lab()ur. · While as we have. seen, the BaJ)­
tist missionary would keep · his converts within his fold
t.y his proselyting and ultra-sectarian weapon of im­
mersion ; should his fellow:labourer be an -ultra-Episce-.
palian, all who are gathered into· his fold would be in­
structed that there is but one " true church of Christ,"
and that is his own, and that all others-are only " meet­
ting. houses." So also, they would be indoctrinated
into the belief, that there is but one " true minister of
Christ '·' in -the mission, and that all the rest are only
" preachers," not mifii3ters ; and of courso it is not law­
ful to receive the ordinances at any bands but bia.
Thus another partition-wait may be - erected, as high
and impassable, as that which is henceforth to separate
them from their o!d idolatrous and heathen system of
religion.
It were idle to discourse further upon so obvious a
truth as that such missionary labours scatter the seeds
of their own di3Solution; even lri the act of gathering in
the harvest with which they may be favoured by the
Lord of the vineyard. In planting Christianity in a
continent ofheathenism, such missionaries sow the tares
of strife, discord, and disaff
ection, among brethren ; and
in truth, they propagate the weaknesses, follies, and vices,
which encumber and .disgrace Christianity at home, in
foreign and heathen lands. They are led into this fatal
error by ultra-Sectarianism, which, however valuable in
1heir eyes, is an odious deformity in their creed ; a morbid
fang�s upon their body ecclesiastic,. and sits like an in•
eubus upon their power of doing good ; and demonstn­
bly is this the case in the foreign missionary field.
The evils thus depicted af!d deplored are not fanciful,
but real. And at this very hour they � operative and

at home and abroad. Nor will the world ever be con­
verted by such ultra-aec'tarian labours, by whomaoeve.
diapeDBed ; ao far from it, they ue an insuperable and
perpetual obstacle to this desirable consummation. And
it ia in this light especially that philanthropists and
Christians are called upon to mourn the existence of
this sin a"!oog the hosts ofProtestant Christendom, and
to labour for its extermination.
Nothing can be more certain, t�an that for the suc­
cesaful issue of missions among the heathen nations of
the earth, it is the dictate both of reason and Revelation,
of philosophy aod religion, that the simple unadulterated
word ofGod should be employed, and the gospel should
be preach_ed in its purity and simplicity, apart from the
theories of the schools, and the philosophy of scholastic
divines. Much more necessary il'I it, that the disputa­
tions, wars, and fightings, which are among us, should
not be even so much lls named am�ng the converted
heathen. Is it wise, prudent, or Christian-like, then, to.
induct the unsophisticated minds and hearts of converted
pagans into the dogmas of ultra-sectarianism ; or can
we expect from such a course aught, as the result of
our labours, but a spurious Christianity, little better than
the religion from which we would fain convert them.
lt is freely granted, that these ultra-views are not
entertained and practised upon by all who bear the
name of the denominations alluded to, and our stric­
tures only apply therefore, in justice, to those to whom
they belong, and for such only are they designed. But
wherever and whenever these and kindred evils exist,
and by whomsoever this spirit is manifested, we have an .
exbibitioo of what we call ultra:sectarianism, which we
U L T B A. •llll: C T A. R I A N I 8 11l . 257
denominate a humbug, an imposture, by which men
deceive others, and are themselves deceived. It is the
prevailing 11in of I.he church, the very '.' mystery of ini-
41Uity." In the forcible language of the Rev. Samuel
H. Cox, D. D. - " the sin of sectarianism appears to
be rottenne1,ts at the heart of the body, and poison in
the very soul of the church. It is a deadly . injury to
any denomination of our vaunted fondness; It consists
in exalfiog . local against universal interests ; private
against catholic views ; party against piety ; policy
againftt principle ; and our men, our measures, our
dectrines,or1r views, our prosperity, against the glorious
commonwealth of the King of Israel. And what is
� but exalting earth against heaven 1 It hardens the
heart of a minister of Christ, and converts him while it
_ justly lessens his intluenee, into a cruel inquisition..
Piety hence is nothing, but as party feels its influence.
If there �tl any sin denounced in the oracles of God u
the very quintessenee of deceitfulness, the very sublimity
oftreason, the very )lypocrisy of usurpation, - in short,
the very personification of the man of sin, the son of
perdition, - we have here tbe identity of the evil in the
u.,>er o
fuctarianiam. If this temper were well ana­
lyzed, it would be f
ound to consist of very unfovely and
anti-Christian ingredients. The elements of its com­
position would be found probably to be deceit, hypocri�!h
ambmon, aelfohneu, apprehenaiora, BUBpicion, envy,jeal.
ouy, sordid feelings, f
ahe zeal, and the wrath ofma9
uhich wor"kelh. not tlu righteoumua of God. Its holy
pretensions couti.tute one of its . worst characteristics ;
but another ofits worst is. the stealth and address with
which it often invades the tnll.ygood. No man is more
deaeived by it tho he whose self.complacency, beguil•

This qaotatioo is introduced, because of the Yigoroas
and nenoos style ia which the subject under notice ia
cleecribed ; but it clesenee a place ltere especially, be­
caUBe it is contained in one of the most wllra-.-:1""­
publications which this world has ever witnessed, aDll
to which an indirect reference bas �dy been had in
this chapter. The fact that such a man should be thus
beguiled into a reprobation of his own labours, shoulcl
remind us all of our owo infirmities, f
or " happy is he
who condemneth not himself in the thing which he
alloweth."
It would be absurd to expect among men of different
minds, absolute and perfect unif
ormity of sentiment on
any subject, whether secular or religious. No example
of such entire unity of views cao be f
ound upon earth ;
nor does the history either of the church or the world,
furnish evidence that at any periOd in past 'time, were _
men thus fully agreed in all reMpects touching any topie
of philosophy or morals. Diff
erences of opinion on
nri<rus minor points, existed among the patrntrchs,
prophets, and . apostleFJ, whose lives are written in the
book of Revelation ; nor have we any rational ground to
anticipate that absolute identity ofopinion will be attained
by the mass- of mankind, or by the multitudes who may
ultimately be numbered among Christendom, at any
future time, while men continue to be fallible, and while
-

their inteJlectual organization. is so various. Hence the
utopian project in which some have embarked, and in
the success of which many wise and good men have
lived and died, derives no authority either from reason
or revelation.
Nevertheless, the annihilation of what we denominate
ultra-sectarianism may be confidently looked for, as the
legiti�ate and necessary result of the prevalence of en- -
lightened Christianity. Recent developements in vari­
ous religious denominations in our own and other coun­
tries, are strongly indicative of approximation to th�s
desideratum ; and the evidence is before the world, that
there are those in the ministry and membership of diff
er­
ent churches who are prepared to feel and act in concert
for the formal renunciation ofthe sin ofultra-sectarianism.
Witness the hosts marshalled under the banner of the
British and Foreign Bible Society, the American Bible
Society, the great Temperance Reformation, and some
other great benevolent enterprises of the age. In these
and kindred associations for Christian eff
ort, multitudes
have learned to abhor their former · ultra-sflctarianism,
and loathe themselves on account of it. Retaining thflir
distinctive denominational organizations, they neverthe­
less see " eye to eye," in these " labours .Sf love," nor
can the remotest semblance of disunion be perceived or
lleteeted, among those who are fully enlisted in these
great and catholic objects.
As the fruit of a similar spirit volumes have been
Written, and essays furnished for the standard religious
periodi('als of lhe various churches, at home and abroad,
for tlie purpose of promoting " Christian Union ;" and
the " abolition of sects," among Protestant Christians
hae been seriously proposed, and elaborately advocated,
HO t1 L T R A. •8 K C T .A J U A Jll J • • ·
while very many modern theological critic• and sc:holan
have proclaimed their reawness to unite on some platferm
or common ground, whereon the substantials of Chris­
tianity may be retained, and the teclmicalities of ultra­
sectarianism be abandoned.
"Whatever may be the fate ofany or all of these cath­
olic and benevolent efforts, they must be regarded as
highly ominous of good. And although no one of the
existing sects of Protestant Christians may be either
di.solved, or amalgamated with others, yet there can be
little doubt that the master minds in many of them will
" come up altogether out of Egypt " upon this subject,
in their individual capacity ; and so f
ar as they are per-
1onally identified with the sin of ultra-sectarianism, they
will abjure and rupudiate it. forever. A variety of virtu­
ous and Christian metives may retain sucb, in intimate
and attached relation to the particular denomination of
their preference, and their inftuence ia such relation
cannot but be salutary ; while congeni1dity of soul will
unite them indissolubly to kindred spirits in their sister
churches, and their " little leaven will leaven the whole
lump." For it cannot be doubted, that enlightened
Christianity is slowly, but surely, dilapidating the parti• .
tioo-walls, once so high between different evangeli­
cal sects ; and that the�r utter demolition would not
more closely unite the hearts of many, whose fellow11hip
with their brethren ofother and diff
erent deoominations,
is now " without.a dimning veil between." Such have
mutually agreed to " forbear one another in Jove," and
�ugh bearing a diff
erent denominational name, they
have •i one Lord, one faith, and one. baptism," and they
love not in word only, but in deed and in truth.
Whether an organization ofsuch into a separate IUld
•

distinct church or denomination, is either practicable or
desirable, is a question which need not now be mooted.
The danger which might � .apprehended that they would
thus be<:9me ooly an " anti-sectarian sect," may be a
valid objection to such a step. But that there are maoy
in all the evangelical sects, at home an.d abroad, who are
sentimentally prepared to renounce " sectarian Chris·
tia11ity, for substantial Christianity,'' and could heartily
subscribe to a common creed, from the articles of which
every spice of ultra-sectarianism should be excluded, is
an opinion which cannot be doubted by any who are not
ignorant of " the signs ofthe times,!' Multitudes in all the
churches, are becoming more in love with their religion
than with their sect. Theybegin to venerate the substance
of Christianity, more than the jorm1 to which they bave
been accustomed, and their love to the " household of
faith," is as sincere and cordiaI to those who are without,
as within the pale of their own church. All such are
repenting of the sin of ultra-sectarianism, and their ex­
ample and testimony against it is more and more potent
in their chosen denomination. They remain in princi­
pled adhesion to their own sect, not because they deuy
or even doubt the piety, purity, or i:xcellence of others,
bot only because they find greater enjoyment, or better
opportunities of usefulness for the.111selves in its enclo­
sure. And while their conscientious preference is thus
given to their own creed, forms, and ceremonies of wor­
ship, they withhold not equal homage from their br<lthren
who prefer other creeds, forms, and ceremonies ofwor­
ship, while giving evidence of similar evangelical expe­
rience and practice.
That IJUCh examples are multiplying in Christendom
is among tho evidenc� and the. fruits of the prevalence
169 tJ t T R A • 8 II: C T A Jl l A 1' 1 8 !II ,
of entightened Christianity; and the 11pread of l!anctified
learning. Such men, when con11trained by duty to the
cause of truth, to bear testimony against Popery, in­
fidelity, heresy, error or sin, whether in chutches or indi­
viduals, do so in the name and on behalf of Christianity,
not of their own sect. When they engage in enterprises
for the reformation of sinners, and for the conversion
of the world, they will not expend their energies in
aiming to proselyte to any sect, not even their own, but
they will uniformly and consistently postpone all denom­
inational interests to the one great absorbing object, that
of extending the kingdom of Christ, and promoting the
aalvation of souls, irrespective of all party or sectarian
advantagi)S numerical or otherwise. Nor WQUld their
zeal be <liminished in the least, if they anticipated the
annihilation of their own and chosen denomination as a
distinct se
'
ct of Christendom, by reason of the success of
their catholic and Christian eff
orts. While others are
for Paul, Apollos, or Cephas ; - they are for Christ.
While others are clamorous for the success of Method­
ism, or Presbyterianism, Episcopalianism, or the ism
under which they are enrolled, the hearts and voices of
auch are ever exclaiming, Let Jesus reign t ·
As the examples of this spirit are multiplying in the
churches, a virtual union, ample for all practical purposes,
is rapidly developing itself, and with the reformation
from the sin of ultra-sectarianism, a conservative influ­
ence is accumulating an amount of strength and power
which argues the downfall of ultraiam in every other de­
partment. Nor cal) this result be looked for by any
other instrumentality ; and we denominate this irifluence
conservative because it is eminently so, and for the ad­
ditional reason that ·the reign of humbug in church and
I
U L T R A • I K C T A R I A l'U S M , 263
state, is neces1$arily destructive and ruinous ; if it be not
arrested by the epeedy overthrow of the
.
ultras, who are
ever the most active, zealous, and indomitable agents,
not only in the various benevolent and religious sects,
but as demonstrably in the departments of politics, phi­
losophy, and morals.
It was forcibly stated bya distinguished scholar and
divine, on a recent public occasion, that Satan is the
grand a.dversary who has adopted ultraiam as his own
subtle device. And when he cannot otherwise arreiit
or defeat any good or great object, he modestly proff
ers
to become himself the postillion, that he may hasten its
progress. Men are so " ignoraRt of his devices," that
in their zeal to
.
" go ahead," they give the reins of the
car to this Jehu of ultraism, and thus hope to hasten on
even a good cause, while the devil dri,,ea ! And that
this ancient driver has lost none of his destructive char•
acteristics since he drove a " herd of swine down a steep
place into the sea," need not be argued. The ruin and
devastation of this " go ahead " system, in the present
secular and political aspect of the nation, as well as in
matters of science, philanthropy, and religion, are no
where more apparent than in New-York. Witness the
rage for speculation, and gambling in stocks and real
estate, which has engulphed so many of our citizens,
and well nigh ruined many of the members of Christian
churches. See the strife and tumult in relation to
Banks and no Banks, specie and paper currency, -
mark the luxury, excesses, and wild extravagances which
are exhibited by every party, and the heated controver­
sies which have been engendered on a great variety of
topics. Witness the state of the political and religious
press among us, �d listen to the harangues ?f fiel'.1

zealots aod demagogues o o almost every topic of
excitement, and we shall be constrained to admit that
the strange infatuation of ultraism aod humbuggery, is
threateDing to overwhelm the- entire population. Nor is
it irrational to suppose that such results are the conse­
quence ofsome infernal agency, and that the locomotives
by which the community seem tobe impelled so furi<?us­
ly, are " set on fire of hell."
In the foregoing pages, a number of the humbugs by
which the p_ublic have been gulled, have been separately
examined, with the view of exposing in the sun-light of
truth their heinous character, and their mischievous ten­
dency. And a feeble attempt has �een made at remon­
strance and expostulation with the inf
atuated dupes of
these flagrant delusions. But there are a great variety
of examples no less to be deprecated because of their
intrinsic vileness, and most deplorable consequences, to
which no allusion has. been made, alrhough the citizens
of New-York are greedily bolting them down with
equally marvellous gullibility. N or is it possible to
keE>p pace with the rapidity with which new and success­
ful humbugs are introduced among us.
Since this work bas been in the press, although but a
feW weeks have elapsed, another has been added to the
religious humbugs which already abound in t�is great
city. It is scarcely credible, and yet it is lamentably
true, that the horrid profanities and unblushing blas­
phemies of MoaMO:'iISM ! have been belched forth to ·
crowds of gaping fools in the city of New-York. The
agent in this new monstrosity, calling himselfan ELDER,
bas found a professed minister and Christian congrega­
tion, so called, in our midst, who have allowed the. Sab­
bath to be outraged and their temple of religion desecra-
1' 1. T 1U. • 8 B t t' A. B U . 1 0 1 JI. 265
ted by the public propagation ofdie myateriell of Mer­
mo.U-1 · The effect bas been precisely as with any and
•very other imposture however foul and revolting to
truth and decency. Multitudes who believe in "Ani­
mal Magnetism.,'' subscribe to " Phrenology," are the
willing victims of every form of " Quackery," and have
adopted the creed and practice of " ultraism ;" - multi­
tudes ofsuch, have gathered around this Monnonoracle,
and drank in wisdom from· his " golden bible I" The
entire community of infidels at Tammany Hall, hailed
bis arrival as auxiliary to their cause, and welcomed him
to their Temple of Reason, substituting his ministra­
tions for their own Atheistical e�ibitioos on the Sabbath
day. And the " halfhas not yet been told," for already
scores of disciples have been rallied around the standard
of Mormonism, from among the members of Christian
churches ! many of whom have been re-baptiaed by tlri8
BLDEB, into the new religion ! and thus this mo11t shock­
ing humbug has been domiciliated among · us. Nor
will it cease to spread, until lik\l tlie kindred enormities
of Matthias, some high-handed and out-breaking in­
iquity shall wind up its history in pollution, infamy, and
blood.
.
But we forbear to enlarg� on this prolific theme,
si.(ice surely it is " enough to make one harig his head,
and blush to own himself a man," when such humilia­
ting and degrading exhibitions of besotted stupidity are
multiplying on every hand� Nor is it pos�ible to im­
agine or conceive an imposture, wheth�r old or new,
which is too base, or o.bscene, or iafamous, or stupid, to
make proselytes in this city of New-York ; and from
some of these eumple11 it is plain, that the more igno-
23
266 U L.T B ..l • I E C 'l' A B J A 1 U f llf ,
rantand depravedthe agents employed in propagating· ift
the greater will be its success. Has " reason fled to
bru�h beasts 1" or are our citizens given over to strong
delusioos t And is there no remedy 1 Verily,1here is
reason to f
ear that unless the clominion of humbug
among the more enlightened portion of our population,
can be overthrown ; the prevalence and success of these
impostures in the lower walks oflife, will neutralize civil­
ization itself, and savage barbarism, such as the " abom­
ination . of desolation " itself, will become rif
e in the
midst of this London of America.
Let it never be forgotten, that the grosser and more
loathsome class of impostures which shock the sensi­
bilities of the more refined porti.on of thu community,
owe their existence and perpctuati-cn to the reception
which the more polished humbugs receive, among those
who claim to belong to " good society." Nor can we
justly reproach the ignorant and depraved, for being be­
witched out of their senses by vulgar and fiftby humbuge,
while the example of those to whom they are ever in­
debted, continues - to proloog the reign of imposture by
similar gullibility, thus establishing in their own persons
the f
ashion of humbug. Nor need we wonder, if under
such circumstances, we should witness radicalism, agra­
rianism, and infidelity springing up, and flourishing or.
a•ery hand.
It is full time that our citizens were awake to this im­
portant subject, and this bumble attempt has been made
with the design of · furnishing an antidote to prevalent
f
anaticism, if haply the author can succeed in gaining
the public eye and ear. For l!hould popular delusion
continue to spread, and public gullibility persist in swal-
U L T R A • S E C T A R I A l( 1 8 M . 267
lowing every monstrosity which impostors shall have the
ingenuity and depravity to devise ; our city and common
country, will be cursed with moral blasting and mil­
dew, and science, philanthropy, and religion itself, will
all be . supplanted to conform to the fashion of the
age, which may justly be den()minated, - " the age of
humbug." -

Tur. STORY OF GRACE HARRIET, the Little Sufferer.
Sold for the benefit of her family.
This very interesting little book, published under the
sanction of the Executive Committee of the General
Protestant Episcopal Sunday-School Union, is written
by a lady, and narrates iu familiar and pleasing language
the character of a little girl, who, at the �ge of ten yea.rs,
had acquired such a knowledge of her Saviour, as few in­
dividuals even at a far more advanced period of lif
e ob­
tain. Grace Harriet, had she lived, would no doubt
have been an ornament to her religious profession_ ; for
styled " the little 8'J.fferer," which, from the account
given of her she must have been, she was at the same
time the happy Christian - a child in years - a saint-in
au
ff
e1·ingI But it pleased Gon to terminate he.r afflic­
tions, and to take her early -to his rest. No one, we
presume, will read these pages without profit. They are,
moreover, worthy the perusal of all ; they set forth very
strikingly the importance of Sunday-School in�truc_tion,
and exhibit the value of our city missions. Had not this
young Christian become the object of the aff
ectionate
care and earnest solicitude of her excellent frierid and
• pastor, neither we, nor even the writer of her memoir,
-
might ever have heard of her. But our missionaries
seek out the retreats of misery aod wretchedness ; and
many are the interesting, though oftener melancholy,
scenes with which they become acquainted, aqd have it
in their power to make known. As this little book is
published for the benefit of1l distressed widow, and its
contents meet with our approbation, we hope it will have
a very extensive sale. We therefore recommend it to
the favourable notice of our Christian friends in general.

THE STORY OF GRACE HARRIET, the Little Sufferer ;
who died in New- York, .!l.pril 1 5, 1837.
By the publication of this interesting narrative, the
libraries of our Sunday Schools will receive a most
valuable addition to their moral and iutellectual treas­
ures., The.simple and touching sfory ofactual suffering,
and the uncomplaining meekness _with which, under the
influence of grace in the heart, it is borne, can hardly
fail to prove useful to any reader, but especially to the
young, whose unsophisticated hearts are so tenderly alive
to the calls of sympathy. The almost iucredible iillff
er­
iog, the wonderful patienqe, the uncnmmon maturity,
and the sweet amiableness of GRACE HARRI ET, all liv­
ing and breathing through the medium of the deepest
and simplest piety, make this one of the most.interesting
and instructive books for childreu that we have seen.
Nor is the interest or effect of the story in any degree
diminished by the fact, that " Grace " was one ofw -
that this remarkable. child was one of the commoe poor
of New-York, of whom so many thousands are passing
daily before our eyei;:, telling by their looks, more loudly
than by their beseeching tones, the sad tales of their
wants. Many children who read the book will remem­
ber the interesting subject of it ; and it is to be hoped
that not only they, but all who find their hearts mo\•ed
to sympathy by this simple story of actual distress, will
remember that there are thousands of casP.s within their
r0!lch, if not in all respects similar, yet loudly de manding
the aid and the sympathy of those who have abundance ;
and while, as they read, a hundred plans will Bash across
their minds, by which they could have relieved the wants
and mitigated the sufferings of Grace, let them not for11:et
that the same plans will now answer, to relieve the wants
and soothe theanguish of the livingsufferers around them.
But our object was not to dwell upon the subject of
the book, so much as to commend it to the perusal-ef all
of every age, who love to witness &n exhibition of the
power of true religion, in imparting comfort and strength
to the soul, when every other source is dried up ; or
who ta�e any interest in actual Illustrations ofthat beau·
tifu) declaration of Scripture - " Out of the mouth of
Jtabes, thou hut perfected praise;"

[From the New-York Oblerver, Feb. UL}
TeB STORY OI' Giu.oa.
This is one ofthe mOtJt interesting and attractive little
volumes, which has recently issued from the preb.
Grace was the daughter ofa poor widow, who h'ad been
reduced from comparative afll.uence to the most abject
poverty. She died, about the age of tm years, of a
disease in the spine, after protracted and most intense
suff
ering. The main incidents of the book are furnishd
from the last two years ofher life, and show the wonder­
ful power of religion, in enabling the little suff
erer to
bear with patience the dreadful disease, which cgn­
signed her to an early grave. The book is replete with
touching incidents, and is commended to all, who love
to " f
eel for other's woes," as highly instructive and
useful. It is written in a fine, flowing style, and re­
markably free from those literary defects, which too
often mar our Sabbath-School publications. The book
is publi:c<hed by John S. Taylor, in the elegant.style for
which his publications are distinguished. It has two
beautiful and significant engravingll. The avails of
the book are to be applied to the support of the wid­
owed mother and her family ; and surely, after reading
the book, no one will regret having contributed a few
cents to alleviate the wants of so interesting and unfortu­
nate a woman.
[From the Christian Intelligencer, Jo"eb. 10.) ·
TnE STORY oF GRACE.
This is an exceedingly interesting narrative, beauti­
fully exhibiting the influence of religion, in the case ofa
child, who died at the age of ten years, having been af
­
fticted for a length oftime, with an excruciating aff
ection
.of the spine. .Every Christian, of whatevi>r denomina­
tion, will read it with deep and fixed interest, and be
prepared to recommend its introduction in the circle of
youth and children around him. It is filled with inte­
resting incidents, and shows an aff
ec·1ing instance of
piety . in early youth shining forth, and cheering amid
severe and protracted suff
erings. It has been approved
by the Executive Committte of the General Protestant
Episcopal Sunday-School Union, in the conimunion of
which, little Grace was a member. It is however
adapted to the Sabbath-Schools ofother denominations.
