Experience Description 9391:   

I was sick with a bad stomach bug/infection where I dehydrated and my blood pressure dropped down to 80/64. My grandmother told me that I passed out only for about 20 seconds. Within those 20 seconds it felt like 20 minutes went by. I found myself standing in a very dark hallway and couldn't see anything. I started moving through the hallway, yet my feet were about a foot off the floor. I eventually saw a door at the end of the hallway.  There was an intense light coming from the seams of the closed door. Just before the door, the room widened a little bit and there was a table on my right just a few feet off the floor.  My grandfather, who died 4 years prior, was standing between the door and the table. He spoke to me without moving his lips and said, 'It's not your time.' I immediately woke up. 

While standing in front of the door, I could feel the Immense Love and light coming from the door. The Love feeling was so much more powerful than anyone could imagine. I wanted to see what was beyond the door.

 I don't believe that the image of my grandfather was actually him.  I think it was Jesus taking on my grandfather's form so I wouldn't  be afraid. After I awoke, I told my grandmother about the occurrence and she believed me.

Experience Description 8380:   

    I had a stomach infection.  I was dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea.  I fell unconscious and woke up in a long, dark hallway. I moved through the hallway. It wasn't like I was  walking, but floating a few inches off the ground. I came to a door that was closed but it had a bright, blinding light coming from the seams of the door. My grandfather, who died in 1996, was standing in front of the door. Without moving his lips, he told me, 'Ronny, it's not your time .'  I woke up instantly. 

My grandmother told me I was unconscious for only 15-20 seconds but in the hallway it felt like 15 minutes.
