UNPREJUDICED AND REFLECTING PROTESTANTS
OJ.' THE UNITED EMPIRE.
Mv FRIENDs,-It is a melancholy fact, that thousands
of Protestants, who take credit for being the most enlightened
and impartial, are yet the most shamefully imposed upon,
and more seduced than those of other denominations. There
appears to be no falsehood too gross, nor calumny too
unfounded for them, where " popery'' is concerned. There
is no tract too vile against" Romanism and Monker.," they
will not circulate, provided " the good cause" is serve~.! ·' it.
How can those, who say the attainment of truth is their
only object, and who are for ever talking of the holy volume;
yet remorselessly aid the circulation of tracts and books
filled with '' false evidence against their neighbour?" Is
this Christianity? Is it justice? Is it honesty? Is it doing
as they would be done by ? When we published the first
Irish edition of the " Answer to R. Reeas' Six Montlts in a
Convent,'" we did not imagine we wouldhave sosoontonotice
a production of a similar nature, still more barefaced and
atrocious. It would be an offence to the ears of chastity,
an insult on the judgment of the wise, and an abuse of
the patience of the virtuous, to notice in detail the infamous
slanders and incomparable falsehoods of a work which was
published in January, 1836, in New York, under the title
of" Awful Disclosures, by Maria Monk" This production
was got up to calumniate the Catholic religious establish-
ments at Montreal; but its lies were so gross as to recoil
upon its abandoned author and its infamous supporters.
'l'he evidence which we subjoin to these reflections must
satisfy even the most sceptical, that a greater tissue of Jieg
never was circulutecl than this wol'k contains.
From the recent attacks made by the fanatics in America
the Catholic religious females, their intolerant support-
in Great Britain, wishing to imitate their example, have
""'"'uu....,.,ocu the most unprincipled productions of the transat-
haters of '' popery," conceiving that they would be
liable to detection than home-manufactured slanders.
We call upon Protestants of all denominations, if they
truth and hate lies, to discountenance the scandalous
attacks now made upon the religious female Catholic
institutions. Where is the honest Protestant despising false-
end misrepresentations, who believes the atrocious fabri-
cations ofsuch self-condemned characters as Reed and Monk;
the first denounced by the Protestant Committee, who in-
quired into the state of the Ursuline Convent at Charleston;
and tho other branded in a public court of justice, as un-
wotthy of all credit? And what is the object of the present
unholy warfare against religious institutions ? Is it to
promote femalb virtue, or to increase the obedience or im-
provement of youth? Suppose that the enemies of Monas-
teries and Convents obtained the destruction of all religious
communities, would they thereby check immorality, or
advance the character of our country ? Where would we
then find thousands ready and willing, at all hours, to
instruct the children of the poor gratuitously; or like the
good Samaritan, to pour the oil of comfort into the bosom
of distress? Have not the instructions and example of
the religious in Ireland preserved the female character
of our country, when the rulers of other nations, (whose
" liberalizing policy" opposed those thus consecrated to
God,) have destroyed that of the fairest portion of creation?
If some infuriated fanatics were to follow up the anti-
christian work, performed by those of a similar character in
America, what would be the consequence? Perhaps the
destruction of their own offt~pring, as happened there, would
be the first fruits ; the ramparts which religion has b~ilt up
would be removed-licentiousness would be aided in its
satanic work-the number of profligates and prostitutes
would rapidly increase; and vice, in all its terrific forms,
would assail even the bosom of our peaceful dwellings !

Could they ever teach the starving peasant, or his
offspring, such submission to Providence, and such ooea11enOE
to the laws, as they are now taught ? Could they
with all their " reason and philosophy" alone, induce
to submit, as they are now taught to submit, to the
and hardships of their degraded state, to avoid e\·ery
of malice and revenge, even against their worst n"'"""""1~n"'"·
and to love even their worst enemiee, as Chnst loved
executioners ?
But why ask these questions? Has not every reene,ctable
Protestant landlord, from the Duke of Leinster to Sir
Keane, seen by experience, that whilat those of their
community, who have been paid for and sworn to teach
schools, have neglected that duty, religious Catholic
and nuns have sacrificed their property, and nearly
lives, to instruct, comfort, and support the poor ?
is it not a fact, that whilst Protestant charter schools
been denounced and suppressed by Parliament, as incom
petent to their professed original purpose of pro11notma
rt>ligion or morality, the Erlucation Commissioners
found none more deserving of support, than the schoo
kept by the male and female religious of Ireland ?
If Mr. Percival (like many other Protestants who .;.i.)
inquire, but are deceived by the infamoue lies alluded to
called upon one of the Ministry to institute a
Inquisition against the female religious, perhaps w1th
same intf 1tions of Sir Henry Mildmay, who introduced
bill into the British Parliament, in 1800, for the ·
of Nunneries; let it be remembered, that the
O'Leary, in his admirable ''Address to tlte
tual and Temporal," so triumphantly exposed this effort
and so much shamed its authors, that the bill was imme-
diately cushioned.! Well did this iliush·ious man say :
" The legislature of 91 made this distinction in the L""~'""''·mn

They arc of the greatest use to the Catholic nobility
who send their daughters to be educated by them, on
the strictnPss of their morals, their seclusion from the
of the world, which affords them the more time to IIU·
ln~>rint.>.,,ti the instruction of thei1• scholars, and the facility of obaerving
exercises peculiar to the Catholic religion, such a~ fasts, absti-
confessions, communions, &c., which could not be observed
boarding schools ; and which, though they may appea1· ridi-
to others, are held sacred by us. In Galway, in Ireland, there
are ladies of this description, since the convertoion of the kingdom
to Chri.itianity in the fourth century. The parliament~ however
rigorous in angry times, never molested them, on account of their
utility, by their instructions, besides the policy of spending their
money in the country; for if there were not ladie~:~ of this descrip-
tion in the country, the Catholic& would send their daughters to be
educated abroad."
"In an age of profligacy, when so many wise and virtuous mem-
bers of the Legislature iutended to int1·oduce a law for the security
of the marriage bed ; when divorces, in~tead of constant affection, are
the frequent fruits of ma~rimony ; amidst so many seminarictl of
lewdness, and cities becom,l!, on account of vice and corruption, so
many criminal Ninivitel!, which would require a Jonas to induce
them to •·epent in sackcloth and ashes ; streets infested with lewd
females, from the age of eleven to the period at which the effects of a
crime that carries with it its own punishmeat, and the enormous
number of which wretches, a magistrate, who has written a book on
the police of London, computes at fifty thousand annually! Amidst
such scenes of vice, is the chastity of a few Catholic women an object
of so alarming a nature, as to deserve the attention of the first senate
on earth, especially as it is in their power to renounce their state of
celibacy when they choose ? Perhap~ not two hundred of them would
bind themselves to a single life in the space of fifty years. lf their
number wei'e multiplied to ten times, or to a thousand times more,
what are they when compared to the great number of immoral and
unchaste all over England? About twenty or thirty atoms floating
on the surface of an immense ocean. Rari nantes in gurgite vasto.
'' Were it the custom amongst Quakers, Anabaptists, Moravian!!,
or any other sect or de~cription of people, to have women of a solitary
cat~t or disposition of mind amongst them, who from fanaticism or in-
clination, would choose to lead a retired lire, and superintend the edu-
cation of the females of their sects, Sir Henry MiidmRy would rather

Let not boneet and candid Protestants say, that the
of fanatics, when encouraged, may not produce bad effects
or that those who circulate these lying and calumnious
ductions, are not responsible for the consequences. It m
be seen from the following extract, that an Orange
in Dublin, from what he audaciously calls Lis '' chair
truth," has called upon his wicked confederates (as he
upon a late occasion, to insult the citizens, and
their lives,) to destroy the asylums of peace,
and ·religion:
" The following arc a few extracts from a sermon preached
Sunday evening, 6th March, by JoHNNY M'CREA, who is c
Protestant Minister. We are scarcely justified in calling them
ravings of a fanatic, as we do not believe the man sincere in his
madness. They have been sent to us by a correspondent, who can
substantiate the truth of the report by affidavit. If M'CR.EA had
not been recognised as the chaplain of a Dublin Orange lodge, he
should be as unheeded by us aii ' the dog that bv.ys the moon.'
" ' I know and foresee, my friends, ere many months, that the
true Protestants of this island will level every convent and Popish
altar in it. Mind, I do not make it a request of you to do so;
but it is my own opinion that it will be done.'
" Again, in speaking of the Catholic c:mrch, he designated it all
througit by that infamous title for female ears to listen to (of whom
there were many present) 'that bloody w--! that Antichrist!'
" In one of the prayers, whir.h he delivered extempore, he prayed
' that the Almighty might turll the head of the executive in this
country from his Popish ways !'
" I forgot to mention, that in advising his auditory (composed of
the lowest of the Orange faction) to destroy the convents and altars,
he instanced the ' good people of America;' and desired them to
follow the example set by the' Lynch-law' rt..ffians."-IP'eekly Free-
man, 12th March, 1836.
The hypocritical idea, that such Ratanic
" promote pure protestantism" even in the
of its most stern defendere, will render it the more
abominable, and such efforts would only make the instigators
the more culpable. Thus, when an application was made in
l~ngland to show lenity to the rioters of London, in 1780,
callerl Lord (~eorg·e Gordon's mob, " Ul'Cause those who firRt
8
in it c.li<l ~o from the conscientioui! motive of pro-
"'"'•"·'~ protestantism," the great Edmund Burke d~clared,
Lorcl John Russell observed, some months since, in his
y to the memorial on behalf of the Dorchester labourers)
those who were the originators were more culpahle than
those who werP seduced to follow their example for the sake
of plunder." We therefore hope that you, my Protestant
friends, will despise the efforts of such fanatics, and whilst
you hold, from conscientious motives, your own creed, will
allow us to enjoy in peace, the blessings of our religion
and the advantages of our religious communities. As for
thot>e who have aided in propagating the slanders of Rebecca
Reed and Maria Monk, WP. call their attention to the follow-
ing observations of an eminent divine, on the baneful
consequences of such publications :-
" The authors and promulgators of immoral or slanderous works,
may, it is true, repent of their crime, but can never recal the
mischief, as it branches out into endless ramifications, and goes
down to the latest posterity. The only repa.ration they can make,
is for the future to do all the good they can, in order to atone, in
some measure, for the evil effects of their writings."
But whilst there are prejudiced and unprincip!ed persons
fabricating lying stories, fo1· the purpose of reviling our
religion, and blackening the character of our religious insti-
tutions, it is very gratifying to our feelings to find so many
of our unprejudiced and enlightened Protestant brethren
coming forward promptly and generously to vindicate us,
and rescue the character of the innocent of our community,
when attacked by those uncharitable calumniators, who
think it no crime to rob their fellow-creature of his good
fame ; like the murderers of their Lord and Saviour, who
took away his life becaus~ they considered him as an obstacle
to their designs, and an exposer of their hypocrisies.

TH E
FABRICATION OF MARIA MONK
DETECTED AND EXPOSED.
In commencing the exposure of Maria Monk's falsehoodA,
we cite the following from a Dublin journal :-·
" From the columns of a Montreal paper we learn, that
the system, of which Rebecca Reed was the first agent, has
found another and a fitting tool in the person of a young
woman of light mind and Q.epraved habits, named 1\laria
Monk, a native of Montreal. From the depositions of
Doctor Robinson, a justice of the peace tor Montreal, it
would appear that in November, 1834, a young woman was
found in the neighbourhood in a des~tute condition, who
stated that she was the daughter of a Dr. Robinson. Upon
being confront('d, however, with her albged father, she
admitted that she had uttered an untruth ; and that in
reality her father was one William Monk, of that city. She
stated, that in consequence of temporary insanity, to which
she was subject, her parents had kept :her chained in a cellar
for four years. When it was remarked to her that her per-
son bore no marks of manacles; or any other mode of res·
traint, she replied that her mother took care to cover the
irons with soft cloths to prevent them injuring the skin.
From this time until August last Dr. Robinson lost sight of
this strange story-teller. It would seem, however, that in
the interval she made her appearance in New York, in a
very destitute condition, where she excited the interest of
the lovers of the marvellous and the haters of Popery, by
alleging all manner of crimes against the monks and nuns
of the General Hospital of Montreal, out of which place
she asserted she had escaped. It is said the authorities at
New York deputed a Mr. Boyte (who represented himsalf
10
as a clergyman) and two other gentlemen to accompany thE'
retched woman to Montreal, to make inquiry in reference
to the truth of her statement. And in August last Mr.
Robinsoa.was waited upon by several inhabitants of Montreal,
requested that he would, as u magistrate, institute an
· into ' some very serious charges which had been
against certain Roman Catholic priests of the place
and the nuns of the General Hospital, by a female who had
been a nun in that establishment for four years, and who had
divulged the horrible secrets of that establishment, such as
the illicit and criminal intercourse between the nuns and the
priests, stating particulars of much depravity of conduct on
the part of these people, in this respect, and their murder-
ing the offspring of these criminal connections, as soon
as they were born, to the number of from thirty to forty
every year.' Dr. Robinson at once declared that he did
not believe there was the slightest truth in the allegations.
He consented, however, to see the wretched woman alluded
to, and he then found that she was the same who had, some
months previously, told such a strange story of her own
parents. She repeatec1, in Dr. Robinson's presence, the
allegations we have mentioned above, stating that she had
been four years in a convent, and had taken the black veil.
'I was asked to take her deposition (says Dr. Robinson) on
her oath as to the truth of what she stated. I declined doing
so, giving as a reason, that, from my knowledge of her cha-
racter, I considered her aRsertions upon oath were not en-
titled to more credit than her bare declaration, and that I
did not b~!lit;ve eitht:r; intimating, at the same time, my
willingness to take the necessary steps for a full investigation,
if they could get any other person to corroborate any part
of her solemn testimony, or if a direct charge were made
against any particular individual of a criminal nature.'
'' The widowed mother of the unfortunate creature, a
Protestant, too, came forward and swore that her daughter
was nevt>t' in a nur.ne•·y, unless when, at the age of eight
year~, she went to school in such an establishment. She
further swore that Boyte was very p•·essing in his solicita-
tions that she (Mrs. Monk) would make out that her daughter
had been in a nunnery. He stated, says the writer, ' that

the character of this pretended llull. Upon her return to

positively appear that Hoyte was the father of the bantling,
but from his couduct in regard to it and its unfortunate mo-
ther, the fact is rendered more than suspicious." Morning
Register.
" We perceive that the pious publishers of Protestant
" Pious Frauds," are zealously placarding the revelations of
Miss Maria Monk-revelations in one sense certainly; for
the facts put forth by her had no previous earthly existence,
unless in the shape of a work published some 100 years
before. Still the vilification goes on; and the Irish saint~·
pander to the prurient imagination of all who can digest a
lie for the enjoyment of the filthy luxury whicl1 is its ac-
cessary. We copy the following paragraph from the Liver-
pool Journal in r~ference to this base and malignant tissue
of lieo :-
" ' It is likely that the pious slanderers of Catholicity (who arc
Legion in this city) may send to the illiberal 110rtion of the Briti~h
press copies of a vile pamphlet, called" Awful Disclosure~, by Maria
Monk," hich they ha'Ve lately publi~hed here. If notice be taken
of thi:~ work in your dty, the following facts may be of use to you.
In the yea&· 1731. a book was published called 'The Gates of Hell
opened, or a Development of the Secret:~ of Nunneries.' Mi~~
Maria Monk's pamphlet is a verbatim copy of that work ! the only
ditlercnce being t.he change of nameA. IJr. Bartlett, the editor of the
IJoston Po.Yt, pledged himself, a week Rince, that thi~ was the fact, and

of the 'Awful Disclosures.' Ther copy pages from both works,
which are the same, word for word• .,-16id.
_. We shall now lay before an impartial public, evidence
sufficient to prove that no Protestant, who values truth and
justice, can aid, even in the most remote way, the circulation
of the tissue of lies, signed Maria Monk.
· The first shall be the universal testimonietl of the Protes··
tant Journalists at Montreal, where the religious institutes,
KO grossly reviled, are establisht>d. ·
The second shall be the sworn testimony of those who
were b£>St acquainted with the character of the said Maria
Monk.
" The first publication of this calumny against thP. priest:
hood and nuns of Montreal, appeared in a New York 'ie~
ligiom;' (?) paper, called the Protestant Vindicator. Tlie
number in which the infamous libel appeared, was dati.'ld
14th October, 1835, three months previous to tlie appe~r;
ance of the book ; it reached Montreal four or five day~
after, and was met by immediate and unanimous contradic-
tion from the whole of the Protestant press of the province.
These contradictions are of the most unqualified character ;
and as the parties from whom they emanated are, for the
most part, politically oppm;2d to the section of the popula·
tion to which the priests belong, they are at once honourable
to the good feelings of the witnesses, and of course the mpre
valuable as evidence.
" We shall commence with the evidence of the ltlontreal
Herald, in favour of the unimpeachable character of the
calumniated persons. After a paragraph which it is not
necessary to quote, the Herald proceeds as follow~>:-
• • • ' The first editorial article is entitled ' Nunneries,' and is
intended to be an exposure of debauchery and murder, said to have
taken place in the Hbtel Dieu in this city. We will not disgrace our
columns, nor disgust our readers, by copying the false, the abominably
false article. Though of a different religious persuasion from the
priests and the nuns; we have had too m'any opportunities of witnessing
their unwearied assiduity •·and watchfulness, and Christian charity,

highly respected, and r11c.1

persuasions, than the Roman Catholic priests of Montreal. The
• Sistet•s of Charity' are equally respected, and are the means or
effecting important services to the community. They practi1e
Christianity, by feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, protecting
the orphan, and ministering to the sick, the afflicted, and the dying-
' pursuing the noiseleoas tenor of their way,' courting no popular
applausp, and seeking their sole reward in ' conscience void of offence
towards God and man.' We do not pretend to be defenders of the
Ronnn Catholic religion, or of any of itt! particular institutions. We
are Protestants, and glory in being so ; but we will not so far forget
the precepts of onr divine Master, as to connive at traducing the
character of individuals, who are exemplary members o! society. ,
nlthough they are of a different religious persuasion from ourselves!•
., The Montreal Gazette, another journal of similar poli-
tics, and conducted by Protestants, is equally unqnalified in
its teetimony in favour of the calumniated, and equally in-
dignant in its condemnation of the calumniators. We select
the following passages:-
• • • ' From our infancy we have resided in this city, and we
therefore may be supposed to know the characters of the Roman
Catholic clergy and the nuns, somewhat better than any itinerant
preacher from the United StateM. Their constant and unremitted.
attention to the diacharge of their parochial duties-their kind and
affectionate attendance upon the sick, at all seasons, but more parti·
cularly during the severe visitations of pestilence, have excited general
admiration and approval from the believers in other creeds-their
numerous acts of charity and benevolence are experienced by
!lands, whose wants and sufferings have been relieved from the fund•
at their disposal-their character for unblemished purity and morality
has stood unimpeached, until a worthless and anonymous scribbler
has dared to impugn ~heir hitherto unsullied reputations. • • • •
' It is superlatively ridiculous to suppose, that while these institu-
tions are open daily to the visits of our citizens, and their inmates are
11een at all hours attending to their religious &.vocations, such events
llhould occur as have been described, and yet be unknown to the
public until ushered into notice by a New York paper. The palpable
errors with which the article teems, as to the title and qualification•
of some of the clergy, betray its origin, and point it out as the pro-
duction of one, who has raised u~ the creature of his imagination.
with a view to injure the Roman Catholic religion, and to support hie
own ilhberal views.'
" The other English papers of Montreal added their vo-
luntary teetimony to the same effect, as did also those of
Quebec ; from one of which we shall content ouriieh•es with
a single quotation. It is from the Quebec Mercury:.......,
' The falsehood of this, pretP.mled, Protestant Vindicator, is ._,
revolting and gt·oa~, and couched in terms so coarsE-, that we t:aft
a
14
no quotation from it, nor even more particularly allude to it,
to say, in contradiction of the infamous slander to which it
ven birth, that having passed the greater part of our life in thie
ce, in which we hav1~ an extensive acquaintance, we have
lmown any ladies who had been educated in either of the nun·
of thi& city, and of Montreal, who did not in after-life retain
warmest affection for the religiout~ ladies who were their precep·
and speak of them in the highest terms ; and if they become
att'ord the strongest evidence of the confidence they reposed
in the purity of the lives and conduct of the members of these institu·
tions, by committing their young daughters to their care and intotl·uc-
ti<'n. 'fhe conduct also of the Roman Catholic clergy in Canada
de!!erves an equally stl·ong testimony from us. We have witnessed
their courageous nnd unremitting nttention to their duties, when an
appalling pe~tilence twice swept over the land; we have seen them
as the preceptors of youth in the seminaries-we have known them
iJl.the discharge of their more limited, yet not less useful, duties as
paris!, priests, and in all these characters we are bound to say, that
their conduct has been t!Uch as to command the love of their own
6ock~, and the sincere~t respect of the Protestant inhabitants towards
the Roman Catholic clergy.'
" These general .test;imonies in favour of the Roman
Catholic clergy and religious ladies of Montreal, and in
contradiction to the sweeping accusations against them con•
~aine<l in the paper already named, produced no retraction o.r
on the part of the editor of the Pt·oteslant Vindi-
On the contrary, in a subsequent number of that
dated 4th of November, 1835, the calumnies were
and insisted upon, in the violent and bitter lan-
guage of ignorant fanaticism, on thE~ single authority of the
· unfortunate creature whose name is attached to the hook
quoted at the head of this article.
" In the mean time E"ome of the Protestant inhabitants of
bad voluntarily instituted an inquiry into the origin
the acctisatious, and the result was the perfect establish-
t of the falsehood of the statements, which have since
woven into tbe book under notice. The first piece of
evidence we shall off€r, is the affidavit of Dr. Robertson, a
hysician of long· standing, and a ju~tice of the peace. It ·
s 11ot the fin:t in chronological ;;.-der, .but it is the fil'st in

• William RobertfiOn, of Montreal, Doctor in i<ledicine, being
flWorn on the Holy EvangelistA, deposeth and saith as follo1V8 :-On
9th of November, 1834, three men came up to my house, having a
female in company with them, who, they said, wa~ observed,
noon, on the bank of the canal, near the extremity of the St. J
suburb~, acting in a manner which induced Rome people, who saw
to think that she intended to drown herself. They took her
house in the neighbourhood, where, after being there: some honr8,
interrogated as to who she wa~, &c., she Aaid she was the mn•11.u•o::•·
of Dr. Robertson. On receiving this information they brought
to my house. Being from home when they came to the door,
learning from Mrs. Hobertson that she had denied them, they co
her to the watch·house. Upon hearing thi~ !!tory, in
G. Auldjo, Esq., of this city, I went to the watch-house, to
into the affair. We fo11nd the young female, whom I have since
certained to be Maria Monl{, daughter of W. Monk, of this city,
custody. She said that although she was not my daughter, she
the child of respectable parents, in or very near Montreal, who,
some light conduct of hers (ari~ing from temporary insanity, to
11he wa8, at times, subject from her infancy), had kept her
and chained in a cellar for the last four years. Upon
no mark or appearance indicated the wearing of manacles, or
other mode of restraint. She said, on my observing this, that
mother always took care to cover the irons with softcloths, to p
them injuring the skin. From the appearance of her hands, she evi
dcntly had not been used to work. To remove her from the watch
house, where she was confined with some of the most
women of the town, taken up for inebriety and disorderly
in the streets, as she could not j!;ive a satisfactory account of
I, as a justice of the peace, sent her to jail as a vagrant.
ing morning, I went to the jail, for the purpose of asce
po~sible, who she was. After considerable persuasion, ~he nrrnn1;~1'C1
to divulge her story to the 11e\', H. Esson, one of the clergymen of
Church of Scotland, to who~e congregation she said her parentt~
longed. That gentleman did call at the jail, and ascertain who
wall. In the course of a few days she wall released, and I ·did not
her again until the month of August la~t, when Mr. Johnson,
Griflin-town, joiner, and Mr. Cooley, of the St. Ann ~uburbs,
chant, called upon me about ten o'clock at night, and after
fatory remarks, mentioned that the object of their visit was
me, as a magistrate, to institute an inquiry into some very
charges which had been made against some of the Roman
priests of the place, and the nuns of the General Hospital, by a
male who had been a nnn in that institution for four years, and
had divnlgecl the horrible secrets of that establiRhment, such
illicit and criminal intet·course between the nuns and the
stating pa!'ticulars of such depravity of conduct, on the part
penplt>, in thi~ rcf!pcct, nnd their murdering the oiJ,pring
criminal connPxions as soon as they were born, to the nn
lrom thirt)' to forty cvet y year. I instantly stated, that J did
belie\'e a word of what they told 111c. and they mu~t have h~en im
16
t~pon by some evil-disposed nnd designing person. Upon inquiry
who this n1m, their informant, was, J discovered that ehe answe1·ed
enctly tbe 1escription of Maria Monk, whom I had so much trouble
about last year, and mentioned to those individual8 my suspicion, and
-what J knew of that nnfortunat~ girl. Mr. Cooley said to Mr. John·
80n, ' Let us go home, we are hoaxed.' 'I'hey told me she was then
et Mr. Johnson's house, and requested me to call there and hear her
own story. 'l'ue next day, or the day following, I did call, and saw
.Maria Monk at Mr. Johnson's house. She repeated in my pre~ence
the subt~tance of what was mentioned to me before, relating to her
having been in the nunnery for fonr years ; having taken the black
veil; the crimes committed there; and a variety of other circum-
etances conceming the conduct of the prie~>ts aod nuns. A Mr.
· Hoyte was introduced to me, and was present during the whole of
the time that I was in the house. He was represented as one or the
persons who had come in from New York with this young woman, for
the purpose of inve5tigating into this mysterious ntfair. I was asked
to take her deposition, on her oath, as to the truth of what she had
tltated. J declined doing :;o, giving as a reason, that from my know-
ledge of her character, I considered her assertions upon oath were
not entitled to more credit than her bare assertion, and that I did
not believe either; intimating at the same time, my willingness to
take the necet~sary steps for a full investigation, if they could get any
other per8on to corroborate any part of her solemn testimony, or if
.a direct ch&rge were made against any particular individual of a cri-
minal nature. During the first interview with Messrs. Johnson and
Cooley, they mentioned that Maria Monk had teen found in New
York in a very destitute situation by r,ome charitable individuals,
.who administered to her necessities, being very sick. She exp•·e~sed
a wish to see a clergyman, ns she had a dreadful secret which she
'Wished to divulge before she died : a clergyman visiting her, she re-
to him the alleged crimes of the priests and nuns of the
Hospital at Montreal. After her recovery, she was visited
examined by the mayor and some lawyers at New York, after-
wards at Troy, in the State of Ne\V York, on tht' subject; and I un-
derstood them to say, that Mr. Hoyte and two other gentlemen, one
.of.them a lawyer, were sent to Montreal with her, for the pUI'pose of
-examining into the truth of the accusations thus made. Although
•.•.,,._.,.,..ulous as to the truth of Maria Monk's story, I thought it in-
1~umbent upon me to make some inquiry concerning it, and have
:~certained where she has been residing a great part of the time she
·.atates ha,ving been an inmate of the nunnery~ During the summer
of 1832, she was at service at William Henry ; the winters of
1832-3, she passed in this neighbourhood, at St. Ours, and St.
The accounts given of her conduct that season, corrobo-
the opinions I l1ad before entertained of her character.

" But, although Pach of these stot·ies contmdicts the
other, and all completely destroy the general ct·edibility ·
the witness, we have, further, the direct testimony of Dr:
Robertson, that during the four years in question, she was
neit.her chained in a cellar, nor outraged in a nunnery. lu
1832, she waf> at William Henry-a town about torty. five
,nilel'l below :Montreal ; and in the winter of 1832-3, she
was living in the same neighbourhood, namely, at St. Ours
or ~t. Denis, two villages lying south and inland of the town
just named. .
" We now come to the affidavit of the mother of Maria
Monk. It is of great length, and contains some minot;
details which rlo not materially strengthen the evidence~
though they would do so were that evirlence of a less decided
charactt.-'r. Many of these details we shall therefore omit,
givin~ only the mo.;t important passages.
" The affidavit was sworn to on the 24th of October~
18:35, before Dr. Robertson, whose own evidence the
•·eadPt' has just perused.
" Mrs. Monk declares in this affidavit,
' That wishing to guanl the public against the deception which
has lately been practist>d in MontrP.a! i>y designing men, who have
ta iH~ n advant<tge of the o•~ea~ ional mt~ntal de1·angement of he1·

the uuns in Montt·eul, and aftt~t·wurds to make her pass herself foa·
a .nun who had left the convent,'
" She proceed::~ to :=;tate, that in August, ] 835, a
"named HoytP, who stated himself to be a minister cJf New
YorI<, called upon her and iuformed her,-
• That he had lately come tu Montreal, with a young woman an!l
<'hild of five weeks old; that the woman had ai>sconded from him
Goodenough's taveru, where they were lodging, and left him
the child; he !,;ave mr a description of the woman ; I unfortun
discovc1·ed that the description answered my daughter, and
rellertion that this stranger had called upon Mr. Esson, om· pastor,
and ino111iring for any brother, I suspected that this was planned;

·" We now proceed to quote a further portion of Mr!C.
Monk's affida\'it.
' Early in the afternoon of the same day, Mr. Hoyte came to my
house with the same old man, wishing me to make all my ell'orts to
find the girl, in the mean time speaking w•ry bitterly <~gainst the
Catholics, the priests, and the nuns; mentioned that rny daughter
had been in the nunnery, where she had been ill-treated. I denied
that my daughter had ever been in a nunnery; that when she was
about eight years of age she went to a tlay-schuol; at that timr came
in two other persons, whom Mr. Hoyte introduced; one was the
Rev. Mr. Brewster. I do not recollect the other reverence's name.
They all requested me, in the most pressing terms, to try to make
it out my daughter had been in the nunnery; and that she had 8ome
connexion with the priests of the seminary, of which nunnery
and priests she spoke in the most outrageous tPrms ; said that
should I make that out, myself, my daughter, and l'hild, would be
protected fur life. I expected to get rid of their importunities, in
relating the melancholy circumstances by which my daughter was
· frequently deranged in her hrad, and told them that whcn ·.·tt the age
. of about seven years, she broke a slate pencil in her head; that
since that time her mental faculties were deranged, and by times
much more than at other times, but that she was far from being an
idiot; that she could make the most ridiculous but most plausible
. stories; and that as to the history that she had been in a nunnery,
it \\"as a fabrication, for she never was in a nunnery; that at one
time I wished to obtain a place in a nunnery for her; that I had
· employed the inltut>ncc of Mrs. De Montl'nach, of Dr. Nelson, and
of our pastor the Rev. Mr. Esson, but without success.'
• • • ' Aftl'r umny more solicitations to the same effect,
three of them retired, but Mr. Hoyte remained, adding to the other
solic.itatiou:;: he was stopped, a person haYing rapped at the door;
it was then eandl<!-light. I opened the door, and I found Doctor
. M'Do:wld, who told me that my daughter Maria was at his house
in the mo8l distressing situation; that she wished him to coml' and

after, Mr. Boyte came and demanded the child: I gave it to him.
Next morning Mr. Hoyte returned, ami was more pressing than in
his former solicitations, and reqursu·d me to say that my daughter
had been in the nunnery; that should I sav so it would be better
than one hundred pounds to me; that I would be protected for life,
and that I should Je:n-e Montreal, and that I would be better provided
for elsewhere; I answered that thousands of pound~ would not in-
duce me to perjure myself; then he got saucy and abusive to
utmost ; he said he came to Montreal to detect the infamy of
priests and the nuns.' ·

" But littiP now remains to IJe nddecl. Touching the

might add the testimony of sevf'ral persons now in Loudon,
who6e opportunities of ob&ervntion have been ampl<>, having
residecl ruauy year::. iu Canada, during the wholt• of whicfi
period not eveu a whi~>per was e\'er uttered against these

purity of their liv~.>s waR uuiversally acknowleclged. Living
in tire midst of a popuious city, their residences open to any

Slcmdard, edit...d as it is by 1:1ome of the most recklesll of
the calumnia!ors cf the religion of the peoplt' of Ireland, ·or
that the Times should :11ake use of any calumny, which
could escape contradiction and exposure even for a few
weeks, is easily accounted for by the habitual depravity
the editors of those papers. But that any persons of a
different station in life should be found so det.titute of all
sense of religion, as to republish known calumny-calumny,
the falsehood of which was demonstrated, might indeed
create the extreme of eurprise, if anti-Catholic bigotry bad
not fumished multitudinous instances of the total abandon-
ment of all shame-of such an utter disregard of veracity,
that Charles James Fox's expression, of ' a good Protestant
lie,' is not so familiar as to supp•·ess every angry emotion,
and to cause a smile of contempt to take the place of a more
legitimate resentment.
" \Ve cannot but appeal to all that exists of good sense
and good feeling, against the continuance of this Fystem
unprovoked and unjustifiable slander. Surely falseuv•"'-'·-
calumny-for we must use the only appropriate word-is
not the proper weapon of religious controvert~y. It
possibly make any converts to Protestantism. On the
contrary, it irritates and disgusts the Catholics, and tends
to convince them that the cause must necessarily be a
one, which sanctions and requires such vile instruments.
It is true that they may deter Protestants from giving
patient and candid attention to the merits of the contrnvor·..u ·
between them and the Catholics, which so important,
truly awful a subject demands. But this protection
Protestantism, which arises from the dark mist created
calumnious imputations, is one which no sincere
can hesitate to condemn : and there is also a reaction in
system itself. Protestants of just minds and right feelings,
when they discover bow totally false are the assertions
the advocates of their religion, are thereby rendered more
attentive to the argumentt~ of the Catholics-more disposed
to look upon Catholicity with a favourable eye, as
affording any grounds for true accusations, when calumnies
are used to supply their place; and thus, what was •nr..nt1"tt
to prevent conversion, is often and often the cause of a
jncrease to the ranks of our religion."

1 ;l lowing is nk~>n from the Edinburgh Patriot, (a
~h Proll ·tan~ journal), of the 22nd May, 1836 :- 1
" We are opponents of the Roman Catholic creed. \Vo
ehould like to hav<> n fair field for discussion with those who
m~tintain it. But that we .houlcl seek for in vnin, while
tl.o1H vvho cnll themselves t1 friends of the Protestant
.cause, give them the advantage of being persecuted, We
cannot have tht>ir Ruperiority in this respect brought more
forcibly before us, than in the re\'iew of Marin Monk's
' Black Nunnery.' That such a work should have been
·published, and forced into circulation by Protestants, is
aufficientlydegracling. The clear confutation of its false-
hoods, which we here find,-(alluding to the article in the
·Dublin Rf'view, from which we have given extract!!)-is
written with a temperance which the author of it owes, we
·fpar, to the circumstance, that those who have entered into
the 6asc and degrading com.piracy be exposes, are not
of his own creed."
.· · What will honest Protestants say afl:pr this ? What will
·they think of a Protestant minister giving extracts from such
'atrocious work weekly, for the edification of Protestants ?
·What restitution can such a man make to the violatE.>d law~
' of truth and justice ?

We trust, that all lovers of tru.u and advocates ofjustice,
who must naturally desire to avoid a breach of the prec£>pt,
that commands them NO'r to bear lalse witness against their
neighbour, will ponder on the following solPmn declarations
of the Holy Ghost, and avoid the crimes of calumny and
detraction therein condemned :-
" But if you have bitter zeAl, and there be contentions in
your ht:>arts ; glory not, and be not liars agninst the truth.
" For tl1
is is not wisdom, descending from above : but
(•arthlv, sensual, devilish.
" f'or where envying and contention is, there is incon·
stancy, and every evil work.
" But the wisdom, that is from above, first indeed is
chaste, then peaceable, modest, easy to be persuaded, con·
senting to the good, full of mercy and good fruits, witho1.1t
judging, without dissimulation.
" And the fruit of justice is sown in peace, to them that
make peace."- S'f. JAMEs, ch. iii., ver. 14 to 18.
" T Lou hatest all the workers of iniquity : thou wilt de-
titroy all that speak a lie.
" The bloody and the deceitful man the Lord will abhor.
" For there is no truth in their mouth : their heart is
vam.
'' Their throat is an open sepulchre: they dealt deceitfully
with their tongues: judge them, 0 God.
" Let them fall from their devices : according to the
multitude of their wickednee::ses cast them out: for they
have provoked thee, 0 Lord."-PsALM v., ver. 7, 10, 11.
'' Behold he hath been in labour with injustice : he hath
conceived sorrow, and brought forth iniquity.
'' He hath opened a pit and dug it: and he is fallen into
the hole he made.
" His sorrow shall be turned on his own bead : and his
ini11uity shall come down upon his crown."- PsALM vii.,
ver. l5 to 17.
