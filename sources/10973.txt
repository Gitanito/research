  		              		Experience Description   

    I felt an immense universal love and peace in me. I felt like I was on a cloud, but also in the cloud and I was the cloud. I was filled with a happiness that is not known on this earth. Then my deceased grandmother took my hand to  reassure me. Don't ask how I know it, as communication was intuitive and not verbal.  I knew that they made me come back because  my 7 year old son  had to experience an 'important' future, and it is my mission to be with him. I also needed  to 'elevate' myself spiritually for my next lives.

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  Same precision, but not the same intensity felt.  
  
  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain     A more developed 6th sense + hyperesthesia and hypersensitivity. The negative energy of others is draining me. I have to live in solitary to be happy.  
  
Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          A second chance to allow my child to grow up without to much problems.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    About 2 years and now I only choose connected people in my surroundings, who can understand me.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   Through TV, but like ufologists, I thought this was delusional. And no, it took me 2 years to realize that I had also experienced one.  

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably real     Anchored in my deeper self, almost like in the DNA... maybe to elevate even faster in my next life, and to realize everything earlier in order to advance better.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     Now when I see the similar testimonies I feel less alone. Apparently we are 60 million in the world.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         My son has a more karma than usual. This I was told by a well known magnetizer, and  even if I'm not directing him towards metaphysics but to general knowledge, I know that what I was told by the angels is true. Every day is proving it little by little. One day I will know the 'why' I'm still here. But there is something exceptional, even though I cannot yet identify his life's path.
