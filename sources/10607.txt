  		              		Experience Description   

    I had taken what I thought was LSD with a friend although our experiences were completely different.  We went into town to purchase from an unknown person.  We took it together and took the bus back to the area where we lived.  We were thrown off of the bus because my friend decided to play cowboys and Indians on the bus by fictionally shooting things up.  We decided to go to one of her friends places to visit.  He was in the navy and that was all that I knew.  We all sat around the kitchen table playing a card game called hearts.  As we were playing, the cards started doing tricks on me and all of a sudden, I couldn’t manage playing cards anymore.

  I said to the people at the table that I cannot play anymore because things were getting weird.  I went to stand up as things were closing in on me.  I remember reaching for a high chair that was close to the fridge.  I was losing consciousness.  I remember falling to the ground and the next thing I knew; I was above my body looking down at my friend and her friends talking.

  I heard them saying, 'she is dead.  I don’t feel a pulse.'  They were scared and didn’t know what to do because obviously they were scared because it was a drug overdose.  

  As they are panicking, I was saying, 'it’s ok!  I am alright.'  It’s like they couldn’t hear me so I yelled to them that I was ok.  

  While this was happening, I was ok?  I didn’t feel pain only peace.  I was trying to let them know how not to worry.

  I didn’t see any light or travel through any tunnels but I did feel at peace although I should not have given my state.

  The next thing I knew, I was back in my body.  I remember saying 'I have to get out of here.'  I was entrenched in sweat!  I ran out the front door and I have never seen those people ever again in my life.  Including my friend.

  I believe that I was panicked because I believed had I not have come back, the people that I was with would not have called an ambulance for fear of being in trouble.  That is why I ran out of the house!

Did you feel separated from your body?      No    I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal   I believe that it was the intensity of my focus towards what was happening to me from above.  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         When I was out of my body looking down at myself.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Time seemed to go faster or slower than usual     It seemed like forever trying to plead and speak to everyone while I was above my body.  It was merely a few minutes I suspect.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I could see with great clarity that my body was laying there unconscious.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      It was almost as though my only task was to hear what was happening in the moment.

Did you have a feeling of joy?         No  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       No

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Catholic   Non practicing  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I tend to live in the present now.  Like every day could be your last.  

What is your religion now?         Unaffiliated- Agnostic     

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I have heard women distantly laughing but could not see them while at a treatment centre in an old church so I believe there is something that needs explaining.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     We are only using these vessels we call bodies in order to navigate a perception for the afterlife.  Kind of like a gift.  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Moderate changes in my life       

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   Well it really sounds like something out of a science fiction novel.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  Obviously you hang on to an experience like that because it is something that you think people would think your nuts and you want to try and understand also so the events would be crystal clear.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     Already described one above at the treatment centre.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I just shared with my sister 40 years after it happened.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably not real      I believed that it was not real but could not explain it away either.  

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I had been doing some reading and I saw many similarities with others so i know that I couldn’t of possibly imagined it.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         No
