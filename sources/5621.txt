: In my laſt preface, I gave a detailed account of my aerial
journey, together with a prophetic diary for the year 1815. I
have the pleaſure of ſaying that all my prognoſtifications were
verified. I muſi confeſs, that although my chief end in thus
unveiling the arcana of futurity, was to enlighten the minds of
men at large, yet, I did hope that at the fame time I ſhould
purſuing the right path to fame and opulence. Of the former
I may ſay, without vanity, that I poſſeſs a pretty large ſhare;
fufficient to ſatisfy the deſires of any reaſonable mind; of the lat.
ter-alas! I am as poor as Job was in the days of his adverſity.
Former ages were more generous than the preſent. From them,
I received the honourable title of Knight—but now-a-days, the
number of theſe honourable men is ſo great, that I who have
laboured inceſſantly for the good of the public, am loſt in the
eneral maſs—my country neighbours, by whom I was hereto
; looked up to with a degree of reverence, begin to loſe that
feeling, as they have found out, that there is ſcarcely a village in
England, in which a knight does not reſide.--I certainly have not
wielded aſword—but I have wielded a gooſe-quill—my neighbours:
cannot diſtinguiſh the difference—and thus I fear my ancient;
dignity will be confounded with the pretenſions of thoſe, whoſe
honours are but of the growth of yeſterday. However I always
conſole myſelf with this reflection, that an impartial public will
decide between the men of war, and the man of peace. t
I have had ſome thoughts, principally on this account, of re
moving my abode altogether to the upper regions, and there in
the folitude and privacy of my jupiterian refidence, forget the
petty vexations of this tumultuous world. It ſeems a moſt pro
vidential circumſtance, that at the time when I was about to
ſuffer (what Hudibras could never endure). I mean, in my ho
mour, a ſituation ſhould have ſo wonderfully fallen to my lot,
where I can enjoy my ſolitary dignity, without the danger of
intruders. The more I revolve this projećt in my mind, the
more I am enamoured of it—but I cannot leave my real friends,

without a legacy, and this I ſhall preſent to them as the firſt
fruits of my ſpeculations in that region, where the ºthick filai
of prejudice no longer exiſts—where the faculties and powers of
the mind have room to expand themſelves—and where every
thing, even the very air itſelf, †. to elevate—refine—and
ſpiritualize the ideas of a diligent ſearcher into the economy of
nature.” Here then is the Reliquiae Sacrae—the firſt ſketch 6fra
ſyſtem which is to aſtoniſh, confound, and convert the philoſo
phers of all nations. If an apology be required for preſenting
this to the world—let me ſay that the preſent day is the period
for new ſyſtems—the rage for ſyſtem is moſt prevalent. We

I really can ſee no plauſible reaſon, why you ſhould not, and
therefore here it is, juſt as it came forth from the brain—you
have it therefore at firſt hand. - º
“When I have examined matter, (that is, the matter of this
world, I ſay nothing of the matter of ºſatellite) it has ap
eared to me that it could not think, and I have readily admitted

“When I have conſidered the animals, I have not been able
to help thinking them intelligent, and that ſo much ingenuity
was not without ſome underſtanding. They are, therefore, ſaid
I, provided, with a ſpiritual ſubſtance. But what! theſe in
fečts, theſe worms, theſe microſcopical animals, who increaſe
without number in the ſhorteſt ſpace, have they each a ſpiritual,
that is to ſay, an unchangeable, immortal ſoul ?—may ſome one

If this foułis capable of perceptions, it is ſpiritual, an º * *-
Gble, and ifitis indiviſible, it cannot, ſeparate from itſelf aſy
part to go and animate any being whatever,i.e. If this ſpirit.inf

3 * Farther: the ancients believed that man, like the animals,
derived from the univerſal ſoul all the intelligence he is endowed
with—this is a grand miſtake. If we cooſider in man, that hidden
principle which carries him ſo efficaciouſly to follow the impreſ:
fions of ſenſe, though ever ſo repugnant to reaſon, we ſhall
agree with the ancients, that this principle muſt be the ſame
which animates, rules and directs the animals; the pure ſenſi
tive nature of the univerſal ſoul is viſible in it. But when I
perceive in man another agent, which tends to ſubjećt all his
aćtions to the rules of juſtice ; which ſo often oppoſes the
fenſes (though ſeldom with ſucceſs) which, even when it ſuc
ceeds not to hinder the ſin, never fails to ging him with remorſe
and repentance; I cannot help thinking, that beſides the uni
verſal ſpirit, there is in man another principle of a ſuperior or
der; aprinciple known by the name of i. rational ſoul." It
is manifeſt by the claſhing between the paſſions and reaſon, that
ºthere are in us two contradićtory beings, which oppoſe one
another. If I may be allowed to compare things of ſo different
a nature, I ſhould ſay that every thing which partakes of the
univerſal ſoul, is like a ſponge ſoaked in the ſea, and that if
moreover the body is endued with a reaſonable ſoul, (which is
*he caſe of man) it is like the ſame ſponge ſoaked in the ſea, but
in which a drop of oil has found its way. . . . . . . . . .”
º “infine—the ancientsbelieved, that the univerſal'ſoul was
diffuſed every where ; but neither can that be. Perhaps it per
wades the terreſtrial globe, or it may be, the whole ſolar ſyſterå,
or even farther; but ſtill it is certain it has its bounds—itis God
alone that fills immenſity. - . . . .4

... “Since ſpiritual ſubſtances have no ſolidity, they are pené
trable, and take up no room. From their penetrability if fol
lows, that ſeveral ſpirits may *".in one and the ſam; ſpace,

and that a body may alſo be in the ſame place: ; Fromithsic:
taking up no room it follows, that they have neither length;:
ner breadth, inor depth; that they have no extenſion,properly
facalled. . But ſtill a ſpirit is a real being, a ſubſtance: thougho
it takes up no room, it is neceſſarily ſomewhere : and though its
has no extenſion properly ſo called, it has neceſſarily its bounds.”
So in a metaphyſical ſenſe, all ſpiritual beings may be ſaid to be!
more or leſs extended, to contain, and to be contained; and
then we may return to our compariſon of the ſponge, pene
trated by a drop of oil, and immerſed in the ſea. . . . . º. a
“On the other hand, by virtue of the laws of combination,
the reſult of the unions neceſſarily differs from the ſubſtances
that, are united; and it does not appear that the ſoul; and the
body ſhould make an exception. When the ſpirit and matter,
are united, think not the ſpirit the ſame as before—it is in ſome
meaſure materialized—think not the matter ſuch as it was be-,
fore ; it is in ſome manner ſpiritualized. From this mixture.
reſults a new being, different from pure ſpirit, though it retains.
its aqbleſt virtue ; different from brute matter, though it ſpar.
takes of its qualities. It is a particular being, forming an indi
vidual, and thinking a-part; in fine, it is ſuch a being as you that
are reading, ſuch as I that am writing. Therefore, what pers
ceives in us, is, properly ſpeaking, neither the univerſal ſpirit;
nor the rational ſoul, nor organized matter; but a compound
of all three. Juſt as when a lion roars, it is not the univerſal
ſoul, that is in a rage; it is the compound of that ſoul, and the
brain of the lion. Hence it comes that each animal forms a fe
parate, thinking individual, though all the animals thinki only.
by virtue of the one and the ſame univerſal ſoul. Let us pro
reed without loſing ſight of the faint light which guidesºus
through theſe dark paths. . . . . . . . . nº ºn
“We have ſeen that to form an animal, there needs only a
combination of the univerſal ſoul, and organized matter, and to
form a man there muſt be another union of organized matter,
wniverſal, ſoul, and rational ſoul. If the univerſal ſpirit was
wanting, ever obedient to the dićtates of the rational ſoul, we
ºf. none but virtuous and ſpotleſs men, ſuch as are no
where to be found. If the rational ſoul were wanting, abandon
ed to this inſtinét of the univerſal ſpirit which always follows
the allurements of ſenſe, we ſhould ſee none but monſters of
wice and diſorder, , , * ,

wº-The univerſal ſoul is united and ſeparated in the ſame cir.

any perſon, the motion eſſential to life, after having, totally
ceaſed, comeſto..be renewed (a thing which every phyſician.
knows to be very poſſible), and what will be the conſequence tº
The rational ſoul which departed upon the ceaſing of the vital.
motion, cannot return; but the univerſal ſoul, always preſent,
cannot fail of reuniting with the organized body ſet in motion
again. The man is dead, for his ſoul is ſeparated from his
body....He preſerves however the air of a living man; becauſe
the univerſal ſoul is reſettled in his brain, which it direčts tole
rably well. - -
: “Such to you appears a perſon perfectly recovered from
apoplećtic or lethargic fits,who is but half come to life; his ſoul
is flown; there remains only the univerſal ſpirit. Exceſs of joy,
or of grief, any ſudden oppoſition may occaſion death, and does
eccaſion it, in fact, oftener than it is imagined. Let a fit of jea
louſy or paſſion affect you to a certain degree, your ſoul, too
ſtrongly ſhocked, quits its habitation. And let your friends ſ
what they pleaſe, or ſay what you will yourſelf, you are dead,
poſitively dead. However you are not buried, the univerſal
ſoul atts your part to the deception of the whole world, and
even of yourſelf. - -
3." I ſhall now ſpeak of the figns by which the living may be
diſtinguiſhed from the dead; and doubtleſs the reader ſees
already what theſe ſigns may be. To behold 'wickedneſs with
unconcern; to be unmoved by virtue ; to mind only ſelf-in
tereſt; and without remorſe to be carried away with the torrent
of the age, are figns of death. Be aſſured, no rational ſoul in
habits ſuch abandoned machines. … i . . . . . .
. “I will conclude with opening a door to new reflections.
Suppoſe a man, like ſo many others, vegetates only, and is rel
duced to the univerſal ſoul, I demand whether the race of ſtieh
a man is not in the ſame ſtate. If ſo, I pity our poſterity. Rá.
tional ſouls were ſcarce among our forefathers; they are ſtill
more among as ; ſurely there will be none left among our off.
ſpring. All are degenerating, and we are very near the laſt
ſtage.” . . . . . . * * * * - nº tºº is it 3 if

The night was dark—the night was sold,
A winter's night in days of old; . . . . . . .
When, from the ancient Gothic hall, ... .

Sir Triſtam was a worthy knight, -, * * -
Of fame renown'd, of honour bright; ..., , ,
Proof of his courage had been made, . . . .

Before his ſhoulder felt the blade. . º
“Hubert,” he ſaid, “go bring my ſword,

He thought—and ’twas a ſerious thought,
Which late events to his mind brought,
That he might be that night a hoſt
To entertain ſome ſhiv'ring ghoſt.
The thought once lodg’d within his breaft,
He vow'd he'd take that night no reſt,
Till he had ſearch'd the caſtle round,
And all the vaults beneath the ground.
His truſty page now brought his ſword, , , ,
Whom then he bade, upon his word, -
Declare that he, although 'twas late,
Where'er he went, would follow ſtraight.
Ferth went the knight—his truſty page
Did many ſhocking fights preſage;
Spectres, and ſkulls, and bleached bones
Scatter'd around, and blood-ſtain’d ſtones.
**For he had heard old men declare, .
Fatts which had made him quake and ſtare,
How, at a certain night i th’ year,
Strange lights did in the vaults appear.
Through galleries long they took their way,
And Hubert then for once did pray, ' '.
That he might ſee the light again, -
Although he fear'd his pray'rs were vain.
At length they reach'd a vaulted room, "
In which he fear'd to meet his doom;
When the knight bade him ope a door,
Which ne'er had ſeem'd to ope before.
He pull’d—the ruſty hinge did creak,
And then was heard a horrid ſqueak;
“Save and defend us all,” he cried, º .
“From every harm that doth betide.” ‘’
“ Knave,” cried Sir Triſtam, “hold your tongue,
Or elſe thy noſe ſhall quick be wrung, H -
Think you that all the hoſts of ſaints º
Will hear your pray'rs, and vows, and plaints?”

“Go forward, fool!” the knight replied, all

His tone was reſolute—the threat: ...: * *
Increas'd poor Hubert's fear and ſweat; * *
But go he muſt—ſo on he went, º 'º
Although his breath was almoſt ſpent. … ºf
He had not many paces ſtirred, . . . . .
Before a whizzing noiſe was heard; 1 * *
And ere recover'd from this ſhock,
He on his face receiv'd a knock. . . . . .
t
“Angels and miniſters of grace defend us,” "
Cry’d Hubert, “here's the ghoſt will end us:
His ugly fift—beyond all ſize—
Has nearly knock'd out both my eyes.”
Sir Hubert now began to hope
His courage here would have full ſcope;
He long had wifb'd to meet a ghoſt,
And once, for one miſtook a poſt.
Againſt this poſt he ſpent his rage,
And broke a ſword renown'd for age;
But now he thought the time was nigh
When he ſhould conquer one, or die.
With haſty ſteps he pac'd the vault,
But ſpeedily was made to halt;
For 'gainſt the wall with force he ruſh'd,
And from his noſe a red ſtream guſh’d.
The ſtreaming blood—his courage rais'd,
He thought the ghoſt his face had graz'd;
And bidding Hubert go before,
He grop’d his way towards the door.

opening the door—and the next thing which preſented itſelf,
was an owl—this being diſturbed in the midſt of his noćturnal º
cogitations, had revenged the interruption by flying in the face
of Hubert.—Was there anything ſupernatural in this I give

“Will you have the goodneſs,” ſaid Barnaby Blank, Eſq."
to the ſhade with whom we laſt year left him converſing, “to a
explain the nature of thoſe ſingular appearances which you call
Jurfaces * , “Certainly,” replied the ſhade, “I do not won
der, in the leaſt, that they excite your curioſity. There is firſt
the ſurface of Modeſty, and this is the only thing neceſſary for
a Babylonian lady Equipped in this, they go forth to the the
atre and the ball-room; places in which it is extremely conve-5
nient to have only the ſurface of modeſty. The moſt elegantº
mode of arraying themſelves in theſe ſurfaces, forms one of the
moſt important features in their ſyſtem of Education. From
their earlieſt years, they are taught to part with the ſubſtance,"
and to be contented with the ſurface. They are told, when
and where it may be diſplayed to moſt advantage; and, by the
time they have arrived at years of diſcretion, they are perfectº
adepts in this moſt neceſſary art; and with the aid of a fan,”
are ſhielded from any unpleaſant ſenſations, which had theyº
the ſubſtance of modeſty, muſt be produced by the language, -
manners, and actions, which they coutinually hear, obſerve,
and practiſe. There is alſo the ſurface of Friendſhip, by the
means of which all Babylon ſeems to be but one family. Friend-s
ſhip is like a ſtrong band, made of very weak thread, twiſted.
together. A Babylonian is tied to no one by the band, but
he is tied to each of his fellow-citizens by a ſingle thread.
There is the ſurface of Piety—many years ago in great repute.”
It gives people a certain Gothic air, quite ridiculous in the
eyes of the baut tom. A few years, ſince it was found
only among the adherents to the old bigots, and in an order of .

men, who on account of their funètions, could not lay it aſide
how definous ſoever, they might be—although it ºº be con
feſſed that many even of this claſs did bid defiance to old pre
judices, and boldly ventured to declare that they did not poſſeſs
even the ſurface of piety. Within theſe few years it has again
been growinginto repute. * * : * * * * * * * : * : . . .
“Öne of the moſt ſtriking ſurfaces in Babylon,” continued the
ſhade, “is that of opulence. Behold in the temples, in the
aſſemblies, in the public walks, thoſe citizens ſo richly dreſſed,
thoſe women ſo adorned, thoſe children ſo,neat, ſo lively, and
who promiſe ſo fair to be one day as frivolous as their fathers:
follow them to their homes; furniture of the beſt taſte, com
modious apartments, houſes like palaces, all continue to pro
claim opulence—but ſtop there: if you go any further, you will
fee families in diſtreſs and hearts overflowing with cares.
“Again, there is the ſurface of patriotiſm—we muſt diſtinguiſh
in the condućt of the Babylonians between the theory and the
praétice. The theory turns entirely upon patriotiſm. ... Public
good, national intereſt, glory of the Babylonian name, all this is
the language of theory—the praćtice hangs ſolely upon the
hinge of private intereſt. It is very remarkable that in this re
ſpect the Babylonians have long been dupes of one another.
Too many perſons plainly perceived that Country did not much
affect them, but they heard others talk of it ſo often, and ſo
affectionately, that they verily believed there was ſtill ſuch a
thing as a patriot, although they were not ſo themſelves. . . . .
* Such is the lot of the elementary ſpirits,” continued the
ſhade. “No ſooner are they out of the probation column where.
they are purified, but they return to their uſual labours; and
to ſee where their preſence is moſt neceſſary, and where
men have moſt need of their aſſiſtance. At their coming.
out of the column they aſcend this hill. There by a mechaniſm
which required the utmoſt ſkill of the ſpirits every thing that:
paſſes in all parts of the world is ſeen and heard. Thou art
going to try the experiment thyſelf.” º -
On each ſide of the column is a large ſtair-caſe of above as
hundred ſleps which leads to the top of the hill. We went up,'
andwere ſcarcely half way when my ears were ſtruck with a diſ
agreeable humming, which increaſed as we advanced. When'
we came to a platform in which the hill ends, the firſt thing
that ſtruck my eyes was a globe of a conſiderable diameter. At
a diſtange it was a humming; nearer it was a frightful thunder
ing noiſe formed by a confuſed mixture of ſhouts ofjoy, ravings:
of deſpair, ſhrieks, complaints, ringings, murmurs, acclamäe
tions, laughter, groans, and whatever proclaims the impmoderate
ſorrow and extravagant joy of mortals. - -
44. Poor Indeed! tº 1846.
“Small imperceptible pipes, (ſaid the ſhade), come from each
point of the earth's ſurface, and end at this giobe. The infide
is organized ſo that the motion of the air which is propagated
through the imperceptible pipes, and grows weaker in time;
reſumes freſh force at the entrance into the globe and becomes
fenſible again. Hence theſe noiſes and hummings. But what
would theſe confuſed ſounds ſignify, if means were not ſound
to diſtinguiſh them Behold the image of the earth painted on
the globe; the iſlands, the continents, the oceans, which fur
round, join, and divide all. , Doſt thou not ſee Europe, that
quarter of the earth that hath done ſo much miſchief ato the
other three burning Africa, where the arts and the wants that
attend them have never penetrated but from which millions,
of human beings have been ſtolen in order to gratify the luxuries
of Europeans by cultivating their lands, and enrithing the ſoil
with their blood Afia, whoſe luxury, pafing to the European
Mations, has done ſo much good according to ſome, and ſo much
harm according to others. America, ſtill dyed with the blood
of its unhappy inhabitants, whom men of a religion that breathes
* peace and good-will,” came to convert and barbarouſly mur
der Obſerve what point of the globe thou pleaſeſt, place there
the end of this rod which I give thee, and putting the otheriend
to thy ear, thou ſhalt hear diſtinétly whatever is ſaid in the
correſponding part of the earth.” ºf Yi
Surpriſed at this prodigy, I put the end of my rod upon Ba
bylon, I applied my ear and heard what follows. *Is it not
true,” ſaid a farmer of the impoſts who was making his calcu
lations upon the people, “that in the occaſions of the ſtate,
every one ſhould contribute in proportion to his means, after a
deduction of his neceſſary expenſes - Is it not alſo true that as
very ſhort man ſpends leſs in cloaths than a very tall one * is it’
not true that,this difference of expenſe is very confiderable,
ſince there is occaſion for ſummer habits, winter habits, ſpring
habits, autumn habits, country habits, riding habits, and tº
know not how many others there ſhould be likewiſe morning
and evening habits, but the morning is not known at Babylon.
I would therefore have all his Majeſty's ſubječts meaſured and
taxed each inverſely as his ſtature . . . . Another confideration
of equal weight. A tax on bachelors, has been talked of.
Money ſhould be raiſed upon thoſe who are rich enough to be
married, and eſpecially upon thoſe who are rich enough to ven
ture, upon having children, and therefore married men ſhould
be taxed in a ratio compounded of the amount of their capita
tion, and the number of their children... I have in my pocket
book I know not how many projećts as good as theſe, and which:
I have very luckily deviſed; each man has his talents; this is

mines and it is well known how much it is tobeprized now
a-days.” 2 a -- * * ~ * - - - - -
# Ata little diſtance wasa grammarian making his obſervations.
“Three languages (ſaid he] are ſpoken at Babylon, that of the
mob; that of the petit maitre, and that of the better ſort. The
firſt ſerves to expreſs in a diſagreeable manner ſhocking things,
With all their judgment, ſome authors have written in this lan
guage, and the Babylonians, with all their niceneſs, have read
them with pleaſure. The ſecond is made up of a certain con.
texture of words without any meaning. You may talk this lan
guage a whole day together, and when you have done, it will
be found you have ſaid nothing at all. To enter into the
charaćter of the idiom, it is eſſential to talk inceſſantly without
reaſon, and as far as poſſible from common ſenſe. The third
wants a certain precifian, a certain force and certain graces; but
it is ſuſceptible of a ſingular elegance and clearneſs. It will not
perhaps be expreſſive enough of the flights of the poet, or the
tranſports of the muſician; but it expreſſes with admirable eaſe
all the ideas of him who obſerves, compares, diſcuſſes, and ſeeks
truth. Without doubt, it is the propereſt language for reaſon
ing; and moſt unhappily it is leaſt uſed for that purpoſe.”
* The end of my rod by chance fell upon an aſſembly where.
º were talking of happineſs. Each declared his opinion as
Ilows: * -
“At length (ſays one) this ſuperb colonnade is laid open; they
think of removing thoſe pitiful little houſes which darken that
grand and beautiful front; they repent of having built under
ground to adorn a place : taſte is reviving : the arts are going to
flouriſh : very ſhortly Babylon will prockaim the magnificence of
the monarch and the happineſs of the people.” . . . . . . . . . “It
is a great queſtion,” ſaid another, “whether colonnades, fine
fguares, and large cities, will make a nation happy: they muſt
be enriched. Induſtry muſt be excited, agriculture encouraged,
manufactures increaſed, and trade made to flouriſh: without
which all the reſt is nothing.” -
, “Nonſenſe!” ſaid a third, “I have ſaid it, and 1 ſay it again:
if we will be happy our manners muſt be more ſimple: the tir
cle of our wants contračted; and in a country life, we muſt:
withdraw from the vices which attend the luxuries of cities.”
“I do not know wherein conſiſts the happineſs of nations,”
ſaid a fourth, “but lithink the happineſs of individuals conſiſts.
in the health of the body, and peace of mind.” . . . . . “Aſſur-,
edly not,” ſaid another, “health cauſes no lively impreſſion;
and tranquillity is tireſome. To be happy, you muſt enjoy a
great reputation; for at every inſtant, your ear value tº

with encomiums.” . . . . . “Yes! and at every inſtant your ear
will be grated with cenſures, , becauſe ºthere is no pleaſing
body. It is my opinion; that every man ishappy in pro:
ortion to his authority and power; for one can gratify oneſelf
in the ſame proportion.” ". . . . . .”. “Yes! but then that
eagerneſs will be wanting which ſtamps a value upon things; if
all was in your power you would care for nothing. For m
part, I am of opinion that to be happy we muſt deſpiſe all
things; that is the only way to avoid aif kind of vexation and
. whatſoever.” . . . . . . . . “And I think we ſhould con
cern ourſelves with everything; by that means we ſhall partake
of every occaſion of joy.” . . . . . . . “Now I think we ſhould
be indifferent to everything; as the means of enjoying an un
changeable happineſs.” . . . . . . “I take wiſdom to be the
thing, for that alone will ſet us above all events.” . . . . . .
“And I ſay it muſt be folly; for folly creates her own happi
neſs, independently of any thing croſs or diſagreeable about
her.” . . . . . . . . “You are .# of you in the wrong. No
thing general can be aſſigned that may be produćtive of the happi.
neſs of particular perſons. So many men—ſo many minds;
this deſires one kind of happineſs, and that another: one wiſhes
for riches, another is content with neceſſaries: this would “love
and be loved; that conſiiers the paſſions as the bane of the ſoul.
Every one muſt ſtudy himſelf and follow his own inclination.”
. . . . . . . . “Not at all; and you are as much miſtaken as the
reſt. In vain do I perſuade myſelf that I ſhould be happy, if
I poſſeſſed ſuch a thing; the moment I have it, I find it inſuffi
cient; and wiſh for another. We deſire without end and never
enjoy." A certain man was continually travelling about, and
always on toot; quite tired out he ſaid, If I had a horſe I
houid be contented. He had a horſe; but the rain, the cold,
the ſun were ſtill troubleſome to him. A horſe (ſays he) is not
ſufficient; a chariot only can ſcreen me from the iriclemencies
of the air. His fortune increaſed, and a chariot was bought.
Y&hat followed exerciſe till then had kept our traveller i
health : as ſoon as that ceaſed, he grew infirm and gouty; and ,
preſently atter, it was not poſſible for him to travel either on
foot or on horſeback, or in a chariot.”
Thus my dear readers I have brought you to the end of part
the fifth of this intereſting and wonderful hiſtory, compared
with which the moſt intereſting yoyages and travels of our moſt
celebrated men are dull and inſignificant. A production which
is as remarkable for its cloſe adherence to truth and probability,
as for its fidelity in the correct delineations of nature, and in the
repreſentations, of the manners and cuſtoms of mankind -
