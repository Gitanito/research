  		              		Experience Description   

  Me and my best friend were visiting some acquaintances. It was a very hot, summer day. Suddenly, I felt dizzy and  nauseous. 

In the next moment, I found myself above my body. I felt so free and light.  I had the inner conviction that I was in the state of real life. It seemed like my life on earth was more like  role-playing. I could clearly see my environment there, which is  normally,  totally impossible for me to do without glasses. The colors were so much more intense and clear than on earth. At the moment when I looked down towards my body, I felt a strong pull. I was being  pulled back into my body.

 When I opened my eyes I felt like the weight of a huge stone was on top of me. My body seemed to crush me and it seemed much too small for me. It took days before I felt reasonably cozy in my body again.
