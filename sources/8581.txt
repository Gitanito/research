    Jody's Review of:&nbsp; Near  Death Experience In Survivors of Cardiac Arrest: A Prospective Study in the  Netherlands,  Pim  van Lommel, et al,  THE  LANCET ' Vol 358 '    December 15, 2001   ,&nbsp;   2039-45.&nbsp;   3/6/02    </span></b></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The is the largest prospective study of NDErs and published in a major British  medical journal, the Lancet.&nbsp;  The  8-year old study involved 344 consecutive cardiac arrest patients who died and  were subsequently resuscitated.&nbsp;  Of  these 344 patients, several had had repeat resuscitations.&nbsp;   The total deaths and resuscitations were 509.&nbsp;   The study was meticulously designed to measure NDEr life changes over the  8 year period, and to look at whether there were any statistically significant  differences in the areas of demographics, medical history, pharmacological and  psychological make-up.&nbsp;  Specifically,  the test addressed skeptical concerns regarding the proper use of scientific  methodology, whether the NDE was caused by brain chemistry, if and how drugs  might affect the occurrences or perceptions of NDEs, and whether fear or other  psychological factors might account for NDEs.&nbsp;       Id.     at 2039.

One  of the glaring problems in NDE research is that there is no 'one' definition  that is agreed upon by all researchers.&nbsp;  It  should be noted that the definition was changed during the study to account for  the observed data.&nbsp;  Moreover, van  Lommel admitted that this was a possible bias in the study.&nbsp;   Accordingly, an NDE is defined as:&nbsp;   

The reported memory of all    impressions during a special state of consciousness, (awareness of being dead    50%) including specific elements such as out of body experience (24%),    pleasant feelings (56%), and seeing a tunnel(31%), a light (communication with    the light 14%, described the colors 14%), deceased relatives(32%), or a life    review(13%).&nbsp;              Id.        at 2039.

  Additionally 29% talked of celestial landscapes and 8% described boundaries that  they could not go beyond.&nbsp;        Id.     at 2041.&nbsp;  Clinical death was defined  as a period of unconsciousness caused by insufficient blood supply to the brain  because of inadequate blood circulation, breathing or both.&nbsp;       Id.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This study can be cited for major NDE scientific findings,  the largest being that NDEs are not  medically explicable.     Id.     at 2039.&nbsp;  Van Lommel proved  under rigid methodology that the occurrence of the NDE was not associated with  'duration of cardiac arrest or unconsciousness, medication, or fear of death  prior to the cardiac arrest.'&nbsp;        Id.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the similarity in physiological make-up of the sample  population, one would expect that most of the 344 patients should experience an  NDE.     Id.     &nbsp; This would take into account  the skeptic argument of cerebral anoxia (dying brain cells).&nbsp;   However, that is not the case.&nbsp;  The  findings were that 18% of the 344 cardiac arrest patients had an NDE, with 12%  of the 18% reporting a 'core experience.'     Id.     &nbsp; Therefore, NDE is not  correlated with physiological causes of death.&nbsp;   However, the study did find that age might play a factor in the  occurrence of NDEs in that younger experiencers were more likely to have an NDE  and more likely to have a core experience.&nbsp;        Id.     at 2043.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  same argument pertaining to physiological make-up could be made for those in the  sample population who were psychologically afraid of death right before the  cardiac arrest.&nbsp;  However, there was  no difference between those who were afraid and reported an NDE as opposed to  those who were afraid and did not report an NDE.&nbsp;       Id.     at 2039.&nbsp;  Therefore, NDE  doesn't appear to be caused by emotional make-up such as fear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What  is most significant to me, was that it took NDErs several years to integrate the  NDE into their lives, consistent with   PMH Atwater  's observations.&nbsp;  Van Lommel called  the integration period, the length of time for the transformation to occur.&nbsp;   I would call it 'spiritual transformation.'&nbsp;   The transformation included life-changing insight, heightened intuition,  and disappearance of fear of death.&nbsp;        Id.     at 2040.&nbsp;  Contrarily, those  who did not experience and NDE were more likely to become agnostic or atheist  and still fear death.&nbsp;  The depth of  the experience, whether it was only an OBE or if it was a core experience, did  not affect depth of spiritual transformation.&nbsp;       Id.     at 2042.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Another key part of the longitudinal study was the effect of time, memory and  suppression of the NDE during the integration process.&nbsp;   The commentary in the Lancet talks of NDEs being the result of false  memories.&nbsp;  Interestingly, if this  were true, then this rationale could not explain why the study found that people  could recall their NDE exactly over the span of a 2-year and an 8-year period.&nbsp;       Id.     at 2041.&nbsp;  Moreover, the skeptic  commentary quoted memory studies of children, but lacked information on adults.&nbsp;   The cardiac arrest population consisted of adults rather than children.&nbsp;   There was a profound lack of explanation as to what constitutes false  memory, and many in the field of psychology agree that false memory is credited  with filling in small gaps in memory rather than inventing whole stories.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One  real weakness of the study from my perspective was that it used Ken Ring's NDE  scoring which rated positive feelings as an element of NDEs.&nbsp;   This does not take into account frightening NDEs.&nbsp;   Here, negative feelings should score just as high as positive feelings.&nbsp;   If anything, people would be less likely to share negative feelings and a  frightening NDE should take longer to process than positive NDEs or to integrate  due to the difficulty in wanting to revisit the NDE.&nbsp;   This would lead to a biasing in the results.&nbsp;   The occurrence of NDEs is most likely is higher than reported.&nbsp;   Id. at 2043.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although,  Van Lommel could not find any medically explicable explanation for why NDEs  occur, he did acknowledge that the neurological processes had to play a part in  the NDE, noting similarities between various other phenomena such as electrical  stimulation of the temporal lobe of the brain. &nbsp; Id.  at 2044.&nbsp;  However, he also commented  on the fragmented and randomness of the memories derived by these other  mechanisms.&nbsp;  Id.&nbsp;   Only the NDE had clear recall in a sequential order as evidenced by the  life review.&nbsp;  Van Lommel left the  door open for speculation that in order for a NDE to occur, memories and thought  processes must occur outside of the physical body ' ergo the brain is merely a  transmitter rather than a receptacle of thought and memory.
