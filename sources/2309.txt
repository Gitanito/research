LETTER I.
Dr. Woods,
Rev and Dear Sir :
The inspired motto of your recently published volume, entitled " Lectures
on Swedenborgianism" —" Prove all things ; hold fast that which is good" —offers
to me the same warrant for examining with care your own work that it
does to you for sitting in judgment on the doctrines of Swedenborg. As I
do not feel at liberty to question the sincerity and uprightness of the motives
which have prompted you in submitting to the ordeal of reason and revelation
the merits of the system which he has propounded to the world, so I would fain
hope to proceed in a manner equally accordant with the spirit to the apostolic
precept in my own probation of the True and my steadfast holding to the
Good of your production. If I have any embarrassment in entering upon the
task proposed, it arises from the sentiments of warm personal regard which
your uniform courtesy and kindness have ever compelled me to cherish towards
you —sentiments abundantly witnessed by the general tenor of your pamphlet
—and which render the office that I have entered upon like something under
taken by a son in opposition to a father. But the claims of Truth we both re
gard as paramount to those of all earthly relations, and you would justly enter
tain but a poor opinion of that professed earnestness of conviction which would
forbear, from motives of complaisance, to assume the defence of principles held
to be of the utmost importance, and which were yet called in question and ar
raigned of error. Upon this work of vindication I feel constrained to enter, how
ever hampered by the difficulty of uniting fidelity to truth with the deepest res
pect for the person of my opponent. If I should fail in either particular, it will
doubtless be owing to the preponderance of the opposite class of sentiments at
the time.
The kind allusions you are pleased to make to myself in the Preface and here
and there throughout the volume, together with the frank concession that you
have received profit from the perusal of portions of Swedenborg's writings, goes
far to disarm the severity of criticism, and this effect is still farther enhanced by
the general vein and spirit of your work. I can freely say that it is pervaded by
a prevailing tone of candor. It betrays no attempt, by an invidious array of
offensive points, to turn the system into ridicule, and make it the butt of a mere
odium theologicum. The object, as it strikes the reader, is obviously in the main
simple and sincere —to try the system by appropriate tests, and to ascertain how
far it agrees with, and how far it differs from, the truth. I think, indeed, that I

shall be able to show that in several particulars you have misapprehended, and
therefore misrepresented, the real character of his teachings, but I cheerfully ac
cord to your pamphlet a ruling honesty and fairness of purpose, and a christian
like course of discussion, which demands, and I doubt not will receive, the thanks
of all intelligent New Churchmen.
The work stands, in this respect, in marked and very honorable contrast with
a large portion of the tracts, reviews, and volumes which have emanated
from Swedenborg's opponents. Their general aim has uniformly been to ex
cite obloquy and contempt, by holding up to view such detached items and
features of the scheme as should seem to outrage all rational belief, while they
studiously avoid the consideration of the fundamental principles and laws of
being on which the whole is affirmed to rest. It seems never to have occurred
to these writers, that all the formidable objections, arising from the details of the
system, had to be encountered, in the outset of their inquiries, by every present
espouser of it, and that they were no less sensible than others to their utmost
force. But these objections were countervailed, in their minds, by the strength of
the evidence which arrayed itself in support of Swedenborg's claims, and it
seems to them no more than equitable, that their acceptance of these doctrines
shall be judged of by the reasons which have prompted it. These reasonshave been
with them all in all, and why is not the demand fair, that their adequacy or in
adequacy to sustain the credence yielded shall be pronounced upon ? Yet this
is precisely the demand which our opponents have hitherto refused to comply
with. They have been willing to deal with the conclusions, but not with the
premises. Until your work appeared, I recollect not a single instance, with the
-exception perhaps of Priestley, where there was even an approximation to the
show of controversial justice in the mode, of conducting the argument in regard to
Swedenborg's title to be received as a messenger from heaven. Your own
work I do regard as an approximation to this point, though falling short of it in
a variety of particulars, which I propose to designate in the sequel. The same
remark, though in a still more qualified sense, I feel bound to make in respect to
Dr. Pond's " Swedenborgianism Reviewed." Neither in your work nor in his do
I recognize a disposition to do injustice to Swedenborg by a gross caricaturing
of his doctrines, or by a substitution of coarse abuse for grave reasoning. They
both bear evidence of having been penned by men, who were seriously persuad
ed that the system in question involved errors of a momentous character, and
such as called for argumentative refutation. I do not of course admit that
either of these works has succeeded in establishing the positions upon which it
has labored. I do not regard them as having solidly convicted the system of
a single error on the score of philosophy or theology, or as having made good a
single objection urged against it ; but I nevertheless concede to both a laudable
freedom from the traits, which have almost invariably characterised every for
mer attempt to bring discredit and reproach upon the doctrines embraced by
the New Jerusalem Church. These volumes may therefore be regarded as in
dicative of the dawn of a better day in the conduct of the controversy bearing
upon the doctrines and developments announced to the world by the Swedish
aavan. The bare fact that individuals like yourself and Dr. Pond —occupying
high posts in the theological world,—seated, as it were, in the very Mizpehs, or
places of espial, in the territory of dogmatic research —should have seen fit, almost

simultaneously, to enter into the debate, will be of itself sufficient henceforward
to redeem the system opposed from the charge of absurdity and extravagance
which has hitherto rested upon it. For who can suppose that two such " grave
and reverend seniors" should have girded themselves to the conflict unless they
deemed the enemy worthy their prowess ? Would they have appeared on the
arena if they had regarded the doctrines advanced as a mere mass of idle visions
and dreams, sustained by no show of solid reasons, and calculated to work no
conviction except in minds which had lost their balance and become the easy
dupes of wild delusions ? The question will very naturally occur, whether it
could have been anticipated of either of these gentlemen, that they should, for
instance, have assumed the attitude of public opponents of the vagaries of Mor-
monism ? Would they not have deemed them beneath the notice of their pens ?
Would they have been willing to confer upon them even the eclat of their dis
sent ? Whatever then may be the estimate of the christian community at large
of the character of these doctrines, it is clear that neither yourself nor your theo
logical compeer regard them as at all upon a par with the ordinary class of re
ligious hallucinations.
But this is not all. Your calm and logical course of procedure —your candid
consideration of the arguments adduced —your careful abstinence from any de
signed invidious exhibition of the tenets of Swedenborg —your studious suppres
sion of all incendiary or disparaging epithets —your evident aim to do no injus
tice to the views remarked upon —in all this your example (and I speak of both)
goes to administer an emphatic rebuke to all other modes of carrying on the
warfare against the creed of the New Church. You have established a prece
dent which I trust will be followed. You have virtually said, "These are men
to be argued with, and not to be put down by vilification and ridicule. They
justly claim to be convinced, and not merely denounced as having yielded their faith
to crazy conceits and blasphemous outrages upon the Holy Oracles. They pro
fess to assign adequate and rational grounds for their belief, and they are to be
dealt with accordingly." For the altered complexion which your influence is
thus likely to give to all future controversy on this score, I am for one profoundly
grateful. Its effect, I am quite sure, will not be lost upon us in the maintenance
of our positions.
In approaching the consideration of your work, I find myself drawn in the
outset to several remarks occurring in the Preface, containing what you would
have to be regarded as a solution of the fact, that matter of real excellence occa
sionally stands out in Swedenborg's writings in marked contrast with the staple
of the dreams. After alluding in courteous terms to my private communications,
you say :—
" I can assure my brother, that I have attended to the works of his favorite
author with a sincere desire to profit. And I think that I have profited. Some
important truths, which I have long believed, particularly in regard to the in
ward motives of human action, the disclosure which will be made of the secrets
of the heart in another world, and the correspondence of future retributions with
the predominant characters of men, have, by these writings, been impressed on
my thoughts with new vividness and force. In some cases his visionary repre
sentations of important practical truths are very striking and happy. In his
work on Providence he advances many just and scriptural views. This and
some other of his works seem to contain his own speculations, and I think must
have been composed mostly during the intervals, (as there evidently were in
tervals), between his visionary states, when he thought and wrote from his own

mind, and not from the dictation or influx of angels, whether good or bad. In
the works referred to, we do not find him saying continually, that the angels told
him so and so. And I cannot but deem it a special advantage to him, that he
was thus occasionally left to think in his own way, and to draw his theories
and arguments from his own resources."
That the disclosures to which you refer cannot well be read without yielding
to every candid mind the " profit" which you acknowledge yourself to have de
rived from them, I can easily understand. But how it can be conceived possible
that such a searching analysis of human motives —such a keen anatomising of
the heart—such a terrible cautery of conscience —such an impressive display of
retribution —could have proceeded from any one who was not an actual eye and
ear witness of the realities of the world of inner unveiling, I cannot understand.
With me they receive all their force from the evidence afforded that he is, in these
statements, dispensing the results of experience, and not of mere speculation,
whether sane or insane. If these alleged disclosures really possess the moral
efficacy which you attribute to them, it must be from their accordance with
what you are otherwise assured to be the substantial truth, and it would certainly
seem reasonable, that the acknowledged intrinsic truth involved in his statements
should abate.somewhat of the presumption of their being the mere product of
dreaming phantasy. Something, at any rate, seems due to the consideration,
that a mere dreamer would be quite as apt to dream falsity as truth.
But from this dilemma you would obviously extricate your concession by the
assumption that follows—and assumption it undoubtedly is, for there is nothing
in the recorded biography of Swedenborg to warrant
it.
We look in vain for
the least hint or intimation of such " lucid intervals" as you suppose " between
his visionary states
;"
during which he gave out his own speculations as distin
guished from his extatic disclosures. He claims for all the writings published
by himself subsequent to his illumination precisely the same degree of authority,
and
it
is
utterly at variance with everything known of the integrity of his charac
ter to suppose, that he would have given us no criterion by which to discrim
inate between what " he thought and wrote from his own mind" and what he
received " from the dictation or influx of angels." In
a
letter to
a
friend pub
lished by Mr. Hartley, and giving the leading particulars of his life, he says,

above-mentioned,

I
have been called to
a

gift of conversing with spirits and angels, which has been continued to me to this day.

period it was that those very works were written, of which you speak with
commendation and by portions of which you declare yourself to have been
"profited." In this then you were reaping the fruits of that very illumination
from which you would fain withhold the due credit. He elsewhere very
frequently alludes to the continued enjoyment of his supernatural state through a
long course of years, and never once hints at the interruption or suspension of
it for any interval, whether long or short. You remark indeed, —and this seems
to be the source of your impression —that "in the works referred to, we do not
find him saying continually, that the angels told him so and so." Very true ;
but what does he himself declare on this head? "With the angels I have
conversed these twenty-two years past, and daily continue so to do ; with them
the Lord has given me association ; though there was no occasion to mention all this
in my writings. Who would have believed, and who would not have said,
show some token, that I may believe ?—and this every one would have said who
did not see the like."
Permit me then to ask upon what grounds you feel authorized to assert the
fact of such a distinction as you have pointed at between the different portions
of Swedenborg's writings, as if one were the production of his own mind, in
its normal condition, and another the result of alleged angelic dictation? It
certainly rests upon no admission of his own, nor does it receive countenance
from any other authentic source, and the opinion would seem to have been
adopted solely with a view to meet an exigency. A problem was to be
solved respecting what Swedenborg says of controversial debates among the
spirits of the other world. " It is remarkable, that all his works, whether
prompted by his own mind (?), or by the spirits of dead men, contain a great
abundance of controversial matter. It is, however, obvious that, in this
respect, his account of the heavenly world, though it indirectly resulted from
his own habit of thinking (?), is not according to the word of God. For who
would ever learn from the Scriptures, that there is any occasion for controversy,
or any want of union, in heaven ?
"
To say nothing of the mistake of making
heaven, instead of the world of spirits, the scene of these debates among spirits,
here is a.foregone conclusion, with which the admission of Swedenborg's truth on
this head is wholly inconsistent. His state therefore at the time was not one of
truthfulness, but a state of phantasy. "When a man who has been accustomed
to controversy, has a dream or vision of the world of spirits, it is no wonder if
he finds things there, much as they are here." You are of course at liberty, if
you find no better solution, to explain Swedenborg's statements of the facts of
the other life on the hypothesis, that the whole of them are the offspring of dreams
and delusions, both the true and the false, but I must certainly protest against
a gratuitous assumption in the outset, with a view to separate these different
elements, and then reasoning on this assumption so as to save the credit of one
part of his statements at the expense of another. The evidence is decisive that
all the utterances emanated from precisely the same psychological state, and for
the same reasons that we ascribe truth to one part of them, we ascribe it to the
others also. The whole matter reverts therefore to the question, first, of the
fact of such a state as Swedenborg claims for himself, and, secondly of the
necessary truthfulness of that state arising from its supernatural character. In
other words, the question has to be determined, whether such a state as he

by the direct divine agency, and whether, conceding this, he would at the same
time have been allowed in that state to give forth to the world a mixed medley
of truth and falsehood. This you will perceive to be a question of very grave
import, and one upon which 1 trust some light will be thrown as we proceed.
For the present I remain,
Dear Sir,
Very respectfully Yours,
GEO. BUSH.
LETTER II.
Rev. and Dear Sir :
After intimating in your preface that you shall peremptorily decline any reply
to whatever animadversions may be made upon your work, you hand over the
task of continuing the controversy, if it shall be kept up, in the following words :
" I must therefore commit the subject to the care of brethren who are younger
than I, and to the disposal of an all- wise Providence; and will only whisper to
the zealous advocates of Swedenborgianism, that their expectations of success
will be very likely to be disappointed. The system has indeed some powerful
attractions to a certain class of men. But its errors and corruptions are so
palpable and gross, as to divest it entirely of the authority which it claims, and
to prevent its prevalence among the great body of sober-minded Christians." —
p. 4.
The " whisper" here so kindly administered to the " zealous advocates of Swe
denborgianism" might as well have been a voice uttered in the tones of a trumpet,
for any special or oracular significancy which they will be disposed to attach
to it. The probability of their success in the propagation of their peculiar
views will depend, they believe, entirely upon their accordance with the
abstract truth, as embodied in the Divine Word, and echoed in the universal
reason of man. Their hopes on this score are measured entirely by their confi
dence in the accomplishment of the Divine purposes, in regard to the final
prevalence of the genuine doctrines of Christianity over the earth. Cheering
anticipations on this head do undoubtedly hold the ascendancy in their minds,
yet they are moderated by so deep a consciousness of the many adverse
'influences with which the truth has to contend, that they are probably as far
as any class of men can well be from cherishing expectations, that will be likely
to receive a shock from disappointment. The very genius of the system forbids
the prospect, in the main, of any other than a very gradual triumph over the
obstacles which oppose its progress, and its espousers have only to revert to
their own individual experience — to the long struggle —the alternations of doubt
and assurance —the antagonist pieadings of self-interest, even when conviction
had won the day—to be aware of the infinite lets and hindrances with which a
code of life and truth so sublimated, so intellectual, so spiritual, so heavenly,
will inevitably meet. Nevertheless, as I remarked, the confidence of hope pre
dominates, because they consider the bestowment of the revelations a virtual
pledge for their ultimate wide reception, and they consequently regard all such
whispered vaticinations as the above as little else than a mere gratuitous begging
the question as to the intrinsic verity of the principles and doctrines involved.
If the system be of man, it cannot eventually succeed ; if it be of God, it cannot

-but succeed. The true issue therefore is the true character of the system, and by
the verdict of the Divine Providence on this head I presume you and I are both
willing to abide, and we can mutually agree to hold our prophecies in abeyance
Sill that is pronounced.
As I have already made my grateful acknowledgment for various personal
-courtesies interspersed through your volume, it will be unnecessary to repeat
them in every instance in which I feel constrained to advert to such references.
Nor do I advert to them with a view to make the personality prominent. It is
-solely with the design of remarking upon something of more importance, as for
instance in the passage which follows ,—
" It would have been gratifying to me and to many others, if Professor Bush had
-come forward with the express design to carry into effect the above mentioned
precept of the Apostle in reference to Swedenborg's writings, and to distinguish
between the true and the false, the good and the bad, the Scriptural and the anti-
scriptural. As I considered him to be sound in the faith, and settled in the in
telligent belief of the great doctrines of the gospel as commonly understood by
-evangelical ministers and churches ; I should have thought him well qualified
for such an undertaking. But the work he has entered upon is of a different
kind. His object is not to discriminate between the true and the false in his
favorite author, but to recommend his writings without distinction, and to de
fend the system contained in them, with all its peculiarities, against all ex
ceptions. He has given no intimation that he regards Swedenborg as chargea
ble with any mistake, or liable to any. On the contrary, it is implied in what he
has published, that he has full confidence in the claims of that writer to a divine
-commission, and in the divine authority of all his teachings, fa this matter, I
find myself in a very different state of mind from my brother." —p. 10.
The precept of the Apostle to which yen refer, as one that you and others
would have been gratified to see me come forward with the design of carrying
into effect, is that which stands at the head of your Lectures —" Prove all things;
hold fast that which is good," and the implication is, that I could not consist
ently act upon the spirit of this precept in reference to Swedenborg's writings
without " distinguishing between the true and the false, the good and the bad,
the scriptural and the anti-scriptaral," that might be found in them. In reply to
this allow me to say, that as the whole body of these writings came before me
with precisely the same claim on the score of truth and authority, I felt myself
feound in justice to examine the foundations of that claim as to the entire ground
covered by
it,
and not as to its separate departments. The system announced,
I
perceived to rest upon certain great principles, mainly psychological, and that
by the truth or falsity of these principles, the whole superstructure built upon
them must stand or fall. Swedenborg does not present himself to the world as
a man giving out his own peculiar views —the product of his own unaided spec
ulations —like an ordinary theologian, some of which might be expected to be
sound and some unsound, but he comes professedly clothed with an entirely dif
ferent character —that of a chosen and commissioned messenger from God, em
powered, by special divine illumination, to lay open the mysteries of the spirit
ual world, and to unfeld the genuine doctrines of the inspired Word. Whether
true or false, this
is
his claim, and this claim, in its entire purport,

did not at all occur to me that

was to begin, from the

the principle distinctly recognized by yourself, (p. 20), " If his claims are founded
in truth, all his revelations are, in the highest sense, from God."
It was very obvious, that considering his claim of truth throughout, any pal
pable errors would of course practically nullify all the positive truths with which
they might be mixed up. Who would regard the truth when corrupted by such
base alloys of falsity ? You have yourself distinctly adverted to this perverse
tendency in the human mind to undervalue truth when found in close connection
with error.
" Truth," you say, " is indeed truth, wherever it is found. But mixing
error with it is likely to prevent its good influence on the mind, and in many
ways to lead on to pernicious consequences." You are right therefore in saying
that my object is not any such discrimination as you spake of, but to recom
mend Swedenborg's writings without distinction, for I know not where to draw
the line that shall separate between the true and the false. If you can enlighten
me on this head by clearly defining the principles on which such a discrimina
tion is to be made, I will readily confess to the defectiveness of my procedure.
But permit me to say that it will not be sufficient for this purpose merely to
point out certain features of his disclosures which are intuitively seen to be true
and which involve truths that have uniformly been admitted as such by good
men of all ages of the Church. This doubtless may be very easily done. But
the credit given to Swedenborg on this score is a vastly inadequate response to
the extent of his claim. These self-evident truths, as you might term them, are
found in him in such connections —built upon such principles —bearing such re
lations to the nature of God and the nature of man—and drawing after them such
inevitable results —that they assume an entirely new phasis and can scarcely be
recognized as the same truths with which we were before familiar. You remark
upon this head, that ;—
" There are many doctrines contained in Swedenborg's writings, which we
believe, because they are agreeable to reason and Scripture. We are not in
debted to him for the knowledge of these doctrines, though we may be under
obligations to him for presenting some of them before us in a clear and striking
manner. For example, we have believed, without any reference to his writings,
that the mind or spirit is essentially the man. We have believed that man con
tinues to exist after the death of the body, a real and true man, in the full pos
session of the power of perceiving and knowing, loving and hating, enjoying
and suffering. And we have believed that he has all his mental powers and
faculties, as a rational and moral being, in a higher degree of activity and per
fection after death, than before. We have believed that the spirits of men in
another world, even before the resurrection of the body, are not only capable
of intercourse with the infinite Spirit, but of communicating their thoughts and
feelings to one another, and that far more perfectly than was ever done by
means of bodily organs in the present life. We have believed that the state of
man in the other world will be according to the predominant affection which he
exercised and the habits he formed on earth ; and that an unsanctified man is-
incapable of holy pleasures, and could not be happy in heaven, even if lie were
permitted to dwell there. We have believed in the existence and agency of good
and evil angels ; and we have believed that they have a real influence in and
upon the minds of men, the good angels, a salutary influence, and wicked angels,
a hurtful influence, though we have not always called it an " influx." We have
believed that the Lord Jesus, being truly God, is the proper object of supreme
worship, and that according to the example of the Apostles and primitive Chris
tians, our prayers are to be addressed to him, as really as to the Father. We.-
have believed that friends and acquaintances will fully recognize each other and
be associated together in the world of spirits ; that all the holy, whether they die
older or younger, will in some way suited to their condition, have the means o£

improvement, and will make rapid advances in intellectual and moral excellence,
and in heavenly enjoyment. We have believed that intelligent, moral beings are
spread, in vast numbers, over the whole material creation, and have employ
ments and pleasures suited to their nature and condition ; though we have
never had the means of knowing whether the distinction of sexes and the insti
tution of marriage everywhere prevails.
These and other doctrines we have believed on the ground of evidence arising
from reason, conscience, and revelation. And this belief has preceded our ac
quaintance with the writings of Swedenborg, and has been wholly independent
of them ; and yet these doctrines are taught by him, in this way, with more or
less clearness, and with a mixture of his own fancies, and, in some instances,
illustrated very happily. But my present object is not to dwell upon the truths
which Swedenborg taught, but to point out his errors. And however great the
number of truths found in his writings, all the doctrines of his which are not
manifestly agreeable to reason and Scripture, must be regarded as errors." —
p. 116.
These concessions, I confess, are larger and freer than I should have antici
pated from one who takes so many exceptions to what Swedenborg has advan
ced upon the same topics ; and even now I ask myself, with some incredulity,
whether such a belief as you indicate on these points as your own, is really
cherished, to any considerable extent, among the mass of christians in our land.
I doubt exceedingly whether any accredited formula of doctrine acknowledged
by any of the Evangelical denominations among us will be found to sanction the
explicit declaration made above, that " man continues to exist after the death of
the body, a real and true man," by which must be fairly understood, in the pos
session of all the powers and faculties which go to constitute his true and essen
tial humanity. Now I had previously supposed that the current belief among
Christians was, that man is very far from being "a true and real man" immediately
after death—that, on the contrary, the resurrection of the body is deemed
essential to the integrity of his nature in the other life— that, though he may be
said to live in the interval between death and the resurrection, yet he lives a very
imperfect kind of life, the soul ever longing and pining for reunion with the
destined body. Indeed there are those in the theological ranks who do not
scruple to maintain, that man, as man, is not complete, but in the union of soul
and body (the spiritual body), and though I do not charge this view upon any
who do not hold
it,
yet
I
think
I
cannot be mistaken in saying, that the prevalent
opinions in regard to the disembodied spirit are, to the last degree, indeterminate
and vague —that while they ascribe to
it
conscious enjoyment or suffering, they
still do not conceive
it
under any definite conditions of form, or as anything
more than a mere thinking and feeling principle.
I
have yet to learn that
Swedenborg has misrepresented the popular impression on this head when he
says
:
—"
It
was further remarked, that the learned are entirely in this belief, that
the soul, which
is
to live after death, or the spirit,
is
an abstracted thinking prin
ciple

which belief appears plainly from this circumstance, that they are un
willing to admit any expression which has reference to what
is

applicable to the soul, by reason that
a

is
not extended, but the subject of the thinking principle, and the objects
of
it,
are extended
;
and such objects as are not extended, men limit by terms, and
make them extended, in order that they may apprehend them
;
hence
it
plainly
appears, that the learned have no idea of the soul, or spirit, but as of a thinking
principle

have all the grand constituents of humanity, and if so what need of the restora
tion of the buried body, especially as that body must be raised spiritual in order
to be fitted to the conditions of a spiritual existence ? But what does such a body
add to the endowments already possessed by the spirit ? It cannot be necessary
to the functions of sensitive or perceptive life, for you say " it is in the full pos
session of the power of perceiving." If then it is to receive no reinforcement of
its powers on this score, what purpose is it to answer in the more integral
economy of the future being ? Why should Omnipotence be lavish in its gifts ?
You may say, indeed, that the divine declaration of the fact is a sufficient answer
to all such queries, and that interrogation may be carried to the point of impiety.
This, I admit, is a very effectual silencing of all argument, but still it does not
satisfy; because God has himself so constituted the human mind that it cannot
blink the cui bono of a purpose which strikes it as inconsistent with something
else equally plain. I trust I am not void of a becoming reverence for every divine
dictum clearly made out, but I certainly have no fear of bringing every such
alleged enunciation into the closest contact with what I am compelled, by
the constitution of my nature, to recognize as the truth of things, which is just
as imperative on my belief as the sense of words. Now as I am not only taught
by Swedenborg, but instructed by my own inductions, that I am to take with
me a spiritual body into the other world, in every way adequate to the exigen
cies of that state of being, I am utterly at a loss to conceive the use of still
another spiritual body superadded to the former, and therefore I have no scruple
in adopting the conclusion, that such cannot be the true-meant design of the
language that seems to imply it. In other words, it is impossible that I can be
any more certain, from lexical or exegetical grounds, that such is the meaning,
than I am, from rational grounds, that it isnot the meaning. Such is the posture,
and, as I conceive, the necessary and inevitable posture, of my mind in view of
the premises. And how am I to be answered ? You tell me that such and such
is the plain sense of the Word—and the Word is dictated by God himself —and
that it is not for us to take liberties with its obvious import. But I reply —the
intuitions of my calm reason are as much from God as the written Word. Has
He established a conflicting testimony ? By which am I to be governed ? Do
you say, my reason is a very erring guide ; that I cannot safely follow it when
it leads counter to the plain letter of scripture and that other men's reason
comes to no such results ? This is very possible. Nevertheless, my reason is
mine, and God gave it to me, and I am sure that I do violence to his own prompt
ings within me when I forego its dictates. I feel too that I am bound to exer
cise my reason on the revelation he has imparted, as well as upon any and
everything else in which I am concerned, and I am to do this under a solemn
sense of responsibility to Him as one " that must give account." I ask then what
I am to do when the clear decision of my reason is against the literal sense of
his Word ? My conviction is firm, that I should positively sin against God by
postponing the authority of the intuitions which grow out of the very structure
of my mind, to that of the purport of terms which, in the nature of the case,
must be determined by my apprehensions of the intrinsic truth.
I am quite well aware that I am here touching, not only upon a nice point of
metaphysics, but of casuistry also. The tenor of my remarks brings me upon
precisely that ground on which, if any where, a judgment is to be pronounced

on the moral character of religious opinions. The verdict of heresy is frequently
pronounced on the basis of a scriptural interpretation differing from that given
by the condemning party. What is the real authority or validity attaching to
such a sentence ? How is error to be ascertained but by a reference to some
common standard of truth? Who is in possession of that standard, and how is
he to make good the evidence of his claim ? The church of the Papacy has
indeed a summary way of deciding all issues of this kind. The only appeal
is to the oracular voice of the church itself. But as you and I, and Protestants
generally, hold to the right of private judgment, the question again comes up
as to the grounds on which one body of christians is authorized to impeach
another of heresy. It is certainly no more than charity to suppose that each one
is sincere in its convictions, and that it has acted upon the clearest light of rea
son in determining the genuine import of the Word, the acknowledged source
of all doctrines. Are you or your Church authorized to sit in judgment on their
decisions ? If so, by what title ? They have exercised their deepest and coolest
reason upon the verities propounded to their faith. You have done no less —no
more. But the conclusions reached are widely at variance. Which party then
is warranted to assert to itself the claim of truth, and to denounce upon the other
the charge of error, and upon what grounds ! The charge can be of no moral
efficacy except so far as it fastens itself upon the interior rational convictions of
the soul. But here the field is preoccupied by a directly opposite class of con
victions equally legitimately attained. In the forum of conscience, then, to
what amounts the sentence of " heretical pravity ?" What weight has the judg
ment of man unless it is felt, in the mind's deepest recesses, to echo the judg
ment of God ?
But it is said that heresy endangers salvation —that those who are in a state
of salvation have a certain instinctive perception of truth which cannot pertain
to those who are out of it—and this truth they are entitled to declare by virtue
of their conscious possession of it. But here is a new element introduced into the
debate. We now pass out of the region of the intellectual into that of the moral —
from the domain of Truth to that of Good —and here the receivers of Sweden-
borg find themselves at home. The question then arises, how far error of judg
ment may consist with goodness of heart—to what extent one may be in Good
while at the same time he is not in Truth. But who shall determine this ? It is
clearly beyond the province of human power. It is impossible to pronounce
upon opinion, as saving or damning, except upon the simple ground of Char
acter. Life is the only criterion of Doctrine, and of Life we can only judge by the
external practical indications.* The final arbitrament must be left to the Omni-
* " Truths considered in themselves do not give life, but goods ; truths are only the
recipients of life, that is, of good ; wherefore no one can ever say that he may be saved
by truths, or, as it is commonly expressed, by faith alone, unless there be good in the
truths which are of faith ; the good therein must be the good of charity, hence faith
itself, in an internal sense, is nothing else than charity. As to saying that an acknow
ledgement of truth is the faith which saves, it is to be known, that with those who live
in things contrary to charity, no such acknowledgement can exist, but only a kind of
persuasion, to which is adjoined the life of self-love, or of the love of the world ; conse
quently in this acknowledgement there is not the life of faith, which is of charity." —

cieut Awarder. We are bound to recognize as Christians, and as in the way
to be saved, all those whose lives do not belie their profession. We have no
warrant to erect any other standard. The tree is to be known by its fruits.
The only fatal heresy is a depraved love and a corresponding life. I do not deny
but that it is practicable to characterize correctly certain opinions as false, but I do
deny that it is competent for any man, or any body of men, to impeach of dan
gerous heresy a system of doctrinal belief the espousers of which are, in the
eye of charity, in the good of life.*
I admit that I have lapsed into somewhat of a digression in the foregoing
train of remark. But I wished to bestow some consideration on a theme which
usually receives very little —viz. the moral estimate which is to be formed of the
errors of Swedenborg's doctrines and the practical bearing which their adoption
is likely to have on the salvation or perdition of its disciples. I speak in plain
language on this haad, because this, after all, is the great issue. It is here that
the opponents of the system find their warrant for aiming to counteract its prev
alence. They are primarily prompted to this by a serious conviction that the
errors it embodies peril the salvation of the soul, and I wish to evince that on this
very point there are principles involved, which require investigation as truly as
the abstract character of the doctrines. Yet they are principles that are very sel
dom adverted to in this controversy, or in fact in any other. Where do we find
any explicit statement of the grounds on which the sentence of fatal tendency in
doctrinal sentiments is pronounced ? Yet what more imperiously demands
it,
in
order to justify the earnest repobation, and often fierce persecution, with which
those sentiments are assailed
?
To myself the following remarks of Sweden-
borg are very impressive. " They who are gifted with goods, from a celes
tial origin, that is, with celestial goods, and spiritual goods, are also gifted with
eternal salvation, that is, are saved. That none may remain in ignorance, how
it
is
with the salvation of men after their decease,
it
is
to be stated in a few
words. There are many who say, that man
is
saved by faith, or as they express
it,
if
he only have faith, but amongst these the greatest part do not know what
faith
is
;
some suppose
it
is
mere thought
;
some that
it
is
an acknowledgment
of something to be believed
;
others that
it
is
the whole doctrine of faith which
is
to be believed
;
others again otherwise
;
thus they err in the bare knowledge
altogether contrary to all the truths of faith.
It
is
not possible for those to receive the
life of charity in another life, who have not received it, in some degree, in the life of
the body, for the life they had formed in the world remains after death, and therefore
they can then arise to and have the life of charity."—A. C. 2049.

solely from doctrinals, and would never have had place, if they had made love to
the Lord, and charity towards the neighbor, the principal point of faith. Doctrinals
would then be only varieties of opinion concerning the mysteries of faith, which true
Christians would leave to every one according to his conscience, and would say from the
heart, that he
is
a true Christian who lives as a Christian, or as the Lord teaches. Thus
one church would be formed out of all these diverse ones, and all disagreements arising
from mere doctrinals would vanish, yea, all the animosities of one against another
would be dissipated in a moment, and the kingdom of the Lord would be established
on earth."—A. C. 1799.

of what faith is, consequently in the knowledge of what that is, by which man
is saved. But still it is not mere thought, neither is it an acknowledgment of
what is to be believed, nor a knowledge of all things pertaining to the doctrine
of faith: by these things no one can be saved, inasmuch as they can take root
no deeper than in the thought, and the thought does not save any one, but it is
the life, which man has procured for himself in the world by the knowledges of
faith; this life remains, whereas all thought, which does not accord with his life,
perishes, even so that it becomes null ; heavenly consociations are according to
the kinds of life, and never according to the kinds of thought which are not of the
life ; the thoughts which are not of the life are hypocritical, and such are alto
gether rejected. In general, life is of two kinds, one infernal, the other celestial ;
infernal life is contracted from all those ends, thoughts, and works which flow
from self-love, consequently from hatred against our neighbor; celestial life is
contracted from all those ends, thoughts, and works, which are of love towards
our neighbor ; this latter is the life, to which all those things called faith have res
pect, and it is procured by all things appertaining to faith. Hence it may ap
pear what faith is, viz. that it is charity, for all things which are called the doc
trines of faith lead to charity ; they are all contained in charity, and they are all
derived from charity. The soul after the life of the body is such as its love is." —
A. C. 2228.
But to return to the subject of your concessions. You intimate that the mass
of Christians believe in the doctrine of angelic existence and agency —that Jesus
Christ is truly God— that he is the proper object of supreme worship —that
prayer is as really to be addressed to him as to the Father —and that friends and
acquaintances will recognize and be associated with each other in the world of
spirits. For these items of belief you say the world is not indebted to Sweden-
borg, and the argument is, that no special claim can be set up in behalf of his
revelations on these heads, inasmuch as all that can be recognized in them as
true, was well known and generally received before he lived or taught.
I reply to this, that on every one of these points Swedenborg's teachings are
so immensely diverse from all that had ever before been held concerning them —
they are mixed up with so many new elements—referred to so many new princi
ples—and presented in so many new phases —that they become, to all intents and
purposes, new truths. I must say, therefore, that there is an intrinsic unfairness,
however undesigned, in withholding from him the credit of novelty in this part
of his disclosures. He has taught in them what no man ever taught before.
Nor can these truths properly be said to be believed, according to his presenta
tion of them, unless the belief embraces all he has said in respect to them. Con
sequently it is unjust to intimate that he has made no advances upon our former
knowledge in any of the above departments, when those very truths are so ex
hibited by him that they virtually cease to be the old truths, with which Chris
tians have been always familiar.
Take, for instance, the admitted doctrine of Christ's divinity. " We have be
lieved that the Lord Jesus, being truly God, is the proper object of supreme wor
ship, and that, according to the example of the Apostles and the primitive Chris
tians, our prayers are to be as really addressed to him, as to the Father." If

such Being in the universe. If prayer is to be addressed to Him, in his charao
ter of supreme Deity, then what is termed " the Lord's Prayer" is to be addressed?
to him in that character, as well as any other. Do- you believe this ? Does the
mass of the christian world believe it ? Would they not inwardly shudder at
the idea of thus seeming to confound the person of the Father with that of the
Son ? Can they be brought for one moment, to admit that there is- any sound
sense in which the term Father is to be applied to the Son ? Is not the popular
apprehension of the distinction of three Divine Persons at utter variance with such
a view ? Do not their thoughts, in the offering up of this prayer, penetrate be
yond the person of the Son and fix upon that of the Father ? And do they not
prefer this prayer to the first person of the Trinity in the name and for the sake of
the second ? You will scarcely refuse to admit that this is the case. Now it
would be gratuitous to inform you, that this is directly contrary to the teaching
of Swedenborg and to the belief of his adherents. Guided by his illuminated in
terpretation of the sacred Word, they are taught to recognize in Jesus Christ the
true and only Jehovah, and no other sense do they affix to the term Lord. They
know no other Trinity than is concentrated in Him. As this, in their view, is-
not a Trinity of persons, but of principles, they consequently know nothing of im
ploring one divine person for the sake of another, just as they know nothing of
an atonement or satisfaction made by one of these persons to another. This they
regard as the grand corruption and perversion of the Gospel, while at the same
time they recognize, in its fullest extent, the absolute and inexorable necessity
both of the incarnation and of the atonement, as they conceive those doctrines to be
taught in the inspired oracles. And, be it observed, they do- not on these points ,
build their faith exclusively on what may be termed the supernatural disclosures
of Swedenborg. They are perfectly willing to abide by the results of the mo6t
fair exegetical process in determining the literal sense of the Word. They re--
quire nothing more than the admission, which you certainly will not withhold,
that the Old Testament Scriptures of " the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms"
ar» of equal divine authority with the New. This conceded, they are prepared-
to show that the Jehovah of the Old Testament is identically the same Divine
Personage with the Jesus of the New, and as they have no intimations of there
being two Jehovahs, one in heaven and another on earth hypostasized in Jesus,
they can conceive of no grounds for such a peculiar economy of redemption as is set'
forth in the great mass of Christian creeds. Yet the redemption-work of Jesus-
is the only foundation of their hope.
The reply to all this will undoubtedly be, that in denying the common construction
of this and the related doctrine of the Trinity, we deny the substantial truth of
each. Here then the matter rests. It becomes a pure question of interpretation,-
and to this question apply, in all their force, the remarks made above as to the
assumed infallibility of one mode of interpretation over all others. On what
solid principle is this to be made out ? And then as to the verdict upon the
morale of the matter—who is to pronounce this-?*

REPLY TO DR. WOODS. 17
From what I have now said, somewhat of a fair judgment may be formed as
to the real community of teaching between Swedenborg and the ordinary stand
ards of Christendom on this single point of our Lord's divinity and his title to
supreme worship. It is easy to see that they are at a measureless remove from
each other. The "Doctrine of the Lord " of Swedenborg may be said to be toto
calo different from that which has obtained currency in the church and from
this flows by necessary consequence an entirely different view of the whole
scheme of dogmatic Christianity. Upon this, however, I do not here enlarge.
My present object is simply to show that Swedenborg's claim to have made a
new revelation of the interior genius of our religion cannot be vacated by the
plea, that he has, in many instances, merely reproduced, in new forms and as
pects, long established and widely admitted truths. These truths here come before
us in an entirely new character, and it is a great wronging of his developments
to represent them as mere common-place truisms. You will observe how
ever, that I am not exhibiting the evidence of the divinity of his revelations, but
simply specifying certain things which are no evidence to the contrary.
You say in addition :
" The writings of Swedenborg unquestionably contain a large amount of
truths, relating to God and Christ, to divine Providence, to saints and sinners, to
the selfishness, deceit, and wickedness of the heart, to the graces of Christianity,
to our dependence on God in connection with our duty to love and obey him,
to the disclosures which will be made of human characters in the future world,
and to a variety of other subjects. Swedenborg teaches some truths in the
language commonly employed. But for the most part, he sets forth well known
and acknowledged truths in a language of his own, —-in a phraseology which he
constantly repeats, and to which he seems to be stiffly devoted, although it is
really very strange and abstruse, and to beginners in the study of his works, fre
quently unintelligible. But in one way or another, either in the usual forms of
expression, or in a singular, philosophical style, or in the peculiar manner of
rhetorical fictions, or dreams, his writings contain many moral and religious
truths."
The peculiarity of diction to which you advert has been frequently remarked
upon and objected to, and is doubtless very apt to impress the novitiate reader
unfavorably. It produced, in the outset, its usual effect upon my own mind,
although this soon passed away, as I became more conversant with the peculiar
genius of his system. On all theological subjects we become habituated to a
certain stereotype phraseology, any departure from which is apt to beget a
latent suspicion of a departure from the essential truth conveyed by it. Now
in Swedenborg's writings, as I have already remarked, the fundamental truths
accredited among Christians are presented in entirely new aspects, being for
the most part referred to the primary psychological principles on which all
moral truths rest. It is not unnatural, therefore, that the established phraseology ,
appear as evil, when yet inwardly he possesses good ; wherefore it is never allowable
for one man to judge of another as to the quality of his spiritual life, for, as was said, the
Lord alone knows this: yet it is allowable for every one to judge of another's quality as
to moral and civil life, for this is of concern to society. It is a very common thing, for
those who have conceived an opinion respecting any truth of faith, to judge of others,
that they cannot be saved, but by believing as they do, which nevertheless the Lord
has forbidden, Matt. vii. 1,2; on the contrary, it has been made known to me by much
experience, that persons of every religion are saved, if so be, by a life of charity, they
have received remains of good and of apparent truth. —A. C. 2884.

should be very considerably modified by the new relations in which the subject-
'
matter of his discourse is exhibited. But it may be justly claimed for our au
thor that no one is more uniformly consistent in the use of terms, or is at more
pains to put the reader, from the beginning, in full possession of the exact mean
ing, in all its various shades, which he would have attached to them. With this
he soon becomes familiar, and from a certain sense of the intrinsic adaptedness of
the word to the idea, he desiderates no other form of expression than what he
finds. The great question in the minds of his receivers is, as to the intrinsic
truth of the thought which is to be conveyed. When satisfied on this score, they
are generally satisfied also, that the phraseology could not well be improved.
I might perhaps even go farther on this head, and say that the language employed
by Swedenborg grows out of the peculiar state in which it was uttered, and that it
has about it a certain breathing of a supernatural sphere, which is altogether sui
generis, and when duly weighed affording no slight evidence of that internal ele
vation of the faculties by which it was undoubtedly prompted. But upon this I
do not insist, though it is a feature of the system which weighs much with me
in my general estimate of the man in his assumed character. He came as
the herald of a dispensation the motto of which is, Vetera transierunt —" Old
things are passed away ; behold, I make all things new." I do not see why this
comprehensive saying may not embrace the forms of theological diction as well
as a thousand other things. If we have new truths imparted, why should they
not be clothed in a new dress ? As to the " constant repetition" of this phraseol
ogy I see nothing more implied in the remark than uniformity of usage, and this
certainly is no fault, provided it be originally adopted upon sufficient grounds.

LETTER III.
Rev. and Dear Six:
In entering upon the more detailed examination of the doctrines under re
view, you say :
" I would direct your particular attention to the test of Swedenborg's principles,
which is laid down by Prof. Bush, who has, with distinguished ability, under
taken their defence. This test he clearly sets before us in the following language.
He says, that all the grand features of the system '
appeal directly to the inner
intuitions of the reason.'—' The truth of Swedenborg's revelations can only be
made apparent by their intrinsic character.' —' The truth of his mission is to be
established by the truth of his message, and by that only.' —'
W e must rely
upon internal evidence.' —'
Kis principles appeal directly to consciousness and
reason.
" I make no objection to this test. But how shall we apply it ? This is a serious
question. How are we to judge of the truth of the message ? How are we to be satis
fied as to the intrinsic character of the system, and as to the internal evidence on which
we are to rely ? The appeal, it is said, is directly to the inner intuitions of the rea
son. But whose reason ? The reason of one man differs widely, as to its state
and mode of exercise, from the reason of another. Consequently the appeal in
different cases will meet with different receptions and lead to different results.
This will certainly be the case, unless the peculiar principles of Swedenborg are
like the first principles or self-evident truths of Geometry, concerning which all
men must form the same judgment. But no one can pretend that this is the
case. In judging of moral and religious subjects, human reason itself does, in

very many cases, need a standard or guide. In other words, the rational being,
man, is, in many cases, incompetent to determine what is truth, without being
instructed by a wisdom superior to his own. If we are consistent Christians,
we believe that we have been thus instructed ; and we have settled it in our
minds, that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are the word of God, clothed
with divine authority, and are the only sure and infallible rule of our faith and practice.
This has become a fundamental principle with us. On the ground of clear and
sufficient evidence, our reason receives it and rests upon it ; and we can no
longer call it in question. Now this word of God has taught us a system of moral
and religious truths, which we can no more doubt, than we can the veracity of
God. When therefore we undertake, in the use of our reason, to form a judg
ment as to the truth of any other system, how strange would it be, if we should
divest our reason of the benefit of its settled convictions ! With what ingratitude
and perverseness should we be chargeable, if we should extinguish or under
value the light which shines upon us from revelation, and go back to the dark
ness of deism and heathenism ! This is what we cannot do. If we would
maintain the character of Christians, we must use our reason, as enlightened by
revelation. The more it is thus enlightened —the more it is furnished with scrip
ture-principles, and the more closely it adheres to those principles in all its act
ings; so much the .more likely will it be to form right judgments. They who
heartily believe the word of God, and duly regard its heavenly light, shall not
walk in darkness. In the case now before us, what better can we do than to
copy the example of the noble Bereans, who searched the Scriptures daily, to see
whether that which they heard was true. We must go directly to the Bible ; we
must go with all our intellectual and moral faculties ; and our great inquiry
must be, wliether the disclosures of Swedenborg are in harmony with the Scriptures.
Our reason and our philosophy, instead of attempting to be a guide to the word
of God, must be guided by it."—p. 15.
I have given this passage at full length, because it embodies, with much dis
tinctness, the jist of the grand objection usually urged against the soundness of
the test which T have here proposed. " The appeal, it is said, is directly to the
inner intuitions of the reason. But whose reason ? The reason of one man differs
widely, as to its state and mode of exercise, from the reason of another. Con
sequently the appeal in different cases will meet with different receptions and
lead to different results." And you intimate that such a claim as I have asserted
for the peculiar principles of Swedenborg cannot be maintained, unless they are
like the first principles or self-evident truths of Geometry. Now from the above
position respecting reason I do not scruple to affirm my total and unequivocal
dissent, and in the case before us I appeal directly to your reason, as well as to
that of every man who is disposed to exercise his faculties upon the evidence of
truth in regard to moral subjects. I cannot doubt for a moment that there is a com
mon reason pertaining to man as man, which will always draw substantially the
same conclusions from the same premises, when those premises are distinctly be
fore the mind. I cannot question that there are moral axioms which command
assent as truly as mathematical axioms, and that nothing more is needed than their
simple enunciation, in a clear light, to receive the instantaneous admission of their
truth. This arises from the very constitution of the human mind. It cannot see
the meaning of certain propositions without at the same time seeing their truth.
The reasoning (jatiocinatio) of different men is undoubtedly different; but the
reason (ratio) of all men is the same, because it is in fact the Universal Reason —the
reason of God himself. The utterances of this inward oracle may be perverted
by the influence of affection and passion. The light of the rational eye may be
darkened by the mists of ignorance, of prejudice, of error, and other causes, but
when the clouds are cleared away it always, in all men, sees the same things in

the same manner. A Hottentot or an Esquimaux must see the propositions of
Euclid in the same light with Newton or La Place, when his mind is opened by
the process of intellectual culture to perceive the truth of the axioms on which
they rest, and to grasp the chain of consecutive demonstration. He must yield
the same assent, upon the same evidence, that is yielded by Edwards or Dwight
to the eternal distinction between right and wrong—to the duty of loving and
serving God—to the propriety of pursuing happiness rather than misery —to the
justice of the Golden Rule —and to various other moral axioms upon which the
well-being of the rational creation obviously depends. All this arises from the
fact of the community of reason in the universal mind of man.
If it be not so, I should be gratified to learn on what grounds you would feel
authorized to pass censure on those who reject the evidence of the truth of the
Christian Religion. You urge the claims of this Religion upon a philosophical
skeptic. He replies that he has given the subject his serious and careful consid
eration, and that the verdict of his dispassionate reason is against it. Do you,
in your judgment, acquit his decision of all wrong ? Are you not inwardly con
scious that there is some radical vice in the mental process by which he has
brought himself to this conclusion ? Do you scruple to assure him that his rea
soning really does violence to his reason ?' Do you not confidently affirm, that
God has so constituted the human mind —that he has established such a harmony
between the dictates of the reason and the grand truths of Revelation —that it is
absolutely impossible mat the latter should be rejected when the former has fair
play ? Neither you nor he may be able to detect the precise point where the
defect in the process inheres, but you are positively certain that the defect exists
somewhere, and that he is not faithful to the voice of reason in rejecting Revelation.
You have not a doubt that the verdict of enlightened reason, when the evidence
is fairly weighed, will evermore be in accordance with the claims of the Christian
faith. It is so in your own case, and you cannot conceive that it should be
otherwise in his.
Yet allow me to ask, with what propriety you can challenge the soundness of
his decision on the principle affirmed in your Lectures, that the reason of dif
ferent men will, on the same subjects, lead them to different results ? How can
you any more justly impeach his reason for rejecting Christianity, than he yours
for embracing it? If I rightly apprehend the purport of your argument, you
have furnished him with a complete apology for his conclusion. In your con
troversy with the skeptic, in behalf of Christianity, you appeal to " the inner in
tuitions of the reason." He says to you, as you to me, " I make no objection
to the test. But how shall we apply it ? To whose reason shall we appeal ;
You submit the matter to my reason and my reason discards the verdict of
yours." What have you to reply so long as he is merely acting on the very
principle with which your logic has furnished him ?
I am here reminded of a very peculiar train of remark bearing somewhat upon
this subject in the Rev. Mr. Landis' reply to my work on the Resurrection.
Whatever may be the success of my attempt to rebut the force of your reasoning
on this head, I certainly feel no difficulty in regard to his. In his chapter on
" The true office of Reason in respect to Revealed Religion," in which he very
truculently takes to task my position, that " reason and religion must be con
sistent with each other," he remarks j—" The statement made by Prof. Bush and

others who have written as vaguely on the subject, neither makes nor allows
any distinction between the principles of reason (so called), which any man in
particular may adopt) and the principles of right reason, such as God both recog
nizes and appeals to in his word : and hence every man is left to infer that the
deductions of his own philosophy (however distorted by his education or his
prejudices), are legitimate, and that the announcements of revelation ought to be
so explained as to harmonize with them." Again, " It is not to be forgotten
that there is the same distinction to be observed between Prof. Bush's view of
right reason, and right reason itself, as between a man's view of truth, and truth
itself." Once more ;
" The Professor perpetually confounds his own philosophy
with true philosophy ; and, of course, leaves the privilege of doing the same to every
man who is satisfied with the legitimacy of his own deductions." The decorum
and the dialectics are here just about upon a par. With a most exquisite assur
ance of infallibility he assumes that my reason must of course be opposed to
right reason, and my philosophy to true philosophy, and why ? Does he inti
mate any other ground of the ex cathedra sentence than that it is opposed to his ?
And is not his equally opposed to mine ? I do not like rudely to disturb any
man's self-complacency, but if it may consist with the deference due to one who
speaks so oracularly, I would fain inquire whence he obtained the authority to
speak thus as the inspired organ of the only " right reason" and the only " true
philosophy ?" By what tokens am I to know that he is indeed invested with
this high prerogative ? So lofty a claim needs to be made out by some adequate
credentials. I should imagine, indeed, that he was not at all aware that there
was any room for preferring the question, yet it does really seem a little question
able how one can affirm, in one breath, that " man's reason has been bruised,
and weakened, and defaced, and greatly obliterated by the fall," and yet in the
next, under the auspices of this very reason, thus bruised, battered and broken,
take it upon him to sit peremptorily in judgment on the opinions of another and
condemn them as undoubtedly irrational and absurd. Is there not at least a
bare possibility, that the deteriorating effects of the fall may have left some
traces of fallibility upon his reason, as well as upon that of those who differ from
him ? May we not, at any rate, deferentially solicit some evidence that he is
commissioned to speak ex officio in the name of whatever " right reason" and
" true philosophy" may be found in the universe ? Is it at all mod apropos to ap
ply to a critic of this stamp the language of Jeremy Taylor—" When a man
speaks reason, it is but reason that he should be heard ; but though he may have
the good fortune, or great abilities to do it, yet he hath not a certainty, no regular
infallible assistance, no inspiration of arguments or deductions; and if he had,
yet because it must be reason that must judge of reason, unless other men's un
derstanding were of the same area, the same constitution and ability, they can
not be prescribed unto by another man's reason." (Lib. of Proph. p. 146.)
I can scarcely doubt that you, my dear sir, will agree with me that nothing is
more supremely ridiculous than such an " 'Ercles' vein" of dogmatism in any
one who has not received letters-patent of infallibility from the Divine fountain-
head of truth. What right has an erring mortal to assume a tone implying that
he is in possession of the true key of wisdom, while I am merely groping and
fumbling at the door with no means of opening it ? With the- same interests at

quiry —what authority has he for intimating that the results of my investigation
are less in accordance with " right reason" than his own ? If he shall prove, by
satisfactory arguments, that my conclusions are unsound, then let him " glory
over" my fallacies ; but let him not assume in the outset, by virtue of some extra
ordinary illumination, that my reason and philosophy are of course at fault,
when he can give no better grounds for the sentence than that they happen to
differ from his. It will be observed, moreover, that he speaks with a kind of
holy horror of the inevitable consequence of my position, viz. that it leaves
to every man the privilege of regarding his philosophy as true philosophy, pro
vided only he is satisfied in his own mind that he has legitimate grounds for
doing so. This is indeed a fearful issue, for it sweeps away at a single stroke the
whole fabric of an authoritative tribunal appointed to hold in abeyance the
right of free opinion —or, in other words, the entire system of Protestant
popery, and reduces everything to the standard of private judgment. I shall
leave the gentleman to mourn over the wreck of such a darling institute, and re
turn to the consideration of your reasoning.
You remark, in the present connection, that " in judging of moral and religious
subjects, human reason itself does, in very many cases, need a standard or guide.
In other words, the rational being, man, is, in many cases, incompetent to deter
mine what is truth, without being instructed by a wisdom superior to his own.
If we are consistent Christians, we believe that we have been thus instructed ;
and we have settled it in our minds, that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testa
ment are the word of God, clothed with divine authority, and are the only sure and in
fallible rule of our faith and practice. This has become a fundamental principle
with us. On the ground of clear and sufficient evidence we receive it and rest
upon
it,
and we can no longer call
it
in question."
I
perceive in all this an elemental truth which
I
am very happy to acknowl
edge. The receivers of Swedenborg insist as strongly as any class of men upon
the need of divine illumination in order to the due exercise of the rational fac
ulty, especially upon all moral and spiritual subjects. They hold that the light
of the Word
is
indispensable to the understanding when dealing with the Word
itself in its interior import, and they trust that the use of the term " influx" in this
relation may not be deemed to derogate from the essential truth of the admission.
Still they would perhaps be disposed to hint at some difficulties pertaining to
the above intimation. To myself, at any rate,
it
is
far from being clear in what
light you would have the above position viewed.
I
obtain no clew to determine
how much
is
included in this settled conviction of the divinity and authority of
the Sacred Scriptures, which you make to depend on a special illumination or
" instruction" imparted to " consistent Christians" by a " wisdom superior to

for you say,
" our reason and our philosophy, instead of attempting
to be a guide to the word of God, must be guided by it." Would you imply that
no man whatever can attain to the conclusion that the Old and New Testaments
are the Word of God without the special enlightening influences of the Holy
Spirit? —or, in other words, that every one who reaches this conviction
is

facto a Christian

worldly and sensual life ? This surely cannot be your meaning, for in this sense
you will hardly deny that even a " Swedenborgian" may arrive at a tolerably
clear assurance that the Bible contains a real revelation from God to man. You
muet have reference to some higher degree of the divine operation on the minds
of men, and yet I am at a loss to conceive what it is or what is the precise effect
you would ascribe to it. Indeed I see not why I may not avail myself of the
very objection which you yourself urge on a subsequent page against what you
intimate as the ground assumed in behalf of Swedenborg's claims. " As the ap
peal is to be made to reason, and reference to be had solely to the intrinsic rea
sonableness and excellence of Swedenborg's writings; then, of course, we are
not to be influenced by the authority which he claims as a divinely commis
sioned interpreter of the Scriptures. If, however, the reason to which the ap
peal is to be made means the illuminated reason of the man of the New Church ;
then the reason of others can have nothing to do with the matter, and the ques
tion would be, why any others are called upon to judge." Now I am wholly
unable to see why your own position is not equally assailable upon precisely
the same grounds. You claim to have been led, by an " illuminated reason,"
to the understanding of the true system of revealed doctrine, and from this emi
nence of attainment do not scruple to pass sentence upon the system of Swe-
denborg as directly at variance with the genuine teachings of the Scriptures.
But how can you arraign the decisions of my reason when left destitute of the
supernatural aids accorded to yours ? Indeed, what can my reason " have to
do with the matter ?" Why am I " called upon to judge" at all ? It would seem
that you had fired a petrel without thinking of the dangerous recoil. But per-
-
haps you design to say that the spirit of God directly informs a " consistent
Christian" as to the canonical authority of the different sacred books. Is this
your meaning ? You are well aware that the settlement of the question respect
ing the canon has ever been the great problem of biblical theology, and that even
to this day learned and good men demur as to the claims of several books of the
Bible to the character of inspiration. Am I to understand from your language,
that the determination of this question forms a part of Christian experience ?
The pious Baxter assures us that this was not the case with him. " For my
part, I could never boast of any such testimony, or light of the spirit, nor reason
neither, which, without human testimony, would have made me believe, that the
book of Canticles is canonical, and written by Solomon, and the book of Wisdom
apocryphal, and written by Philo. Nor would I have known all or any histori
cal books, such as Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Samuel, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, Nehe-
miah, &c. to be written by Divine inspiration, but by tradition." If this is among
the thiugs taught by special illumination to all Christians, why are they still at
variance on the subject ? Is it not a point of vital moment to the interests of
revelation ?
But you will perhaps say—and I do not see what else you can say—that the
effect of this supernatural teaching, which is the privilege of " consistent Chris
tians," is to impart to them a correct knowledge of the genuine scheme of doc
trines contained in the Scriptures, in contradistinction from all the erroneous, fal
lacious, and heretical systems which are professedly deduced from the same
source. But here again we encounter the most serious difficulty in reconciling
this hypothesis with the actual facts of the case. If all "consistent Christians"

are led by special illumination or " instruction" to adopt a peculiar view of the
doctrinal code of the Scriptures, and this illumination really proceeds from the
divine Original of Truth, it is no easy matter to conceive how it should
instruct one class of Christians to draw from this source a form of doctrines
directly at variance with that drawn by another. Yet nothing is more palpable
than the fact, that the most dissonant schemes of religious faith are alleged by
the different sects of Christendom as each the veritable system of the Scriptures,
and each the product of a divine illumination shed upon the minds of its advo
cates.
You can scarcely fail, I think, to appreciate the difficulty and embarrassment
in which I find myself involved in the attempt to put a consistent interpretation
upon your language. I do not apprehend what you would claim as to the na
ture or extent of that divine " instruction" which you represent as something
over and above the mere light of natural reason in fixing an assurance in the
minds of Christians as to the origin and authority of the inspired writings. If
this " instruction" or illumination is genuine, its truth must be self-evidencing,
and if so, it must be, as far as I can see, infallible. How then can the inference
be resisted, that you assume a certain construction of the divine oracles to be
infallibly correct, to the exclusion of every other that differs from it ? But how
is this infallibility to be proved to my satisfaction ? Suppose that I should assert
a claim to an equal assurance of truth, and one derived too from precisely the
same source, on what grounds -will you contest the claim and reject my belief
as heretical and false ? Have you any other standard of appeal than the Scrip
tures themselves ? " But we are instructed by a wisdom superior to our own"
as to the genuine sense of the inspired Word and therefore all doubt is precluded.
It would seem inevitable, therefore, that the reliance here is upon something
more than reason, and yet immediately after you remark, that this fundamental
principle of the Scriptures being the word of God is " received by the reason on
the ground of clear and sufficient evidence." If by this you mean reason acting
simply by its native, unassisted light on the evidences of Christianity con
sidered as a point of mere intellectual inquiry, I discover nothing in the position
which gives you any peculiar advantage in wielding the argument against us,
for we are as well assured on this head, from the dictates of reason, as you can
possibly be. If on the other hand you claim the prerogative of a divinely enlight
ened reason in coming to your conclusions respecting the true system of Christian
doctrine, then, in order to make your position controversially available, it will be
necessary to authenticate this claim by some adequate evidence, since we plead
the same prerogative in support of a very different system.
You go on to say ;—" Now this word of God has taught us a system of moral
and religious truths, which we can no more doubt than we can the veracity of
God." Has taught whom ? In whose name do you here speak? Do you refer
to Christians in general—all those who receive the Scriptures of the Old and
New Testament as the word of God ? But these constitute a variety of sects of
very differing views, and it is certain that they do not all of them deduce the
aame
" system of moral and religious truths" from the same Scriptures, and yet it
is probable that they are all eqnally confident, and no more doubt the truth of
their respective systems than they doubt of the veracity of God, which in fact
they usually identify with the verity of their own system. In this general body

of Christians, the receivers of Swedenborg claim a place, and they too have equal
confidence in the soundness of the system which they derive from the sacred
oracles. But you proceed; —"When therefore we undertake to form a judg
ment as to the truth of another system, how strange would it be, if we should
divest our reason of the benefit of its settled convictions ? With what ingratitude
and perverseness should we be chargeable, if we should extinguish or under
value the light which shine3 upon us from revelation, and go back to the dark
ness of deism and heathenism ?" What is implied in this ? What would you
have the reader understand by " forming a judgment as to the truth of another
system ?" Is not the system of Swedenborg avowedly a Christian system ? How
then is it " another ?" And how is it necessary to " go back to the darkness of
deism and heathenism" in order to adjudicate its claims > Do you regard the
system of Swedenborg as coming before the world in the character of an antag
onist system to Christianity, and to be placed upon a par with Deism, Mahomet-
anism, or Budhism? The whole train of your remark confounds me beyond
measure. The controversy between you and Swedenborg is not one that in
volves the question of a divine revelation having been granted to man, or of
this revelation being comprised within the contents of the Christian Scriptures.
It is in fact the question of the sense of the revelation. Now you may be fully
assured that the sense you ascribe to it is the true sense. I am equally assured
that the sense I put upon it is the correct one. Who shall decide between us ?
What can authorize the condemnation of my view of the meaning of the word
of God, but a conscious infallibility of judgment? This you certainly will not
claim. To what then amounts the assumption of having been taught " a system
of moral and religious truths about which there can be no more doubt than there
is as to the veracity of God." I lay the same claim to this that you do. And so
as to the scope of the following sentence ;—" If we would maintain the character
of Christians, we must use our reason, as enlightened by revelation." Assuredly ;
and do the teachings of Swedenborg breathe the slightest aura of a contrary sen
timent ? Have you ever met, in the writings of his adherents, a single expression
implying an underestimate of the value of revelation as a guide to human rea
son ? Is it not their unanimous aim to call all men to the deep and hearty ac
knowledgment of the Divine Word as the grand source of intellectual and rational
light ? Why then is an adverse argument so constructed as to convey the im
pression that our views are not only unscriplural, but anti- scriptural ? Why is
the reader led to infer that our doctrines can only be met on the ground on
which the Christian apologist meets the deist and the heathen ?
" Our great
inquiry," you say, " must be, whether the disclosures of Swedenborg are in harmony with
the Scriptures." This as understood from the letter, I readily admit to be the true
point of inquiry, but the meaniug when unlocked by the key of the previous re
mark is, whether the disclosures of Swedenborg are in harmony with a certain
scheme of scripture interpretation. But suppose it to be, whether they are consist
ent with any interpretation —whether they are not directly at variance with the
Scriptures, as really as the Koran or the Shasters —still the insinuation, in either
case, can come properly only from one who is infallibly in the possession of the
true scheme of revealed doctrine, and we shall listen with due respect to the
oracle when assured of its source. In the mean time we venture to claim a title

from it a system of moral and religious truths, which we can no more doubt
than we can the veracity of God." If the Christian plants himself upon his
prerogatives, as the Jew did in his controversy with Paul, we say as he did,
" What advantage then hath the Christian ?" And if he allowed the Jews much,
on the score of the " oracles of God being committed to them," we claim our
share in the general boon. Are not we Christians as well as they ?
But we are soon brought to " the conclusion of the whole matter." The
foregoing train of reasoning is merely the throwing out of a kind of logical lasso
by which we are to be entangled and brought up to the confession of a flat de
nial of the canonical authority of a portion of " the word of God."
" But here, at the outset, we are met with an appalling fact, namely, that Swe-
denborg excludes from the word of God a considerable part of what we regard as
the holy Scriptures. It is, in my view, too plain to be doubted, that Christ and the
Apostles acknowledged the very books, and all the books, which now compose
the Old Testament, to be the word of God, and regarded the whole and every part
of them, as of divine authority. Any one who wishes to see this proved clearly
and conclusively, would do well to examine the various treatises which relate to
the subject, particularly the recent publication of Professor Stuart on the canon
of the Old Testament. Our Author, then, by rejecting a part of the books, which
were received by Christ and the Apostles, and which have always been received,
by Jews and Christians, as the word of God, sets himself not only above the
inspired Apostles, but in opposition to Christ himself, to whom God gave the
Spirit without measure, and who came to bear witness to the truth. What shall
we say to these things ? Were the holy Apostles mistaken in regard to the books
which belong to the word of God ? Was the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
full of grace and truth, —was he mistaken ? Must it not be a disordered state of
mind that can lead any man to entertain such an opinion ? The books of the Old
Testament which Swedenborg refused to acknowledge as making a part of the
word of God, are the following, namely ; the two books of Chronicles, Ezra, Nehe-
miah, Esther, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Solomon's Song ; about one sixthpart
of the Old Testament; —and of the New Testament; The Acts of the Apostles, all
the Epistles of Paul, including the Epistle to the Hebrews and the Epistles of Peter,
James, John and Jude ; that is, about half of the New Testament. Swedenborg
says, '
the books of the Word are all those which have the internal sense.' Of
course, chose which he disowns, are those which have not the internal sense. I
know not by what means he determined which of the sacred books have the
internal sense, and which have it not. But in some way he found out, or was
led to think, that the books above named did not readily admit of such a sense,
as his scheme of interpretation required. It seems quite unaccountable, that he
should have excepted some of these books, rather than some which he received.
I do not, indeed, think it strange, that he found most of these books, particularly
the Proverbs, the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles, somewhat intractable,
and hard to be interpreted according to his principles. But it would have been
natural to expect, that, when writing on the subject of conjugial love, whether
in the natural or spiritual sense, he would make the Song of Solomon his Text
book.
" Can it now be expected of us, that we should fall in with a writer, who re-
i'ects
so great a portion of what we verily believe to be the word of God ? If we
lave confidence in Christ as an infallible Teacher, can we submit to the author
ity of one, who, in our opinion, takes a position in opposition to him ? If we
are consistent Christians, can we reject or undervalue the writings of those
whom Christ commissioned to teach in his name, to whom he promised the
Holy Spirit to guide them into all the truth, and who claimed to have their in
structions received as the word of God ? The leading doctrines of the gospel,
as commonly understood by Christians, are set forth most clearly and fully in the
Epistles. Swedenborg disbelieved these doctrines ; and this may have been a
reason with him for rejecting the Epistles. But can it be expected of us, that
we should renounce the fundamental articles of our faith, and those sacred
books, which most definitely teach them, and yield ourselves to another in
structor and follow another guide ?"— p. 16-19.

REPLY TO DR. WOODS. 87
The objection here urged has often been replied to, and I have considered it
at length in my " Statement of Reasons for embracing the Doctrines and Disclo
sures of Swedenborg." I there put it upon the ground which you have designat
ed in the following paragraph, as to which you will permit me to say, that it
has not exactly the air of justice to bring an unequivocal and unqualified charge,
and then to exhibit it in that modified form in which only we admit its truth. If
Swedenborg does not absolutely reject, disown, and exclude certain books from
the Canon, such a charge ought not to be absolutely made at the outset. You
may, indeed, hold that what he does teach on the subject leads by legitimate
consequence to such a sentence of rejection, but as this is not admitted on the part
of your opponents, I think your conclusion should have been stated at the close,
and not in an absolute form at the commencement of the process by which you
would establish it. But I give our answer in your words.
" It may possibly be said, that Swedenborg did not absolutely reject the parts
of Scripture above named, but only gave them a lower place, and invested them
with a lower authority, than belongs to the word of God. —p. 19.
This may not only " possibly" be said, but it is positively, and unequivocally, and
invariably said, and the true and only point of debate is, whether it is said on
good grounds. This point is fairly first to be settled before he can be absolutely
charged with rejecting certain portions of the Scriptures, for it is at least possi
ble, that the distinction which he affirms may still consist with the retaining of
the present constitution of the canon undisturbed. This, at any rate, is the po
sition assumed by those who adopt his system. But you ask on what grounds
he made the distinction.
" Why did he receive the book of the Judges, or of the Kings, as the word of God
more than the Chronicles, or Ezra, or Nehemiah ? Why the gospel of Luke,
more than the Acts of the Apostles, which is only a continuation of the Christian
History by the same writer ? Why the Revelation of John, more than the Epistles
of John? And why any of the writings of John, more than those of the other
Apostles 7 And then as to Swedenborg's test ; who can find out why the rejected
books do not admit of the inner or spiritual sense, as naturally and easily as the
other books of Scripture ? It will perhaps be said, that he did not propose to
exclude the disowned books from the printed volume of the Scriptures, or to
make a new Bible. It may be that he did not distinctly propose this. It may
be that he was willing the Apostolic Epistles and the other degraded books,
should continue for a time to be bound up with the word of God, as our Protest
ant forefathers were willing that the Apocryphal books should be bound up
with the Holy Scriptures. But our forefathers were honest men, and took care
to give a distinctive name to those books, showing that they were not regarded as
belonging to the canon of Scripture. They designated them as the Apocrypha.
Now Swedenborgians ought to be equally honest, and at the beginning of their
Bible, they ought to give an exact list of the books constituting the word of God,
as Genesis, Exodus, &c., and after that a list of books of a lower character, not
constituting any part of the word of God, and not possessed of plenary divine
authority, such as Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, &c., in the Old Testament, and Acts,
Romans, and all the Epistles in the New Testament. Let this table be honest, and
show just what Swedenborg meant. And by and by, when the New Jerusalem
church becomes large enough to have a Bible society of their own, let them
omit altogether those books which do not belong to the word of God, and so
make their Bible smaller and cheaper ; unless they choose to supply the place
of the excluded books by some of the revelations of their Prophet. —But why
should I say, some of his revelations ? If his claims are founded in truth, all his
revelations are, in the highest sense, from God, and ought to be published and
circulated, as constituting apart, yea, the greater part of the Holy Scriptures." —

28 REPLY TO DR. WOODS.
With all New Churchmen I may say, that the first and paramount question, in
regard to Swedenborg, is the question of his supernatural enlightenment, or of
his intromission into the world of spirits. They require to be positively satis
fied on this head at the outset, but when satisfied here, they have very little diffi
culty with anything that follows, resting upon his assertion as to the results
of the peculiar state into which he was brought. For a very full and undoubt-
ing reliance on the truth of his statements, they find an ample warrant in the
nature of the case. They see that a supernatural, i. e., a Divine, influence, ope
rating upon his spirit is the very essence of his claim. They are convinced that
such an illumination as he asserts in regard to himself transcends everything
short of a direct and immediate putting forth of the Divine power to effect it.
They see clearly that they must admit this, if they admit anything. If then such
a privilege was conferred upon him by the Most High himself, it is equally ob
vious to their minds that it must have been for an end worthy the source from
which it flowed. But they cannot conceive it as by any means consistent with
such an end, to have allowed the mixing of error with truth in the revelations
granted, as this would be to defeat the effect of the truth. They are persuaded,
therefore, that they are authorized to repose implicit confidence in what
ever averments he may make in regard to the laws and phenomena of the other
life, and especially as to the nature and constituents of the Sacred Word, which
depend directly on those laws. If upon these points he was instructed from a
supernatural source, they feel no hesitation to receive his information as authen
tic and true in the highest degree. This is their mode of reasoning on the
subject, and they are unable to see wherein it is defective. The whole matter
resolves itself into the question of the truth or falsehood of the main assump
tion, i. e. whether he was actually, as he affirms, translated in spirit into the spi
ritual sphere. But this question is settled to their minds by the force of the evi
dence adduced, which the nature of my present object does not require me to
recite. I can only refer those who would weigh it, to the body of his works, and
the various Appeals and Apologies which have been put forth by his advocates.
My purpose is simply to rebut the force of certain objections urged against the
system in whole or in part. It would require a volume to go over the whole
ground in a positive form of discussion.
Let it not be thought however that we deem ourselves shut up to an absolutely
blind deference to his authority, without the slightest perception of the intrinsic
truth of what he has said, or any confirmation, from other quarters, of the deci
sion he has made relative to the character and claims of the different books com
posing the present canon. We find, for instance, on recurring to the Hebrew
codex, that the very books to which he assigns a secondary rank are, for some
reason, thrown together at the close of the volume and reputed by the Jews as
having been the product of a lower degree of the divine afflatus than is recog
nized by them in the origination of the books to which Swedenborg assigns the
first place. How is this to be accounted for ? Does it not look as if Swedenborg
had some authority, from the ancient estimate of these writings, for the discrim
ination he has made? Does not the censure cast upon him, for the liberty he
has taken, redound upon the Jewish Church ? Have they not uniformly made
in effect the same distinction that he has in regard to the degree of the supernat

ural influence exerted upon the minds of the writers of the different books* —de
noting this distinction by ascribing the one class to the indwelling of the She-
kinah with the writers, and the other by that of the Ruach Hakkodesh or Holy Spirit ?
The truth is, there is no subject in the whole circle of biblical Archaeology so
utterly at loose ends as this of the canonicity of the Scriptures. It is still the vexed
question of theologians, and no man who has not made it a special point of in
quiry can imagine the difficulties by which it is surrounded or the vagueness of
the principles on which the determination both of Papists and Protestants rests.
Scarcely a single author can be named who has treated the subject of inspira
tion in connection with the psychological state of the writers while inditing
the books, and yet it is precisely here that the pith of the question lies. Most
heartily therefore do I subscribe to the following remarks of Mr. Parsons in his
review of Dr. Pond ;—" On what does the canon of Scripture rest, excepting the
opinion of a number of learned men, opposed by the great majority of the Chris
tian church, reached after much discussion, not to say some angry controversy,
and resisted by many who are recognized by the whole Protestant Church, as
eminently wise and good ? And is this canon so fenced about with sanctity, as
to justify the outcry of impiety which assails us ? Is this canon itself given by in
spiration ? Are we the first, who have doubted or denied its accuracy ? Does not
Dr. Pond know, that precisely these questions have always existed in the Christian
Church, and have often divided its branches ? The impossibility of settling these
questions, as much, perhaps, as any other one point, broke off the negotiations
between Leibnitz, Molinus, and Bossuet ; from which all parties, at one time,
hoped to reunite the scattered members of the church. The simple and unques
tionable facts are, that any one may take his Bible to be that book which is so
called, and ask no more ; but it is composed of many books, and if he goes a
single step in the inquiry, why are just these books received, and all others rejected ?
he will find himself at once surrounded by darkness. No man, no book, no fact,
no theory, can give any answer which shall go beyond a probable conjecture.
Where, then, is the justice, where the decency, of the outcry that assails us ?
When it is made by the wholly uneducated, we pass it by in silence ; but when
it comes from the Seminary at Bangor (Andover), we cannot but wish that they
would not pursue their controversy in utter contempt of justice. Is it not one
among the inestimable blessings which the Lord is now giving to mankind,
through His New Church, that this great question is now settled and determined
by a fixed and definite standard ? It is not the arbitrary dictum of Swedenborg
which decides this for future ages, but the unerring test of the science of corres
pondence." - *
You will easily have gathered from the above, the answers which we return
to your queries. We believe, as you intimate, that Swedenborg did not " abso-
* " The Rabbinic writers maintain that the authors of the Cetubim (Hagiographa)
enjoyed only the lowest degree of inspiration, as they received no immediate communica
tion from the Deity, like that made to Moses, to whom God spake face to face; and that
they did not receive their knowledge through the medium of visions and dreams, as was
the case with the prophets or the writers of the second class, but still that they felt the
Divine Spirit resting on them, and inspiring them with suggestions. This is the view
maintained by Abarbanel, Kimchi, Maimonides, and Elias Levita." Kitto's Biblical
Cyclopedia, (Art. Hagiographa). It is true that the book of Daniel is included by the
Jews in the Hagiographa, to which Swedenborg assigns a plenary inspiration, but rea
sons may be assigned for this which do not affect the general argument.

lutely reject certain parts of the Scriptures, but only gave them a lower place, and
invested them with a lower authority than belongs to the Word of God." We
believe that he did this, because he was qualified and authorized to do it, and
this belief is founded on the sufficiency, to our minds, of the evidence he has
afforded to this effect and this, we contend, is the true question at issue. We
believe lhat the test he has designated is the true test, because he has said it is, and
as the fact of an internal or spiritual sense in the Word, and the principles on
which it is developed, constitute the most important feature of his disclosures,
we cannot conceive that he should have been liable to error on this head. We
rely, therefore, with the utmost assurance on his declarations relative to every
thing pertaining to the character of the Word. This assurance can only be
shaken by an exposure of the insufficiency of the evidence of his general
claim. I shall endeavor to show, moreover, that the principles themselves have
an internal evidence of truth.
As to the intimation of unfairness in failing to designate the distinction in
question, we hold that there is no ground for
it,
as he has most unequivocally
stated what books possess the character of divinity, and what do not, and we
think that an invaluable service has been rendered to the cause of truth by put
ting to rest
a
question which has agitated the church in all ages, and which in
its present form, gives an advantage to the Romanist of which the Protestant
has never been able to deprive him.
The reply thus given to your objections on this score covers a wide field in
reference to the contents of your work, and will preclude the necessity of a spe
cific consideration of various items of similar tenor occurring throughout the
volume.
I
meet them by the general assertion, that the evidence which satisfies
us of Swedenborg's illumination at all, satisfies us of
it
also in respect to all that
he has said on this subject.
If
this evidence
is
inconclusive, we beg
it
may be
shown in what respects.
I
shall go still more largely into the scriptural subject on a subsequent page,
but in the present connection
I
will not expose myself to the charge of declining
to meet the brunt of a formidable objection arrayed in the following paragraph.
" No concession or declaration of the disciples of Swedenborg, that the exclu
ded books of Scripture have or may have some inferior kind of inspiration, can
give any satisfaction to those, who believe, with Paul, that
'
all Scripture
is
given
by inspiration of God,' and, consequently, that all Scripture without exception,
is
the word
of
God. What
is
that inspiration worth, which is not from God, and
which does not invest what
is
inspired with full divine authority
?
Whatever
is
not the word of God,
is
the word of man." —
f. 20.
If
I
were disposed to be severely critical and stand upon the minutiae of con
troversial fairness,
I
should scarcely refrain from a passing stricture upon the
phrase,
" excluded books of Scripture," for which
I
recognize no authority in
anything that Swedenborg has said on the subject. He neither excludes from
their place, nor detrudes from their rank, any of the biblical writings. He grants
to all the books of Scripture all the inspiration which
is
ordinarily ascribed to
them, while for some he challenges an incomparably higher character, in this
respect, than has ever before been thought to be predicable of them. And
this he does because such he learned in the spiritual world to be the truth. But
in doing
it
he
is
unjustly thought to take away from one portion what he gives
to another.

REPLY TO DR. WOODS. 31
Again, the reader would be apt, without farther instruction, to infer that you
considered the sentence of Paul to include the whole body of biblical writings,
instead of those only which constitute the Old Testament. But the defect of
discrimination here may fortunately be supplied from your own work on " Inspira
tion" published some years ago.
" I here take for granted, what has often been
satisfactorily proved, that when Paul speaks of all Scripture, he must be under
stood to mean all the writings which were held sacred by the Jews at that time ;
and that those writings were the same which constitute the Old Testament now
in common use."—p. 63.
But this does not advance us to the true point of determination. The question
still remains as to the genuine purport of the language, which, as you have
hinted in the work referred to, is subject to some doubt. The verb " is," which
constitutes the whole affirmation, is deficient in the original Greek, and is sup
plied by the English translators as an index to their interpretation of the passage.
The sentence undoubtedly requires a verb somewhere, but the place of its inser
tion depends upon the judgment of the translator. In the received version it
stands in the first clause.—" All scripture is given by inspiration of God, &c."
Baxter, Grotius, Schleusner, and others render the passage thus; —"All scripture
given by inspiration of God, is also profitable, &c." The original, I think, will
admit, without violence, of either rendering, though inclined myself to regard
the common version as more consonant to the Greek idiom than the other. But
even thus translated the theopneusty ascribed to the " all," or every, " Scripture,"
does not in itself define the precise nature or degree of the inspiration affirmed. It
predicates of certain writings a certain character expressed by the term God-
breathed, implying undoubtedly a special kind of influence, from a supernatural
source, put forth upon the spirits of the writers and controlling the form and
genius of their compositions. We may grant that these books have all of them
been written by men who were moved by devout promptings, which are to be
referred for their source to the afflatus of the Spirit of God, although I do not
know that the phrase " holy men" applied to them by Peter necessarily implies
the personal holiness or sanctity of the individuals employed for the purpose. The
epithet
" holy" may have respect rather to their office, which would naturally
confer a peculiar consecration upon them, as the chosen media of divine commu
nications ; and you are well aware that the primary import of holy is set apart.
The true idea of inspiration, I think, is that which places it in the writings and
not in the writers. The distinctive character induced upon the sacred books and
constituting them a divinely inspired word, does not, I imagine, flow forth from
the internal states, as to goodness and truth, of the several persons by whom
they were indited. They might be recipients of the divine influx, for a particu
lar purpose, without being at the same time truly regenerate men, and the
function they performed may have been a sufficient ground for denominating
them holy. If Saul had written psalms at the time when the "spirit of the Lord"
came upon him, and they had been incorporated into the Hagiographa of the
Jews, I do not know that this fact would have required any modification at all of
the saying of Peter, that in inditing the Scriptures " holy men of God spake as
they were moved by the Holy Ghost."
But conceding, for the present, that the writers of the Old Testament were, in
their measure, good men, and that there was a general inflowing into their affec

tions and thoughts of a divine principle, as there is more or less into those of all
good men, still I am unable to perceive that this kind of inspiration, which may-
have been common to them all, must necessarily preclude the idea of a still
higher influence having been imparted to some, so that the product of their
promptings shall have been far more purely divine than that of the others. This
we are taught by Swedenborg is the fact. That portion of the Scriptures which
is justly denominated the Word of God is essential divinity itself—a verbal embodi
ment of the eternal Truth which forms a constituent part of the Divine nature.
While, therefore, we recognize a general theopneusty or divine breathing ascribed
by Paul to all the books constituting the Old Testament Scriptures, we still regard
this as something incomparably lower than that plenary divine afflatus under
which the Word, strictly so called, was written. The distinction has been well
expressed by Mr. Noble in his treatise on the subject. " It is customary with
biblical critics, to consider inspiration as something inseparably attached to the
persons inspired, so that whatever they might write, from the time of their re
ceiving the endowment to their life's end, would be an inspired composition : and
some even appear to consider the exercise of the gift as left entirely to the dis
cretion of the party possessing it. That there is such a species of inspiration as
this, we readily admit ; and also, that it was possessed by the writers of some of
the books contained in the collection called the Bible, —perhaps by them all : but
without an inspiration very different from this, imparted either in addition to it
or quite independently of
it,
no composition that can be called, in a strict and
proper sense, " the Word of God," could ever have been written. This, we have
seen, must be given by a plenary divine inspiration
;
and such an inspiration,
it
is
evident, instead of being a constant attendant on any one, could last no longer
than while he was delivering the message, or was writing the book, for which
it
was afforded.
It
might return to the same person again, as
it
commonly did to
the old prophets, or
it
might not
:
and whatever they might say or write during
the intervals, could only partake of that inferior inspiration capable of being at
tached to a person
;
and not necessarily of this. We have seen that this inferior
inspiration
is
the only one now generally acknowledged to belong to any of the
books contained in the Bible
:
we admit that some of these books may be com
posed from this kind of inspiration, and thence have no sense beside that of the
letter
:
but we contend that the far greater quantity, both in bulk and number
are certainly written by the higher inspiration, and have a spiritual sense
throughout." —Tien. Insp. p. 240.
With this your respected colleague expressly agrees, who also recognizes the
historical fact of a lower degree of inspiration being ascribed by the Jews to the
Hagiographa. "In fact, the lowest gradation of inspiration ascribed by the
Rabbies to the Ketubini,
is
as high as Christianity demands, or, as one may say,
permits us to ascribe to man. No man, not even Moses or Isaiah, was uniform
ly
and always inspired. Of all God's messengers, only one received the gift of
the Spirit without measure
;
and he was the only one who never erred and never
sinned. Others were inspired for
a
particular purpose, and (it may be) remained
so, until that purpose was accomplished. Then they returned to their usual
state. So
it
was even with Moses
;
and so with all the other prophets or priests
concerned with the writing of the Old Testament Scriptures." —(Stuart on 0. Test.

You will scarcely fail to infer from this, that your solemn remonstrance on the
score of a virtual annulling, by Swedenborg's assumptions, of the authority of
Christ and the Apostles, has extremely little weight with us. We find that our
Lord referred to " the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms" as testifying of him,
and we cordially abide by his authority in this reference, and whenever you
will clearly demonstrate that this classification of the sacred and canonical books
includes those to which Swedenborg assigns a secondary rank, we will seriously
re-consider the grounds of our present judgment in regard to them. I have
read the work of Professor Stuart to which you refer, and though I willingly
bear testimony to the careful collation^and extensive research evinced in
it,
yet on the single point of the Hagiographa
I
do not think his results conclu
sive, or that he has done full justice to the opposite views of Hengstenberg in
support of the Talmudic bibliology. His work
I
regard as a very triumphant
refutation of the theory of Mr. Norton and his school, but as inadequate to
countervail the decisions of Swedenborg on the particular department in ques
tion. You will of course feel yourself at liberty to attribute as much of this judg
ment as you think proper to the influence of a pupil's defereuce to the authority
of a master.
As to the impiety of a constructive charge of mistake brought against the Lord
himself, we could not well fail to be as much horrified at the bare thought of
it
as you can yourself be, should we for a moment deem that the imputation
rested upon any sufficient basis. His clear decisis upon any question
is,
in our
view, the ultimate law of heaven and earth. We should not dare to doubt, for
an instant, the canonicity of any book to which he plainly ascribes such a char
acter
;
but in the present instance we are not satisfied that he has positively pass
ed the judgment which you suppose, and therefore your remonstrance on this
score does not reach our convictions.
It
falls,
if
I
may so say, upon a certain
callosity in our minds, from which
it
suffers a rebound and leaves us unaffected.
The difficulty you find in conceiving "by what means he determined which
of the sacred books have the internal sense and which have
it
not,"
is
to my ap
prehension no greater than that of conceiving how he should have learned that
there was any spiritual sense at all—any, that is, depending on a fixed and de
finable law. We have no difficulty in recognizing the truth of the fundamental
law which he has laid down on this score, and we see more or less clearly that
the application of this law brings us to the very results which he has announced
respecting the character of the books in question.
You remark, in one of the paragraphs above cited, that " the leading doctrines of
the gospel, as commonly understood by Christians, are set forth most clearly and
fully in the Epistles. Swedenborg disbelieved these doctrines; and this may
have been a reason with him for rejecting the Epistles." Admitting, merely for
the sake of argument, the propriety of the term " reject" in this connection, our
mode of reasoning on this subject
is
directly the reverse. We believe that his
dissent from these doctrines, as popularly understood, was not strictly anterior to
the estimate he was led to form of the Epistles, but subsequent and consequential to
it. He was enabled to perceive that
a
certain grand principle reigned in the
construction of certain books in the Bible, and that this principle did not obtain
in regard to certain other books. This perception was entirely independent of
any particular form of prior belief or disbelief; at least

nection with any preformed doctrinal sentiments, nor is it possible to show that
such sentiments had the least influence in prompting the verdict he has pro
nounced upon the Epistles as compared with the Gospels. Indeed, considering
the circumstances of his birth, training, and ecclesiastical relations, the presump
tion would undoubtedly be, that he previously believed the prevalent doctrines of
his country and age, until instructed, from the source abovementioned, in their
fallacy. But however this may be, certain it is that it can never be shown that
Swedenborg " rejected," as you term
it,
the Epistles from the fact of his previ
ously rejecting the doctrines they contain. The principles on which his discrimi
nation
is
made involve no relation to any prior form of faith.

LETTER IV.
Rev. and Dear Sir
:
In submitting to an attentive examination the scope of your remarks upon
" the predicted effects of the revelations of Swedenborg,"
it
may seem paradox
ical to say that my chief difficulty in replying to
it
consists in finding no difficulty
at all. Yet such
is
the fact.
I
am at a loss to conceive the exact state of mind
that could have originated the vein of remark to which you here give utterance
as having the force of an objection to the general claims of the system excepted
to.
I
transcribe the passage.
"
I
shall now remark briefly upon the predicted effects
of
the revelations
of
Sweden
borg.
It
was his confident belief, that
'
the august dispensation,' (as
it
has been
called,) which he introduced, would be followed by glorious results. He says,
'
as for the state of the church —this
it
is
which will be dissimilar hereafter.
Henceforth the man of the church will foe in a more free way of thinking in spir
itual things, because spiritual liberty has now been restored to him.' Swedenborg
thought that the man of the church would be free from the slavery and captivity
under which he had been suffering, and would be able to perceive interior truths
and thus to become more like himself. Professor Bush speaks very eloquently of
the new dispensation which Swedenborg introduced, as an epoch of sublime char
acter—as the Lord's second coming, which was to signalize itself by the most strik
ing phenomena in the political and moral world. Such an event, he says, must
touch all the secret springs of revolution, must infuse a new and omnipotent ele
ment into all the great principles of human action.
'
The coming of the Lord —the
descent of the New Jerusalem —shakes heaven and earth.' This he regards as
'
the true clew to all the grand civil and ecclesiastical movements of the age.'
Again he says,
'
Swedenborg has broached what we affirm to be the true theory
of the moral, religious, and political phenomena of the age in which we live.
He has suggested the ample and adequate cause of the astounding effects every
where visible around us. He has professedly put his finger upon the primum
mobile of the complicated changes that are incessantly transpiring on every side.'
—
'
He refers all the grand developments which are now swelling to a superb
revolution in the state of the world, to the passing away of an old dispensation
and the ushering in of
a
new one.'" —p. 21.
I
should certainly deem
it
very indecorous to intimate a want of seriousness
in any part of the argument you have seen fit to institute against the positions of
Swedenborg and the firm belief of his adherents. Nor can
I
for
a
moment ques
tion your competency to distinguish between cause and effect in weighing the
character of the system under review. Yet one or the other of these suppositions

seems to be forced upon me in the attempt to account for such a strange inver
sion —such a palpable var^on irponpov or last foremost
—as I detect in your rea
soning on this head. The very language employed conveys an idea as foreign
from the mind of a New Churchman as can well be imagined. He knows noth
ing of any " predicted effects of Swedenborg's revelations" considered merely
as revelations, and apart from the things revealed. Who has predicted them ?
You say of Swedenborg that " it was his confident belief that the '
august dis
pensation* (as it has been called) which he introduced, would be followed by
glorious results," and the reader is evidently left to infer that these results
would flow from the mere announcement of the dispensation, or from his personal
agency in
it,
instead of referring them to the legitimate operation of the truth and
principles which really constitute the dispensation. His disclosures consist sim
ply of the declaration of a high order of causes, made known to him, which in the
Divine Providence were then at work, and which would issue in corresponding
effects in the state of the world and of the church. His revelations were the reve
lations of these causes, but the revelations themselves no more produce the effects
than the astronomer's calculations of an eclipse produce the eclipse. The
eclipse takes place whether calculated or not
;
and so, although
it
was indeed
according to the order of the divine counsels, that the annunciation of the pass
ing away of an old economy and the ushering in of a new one, should accom
pany the event itself, yet the event
is
one thing, and the intelligence of
it
another,
which
it
would not seem very natural to confound together,
ft
may doubtless
be admitted that Swedenborg was very confident that the dispensation which he
introduced (by announcing it) would be followed by glorious results
;
yet he
never thought of referring them to anything else than to the primary cause to
which they would be owing. This cause according to him was the fact of the
occurrence of the Second Advent of the Lord, to which you yourself allude as
the alleged ground of the expectation.
If
this position be well founded,
is
it
not
sufficient to warrant all he has said in regard to the inevitable effects
?
Will not
" an epoch of such sublime character signalize itself by the most striking phe
nomena in the political and moral world ?" And
is
it
not obvious that this
is
the
true point of debate —whether his teaching respecting the nature and time of the
Second Advent be sustained by competent evidence or not
?
How
is
it
possible
that you should pass by this as a question of no account, when
it
is
in fact the
hinge on which the whole controversy turns
?
If the coming of the Lord
is
an
event to take place spiritually, and not in
a
personal and visible manner, will
it
not " shake heaven and earth ?" Can you conceive
it
to be otherwise
?
And
is
not the question a fair theme of discussion
?
We distinctly assert that we are
prepared to show, by the most legitimate process of interpretation, that
if
such
an event
is
ever to occur,
it
must occur at the time and in the manner which
Swedenborg has asserted. Why do you decline to meet our arguments
?
And
why do you feel at liberty to shift the issue from the cause to the effect
?
If you
believe the Bible, you believe that at some time or other " the holy city, the New
Jerusalem,
is
to descend from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
her husband." Can you suppose for a moment that the bare annunciation or
prediction of such a descent will effect
it
?
The prediction has indeed been made,
and the time and manner of its fulfilment
is
a perfectly proper subject of inquiry,
and one too about which every Christian, and especially every Christian minis

ter ought to have an opinion. If he slurs it over, or puts it away from considera
tion, as among the mysterious things with which he has no concern, he dishon
ors the divine revelation —he virtually charges God with making useless disclo
sures, and that too in a book which bears upon its front the emphatic assurance
—" Blessed is he that readeth and keepeth the sayings of this book." How does
he know that he has no concern in the oracles respecting the New Jerusalem
and the Second Advent ? Is it not possible that diligent inquiry might bring
him to a very different conclusion ? Would the Jew have been justified in plead
ing that the predictions respecting the Messiah and the First Advent were veiled
in such impenetrable obscurity that it were a waste of labor to attempt to inves
tigate their meaning ? Was not this the very rock on which the nation, as a
body, split ? And is it for Christian men to enact over again the same infatuation .'
Be assured, my dear sir, there is a danger here of which the Christian world is
but little aware. It is impossible for any one who has not examined the proph
ecies with attention to be positively certain of safety in neglecting to ponder the
very announcements which Swedenborg has made respecting the character of
the present era. We may be at the point at which it can properly be said of us,
" 0 that thou hadst known the day of thy visitation !"
In view of the scope of my remarks, so amply quoted above, I was, in the pe
rusal, anticipating of course your reply to the fundamental assumption, so clearly
indicated throughout, that all the signal effects adverted to were traceable to the
great cause assigned by Swedenborg, when, to my surprise, I encountered the
following quasi rejoinder:
" I must leave it to the followers of Swedenborg to make it appear, that the
grand social, moral and intellectual movement, which, during the last eighty
years has been changing the face of the civilized world, has been owing to his
system. Let it be, that the grand movement referred to, did commence about
the middle of the last century. The question to be answered is, what influence
the revelations of Swedenborg had to originate that movement, or to carry it
forward. Many events are connected in point of time, which have no connect
ion as cause and effect. Many learned men, now living, were born just before the
American revolution. But who ever thought that any or all of those births had
any influence in promoting the revolution? Let any advocate of Swedenborg
show, if he can, that his principles specially contributed, in any way, to the
revolutions alluded to, or that they had at the. time, or have had since, any par
ticular tendency to promote them. Other things can be mentioned, and often
have been mentioned, which manifestly had such a tendency. But who among
the profoundest writers on the affairs of nations, whether philosophers, histori
ans, or civilians, ever perceived or imagined any connection between the reve
lations of Swedenborg, and the grand civil, moral, and intellectual changes which
have occurred during the last 80 or 90 years ?—p. 23.
The " followers of Swedenborg" will not probably be particularly " careful to
answer thee in this matter." They assume to " make" nothing " appear" on
this head but their full belief and assurance that the " grand social, moral, and
intellectual movement" referred to is due to the principles and agencies which
Swedenborg's system discloses, and which are as much the cause of his system
itself as of anything else. Nothing more, I conceive, is necessary in reply to
the drift of the argument in this paragraph, which is concentrated in the following
query ;—" Who among the profoundest writers on the affairs of nations, whether

lectual changes which have occurred during the last eighty or ninety years ?"
The connection asserted is between these changes and the things revealed by Swe-
denborg, and it is a matter of very small consequence whether this has been per
ceived by the philosophers or not. Their perception is not unfrequently very ob
tuse when they come to deal with the causes of things. The historian Gibbon
undertook, in his great work, to assign the causes of the rapid spread and estab
lishment of Christianity in the Roman empire. The argument was reviewed
by Priestley, who showed very conclusively that what the historian took for
causes were merely effects. Your argument, I humbly conceive, makes a still
greater mistake by confounding the anouncemeut of causes with the tauses themselves.
The assumptions hinted at in the following paragraph are indeed substantially
made by Swedenborg, and I have yet to learn that they are contravened by any
thing advanced in your phamplet.
" Swedenborg did indeed teach, that the men of the church would be the men>
who would experience the most signal effects of the New dispensation ; that
they were the ones, who would be freed from the bondage of error, and would
be more spiritual, more heavenly, and more active in doing good. The whole
church, Protestant as well as Catholic, before his teachings were published, was,
he thought, in a state of total darkness. He takes high ground on this subject,
and asks —' Who in the Christian world would have known anything of heaven
or hell, unless it had pleased the Lord to open in some one the sight of his spirit,
to show and to teach ?' The whole Christian world, he thought, had gone
astray from the truth, and involved itself in the grossest ' falses,' and was sunk
to the lowest degradation. He held that all the churches, the whole body of Chris
tians, were ignorant of the true meaning of the Scriptures ; and that he was com
missioned to teach what had not been known respecting God and Christ, heaven
and hell, and all the great things of religion, and that the New Jerusalem Church
which he ushered in, was the only true church, and was to be the salt of the
earth, and the light of the world."—p. 23.
So far as the " men of the church" do really experience the life and power of
the New Dispensation, they do undoubtedly become " more free from the bond
age of error, more spiritual, and more heavenly" than others. If I do not add,
" more active in doing good," it is not because action or life
—a life of beneficent
use —is not the grand constituent element of their religion, but because the pri
mary object of their solicitude is being good, and because their views on this
head may not perhaps ultimate themselves in precisely such forms of benevolent
activity as you would deem the natural or necessary result. As a general prin
ciple, they regard the neighbor whom they are to love and to benefit as the vicinut,
the one near by, and the salutary influence they would fain exert upon him they
believe will be propagated, like widening waves, as from so many centres till
it finally reaches the circumference of society and of the race. Looking upon
this as the established order of heaven, they endeavor to conform to
it,
and
while they oppose no impediment or remonstrance to the various reforming or
missionary operations of the age, they ask to be not harshly judged
if
they en
deavor to accomplish their " labors of love" in the way which strikes them as
most accordant with the true genius of the moral code which they have adopted.
They humbly trust they are doing something for the most important interests of
humanity, but what they have been taught respecting the inseparably orderly
connection between Truth and Good, prevents an alliance with schemes aiming

at the latter which at the same time involve principles or doctrines that, in their
judgment, compromise the former. If it be said that this is no argument why
they should not league their efforts, on the ground of their own faith, to secure
the extension of their peculiar religious sentiments and the good which they
embody, I can only reply, that their numbers, from causes which they can well
assign to themselves, have been hitherto so few, and those so scattered, that
concert of action, to any great degree, has been almost impracticable. But from
existing omens they regard the prospect in this respect as daily brightening,
and the lapse of a few years may perhaps give a new aspect, in this respect, to
the New Church.*
As to the alleged implication of a reigning darkness, error, and falsity in the
great body of the then existing Christian church, we have no disposition to
deny or evade its truth. On the contrary, our belief in the truth of the charge is most
firm and unwavering. We are fully assured that Swedenborg was " commis
sioned to teach what had not been known respecting God and Christ, heaven
and hell, and all the great things of religion." We believe too that the condition
of the church, under this prevailing blindness and deadness to the interior spir
itual truths of the Word, was among the chief reasons which rendered his mis
sion necessary. We cannot conceive how it were possible, that the Gospel of
God our Saviour should exert its appropriate moral power over the souls of men
without a distinct revelation of the essential and formal nature of heaven and
hell, and of the fixed and immutable laws by which human destiny, in the other
life, is governed. We perceive that previous to his disclosures there were no
definite ideas held or enunciated on these subjects —that the future life was a field
of endless conjecture —that the fundamental principles on which the relation of
the spiritual to the natural world subsists were likewise a theme of perpetual
guessing —and that this general absence of all distinct knowledge on these heads
had given rise to an almost universal relaxation of the life and power of true
godliness, the essence of which is charity, and which can only flourish as it is
fed and sustained by an intelligent perception of its fixed relation, according to
immutable laws, with the realities of the spiritual world. On all these subjects
* " The causes why the New Church, which is called the Holy Jerusalem, is first to
commence with a few, afterwards with greater numbers, and so at last to arrive to its
full state, are several ; the first is, that its doctrine, which is the doctrine of love to the
Lord and charity towards the neighbor, cannot be acknowledged and thence received,
except by those who are interiorly affected with truths, and no others are interiorly af
fected with truths but they who see them, and they only see them who have cultivated
their intellectual faculty, and have not destroyed it in themselves by the loves of self and
of the world. Another cause is, that the doctrine of that church cannot be acknowl
edged, nor consequently received, except by those who have not confirmed themselves
in doctrine, and at the same time in life, in faith alone ; confirmation in doctrine only
does not hinder reception, but if it be at the same time in life it does hinder, for such
persons do not know what love to the Lord is, nor what neighborly love or charity is,
neither are they willing to know. The third cause is, that the New Church on earth
increases according to its increase in the world of spirits, for spirits from thence are with
men, and they are from those who were in the faith of their church, whilst they lived
on earth, and no others of them receive the doctrine, but those who were in the spir
itual affection of truth, such only are conjoined to heaven, where that doctrine is, and
conjoin heaven to man : the number of those in the spiritual world now increases daily,
wherefore according to their increase, the church which is called the New Jerusalem
increases on earth. These also were the causes, why the christian church, after the
Lord left the world, increased so slow in Europe, and did not arrive to its full until an
age had elapsed." —Apoc. Expl. 733.

we deem that Swedenborg, in his supernatural function as Seer, has poured a
flood of light —that he has not only unveiled the phenomena of the life to come,
but has developed its philosophy also—that he has fully shown how and why it
is that the condition of spirits is what it is. In executing this great mission he
has moreover with a somewhat stern, but benevolent fidelity, rent away the
coverings which concealed from itself the hidden gangrene—the wasting corrup
tion—that was preying upon the vitals of the church in the omni-prevalence of
the Solifidian tenet and the absence of true living charity. This he has done,
not in order to give the enemy occasion to say, " Aha ! aha !" —not to glory over
her infirmities —but to indicate and administer the only remedy —to point her to
the true physician and to put her in quest of the healing balm.
What now, is the true answer to all this ! Must it not be either the admission
or the denial of the soundness of the grounds on which our assertions are
made ? Here are plain and emphatic assumptions which we are prepared to de
fend, and on the truth or falsehood of which we claim to be met. We see no
argument in the mere holding up our positions so as to excite a horrified won
der at the effrontery which could dare thus to array itself against the universal
sense or sentiment of the Christian world. But it seems you would turn the
matter to an argumentative account by showing that the results have not been
at all adequate to the large and lofty pretensions set forth.
" But I ask, what the men of the church have done- There has been ample time
surely, for some of the expected effects of the New Dispensation to appear. The
leaven has had almost a century to work. But what has been the result ? The
christian dispensation gave rise to great events during the life of the Apostles.
In a short time it changed the face of the world. But what has this new form
of Christianity done ? What important results have flowed from the introduction
of the New Church— which Swedenborg regarded as so superior to all preceding
dispensations ? What remarkable conversions —what instances of uncommon
piety, or uncommon usefulness has it produced ? What enterprises for the good
of the human race has it originated ? Where among the various plans which
have been pursued for the intellectual, civil, or moral improvement of the world,
can you perceive any traces of the special agency of Swedenborgians ? If they
have had the benefit of so much new light from heaven—
if,
as they think, the
all-powerful truths of religion, which have been concealed from the rest of the
world, have been revealed to them, and they have thus been distinguished above
all who have been called christians
;
we should have expected them to exert
a
distinguished influence in enlightening and saving their fellow-men. But where
can you trace the footsteps of such an influence
?
Historians, who have been
enemies to the Puritanism which sprung up and prevailed in England, have been
compelled to acknowledge
it
as the great cause which operated in favor of civil
liberty. But what respectable historian has referred to Swedenborgianism, as a
cause which has operated in favor of any important public object
?
Christianity,
accomplished wonders at its very beginning. But what has this new form of
Christianity accomplished in a hundred years
?
The men of the church were to
be different men, more free, more spiritual, more completely under the influence
of truth and love. But who among them, either here or in other lands, has in
these respects, been distinguished above all other christians
?
I
ask not, who
among them has possessed sincere piety
;
but who has risen to the pretended
pre-eminence

Who has attained to
a
higher degree of spirituality, to
a
more
fervent devotion, or
a
more enlarged and active benevolence, than multitudes of
ministers of the gospel and private christians in the Protestant churches of Eu

?
And yet all these, according to the strange notions of Swe
denborg, are to be excluded from the list of enlightened, spiritual Christians,
and to be looked upon as destitute of

the truths of faith and the goods of char
ity.'"— p. 24.

It cannot fail to be seen that a certain air of triumphant interrogation pervades
this paragraph. The questions asked are evidently asked under the confident
impression that they cannot be answered. What, now, will you say should
we even consent to abide by the test here propounded to us ? What if we should
not only claim all that is thus virtually denied to our system, but all that is in
effect challenged to yours, in the way of the extraordinary forth-putting of be
nevolent zeal and active effort during the period specified ? You speak of " re
markable conversions" —of " instances of uncommon piety or usefulness" —of
" enterprizes originated for the good of the human race" —of " various plans
pursued for the intellectual, civil, or moral improvement of the world"—all
which you would doubtless rank among the striking features of the age, and
yet among which you discern no perceptible traces of the agency of this " new
form of Christianity." Now granting the main assumption, that various moral
movements of a high order have distinguished the last eighty or ninety years, in
which the leading branches of the present Christian church have bome the
most prominent part, I yet venture the assertion that the system of the New
Church may justly claim the credit of the whole, for that system professes to
embody a revelation of the causes to which the distinguishing character of the
era in question is owing. Whatever may be said of the active personal partici
pation of New Churchmen in these movements, I scruple not to affirm that the
system which they have embraced contains within itself the prime moving
springs of the entire machinery of benevolence and action to which you would
doubtless point as the crowning glory of our age. If that system is true, the
sublime event of the Lords' Second Coming entered on its incipiency about the
middle of the last century, and it is to this epoch that the grand revelation to
which you allude is referred as its announcement. We recognize therefore in
the relation of our system to these stupendous changes, civil, intellectual, and
moral, the relation of cause and effect. They are precisely such results as we
were taught to anticipate, though their occurrence is as truly independent of our
personal ostensible agency as the revolution of the heavenly bodies, in accord
ance with Newton's great law of gravitation, is independent of his scientific an
nunciations of their periods. The celestial spheres roll on under the impulse of
their own laws regardless of his predictions however accurate. The hoop with
which he may have played in childhood bears no more proportion to the im
mense orbits which his calculus afterwards measured, than do the puny efforts
of the men of the New Church to the grandeur of the issues that flow from the
truths and principles to which they have subjoined their credo.
" Christianity accomplished wonders at its very beginning. But what has this
new form of Christianity accomplished in a hundred years ?" Circumspice —as
the epitaph reads on the architects' tomb, when the query of the passing stran
ger is answered as to the monuments of his genius—look around on every side
and peruse the record of its achievements. The testimonies to the triumphs of
your faith are the living witnesses to those of ours.

REPLY TO DR. WOODS. 41
LETTER V.
Rev. and Dear Sib:
The subject to which you next approach is " the manner in which Sweden-
borg interprets the Scriptures." After remarking upon the prevalence, among
the early Christian fathers, and among some of the moderns, of an allegorizing or
spiritualizing style in expounding the sacred writings, in which the object is
not so much to ascertain what sense was in the mind of the writers, as how
many senses they could give to each passage—without, however, claiming a
divine authority for their interpretations —you observe that Swedenborg comes
forward with a claim to supernatural and infallible illumination, and that under
the promptings of this inspiration, " the ordinary and most tranquil movements of
his active, fervid spirit, exceed the highest flights of the allegorizing interpreters
who preceded him." You then go on to ask :
" What now are we to think of the lofty affirmation of Swedenborg, that the
whole Christian world was ignorant of the true spiritual sense of the word of
God, and filled with the grossest mistakes and 'falses' on the subject of religion,
until he was commissioned to give instruction ? Is such an affirmation entitled
to our belief ? Is it credible, that the revelation which God made under the for
mer and the latter economy, absolutely required another revelation from heaven,
to disclose its true meaning ? And was that other revelation made to Sweden
borg, and through him to the world, near the middle of the last century ? On all
essential points, the Scriptures of the Old and the New Testament appear to be
very plain. They were evidently designed for the benefit of the common peo
ple. And who can doubt that common people, and even children, have had all
the knowledge of them, which is essential to salvation ? We know that, except
in infancy, some right knowledge of divine truth, some spiritual discernment of
the things of religion, belong to all who are saved. To multitudes, in different
ages since the death of Christ, the word of God has been quick and powerful.
And this quickening word is found in the writings of those to whom Christ pro
mised the Holy Spirit, to guide them into all the truth ? The Spirit was promised
and given to the Apostles, not only to enlighten their own minds, but to qualify
them to teach others. And what is necessary to enable the common people
rightly to understand the teachings of the Apostles ? Not a new revelation from
heaven, but a new heart, a heart to receive and love the revelation already
made. The hearts of men are naturally blinded by sin. The Spirit subdues the
power of sin, and in that way removes the blindness, and opens the eyes to see
the light. The Apostle speaks of God's shining in the hearts of men. This has
been the common privilege of Christians in all ages. It was their privilege be
fore the time of Swedenborg, as much as since. It has been given them of God,
to discern spiritual things. True, they have not had Swedenborg's discernment.
They have not understood spiritual things, as he understood them. The Apostles
had the promise of being guided into all the truth. But did they ever understand
the word of God as Swedenborg did ? When and where did they give such in
terpretations of the Scriptures, as are found in his writings ? But it would be in
vain to propose such a question to any one who rejects all the Apostolic Epistles.
What those Epistles contain is now to be set aside, to make room for the revela
tions of the last century. And even as to what Swedenborg admitted to be the
word of God, a sense is to be apprehended and received, which is altogether dif
ferent from what plain, honest, pious men have ever apprehended, or would be
likely to apprehend, —a sense which never came into the mind of any one, be

another revelation from heaven, to disclose its true meaning." This you regard
as utterly beyond belief not only from the general ""plainness of the sacred writ
ings and their consequent adaptation to the wants of common people and child
ren, but from the fact, that the Holy Spirit was promised to the apostles to guide
them into all truth, and that under this guidance they have been enabled to utter
themselves quite intelligibly to the great mass of men. What need then of a
new revelation from heaven ? The grand requisite is not a new revelation, but
a new heart, " a heart to receive and love the revelation already made."
We should probably fall very little behind you in the deep conviction of the
necessity of a " new heart" to a right entertainment of the revelation already be
stowed. But this does not militate with the equally strong conviction, that
ends worthy of infinite wisdom and goodness may dictate the bestowment of
new light in regard to the interior genius and scope of the written Word. If,
for instance, we could suppose that there were in fact certain principles or
powers in our nature hitherto undetected, which laid an adequate foundation
for an interior or spiritual sense in the inspired writings, and yet that these prin
ciples or powers were such that they could not be fully developed without a
special illumination, is it not easily conceivable, that such an illumination would
be warranted by the important results to flow from it ? Does not the psychological
nature of man bear a distinct relation to the subject-matter of a divine revelation?
Is it in aught inconsistent with our best views of the perfections of the Deity to
believe, that he would interpose for the purpose of acquainting mankind with
the great truths of their inner constitution ? And if we suppose, moreover, that
this revelation could only be made by the unveiling of the state of the soul after
death, is it not conceivable —as it will readily be granted to be possible
—that some
individual of the race, suitably endowed, might be chosen for the purpose and
made the subject of a species of translation into the spiritual sphere, and that too
with the express design of his being qualified to impart the knowledge thus ob
tained to his fellow-men ? Now this is, in fact, the claim which is made in be
half of Swedenborg. It is contended that he has, by special illumination, laid
open the interior structure of the human spirit, and developed such laws and
principles as absolutely necessitate the conclusion that there must be an interior
or spiritual sense to the Word. He instructs us in the fact of an all-important
distinction between natural and spiritual thought —that angels and spirits, who
are all from the human race, come into a psychological condition, in the other
life, in which they necessarily receive spiritual ideas from natural expressions —
and that this spiritual sense is governed by laws as fixed and immutable as those
that prevail in the material universe. It is true, indeed, that this implies the ex
istence and the reading of the Word in the spiritual world as well as in this, but
such he affirms to be the fact, though it is often read by spirits in our minds,
while we ourselves are reading
it,
and the evidence he affords in regard to this
fact, entitles him, in our belief, to the utmost credit. We grant, moreover, that

infancy, some right knowledge of divine truth, some spiritual discernment of the
things of religion, belong to all who are saved." Still we hold that the recogni
tion of this internal sense is clear and definite according as the principles on
which it is founded are intelligently apprehended, which is usually the result of
a familiar converse with Swedenborg's writings.
I would now submit whether the view thus presented can be justly charged
with anything like disparagement to the existing divine revelation. The devel
opment claimed is that of a recondite meaning in the Word, which stands in
direct relation to a parallel development in the psychological nature of man. In
its true character it is not, with the exception of the first few chapters of Genesis,
the abolishing or superseding of the literal or historical sense which has always
been assigned to the sacred record. It is simply an advance upon, or a super-
addition to, that sense, and what objection can there be to a new revelation of
the inner meaning of the Word, when it is in effect but a new revelation of a con
stituent principle of our nature, to which that meaning has a special relation ?
You will read in what I have now said, an answer to your queries respecting
the apostles. " They," you remark, " had not Swedenborg's discernment.
They have net understood spiritual things as A* understood them. The apostles
had the promise of being guided into all the truth. But did they ever understand
the word of God as Swedenborg did ? When and where did they give such in
terpretations of the Scriptures as he did ?" Undoubtedly no where. But what
then ? Does it follow from this that his interpretations are not true ? Does " all
the truth" into which they were to be guided comprise every form and depart
ment of truth—astronomical, geological, and psychological ? Did Paul interpret
the first chapter of Genesis as Lyell, and Silliman, and Hitchcock, and the mass
of modern divines, interpret them ? Did he understand the sun and moon's stand
ing still at the command of Joshua as Newton understood
it,
and as you and
I
understand
it
?
Does not the progress of science, as
it
evolves from age to age,
compel an altered construction of the letter of holy writ on a variety of subjects?
Can any solid reason be assigned why the progress of Anthropology should not
produce the same effect
?
May not a fuller development of the internal powers
and faculties of the human soul require a new construction of the literal purport
of a multitude of passages in the sacred books
?
Is
the clear and conclusive ex
pose of the constitution of our nature in these respects
a
virtual disparagement
of the Bible in its present form and its hitherto established interpretation
?
Is
it
justly chargeable upon the modern Astronomy and Geology that they do in effect
impeach the pious of former ages of gross ignorance on this head
?
Were those
holy men responsible for not knowing what they could not know in the circum
stances in which they were placed
?
And so as to the great psychological truths
which Swedenborg has developed —are he and his adherents to be loaded with
obloquy because they claim the possession of
a
knowledge, on this score, which
was no more in the reach of the apostles than the results of the modem sciences
of Astronomy, Geology, and Chemistry
?
Is
it

44 REPLY TO DR. WOODS.
The fact is, it is beyond question that Swedenborg's assertion of a spiritual
sense in the Word flows directly from his disclosures of the spiritual nature of
men as vouchsafed to him in his converse with the world unseen. Accordingly
the only effectual mode of refuting it is, by impugning the credibility of his re
lations on that head. This you are prompted to do by contrasting Paul's mod
est silence in respect to the things seen and heard by him in his rapture to the
third heavens with Swedenborg's voluminous recitals in his Memorabilia of ce
lestial and infernal wonders.
" Saint Paul had the privilege of visiting the third heavens, and of hearing and
seeing wonderful things there. But his modesty was such, that he was silent on
the subject for fourteen years, and never mentioned the fact which so distin
guished him above others, until he was compelled to do it in self-defence. And
men he mentioned it only once, and that hesitatingly, and with evident embar
rassment, and as though it belonged to another man. It is certain, that he did
nothing, in consequence of that revelation, in the way of teaching that new sense
of Scripture, or any of those new lessons, which we are now to learn from Swe-
denborg. And what can be the reason of this ? According to Swedenborg, the
angels have the Scriptures in their possession. Why did they not instruct Paul
in the true sense of the word of God > Is it to be supposed that they were then
ignorant of
it,
and that, by the diligent study of exegesis, they have since ac
quired the higher knowledge, which they communicated to the prophet of the
New Church
?
Or was
it
a fact, that Paul's visit in heaven was not long enough
to enable him to get an insight into the deeper mysteries of the Scriptures, and
that these mysteries were kept in reserve, till a man of more distinguished talents
and acquirements and
a
higher destiny should be raised up, and should have
the advantage of dwelling in the heavens for a long course of years, and should
thus have an opportunity, which Paul never had, to learn what no eye before
had seen, and no ear had heard, and no heart conceived ? Or did Paul,
if
sup
posed to have had information nearly equal to that of Swedenborg, still judge
it
proper to keep the more spiritual sense of Scripture which he had learned, a
profound secret
?
And did he judge thus, because he thought the human mind
not yet prepared to understand the sublimer mysteries of revelation
?
Or was
he so occupied with preaching the plain, literal sense of Scripture, and founding
churches, that he had no time to dive into deeper things
?
Or was his manner
of thinking and writing and speaking such, as not to be so well suited to things
of a celestial nature
>
Or were the languages which he used, that is, the Greek
and Hebrew, less adapted than the Latin, in which Swedenborg wrote, to the
more spiritual truths of the New Church
?
Or must we conclude that Paul's
judging
it
not lawful or possible to make known the things which he had heard,
was a mistake
?
There
is
certainly something very remarkable in this matter.
Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, who was commissioned to teach the truths con
tained in the Scriptures to Jews and Gentiles, and who was caught up to heaven
that he might be better qualified for his work, has not directly and expressly
given us any account of the particular things which he heard or saw, but says
only that they were unspeakable
;
while Swedenborg freely and fully relates the
familiar talk he had with the angels on all sorts of subjects. There was nothing
either impossible or inexpedient for him to utter. He could teach not only the
inner sense of what the Scriptures declare, but many things in addition —such
as the geography of the heavens, the north and the south, the east and the west,
the houses and the gardens, the fruits and the flowers, the different societies of
angels, the bodies and the clothing of dead men, their countenances, their limbs,
their senses, their caps and turbans, the marriages of men and women, &c,
although all was spiritual.
*

He could fill books with these matters, more
than four times as large as the Scriptures which he undertook to explain. In
regard to this whole affair, there certainly was a most noticeable difference be
tween him and the Apostle Paul
;
the latter being so modest and reserved as to
what he had heard in heaven, the former so surpassingly communicative
;
the
one referring to
it
only once, and that very reluctantly, and from necessity, and
in the person of another

ing visitation from God, which he calls a thorn in the flesh, to prevent his being
lifted up ; the other referring to the subject continually, and talking endlessly,
and with marvellous repetitions, about the great things and the little things
which he saw and heard in the other world, having had revelations so much
more abundant than Paul's that we should suppose that many thorns in the flesh
would have been necessary to prevent him from being exalted above measure."
—p. 30-34.
The scope of the reasoning throughout this paragraph is to set forth the
improbability of the spiritual sense of the Word being communicated to Sweden-
borg when it was withheld from Paul, notwithstanding that he too was privi
leged with admission to the celestial abodes. The implication is very plain,
that Swedenborg's claims are highly presumptuous when set by the side of those
of Paul. But it is certainly conceivable that the end to be answered by the tem
porary translation of one person into the sphere of spirits may be different from
that which was to be accomplished by the bestowment of the same privilege
upon another, and under totally different circumstances. The extatic vision of
Paul was evidently of very short duration, and, as far as appears from the nar
rative, was designed solely for his personal benefit, without reference to the in
struction of Christians, whereas Swedenborg's preternatural state was continued
to him for near thirty years, and that too, if he is to be believed, for the express
purpose of communicating the information thence derived to the world.
As, therefore, it does not appear that Paul's rapture was designed for any such
end as is claimed for Swedenborg's illumination, I see not that any inference
adverse to this claim can be fairly drawn from it. I am unable to perceive any
intrinsic necessity that a supernatural revelation alleged to have been made to
one person, at one age of the world, must be rejected as fabulous because not
made to another, at another age. The question is to be decided, as a question
of fact, upon its own appropriate evidence. If the possibility of such an occur
rence is foreclosed by any express declaration of Jehovah himself, then indeed
we are saved the necessity of any further inquiry on the subject. Nothing re
mains but to reject Swedenborg's pretended visions as an arrant imposture or a
pitiable delusion. But no intimation of the kind can be alleged from the sacred
Scriptures. Not the least hint is afforded that the Most High has shut himself
up from bestowing on his creatures new measures of revelation from the spirit
ual world.* For aught that is to be read in the Old Testament or the New, just
such disclosures maybe made to men as Swedenborg declares were made to him,
and if so it is impossible to deny that the fact of a spiritual sense pertaining to
* I should have been very glad, for one, if Mr. Barnes had given his authority for as
serting what follows in his note on 2 Cor. 12, 4 ; —" We have all the truth which wo
shall ever have about heaven here below. No other messenger will come ; none of the
pious dead will return. If men, therefore, are not willing to be saved in view of the
truth which they have, they must be lost. God will communicate no more." This is
evidently spoken without any design to include Swedenborg's disclosures in the general
body of truth to which he alludes, and to which we are to expect no additions from the
Most High himself. The assertion is plainly unwarranted. It is what no man can
affirm, in the absence of any divine declaration on the subject, unless he is prepared to
say that no adequate reatont can ever hereafter exist for the communication of new
truth to the world respecting heaven and hell and the life beyond death. It may, I
think, be seriously doubted, whether Mr. B. is in possession of a sufficient amount of
knowledge in respect to the divine counsels to enable him to make this assertion with
much confidence.

the Word may have entered into them, inasmuch as it rests upon the spiritual
nature of man, as unfolded to him in his state of translation, and which it was
a great part of his mission to develope to the world. That this sense should have
been made known to Paul, does not by any means follow, so long as it cannot
be shown that the end of his extacy was to enlighten him into the philosophy
of our being, instead of affording consolation and encouragement in the midst of
his severe trials as a Christian. Your long string of interrogatories, therefore,
bearing on this head seems quite irrelevant to the scope of the argument. They
can possess no force except from the antecedent probability, that if such a reve
lation as Swedenborg claims to have been made to himself were made at all, it
would have been made to Paul also, and this is but another form of maintaining
that Infinite Wisdom must necessarily make all its revelations at once, or in one
age, instead of observing the order of the gradual evolution of the human mind
and the different exigences of the race at different periods. If this be seriously
maintained, the whole controversy assumes a new aspect, and though I am
entirely willing to meet you on this ground, it is plainly inappropriate to the
object of the present discussion.
As the above objection founded upon the case of Paul has been very largely
and elaborately considered by Mr. Clissold in his Letter to Archbishop Whately,
1 beg leave to transcribe one or two paragraphs in this connection. " The
Essays refer us to the case of St. Paul. They speak of the celestial vision with
which he had been favored, and observe, that he alludes, with the utmost pos
sible brevity, to his being caught up into paradise and hearing unspeakable
words, without relating any particulars of the vision : this circumstance the rea
der is naturally led to contrast with Swedenborg's " copious and distinct revelations,"
his " visit to the celestial abodes," &c, of all which it is said " he gives minute
descriptions:" it is directly contrasted, likewise, with the narratives of Mahomed ;
and the Essays observe, —" It is truly edifying to compare this with Mahomed's
long and circumstantial description of his pretended visit to heaven, filled with
a multitude of needless particulars, calculated to gratify an appetite for the mar
vellous j" the narratives of Swedenborg being thus obviously classed with those
of Mahomed. Now, with regard to the minute descriptions of the celestial
abodes, pretended to be given by Swedenborg, pardon the liberty I take in ob
serving, that I am not aware that any such are to be found in any part of his
works. Swedenborg tells us that there are three heavens, the celestial, the spir
itual, and the natural ; and that of these, the third heaven or the highest is the
celestial, being the'same with that into which St. Paul declares he was caught
up. The celestial abodes are the abodes in the celestial heavens ; and into these
Swedenborg observes that he was rarely permitted to enter ; whence, so far from
giving long and minute descriptions upon this subject, he is silent with regard to
most of what he there saw and heard ; declaring, like St. Paul, that it would be
incomprehensible or incredible ; consequently, on the point upon which the
Essays have contrasted the writings of St. Paul with those of Swedenborg, there
is much more of remarkable coincidence than of contrast. With regard to the
abodes in the spiritual heavens, little is stated, compared with what Your Grace
justly observes an enthusiast or impostor would probably have done ; and what
is stated, is stated in a way, which, as I have already shown, and shall in the
sequel have further to show, renders it impossible for it to have come either from
an enthusiast or impostor. — Clissold's Letter, p. 122.

REPLY TO DR. WOODS. 47
He subsequently quotes the following passage from the Essays, which I here
introduce in order to make way for his reply. " But the Essays observe, '
It is
plain that nothing could have been more gratifying to the curiosity of all who
had an interest in the subject, nothing more likely even to allure fresh converts,
than a glowing description of the joys of heaven ; it would have been easily be
lieved, too, by those who gave credit to the writer, as it is plain Paul supposed
the Corinthians did ; it would have been very easy, again, for an impostor to give
loose to his fancy, in inventing such a description ; and to an enthusiast it would
have been unavoidable ; he who was passing off his day-dreams for revelations on himself
as well as on others, would have been sure to dream largely on such a subject. Why then
did not Paul do anything of the kind ! I answer, because he was not an impos
tor, nor an enthusiast, but taught only what had been actually revealed to him,
and what he was commissioned to reveal to others.'
" It is asked, why St. Paul did not do anything of the kind ? May I answer this
question by asking, '
Why is it that St. John did ?' But it will be said, St. John
did not give a full, minute, and engaging account. St. John wrote in types or
symbols, and a type will contain as much in a short compass, as, if explained,
volumes could comprise. Had Swedenborg given the symbols only, without
their explanation, he might, in most instances, have been as concise as the proph
ets. To draw the comparison fairly between the two, the interpretations of the
symbols in Scripture ought to be included ; and if this be done, the argument, I
presume, will be seen to be invalid. But the narratives of the prophets, it is
said, are not minute. Now T reply, that some, at least, appear to be quite as
minute as those of Swedenborg ; and this for a good reason. If the objects pre
sented to the spiritual vision be symbolical, then, for the purposes of interpreta
tion, a minute description of these objects is as necessary, as, for the same pur
poses, a minute transcript of a hieroglyphical sentence ; for if one hieroglyphic
were omitted, the meaning of the whole might be altered or left imperfect.
This we may see more particularly exemplified in St. John's description of the
New Jerusalem.
" Why, then, was St. Paul silent as to his vision in the third heaven ? Be
cause he was not commissioned to reveal to others what he had heard and seen.
Why was St. John not silent ? Because the Lord said to him, ' What thou seest
write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia.' The
question, therefore, I respectfully submit, does not depend upon any antecedent
views we may entertain of the propriety or impropriety of a full, minute, or en
gaging account ; but upon the fact of what the writers themselves actually saw,
and were divinely commissioned to reveal to others ; and, therefore, if the fore
going objection be in any manner urged against Swedenborg, it can be valid
only on the ground, that he never had any intercourse with the spiritual world,
or never had any divine commission to communicate what he saw, —which is
merely begging the question." —Id. p. 123 and 126.
To all this I would add that the original word by which Paul expresses the
" unlawfulness" of uttering what he heard and saw in the third heavens implies
also " impossibility," and in this intimation he agrees with Swedenborg who
frequently alludes to the incompetency of human language to convey any ade
quate idea of the wonderful things of the angelic heaven.

been made to him, you say, " we should suppose that many thorns in the flesh
would have been necessary to prevent him from being exalted beyond measure."
Now I would suggest it as possible, that there might have been an intrinsic
native difference in the characters of the two men which rendered necessary a
discipline in the one case that was not so much called for in the other. This
idea is perhaps favored by the verdict of Mr. Barnes (in loc.)
" There is abun
dant reason to believe that Paul was naturally a proud man. He was by nature
self-confident ; trusting in his own talents and attainments, and eminently ambi
tious. When he became a Christian, therefore, one of his besetting sins would
be pride ; and as he had been peculiarly favored in his call to the apostleship ;
in his success as a preacher ; in the standing which he had among the other
apostles, and in the revelations imparted to him, there was also peculiar danger
that he would become self-confident and proud of his attainment." —Barnes on
Cor. p. 354. If it be said that this could only be predicated of Paul's natural char
acter, and that he became entirely another man after his conversion, still it would
seem that the vicious taint in his spirit was not yet wholly removed —that it was
still lurking within him, even at the time when he was thus favored with admis
sion into heaven —and if we could suppose the bare possibility that it remained
with him to the last, and went with him into the spiritual world, it would
give at least a semblance of probability to what Swedenborg declares of his state
in that world, which is certainly very much in accordance with Mr. Barnes'
testimony cited above respecting him.
You are pleased, in this part of your work, to relieve the gravity of ab
stract discussion by reciting a "vision" of your own. Though dignified
with the title of " vision," to bring it somewhat more into parellelism with
those which you would ascribe to Swedenborg, I shall still venture to re
gard it as a dream, and that you found a warrant for the recital of it in the words
of Scripture, " he that hath a dream, let him tell a dream." It is thus related :—
" This difference between Paul and Swedenborg so impressed my mind a short
time since, that I too, in fact, had a vision. And yet, as I am not gifted in that
way at all like Swedenborg, my vision was quite moderate and tame compared
with the marvellous visions which came before his active and illuminated mind.
In the thoughts of my head upon my bed, when deep sleep falleth upon men, I
actually saw, very clearly and distinctly, my venerated friend, Dr. Dwight, and
conversed with him familiarly, as I used to do while he lived. Nor did it occur
to me, that he was dead, nor did he seem to know that he was not just as he had
been on earth. I said to him, ' Dr. Dwight, I have lately been reading the ac
count which Swedenborg gives of what he saw and heard in heaven, particu
larly the revelations made to him of the inner sense of the Scriptures. The
Apostle Paul was once translated into heaven. But it seems that fourteen years
passed away before he made any mention of that distinguished privilege of his.
And although he was doubtless wonderfully enlightened and confirmed in the
principles of Christianity by that celestial vision, he did not attempt to tell the
world the things which he had seen and heard, saying, that they were unspeak
able. But Swedenborg tells hundreds of long stories, giving the particulars of
the free conversations he had with the angels for many years, and describing the
spiritual meaning of Scripture which he there learned, and the various objects he
saw in different parts of the upper world. Is there not, in all this, a most re
markable difference between Swedenborg and the Apostle Paul ?' Dr. Dwight
gravely replied,
' there surely is.'"—p. 34.

swer, and it affords me pleasure to believe that he had, in all probability, attained
to a very correct understanding of the points in which the difference consisted.
I only regret that the dialogue closed so abruptly, and that you had not the op
portunity of inquiring of him whether there were not amply sufficient reasons for
the difference in the two cases. Should the " vision" ever chance to be repeated,
I could fain hope that the conversation might be resumed just at the point where
it was broken off.
But leaving Paul and Dr. Dwight you return to the consideration of the spiritual
sense of the Word. In alluding to my advocacy of Swedenborg you say, that I
do not avail myself of the circumstance of his supernatural illumination as a
proof of his principles —that my reliance is chiefly, if not wholly, on the nature of
those principles —that to vindicate Swedenborg's writings, I appeal to conscious
ness, to psychological facts, which I esteem clear and certain— all which is un
doubtedly true, and you thus make up the issue.
" What better, then, can I do, than to show you, by a sufficient number of
specimens, in what manner our author interprets that portion of the Bible, which
he receives as the word of God, and then to refer the whole to your sober judg
ment. My examples will be derived from the first volume of his Heavenly Ar
cana, and his work on the Apocalypse." —p. 35.
You accordingly proceed to a somewhat extended analysis of the expositions,
contained in the Arcana, of several of the first chapters of Genesis, with the view
to hold up his spiritual mode of interpreting this portion of the book, in revolting
contrast with what you deem the more consistent and rational mode of literal in
terpretation. You then go on to say ;
*'
You will keep in mind, that this mode of allegorizing or spiritualizing Scrip
ture is now presented before you for your sober consideration. The appeal is to
your reason and common sense. The question to be decided is, whether there
is internal evidence of the truth of these interpretations. This is the question
proposed to us by Professor Bush. He does not wish us to rely upon the au
thority of Swedenborg as an inspired man, but to look at the intrinsic excellence
of what his writings contain. Is it then obvious to reason and common sense,
that the account of the creation, above referred to, was intended to convey such
a meaning as Swedenborg supposes?" —p. 38.
Substantially the same queries, somewhat varied in form, repeatedly occur in
different parts of your work and as I hope to propound an answer that will cover
the whole ground, I will here cite some of the principal passages.
"If all this were a matter of direct revelation from God, then we should be
bound, as Christians, to believe it. But, according to Professor Bush, we are to
look for an intrinsic reasonableness and excellence in these explanations of the
word of God. But we look in vain. Reason and common sense can see noth
ing in such explanations but groundless and extravagant fancies. Reason
searches for the grounds of any opinion ; it is very much inclined to inquire for
the why, and the wherefore. And in the present case, it would like to ask, why does
the river Pison signify the intelligence of faith from love ? And why does Gihon
signify the knowledge of all things relating to faith and love ? Wht is it that the
first relates to the will, and the second to the understanding ? Why does Hiddekel
signify reason, and Euphrates, science ?" —p. 43.
'' Clissold, one of the ablest advocates of Swedenborg, speaking of the truth of
the revelation of the internal sense of the Word as unfolded by Swedenborg, says, '
the
evidence of it stands upon its own basis.' I suppose he means the same as Professor
Bush means, when he so frequently asserts, that in judging of Swedenborg's

principles, we are to look at their intrinsic excellence —that the appeal is to be
made to reason, common sense, and consciousness. Now I inquire of reason,
or common sense, why these interpretations are adopted, and why, in any case,
one of them is adopted rather than another? Professor Bush says, 'the system
of Swedenborg insists upon such an interpretation of the word as shall accord
with the fair and unimpeachable conclusions of reason, with the known laws,
facts and principles of nature, and with internal consciousness.' I ask then, do
Swedenborg"s interpretations agree with this standard ? As the appeal is to be
made to reason, and reference to be had solely to the intrinsic reasonableness
and excellence of Swedenborg"s writings; then, of course, we are not to be in
fluenced by the authority which he claims as a divinely commissioned interpret
er of the Scriptures. If, however, the reason to which the appeal is to be made,
means the illuminated reason of the man of the New Church ; then the reason of
others can have nothing to do with the matter, and the question would be why
any others are called upon to judge." —p. 55.
" The question returns, and returns times without number, —what is there in
reason, or consciousness, or common sense, or philosophy, or philology, which
could lead to such interpretations of the word of God, or which can justify us in
receiving them ? Is there anything in the language itself, which indicates such
a meaning ? Is there anything in other parts of Scripture, or in the nature of the
subjects introduced, which demands a spiritual or allegorical sense of what is
contained in the chapters of Genesis above-mentioned ? Are not the things re
lated from the 5th to the 13th chapters as credible, as those related in the sub
sequent parts of the Bible, or in any other ancient history ? And may we not as
properly say, that all history, and all the events which take place, are to be in
terpreted spiritually, and have an inner sense, according to the system of corres
pondences ? And then how shall we make out the correspondences ? Shall
we look for internal evidence ? Shall we rely upon the intuitions of the reason ?
No. We must follow Swedenborg. But how did Swedenborg proceed ? How
did he happen to think that the six days work in the creation denote the six
states of a man passing through the process ofregeneration —that sun, moon and
stars signify love and faith—birds, things intellectual —creeping things, scientifics,
&c. ? How did he happen to think of all these wonderful arcana, which no man,
uninspired or inspired, ever thought of before the year 1747 ? How did he hap
pen to think of these things ? Why, the angels told him" —p. 57.
Now in reply to all this, and much more like
it,
I
still adhere to the position,
that
it
rests upon principles which appeal to reason and consciousness. But
what are these principles
?
They are those by which the truth of Swedenborg's
general claim
is
to be determined.
I
have no where intimated that the sound
ness of his interpretations is, in all cases, intuitively apparent, or that
it
is
con
firmed by direct internal evidence. Far from it. Indeed he very frequently gives
us to understand, that the latent spiritual sense, in a multitude of passages,
is
by
no means obvious from the sense of the letter, and that
it
does not come to the
perception of one who
is
not acquainted with the fundamental law on which
it
rests. The discovery and announcement of this law
is
the main feature of his
claim, and
I
say that the truth of
it
is
to be determined at the tribunal of reason
and consciousness.
It
is
a
law which he affirms to result from the constitution
of the human mind.
It
is
a grand psychological fact, and though he professes
to have received the knowledge of
it
by means of admission into the world of
spirits, yet as this will be granted to be possible, the evidence of its reality
is
ap
prehensible by the exercise of our natural faculties, and we have no hesitation
to say that the evidence
is
sufficient to satisfy any candid mind that will ade
quately weigh it. We are competent to judge, from the data presented, whether
the structure of the human mind
is
what he affirms
it
to be, and this we do by
comparing the dictates of our reason and consciousness with his averments. He

distinctly asserts that the spiritual sense of the Word grows out of the spiritual
nature of man —that just in proportion as this nature is developed an interior
sense is recognized under the veil of the letter,—and that the law of corres
pondence between natural and spiritual things is the law which guides and
governs the interpretation of the language employed in the inditing of the Scrip
tures. If, for instance, Swedenborg gives me good reasons to believe that he
had good reasons for asserting, that by the law of correspondence the word
" earth" or " land" signifies, to a spiritual perception, the church —that " horse"
signifies the understanding, and " water" truth —that a " tree" signifies perception,
and a " sword " combat of truth with falsity —I see not why I should refuse to ac
cept these interpretations, even though I may be unable myself, for the present,
to perceive distinctly in what manner they flow from the asserted law. He af
firms, that the terms " earth," " horse," " water," " tree," " sword," when under
stood according to the letter, convey natural ideas, whereas such is the nature of
angels and spirits that they necessarily receive from these very terms spiritual
ideas, and what these are he professes to state from the wisdom imparted to him
when elevated to the sphere of angelic intelligence. He informs us, moreover,
that the paramount principle of correspondence or analogy affords us a valid
reason why such and such natural terms convey such and such spiritual ideas,
and no others.
The opponents of Swedenborg can never, with the least semblance of fairness,
evade the obligation of studying, weighing, and pronouncing upon his doctrine
of correspondence. It is the very heart, and soul, and centre of the system.
Until this doctrine is looked full in the face, the true genius of the system is not
even approached by the assailant. One might as well essay the refutation of
Newton's theory of the universe without alluding to the law of gravitation. Yet
where has this been done by a single writer who has entered the lists against
him ? I look in vain through the ranks for an isolated instance where it seems
to have been even understood. The warfare is waged on entirely other grounds.
Judge then how little his defenders would be apt to be affected by the reasonings
of his adversaries. How can they feel their force when they are conscious that
their main position is not only not reached, but not perceived —it does not even
come into sight. And yet this is not to be charged to the intrinsic obscurity of
the principle in itself considered. It is no unintelligble proposition, that every
thing natural exists and subsists from a spiritual origin —that the human body,
for instance, is not created immediately, but is elaborated from the soul or spirit
with which it corresponds in structure, form, and expression —that, in like man
ner, the whole material universe is the product of the spiritual universe, and
not of the immediate and direct fiat of Omnipotence —that every single object in
nature is thus the effect of a spiritual cause with which it corresponds, especially as
to use, which is, in the spiritual world, really prior to the material embodiment
in the natural world* —and that the natural language appropriate to the expres-

sion of natural objects suggests to the spiritual mind the spiritual ideas with
whichsuch objects correspond. As the human hand, for example, is an elaboration
of the executive faculty or power of the soul, and thus corresponds with
it,
as an
effect corresponds with its cause, so the term hand legitimately conveys the idea
of power, not by any arbitrary or merely metaphorical usage, but in virtue of a
fixed, definable, and invariable law. And so of a thousand other things. Accord
ing to Swedenborg's profound philosophy, the spiritual world
is
the world of
causes, and just in proportion as the mind
is
elevated above the sphere of the
corporeal and the sensual,
it
comes into the sphere of causes and understands the
language
of
cautes, which
is
the language of correspondences. The great question to
be determined in the outset
is
whether the principle
is
a sound one. If
I
am
satisfied on this head,
I
have ample grounds,
I
conceive, for resting in full as
surance as to the correctness of the specific applications which he makes of it.
For why should he be empowered to lay open the law, unless he was qualified,
at the same time, to show how it bears, in its details, upon the exposition of
particular passages
?
Now of
a
multitude of such explanations as you have cited, you remark, that
" reason and common sense can see nothing in them but groundless and ex
travagant fancies. Reason searches for the grounds of any opinion
;
it
is
very
much inclined to inquire for the why and the wherefore. Why does the river
Pison signify the intelligence of faith and love, &c. ?" Permit me to say, in reply,
that the real point at issue
is
not, in the first instance, whether Swedenborg af
fords you at once a clear intellectual perception of the truth of the meanings
which he assigns to particular terms, but whether he affords you sufficient rea
son for believing in the existence of the law which he affirms, and for confiding
in him as duly qualified to apply it. The fundamentals of any system take
precedence of its details, and the great question here
is
in regard to the funda
mental law of the spiritual sense.
It
certainly goes not a little in support ot
Swedenborg's position that the general principle
is
practically recognized in the
spiritual sense given, as
it
were, spontaneously to such terms as "Zion," "Ca
naan," " Jerusalem," " Babylon
,"
&c. in the employment of which the mind does
not dwell upon the topographical import of the words, but passes by a natural
transition to an abstract or spiritual sense. In order then to grasp the ra
tionale of Swedenborg's internal sense, you have but to conceive the process by
which your own mind passes from the literal to the spiritual sense of the word
"Zion," for instance, when in prayer you implore the Most High that he would
" bless his Zion." Literally understood " Zion"
is
the name of
a
part of the an
cient city of Jerusalem, but you certainly do not use
it
in prayer in such a sense.
So also with such terms as " temple," " altar," " laver," fee,
it
is
seldom that they
are used under the gospel economy except as a kind of external covering for
certain spiritual ideas familiar to all Christians. These instances are sufficient
are their first principles. They who are in divine ideas never subsist in the objects of
external sight, but continually, from them and in them, behold things internal
;
and in
ternal things are, most essentially, those of the Lord's kingdom
;
consequently, these
are in the veriest end of all. The case
is
similar in regard to the Word of the Lord:
they who are in divine ideas never regard the Word of the Lord from the letter, but con
sider the letter, and the literal sense, as representative and significative of the celestial
and spiritual things of the church and of the Lord's kingdom. With them the literal
sense
is
only an instrumental means of thinking concerning those things." —A. C. 1807.

to illustrate the general principle, psychologically considered, and to show the
possibility of what Swedenborg affirms to be the truth —that to the perception of
angels the whole Word is so constructed, as that an interior spiritual purport is
couched under the natural forms of expression of which human language is
composed.* At the same time, he remarks that this interior sense is not always
equally remote from the literal. In some cases it is coincident with
it,
in others
it
recedes but slightly from
it,
and
it
may in this respect be compared to some
of the rock strata of the earth, which for the most part are deeply concealed in
the interior, but occasionally, as geologists term
it,
crop out on the surface.f
But this whole subject of the spiritual sense
of
the Word forms such an important
feature in Swedenborg's system, and he
is
himself so incomparably the ablest
expositor of his own doctrines, that
I
shall cite rather freely from his pages in
order to present the matter in its true light. Nothing can be more evident from
the paragraphs which follow than that the great question involved
is
a question
of psychological fact, and that not hermeneutics merely, but metaphysics also,
is
concerned in the refutation of the doctrine. You will doubtless admit that
there
is
a philosophy of some kind in the usage, to which
I
have adverted, in re
gard to certain terms familiar in all Christian discourse.
It
remains to be seen
whether the same philosophy will not sustain Swedenborg's doctrine on this
head.
The first extract
I
shall give
is
from the " Spiritual Diary," where, in
a
section
headed, " That Heaven does not see names and words, but things," he remarks,
" From those things which have been before said concerning spirits,
it
is
evi
dent that corporeal things must first be put off, and, indeed, with various pains,
and thus given to death. Afterwards natural things adhering to spiritual things,
for such a nature cannot enter heaven. At length there remains in the spirit or
mind, what is spiritual and celestial. As, therefore, corporeal and natural
things, which in themselves are dead, must be put off before the soul can enter
heaven,
it
is
most manifestly evident that heaven can never hear nor understand
those things which are in words, and which are corporeal and natural, but those
things which are spiritual, celestial, and divine
;
thus which are remote, more
remote, and most remote from the literal sense. As when
a
man thinks more
sublimely than usual, he cares nothing about the words, but only about the sense
arising from the words, and from the proximate sense he concludes respecting
a superior or more sublime sense. Hence
it
is
absurd to think that heaven hears
and understands the Word according to the letter, or that
it
understands the
names of men, women, cities, and the like, since heaven
is
in the sense of things
which lie concealed within the Word. The sense of the letter does not proceed
beyond the expression, or sound of the ear, consequently not beyond the body."
— Spir. Diary, 612.
* "Whatever
is
written in the Word, in itself and in its essence
is
spiritual. That
the Word
is
spiritual
is
known, but its spiritual does not appear in the letter, for in the
letter
it
is worldly, especially in the historical parts
;
but when
it
is
read by man, the
worldly which
is
therein, becomes spiritual in the spiritual world, that is, with the an
gels
;
for they cannot think otherwise than spiritually of each thing contained in it.
To think spiritually
is
to think of those things which are of the Lord's Kingdom, thus
of those things which are of the Church." —A. C. 4480.

" We have compared the letter of the Word of God to the skin that covers the
body, and its hidden contents to the interior organs and members
;
but to illustrate the
present subject, the Holy Word may be compared to a beautiful female, clothed in be
coming drapery, but whose face and hands remain uncovered
:
thus, while the greater
part of the letter of the Scriptures consists of truths veiled over by natural images, which
cannot be deciphered without a key, the things most indispensable to be known are
openly displayed." —Noble's Plen. Inspir. p. 115.

64 REPLY TO DR. WOODS.
Here we have the assertion of a principle pertaining to our interior constitution
which at once connects itself with the law of the spiritual sense of the Word.
It is an affirmation upon which our reason and consciousness must decide.
Have we adequate grounds, from what we know of ourselves and from rational
deductions thence, to conclude that such is, in fact, the structure and working
of the human mind ? If not, the question, I think, will be very apt to come up—
as I am sure it ought —how such a theory should ever have occurred to its pro-
pounder ? How came Swedenborg to think of it ? To a considerate mind there
is a problem here which demands solution, for it is a principle as profound as
novel, and carrying with it an air of the highest probability. And let me here
remark, that in nothing am I more surprised than in witnessing the apparently
slight impression made upon the mass of even thinking men by the intrinsic
character of Swedenborg's psychology. How is it possible that they should not
recognize its claims to the deepest consideration ? Do they feel assured of rest
ing in a philosophy more rational, more plausible, more certain ? Why do they
not feel the pressure of the demand to account for the stupendous inconsistency
of such philosophy as his coexisting with, and emanating from, a deranged in
tellect ? Has anything ever yet presented itself to the world more worthy of en
lightened inquiry ? Yet alas, with what amazing facility and apathy is this
question pretermitted ? It is not usually very difficult to recognize such ideas as
are evidently in advance of the general state of the human mind at any particular
period of its progress. We have a certain instinctive perception of whatever
transcends, in any marked degree, the ordinary standard of thought, and when
results are announced which plainly outreach this measure, we behold an effect
for which we naturally demand the cause. It presents a problem which the ex
isting data do not enable us to solve. This remark applies, I think, with pecu
liar force to the psychological system of Swedenborg. It is impossible for one
to have mastered it in its details without his being struck with its palpable diver
sity from all previous systems, and we look in vain to all the varied influences
bearing upon the man, from his earliest years, to afford a clew to the phenome
non. If we content ourselves with the supposition of a native intellect of high
order—combining originality, vigor, penetration, and wideness of grasp in rare
union —still the products of this genius so immeasurably surpass all that could
have been anticipated from merely natural endowments, that the idea of the
supernatural in their origination does scarcely any more violence to our impres
sions. The urgency of the demand, however, for some rational mode of solving
the multitudinous problems that distinguish the case of Swedenborg is, I am
satisfied, beginning to be felt both deeply and widely, and no amount of angry
opposition or polemical protest can much longer stave off the issue which the
philosophical mind of the age must make with these amazing developments.
But I proceed with my citations illustrative of the principle of the spiritual
sense. In the following passage he still farther shows how it is that proper names
lose their distinctive character to a spiritual perception.
"The names of men, of kingdoms, and of cities, which occur in the Word, in
like manner as the expressions of human speech, perish at the first beginning of
the ascent, for they are earthly, corporeal, and material, which are successively
put off by souls that come into the other life, and altogether by those that come
into heaven. The angels do not retain the least idea of any person mentioned
in the Word, nor, consequendy, of his name. What Abram is, what Isaac, and

Jacob, they no longer know, forming to themselves an idea from those things
which, in the Word, are represented and signified by them. Names and vocal
espressions are like earthly coverings, or scales, which fall off when they enter
into heaven. Hence it may appear, that by names, in the Word, are signified
nothing else than things; concerning which I have frequently discoursed with
the angels, and have been fully instructed by them as to the truth. The speech
of spirits among themselves is not a speech of words, but of ideas, such as are
those of human thought independent of words : wherefore it is the universal of
all languages : but when they speak with man, their speech falls into the words
of man's language." —A. C. 1876.
" Names, countries, nations, and the like, are not at all known to those who
are in heaven ; they have no idea of such things, but of the realities signified
thereby. It is from the internal sense that the Word of the Lord lives, this sense
being like the soul, of which the external sense is as it were the body ; and the
case with the Word is as with man ; when his body dies, then his soul lives, and
when the soul lives, then he is no longer acquainted with the things that relate
to the body : thus when he comes amongst the angels, he knows not what the
Word is in its literal sense, but only what it is in its soul. Such was the man of
the Most Ancient Church; were he living at this day on earth, and were he to
read the Word, he would not at all remain in the sense of the letter, but it would
be as if he did not see it, but only the internal sense abstracted from the letter,
and this in such a manner as if the letter had no existence ; thus he would dwell
in the life or soul of the Word. The case is the same with every part of the
Word, even with the historicals, which are altogether such as they are related ;
but yet not even the minutest word is given, which does not in the internal sense
involve arcana, which never become apparent to those who keep their attention
fixed on the historical context." —A. C. 1143.
I must of course be aware that the intrinsic truth of this cannot be expected to
flash, as it were, upon the mind of every reader at once ; but I still believe that
when deliberately weighed, it will commend itself as in the highest degree
rational and probable, for in the process above adverted to by which such words
as " Zion," " Canaan," " Babylon," &c., lose their original import to a spiritual con
ception, we have a sample of the operation of precisely the same law. And so
also the following, which rests upon essentially the same principle. The pas
sage explained is Gen. six. 2, " In the morning ye shall rise up early and go on
your way."
" From this, as from other passages, it is evident how remote the internal sense
is from the sense of the letter, and hence how unseen, especially in the histori
cal parts of the Word ; and that it is not made manifest, unless each particular
expression be explained according to its constant signification in the Word.
Wherefore when the ideas are kept confined in the sense of the letter, the internal
sense appears no otherwise than as something obscure and dark ; but on the
other hand, when the ideas are kept in the internal sense, the jsense of the letter
appears in like manner obscure, yea, to the angels as nothing ; for the angels
are no longer in worldly and corporeal ideas, such as appertain unto man, but
in spiritual and celestial ideas, into which the expressions of the sense of the
letter are wonderfully changed, whilst that sense ascends from man, who reads
the Word, to the sphere in which the angels are, that is, to heaven, and this from
the correspondence of things spiritual with things worldly, and of things celestial
with things corporeal ; which correspondence is most regular and constant, but
never as yet fully opened as to its quality, only now in the explication of expres
sions, of names, and numbers, according to their internal sense in the Word. In
order to show the nature of that correspondence, or what is the same thing, how
worldly and corporeal ideas pass into corresponding spiritual and celestial ideas,
when they are elevated into heaven, the expressions morning and way may serve
as examples; when morning is read, as in the verse before us, to rise in the
morning, the angels do not conceive an idea of any morning of a day, but an

idea of morning in a spiritual sense, thus similar to what was written in Samuel :
*
The rock of Israel, He is as the light of the morning, when the sun ariseth, a
morning without a cloud,' 2 Sam. xxiii. 4 : and in Daniel :
•
The Holy One sftid
unto me, even until evening, when the morning cometh, two thousand three
hundred,' viii. 14, 26; thus instead of morning they perceive the Lord, or his
kingdom, or the celestial things of love and charity, and this with a variety ac
cording to the series of things in the Word which is read. In like manner when
the term way occurs, as here, to go on your way, the angels cannot have any
idea of a way, but a spiritual or celestial one, like as in John; 'I am the way
and the truth,' xiv. 6 : and in David :
' 0 Jehovah, make known to me thy ways,
lead my way in truth,' Psalm xxv. 3, 4 : and in Isaiah ;
*
Thou hast caused him
to know the way of intelligences,' xl. 14. Thus instead of way they perceive
truth, and this, both in the historical and prophetical parts of the Word : for the
angels have no longer any concern about the historicals, inasmuch as such re
lations are not at all adequate to their ideas, wherefore instead thereof they per
ceive such things as are of the Lord, and his kingdom, which also are arranged
in a beautiful order, and connected series, in the internal sense; that the Word
might on this account also be for the angels, all the historical relations therein
are representative, and every expression significative of snch things as respect
the Lord and his kingdom, which circumstance is peculiar to the Word above
any other writing." —A. C. 2333.
Here we have the asserted sense in which the angels understand the terms-
"morning "and "way." It arises from the very nature of angelic ideas, which
always affix the same import to the same terms. Consequently so far as we
can rest in the soundness of these interpretations, we have at least the satis
faction of knowing that we read the Word in concert with the celestial intelli
gences, and how far this detracts from the interest or disparages the literal verity
of the inspired record, every reflecting mind can judge for itself. The only ob
jection which I can conceive as being urged against it is, that we have no suffi
cient evidence that such are the ideas of the angels, and this is but another
form of denying the fact of Swedenborg's illuminated insight into the things of
the spirit-world. If this, however, is denied it must be upon other grounds than
his developments of the philosophy of the spiritual sense, for there is nothing ia
this that intrinsically goes to militate with his claim, as there is nothing in it in
trinsically unreasonable or absurd—nothing which we might not easily admit,
provided we saw reason to believe in the reality of the vision upon which he
affirms its existence. The proof of this is not the present object of discussion.
We shall be better prepared for it in the sequel.
A very important principle in the spiritual interpretation of the Word grows
out of the fact that the spiritual world according to Swedenborg is replete with
representative objects, which are at the same time significant, and as these objects im
mediately suggest to the beholding spirits the things emblematically set forth by
them, or, in the Kantian phrase, as the phenomena intuitively call to mind the
noumena, so the names which designate such objects in the inspired Word sum
mon up to the spiritual mind the spiritual realities for which they stand. This
is strikingly illustrated, both as to principle and application, in what follows.
" When man's interior sight is opened, which is the sight of his spirit, then
there appear the things of another life, which cannot possibly be made visible to
the sight of the body. The visions of the prophets were nothing else. There
are in heaven, as was said above, continual representatives of the Lord and of
his kingdom; and there are also significatives ; insomuch that nothing at all ex
ists before the sight of the angels, which is not representative and significative.
Hence are the representatives and significatives in the Word ; for the Word is
through heaven from the Lord. —A. C. 1619.

REPLY TO DR. WOODS. 97
" It may appear surprising to every one, that the animals mentioned in the
Word, and also those offered in sacrifices, should signify goods and truths, or
what is the same, things celestial and spiritual, but it is permitted to state in a
few words whence this is. In the world of spirits various representatives are ex
hibited, and frequently there appear before the eyes of spirits animals, as horses
with various trappings, oxen, cows, lambs, and divers other kinds, sometimes
such as were never seen on the earth, but are only representatives ; such things
were also seen by the Prophets, as they are recorded in the Word, which like
wise were from thence. The animals which appear there, are representative of the
affections of good and truth, and also of evil and the false : good spirits know
perfectly well what they signify, and also collect thence what is the subject of
discourse amongst the angels, for the discourse of the angels, when it flows down
into the world of spirits, is sometimes thus exhibited in representatives. As, for
example, when horses appear, the good spirits know that the discourse of the
angels is about things intellectual ; when oxen and cows appear, that it is about
natural goods; when sheep appear, that it is about rational goods and about
probity; when lambs, that it is about goods still more interior,and about inno
cence ; and so in other cases. Inasmuch as the men of the most ancient Church,
communicated with spirits and angels, and also had visions and dreams con
tinually like those of the Prophets, hence, as soon as they saw any beast,
the idea occurred to them what it signified. From them first arose representa
tives and significatives, which remained long after their times, and at length were
held in such veneration by reason of their antiquity, that men wrote by mere
representatives, and the books, which were not so written, were accounted of
no value, and if written within the Church, of no sanctity : hence, and from other
hidden causes, concerning which, by the Divine Mercy of the Lord, we shall
speak elsewhere, the books of the Word also were so written." —A. C. 2179.
" The reason why a mountain signifies the good of love, is, because in heav
en they dwell upon mountains who are principled in the good of love to the
Lord, and they who are principled in charity towards their neighbor upon hills,
or what amounts to the same, they who are of the Lord's celestial kingdom dwell
upon mountains, and they who are of his spiritual kingdom, upon hills, and the
celestial kingdom is hereby distinguished from the spiritual kingdom, that they
who belong to the former are principled in love to the Lord, and they who be
long to the latter in charity towards their neighbor ; hence it is that by a moun
tain is signified the good of love to the Lord. A further reason why this is ab
stractedly signified by a mountain, is, because all things which are in the inter
nal sense of the Word are spiritual, and spiritual things are to be understood
abstractedly from persons and places ; wherefore also the angels, inasmuch as
they are spiritual, think and speak abstractedly from such things, and thereby
they are in intelligence and wisdom, for an idea of persons and places bounds
the thought, inasmuch as it determines to those things, and thus limits it. Such
idea of the thought is properly natural, whereas an idea abstracted from persons
and places extends itself into heaven in every direction, and is no otherwise
bounded than as the sight of the eye whilst it views the heavens without being
obstructed by intervening objects, and such an idea is properly spiritual ; hence
it is that a mountain, in the spiritual sense of the Word, signifies the good of
love. The case is similar with respect to the signification of the earth, as denot
ing the church ; for an idea abstracted from places, and from nations and peo
ple on the earth, is that of the church on earth or with those who live on it ; and
this therefore is what is signified by earth in the Word. The case is similar with
other things, which are mentioned in the natural sense of the Word, as with hills,
rocks, valleys, rivers, seas, cities, houses, gardens, forests, and so on." —Apoc.
Ex. 405.
Here again is a fact asserted as to the objects seen in the spiritual world. The
only rational mode of objecting to the principle affirmed is to deny the fact as
serted, and this brings us on to an entirely new ground in the conduct of the de
bate, to which it is not expedient now to pass. If you are still at a loss to per

58 REPLY TO DR. WOODS.
other life to the verbal frame- work of the Word, let me here remark that, in the
profound philosophy of Swedenborg, the actual creation of these objects in
the material world proceeds from the fixing or ultimating these very represent
ative essences —for they are essential or substantial —in material forms, so that
under God, the first great cause, the one becomes the proximate cause of the
other, and thus the correspondence between them develops itself. The philosophy
of all this is very clearly unfolded in the ensuing paragraph.
" That nothing exists in nature but from a spiritual principle is, because there
cannot anything be given, unless it has a soul ; all that is called soul which is es
sence, for what has not in itself an essence, this does not exist, for it is a nonen
tity, because there is no esse from which it is ; thus it is with nature ; its essence
from which it exists is the spiritual principle, because this has in itself the
divine esse, and also the divine power of acting, creating, and forming, as will be
seen from whaUfollows : this essence may also be called soul : because all that
is spiritual lives, and what is alive, when it acts into what is not alive, as into
what is natural, causes it either to have as it were life, or to derive somewhat
of the appearance thereof from the living principle : the latter [is the case] in
vegetables, the former in animals. That nothing in nature exists but from what
is spiritual, is because no effect is given without a cause, whatever exists in ef
fect is from a cause ; what is not from a cause, is separated ; thus it is with na
ture ; the singular and most singular things thereof are an effect from a cause
which is prior to it, and which is interior to
it,
and which
is
superior to
it,
and
also
is
immediately from God
;
for a spiritual world
is
given, that world
is
prior,
interior, and superior to the natural world, wherefore everything of the spiritual
world
is
a cause and everything of the natural world
is
an effect. Indeed one
thing exists from another progressively even in the natural world, but this by
causes from the spiritual world, for where the cause of the effect is, there also
is
the cause of the effect efficient
;
for every effect becomes an efficient cause in
order even to the ultimate, where the effective power subsists
;
but this
is
effect
ed continually from
a
spiritual principle, in which alone that force
is
;
and so
it
is,' that nothing in nature exists except from something spiritual and
by
it."—Ath.
Creed. 94.
If
this
is
well founded we can no longer recognize creation as the immediate
product of the divine fiat, but as always proceeding through the spiritual world,
which itself proceeds by emanation from the Lord himself. All living organisms,
whether animal or vegetable, are the elaborations of spiritual essences which be
come fixed and sensibly mirrored in material embodiments, and this fact dis
closes the true ground of correspondences. The idea
is
strikingly exhibited in an
incident mentioned as
a
part of Swedenborg's experience in the world of spirits.
"
I
heard two presidents of the English Royal Society, Sir Hans Sloane and
Martin Folkes, conversing together in the spiritual world concerning the exist
ence of seeds and eggs, and concerning productions from them on earth
:
the
former ascribed them to nature, insisting that nature was, from creation, endued
with powers of producing such things by means of the sun's heat
;
the other said
that that power
is
continually from God the Creator in nature. In order to de
termine the dispute,
a
beautiful bird was exhibited to Sir Hans Sloane, and he
was told to examine whether in any the least thing
it
differed from a similar
bird on earth
:
he held
it
in his hand, examined
it,
and said that there was no
difference
;
he knew that
it
was no other than an affection of a certain angel re
presented without him as
a
bird, and that
it
would vanish or cease with its af
fection
;
which also came to pass. Sir Hans Sloane was convinced by this ex
periment, that nature does not contribute at all to the production of vegetables

and animals, but only that which flows from the spiritual world into the natural ;
he also said, that if that bird were to be filled in its least parts with correspond
ing matter from the earth, and so fixed, it would be a durable bird, as birds are
on earth ; and that it is the same with things that are from hell. He added fur
ther, that if he had known what he now knew of the spiritual world, he would
not have ascribed any more to nature, than that it served the spiritual principle
which is from God, in fixing the things that continually How into nature."—(D.
L. ty W. 344.)
The essence of the bird therefore is a spiritual entity which becomes a living
bird by being fixed in, or clothed with, a material body, and this entity is from
the infinitude of the divine affections and thoughts. In the first bird created
there is primarily existent a psychical form, or spiritual body, which by the in
flowing of the divine Life and by the law which connects matter with spirit,
works out a material body corresponding with what we may term the psychical
or soui-body and adapted to its uses and ends in the natural world. But with
all subsequent birds the case is different ; here the creation is by procreation, in
which the parent transmits the psychical principle, the interior form, and this is
endowed with the power of gathering around it the earthly elements necessary
to the construction of the body of the bird, the all pervading life of the divine
love meantime flowing in and animating
it,
and endowing
it
with the intelligence
or instinct appropriate to the peculiar character of its reigning affection. This
psychical principle, however, in birds and beasts, unlike that in man,
is
not im
mortal, but
is
dissipated at death. The creatures of this kind which are seen in
the spiritual world are not the disembodied souls of birds or beasts, but mere
transient representative appearances created by and flowing proximately from the
internal states, as to affection and thought, of angels and spirits. Yet when
I
term
them appearances
I
do not mean that they are not really substantial. The spiritual
world
is
far more a world of substance —of that which stands under —than the ma
terial world. These visual appearances then, though intrinsically substantial,
are what
is
prim, not what
is
posterior, to the earthly formations.
I
am well aware that this may properly be termed wading in deep waters, but
it
is,
I
conceive, merely carrying out or illustrating the scope of what Swedenborg
says, in the extract quoted above, respecting the rationale of creation, and my
object in thus expanding the idea
is
to exhibit somewhat clearly the principle
of correspondence which underlies the whole doctrine of the spiritual sense. A
lamb, for instance, corresponds to innocence, " since innocence
is
primary in
the Lord's kingdom, and
is
the celestial itself there, and since sacrifices and burnt-
offerings represented the spiritual and celestial things of the Lord's kingdom,
therefore the very essential of his kingdom, which
is
innocence, was represented
by lambs.
»
„
,
The reason why a woman at her delivery, when the days of cleans -
ing were accomplished, was to offer
a
lamb for a burnt-offering, or a dove, or a
turtle, was that the effect of conjugial love might be signified (which
is
inno
cence), and because infants signify innocence." —(A. C. 3994.) Now
a
lamb
is
a living embodiment of the affection of innocence. That affection
is
the proxi
mate cause of its existence and its organic structure and configuration correspond
with its internal essence. Consequently the term lamb denotes, in its spiritual
sense, that affection wherever
it
occurs in the Word. This
is
intuitively perceiv
ed by the angels, inasmuch as whenever a lamb appears in the spiritual world

80 REPLY TO DR. WOODS.
—as is usually the case when they are discoursing of innocence —they are led
at once to recognize the relation between the symbol and the affection. It
is fundamentally the relation of cause and effect, and this is the true nature of cor
respondence. How remote the principle is, then, from the fanciful and the arbi
trary, one may perceive at a glance.
I now propose to exhibit some other phases of this doctrine of the esoteric
sense of the Scriptures. Upon no point is Swedenborg more explicit than in
reference to the ulterior import of the Word as having respect to the Lord him
self and the spiritual and celestial things of his kingdom. It is in this import,
in fact, that its true and essential divinity consists. He thus speaks on this
head.
" That the Word of the Old Testament contains the arcana of heaven, and
that all and everything therein regards the Lord, his heaven, the church, faith,
and the things which are of faith, no mortal derives from the letter ; for from the
letter or literal sense, no one sees anything else than that they regard in general
the externals of the Jewish Church ; when yet there are internal things through
out, which are no where manifest in the externals, except a very few which the
Lord revealed and explained to the apostles ; as that sacrifices signify the Lord ;
that the land of Canaan and Jerusalem signify heaven ; whence it is called the
heavenly Canaan and Jerusalem ; in like manner Paradise.
" But that things all and each, yea the most particular, even to the smallest jot,
signify and involve spiritual and celestial things, the Christian world is hitherto
profoundly ignorant ; wherefore also it little regards the Old Testament. This
truth, however, might appear plain from this single circumstance, that the Word,
being of the Lord and from the Lord, could not possibly have any existence, un
less interiorly it contained such things as are of heaven, of the church, and of
faith ; otherwise it could not be called the Word of the Lord, nor be said to have
any life in it ; for whence is the life, but from those things which are of life ? that
is, except from hence, that all and singular things have relation to the Lord, who
is most real and essential life ? Wherefore whatsoever does not interiorly regard
the Lord, does not live ; yea, whatsoever expression in the Word does not in
volve Him. or in its measure relate to Him, is not divine.
" Without such a life, the Word, as to the letter, is dead ; for it is with the Word
as with man, who, as is known in the Christian world, is external and internal;
the external man separated from the internal is the body, and thus dead ; but
the internal is that which lives, and gives to the external to live ; the internal
man is the soul : thus the Word, as to the letter alone, is like a body without a
soul.
" It is impossible to see from the sense of the letter only, when the mind abides
therein, that it contains such things ; as in these first chapters of Genesis, from
the sense of the letter nothing else is known than that it is treated of the crea
tion of the world, and of the garden of Eden, which is called Paradise, and also
of Adam as the first created man. Who supposes anything else ? But that they
contain arcana, which were never heretofore revealed, will sufficiently appear
from the following pages, and indeed that the first chapter of Genesis, in its inter
nal sense, treats of the New Creation of man, or of his Regeneration, in general,
and of the Most Ancient Church in particular ; and this in such a manner, that
there is not a single syllable which does not represent, signify, and involve
it.
" But that such
is
the case,
it
is
impossible for any mortal to know, except from
the Lord
:
wherefore
it
is
expedient here to premise, that of the Lord's Divine Mercy
it
has been granted me now for several years to be constantly and uninterruptedly
in the fellowship of spirits and angels, to hear them speak, and in turn to speak
with them
;
hence
it
has been granted me to hear and see astonishing things
which are in another life, which have never come to the knowledge of any man,
nor into his idea.

have there been instructed concerning different kinds of spir
its
;
concerning the state of souls after death
;
concerning hell, or the lamentable
state of the unfaithful
;
concerning heaven, or the most happy state of the faith

ful ; especially concerning the doctrine of faith which is acknowledged in the
universal heaven; on which subjects, by the divine mercy of the Lord, more
will b» said in the following pages."—A. C. 1-5.
" The historicals are what represent the Lord ; the words themselves are sig
nificative of the things which are represented. But being historical, the mind of
the reader cannot but be detained in the facts related, particularly at this day,
when most persons, and nearly all, do not believe that there exists an internal
sense, still less in each single word ; nor, possibly, will they yet acknowledge it,
notwithstanding it has been thus far so manifestly shown ; and this also by rea
son that the internal sense appears so to recede from the literal, as to be scarce
discernible. But they may know it from this consideration alone, that the his
toricals can by no means be the Word, because in them, separate from the inter
nal sense, there is no more of divinity than in any other history ; but the inter
nal sense makes it to be divine. That the internal sense is the Word itself, ap
pears from many things which are revealed ; as, ' Out of Egypt have I called my
Son,' Matt. ii. 15 : besides many other passages. The Lord himself, also, after
his resurrection, taught his disciples what was written concerning him in Moses
and the prophets, Luke xxiv. 27; thus that there is nothing written in the Word
but what has respect to him, his kingdom, and the church. These are the spir
itual and celestial contents of the Word ; whereas those contained in the literal
sense are for the most part worldly, corporeal, and earthly, such as can by no
means constitute the Word of the Lord. Men at this day are of such a character,
that they perceive only such matters as these, and scarcely know what spiritual
and celestial things are. It was otherwise with the men of the Most Ancient and
Ancient Churches, who, should they live at this day, and read the Word, would
not at all attend to the literal sense, which they would regard as none, but to the
internal sense ; they are exceedingly surprised that the Word is not thus perceived
by all ; wherefore, also, all the books of the ancients were so written, as to mean
in their interior sense otherwise than in the literal sense."—A. C. 1540.
Now we have only to recur to the declaration of Christ himself in Luke xxiv.
25, 27, 44, to be convinced that he recognizes the truth of the principle here as
serted, " 0 fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken !
and beginning at Moses, and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the
scriptures the things concerning himself. And he said unto them, These are the
words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be
fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the
Psalms concerning me." So also, Rev. xix. 10,
" The testimony of Jesus is the spirit
of prophecy." From this it is obvious that the central theme of the Word is
Jesus himself; but Jesus is Jehovah, and Jehovah is the Lord. Swedenborg"s
doctrine on this head receives therefore direct confirmation from the highest
source. " The Lord's frequent declarations, that in Him are to be consummated
and are consummated all things contained in the Scripture, involve those things
which are in the internal sense of the Word, for it is there treated solely concern
ing the Lord's kingdom, and in the supreme sense concerning the Lord Himself.
In that sense all and single things, even to every iota, or to every least
point, treat of the Lord." —(A. C. 7933.) Again, " The Lord appears manifestly
in the spiritual sense of the Word. From that sense it is discovered not only that
He is the Word, that is, divine truth itself, and further that He is the inmost of the
Word, and thence the all thereof, but also that He is the one God, in whom there
is a trinity, consequently the only God of heaven and earth." —(A. E. 1232.)
What disparagement do we read in all this to the superlative dignity and sanc
tity of the Holy Volume '

the distinction between apparent and real truth to be recognized in reading the
Word. This will be seen to be a subject of vastly more interest than would be
imagined from its bare announcement. The following paragraphs will disclose
its bearing. The text is Gen. xi. 7, " Let us go down," &c.
" Hence it may appear what is the nature of the sense of the letter, for Jeho
vah does not go down, inasmuch as going down cannot be predicated of the
Lord, because he is always in the supremes ; nor does Jehovah see whether a
thing be so or not, for neither can such seeing be predicated of the Lord, inas
much as he knows all and everything from eternity : but still it is so expressed,
because with man it appears as if it was so ; for man is in inferiors, and when
anything there exists, he does not consider, nor even know, how the case is
with superiors, so neither how they flow in ; for his thought reaches no further
than to those things which are nearest to him, and hence he cannot perceive
otherwise, than that going down and seeing signify something similar to what
is implied in the expressions ; and so much the more when he imagines that no
one is acquainted with what he thinks ; besides that he has no other idea than
that it is (to descend) from what is high, and when from God, that it is from the
highest, when yet it is not from the highest, but from the inmost. Hence it may
appear what is the nature of the sense of the letter, viz. that it is according to
appearances, and that if it were not according to appearance, no one would un
derstand and acknowledge the Word, consequently no one would receive it: but
the angels are not thus in appearances as man is, wherefore the Word, whilst
as to the letter it is for man, as to the internal sense is for the angels, and also
for those men, to whom, by the Divine Mercy of the Lord, it is given to be as
angels during their life in the world." —A. C. 2242.
" It is frequently said in the Word, that Jehovah destroys, but in an internal
sense is understood, that man destroys himself, for Jehovah or the Lord destroys
no one; but whether it appears as if it was from Jehovah or the Lord, because
He sees all and everything, and rules all and everything, it is thus expressed in
the Word throughout, to the intent that men may be thereby kept in this most
general idea, that all things are under the eyes of the Lord, and all things under
his influence and government, in which idea when they are once established,
they may afterwards easily be instructed ; for explications of the Word, as to the
internal sense, are nothing else but the particulars which elucidate a general idea.
A further purpose herein is, that they who are not in love, may be kept in fear,
and may thus be impressed with awe towards the Lord, and flee to Him for de
liverance : hence it is evident, that there is no harm in believing the sense of the
letter, although the internal sense teaches otherwise, provided it be done in sim
plicity of heart. The angels, who are in the internal sense of the Word, are so
far from thinking that Jehovah or the Lord destroys any one, that they cannot
even bear the idea of such a thing, and therefore when this and similar passages
in the Word are read by man, the sense of the letter is cast as it were behind
them, till at length it comes to this, that evil itself is what destroys man, and
that the Lord destroys no one."— A. C. 2395.
" What appearances are may appear manifestly from those passages in the
Word, where it is spoken according to appearances ; there are however degrees
of the appearances of truth ; natural appearances of truth are mostly fallacies,
but when they have place with those who are in good, they are then not to be
called fallacies, but appearances, and even truths in some respect, for the good
which is in them, and in which is the divine, causes their essence to be different;
but rational appearances of truth are more and more interior ; in them are the
heavens, that is, the angels who are in the heavens ; that some idea may be had
what the appearances of truth are, let the following cases serve for illustration.
I. Man believes that he is reformed and regenerated by the truth of faith, but
this is an appearance, he is reformed and regenerated by the good of faith, that
is, by charity towards the neighbor, and love to the Lord. II. Man believes that
truth gives to perceive what is good, because it teaches, but this is an appear
ance, it is good which gives to truth to perceive, for good is the soul, or hie of

perfects truth. V. Goods of life appear to man as the fruits of faith, but they
are the fruits of charity : from these few cases it may in some measure be known
what the appearances of truth are ; such appearances are innumerable. —A. C.

than any one could believe, are spoken according to appearances, and accord
ing to the fallacies of the senses ; as that Jehovah is in wrath, anger, and fury,
against the wicked, that he rejoices to destroy them and blot them out, yea, that
he slays them. But these modes of speaking were used, that persuasions and
lusts might not be broken, but might be bent: for to speak otherwise than man
conceives, which is from' appearances, fallacies, and persuasions, would have
been to sow seed in the water, and to speak what would instantly be rejected.
Nevertheless, those things may serve as common vessels for the containing of
things spiritual and celestial, since it may be insinuated into them, that all things
art from the Lord; afterwards, that the Lord permits, but that all evil is from
diabolical spirits ; next, that the Lord provides and disposes, that evils may be
turned into goods; lastly, that nothing but good is from the Lord. Thus the
sense of the letter perishes as it ascends, and becomes spiritual, afterwards ce
lestial, and lastly divine." —A. C. 1874.
" The devastation of the church is here attributed to the angel, in the same sense
in which it is elsewhere in the Word attributed to the Lord ; but this is only said
of him in the sense of the letter, but it is not so understood in the spiritual sense,
for truth in the sense of the letter, is as a face transparent through a veil, but
truth in the spiritual sense is as the face uncovered ; or truth in the literal sense
is as a cloud, but truth in the spiritual sense is as light and the splendor thereof;
or truth in the literal sense is what appears as truth before the sensual man, but
truth in the spiritual sense is what appears before the spiritual rational man; as,
for example, in the Word it is said of the sun, that it rises, makes progress, sets,
and makes days and years, thus altogether according to appearance before the
sensual man ; but still the rational man thinks of the sun as immoveable, and of
the earth as making progress ; hence it is evident that the understanding thinks
inversely of those things which appear before the senses, in order that they may
be presented before us in the light of truth. The case is the same with the things
which are here said in the Apocalypse concerning Him who sat upon the white
cloud, and concerning the angels, viz., that they thrust in the sickle into the har
vest, and reap it^and that they gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, and
cast them into the wine-press of the anger of God ; which things are said in like
manner according to appearances before the sensual man, but are to be inverted
and understood according to their spiritual sense. From these considerations it
may also appear, that the sensual man, such as man is in the ages of infancy and
childhood, as likewise the simple-minded, may think of and believe these and
similar other things according to the sense of the letter, as that God takes away
good and truth from men on account of their wickedness, but an adult man who
desires to be wise, will not explain such things so as to make God do them, as
that he takes away from man all good and truth, and infuses in the place thereof
what is evil and false, or that He devastates the church, and that he is angry and
full of wrath, for if a wise adult should explain such things according to the
sense of the letter, and confirm the same by reasonings, he would thereby de
stroy genuine truth itself, such as it is in heaven, and consequently shut heaven
against himself; for how is it possible for any one to enter heaven with the faith
that God is angry, revengeful, that he punishes, and the like, when the angels of
heaven are in the perception that God is never angry, never revenges, nor pun
ishes any one ; would they not avert themselves from him, and bid him to
depart, and immediately shut the door after him ? thus also it is that heaven be
comes shut to those who, during their abode in the world, explain the literal
sense of the Word so as to destroy the divine truth in the heavens, which truth
is also the same with that of the spiritual sense of the Word, which is contained

in singular the truths of the natural sense which constitute the sense of the letter
of the Word."— A. E. 916.
He is also elsewhere very express as to the conditions under which such
appearances do not exert a hurtful influence upon those who are governed by them,
as iq the following passage.
" From these and very many other passages of the Word it may be manifest,
that it is spoken according to appearances with man, wherefore whoever is dis
posed to confirm false principles by the appearances according to which the
Word is written, may do so from things innumerable ; but there is a difference
between confirming false principles by passages from the Word, and believing
in simplicity what is spoken in the Word. He who confirms false principles,
first assumes some principle of his own, from which he will not depart, nor in
the least remit, but collects and accumulates corroborating proofs from every
quarter, thus also from the Word, till he is so thoroughly self-persuaded that he
can no longer see the truth. But whosoever in simplicity, or out of a simple
heart, believes, does not first assume principles, but thinks what is spoken to be
true, because the Lord spake it ; and if he is instructed in the right understand
ing thereof, by other sayings of the Word, he then acquiesces, and in his heart
rejoices. Even he who through simplicity believes that the Lord is wrathful,
that he punishes, repents, and grieves, whereby he is restrained from evil, and
led to do good, is not at all hurt thereby, for he thus believes also that the Lord
sees all and everything, and when he is in such faith, he is afterwards enlight
ened in other things, in another life, if not before : it is different with those who
are self-persuaded in consequence of principles assumed, the foul love of self
and of the world conspiring." —A, C. 589.
Closely connected with this is the doctrine of fallacies appertaining to the sen
sual or natural man, and with which real truth comes into conflict in the mind
and often can expel only after a long struggle.
" Inasmuch as few know what the fallacies of the senses are, and few believe
that they induce so great shade upon things rational, and most especially upon
the spiritual things of faith, even so as to extinguish them, principally when
man at the same time is in the delight of the lusts of self-love and the love of the
world, it is permitted to illustrate the subjects by examples, first what the falla
cies of the senses are which are merely natural, or in those things which are in
nature, and next concerning the fallacies of the senses in spiritual things. I. It
is a fallacy of sense merely natural, or which is in nature, that it is believed that
the sun revolves once every day round about this earth, and at the same time
also the heaven with all the stars : and although it be said, that it is incredible
because impossible, that so great an ocean of fire as the sun is, and not only the sun
but also innumerable stars, without any change of place from each other, should
every day perform one such revolution, and although it be added, that it may be
seen from the planets, that the earth performs a diurnal and annual motion by
circumrotations and circumgyrations, inasmuch as the planets also are earths,
and some of them likewise have moons around them, and that it has been ob
served that they, in like manner as our earth, perform such motions, namely,
diurnal and annual, still with the generality the fallacy of sense prevails, that it
is so as the eye sees. II. It is a fallacy of sense merely natural, or in nature, that
there is only one single atmosphere, and merely this purer successively in differ
ent parts, and that where it ceases there is a vacuum ; the external sensual of
man, when it alone is consulted, does not apprehend otherwise. III. It is a fal
lacy of sense merely natural, that from first creation there has been impressed on
seeds a quality of growing up into trees and flowers, and of rendering them
selves prolific, and that thence is the existence and subsistence of all things ; and
if it be urged, that it is not possible for anything to subsist unless it perpetually
exists, according to the established maxim that subsistence is perpetual exist
ence, also that everything which is not connected with something prior to itself
tills into nothing, still the sensual of the body, and the thought from that sen

sual, does not apprehend it, nor that all and single things subsist as they existed,
by influx from the spiritual world, that is, through the spiritual world from the
Divine. IV. Hence it is a fallacy of sense merely natural, that there are simple
substances, which are monads and atoms, for whatever is within the external
sensual, this the natural man believes, that it is such a thing or nothing. V. It
is a fallacy of sense merely natural, that all things are of nature and from nature,
and that indeed in purer or interior nature there is something which is not appre
hended ; but if it be said, that within or above nature there is the spiritual and
celestial, this is rejected, and it is believed that unless it be natural, it is nothing.
VI. it is a fallacy of sense, that the body alone lives, and that its life perishes
when it dies ; the sensual does not at all apprehend, that the internal man is in
single things of the external, and that the internal man is within nature in the
spiritual world : hence neither does he believe, because he does not apprehend,
that he shall live after death, unless he be again clothed with a body. VII.
Hence there is a fallacy of sense, that man can no more live after death than the
beasts, by reason that these also have a life in many respects similar to the life
of man, only that man is a more perfect animal. The sensual does not appre
hend, that is, the man who thinks and concludes from the sensual, that man is
above the beasts and has a superior life in this, because he can think, not only
concerning the causes of things, but also concerning the Divine and by faith and
love be conjoined with the Divine, and also receive influx thence, and appro
priate it to himself, so that in man, because there is given a reciprocal, there is
given reception, which is in no wise the case with the beasts. VIII. It is a fal
lacy thence, that the living principle itself with man, which is called the soul, is
only something ethereal, or flamy, which is dissipated when man dies ; aud that
it resides either in the heart, or in the brain, or in some part thereof, and that
hence it rules the body as a machine; that the internal man is in single things of
the external, that the eye does not see from itself but from that internal man, nor
the ear hear from itself but from that, the sensual man does not apprehend. IX.
It is a fallacy of sense, that light cannot be given from any other source than
from the sun or elementary fire, nor heat from any other source than from the
same ; that there is light in which is intelligence, and heat in which is celestial
love, and that all the angels are in that light and in that heat, the sensual does
not apprehend. X. It is a fallacy of sense, that man believes that he lives of
himself, or that he has in-given life, for to the sensual it does not appear other
wise ; that it is the Divine alone which has life of itself, and thus that there is
only one life, and that the lives in the world are only recipient forms, the sensual
does not at all comprehend. XI. The sensual man from fallacy believes that
adulteries are allowed, for from the sensual he concludes, that marriages are only
with a view to order for the sake of the education of the offspring, and if that
order is not destroyed, that it is a matter of indifference from what [father] the
offspring comes; also that the conjugial is like other lasciviousness except as
being allowed ; thus also, that it would not be contrary to order to marry more
wives than one, if the christian world did not from the sacred scripture prohibit
it; if it be told them, that there is a correspondence between the heavenly mar
riage and marriages in the earths, and that no one can have in himself the conju
gial, unless he be in spiritual truth and good, also that the genuine conjugial can
not be given between a husband aud several wives, and hence that marriages
are in themselves holy, these things the sensual man rejects as nothing. XII. It
is a fallacy of sense, that the Lord's kingdom, or heaven, is of a quality resem
bling an earthly kingdom in this, that there it is joy and happiness for one to be
greater than another, and thence in glory above another; for the sensual does not
at all comprehend what is meant by the least being greatest, or the last first; if
it be told them, that joy in heaven or to the angels is to serv^ others by doing
them good, without any reflection of merit and retribution, this comes as some
thing sad. XIII. It is a fallacy of sense, that good works are meritorious ; and
that to do well to any one for the sake of self is a good work. XIV. It is also a
fallacy of sense, that man is saved by faith alone ; and that faith can be given
where there is not charity ; also that the faith, not the life, remains after death.
The case is similar in very many other instances; wherefore when the sensual
bears rule in man, then the rational illustrated from the Divine sees nothing and

is in thick darkness, and then it is believed, that all that is rational, which U
concluded from the sensual." —A. C. 5084.
I have been perhaps unduly full in these citations, but it has arisen from an
extreme anxiety to present a great subject in its true light. It is so common to
represent Swedenborg's doctrine of the spiritual sense as the ne plus ultra of ex
travagance and absurdity, that the utmost solicitude is warranted as to the full
and fair exhibition of the theory in reference to the fundamental principles on
which it rests. Its opponents seem, for the most part, to have no conception of
anything like a psychological basis for what strikes them as the most outre, gro
tesque, and fantastic of all things, in Swedenborg's interpretations. Yet we here
see the whole matter resolving itself into a law as fixed and invariable as the law
of creation itself, with which, in fact, it becomes almost identical. The Bible
rises under the process into a new revelation, clothed with a sublimity, sanctity,
and divinity of which we had not previously the remotest conception. It stands
before us the living Oracle of Truth, which we no longer separate from the very
being of its Author. He is Himself in his own truth. New treasures of wisdom
gleam forth from its pages, and the most barren details of history, the recorded
rounds of obsolete rituals, the dryest catalogues of names, the most trivial
specifications of dates, places, and enactments, once touched with the mystic
wand of the spiritual sense teem with the riches of angelic conceptions. The
cosmogony of Genesis becomes the birth register of the new-born soul. The
garden of Eden smiles in every renovated mind in the intelligence and affection
emblemed in its trees, and fruits, and flowers. The watering streams are the
fructifying knowledges and truths of wisdom, which make increase of the
spiritual man. The Tree of Knowledge —the Tree of Life —the wily serpent—
are all within us and within us all. The scenes transacted in the Paradisaic pur
lieus are more or less the scenes of our own individual experience, and the nar
rative ceases to be looked upon merely as the chronicle of events that transpired
thousands of years before we were born.
But I easily foresee the grand objection. The spiritual sense destroys the lite
ral sense. It turns the history of creation into an allegory, and leaves us with
out a document as to the origin of things. And suppose this be so, still is it not
possible to array an amount of evidence in favor of the position, that shall coun
tervail the force of every objection ? This is worth inquiry.
Nothing, I venture to say, is more really beyond debate, than that the exposi
tions hitherto given of the inspired cosmogony of Moses have failed clearly to
establish its consistency with the results of geological science. I am well aware
that the assertion is reiterated from a thousand tongues, that there is no real dis
crepancy in the case— that even granting Geology all that it demands on the score
of time, yet still the sacred text is so framed as to create no conflict between the
written and the unwritten record. But I yet hesitate not to say, that no inter
pretation hitherto proposed by those who understand the Mosaic narrative as a
veritable historic document, is in all points consistent with the inductive results
of modern Geology, and of this science it is affirmed that although " it is but
of very modern origin, and its researches have as yet been carried but little way,
compared with what we must reasonably expect they will be; yet to that small
extent its foundations have been laid in absolutely determined facts, and general

results, which are real, settled, and inductive truths, which no subsequent inves
tigations can overthrow; which, in fact, can only be called in question on
grounds which, if true, must overthrow, not only Geology, but all inductive
science whatever, that is, the whole extent of human knowledge, and render our
reasoning faculties useless, and all philosophy a mere illusion." —Kitto's Bibl.
Cyclop. (Art. Creation.)
Among the theories of solution advanced, one proposes to consider the first
verse of Genesis as announcing, in a general way, the original creation of the
primordial matter or substance, out of which the heavens and the earth were sub
sequently fashioned and arranged, through the period of the sixdays, into their
present form and order. On this interpretation, the first verse is held to stand
separate and independent of what follows, the break between them allowing all
the time that Geology may require to work its stupendous changes. But to this
it is objected, (1.) That it does violence to the general impression which would
naturally be conveyed by the language. (2.) That the " heavens" and the " earth"
said to be created in the first verse do not easily yield such an abstract and met
aphysical idea as that of elementary matter, and that they are obviously to be un
derstood as identical with the " heavens" and the " earth" which the writer im
mediately goes on to describe, v. 6-9. This makes the first verse a compend of
the subsequent amplified account of the creation. (3.) That the actual discoveries
of Geology make it clear that various races of animals lived and died during the
very interval assigned between the original creation and the six days' work, and
yet the text brings the creation of animals into the fifth and sixth days.
Another hypothesis is that of the lengthened days, and which supposes that the
succession of geological beds exhibits a correspondence with the recorded order
of formations in Genesis. But to this theory it is again objected, (1.) That the
most accurate investigations do not establish the fact of such a correspondence.
(2.) That such a figurative use of the term " day," however it might suit with a
poetical or oratorical style of diction, were scarcely to be expected in a plain his
torical narrative. (3.) That if this prolonged duration be ascribed to each of the
six days of the creation, it ought in fairness to hold good also of the seventh ; but
here the theorists go back to the ordinary sense of a natural day.
Other attempted modes of conciliation may be pointed out, but, like the preced
ing, they still labor under some insuperable difficulty of being brought into har
mony with the demonstrated facts and inevitable inferences of Geology. I do
not scruple, therefore, to affirm that all such attempts have, without exception,
failed, and this has been freely admitted even by learned divines, whose reve
rence for the Scriptures has not at the same time prevented their recognizing the
force of the geological argument. Thus the Rev. Badin Powell, Professor of
Geometry in the University of Oxford, one of the profoundest writers of the present
day, says upon this subject :
" With regard to the nature and extent of the dis
crepancy thus disclosed, we shall observe, that it is not a case merely involving
the question of the literal acceptation of a word or phrase. It is the contradic
tion of existing monuments of past events with the obvious sense of what is re
corded as a part of Divine revelation, in the form of a circumstantial narrative of
the same events. And the discrepancy is not one with any theory, or partial
discovery of science, which is not thoroughly made out, and which future inves
tigations may modify or set aside; but with broad primary facts which involve

nothing hypothetical, and which are in reality identified with the first principles
of all inductive truth."—Kitto's Bibl. Cyclop. (Art. Creation.)
What then, in this exigency, is Swedenborg's construction of the Mosaic re
cord, which construction, be it observed, was given to the world before Geology
was born, and therefore could not have been proposed with a view to meet any
difficulties urged on this score. He takes it at once out of all relation to verita
ble literal history, and instead of reading in it the account of a physical creation
of the universe, interprets it of the moral re-creation or regeneration of man.*
* " They who do not think beyond the sense of the letter, cannot believe otherwise than
that the creation, which is described in the first and second chapters of Genesis, denotes
the creation of the universe, and that there were six days, within which were created the
heaven and the earth, the sea, and all things which are in them, and at length man to
the likeness of God ; but who cannot see, if he ponders deeply on the subject, that the
creation of the universe is not there meant ; for such things are there described as may
be known from common sense not to have been so ; as that there were days before the
sun and the moon, and that there was light and darkness, and that the herbs arid trees
budded forth ; and yet that light was given by those luminaries, and a distinction was
made into light and darkness, and thus days were made. In what follows in the history
there are also similar things, which are scarce acknowledged by any one who thinks in
teriorly, to be possible, as that the woman was built from the rib of the man ; also that
two trees were set in paradise, the fruit of one of which it was forbidden to eat ; and
that a serpent from one discoursed with the wife of the man, who was the wisest of
mortals, and by his discourse, which was from the mouth of the serpent, deceived them
both ; and that the universal human race, even to somanythousands of thousands, was on
that account damned to hell; these and similar things in that history must needs ap
pear at first thought paradoxes to those, who entertain any doubt concerning the sancti
ty ol the Word, and must needs afterwards induce them to deny the Divine [being or
principle] therein : nevertheless it is to be noted, that all and singular things in that his
tory, even to the smallest iota, are Divine, and contain in them arcana, which before
the angels in the heavens are evident as in clear day ; the reason of this is, because the
angels do not see the sense of the Word according to the letter, but according to those
things which are therein, which are spiritual and celestial things, and in them Divine
things ; they, when the first chapter of Genesis is read, do not perceive any other crea
tion, than the new creation of man, which is called regeneration; this [regeneration]
is described in that history ; and by paradise the wisdom of the man created anew;
by the two trees in the midst thereof the two faculties of that man, viz. the will of good
by the tree of life, and the understanding of truth by the tree of science ; and the rea
son why it was forbidden to eat of this latter tree was, because the regenerate man, or
he that is created anew, ought no longer to be led by the understanding of truth, but by
the will of good, and if otherwise that the new principle of his life perishes ; consequent
ly that by Adam, or man, and by Eve his wife was there meant a new Church, and
by eating of the tree of science the fall of that Church from good to truth, consequently
from love to the Lord and towards the neighbor to faith without those loves, and this by
reasoning from the intellectual proprium, which reasoning is the serpent. From these
considerations it is evident, that the historicals concerning creation, and concerning the
first man, and concerning paradise, are historicals so framed, which contain in them
celestial and Divine things, and this according to the manner [of writing] received in
the ancient Churches; which manner [of writing] also was thence derived to several
who were out of the Church, who in like manner devised historicals, and involved ar
cana in them ; as is evident from the writers of the ancient times ; for in the ancient
Churches it was known, what such things as are in the world signified in heaven ; nor
were the things transacted of so much consequence to them to describe, as the things which
were of heaven ; these latter things occupied their minds, by reason that they thought
more interiorly than men at this day, and thereby communicated with angels, on which
account it was delightful to them to connect such things ; but to those things which
were to be accounted holy in the Churches, they were led by the Lord ; hence such
things neatly contrived as fully corresponded. From these considerations it may be
manifest, what is meant by heaven and earth in the first verse of the first chapter of
Genesis, viz. the Church internal and external ; that those things are signified by hea
ven and earth, is manifest also from passages in the prophets, where mention is made
of a new heaven and a new earth, by which a new church is meant ; hence then it is
evident that by in six days Jehovah made the heaven and the earth and the sea, is sig
nified the regeneration and vivification of those things which are in the internal and
in the external man." —A. C. 8891.

REPLY TO DR. WOODS. 69
This he affirms is the sense which the angels take from this portion of the Word,
and the only sense.
" They know nothing at all which is of the letter, not even
one word, what itproximately signifies, still less the names of countries, rivers,
and persons, which occur so frequently in the historical and prophetical parts.
They have only an idea of the things signified by names ; as by Adam in Para
dise they have a perception of the Most Ancient Church," &c.
Adam, therefore, on this interpretation, is not the name of an individual, but
a generic name of the race existing as a church, and the peculiar use of the He
brew article certainly favors the supposition, for it is an undeniable fact that the
word, with four or five exceptions, invariably occurs in the original in a form
equivalent to—" the Adam," i. e. the collective Adam or Mankind. Thus Gen.
vi. 1,
" And it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth,"
Heb. " when the Adam" began to multiply. " The reason," says Swedenborg,
" why he is called Adam is, because the Hebrew word Adam signifies Man ; but
that he is never by name properly called Adam, but Man, is very evident from its
being predicated of both the man and the woman, both together being called
man. That it is predicated of both, every one may see from the words, for it is
said, ' He called their name Adam (or man) in the day that they were created.'
In like manner it is said in the first chapter, ' Let us make mar. (Heb. the Adam)
in our own image, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,' &c. Hence
it may appear that the subject treated of is not the creation of some one man who
was the first of mankind, but concerning the Most Ancient Church." —(A. C. 478.)
Now whatever may be the interpretation, here stands the undeniable fact, that
the name Adam in the original is a collective and not an individual appellation ;
and this fact taken in connection with the geological difficulty affords no small
evidence that some other than the strictly literal construction is the true one.
Let us weigh then a little more attentively the interpretation of Swedenborg.
Building itself upon the legitimate plural import of the term Adam, it makes the
history in the first few chapters the history, not of an individual, but of the race
in some indefinitely distant period of the past, and composing what he denomi
nates the Most Ancient Church. According to him the Scriptures do not contain
any intimation of the time or manner of the first creation of man. It leaves the
mind free to throwback his origin into the most remote period of antiquity, and
make him, if you please, coeval with some of the extinct races of huge Masto
dons and monsters whose embedded remains are continually at this day being
brought to light. It is indeed true that no relics of human skeletons have as yet
been discovered that can be referred to a period beyond what is called the histo
rical; but the progress of discovery has but just commenced, and we cannot ar
gue from what has been to what may be.* And when we take into view the fact
that the chronological archives of the Hindoos, the Chinese, and the Egyptians,
which have never yet been shown to be fabulous, and which are only disputed
because they are supposed to conflict with the biblical record, carry back the
origin of the human race to an immensely more remote period than the Mosaic
annals when literally understood, we shall have no occasion to be surprised, if
* The recent discovery, near Natches, of a part of a human skeleton embedded among
the remains of animals which must be referred to a period vastly beyond that usually
ascribed to the origin of the human race, seems to require a qualification of this lan
guage ; but it is one which I can well afford to make.

future geological discoveries should bring to light, from some of the earlier strata,
the fossil remains of men as well as of other animals.
From this view it follows, as you will at once perceive, that the fall of man
was gradual— that it was not the fall of a single individual, but the progressive
decline and deterioration of the race from a previous state of integrity to a state
of alienation, rebellion, corruption, and deep depravity. The race having existed
through a long tract of ages, began by degrees to abuse their free will, and though
the departure at first was very slight, yet each generation advancing a little far
ther in the downward career than the preceding, the collective humanity at length
lapsed into an accumulation of evils which became perpetuated by the very law
of their being, for it is a law that a man propagates his essential life. He repro
duces his inmost self in his children. And in this matter we cannot separate the
physical from the moral. A man's moral life affects his physical life. If his life
—his essence —is evil, that evil will reappear in his children ; and the evil of any
one generation is the accumulated result of the evils of preceding generations.
And as this evil was gradually acquired and accumulated, so it must be grad
ually laid off before he can ever return to his pristine condition. Man must im
prove through successive generations ere the moral image of God can be fully re-
instampedupon him, and everlasting thanks are due to His goodness that provis
ion is made for this restoration, and that He has purposed to effect it. Regener
ation is the appointed means ; and in regeneration there is a continued infusion
of the divine principles of Love and Wisdom which elaborate a new interior life,
and this by degrees works itself into the physical man, so that as far as he yields
himself to its influence there is a perpetual transforming and ameliorating process
going on that must inevitably show itself in his descendants from age to age.
For it operates by a fixed law of life, and ten thousand volumes of a contrary
theology can never countervail a settled law of the universe. As man has re
ceded from the immutable order established by the Deity, and as he has done
this in the exercise of his moral freedom, so he must retrace his steps in a like
voluntary return.
Now I would beg you to contrast this view of the fall and the rising again —
the ruin and the recovery of the human race—with that which is generally
inculcated in all Christian schools. Are we not conscious of something which
taxes our rational faculty in the idea, that the moral destinies of the race were
first, by a federal arrangement, embodied in a single individual —that he was
placed in a garden one day and sinned and fell the next —and that too by the
machinations of an evil spirit in the form of a serpent of whose existence he had
not been informed, and against whose arts he had not been warned ! , I speak
with entire confidence in expressing the conviction, that every man who reflects
calmly is conscious of a difficulty on this score—that there is something in the
promptings of every one's bosom that leads him to ask, whether there is not
some other than the literal solution of the problem of the origin of terrestrial evil ?
Was such a stupendous event as the fall of man—involving the eternal perdition
of so many millions of human beings—brought about so suddenly- and by the mor
al act of an individual in the very infancy of his existence —not a week old —
having no experience —and, as we should suppose, very little competent to weigh
the amazing issues that depended upon his conduct ? Who would not gladly find
some other mode of explanation for this mysterious transaction if it were intrin

sically possible '. That misgivings do arise on this head in thousands of minds, is
beyond all question. But they are not indulged —they are quickly suppressed by
the force of the lessons of the catechism and the authority of the dogma. Prejn- .
dice, the child of tradition, reigns every where so rampant that the man of the
church trembles at its frown and, under the constant teachings that Reason is for
ever to be held subject to Faith, he tries to throw his doubts to the winds,
though, like a projected handful of feathers, they are incessantly Mown back
upon him.
In this emergency Swedenborg's sublime developments come in and speak
peace and assurance to the laboring reason. Seizing hold of the deep inner in
tuitions of the soul, which lie embedded below the superincumbent strata of ed
ucational faith, they lift them up into the light of rational conviction and oracular
assertion. It is like boring an Artesian well of truth down to the nethermost
depths of the spirit, through which the confined and troubled waters gush up
to the surface, flowing forth in streams and expanding into lakes. Such a view
is indeed so entirely contrary to the apparant sense of the letter, and to the theo
logical systems built upon it, that it must necessarily encounter a deadly oppo
sition from the adherents of the common creeds. But Truth is armed with om
nipotence, and it will gradually work its way to universal admission. It will
then, I am persuaded, become as much a matter of wonder that these first chap
ters of Genesis were regarded as a veritable piece of history, as it now is that
the Ptolemaic system of Astronomy should ever have obtained currency as a
scientific scheme of the universe.
It would be easy to extend this view of Swedenborg's interpretations, and
show what innumerable difficulties are avoided by applying the principle of the
spiritual sense to settle the import of disputed texts. Especially would it be
gratifying to be able to spread before you his expositions of the 24th and 25th
chapters of Matthew and other prophecies relative to the end of the World, show
ing that nothing is farther from the scope of these predictions than to announce
a physical destruction of " the great globe which we inhabit," instead of which
we are merely to read in them the passing away of an old dispensation, and the
ushering in of a new one, and that no figment of fancy was ever more gross
than that the Saviour is to appear visibly in the clouds of heaven and to put an
end to the mundane system by a general conflagration.
May I, then, venture to consider myself as having developed, in some good
degree, the true genius of the spiritval sense of the Word ? If I have at all succeed
ed in this according to my hope, you will scarcely fail to have perceived, that
this feature of Swedenborg's system is well entitled to that pre-eminence which
is uniformly assigned to it by his adherents. It is in their estimate the crown
and climax of his revelations, and though it cannot be viewed apart from the
laws and phenomena of the other life, yet in a comparative view of the intrinsic
importance of the two classes of disclosures we do not hesitate to give the palm
to this. It invests the hallowed oracles with a glory like that which pervaded
the Holy of Holies when the curtain was lifted and the eye of the High Priest
gazed upon the sacred recess. The envelope of the natural sense falls off and
all becomes intellectual, spiritual, and celestial.

spiritual sense, and how it differs from the literal, lest we should " mistake the one
for the other, and think we had got the internal meaning, when we had obtained
nothing more than a refined natural sense, by an ingenious explanation of some
eastern allegory or metaphor" —goes on to observe ;—" The spiritual sense of the
Word of God does not in the least relate to any event or circumstance in this
natural world ; it has no relation whatever to the condition of man as a natural
being, nor to any of the properties which belong to the objects of our senses.
Seeing, from this part of our definition, what the spiritual sense is not, if we
should detect anything which relates to the personal condition of man, to out
ward events, or to any of the properties of nature, we may be sure that we have
not arrived at a clear conception of the limits of the two senses, but have been
confounding them together. The spiritual sense is exclusively confined to
man's spiritual condition, embracing within its circuit every possible state of the
human mind, both in that arrangement and subordination of its powers to the
Divine Will which are to fit man for the kingdom of heaven, and in that disar
rangement and insubordination of the mind by the love of evil, which are the
sure and only sources of his eternal misery. The spiritual sense of the Holy
Scripture is a history of the indefinitely various states of the human mind ; con
sisting of a series of truths, universal, as all truths are which are abstracted from
space and time, and therefore applicable to all mankind in all ages of the world.
These conditions of the mind, that is, of the will and the intellect, are called the
states of the church, or of the kingdom of God in man. Our first step must be to
have it well impressed upon our minds, that the natural sense relates, generally
speaking, to the circumstances, conditions, and duties of man externally, or in
nature, and also to the different forms, properties, and relations which belong to
the objects of nature ; and that the spiritual sense relates to the various states of
man's spirit, that is, of his will in the quality of the love which animates
it,
and
of his intellect in the quality of its knowledge." —p. 2.
It
would doubtless be desirable, in this connection, to adduce an array of pas
sages from the Arcana illustrative of the peculiar genius of the commentary —
so immensly diverse from all others—which Swedenborg affords upon the books
of Genesis and Exodus, and incidentally upon nearly every other portion of the
Word. But as this would draw too largely upon my space,
I
will endeavor to
accomplish the object by a different method. Taking the Index to that work,
and turning to the article Truth, which alone occupies eleven pages, referring
probably to upwards of one thousand sections,
I
will extract a sufficient portion
of
it
to give you some idea of the general vein of exposition which distinguishes
not this only, but every part of that amazing store-house of spiritual wisdom.
And
I
would especially ask your attention to the drift of the discussions indicated
by the topical heads in connection with your own idea of Swedenborg's state as
that of a man who had unfortunately became insane upon religious subjects.
I
have no small curiosity to know which of the items specified you would fix up
on as savoring, from the import, of the hallucination of a mind deranged. The
figures you will of course understand as referring to the paragraphs of the Ar
cana.
If
the volumes should be accessible, and you should be disposed to turn
to some of the passages cited, and see how the topics are treated,
I
think
I
may
assure you of finding a vast increase of difficulty attending the supposition, that
such sentiments should have emanated from an unsettled intellect.

74 REPLY TO DR. WOODS.
full justice to the manner in which he intellectualises and spiritualises the plainest
historical details, and that too, not in accordance with the impulses of a vagari
ous fancy, but with the teachings of an invariable law—invariable to his percep
tions, though not always, I admit, to ours. We may be unable in all cases to per
ceive precisely how certain moral instructions flow directly from the passages
from which he elicits them, but we can usually perceive the intrinsic truth and
weightiness of the lessons in themselves considered. Thus, for instance, in re
spect to a single item noted above— that, "rational truth without good is morose"
—it may be well to adduce a few sentences to illustrate the manner in which he
treats the subject and which may serve also as a specimen of his general man
ner. He is speaking of Ishmael.
" The wild-ass is a mule of the wilderness, or an ass of the forest; and it sig
nifies the rational of man, not the rational in its complex, but only rational truth.
The rational consists of good and of truth, that is, of those things which are of
charity, and of those things which are of faith : rational truth is that which is sig
nified by the wild-ass. This then is what is represented by Ishmael, and is des
cribed in this verse. No one can believe that rational truth separate from rational
good is such, nor should I have known it to be such, unless instructed by lively
experience. It is the same thing whether we speak of rational truth, or of a
man whose rational is of such a nature : a man, whose rational is such that he
is only in truth, although in the truth of faith and not at the same time in the
good of charity, is altogether of this character : he is morose, impatient, opposite
to all others, viewing every one as in the false, instantly rebuking, chastising,
and punishing : he is without pity, neither does he apply himself and endeavor
to bend the minds of others : for he regards everything from truth, and nothing
from good. Every genuine rational consists of good and truth, that is, of the
celestial and spiritual : good, or the celestial, is its very soul or life ; truth, or the
spiritual, is what thence receives its life. The rational without life from celes
tial good, is as is here described, viz., it fights against all, and all fight against it.
Rational good never fights, howsoever it is assaulted, because it is meek and
gentle, patient and yielding, for it is of love and mercy : and although it does not
fight, yet it conquers all, never thinking of combat, or boasting of victory : and
this because it is divine, and is safe of itself. For no evil can assault good, nor
even subsist in the sphere where good is : if it only feels its approximation it
recedes of itself and retires : for evil is infernal, and good is celestial." —A. C.
1949, 1950.
Again in speaking in another place of the essential life of truth he says :—
" In order to constitute a truth, there must be life in it, for truth without life is
not the truth of faith appertaining to man, and life is from no other source than
from good, that is, by [or through] good from the Lord; if therefore the Lord be
not in a truth, it is a truth without life, thus not true ; but if the false be in it, or
evil, the truth itself appertaining to man is false or evil ; for what is within, this
constitutes the essence, and also in the other life is translucent through what is
external. From these considerations now it may be manifest how it is to be
understood, that truths ought not to be thought of from any other source than
from the Lord. Inasmuch as few know how the case is with truths which in
the internal form are truths, thus which live from the Lord, it may be expedient
to say something on the subject from experience : in the other life it is manifestly
perceived by every one who speaks there, what is inwardly stored up in the
words of his speech, as whether it be closed within, or whether it be open, also
what kind of affection is in it; if the affection of good be in it, it is inwardly soft,
if the affection of evil, it is inwardly hard, and so forth. With the angels of hea
ven, all things of their discourse are open even to the Lord, which is both clearly
perceived and is also heard from its softness and the quality thereof; hence also
it is known what lies stored up within in truths, whether the Lord or not ; the
truths in which the Lord is, are truths which are alive, but the truths in which

the Lord is not, are truths which are not alive ; those which are alive are the
truths of faith grounded in love to the Lord, and in charity towards the neigh
bor; those which are not alive are not truths, because inwardly in them is
self-love and the love of the world. Spirits and angels in the other life may
hereby be discerned, for every one hath truths according to his life, that is, ac
cording to what universally reigns with him." —A. C. 8868.
Now in respect to the first of these extracts, I readily grant that it is not easily
apprehensible why Ishmael as a wild ass should convey to a spiritual perception
the idea of rational truth, although if you consult the whole section you will see
that he cites a number of passages in which the term " wild ass" must have some
other than the literal sense, or it makes nonsense. But no one, I think, will refuse
to admit that the sentiment educed is one intrinsically of great practical moment
and every way worthy of the source from which he professes to derive it ; nor do
I see how any one can help acknowledging, that provided such senses can be le
gitimately drawn from the historical portions of the Word it becomes indeed a
treasury of divine wisdom of which he had before but a very faint conception.
Now on this head his espousers, one and all, profess to be entirely satisfied,
and that too for the most adequate reasons. As a supernatural illumination is plain
ly requisite to authenticate such recondite senses of the Word, so the illumina
tion needs to be equally authenticated by its appropriate evidences. This they
are assured has been amply done, though I am not at present engaged in dilat
ing upon the various grounds on which their conviction rests. But they are fully
persuaded upon what is, to them, abundant evidence, that the requisite illumi
nation has been imparted to Swedenborg for the express purpose of solving the
enigmas of the Word, and that too by restoring the lost science of Correspondences.
This science was undoubtedly well known in the most ancient eras of the
Church, and the Hieroglyphics of Egypt and the East are the obscure vestiges of
a graud system of the interpretation of Nature, which universally prevailed in
the first ages. Even the present figurative style of Asiatic literature owes its ori
gin to the same source. But as man degenerated from the purity and lucidity of
his primeval state, he gradually lost his perception of the spiritual causes of nat
ural things, and from worshiping the divine things signified by the visible signs,
he began to worship the signs themselves, and thus opened the flood-gates of
idolatry upon the world. As idolatry came in, the knowledge of corresponden
ces went out, and the science was in abeyance till Swedenborg arose and be
came the instrument of restoring it again to men. For this end his interior senses
were opened —he was elevated into the spiritual sphere, the sphere of causes —
and thence was enabled to reveal the hidden purport of the names of all the nat
ural objects mentioned in the Word, and through which its spiritual truths are
conveyed. We receive the expositions which he has given, even where we are
unable clearly to perceive their intrinsic aptitude to express the ideas intended,
because we believe he has afforded sufficient evidence of his illumination.
You will see from this, without farther explanation, the manner in which we
should of course entertain the suggestions made in the following paragraph from
your work.
" Now suppose I should admit the truth of what are considered the essential
psychological or spiritual principles of the system ; how would it follow from

denote periods of time, but states and circumstances of those ante-diluvian
churches, and the whole account there given of the successive generations of
men, and of the events which took place before the deluge and at the time of
the deluge, instead of being what it professes to be, an account of historical ve
rities, is a mere allegory, intended, like Bunyan's story of the Pilgrim, to convey
a moral or spiritual sense ? Swedenborg himself teaches, that these and many
other things contained in his writings, could never have been known, had not
the Lord opened his interior sight, and enabled him to see and know things
which were utterly beyond the discovery of the human mind without supernat
ural illumination. And as Swedenborg never thought, that a supernatural sight
would be the common privilege of the generations which would follow him, he
must have expected that they would receive his disclosures on the ground of
his authority. According to the spirit of his own repeated declarations, there
was no other way for men to know the things which he revealed, but by avail
ing themselves of his supernatural illumination, and relying implicitly on his au
thority."— p. 49.
We are not alarmed by the apparent dilemma in which you appear to consider
us entangled. It is to us very much the same as information from Egypt or
China is to you. Although you never visited either of these countries, yet you
do not hesitate to receive the testimony of travellers respecting them, provided
you have satisfied yourself as to their claims to credence. You would be far from
insisting that they should give you internal evidence of the truth of every item
of their reports concerning the laws, arts, manners, language, institutions, and
monuments of the people. In the case of Swedenborg's interpretations, how
ever, we do not regard ourselves as cut off entirely from internal evidence. A
very considerable portion of them are of such a nature that, as soon as the fun
damental principle is announced, they at once approve themselves to our rea
son as true. This naturally lays a foundation for confidence in his testimony on
points that are not at present intellectually seen to be true, but which are at the
same time in accordance with, or the result of, principles and facts about which
the mind feels itself assured.
I deem
it,
however, no more than fair to acknowledge that precisely here
is
the point where the largest draft
is
made upon our assent —the point of nearest
approach to what might be termed an implicit reliance on his averments. In
all that he has taught of the state and condition of departed souls —of the facts
and phenomena of the world unseen—we perceive
a
certain ground of intrinsic
probability and such
a
difficulty of conceiving otherwise, that we can scarcely be
said to take
it
wholly upon trust. When once the clew
is
given us by his al
leged disclosures, the deductions of our reason seem to bring us inevitably to
the same results. But when we come to the biblical interpretations, we feel, in
regard to many of them, more like one who
is
led by the hand in the dark,
though we still find
it
easy to justify to ourselves the most unbounded confidence
in our guide. Even he himself has taught us to believe that the recognition of
his truth depends very much on the development of the spiritual nature—ihe
moral element—within us, which stands in the most intimate relation with the
spiritual sense. This interior perception does not come, in our opinion, so
properly within the domain of the purely rational faculty, however highly cub
tivated. As Truth
is
evermore truly seen from Good, so a heavenly Life
is
the
grand requisite to deep spiritual insight. Such an instinctive perception as

life —and that it will be again enjoyed at a future day, when the church shall be
restored to its primeval purity and clearness of vision. There will then, we
think, be little difficulty in apprehending the soundness of Swedenborg's most
recondite interpretations. What might we not anticipate on this score from a
general state of the inner man even approximating to that which is described in
the following extract.
" There was to the man of the Most Ancient Church no other worship than
internal, such as there is in heaven, for with them heaven communicated with
man, so that they made a one ; that communication was perception, concerning
which much has been said above : thus being angelic men, they were also in
ternal men ; they perceived indeed, by sensation, the external things relating to
the body and the world, but they cared not for them : in every object of sense
they perceived somewhat divine and celestial ; as for example, when they saw
any high mountain, they did not perceive the idea of a mountain, but of height,
and from height they had a perception of heaven and the Lord ; hence it came
to pass that the Lord was said to dwell on high, and He Himself was called the
Highest and Most Exalted, and afterwards the worship of the Lord was solemn
ized on mountains : the case was similar in other instances ; as when they per
ceived the morning, they did not perceive the morning itself of the day, but the
celestial, which is like the morning and day-dawn in the mind ; hence the Lord
was called the Morning, the East, and the Dawn : in like manner when they
saw a tree, with its fruits and leaves, they did not attend to them, but saw as it
were man represented therein, in the fruit love and charity, in the leaves faith ;
hence also the man of the church was not only compared to a tree, and likewise
to a paradise, and the things in man to fruit and leaves, but they were also so
called. Such are they who are in a celestial and angelic idea. Every one may
apprehend that the general idea rules all the particulars, thus all the objects of
the senses, as well what is seen as what is heard, and indeed in such a manner,
that the objects are not at all cared for, but so far as they flow into the general
idea ; thus to him who is joyful in mind, whatever is heard or seen appears joy
ful and smiling; but if the mind be affected with sorrow, whatever is heard or
seen appears sad and sorrowful ; so in all other cases ; for the general affection
is in particulars, and causes them to be seen and heard in the general affection ;
other things do not even appear, but are as if they were absent, or as nothing.
This was the case with the man of the Most Ancient Church ; whatever he saw
with his eyes was to him celestial ; and thus with him all things and each, were
as if they were alive. Hence may appear what was the nature and quality of
his divine worship, that it was internal, and in no respect external. But when
the Church declined, as it did with the posterity, and when that perception or
communication with heaven began to perish, then the case began to be other
wise : in sensible objects men no longer perceived what was celestial, as be
fore, but what was worldly, and this in a greater degree, as they had less of per
ception remaining ; till at length, in the last posterity, which was next before
the flood, they apprehended nothing in sensible objects but what was worldly,
corporeal, and terrestrial; —thus heaven was separated from man, and he had
none but very remote communication therewith." —A. C. 920.
We can hardly resist the inference, from the general tenor of Swedenborg's
teachings, that there is a knowledge of nature intuitive to a right state of the mo
ral affections far superior to that achieved by the science of thelntellect. In this
fact we have doubtless the true key to the problem found in the character of
some of the philosophies which we term ancient. It has often been a question
with the learned how Plato and Pythagoras, for instance, should have stumbled
upon so much truth. But suppose, for a moment, that their systems were but
the fragmentary relics of a still more ancient wisdom, which flowed, as it were,
spontaneously from a higher state of the moral man, and the enigma is solved.
This wisdom was, in fact, the wisdom of correspondence, or of the relation of the

natural to the spiritual world. The pride of modern science may be humiliated
by the intimation, but the acknowledgment of the fact is merely putting its due
honor upon the principles of Goodness in comparison with mere Intellect. We
have reversed the true order, and the effect has been to blind us to the reality of
the perversion. But this is a vein of thought which I cannot now pursue.
With one who has fully acquainted himself with Swedenborg's multifarious
developements, the evidence of truth is so imperative in regard to an immense
variety of points which his reason and his consciousness are able to certify, that
he is content to receive other matters on the strength of a veracity which has
never failed him, so far as he had the means of putting it to the test. He rests in
the inward assurance that the same reasons which prevailed with the Most High
for granting him admission into the spiritual world at all, required also that what
ever he reported thence should be entitled to the most absolute reliance.
No persons, however, can be more deeply sensible than the members of
the New Church, how much is involved in the admission of this high claim
on the part of their revered teacher. The very fact, indeed, that it con
cedes so much to a human being in this age of the world, shows how powerful
and prevailing has been the evidence that has convinced them. They will
doubtless be ready, one and all, to say, that they were, at the outset— on the first
annunciation of his doctrines— as much startled by them, perhaps as much op
posed to them, as any one who now rejects them with no more knowledge of
their peculiar character than they then possessed. But they read and pondered.
They were struck, they were surprised, they were amazed, at the coincidence
between his revelations and their own inner intuitions. Especially were they
wrought upon by the searching and penetrating power of his expose of the deep
est principles of their nature. They found themselves strangely sifted and ex
plored —their most hidden promptings and purposes laid open—the nicest con
ceivable distinctions drawn in regard to those mental and moral elements which
are the spring of actions —as if every form and phase of character became trans
parent under his luminous development. Most deeply, moreover, were they
impressed to find that notwithstanding his assertion of a supernatural insight
into the truth of things, both in this world and the next, he still makes his ap
peal to the tribunal of reason, and protests with all earnestness against his read
er's receiving anything for truth of which he does not see a rational evidence.
The more they penetrated into the depths of his doctrines, the more were they
astonished to find their visionary character disappear, and the strangest disclo
sures to assume the air of the soundest reason. Proceeding onward to a more
accurate study of the genius and endowments of the man, they were smitten
with wonder at the gigantic grasp of his intellect, capacious at once of the vast
and the minute —at the universality of his scientific attainments —at the unrivalled
logical precision of his reasoning —at the symmetry of his method —at the sim
plicity, clearness, and condensation of his style—and at the exuberant richness
of illustration ; which throws a glow over his argument without weakening its
force or diverting attention from its scope. The more, in fact, they have learned
of the intellectual and moral attributes of the great apostle of the New Dispen
sation, the more deeply grounded is their conviction of his pre- eminent qualifi
cations for the high office he was called to sustain, so that they are ready at once
to pronounce it as their calm and intelligent assurance, that were his various en

dowments known as they know them, they would be appreciated as they appre
ciate them, and that if it had been left to the choice of the collective humanity
of the race to select from their number an individual who should be made the
medium and depository of these stupendous revelations for the benefit of his kind,
the election would have fallen without a dissenting voice, upon the very man
whom the Divine Providence actually set apart for the purpose. Nothing is
more evident to a close survey of his personal history, than that his whole life,
prior to his illumination, was a continued course of unconscious preparation for
the work which he was destined to perform, nor is it easy to conceive of a hu
man being more thoroughly accomplished for a function so sacred and grand.
On the score of transcend ant intellect and the highest moral worth, everything is
as it should be to meet the demands of the case.
I have adverted to these considerations with a view to justify the unlimited
confidence reposed by the adherents of the New Church in the spiritual interpret
ations given by Swedenborg to the Word. They have the most undoubting as
surance that this sense builds itself on the constitutional structure of the human
mind as related to the very laws of creation, and which finds its full manifesta
tion in the spiritual world. That he was actually intromitted into that world,
and has made a truthful report of its phenomena, they have not the slightest
question ; because as far as his statements can be verified to consciousness and
reason, they are verified, and why should they hesitate to receive his testimony
when experience fails ? Even that measure of truth which we are able to au
thenticate by our own inductions depends upon moral conditions in the medium
which, in our view, are wholly inconsistent with the idea of anything apocry
phal in the remaining departments of his revelations.
But before entirely dismissing the present subject I would advert for a few
moments, to an objection which may be, and has been, urged against the doc
trine of the spiritual sense on the ground of the cut bono. Why, it is asked, if the
literal sense is capable of being translated, as it is by Swedenborg, into spiritual
language —why was not that language originally adopted for the purpose ? Was
it not as easy for the Spirit who dictated the Scriptures to have couched his rev
elations, in the first instance, in that form of expression into which the actual
form must be rendered before it can be adequately understood? This would
doubtless seem, at first blush, a weighty objection, but it is fully answered on
the ground of the principles on which the whole theory rests.
" Truth Divine is not received by any one, unless it be accommodated to the
apprehension, consequently unless it appear in a natural form and species ;
for human minds at first apprehend none but terrestrial and worldly things, and
not at all spiritual and celestial things, wherefore if spiritual and celestial things
were exposed nakedly, they would be rejected as if they were nothing, accord
ing to the Lord's words in John, ' If I have told you earthly things and ye be
lieve not, how should ye believe if I should tell you super-celestial things,' iii.
12 ; this was particularly the case with those who lived before the coming of
the Lord, who at length were in such blindness, that they knew nothing, be
cause they were not willing to know anything concerning the life after death,
concerning the internal man, concerning charity and faith, and concerning any
thing celestial, which things they rejected, because they held them in aversion ;
for they who regard terrestrial and worldly things as an end, that is, who love
them above all things, hold spiritual things in aversion, and almost abhor the
very name of them ; the case is nearly the same at this day ; the learned of the
world indeed believe, that they should receive the Word more favorably, if ce

plicity ; but they are very much deceived, for in such case they would have re
jected it more than the si mple, and would have seen in it no light, but mere gross
darkness; for human learning induces this darkness with those who trust to
their own intelligence, and on that account extol themselves above others." —A.

He elsewhere teaches, with great explicitness,that the literal sense is the ba
sis, continent, and support of the spiritual sense, and that as the connection of
the two is by correspondences, and correspondences are the medium of con
junction between heaven and earth,? if the literal sense were wanting,
—" The Word would be like a palace without a foundation ; that is, like a
palace in the air and not on the ground, which could only be the shadow of a
palace, and must vanish away, also, that the Word, without its literal sense,
would be like a temple in which are many holy things, and in the midst thereof
the holy of holies, without a roof and walls to form the continents thereof ; in
which case its holy things would be plundered by theives, or be violated by the
beasts of the earth and the birds of heaven, and thus be dissipated. In the same
manner, it would be like the tabernacle, in the inmost place whereof was the
ark of the covenant, and in the middle part the golden candlestick, the golden
altar for incense, and also the table for shew-bread, which were its holy things,
without its ultimates, which were the curtains and vails. Yea, the Word with
out its literal sense would be like the human body without its coverings, which
are called skins, and without its supporters, which are called bones, of which,
supposing it to be deprived, its inner parts must of necessity be dispersed and
perish. It would also be like the heart and the lungs in the thorax, deprived of
their covering, which is called the pleura, and their supporters, which are called
the ribs; or like the brain without its coverings, which are called the dura and
pia mater, and without its common covering, continent and firmament, which is
called the skull. Such would be the state of the Word without its literal sense;
wherefore it is said in Isaiah, that '
the Lord will create upon all the glory a
covering' (iv. 5)."—D. S. S. 33.
I give another extract in this connection describing still more fully the philos
ophy of the literal and spiritual sense.
"The reason why this literal sense is called a cloud is, because it is in obscurity
in respect to the internal sense, for this latter is in the light of heaven; the rea
son why it is in obscurity and like a cloud is, because it is for man during his
abode in the world, whereas the internal sense is for man when he comes into
heaven : but it is to be noted that man, during his abode in the world, is at the
same time in the internal sense of the Word, when he is in the genuine doctrine of
the Church as to faith and as to life, for by that doctrine the internal sense of the
Word is then inscribed both on his understanding and his will, on his understand
ing, by faith, and on his will by life. Such a man, when he comes into heaven, ap
prehends the Word no otherwise than entirely according to its internal sense, and
knows nothing of its external sense, this latter appearing to him at that time as a
cloud that absorbs the rays of his light. It is said that man then apprehends the
Word according to its internal sense, and not according to its external sense ; the
reason of this is, because all, who are in heaven, are instructed by the Lord from
Truth Divine which appertains to man, thus from the Word ; the reason is, be-
* " The Word is written by mere correspondences, and hence it is of such a quality as
to conjoin in heaven with man ; for heaven is in the written sense of the Word, and the
internal sense corresponds to the external sense, wherefore, where the Word is read by
men, the angels, who are attendant upon him, perceive it in the spiritual sense, which
is the internal sense, hence a holy principle from the angels flows-in, by which there is

cause man is in the ultimate of order, and all interior things close in the ulti
mate, the ultimate being as it were a prop [or support] to things interior, on
which the latter subsist and rest. The Word in the letter is Divine Truth in the
ultimate of order, in like manner the man of the Church, to whom Divine Truth
appertains, as to his natural and sensual principle ; in this latter, as in the for
mer, interior things terminate and rest. They are as a house and its foundation ;
the house itself is heaven, and Divine Truth there such as the Word is as to the in
ternal sense, and the foundation is the world, and Divine Truth there such as the
Word is in the external sense. As a house rests on its foundation, so also heav
en on the Church, consequently the Divine Truth in heaven upon the Divine
Truth in earth ; for there is a continual connexion from the Lord through heaven
even to man by the Word. This is the reason why it is always provided by the
Lord, that there may be a Church on earth, where Divine Truth may be in its
ultimate. This is an arcanum which no one as yet knows. Let all therefore
take heed to themselves, lest they injure the Word by any means, for they who
injure the Word, injure the Divine [principle] itself."— A C. 9430.
I have thus endeavored to unfold, by the light of Swedenborg's own explana
tions, the peculiar genius of the spiritual sense of the Word. It is doubtless the
prominent feature of the system, and that against which objections are urged in
the greatest number and with the most confidence. But they have invariably
shot wide of the principle which forms the foundation of the theory. Yet the
theory is surely entitled to be' judged by its distinguishing principle- If this be
erroneous, the fallacy would seem to be capable of being detected and pointed
out. I am not aware that this has either been done or attempted. Though con
siderably conversant with all the works which have been published in opposi
tion to the system of Swedenborg, I know not of a single one which has assumed
to meet the argument on its true merits. They invariably blink the real question
at issue, and instead of encountering the principle, aim their assaults entirely at
the application. Of this we justly complain. Our belief in the soundness of the
applications rests altogether in the soundness of the fundamental principle.
Why is not this worthy of consideration ? It lays claim to the character of reason,
science, and philosophy, and I can scarcely imagine any problem in Swedenborg
that should seem more staggering to a non-recipient of his views, than is that
which we find in this unanimous refusal to entertain the radical principle which
lies at the basis of his biblical revelations. The matter would be somewhat alle
viated, if even a reason were assigned for thus declining to meet his adherents
on the only ground on which they claim to be met ; for it is on the fundamental
principles of the system that their assent to it has been yielded. How then is it
possible that any arguments should have weight with them which pay no at
tention to these principles ?
I am certainly reluctant to be forced to recognize the operation of moral causes
in the procedure to which I now advert. I do not venture to charge upon our
opponents the conscious influence of any other than intellectual considerations in
prompting the objections urged against the interior purport of the Word. But
I know not that I shall wrong any one by citing two or three passages from Swe
denborg himself, in which he very clearly intimates the existence of a latent .
aversion in many minds to the acknowledgment of any sense in the Word be
yond that of the letter.

according to the faculty of receiving, they who are in illustration, as to their in
ternal man are in the Sight of heaven; for the light of heaven is what illustrates
man in the truths and goods of faith. They who are thus illuminated, appre
hend the Word as to its interiors ; wherefore they from the W ord make to them
selves doctrine, to which they apply the sense of the letter : but they who are
not in the affection of truth from good, and thence in the desire of growing
wise, are more blinded than illustrated when they read the Word, for they are
not in the light of heaven ; and from the light of the world, which is called the
lumen of nature, they see only such things as are in agreement with worldly
things, and thus from the fallacies, in which the external senses are, they lay
hold of falses, which appear to them as truths. Hence the generality of them
make to themselves no doctrine, but abide in the sense of the letter, which they
apply to favor falses, especially such as are in agreement with the loves of self
and of the world ; but they who are not of this character, merely confirm the
doctrinals of their own Church, and are not concerned, neither do they know,
whether they be true or false."—A. C. 9382.
" There are spirits who are in other respects good, but who cannot as yet be
admitted into heaven, because they are not willing to hear and to admit the in
terior, and still less the more interior, things of the Word ; and who, on this ac
count, thought evil against me and interpreted what I said in an evil sense. For
those who do not approve internal things, cannot learn those things which belong
to the interior and internal man; for they are ignorant that there are interior
things, still less do they know that things more interior exist ; hence, in respect to
works of faith, they call those good which are done by good men, in obedience
to the Word, and from a good heart. But when they are told that good works
must be works of charity, and that charity is of mercy, and thus from the Lord
the Saviour, they admit that it is so, but "they do not think so profoundly as to
see that it is so. Such spirits, therefore, as cannot as yet admit interior truths,
cannot as yet be introduced by the way of knowledge [even] into the exterior
heaven.
" Moreover, such as will not at all hear or admit of interior things, remain out
of heaven, nor can they do otherwise than hate such things, because they are
more or less interior, and also those who teach them. As upon earth there will,
as I think, be many who will hate the interior and more inward things of the
Word, because they more closely touch the life of their love, in favor of which
they object to certain difficulties which appear to them as impossible to be ex
plained ; thus they rather prefer that the way to interior things should be closed
against them, than that they should favor them by their assent; besides this,
they are not willing to be disquieted by such things as they assert they are not
capable of understanding.
" Such spirits have very often conversed with me, and have frequently re
proached me for teaching interior things, because such things appeared as para
doxical to them ; and also some this day who were of a similar character, and
who on that account thought ill of the acts of my life. In a word, at the present
time the heaven of spirits is almost filled with such ;—but it is otherwise with
all such as are in heaven." — S. D. 1139-1141.
This may well be supposed if that is true which follows :
" All in the spiritual world, who are inwardly evil, how moral soever their
external life in the world has been, cannot at all bear any one who adores the
Lord, and lives a life of charity ; as soon as they see such persons, they infest
and injure or treat them opprobriously. I have frequently wondered at this cir
cumstance, as also all must do who are unacquainted with
it,
inasmuch as the
same persons, when in the world, could bear to hear preachings concerning the
Lord, and also concerning charity, and even spoke doctrinally upon such things
themselves, and yet when they become spirits they cannot bear them
;
the rea
son however is, because this aversion
is
implanted or inherent in the evil in
which they are immersed; for in their evil there exists enmity, yea, hatred
against the Lord, and also against those who are led by the Lord, that is, who are
in the life of charity; but this enmity and hatred lies concealed in their spirit

wherefore they are in them when they become spirits, and then is disclosed that

I have already remarked that persons in this state are not necessarily aware
of the fact. They would not consciously reject the spiritual and internal things
of the Word simply because they are such ; but it may still be suggested whether
it is -not possible, that upon a rigid inquest into themselves, they might detect a
hidden disrelish of the interior sense of the Scriptures as bearing upon the in
terior life and soul of their affections. So, on the other hand, when the spir
itual state is intrinsically good, there may be an equally unconscious reception
of the essential verities of the internal sense.
" The doctrine, which should be for a lamp, is what the internal sense
teaches, thus it is the internal sense itself, which in some measure is evident to
every one, although he is ignorant what the internal sense is, who is in the ex
ternal from the internal, that is, to whom the internal man is open ; for heaven,
which is in the internal sense of the Word, flows-iu with that man when he
reads the Word, enlightens him, and gives him perception, and thereby teaches
him : yea, if ye are willing to believe, the internal man appertaining to man is
of itself in the internal sense of the Word, since it is heaven in the least effigy,
and hence is with angels in heaven when it is open, wherefore also it is in like
perception with them ; which also may be manifest from this consideration,
that the interior intellectual ideas of man are not such as his natural ideas are,
to which nevertheless they correspond ; but of what quality they are, man is ig
norant so long as he lives in the body, yet he comes into them spontaneously
when he comes into the other life, because they are ingrafted, and by them he is
instantly in consort with the angels. Hence it is evident that man, whose inter
nal is open, is in the internal sense of the Word, although he is ignorant of it ;
hence he has illustration when he reads the Word, but according to the light
which he is capable of having by means of the knowledges appertaining to
him."—A. C. 10,400.
I have now accomplished what I designed in reference to the most important
part of your strictures upon the system of revelation which Swedenborg has in-
strumentally given to the world. Although the subject is by no means exhaust
ed, yet I may perhaps presume to think that its most prominent points are pre
sented in tolerably full relief, so that our true position, in respect to the main
theme, can scarcely be henceforth mistaken. We profess to be able to assign a
rational and philosophical reason for the credence which we give to the truth,
soundness, and sobriety of those interpretations of the inspired Word which seem
to strike you and others as the climax of extravagance and absurdity. That the
evidence which satisfies us on this head will also satisfy you, 1 dare not venture
to anticipate. I have too clear a perception —acquired mainly from the con

mould the forms of theological opinion, to conceive it as in the least probable,
that the confirmations of a long tract of years, consolidated and strengthened
by powerful circumstances of place, name, association, and commitment, shall
give way before the strange and startling claims of a body of disclosures pro
fessedly emanating from the spiritual world and bearing the seal of divine au
thority. Even though it appeals to internal evidence— relying exclusively for
reception on its accordance with the clearest judgment and intuitions of the rea

of mind formed by the prevailing dogmas of the church, the sustaining evidence
of its truth shall be utterly powerless in producing conviction. The teachings of
these doctrines themselves enable us to solve every apparent problem of this na
ture, and more especially as it respects the peculiar feature of the scheme upon
which I have so fully dwelt. Instructed as we are in the close and indissoluble
connection between the spiritual sense and the spiritual world, we can easily un
derstand how a dominant incredulity as to all extraordinary insight in the one de
partment shall effectually bar the admission of any special illumination in the
other. Yet whatever may be the result, I shall by no means deem it lost labor
to have presented the subject as I have done above, as it has enabled me clearly
to define our position, and to show the exact point on which the issue between us
and our censors is to be joined. It has also afforded me an opportunity to spread
fairly before the reader a series of interesting and important extracts from Swe-
denborg himself, of which it may be presumed a tolerably wide perusal will be
secured. This is always gratifying to a New Churchman, as he cannot but in
dulge the belief that the undefinable something —the ineffable air and character —
which breathes through his pages, will strike others in some degree as it strikes
them. So far from being able to conceive that they offer indications of a mind
unhinged, they can scarcely imagine any attribute of the soundest and profound -
est intellect which does not display itself in his writings, to say nothing of the
vein of simplicity, sincerity, and deep religious reverence, which pervades every
sentence. But he can have lived and observed to very little purpose who has
not learnt the power of adverse preconception to neutralise and nullify the
strongest evidence of truth. Our assurance, therefore, of the intrinsically impreg
nable strength of our position is by no means the measure of our confidence in
the conquests they shall win over the rooted skepticism of the Christian mind.
We can only say to ourselves, respecting our faith, as our illumined teacher says
of some point which he is' arguing with irresistible force in the face of opponents

LETTER VI.
Rev. and Dear Sir :
It is very much of a settled principle with the adherents of Swedenborg, that
it is absolutely impossible to report the evidence of the truth of his disclosures.
It must be seen by its own light in the works in which it is embodied. I pre
sume it will be confidently said by every present receiver of the system, who
has not imbibed it from childhood, that nothing but the actual perusal of the writ
ings could, by any possibility, have wrought the conviction which has sprung
up in his mind. If interrogated as to what it is, precisely, in these writings to
which the effect is owing, they will perhaps be unable to give a more definite
answer than to say, that it is a certain indescribable coincidence between their
teachings and the deductions, intuitions, and, more than all. the sentiments, of
their own minds. They find in them a wonderful response to the voice of their
inmost souls, of which they can convey no more fitting idea than by referring
to the effect of the Christian Scriptures upon the mind of a skeptical inquirer.

You will doubtless agree with me that there is no possible process of reasoning
—no presentation of evidence —so likely to prevail with an infidel in proof of the
truth of Christianity, as a candid perusal of the documents of our faith, contained
in the New Testament. If conviction fails to be the result in such a case, you
cannot but doubt as to the presence of the condition —candor. At any rate you
have but little hope of a favorable issue from any other source. If John and
Matthew and Paul fail to impress him, you can place but little reliance on Paley
and Watson and Chalmers. So in regard to Swedenborg. He must be read in or
der to be believed. I repeat it with all emphasis, that nothing but the actual peru
sal of his works in his own words will, in one case in ten thousand, produce the
conviction of his truth ; and when this is done, in a spirit of candor, I cannot
conceive that in one case in ten thousand it should not produce this effect. This
persuasion grows out of my view of the very structure and laws of the human
mind. I confess myself utterly unable to imagine that your verdict on the sub
ject should be different from mine, provided we are both in possession of the
same premises, and both are governed by an equally sincere and simple-hearted
desire to ascertain the truth of God. The only reason, as I conceive, why I have
embraced the system and you have not, is because I have read more and pon
dered more on the subject, and because, from circumstances for which I take no
credit, my mind is more free from influences adverse to reception. But however
this may be, I am positively certain that in my own case belief has followed
knowledge. On no point is my assurance more firm than that, without reading
Swedenborg, not entire, but extensively, I never could have received his doc
trines, for from no other source could I ever have felt the force of the evidence by
which they are sustained.
I could therefore wish it to be distinctly understood, that the grand scope of
the work in which I am now engaged is not so much to establish affirmatively
the truth of his system, as to repel the force of objections against it. The one
can be done independently of the other. Nor do I doubt that confirmations,
more or less strong, in support of the system may be drawn from the develop
ments of various sciences, especially physiology and psychology. But in gene
ral, the proof positive must come from the revelations themselves as Swedenborg
lias given them. No amount of writing about them will stand in the place of the
actual reading of them. Sketches, compends, extracts, all fail to produce the effect.
They are to the system what a herbarium is to a garden. The living doctrines
must be studied in the books in which they are embodied. We can only say,
with the Mystic Animal of the Apocalypse, when the sealed book is opened,
" Come and see."
But while I essay, not so much in these letters, to array the arguments going
to prove that the system is true, the attempt is legitimate to show that those
urged against it do not prove that it is not true ; and in this attempt I am brought
to the chapter in your work in which you offer a series of "Hints as to Sweden-
borg's visionary state —his revelations —visits to the planets," &c. The term
'' visionary," in ordinary usage, has very much the import of fanciful or fantastic,
and though I am strongly impressed that you intended it to bear, in this connec
tion, an invidious sense, yet as " visionary state
" may also imply a state of re
ceiving visions, such as Swedenborg affirms were vouchsafed to him, I shall not at
present debate the propriety of the phrase. The " hints " are the main things to
be considered. Your opening on this head is as follows :

86 REPLY TO DR. WOODS.
" We are now to consider the visions of Swedenborg, or the revelations made to him
in the world of spirits. He says, that his interiors were opened, and that he saw
things in the other world, and had free conference with the inhabitants for a long
course of years. And, in different parts of his writings, he gives us particular
relations, which he calls "memorable relations," of what he saw and heard, and
what he himself said, in his intercourse with the world of spirits. He says, he
saw and heard the things related, not in sleep, but when he was wide awake.
And what is very marvellous, he had intercourse with men and things in this
world, as we commonly do, at the same time that his interiors, i. e. the powers
of his spirit, or, as the transcendentalists say, the depths ofhis being, were opened,
so that he was conversant with the affairs of the three heavens, and also of the
hells.
" And here let me advertise you, that I feel myself under no obligation to ac
count for the state of mind which Swedenborg had, or for the things which are
set forth in his memorable relations. Various inquiries naturally present themselves
to our consideration, among which are the following, namely, whether Sweden
borg was really under a supernatural influence, and whether in consequence of
this, his teachings in regard to the Scriptures and the things of heaven and hell
are clothed with divine authority and are binding upon our faith ; or whether he
was in a state similar to what is produced by Animal Magnetism, or Mesmerism ;
or whether he was the subject of a remarkable kind of insanity. I shall not turn
aside from my present object so much, as to attempt to give a definite reply to
these inquiries. My purpose is, to proceed according to the direction of the
ablest advocates of Swedenborg, and to look directly at the nature of his com
munications. If they appear to possess an intrinsic excellence, and to be consistent
with our settled views of the word and works of God, they ought to be cordially
received ; if otherwise, to be rejected. Or if there is found to be a mixture of
truth and error, the truth is to be received, and the error rejected."—p. 59.
And here I am struck with abundant matter for admiration. The announce
ment of " the play of Hamlet with the part of Hamlet omitted" could scarcely
awaken an odder train of ideas, than the grave intimation, that you feel " under
no obligation to account for the state of mind which Swedenborg had," and that
it would be " turning aside from your present object to attempt to give a definite
reply to the inquiries
" that might be started on this head To these various in
quiries which yousay " naturally present themselves for consideration," I will ven
ture to suggest that still another may be added, viz. what object you could have
had in writing, if it were one which would allow you to waive the settlement of
the very question which lies at the foundation of the whole subject. I must in
deed confess to no very familiar acquaintance with the etiquette of controversial
debate, but I had, in my simplicity, supposed that when a supernatural revela
tion was expressly claimed, and this revelation was held to be marked by certain
phenomena which could only be accounted for by supposing its truth, it fairly
devolved on the dissentient to show, either that the asserted phenomena did
not exist, or, if they did, that they could be adequately explained on some other
hypothesis than that of the truth of the revelation. It had never occurred to
me that a mere random guess at a solution —a purely perchance hypothesis —
the assignment of a cause equally apocryphal with that rejected—could be seri
ously proposed by one who was dealing in earnest with argument, and address
ing himself to men who could hardly be supposed incapable of seeing at once
and feeling very painfully the evasion.
Let me endeavor to present the matter in its true light and bearings. Here are
certain facts or phenomena, in the form of Memorable Relations of things heard and
seen in Heaven and Hell. How are these facts and phenomena to be accounted
for i The Seer himself accounts for them by ascribing them to a supernatural

origin, and his followers, if you so please to term them, are satisfied, judging
from their intrinsic nature, that this is the true and the only solution. You do
not deny the fact of the Relations having been given, or that they are, in many
respects, very remarkable, but you think differently as to their source. You
suggest that they may have proceeded from quite another state than that assumed
—that that state may have been a state of Mesmerism, or one similar to it—that it
may have been a state of insanity —or, finally, it may have been a state of dreaming.
Now what is more obvious than that you are bound, in fairness, to show that
one or all of these hypothecated states is capable of originating the phenomena
in question ? If not, to what purpose are they adduced ' But have you at
tempted in the least to show this? Have you made the slightest approach
towards a clear expose of the laws of mental action under the influence of either
of these causes ? Have you even intimated your own personal belief in the re
ality of those phenomena which are usually termed Mesmeric ? And can this be
considered fair dealing with your readers—not only to assign causes which yon
do not profess to demonstrate as sufficient to produce the effects, but some of
which you do not even profess to believe to be real ? I am aware, indeed, that
you have something to say of the tendency of fixed habits of thought and a pro
pensity to theorizing to convert ideal conceptions into living entities, but I still
insist that you have not, in the present case, laid open the matter in that full and
formal manner which the peculiar character of the facts required. If previous
opinion is prone to run into visions, the objects seen in the visions may ordina
rily be expected to agree with the opinions. In this instance, they do in multi
tudes of particulars, contradict previous impressions as might easily be shown.
The causes assigned, therefore, are not at all adequate to the effects. Indeed,
you will excuse me if I say, that your reasoning in the premises reminds me of
nothing more forcibly than of the logic of the wondering multitude on the day
of Pentecost. " And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying, What
meaneth this ? Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine." Here
was one inexplicable fact sagely attempted to be accounted for by another
equally inexplicable ; for who had ever dreamed that the most abundant potations
of new wine could impart the gift of new tongues ?
But you will perhaps refer me to the sequel of the paragraph for your reply.
You there say, " My purpose is to proceed according to the direction of the
ablest advocates of Swedenborg, and to look directly at the nature of his com
munications. If they appear to possess an intrinsic excellence, and to be consist

purpose, then, is to appeal to the nature of the communications, and to judge of
ihem by their intrinsic excellence. The phraseology I think peculiarly unhappy
and calculated to throw somewhat of a cloud over the real point at issue. The
question concerns not so much the intrinsic excellence of the subject-matter
of the Memorabilia, as its intrinsic truth. What is true may indeed be admitted
to be excellent, but the term suggests rather the moral quality of the subject
than its logical verity, and when matters of fact are in question the verdict is to
be rendered upon their truth or falsity, and not upon their excellence or vileness.

your meaning as virtually explained by what follows —viz. as that which is
" consistent with our settled views of the word and works of God," for doubtless
that of which this may be predicated is excellent, provided such settled views are
true views, which may perhaps be as much a matter of question as anything in
volved in the controversy. But of this I may say more hereafter.
Now in "looking directly at the nature of the communications" made in the
Memorable Relations —and this is the present theme of discussion —it is to be
borne in mind, that the things made known in them have relation mainly to the
state of spirits and angels—to the objects and scenery which surround them —and
to the modes of their intercourse with each other and with men on the earth.
These are the matters which come before us for consideration. The statements
respecting them are what we are called to pronounce judgment upon. Swe-
denborg affirms that these are things which he saw and heard in the other world
in consequence of a peculiar and supernatural translation of his spirit into that
world, which left his body comparatively unaffected. The ultimate question
to be decided is the question as to the fact of such a translation. The real object
of a searching inquiry into the nature of the communications is, to learn whether
they are such as to warrant the inference that they are to be ascribed to such a
source and to that only. If he was indeed actually illuminated by a supernatural
divine influence, I presume I am at liberty to suppose, that you would feel bound
to accept his utterances as being virtually the voice of God himself and clothed
with all the authority that you regard as necessarily pertaining to a revelation from
heaven. At present, however, you are not satisfied on this head, and therefore
feel constrained to submit the nature of his disclosures to a very close examina
tion.
In doing this an obvious question arises as to the lest by which their truth and
reliability is to be tried. If you insist upon the literal record of the Scriptures
being made the standard, then it is to be determined how far, in this direction, the
informations of the Scriptures extend—what measure of actual revelation, on this
head, they profess to give. We may safely assume, I think, that so far as his dis
closures run parallel with those of the Bible, they must be consistent with them,
when the latter are rightly understood, in order to be entitled to belief, and that
they are so, I do not at all hesitate to affirm. Whether, however, they shall in
all points agree with what you would term the ordinary " settled views" of the
mass of Christians, is another question, on which you and I might differ. But
this creates a new issue—viz. what is the genuine teaching of Scripture. And
on this point I cannot consent that the prevalent opinions of the Church shall be
made the criterion of the truth or falsehood of his disclosures. Take, for instance,
the tenet of the resurrection. Swedenborg assures us that the only resurrection
which is ever to take place, takes place at death, and is merely resuscitation into
the new life of the spirit-world. The mass of the Christian church believes the
true doctrine to be that of the resurrection of the buried body, in some sense or
other, at some far distant period of time. Here then is a direct conflict of views,
and issue is to be joined on the manner in which the inspired declarations are
properly to be interpreted. My own conviction and that of multitudes of others
who are not governed by Swedenborg's construction, is firm and unwavering
that the scriptures, rightly understood, do not sanction the common theory. I do
not see, therefore, that you can justly pronounce against the nature of the disclo

sures on this point, because the true question is a question of interpretation. But,
passing this, the fact is unquestionable that the amount of precise scriptural infor
mation in respect to the state beyond death is extremely small. The extent,
therefore, to which the two classes of disclosures can be compared, and one
made the test of the truth of the other, is proportionably limited. But 1 repeat
the admission made above, that as far as they do ran parallel, Swedenborg must
be consistent with the true sense of the Bible in order to be credible.
But we are forced upon another supposition. Suppose that Swedenborg goes,
in his revelations, beyond the point to which the inspired oracles conduct us, and
professedly gives forth an immense mass of information concerning the future
life, which we have no means of submitting to an explicit Scriptural test, in
what light is his claim then to be viewed ? You must, I think, either decide that
the alleged discoveries are false of course and not to be entertained at all, or that
they also are to be tried on the ground above indicated —viz. their intrinsic nature,
as consistent or inconsistent, not with the " settled views of the word of God,"
which is excluded by the supposition, but with the dictates and deductions of
right reason —reason, however, instructed by the general tenor of revelation. If
you take the former position, then it will devolve upon you to show that every
such claim is precluded in the nature of the case as involving an impossibility
per se, or by some express declaration of Jehovah himself forbidding the an
ticipation of any new light from any source whatever relative to the eternal
future before us. I am so little able to perceive any plausible ground for this
assumption, that I shall venture to take it for granted that you do not plant your
self upon it. The tribunal before which you would cite the Relations is that of
Reason, enlightened by Revelation, and to this tribunal I will accompany them,
after having adverted to your preliminary remarks.
" I will however turn your thoughts to a few suggestions in regard to the gen
eral subject before us. We will then take the position, that Swedenborg was
not divinely inspired. Now whether he had dreams, either asleep or awake,
or was in a Mesmeric state, or was the subject of an extraordinary kind of in
sanity ; it was perfectly natural that the actings of his mind should be according
to his settled character and habits. As he had a powerful intellect and a vivid
imagination, it was a matter of course, that the operations of his mind, whether
dreaming, or Mesmerized, or insane, would be vivid and powerful. And as he
had previously formed a habit of meditating and theorizing upon moral and re
ligious subjects, upon the things of earth and heaven and hell ; then, whether he
was under the influence of dreaming, or Mesmerism, or mono-mania, it was
very natural that his mind should dwell on these same subjects, and that these
subjects and his theories upon them should not only be revolved in his excited
imagination, but should be presented before him with extraordinary vividness,
and in such forms as he never conceived before. The general theories or prin
ciples were, we may suppose, already fixed in his mind ; and in his visionary
state they received their particular form and costume. In each of the states
above-mentioned, the imagination possesses a wonderfully creative power, and
even the intellect is endued with unwonted energy. If then a mind, endued
with such strength and fecundity as that of Swedenborg, and furnished with
such habits of thinking and philosophizing, is found, in either of the states sup
posed, to be the subject of operations singularly various and lively, and some
times, delightful and sublime; we have no occasion to be stumbled or surpris

would have been more to the purpose had you said, " We will take the position
that Swedenborg was not divinely illuminated." This position you are certainly
at liberty to take, provided you can find some satisfactory mode of accounting
for those phenomena of his case which we confidently believe can never be
solved on any other hypothesis than that of the alleged illumination. In pro
pounding your own solution, however, you are, as I conceive, fairly bound to
make it appear, at least to yourself, that the cause assigned is equal to the pro
duction of the effect, and moreover that it shall be a real and not a supposititious
or hypothetical cause, as such a character completely enervates all its argument
ative efficacy. Bringing then your proposed solution to this ordeal, what
shall be said of it ? First conceding that Swedenborg possessed " a powerful in
tellect and a vivid imagination" and then assuming that his mind was somehow
brought into an abnormal state, either by dreaming, Mesmerism, or insanity, you
remark that it is perfectly natural that its actings, in that state, should be accord
ing to his settled character and habits—that having previously formed a habit of
meditating and theorizing on moral and religious subjects, upon the things of
heaven and hell, he would of course dwell, in his abnormal and excited state,
upon these same subjects, and they, and his theories upon them, would be pre
sented before him with extraordinary vividness, and in such forms as he never
before conceived. Now, while I do not refuse to admit, in the abstract, the
soundness of the general principle, yet I am compelled to say, that the reasoning
in the present instance is vitiated by a radical defect in the very ground-work,
and that is the entire lack of evidence in regard to the main assumption. The
hypothesis of such a previous habit of meditating and theorizing on the phenom
ena of the other life, to the degree which would warrant your explanation, is
purely gratuitous. As Swedenborg was an eminently pious and devout man,
we may indeed suppose that his thoughts, like those of every other man of the
same character, were very conversant with the themes of the spiritual world,
and being also of a philosophical genius, we may well suppose that his mind
was no stranger to meditations on the philosophy of man's future existence. But
all this may be said of hundreds of other good men, and I should feel that I run
very little risk in affirming the same thing of yourself. I should by no means
think it strange, could the truth be known, that you had pondered as deeply and
speculated as much on the destiny of the soul, as Swedenborg had, prior to
what he terms his illumination. But if you should suddenly lay claim to super
natural revelations, I should not deem myself warranted in saying that the fact
could be sufficiently accounted for by a simple reference to your former habits
of religious meditation ; for in that case I could not see why multitudes of other
men in the community should not, for the same reason, rise up and assert the
same claims. In a word, the suggested cause would not appear to me adequate
to account for the effect. So also in regard to Swedenborg. I contend that you
have no sufficient grounds for supposing the existence of such a previous in
tellectual and moral state as that upon which you would build your solution of
the facts in his case.
" The general theories or principles were, we may suppose,
already fixed in his mind, and in his visionary state they received their particular
form and costume." But what authority have you for making this supposition ?

ed energy," so long as you have no evidence that the state described was his ?
You have clearly postulated your solution of the case upon conditions arbitrarily
assumed, and have reasoned as though the postulates were axioms. This may do
in science, but it is a very equivocal procedure in regard to moral subjects.
I shall venture, then, to affirm that you have not as yet succeeded in setting
aside the evidence, drawn from facts, of Svvedenborg's illumination, because the
mode in which you account for these facts rests upon a merely conjectural basis
of which not the slightest proof is adduced. His biography is open to you, and
if you find in that a warrant for your assumptions, let it be produced. I have
not found
it.
StillI do not deny but that other modes of solution remain which
may be argumentatively available, and these
I
shall consider when they come
up. All that
I
at present assert is, that you have offered an explanation of a
mental phenomenon, which rests solely on
a
gratuitous assumption, and which
is
therefore of no value.
But supposing yourself in possession of the true key to the marvel, you go on
to apply the theory to the Relation concerning the state of infants in the other
life. Proceeding on the presumption that this had been
a
theme of much pre
vious reflection, your fancy can easily shadow forth his, and you have no diffi
culty in seeing how his dreaming, or Mesmerised, or insane imagination could
•have dressed up the ruling idea that had taken possession of his mind in the
forms presented in his writings. Without here adverting to the lack of all tes
timony to the fact of such former profound study upon this particular point,
it
will be seen upon reference to his Relations that they involve numerous items
of statement intimately connected with his entire system of the future life, and
which are as remote as possible from the ideas that would naturally enter in
to
a
mere dreaming representation of the heaven of infants. Thus, for instance,
he says their first speech
is
merely a sound of affection, which by degrees be-
comes more distinct, as the ideas of thought enter
;
for the ideas of thought from
the affections constitute all angelic speech. This refers us not only to what he
says elsewhere of vocal sound among spirits, but also to his profound philoso
phy in regard to the relation between affection and thought. Again he says that
some infants are of the disposition of the spiritual, and some of the celestial an
gels
;
hinting herein at
a
distinction of the angelic orders which
is
expanded
elsewhere at great length and set forth as pre-eminently important. He remarks,
moreover, that in the Grand Man of heaven all infants are in the province of the
eyes, those in the province of the left eye, who are of a spiritual disposition,
and those in the province of the right eye, who are of a celestial disposition,
I
am not here discussing the question of the truth of these representations, as
whether heaven is, in any sense, arranged into the human form, which
is
it
self a very strange dream
if
it
is
merely a dream
;
but my object
is
to show that
what he asserts of the state of infants in the other world,
is
simply a part of a
stupendous scheme of spiritual existence which
is
throughout so perfectly ad
justed and harmonized in all its parts, and embodying so sublime
a
conception,
that whenever properly apprehended, the idea of its being the product of a mere
dreaming, excited, or insane imagination,
is
no less extravagant than would be
that of the Pyramids of Egypt having been built by myriads of men in
a
state
of somnambulism.

" Suppose a man accustomed to profound thinking, and to moral and philo
sophical speculation, like Swedenborg. Looking at the mixed characters of
men in the present life, he finds it difficult to see how they can be at once re
ceived either into heaven, or hell ; and he begins to think there may be an inter
mediate state, where those who die, will undergo a farther process of discipline,
which will more completely develope and fix their character, and thus fit them-
forthe world of happiness, or of wo. This idea may at length become settled in
his mind, not perhaps as an article of faith, but as an opinion, which appears
suited to remove his difficulties, and to satisfy his feelings. Now let the subject
be carried into his dreams, or into some of the more active states of mono
mania; and his opinion, or speculation will become a living reality, and he will
see dead men in the other world very much in the condition in which he had
seen them here—engaging in conversation and controversy, pursuing various
occupations, and passing through various scenes of trial, and all, of course,
more humano. So long as he continues in this state, all the objects of his thoughts
will stand before his mind as realities and certainties. And it will be nothing
strange, if he should imagine, that these creations of his excited mind are all
from God, and ought to be received as divine revelations." —p. 63.
This you regard as an adequate view of the process by which a man " accus
tomed to profound thinking and to moral and philosophical speculation," may
have been led from the entertainment of an opinion to the ideal creation of a
world of corresponding phantasms, and to the belief of a consequent divine
mission. Such is the genesis, in your judgment, of the hallucination of an intel
lect gifted by nature and by culture far beyond the standard of ordinary minds. '
You do not indeed say, in express terms, that you regard the dominant idea
which has thus passed, in his mind, into definite form and feature, as erroneous,
but this is evidently implied, for if you deemed it accordant with reason or rev
elation you would scarce feel under the necessity of accounting for it from the
play of an active fancy ministering to the workings of a morbid speculation.-
The only question, in that case, would be as to the probability of his having
seen the truth by any other than the ordinary intellectual eye — the same eye by
which you profess to see it not to be the truth. Now you will allow me to sug
gest, first, that, as already remarked, you have no positive evidence whatever,
that the current of his prior speculations ran peculiarly in this channel ; and,
secondly, that in stating the facts as he does on this head, lie professes to give
the most rational and philosophical reasons for the existence of such an inter
mediate state of souls as he describes, referring it to the very nature and consti
tution of man, and the necessary operation of the laws by which he is governed
as a being of affection and intellect; and moreover that the force of these reasons
must be in some way neutralized before the asserted fact can be fairly enrolled
in the category of mental delusions. The reasons adduced have been found ad
equate, by multitudes of intelligent minds, to command their full conviction, so
that if they are fallacious there is more of a problem to be accounted for than
Swedenborg's own hallucination. How happens it that his reveries or ravings
carry with them such a power of rational evidence as to infect the sanest and
soberest minds with the most confident persuasion of their truth ?
But the main point on which I take exceptions to your remarks on this head
is, that you have assumed the leading idea respecting an intermediate state to
be false, and on this assumption have endeavored to account for the fact of his
affirming it. Now if the thing asserted be intrinsically true, that truth may
account for the assertion and supersede the necessity of any other mode of ex
plaining it. The only question to be determined, is as to the fact of the superna

turd seeing. This would probably create little difficulty to your mind, provided
only the things seen were intrinsically true ; and this is the ground which I ven
ture to take. I maintain the fact of an intermediate state, and found the position
upon the nature of man, as absolutely requiring it. It is not, however, de
manded of me to argue the point, since, as you take its falsity for granted, you
have brought no arguments against it to which I can reply. Whenever yon see
fit to do this, I will pledge myself to meet you in the open field of debate. If
you hold that the nature of man is not the true criterion, but that every question
of this kind is to be decided by the testimony of the Word of God, I shall not
shrink from an endeavor to show the contrary, viz. that there are multitudes of
truths relating to our being and destiny which are determinable on their own
evidence, and which compel assent as imperiously as anything in the letter of
Scripture, although it is, at the same time impossible that they should, when set
tled, be in conflict with the true sense of Scripture, as this would be to set one
class of truths at war with another, which, of course, can never be. And I
must here be permitted to say, that I know of no principle more disastrous to
the interests of the Christian faith, than that the express letter of revelation is to
be made the standard of all attainable knowledge in the various departments of
science, physical and psychological. The results reached in those sciences will
inevitably trench, in some part or other, upon the announcements of holy writ,
just as Geology, for instance, has come in contact, not to say collision, with the
literal record, and the established construction, of Genesis. These results it is
utterly impossible, on good grounds, to gainsay. The Author of our nature has
so formed the human mind that it cannot resist the strength of the evidence when
it is fairly arrayed before
it,
and
if
this evidence
is
of such
a
character that the
ordinary interpretation of the letter of the Scriptures cannot stand before it, that
interpretation will give way, as
it
assuredly ought. But what then
?
Is the es
sential truth of the Word thereby endangered
?
Not in the least. The intended
Truth will stand forth eliminated from all factitious appendages and be seen to be
of such
a
nature as to be entirely consistent with every sound development in
whatever sphere of research and discovery. And as
it
is
with physical science,
'
so will
it
be with psychological. The attempt
is
utterly vain to repress the spirit
of inquiry which
is
pushing inwards, outwards, upwards, and downwards, intent
upon exploring the depths of all being, and especially of solving the problem of
man's compound nature, and through the medium of the body of reaching the
mystery of the soul. By the issues of these investigations, carefully and scien
tifically conducted, the mind will infallibly abide. If
it
finds intrinsic truth
in Swedenborg's disclosures,
it
will receive
it
and rest in it, whether, for the
present,
it
can harmonize
it
with the verbal declarations of Scripture or not.
The pious zeal which would fain stay this process, from ostensible reverence
for the Bible, builds itself upon
a
fundamental fallacy, to wit, that we can be
more certain of having compassed the true sense of revelation than we can be
of the soundness of our conclusions, drawn from scientific premises. The delu
sion will doubtless be eventually dispelled, but only in consequence of a long and
arduous struggle, and from a clear conviction of the vantage-ground given by
it
to
the infidel in his warfare against the Word.
It
is
not impossible that all this may
strike you as little less than infidelity itself, but
I
have weighed my words and

94 REPLY TO DR. WOODS.
The specimens which you are pleased to give of the " visions" of Sweden-
borg you preface with the remark, that they have " manifestly the quality, the
texture, and the dress of what often occurs in dreaming, or in the mental exer
cises of the insane." Upon this I would observe, in passing, that dreams ordi
narily occur in the state of sleep, and that if all Svvedenborg's visions took place
while he was asleep, the sleeping portion of his existence must have been enor
mously great, and as it would doubtless take as long to write them as to dream
them, it would seem that his whole life, for thirty years, must have been divid
ed between dreaming and writing out his dreams, for his works, which contain
them are exceedingly voluminous, and it is not easy to see what time he
could have had for anything else. Yet it is clear that he must, in some way,
have found time for extended study, as these works contain expositions of
thousands upon thousands of texts, which we cannot but suppose he consulted
in the pages of the Bible. How then could he have contrived to compress so
much labor into his waking hours ? This difficulty is enhanced by the fact that
his life was not strictly that of a recluse, but more or less that of a public man,
who was much in society, who entertained a great deal of company, and was
very frequent in journeys and voyages to and from his native country. The
only solution that I can think of is, that what you would term his dreaming
state must have been his ordinary state, and that he wrote down his visions
while he was in the very act of beholding them ; and this would seem to force
upon us the conclusion, that he was either insane, as you would probably infer,
or that he was truly the subject of true revelations. The latter supposition, if
admitted, will solve all the difficulties ; but if we adopt the former, it will be ob
viously a fair question, whether a man could remain for a long course of years
day and night in a state of monomania, fancying himself in converse with spir
its and angels, which were all the time the mere phantoms of his own brain, and
yet in his intercourse with the world, at home and abroad, and in a wide corres
pondence with his friends, betray no palpable symptoms of mental aberration.
Read his biography— read the Eulogy of Sandel—the testimony of Hartley,
Springer, Colin, and others who were honored with his acquaintance, and I will
venture to say that you will find nothing from either of these Sources, other than -
the claim itself to spiritual insight, to warrant the idea of anything in his speech or
demeanor indicative of insanity. Yet I ask whether it be in the range of prob
ability, that a mind like that of Swedenborg could pass, by a transition totally
unperceived by all around him, from the most perfect soundness to a confirmed
dementation? Would not the eclipse of such a luminary in the firmament of
science be widely noted, chronicled, and deplored ? That inuendos of a mind
diseased were here and there scattered abroad by certain of the Swedish clergy
who were opposed to his doctrines, does not vacate the evidence of the general
fact that he was uniformly regarded by all his most intimate friends —mainly
men of name and distinction in the realm —as a man of sane and sober mind,
although his addiction to abstruse speculations was well known.*

it maybe easily believed that he was not only a learned man and a gentleman after

T must then be allowed to think, that there is a problem here which deserves
far more attention than you have given it. The hypothesis proposed is encum
bered with real difficulties of fact which have been strangely overlooked, not by
yourself only, but by many others who have adopted your view of Swedenborg's
case. If his Relations are the product of insanity, we wish to know more about
the laws of insanity, and especially how far a man can be under its influence all
the time for thirty years, and yet succeed in hiding it from his most intimate
friends.
But you proceed to furnish your readers with a portion of the evidence that
Swedenborg's visions have manifestly the quality, texture, and dress of what of
ten occurs in dreaming and insanity. As a proof that these visions, upon close
inspection, resolve themselves into " such stutfas dreams are made of," you ad
duce one of the memorable Relations setting forth " the lot of those after death
who have confirmed themselves in faith alone unto justification," adding the re
mark, that this is " a point which he looked upon with the utmost dislike, and
which it was the object of many of his revelations to refute ;" as to which I
would observe, it would be more correct to say—" which it was the object of
many of his arguments to refute," for as to having himself any object in his reve
lations, such as might naturally be supposed to control their form or scope —any
conscious design or ability of his own to apply them to a particular purpose —
we do not by any means allow the supposition. Whatever object there was in
these revelations, it was the object of Him who granted them, and not of him
who received them. What should we think of the intimation, that Daniel or
John had a special object to accomplish by their revelations ? If you had said it
was the object of Swedenborg's revelations to expose the falsities of the tenet of
justification by faith alone, I should have no objection to the language, but that
would have been the Lord's object, and not his.
But to the vision itself. And here I am forced at the outset to confess to a pe
culiar difficulty in treating the matter from not knowing precisely the point of
view in which you object to this vision. I am obliged, therefore, to suppose
either,
(1.) That you deny the main position which the vision seems designed to es
tablish, or at least to imply, viz. the falsity of the doctrine of justification by faith
alone, and consequently that such is the lot, in the other life, of those who have
held the doctrine on earth. Or,
(2.) That whether Swedenborg's view of the doctrine be theologically true
or false, you still deem it incredible that the state described, can be such as he
represents it. Or,
(3.) That, conceding the truth to be intrinsically what he affirms, both as to the
doctrine and the state, you do not believe he was enabled to see it by a spirit
ual vision.
Upon one or the other of these bases I think your objections must rest. I will
common genius. How he was looked upon in foreign lands I do not know; but in
Stockholm, even those who could not read his writings were always pleased to meet
him in company, and paid respectful attention to whatever he said." —Robsam's Mc-
moire, Hobart't Life of Swcdenborg, p. 220.
" He spoke very deliberately, and it was a great pleasure to sit with him at table.
As soon as he began to speak all conversation ceased, and the slowness of his delivery
served to increase the curiosity of the listeners." —Id. p. 212.

REPLY TO DR. WOODS.
advert to them in order. As to the first, it is plain that it amounts to a purely
theological question, viz. what is the true Scripture doctrine of justification, and
this is a question to be decided upon its own merits independent of all visions,
whether of Swedenborg or any one else. You are required to meet him on this
ground simply as a theologian. But this you have declined to do. You have
not seen fit to advance the shadow of an argument in refutation of his teachings,
but have evidently assumed that they are false and heretical of course, because at
variance with the accredited doctrine of the creeds esteemed evangelical and
orthodox. This therefore leaves me nothing to say, unless I choose to launch
out into a broad discussion of the subject of justification, without any distinct
propositions to guide the course of argument; for I have long since learned that
there are no formulas of belief on any point among Protestant sects by the exact
phraseology of which, as written in their creeds, their advocates feel themselves
bound to abide. Every one puts his own construction upon them, and deems
himself called to defend only his own personal belief. I can only say, therefore,
that whenever you shall see fit to state your own views on the subject, or your
own definite objections to Swedenborg's views, I shall be happy to enter into the
discussion. It is a topicVhich the receivers of his system have no desire to evade.
As this, then, cannot justly be regarded as the ground of a valid objection
against the vision in debate, inasmuch as it is a pure question of theology to be
determined independent of all visions, I come to the second hypothesis, which
supposes that whether his view of justification be theologically true or false, yet
we have no sufficient reasons for believing that his Relations on this head de
scribe a veritable state of things among spirits in the other life. This doubtless
sets before us the true point at issue, and it will be well to look somewhat
minutely at the different items of the description as they are numbered and ar
ranged by Swedenborg himself.
" 1. When they are dead, and revive as to their spirit, which commonly hap
pens on the third day after the heart has ceased to beat, they appear to them
selves in a body like that which they had before in the world, so that they know
no otherwise than that they are living in the former world; yet they are not in
a material body, but in a spiritual body, this appearing to their senses, which
are also spiritual, as if it was material, although it is not so."— p. 64.
This is his uniform teaching as to the state of men immediately after death,
and I should be gratified to know in what respects, and for what reasons, you
conceive the fact to be otherwise. There is certainly something which survives
the body, aud goes into the spiritual world at death. This you call the man —the
essential person who is said to die—for you say expressly in your work that you
believe " the mind or spirit is essentially the man—that he continues to exist after
the death of the body, a real and true man, in the full possession of the power of
perceiving and knowing, of loving and hating, enjoying and suffering —and that
he has all his mental powers and faculties, as a rational and moral being, in a
higher degree of activity and perfection than before."— (p. 116.) If then the man
thus exists after death as " a real and trae man," he must exist as a substance, and
if so, in a form, for I will venture to say that you cannot conceive anything more
'impossible than that a substance can exist without a form.* I do not say that this

essence, is not anything ; for essence has no quality except from form, nor is form any

is instantaneously perceived, but I am confident the experiment will satisfy any
one of its truth. Nothing alone is without form. Now if a man passes into the
other world in a form, what shall we suppose that form to be ? Even if we allow
some contingency in the case, are not the chances for its being in the human
form as great as those for its being in any other ?* Is there not something too in
the fact, that we instinctively think of our departed friends and children as re
taining in, heaven the form which they wore on earth ? Is this a mere prejudice
resting on no adequate basis ? Is it not rather the effect of a general influx of
truth into the minds of men ? But let us essay to advance a little closer to the
core of the question. It is certain that the intellectual and voluntary principle
in man does not act upon the grosser organism of the body but through a me
dium, which may perhaps be most properly termed the psychical element, or that
principle which is the grand agent in sensation and which has peculiar relation
to the nervous economy. This principle lives in and pervades the entire crasser
structure of the body, and to this I think Swedenborg alludes under the denomi
nation " spirit," which in this connection is doubtless the spiritual body, in the
following passage ;
" As to what concerns the spirit of man, that also is created
from finite things. What is the spirit of man, but a receptacle of the life of the
mind ? The finite things from which that is, are the spiritual substances which
are in the spiritual world, and are also brought together in our earth, and therein
concealed." —(T. C. R. 470.) These spiritual or psychical substances pervading
the body are, according to him, so closely related to the inner and essential
man, that they go with him into the other world, forming the body which he
then inhabits, and of which Swedenborg thus speaks;
" Man rises again immediately after death, and then appears to himself in the
body altogether as in the world, with such a face, with such members, arms,
hands, feet, breast, belly, loins ; yea also when he sees himself and touches him
self, he says that he is a man in the world : nevertheless it is not his external,
which he carried about in the world, that he sees and touches, but it is the in
ternal, which cbnstitutes that very human which lives, and which had an exter
nal about itself or out of the single things of itself, whereby it could be in the
world, and act suitably there and perform its functions ; the earthly corporeal is
no longer of any use to it, it being in another world where are other functions,
and other powers and abilities, to which its body, such as it has there, is adapt
ed : this body it sees with its eyes, not those which it had in the world, but those
which it has there, which are the eyes of its internal man, and out of which
through the eyes of the body it had before seen worldly and terrestrial things :
it also feels it with the touch, not with the hands or sense of touch which it en
joyed in the world, but with the hands and sense of touch which it there enjoys,
which is that from which its sense of touch in the world existed : every sense
also is there more exquisite and more perfect, because it is the sense of the inter
nal of man set loose from the external, for the internal is in a more perfect state,
inasmuch as it gives to the external the power of sensation, but when it acts into
the external, as in the world, then the sensation is rendered dull and obscure ;
subsisting entity, except from essence ; consequenly, there is not any predication con
cerning either when separated from the other." —T. C. R. 367.
* " The soul is a human form, from which nothing at all can be taken away, and to
which nothing at all can be added ; and it is the inmost form of all the forms of the
body ; and because the forms which are without receive from the inmost both essence
and form, therefore you are, as you appear to yourselves and to us, souls. In a word
the soul is the man himself, because it is the inmost man ; wherefore its form is fully
and perfectly the human form ; nevertheless it is not life, but it is the proximate recep
tacle of life from God, and thus the habitation of God."— T. C. R. 697.

moreover it is the internal which is sensible of the internal, and the external
which is sensible of the external ; hence it is that men after death see each other,
and are in society together according to the interiors ; that I might be certain as
to these things, it has also been given me to touch spirits themselves, and to
speak frequently with them on this subject." —A. C. 5078.
Now this body, Swedenborg teaches, man takes with him into the other life
from the natural body. It was in it while he lived, and it is eliminated out of it
when he dies. You may indeed ask the evidence of all this, and I will ask the
evidence on which you believe anything contrary to it. I maintain that it is the
nearest approximation which the human mind can make to a rational conception
of the subject and agrees better with the ascertained facts of our psychological
nature. It is, on this ground, quite reasonable to suppose that the separation of
the psychical from the corporeal element should be somewhat slow and gradual,
and the space of three days may, as a general fact, be no less than the time requi
site for the complete dislodgment. The phenomena of suspended animation, in
cases of drowning, strangling, fcc. clearly prove that life is often by no means
wholly extinct, even when all outward signs of it have disappeared. Nor, if this
view be admitted, am I able to see why it should not be, to the emancipated spir

the most natural of all impressions, that
it
is
still in possession of
a
body.
It
has still a vehicle which serves
it

a
medium of action. Though
it

off an outer garment,
it

covering,
it
is
yet " clothed upon" of its finer and more ethereal. Why should
it
not be, to the spirit's consciousness, as
if
it
still abode in its earthly tabernacle
?
What else, at first, can
it
think
?
How else can
it
feel
?
Where then lies the
valid objection against the first item of the description
?
I proceed to the sec

the societies arranged ac

The intimation of social arrangements in the world of spirits contains in
it,
I
think, nothing abhorrent to our best ideas of the state of things awaiting a being
like man, nor
is
it
at all inconsistent with what you have professed as your own
belief. " We have believed that the spirits of men in another world, even be

that far more perfectly than was ever done by means of bodily organs in the pres

to the violence of the supposition that the simple act of dying should effect a
miraculous separation of the elements of moral character, while yet all mustevent-
uatty be fixed in a state of happiness or misery, I imagine you will come to the
conclusion that this point is intrinsically no more staggering than either of the
others.
" 3. The novitiate spirit —is introduced into various societies, both good and
evil, and examination is made whether he is affected by truths, and in what
manner ; and whether, and in what manner, he is affected by falses."*—p. 65.
This is merely the first step of the process by which every one is gradually
arranged into his appropriate society. This is done by applying a moral touch
stone to the character.
" 4. If he is affected by truths, he is withdrawn from evil societies, and intro
duced into good societies, and also into various ones, until he comes into a so
ciety corresponding with his own natural affection, where he enjoys the good
corresponding with that affection ; and this until he has put off his natural affec
tion and has put on a spiritual affection, and then he is elevated into heaven ;
but this takes place with those who in the world have lived a life of charity."t —
p. 65.
This completes the process. His association is according to his predominant
spiritual sympathies. No force is put forth to control his destiny. Everything
is so ordered as tp preserve his liberty of choice intact, and he gravitates freely
to his proper centre. Is there anything in this at which the reason of a saint
can revolt ?
" 5. But they who have confirmed themselves in doctrine and life in faith,
alone unto justification, by reason of their not being affected by truths, but by
falses, and because they have rejected the goods of charity —are withdrawn from
good societies, and introduced into evil societies, and also into various ones, un
til they come into the society which corresponds to the concupiscences of their
love."t—p. 65.
The only question here to be raised is as to the fact of confirmation in doc
trine and life in faith alone necessarily supposing a rejection of the goods of
charity and a rooting of the affection of falses instead of truths. If such is the
real internal character accompanying this belief, then it is easy to see that the
* I find upon recurrence to the volume from which this is taken that a clause is omitted
for which I am unable to account. It there reads thus ;—" The novitiate spirit, or the
spiritual man, is conducted, &c." So slight an addition could not materially have pro
longed the extract, and thus encumbered the page, so that I am forced to ask whether
there were not some design in the suppression not exactly worthy of a fair spirit of
controversy.
+ Here again I find a clause suppressed which I am compelled to say has a suspicious
air. The whole sentence in the A. R. reads thus;—"But this takes place with those
who in the world have lived a life of charity, and thus alio a life of faith, which consists
in believing in the Lord, and shunning evils as sins." Now if the addition of this clause
does not affect the tenor of the whole paragraph, I can see no reason for not insertingit.
If it does, a very serious question arises as to the motives of the omission. I confess it
has vastly the appearance, of a desire to keep out of view Swedenborg's asserted con
nection between faith and charity, that is, faith and life.
t Again another unaccountable suppression. Why could we not have had the sen
tence complete ;—" And because they have rejected the goods of charity, which are good
works, from the means of salvation, are withdrawn, &c." So also at the close of the ex
tract —
"for he who loves falses, cannot but love evils." Considering the brevity of these
clauses the inference seems inevitable, that they convey a shade of meaning which

withdrawment from good societies and the introduction to evil, follows as a mat
ter of course. But Swedenborg shows that it is the very essence of this doctrine,
in its practical working, to found the hope of acceptance and salvation, not upon
an inward subjective principle of good, but upon an outward objective righteous
ness wrought by Christ, received by faith, and accounted to the believer by im
putation. This view of the nature of justification he says does not necessarily
militate with a man's remaining in his dominant worldly love, and consequently
must leave him, in the other life, liable to " come into that society which corres
ponds to the concupiscences of his love." AU this you may deny as a matter of
theology, but you cannot deny it as a vision, unless you first show it to be dog
matically false. How much of truth and sound reasoning you may see in what
follows, I know not; but I think it will be much easier to dissent from it than to
disprove it.
" From what has been adduced let it be well considered, whether to have faith
be anything else than to live according to it ; and whether to live according to
it,
be not only to know and to think, but also to will and to do
;
for faith
is
not in
man whilst
it
is
only in his knowledge and thought, but when
it
is
also in his
will and in his actions. Faith in man
is
faith of the life, but faith not yet in man
is
faith of the memory and of the thought thence derived. By faith of the life
is
understood believing in God, but to believe those things which are from God,
and not to believe in God,
is
mere historical faith, which
is
not saving. Who
that
is
a
true priest and good pastor, does not desire that men may live well
i
and who does not know that the faith of knowledges, obtained from hearsay,
is
not the faith of the life, but historical faith
?
Faith of the life
is
the faith of
charity, for charity
is
life. But although the case
is
thus clear, yet
I
foresee,
that they who have confirmed themselves in the doctrine of faith alone and jus
tification thereby, will not recede from
it
by reason of their connecting falsities
with truths
;
for they teach truths when they teach from the Word, but they
teach falsities when they teach from doctrine
;
and hence they confound those
things, by saying, that the fruits of faith are the good of life, and that these
follow from faith, and yet that the goods of life contribute nothing to salvation,
but faith alone. Thus do they conjoin and separate
;
and when they conjoin
they teach truths, but only before the people, who do not know that they so
invert, and say these things from necessity, in order that their doctrine may
cohere with the Word
;
but when they separate, they teach falsities, for they say
that faith saves, and not the goods of charity which are works, in this case not
knowing that charity and faith act as one, and that charity consists in acting well
and faith in believing well, and that to believe well without acting well
is
im
possible
;
thus that there can be no faith without charity, and that charity
is
the
esse of faith and its soul, hence that faith alone
is
faith without a soul, and thus
a
dead faith
;
and inasmuch as such faith
is
not faith, hence justification thereby
is
a
mere non-entity." —A. E. 250.

REPLY TO DR. WOODS. 101
What is here affirmed follows naturally, and I may say necessarily, from what
precedes as to the internal state of those who are simply in faith without being
at the same time in charity. What is said of their exercising temporary dominion
flows from the general principle elsewhere asserted and largely dwelt upon,
that a man's ruling love follows him to the other life, and that it then comes into
corresponding manifestations, just as the tenant in the madhouse holds on in
the dream of royalty, when his kingdom is commensurate with the walls of his
cell, and he wields a straw for his sceptre.
" 7. After frequent dismissals, —they are next led away into a desert, where
there are cottages, into which they enter, and work of some kind is given them
—and as they do
it,
they receive food, and
if
they do not do
it,
they are hungry
—so that at length necessity compels them. Food there
is
similar to the
food in this world, but
it
is
from
a
spiritual origin, and
is
given from heaven—
to all according to the uses they perform; to the idle nothing
is
given, because
they are useless."—
p.
66.
" 8. After a time they loathe work, and then they go out of the cottages
;
and
if
they have been priests, they have an inclination to build
;
and there appear
then immediately heaps of hewn stones, bricks, rafters, and boards, also heaps
of reeds and bulrushes, clay, lime, and bitumen, which, when they see, the lust
of building
is
kindled, and they begin to construct a house, taking now a stone,
and then wood, now a reed, and then clay, and placing them irregularly, one
upon another, but in order as
it
seems to themselves; but what they build by
day falls down by night
;
and the next day they gather materials from among the
rubbish, and build again, and this they continue to do, until they are tired of
building. From this cause
it
is, they collect together falses to confirm salvation
by faith alone
,
and such falses cannot serve to build up a church hi any other
manner." —
p.
66.
The fundamental doctrine of correspondences
is
essential to the right under
standing of what
is
here said of the occupation of the spirits described in the
other life. From the very fact that they are spirits in
a
spiritual world, the ob
jects and the scenery around must be of the same nature. But these visual
sceneries will be necessarily in accordance with the dominant states of life grow
ing out of the affections, thoughts, interests, and pursuits, which went to form
those states while they lived on earth.
If
they were then in reality busied in build
ing up a fallacious system of doctrine, as that of faith alone undoubtedly is, no
thing could more strikingly represent the internal prompting by which they
were actuated than the spiritual correspondence here set before us. They con
tinue to do in the other world what they mainly did in this, allowing for the ne
cessary difference of condition in a natural and a spiritual sphere of existence.
And how,
I
ask, could the pertinency of Paul's illustration be more forcibly dis
played than by the very scenery here depicted
?
"If any man build upon this
foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man's work
shall be made manifest." Here certainly are very similar materials employed in
a very similar kind of building, and what
is
there irrational or absurd in suppos
ing that by the laws of mental action in the other world —and this
is
the only ac
tion that can there have place —the very representative phenomena here set forth
know what truth and justice are in themselves, therefore, &c." " But only to be as quickly
and rapidly dismissed." Similar omissions occur in the remaining extracts, and
though they are in all cases indicated by a dash, they would scarcely be suspected by
the ordinary reader. Still
I
do not regard them, for the most part, as materially affect
ing the sense of the context, nor do
I
feel at liberty to consider them as beyond the reach
of a satisfactory explanation.
I
only speak of them as singular.

shall occur ? I of course admit that the fact of the alleged phenomena in regard
to the particular class of spirits alluded to, depends upon the truth of the teach
ings respecting the doctrine in question, and this is to be judged of entirely inde
pendent of all visionary representation. You cannot justly feel yourself at liberty
to impugn the tenet on the ground of the vision, nor do I see that you can deny
that if the tenet is true, the vision may be real. At any rate, this is to be deter
mined by the soundness or sophistry of the radical principles on which this
whole matter of representative scenery in the other life rests. In the determi
nation ofthis question the deepest laws of our psychological being are involved.
We have to meet face to face the problem of spiritual perception. Do spirits be
hold objects in the spiritual world ? Ifso, what are they ? Material things are ex
cluded in the very nature of the case. Can you conceive that those objects shall
be any other than spiritual, and if so, must they not be mental creations ? But
will not mental creations be shaped and moulded by the interior states of the
minds from which they flow ? And is not this correspondence ?* And is not the law
of correspondence the central theme of Swedenborg's disclosures ? How then can
it be imagined for a moment, that a system developing this magnificent law is
to be turned from with a smile of mingled pity and contempt as the dream of a
mystic ? What approach to justice is to be recognized in the attempt to deal
with the visions, while no regard is had to the philosophical basis on which
they are built ?
And may I now be permitted to ask whether your exhibition of this particular
feature of the Relations can justly be deemed a valid impeachment of its cred
ibility ? You have avowed the purpose of looking directly at the nature of the
alleged communications. Do you find anything in the nature of the present
which is inconsistent with the fundamental law of the whole, and do you find
anything in that law inconsistent with the deductions of reason or the inform
ations of holy writ ?
The remarks which I have ventured to offer on the vision now considered ap
ply, in their general scope, to all the rest. In presenting these visions to your
readers you have avoided the least reference to the laws of psychology on which
they are professedly founded. Your exhibit of the details is, therefore, at once
partial and distorted. The reader is furnished with no clew to guide him to the
fundamental law—with no hints that can operate to prevent his regarding them
as the height of absurdity and madness. And so far as the relations are intend
ed to set forth the falsities of certain doctrines generally received in the Chris
tian church, whether that of the Trinity, Justification, Atonement, or Regen
eration, you do not condescend to argue these points on their own merits, but
taking for granted the truth of the prevalent constructions, you hold up the vi
sions in an odious light, because their scope seems to contravene the purport of
* This is strikingly illustrated in the explanation of Ex. xxii. 1, "If in digging a thief be
caught," &c which signifies, he says, in the internal sense, the taking away of good and
truth. That digging through a house denotes to take away the good of another in secret,
derives its origin from representations in another life. In that life, when the angels are
discoursing concerning the false destroying the good in secret, it is represented below,
where the. angelic discourse is exhibited to the sight, by the digging through a wall, and
on the other hand, when the angelic discourse is concerning truth acceding to good con
joining itself to it, it is represented by an open door, through which there is entrance."
—A. C. 9126. This throws additional light upon what we have previously said of the
philosophy of the spiritual sense.

the popular creeds ; whereas if the doctrinal positions are sound, the visions
assume at once an entirely new phasis. They can then be met only on the
third ground above assumed, viz. that the fact of their being enjoyed at all is
intrinsically incredible —a point which now comes to be considered, as the se
cond has been already replied to in what I have said above.
The paramount claim asserted in behalf of Swedenborg is that of the opening
of his spiritual senses, in consequence of which he was favored with the privi
lege of converse with the spiritual world, and made supernaturally cognizant of
its facts, phenomena, and laws. The credibility of such a state must first be
tried by the test of its possibility. On this point, however, I cannot deem it need
ful to enlarge, as I do not know that a question has ever been raised upon it.
It is, I believe, by universal consent admitted, that such a translation of the
spirit as Swedenborg alleges of himself is intrinsically possible. At any rate, it
cannot well be denied by those who concede the truth of the prophetic ecstasy,
or the occasional rapture of the souls of holy men whose earthly experience,
particularly upon the death-beds, has antedated celestial joys. Is there any
thing, for instance, in the statement that follows to which a believer in the Bible
oan reasonably object as intrinsically incredible or absurd ?
" When man is in this state ( in the spirit), the things which exist in the spiritual
world appear to him as clearly as the objects in the natural world ; but the ob
jects then seen by him, because they are from a spiritual origin, are in them
selves spiritual, and such things as are of celestial wisdom are presented to him
as it were in natural images. Thus divine things are presented in visible forms
before the eyes of spirits and angels ; hence it is that all things which are seen
in heaven, are representatives and significatives, as were also the things seen by
John, which are treated of in the Apocalypse. Whilst man is in the body he
does not see the things that are in heaven, unless the sight of his spirit is opened
but when this sight is opened, he sees them ; thus John saw the things which
are described in the Apocalypse, and in like manner also the prophets saw, who
are therefore called Seers, and are said to have had their eyes opened ; thus also
angels were seen in ancient times, and thus also the Lord was seen by the dis
ciples after his resurrection. This sight is the sight of the spiritual man; and
because in such case all things seen appear representatively, therefore it was
opened in John. He who does not know anything of this sight, believes that
angels, when they were seen by men, assumed a human form, and that when
they vanished out of sight, they laid it aside ; this, however, was not the case,
but angels then appeared in their own form, which is the human form, not be
fore the sight of the bodily eyes, but before the sight of the spirit, which sight
was then opened : this is evident from the Lord being seen by the disciples after
his resurrection, when he himself showed them that he was a man in a perfect
human form ; and nevertheless he became invisible ; for when they saw him,
the eyes of their spirits were opened, but when he became invisible they were
closed. That man has such a sight, is manifest to me from much experience,
for all the things which I have seen in the heavens were seen by that sight, and
on those occasions I was in a like state of wakefulness as when they were not
seen ; but that sight is seldom opened to any one by the Lord at this day, and
that for many reasons." —A. E. 53.
This certainly shows the fact of the possibility of such a state as Swedenborg
asserts of himself, and this fact I regard as of immense importance in reference to
his claim. I cannot but think a great advance is made towards establishing that
claim when the conviction is firmly seated in the mind, that his assumption on
this score may possibly have been true. It is gratifying to be able to hold this posi
tion unchallenged, that what is intrinsically possible in any case may have been

true in his case. This, however, is a question of evidence. The probability of
the truth of his claim has to be pronounced upon, and the judgment formed will
inevitably be governed by an intelligent estimate of the reasons which may be
urged in its support, and of the kind of testimony by which it shall be sustained.
On the first head, or that of the reasons, our grand appeal is to the asserted fact of
the Lord's Second Coming at the time and in the manner which Swedenborg
maintains. As this lies at the foundation of the whole matter, we are warranted
to demand that this question shall first of all be considered, and. the exegetical
error, if it be an error, which we have embraced, be pointed out. It is to be
shown also that the asserted relation between the Second Advent and the usher
ing in of that grand final dispensation termed the New Jerusalem, and announced
in the closing chapters of the Apocalypse, is a fallacy. Every other professed
refutation of Swedenborg's scheme which I have seen is as barren of argument
on this head as your own. They seem determined to assault the fabric of the-dis-
closures at every point but the right one. Not the slightest impression, however,
can ever be made on the faith of Swedenborg's advocates, except by an expo
sure of the falsity of their views on this cardinal tenet of the Lord's Second Com
ing. The very attempt at such an exposure is still in future The prevailing
Church seems to have agreed, by common consent, to waive every discussion
which involves the question of esdudology, or the doctrine of tlie consummation. My
own belief is that they dare not touch
it,
from a certain prophetic intuition, that
as they do not know precisely what the Scriptures mean on this head, the dis
placement of
a
single stone would be followed by the subversion of the whole
theological edifice which ages have conspired to build and which they are vir
tually pledged to uphold.
If
by any possibility
it
should appear, that the Second
Advent has already taken place, or
is
now in the course of accomplishment,
what becomes of the General Judgment, the Resurrection, and the End of the
World, all which, in the established belief, are inseparably linked with the Ad
vent
?
They must necessarily
" shoot madly from their spheres," and the
scheme will be seen to break up like the dissolving of a constellation in the heav
ens, the stars bidding farewell to each other. If, however, any other reason can
be assigned for the stern refusal to consider this feature of our system,
I
shall
readily withdraw my imputation. As the subject lies before our own minds, we
see nothing more reasonable or probable, than that the occurrence of such a
stupendous event as the Second Advent of the Lord should be attended with the
in-flowing into the human mind of new light and truth from heaven relative to
the spiritual world—to heaven and hell —and to the nature and destiny of the
human soul. The grand object of that Advent we conceive to be, to pour
a
flood
of light upon the connection between the inner and the outer world
;
to reinstate re
generate man in the lost prerogatives of his creation
;
and we see no mode of ac
complishing this so analogous to the ordinary procedures of the Divine Wisdom,
as to select and endow an individual for the purpose, and make him the deposi
tory of the revelation for the benefit of his fellow-men. In this then we perceive
an abundant fulness of reasons to warrant the claim which he makes.
And then as to the kind
of
evidence by which such an illumination
is
to be au
thenticated, we know not what to ask for which we do not find. We cannot
rely upon miracles, for your own reasoning shows that whatever might be the
testimony of then' truth, they would not be believed to be miracles, but would

be explained away by some plausible solution on the score of juggling, legerde
main, or occult arts. After citing the facts mentioned by Kant in proof of Sweden-
berg's intercourse with the spiritual world, and his supernatural knowledge, you
say ;—" I shall not undertake to search out the hidden causes of these marvellous
events. The means of doing this are not in my power. But what then ? We
have heard stories of fortune tellers, jugglers, and dreamers, and persons mag
netized, quite as unaccountable and astounding as these. And who can ac
count for some of the feats of insanity ?" Again you say, that you would not un
dertake to disprove the authenticity of the stories related of Swedenborg, and
why ? Because, forsooth, in all ages wizards and witches have said and done
things seemingly preternatural and very astonishing. Now as a somewhat curi
ous specimen of the different manner in which the same things will strike
different minds, 1 adduce a short extract from a very elaborate article on Swe
denborg in the Southern Quarterly Review (Oct. 1846). After citing in full there-;
lations to which you allude, the writer adds ;—" It would be easy to multiply
cases equally remarkable —but these will suffice. Such testimony would be ad
mitted, be respected, and obtain confidence in any court in Christendom. Of
what does it consist ? Not of the solitary declaration of a single individual,
whose motives might be suspected, but of a combination of concurring testimo
nies from different quarters and different persons, of the , highest character, so
that if there is any force in human testimony at all, we have just as much author
ity for believing that Swedenborg had intercourse with the spiritual world, as
we have for believing that Victoria is the present reigning Queen of Great
Britain."
I ask then, my dear sir, if it is not clear, that were the evidence of these al
leged facts increased an hundred fold, they would still be powerless to work, in
your-mind, a conviction of their supernatural character ? The preconceived
idea that the age of miraculous manifestations is past, is doubtless so rooted
and grounded within you, that all testimony to the contrary would be unavailing,
and you would consider it to be your duty to reject
it,
as you could scarcely
conceive its admission in any other light than as derogatory to the fulness and
sufficiency of the Scriptural revelation.
I
do not speak of this as by any means
a peculiarity of your own mind above that of other men.
It
is
merely the
assertion of a general fact, arising from the operation of general causes, and
producing with us an overwhelming conviction, that the evidence of miracles in
support of such revelations as Swedenborg has given, would be totally inappo
site. We see therefore the superlative wisdom evinced in his disclaimer of
miracles as the guaranty of his truth. He refers directly to the internal evidence
of what he professes to make known, .both in the department of doctrine and
disclosure. The force of this evidence, however, will make itself felt more in
regard to the principles than to the details of the system. As the asserted phe
nomena of the other life cannot be verified by experience in the present world,
we can only judge of them" by their accordance with what we are able to ascertain
of the deeper psychological laws of our being, and by their moral tendencies.
If
there
is
nothing in these respects inconsistent with our soundest inductions
;
if,
on the other hand, they are seen to build themselves upon

basis, and the results announced flow legitimately from the principles assumed,

unseen ' For ourselves, we are constrained unanimously to say, that the dis
closures in question do abide the most rigid ordeal to which we have been able
to submit them. From the most thorough and careful investigation of which we
are capable, we have attained to an unwavering assurance in our own minds
that Swedenborg's developments of the state of spirits must be true, because they
are founded on a doctrine of the nature of spirits which we believe to be im-
pregnably sound. If this evidence is not decisive with others, our only solution
is, that they have not weighed the data as we have ; and we feel at liberty to
draw this inference, inasmuch as our opponents do not meet us in argument on
the soundness of the data, but on the absurdity of the conclusion. They cannot
see how it is possible that such representations as they find in Swedenborg's vis
ions of the scenes of the other life should be true. But do they know that they
are not true ? If so, it can only be by knowing that the laws of mind, of which
they are the result, are not what Swedenborg and all his adherents affirm them
to be. If they know this, why do they not make known their knowledge ?
Why not expose the fallacy of our fundamental principles, instead of holding up to
ridicule and odium what may be termed the detail) of the revelations ? These
principles are, that man lives after the death of the body " a real and true man,"
as you have yourself expressed it—that as the body is necessarily the elaboration
of the soul, or essential principle, of the man, just as the body of a tree is the pro
duct of its soul or organizing life, so the spiritual man is of the same form with
the natural or corporeal man —that in the other life he has perceptive and sensi
tive powers as really as he has here —consequently that he has there appropriate
objects of perception and sensation—that still these objects, as they cannot be
material, must be spiritual, and if spiritual, mental, that is to say, they must be
an exterior objective development of all those thoughts, feelings, and affections,
which are stored up in the minds of spirits, and which are thus adumbrated in
corresponding forms of scenery, whether beautiful and splendid, or hideous and
revolting. This is Swedenborg's view of the other life, and the question is,
whether it is psychologically true or false ? If the fact be not thus, how is it ?
What theory do you propose of the phenomena of the spirit-world ? You cannot
pronounce it false, except from its discrepancy with some other view which you
believe to be true, or more true. What is this ? I have the greatest curiosity to
know what is the counter-statement which you have to offer on this head.
Have you any ? I suspect not ; and the only reply which I anticipate is, that
we neither know, nor can know, anything on the subject —that it is something
wisely reserved, as a terra incognita, from human intelligence —and that the light
of that world alone can reveal its verities. This, I am satisfied, is all that can be
said by way of denial and offset to Swedenborg's declarations. And yet is this
validly urged ? The knowledge is surely possible, if God sees fit to grant it. It
was possible to Swedenborg, provided Infinite Wisdom was pleased to make him
a recipient of it. It is possible to us, if it was possible for Swedenborg to impart
it,
and without the design of its being imparted to us, we cannot well conceive
of its being imparted to him. We are therefore perfectly convinced ourselves
that the above opinion
is
unfounded
;
but we cannot convince others. He that
is
wise must here be wise for himself. We can, however, enter very fully into
the state of mind which judges of our position. We can easily perceive that

know. The knowledge of our opponents pronounces an internal judgment on
our non-knowledge. That is to say, they profess to know that we cannot know
certain things which they do not know themselves —their nescience being made
to nullify our science. This renders the case very similar to that in which one
man has an inward conviction that another cannot possibly have the same evi
dence of the truth of certain doctrines that he has of their falsity, and who conse
quently feels constrained to doubt of the other's moral state. But I have before
ventured to say, that this is an extremely fallacious ground of judgment, inasmuch
as no merely intellectual form of belief is an infallible criterion ofmoral state ; for the
Divine Good, the only principle of eternal life, may flow more freely into the
mental falsities of one man than into the truths of another. " The truths of
faith," says Swedenborg, " are vessels receptive of good, and they receive good
in proportion as man recedes from evil ; for good is continually flowing in from
the Lord, but it is the evil of life which hinders it being received in the truths
which are with man, in his memory or science ; hence as far as man recedes
from evil, so far good enters and applies itself into his truths ; then the truth of
faith becomes with him the good of faith. Man indeed may know truth, and also
make confession thereof from some worldly motive, yea, and even be persuaded
that it is truth, but still this truth does not live in him so long as he is in the life of
evil ; for such a man is like a tree on which are leaves and no fruit, and that truth
is like light in which is no heat, as is the case in winter, when nothing grows ;
but when heat is in
it,
then
it
is
like light in the time of spring, when all things
begin to vegetate
."
Again, " That truths, which are in themselves truths, with
one person are more true, with another less true, with some altogether untrue,
yea false, may appear from almost all those things which in themselves are
true, for they vary with the man with whom they are, according to his af
fections." From this
it
appears that but little
is
to be made of the most confi
dent style of predication as to points of mere doctrinal import, when their relation
to life
is
overlooked.
I
do not assume the entire parallelism of the two cases, but
I
hesitate not to
affirm that
it
is
as incompetent for you to sit in judgment upon our intellectual
state, in view of the assent we yield to Swedenborg's disclosures, as
it
is
to pro
nounce upon our moral state in view of the faith we repose in his doctrines.
We say that we are assured of their truth because we are assured of the truth of
the principles on which they rest, and these principles appeal to our intuitions
and inductions. That they do not command the same assent with you,
is
no
adequate evidence that the process of conviction in our minds
is
fallacious and
sophistical. There are
a
thousand hidden causes that mould the form and go
vern the law of mental operations on
a
subject like the present, and one mind
cannot, on good grounds, ignore the results which another reaches,
if
its inqui
ries have been conducted with intelligence, caution and candor, and even of this

spiritual world as Swedenborg professes to communicate, is, in the present life,
unattainable. Our position, therefore, relative to Swedenborg's revelations of
the other world is affirmative. Yours, in relation to ours, is not in reality even
negative, for you do not assume that it is false, only you do not find evidence
that it is true. In these circumstances it can scarcely be expected that our pos
itive assent should be at all weakened by the force of arguments which at best
can go only to produce a demur as to the confidence of belief, especially when
they fall so far short of touching the groundwork of our conviction.
Havijag thus presented what I conceive to be the true principles on which I
conceive the question of the " visions" is to be determined, I shall forego the ex
amination of the various specific items in this department to which you allude.
The remarks which hold good of one hold good of all. They come into the same
category, and are to be determined by the same rules.
As to the alleged parallel to the case of Swedenborg —parallel in kind, though
not in degree —which you have, with a gravity that I scarce know how to ac
count for, brought forward from the cells of the Lunatic Asylum at Worcester,
you will excuse me if I should appear somewhat summary in my disposal of it.
Its introduction at all into your work strikes me as a singular procedure. Had
the young man himself, in some of his ecstatic flights, taken it into his head to
draw such a parallel, I should not have been so much surprised ; but to find
such a case seriously cited by yourself as in any manner or measure akin to that
of Swedenborg, almost moves the question, whether we are not all demented to
gether, and alike " walking in a vain show." For the benefit of those who have
not seen your book I will quote a few sentences from these illuminated letters.
The reader will then be better able to judge of the correctness of the opinion,
" that there was no greater difference between the visions of the two men, than
there was between their previous acquisitions and habits of mind."

" Gentlemen :—It is with the most hearty feelings for the welfare of mankind
that I take my pen again this morning. Permit me to request you to preserve
carefully all of my writings. I do not write as I once did. I am every moment
conscious that my pen is moved by the Holy Ghost. I know that what I write is
worthy of consideration, because it is not myself as I once was that writes, but
God who uses me as his instrument. And I am willing to clothe myself with
those humble feelings that David had when he met Goliah.
" No mortal on earth is able to appreciate fully my views and feelings. I have
been taken down to the depths of hell —I have been raised to the sublimest
heights of heaven; and now I am lodged again, self-balanced, and in perfect
health, on this orb, our earth, where I expect, to spend some centuries in a ca
pacity like to that of Howard the philanthropist, only more glorious, as the com
ing of the Son of Man is more glorious than the coming of La Fayette, or any
other event in earth's history. Cheerfully will I at any time yield my title to him
who will prove himself superior to myself. Who can fail to see how the ele
ments all over the earth are working with me in this glorious enterprize. Who
is it that withholds the snow from the earth, and then gives it at the appointed
time, unless it be my Father who hath determined to put the government upon
my shoulders, as I am convinced from the wonderful manner he hath wrought
with me, and from the unexpected ways he hath communicated knowledge to
me. I am a wonder to myself; and yet so long have I been filled with wonder
that I have familiarized my mind to it, and have nothing to do but to be ac
tive in my high calling. Though I write for myself, yet my testimony is true.
Though I write as a man, yet I hesitate not to say, under the circumstances in
which I am placed, that I feel like a God, even as Jesus did."— -p. 102.

" Gentlemen :—It is my duty to visit each of the States of our Union with the
least possible delay. It is your duty to further this project by giving notice in
the public papers. This winter and coming spring would be a favorable time to
visit the southern States. God's time is always now. Men are too apt to wait
for useless ceremony. 1 have no time to spend in idle visiting among friends.
Do the planets stop their revolutions while men sleep, or does water cease to
flow ? I ought to address large bodies of people in all our States, and then go
to Europe, and leave the press to follow on in my wake, or in other people's
wake, just as it pleases." —p. 104.
" Now read, if you please, gentlemen, the 45th Psalm, and the three or four
exceedingly sublime Psalms which follow. There you will see my person spo
ken of very particularly, as well as the great glory of the church. If you say
can this be so? Then I assure you I have trampled on hell, death, the grave,
and devils, and am triumphant above principalities and powers, in heavenly
places in Christ Jesus." —p. 105.
" Now, gentlemen, I propose that we name the days of the week after objects
that really exist in nature, and about which there can be no dispute but that they
were made by the Infinite One above us. I know of no objects more suitable to
select than flowers. These being common all over the earth, their appropriate
ness will be readily seen.
" I hope to write you to morrow." —p. 108.
" Gentlemen :—Let me now mention the proposed names for the days of the
-week; Rose-day, Pink-day, Jessamine-day, Lilly-day, Violet-day, Tulip-day,
Dahlia-day. To us these names may at first seem rather awkward, though I
am sure none can fail of seeing a beauty in them. And what could be more ap
propriate than for the daughters of a family to go into the garden, on the
first day of the week, and select a boquet of Roses of various forms and colors
and set them up in the parlor as the god (if I may so speak) of that day. How
much less danger there would be in worshiping a boquet of Roses, than in wor
shipping the Penates of the Romans. Besides, no one, it would seem, would be
so void of sense as really to worship the flowers, but rather that moral perfection
of character in all holy beings, to which the flowers seem to direct the attention.
Thus by changing the boquet of flowers every day of the week, a family would
have some new object before them, to turn their thoughts to the Almighty Ruler
of worlds. The change from the Rose to the Pink, from the Pink to the Jessa
mine, or some other flower that could be substituted for it where the Jessamine
is not to be had, would be apt to suggest different attributes of character which
it would be well to employ the thoughts about. And the various colors, and the
sweet blending of colors, would call to njind all that is lovely in the whole realm
of nature. Nothing that I can think of would have a better tendency to keep
God uppermost in the minds of the people, than such a change as I now pro
pose, by authority from heaven.
" Let us have Rose- day for our Sabbath hereafter, to the end of time. Then
there will have been three Sabbaths during the history of man. Let the Tulip
represent the Jewish Sabbath. Let the Dahlia represent the Christian Sabbath.
Let the Rose represent the Sabbath of Millennial glory, when David's greater Son
shall take the sceptre into his own hands and rule King of nations, and re-estab-
'
lish justice and peace on earth. Then will the nations shout aloud for joy, and
America shall bud and blossom as the rose, and our mother England will rejoice
at the prosperity of her child, when she shall sit as queen of nations, holding the
balance of empire in her own hands." —p. 109.
The above is a fair specimen of the whole. The letters are made up of the
wildest rhapsodies of a frenzied intellect, seized upon and carried captive by
the power of some dominant idea ; and yet these disjointed ravings —these ma
niac ebullitions— are thought not only worthy to be named in the same century
with, but even arrayed by the side of, Swedenborg's profound and philosophical
developments of the nature of man and the state of spirits !- the only difference

being that one is the product of the crazed imagination of a little lunatic, and
the other of a great one !
I cannot forbear to insert the summing up, a la Plutarch, of the grand points
of the parallel, which you run between the two visionaries.
" If in any respects there is a similitude between the young man referred to
and Swedenborg, it can do no harm to notice it. And however unlike to the
Swedish Philosopher the American youth may, in some respects, seem to be,
there are not wanting points of resemblance. Had the Swede a powerful intel
lect and a lively fancy ? So had the American youth, though in a much lower
degree. Was the Swede confident that he had a commission from God to pro
claim new and important truths, which were taught him from above ? So was
this youth. Were the conceptions of Swedenborg's mind very vivid and vari
ous, and were they exhibited in his writings with order and coherence ? So it
was, in a measure, with our insane youth. Had the Swede many lofty and just
and pleasing thoughts ? So had the youth. Did the former frequently manifest a
feeling of piety towards God, and enlarged benevolence towards mankind ? So did
the latter. Did the one anticipate great and glorious results from his agency ? So
did the other. Did Swedenborg feel sure that he had intercourse with celestial
beings ? Our youth was also sure of this ; and had he continued for twenty years
to be the subject of the same extraordinary excitement, as he was during the
former part of the present year, and given himself to writing, as he did for a
time ; might he not have competed with the Swede in the abundance of his
books, and might he not have made some approximation towards him as to
their quality ? I have only to add, that there are more wonderful things in the
actings of the human mind, whether sane or insane, than are likely to be known
in our day by Swedes, or Germans, or Americans." —p. 114.
To the justness of the sentiment contained in the last sentence I give my
hearty suffrage. It is a key to the solving of various solutions, by which I
should otherwise be sadly mystified.
The title of " the Swedish madman" hitherto applied to Charles the Twelfth,
must henceforth, it would seem, be made over to Swedenborg. We have lived
to see the day when his sublime spiritualities, which have moved the wonder
and enchained the admiration of thousands of sound and sober minds —which
have lifted the veil from nature and disclosed the causes of her hidden operations
—which have developed the mysteries of the soul and enucleated the central core
of Revelation —which have taught how Wisdom is wedded to Love, and Truth
to Good, and how Life is related to both —which have brought Heaven and Hell
into living conjunction with the ruling loves of man—are gravely brought into
comparison with the delirious babblings of an inmate of a Lunatic Asylum ! And,
to add to our amazement still more, it is even intimated that the powerful intellect
and vivid fancy, the order and coherence, of Swedendorg, are at least distantly
approached by the same qualities in the Bedlamite youth ! With your permis
sion I will state another parallel equally appropriate. "Did the builders of Ba
bel erect a lofty tower on the plains of Shinar 1 So did the ants construct a huge
ant-hill on the pampas of South America. If there is any similitude in the two
cases, it can do no harm to notice it."
I scarcely know how to deal seriously with this part of your work. To say
nothing of the fact, that the very attempt to make out such an affinity as you have
suggested between these cases, is a constructive charge against all New Church
men of taking leave of their senses at the beck and bidding of a crack-brained
fanatic, I would simply refer you to the extracts given in the preceding pages,

fusions of a disordered mind ? Have you the remotest conception of any dis
eased state of intellect which could possibly have originated such a train of deep,
rational, and connected thought as you find embodied in these citations ? If it is
said that these paragraphs contain the more favorable specimens of his writings,
I reply that hundreds and thousands of pages can be adduced from his works of
similar matter, and which have only to be viewed in connection with the philoso
phical principles involved, to be divested of all appearance of absurdity and to be
resolved into the oracles of a wisdom which breathes of the angelic heaven.
If such sentiments be an indication of madness, then I say with Coleridge res
pecting our author —" 0 thrice happy should we be, if the learned and the
teachers of the present age were gifted with a similar madness !" It cannot, I
think, escape you that even supposing there are certain items in Swedenborg's
disclosures which have, at first blush, the air of insanity, that some plausible
mode is to be adopted of accounting for the admixture of such an immense
mass of rationality with the reputed hallucinations. It is, I am persuaded, all in
vain to pass this over with a vague reference to the unaccountable freaks of dis
eased mental action. It is utterly unlike anything the world has ever witnessed
of this nature, and demands solution. Why shall our perpetual call for light on
this head be disregarded ? Why shall the intelligent receivers of Swedenborg's
doctrines remain under the odium of being led by the illusions of a raving mon
omaniac, when they are conscious of having yielded their faith on the most le
gitimate evidence of truth ? I have no special desire to vaunt the indications of a
sound mind evinced in the course of argument which I have attempted in the
present series of letters, but I trust I may venture the interrogatory, whether you
have met with anything that strikes you as savoring strongly of the taint of men
tal malady. If not— if my reasoning, whether conclusive or not, is still consec
utive and plausible, and not unworthy of a sound intellect —is there not some
thing of a problem in the fact, that such a state of mind should consist with a
full and cordial reception of what you regard as the veriest dreams and vagaries
of a wrecked and ruined genius ? I could fain wish that you would bring your
thoughts calmly concentrated to this point —that you would propose some ra
tional solution of a mental phenomenon which is certainly deserving of thor
ough investigation. You will of course understand me as referring to my own
case simply as a sample of hundreds of others, far more deserving of being
weighed in this connection, the subjects of which would one and all affirm, that
the same reasons which prompt the judgment of Swedenborg's insanity, would
compel a like verdict in regard to them. The pupils are all as mad as their
master, and they would be glad to be informed when the commission de lunatico
inquirendo is to be made out. Meantime, while this is in contemplation or prep
aration, I remain with sentiments of respect and friendship as sane, I trust, as
sincere,
Yours, &c.

lit REPLY TO DB. WOODS.
LETTER VII.
Rev. and Dear Sir : •
In the opening paragraphs of your fourth Lecture I am again met by the recur
rence of the convenient but gratuitous assumption of prior theorizing, on the part
of Swedenborg, on the prevalent doctrines of the Church, as the true clew to his
visionary representations. Thus you say, " It is evident that Swedenborg's
powerful and contemplative mind had, previously to 1747, perceived various
errors and perversions of truths, which prevailed both in the Catholic and the
Protestant Church. These errors and perversions of truth, which had made a
deep impression on his feelings, were carried into his visions, and a great part
of what he saw and heard, and of what he himself said, in the world of spirits,
was adapted to expose them." (p. 118). So in regard to the doctrine of justifi
cation by faith alone ;—* This was one of the points to which his thoughts were
very often directed in his visionary state, and to which they had evidently been
very much directed before." (p. 118). Thus also on anotheT page, " These doc
trines, which he had unquestionably thought out for himself before his visionary
state commenced, were continually mixed with the actings of his excited mind
after that period." (p. 119.)
I need not repeat what I have already said on the utter groundlessness of this
assumption, as far as the existence of any testimony to support it is concerned.
Instead of that I will cite a remark from the Rasselas of Dr. Johnson. " He
who will determine against that which he knows, because there may be some
thing which he knows not ; he that can set hypothetical possibility against ac
knowledged certainty ; is not to be admitted among reasonable beings," and, " if
that which is known may be overruled by that which is unknown, no being, not
omniscient, can arrive at certainty." The language is his, not mine. I should
have said, in the present reference, that such an one is " not to be admitted
among sound reasoning beings," for yours is a gratuitous assumption designed to
ward off an irresistible but unwelcome conclusion. But as this matter has been
sufficiently adverted to, I come to your grand array of doctrinal objections to the
system of Swedenborg.
I. The nature of God. " He held that God is very man." This is true, and he
gives a very good reason for
it,
viz. that man was created in the divine image,
in which
is
implied that the distinguishing attributes —the constituent principles
—of our finite humanity exist in God in an infinite degree. And
is
it
not so
?
Are not love and wisdom, or, in other words, affection and intellect, what really
and essentially constitute man
?
And are not these the distinguishing attributes
of Jehovah also
?
Is
not that sound doctrine which we find in the following
paragraphs
?
" An intelligent person cannot deny in himself, but that in God there
is
love
and wisdom, that there
is
mercy and clemency, that there
is
goodness and truth
itself, because they are from Him; and forasmuch as he cannot deny that these
things are in God, neither can he deny that God
is
a man, for no one of them can
exist abstractedly from man, for man
is
their subject
;
and to separate them from
their subject
is
to say, that they do not exist. Think of wisdom, and place
it
with
out man, and then let me ask,
is
it
anything
?
Can you conceive of
it
as of some
-ithereal principle, or as of some principle of fire
!
You cannot, unless, possibly,
as existing in these principles, and
if
in them,
it
must then be wisdom in a form,
and such as pertains to man. In a word, the form of wisdom
is
man

much as man is the form of wisdom, he is also the form of love, mercy, cle
mency, good, and truth ; because these act as one with wisdom." —D. L. If W,
-286.
After quoting the principal part of this passage, you exclaim, " such is the ar
gument of Swedenborg !
"
And^pray, is there not argument In this ? Can we con
ceive of the divine love and the divine wisdom as existing without relation to a
person in whom they inhere ? Are they not mere imaginary entities when viewed
apart from such relation ? But the moment they are concentred in a person, we
ideally reproduce our own nature infinitely exalted. We have before us a Di
vine Man, by whom alone the universe could have been created.
Before proceeding with the remaining extracts, I would remark, that I deem
it unfortunate that in rendering into English the Latin phrase, Deus est Homo,
Swedenborg's translators have so uniformly expressed it by, God is a Man, where
as the more correct version doubtless is, God is Man. It is true that the original
homo may properly be rendered a man where the subject naturally requires
it,
as
when we say, Caesar est homo, Cossar
is
a man, in which the force of the article
is
to designate Casar as one of the individuals constituting the race homo or man.
But in the present case, the object
is
to generalise as much as possible, and sim
ply to intimate, that the constituent principles of humanity exist in God, but of
course in an infinite degree. This renders the use of the article less proper as
the idea
is
thereby individualized and corporealized in a manner quite abhorrent
to the genuine conception existing in the mind of the author. What this was
will be gathered still more distinctly from what follows. He first gives us what
he affirms to be the true angelic idea of man, in which, however,
it
is
not im
plied that our human intelligence
is
incompetent to jud-ge whether the idea
is
a
correct one.
" That celestial and spiritual things are arranged and conjoined into that form
and into that image (the human), those cannot perceive who have not a just idea
concerning spiritual and celestial things
:
they think that the terrestrial and ma
terial things, which compose the ultimate of man, make him, and that without
these man
is
not man. But let them know that man
is
not man from those things,
but from this, that he can understand truth and will good
:
these are the spiritual
and celestial things which make man. Man also knows, that every one
is
a
man such as he
is
as to the understanding and the will
:
and he may also know,
that his terrestrial bftdy
is
formed to serve them in the world, and to perform
uses conformably to them in the ultimate sphere of nature. Therefore also the
body acts not of itself, but
is
actuated altogether in obedience to the dictates of
the understanding and the will, insomuch, that whatever man thinks, he speaks
with the tongue and mouth, and whatever he wills, he does with the body and
members
;
so that
it
is
the understanding and will that does, and the body does
nothing of itself. Hence
it
is
manifest, that the things of the understanding and
will make man
:
and that they are in a similar form, because they act into the
most minute particulars of the body, as an internal into an external
:
man there
fore from them
is
called an internal and spiritual man. Such
a
man, in the great
est and most perfect form,
is
heaven. Such
is
the idea of the angels concerning
man
:
wherefore they never attend to those things which man does with the body,
but to the will from which the body does them
:
this they call the man himself
;
and the understanding, so far as
it
acts in unity with the will."—H.
ty
H. 60-61.
The will, in Swedenborg's diction,
is
the love or affection principle. If such
Uien
is
man, in his essential -attributes, and
if
in these respects he
is
created
in the likeness and image of God,
it
seems not easy to withstand the inference
that God
is
a
Divine Man. On this head he speaks as follows.

"Because the angels perceive not an invisible Divine, which they call a Divine
without form, but a visible Divine in the human form, therefore it is common for
them to say, that the Lord alone is Man, and that they are men from Him, and
that every one is so far a man, as he receives Him. By receiving the Lord, they
understand receiving good and truth, which are from Him, since the Lord is in
his good and in his truth : this also they call wisdom and intelligence. They say
that every one knows that intelligence and wisdom make man, and not the face
without them. That it is so, appears also from the angels of the interior hea
vens : they, because they are in good and truth from the Lord, and thence in wis
dom and intelligence, are in the most beautiful and perfect human form; and the
angels of the lower heavens in a less perfect and beautiful one. But it is the op
posite in hell ; they who are there, in the light of heaven scarcely appear as
men, but as monsters ; for they are in evil and the false, and not in good and
truth, and thence are in the opposites of wisdom and intelligence ; wherefore
also their life is not called life, but spiritual death." —H. If H. 80.
" The more perfectly angels receive the Divine Truth which is from the Lord,
and thus the Lord Himself, so much more perfect human forms are they, and at
length as perfect do their forms become, thence their beauty exceeds all belief.
He who shall see them, as I have seen them, will be wrapped in astonishment,
for they are heavenly loves and charities in forms that are truly human. They
are such human forms because the Lord is Divine Essence in heaven, and they
who receive Divine Truth from him in the goodness of their wills, are images-
of Him."—A. C. 9503.
"For '
man' signifies, in the genuine sense, that esse from which man ori
ginates. The very esse from which man originates is Divine, consequently, is-
celestial and spiritual; without this Divine celestial and spiritual, there is no
thing human in man, but only a sort of animal nature, such as the beasts have.
It is from the esse of Jehovah, or of the Lord, that every man is a man ; and it is
hence also that he is called a man. The celestial which constitutes him a man
is that he should love the Lord, and love the neighbor : thus he is a man, because
he is an image of the Lord, and because he has that celestial from the Lord;
otherwise he is a wild beast."— A. C. 1894.
In the paragraphs that follow he developes the causes to which the errors of
the common conceptions on this head are owing, and declares that there is in
nate in all men a latent idea of God that more nearly accords with the truth, how
ever obscured by factitious falsities of impression.
" Some, in the christian world, have formed to themselves an idea of God a&
of something universal ; some, as of nature in her inmost principles ; some, as-
of a cloud in 'some space of ether ; some, as a bright ray of light; and some, no
idea at all ; whilst few have formed an idea of God as of man, when yet
God is man. There are several causes that christians have formed to them
selves such ideas of God : the first is, because from their doctrine they believe
in three divine persons distinct from each other, in the Father as an invisible
God, in the Lord also, but as to his Human not God. The second is, that they
believe God to be a spirit, and they think of a spirit as of wind, or of air, or of
ether, when yet every spirit is a man. The third is, that a christian, in conse
quence of his faith alone without life, has been rendered worldly, and from self-
love corporeal, and a worldly and corporeal man does not see God except from
space, thus God as everything inmost in the universe or in nature, consequently
as extended, when yet God is not to be seen from space, for there is no space in
the spiritual world, space there is only an appearance grounded on what is like
it [ex nmili ]. Every sensual man sees God in like manner, because he thinks
but little above the speech, and the thought of speech says to itself, '
What the
eye sees and the hand touches, this 1 know is,' and all other things it dissipates,
as if they were only things to be talked of. These are the causes that in the
christian world there is no idea of God as man. That there is no such idea, yea,
that there is a repugnance to
it,
you may know from examining yourself, aad

thinking of the Divine Human, when yet the Human of the Lord is divine. Ne
vertheless, the above ideas of God do not appertain so much to the simple, as to
the intelligent, for many of the latter are blinded by the conceit of their own in
telligence, and are hence infatuated by science, according to the Lord's words,
Matthew xi. 25 ; xiii. 13, 14, 15. But let them know, that all who see God as a
man, see him from the Lord, the rest from themselves; and they who see from
themselves, do not see.
" But I will relate what must needs seem wonderful : every man, in the idea of
his spirit, sees God as a man, even he who in the idea of his body sees him like
a cloud, a mist, air, or ether, even he who has denied that God is a man : man
is in the idea of his spirit when he thinks abstractedly, and in the idea of his
body when [he thinks] not abstractedly. That every man in the idea of his spi
rit sees God as a man, has been made evident to me from men after death, who
are then in the ideas of spirit; for man after death becomes a spirit, in which
case, it is impossible for them to think of God otherwise than as of a man : the ex
periment was made whether they could [think] otherwise, and for this purposethey
were let into the state in which they were in the world, and then they thought
of God, some as of something universal, some as of nature in her inmost princi
ples, some as of a cloud in the midst of ether, some as a bright ray of light, and
some in other ways; but, instantly, when they came out of that state into a state
of spirit, they thought of God as of a man; which also they wondered at, and
said it was implanted [insitum] in every spirit. But evil spirits, who in the
world have denied God, deny him also after death; nevertheless, instead of God
they worship some spirit, who, by diabolical arts, gains power over the rest.
It was said, that to think of God as a man is implanted in every spirit: that this
is effected by influx of the Lord into the interior of their thoughts, is evident from
this consideration : the angels of all the heavens unitedly acknowledge the Lord ;
they acknowledge his Divine which is called the Father, they see his Divine Hu
man, and they are in the Divine Proceeding, for the universal angelic heaven is
the Divine Proceeding of the Lord ; an angel is not an angel from anything of his
own, but from the Divine which he receives from the Lord ; hence they are in
the Lord, and therefore, when they think of God, they cannot think of any other
than of the Lord, in whom they are, and from whom they think Add to this,
that the universal angelic heaven in its complex, before the Lord, is as one man,
which may be called the Grand Man, wherefore the angeis in heaven are in the
man, who is the Divine Proceeding of the Lord, as was said ; and since their
thoughts have a direction according to the form of heaven, therefore when they
think of God, they cannot think otherwise than of the Lord. In a word, all the
angels of the three heavens think of God as of a man, nor can they think other
wise, since if they would, thought would cease, and they would fall down from
heaven. Hence now it is, that it is implanted in every spirit, and also in every
man, when he is in the idea of his spirit, to think of God as a man." —Ath. Creed,
19,10.
You will pardon me, I trust, for presenting this subject in Swedenborg's lan
guage, instead of my own, because of that certain indescribable self-evidencing
air to which 1 have before adverted, and which can scarcely fail to make itself
perceived by the candid reader. Especially do I rely upon this to countervail
the popular impression of insanity in the writer. I wish to afford the world
an opportunity of judging of the grounds of an imputation, under which
one of the best and greatest of men has been made to suffer in his good name and
memory, to a degree probably unparalleled in the history of the race. What
must be the astonishment of mankind when they come to be disabused of their
false impressions on this score, and to learn that it is from precisely such views as
have been spread before the reader in these pages that the charge of madness has
been brought against their author, and that he has been branded as the dupe of the
most silly and ridiculous delusions, and the propagator of the grossest outrages
upon common sense and the reverence due to divine sanctities. As such a charge

reflects of necessity upon all those who adopt his disclosures as an embodiment of
the most sublime truths, we would fain point our fellow-men, in these extracts,
to a perfectly fair sample of the ideas and doctrines for the embracing of which
we are often commended to the christian compassion of those who think it a
waste of time to examine alleged heresies before condemning them. Thus in
regard to the present topic of debate, we maintain, according to Swedenborg,
that God is very man, and we call upon our opponents to indicate distinctly in
what respects the position militates with the truth. I have expounded the prin
ciples upon which the doctrine rests —that man is man solely and simply from
his being constituted of the elements of love and wisdom, which exist in Jeho
vah in an infinite degree and which constitute Him what he is. The position can
only be denied by denying the fundamental ground in which it plants itself. If
man is not made in the image of God from his reflecting the divine love and
wisdom, how is he thus made ?—-how does he bear this image ?
But you will doubtless be prompt to reply, that if God is truly man—if He is
the exemplar after which man is formed— then he must have the form of man,
and as form, in all the reigning philosophies, is inherent only in matter, and
as, moreover, the human form exists and is manifested in the material human
body, God therefore must have a material body corresponding in form to that of
man ; and how this differs from the grossest anthropomorphism you will pro
bably find yourself at a loss to conceive. Strange as it may appear, we readily
admit that if the above chain of premises is sound, the conclusion is inevitable,
and that there is no escape from the dilemma charged upon us. Still we do es
cape. A wide and open door of deliverance we find in Swedenborg's profound
doctrine of Form—so profound, that to mere sensuous thought, which is so
incompetent to cast off the shackles of Time and Space, it can scarcely ap
pear otherwise than as transcendentally obscure. Still we should condemn our
own inductions by charging them as intrinsically unintelligible. It is to us an
intelligible idea oiform which carries it quite out of the sphere of matter, where
it is usually a synonim for sltape, and makes it the inseparable concomitant of es
sence, and equivalent to the mode in which any thing exists. So far from consider-
ngform restricted to matter, we are taught to regard it as coextensive with all
being, as we cannot conceive that any thing should exist without existing in a
form. But the forms of spirits are not bounded by space, although, when clothed
with a body in the natural world, that body is defined by spatial extension
The material body, however, genetically considered, is the result of the action of
the soul, and corresponds with its form. The one is in space, while the other is
not.
" Organic forms," says Swedenborg, " are not only those which appear be
fore the eye, and which can be discovered by microscopes, but there are also or
ganic forms' still purer, which can never be discovered by any eye, whether na
ked or assisted. The latter forms are of an interior kind, as the forms which
are of the interior sight, and finally those which are of the intellect ; these are
inscrutable, but still they are forms, that is, substances."
We have no hesitation to speak of the form of a rose, but how violent
does it seem to us to speak of the form of its aroma or that exhalation which
produces the sensation of odor. Yet this must have a form, as well as the
flower, inasmuch as it is a substance, and it is the peculiar form of the
aroma which produces its peculiar smell, although it is usual to refer this to

its quality ; but quality when traced hack to the last analysis will be found to re
solve itself into form.
As to the human form, Swedenborg thus speaks. " The first rudiment of the
human form, or the human form itself, with all and singular its parts, is derived
from the principles continued from the brain through the nerves. After death a
man comes into this form, which is then called a spirit and an angel, and which
is in all perfection a man, but spiritual. The material form added and superin
duced in the world, is not a human form from itself, but from the above spiritual
form ; being added and superinduced, to enable a man to perform uses in the nat
ural world, and to carry along with him, from the purer substances of the world,
some fixed continent for spiritual things, and so to continue and perpetuate his
life. It is a tenet of angelic wisdom, that the mind of man, not only in general,
but in every particular, is in a perpetual effort to the human form, because God
is Man." When we speak therefore of God as having a human form, we always
have in mind this interior spiritual form, from which the outer material form
proceeds, and which has in itself no relation to space.* This form, we say, per
tains to God, but infinitely. He possesses a Divine Human Form. If it is ob
jected that it is absurd to consider a human form to be divine, because form ne
cessarily implies limit, boundary, termination ; whereas God is infinite and un
bounded, being every where equally present; I reply in the words of Mr. Clis-
sold: "If we cannot attribute form to God, because it implies limit; so neither
can we, for the same reason, attribute anything to Him, or frame any concep
tion of his nature. For all the ideas we can entertain of Him, necessarily im
ply limit, inasmuch as the ideas themselves are limited, being those of a limited,
finite creature ; yet we do not, for that reason, cease to consider certain perfec
tions as belonging to the divine nature. None but an infinite being can have in
finite and therefore adequate ideas of himself; all finite ideas, however exalted,
must have form, limit, and boundary, as truly so as the senses or sensations of
the body. The objection, therefore, derived from the idea of form, is as appli
cable to all intellectual ideas, however abstracted, as it is to sensational impres
sions. Let any ideas of God entertained by a creature, however intellectual,
however abstracted, nay, however angelic or spiritual, be embodied; and that
* It will be seen from this, compared with what follows, that either Professor Stuart
or myself is in a very great error as lo Swedenborg's real doctrine on this head. In his
recently published
" Miscellanies" in speaking of objections raised against the doctrine
of the Trinity from the mere forms of expression employed in the New Testament he
says ;— " Their efficacy or validity as objections, depends entirely on interpreting lan
guage, as applied to the Godhead, according to its ordinary meaning when applied to
other things. This cannot be any more correct than it is to say, with the Swedenbor-
gians, that God has a visible material form, because man is said to be made in his image,
and because the ordinary parts and powers of a human body are ascribed to Him"
(p. 34). So again, to the same purpose, in another passage; "When the Scripture
speaks of his { God's ) having eyes, ears, hands, feet, etc. all men who do not rave with
Immanuel Swedenborg, understand these terms as being figurative" (p. 155). This
was first uuered to the world in the year 1820, and however it might have then stood as
a tolerably fair index of the gross misapprehensions prevalent, even among Theological
Teachers, of Swedenborg's tenets, one might perhaps have reasonably supposed that the
lapse of twenty-six years, during which they have been gradually spreading, and not the
least slowly in the vicinity of Andover, would have brought with it somewhat of a cor
rective of the error. It seems, howe\er, that in 1846 the time had not yet quite come
for more truthful views in that quarter. I must confess to very great doubts whether
the next twenty, or even ten years, will pass and leave such ignorance either creditable
or common.

embodiment will as certainly present a definite limitation, as any object present
ed to the senses. The objection, therefore, derived from the idea of form, if al
lowed, would tend to deprive us of entertaining any idea of the Deity whatever;
for the only other idea we could entertain is that which is formless ; hence indefi
nite, indeterminate, chaotic, confused ; which is virtually no idea, because it
has no form ; and that which has no form, has no quality; and that which has
neither form nor quality is a nonentity.
" What then ? Are we to attribute an external shape or figure to God like that of
the human frame ? The answer is, if we attribute human properties to God, why
should we not attribute a human form ; when this form is only the form of those
properties, or that which the properties assume when they are endowed with a
real substantial existence ? But it is replied, we do not imagine that God pos
sesses those identical properties, but only by way of analogy in an eminent
sense. True ; and we in like manner reply, that neither does God possess the
human form, except by way of analogy in an eminent sense. But this, it will
be said, is after all, only to deny to Him this human form ; we answer, it no more
denies to Him this human form, than the attribution to the Deity of Love, Wis
dom, and Power, in an eminent sense, is a denial that He possesses those attri
butes. God is Love and Wisdom essentially ; consequently they can be ascribed
to Him much more truly than to man ; for the same reason God is form itself;
which can therefore be ascribed to Him much more perfectly than to man.
" The objection applied to the idea of form, is, that it involves limit and boun
dary. It is evident however that, in this case, when we so think of form, we
think of it in reference to visible extension, magnitude, or space. Whereas God
has no such extension, or magnitude, nor can space be attributed to Him; for
He was before space. The fault here in our conception of form, is exactly the
same as we have before pointed out in reference to eternity. Infinite form is no
more visible form extended ad infinitum, than eternity is time extended ad infini
tum, -oi divine love and wisdom the same with human love and wisdom, infinite
in quantity.
"But it is said, form cannot be conceived of without space. Certainly, if we
imagine to ourselves a mundane form, we must also imagine to ourselves a mun
dane space; hence, as the spirit of man has a form, though not material, so it
has magnitude and space, yet not that space and magnitude which belong to ma
terial things. Hence it cannot, in relation to things material, be denominated
great or small, tall or short; no, nor even in reference to time, either old or
young; and as this is the case with regard to man's spirit, in its relation to matter,
so also is it the case, in a higher degree, with regard to the Almighty Spirit, in
his relation to creation. Hence we see the error into which the Anthropomor-
phites fell. They were right in conceiving of God, as St. Paul says, as possess
ing a form, but they were grossly wrong in the notions which they conceived of
that form, and which were merely those of the natural man." —End of the Church,
p. 393-396.
Thus it is that we explain and vindicate the position, that God is very man ,- and
from this you will readily infer in what light we regard the charge that Sweden-
borg " expressly teaches that God caunot be truly worshiped as an invisible
Being. The Apostle Paul, who represents the King eternal and immortal to be
also invisible, had no authority with him." The reply to this is already prepared
to my hands in what follows.

REPLY TO DR. WOODS. 119
" That this church is the crown of all the churches that have hitherto been in
the world, is, because it will worship one visible God, in whom is the invisible
God, as the soul is in the body. That thus and no otherwise there can be con
junction of God with man, is because man is natural, and thence thinks natu
rally ; and the conjunction must be in his thought, and thus in the affection of
his love, and this is effected when man thinks of God as Man. Conjunction
with an invisible God is like conjunction of the sight of the eye with the expanse
of the universe, of which it sees no end ; and also like sight in the middle of
the ocean, which falls into the air and into the sea, and perishes ; but con
junction with a visible God is like the sight of a man, in the air or on the sea,
spreading out his hands and inviting to his arms; for all conjunction of God
with man must also be a reciprocal one of man with God, and this other reci
procal cannot be given, except with a visible God. That God was not visible
before He assumed the Human, the Lord himself also teaches in John :
'
Ye have
not heard the voice of the Father, at any time, nor seen his shape' (v. 37) ; and
in Moses :
'
No one can see God and live' (Exod. xxxiii. 20). But that He is seen
through his Human, in John :
'
No one hath seen God at any time ; the only be
gotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath brought Him forth to
view'
(i.
18)
;
and again
:
'
Jesus said,
I
am the Way, the Truth, and the Life
;
no one cometh to the Father, except through Me. He that knoweth Me, know-
eth the Father, and He thatseeth Me, seeth the Father'" (.xiv.
6,
7,
9).— T. C. R.
787.
As to any bold impugning of the authority of an apostle in the utterance of such
views as
I
have cited above,
it
seems difficult to detect
it
in the simple intima
tion that there must be an intellectual or spiritual vision of God in order to any ac
ceptable worship of Him. In no other sense did Swedenborg teach that God
must be visible in order to be
a
proper object of worship. How then
is
it
possi
ble to make out any real conflict between the teachings, on this head, of Paul
and of Swedenborg? Does Swedenborg affirm that God
is
visible to the out
ward eye
?
Does Paul deny that he
is
visible to the inward eye ? How then
is
their testimony at variance
?
How
is
Swedenborg any more in conflict with
Paul, than Paul
is
with Christ
?

he denies this distinction and strenuously maintains that the Father and the Son

one of the essential truths of our religion, and that the prayers of
those who have held this doctrine, have had power with God, and have pre
vailed, and do prevail to bring down rich blessings upon the church and the
world. The teachings of Swedenborg on this subject are manifestly Anti-Scrip
tural, and are in a shocking degree uncharitable and exclusive. And
it
will soon
appear that they lead to the denial of all the doctrines of grace." —p. 122.

You intimate not the slightest breath of objection to the word person in connec
tion with the general subject. Not so your venerable colleague, whom I should
be sorry to think you charged with undervaluing " an essential truth of our
religion."
" I could wish indeed on some accounts, that the word person had never come
into the symbols of the churches, because it has been the occasion of so much
unnecessary dispute and difficulty." —Miscellanies, p. 22.
" I may, on the whole, be permitted to say, that the present generation of
Trinitarians do not feel responsible for the introduction of such technical terms
(as that of person), in senses so diverse from the common ideas attached to them.
They merely take them as they find them. For my own part, I have shown suf
ficiently that I have no attachment to them ; I think them, on the whole, not
very happily and warily chosen, and could rather wish they were dropped by
general consent." —Id. p. 53.
I fear the learned Professor is not duly aware that the dropping the term would*
be a most effectual mode of dropping the thing -. for nothing can be clearer
than that the accredited doctrine of the Trinity is the doctrine of three Divine Per
sons, nor do 1 see how it could stand a day, as now understood, if the word per
sons should be given up, and its advocates should fall back upon the term ctoinc-
tions. What would they then have to urge against Swedenborg's view, which is
emphatically that of a three-fold distinction in the one Divine nature and person ?
But it would seem very obvious from the following passage that Professor Stuart
s by no means strenuous for retaining the dogma in its hitherto symbolical and
technical form.
" It is time to close this protracted Note. I cannot do this, however, without
adding a word on the position which, as it seems to me, all evangelical churches-
ought to take, in reference to the doctrine of the Trinity. (1) They should in
sist on
it,
that, according to the Scriptures, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are one
God, and but one, the same in substance, equal in power and glory. (2) They
should maintain, that in the Lord Jesus Christ, the divine and human, in the per
fection and fulness of both, are united. (3) They ought not to exact from any
one, professing the Christian faith, that he should adopt any definition or descrip
tion of the word person, as applied to the Godhead or to the Lord Jesus Christ,
which mere philosophy or theology has made out, but which
is
not taught in the
Scriptures. (4) If
I
might be permitted freely to speak my own opinion,
I
would further say, that
I
should regard the omission of the word person fn aft
church-creeds as quite desirable, in order to avoid fruitless and endless controver
sy and misunderstanding.
If
any one
is
startled at this,
I
take shelter under a
name, which, although once cast out, and abhorred by many, and often covered
with reproach, now commands, among nearly all parties of the intelligent, unaf
fected reverence and admiration
;
I
mean the name of Calvin. In his Institutes,
L
13. o, he says
:
'
Utinam sepulta essent Nomina, constaret modo haec inter om-
nes fides
:
Patremet Filium et Spiritum Sanctum esse unum Deum
;
i
e. My wish is,
that all names might be buried, provided this article of faith might be agreed up
on by all
:
The Father and Sou and- Holy SpiitiT are one God.'
"
I
need not say how many anxious minds would be calmed by the adoption of
such
a
noble and scriptural sentiment, and by agreeing upon
it
as one of the con
ditions of Christian confidence and communion. My belief is, that the churches
must go back, and make more of the Bible, and less of creeds, in order to revive
the spirit of the primitive ages of Christianity. When they shall be as anxious
to promote brotherly harmony, and kindness, and true liberality, as they have for
a
long time been to inflame sectarian zeal, and increase the causes of dissension
by sectarian creeds, and to treat with severity and contempt or reproach those
who differ from them in matters unessential, then will the world once more be
constrained to say
;
See how these Christians love one another
!
Then, to use the last
words of the adorable Saviour, 'will they all be one;' and then (but not till
then,)
*
will the world believe that Christ
is
sent by the Father.' "—Id. p. 74.

These are very noble sentiments, and I am unable to discover in what res
pects the adopters of Swedenborg's system have failed to take precisely this
ground. It is substantially the very position they have taken from the outset.
Yet you remark in regard to it, that " the teachings of Swedenborg on this sub
ject are manifestly Anti- Scriptural, and are in a shocking degree uncharitable and
exclusive." That is to say, while one of the Professors of the Andover Seminary
has pointed out a position which all evangelical churches ought to take in regard
to the doctrine of the Trinity, and which the Church that receives the teach
ings
o.f
Swedenborg has all along taken, another Professor in the same Sem
inary denounces as " manifestly anti-scriptural
"
and shockingly uncharitable,
when professed by this Church, the very form of doctrine recommended by his
colleague, to the adoption of all Evangelical Christian sects
!
This must be al
lowed,
I
think, to present a specimen of rather an anomalous kind of unity in
the heads of a Theological Institute —one however to which
I
allude grievingly
and not invidiously. Instead of dwelling upon it,
I
proceed to offer
a
few re
marks on the general theme.
The process of argument which
it
would be proper to adopt with
a
Unitarian
on this subject would be out of place in the controversy with you. You will
concede at once the identity, in some sense, of the Jehovah of the Old Testament
with the Jesus of the New. The quotations soon to be adduced put that^ioint
beyond question. But the august name Jehovah certainly indicates the one
only living and true God, and
if
this name
is
applied to Jesus Christ we must
demand the authority on which
it
is
supposed to denote any less than the whole
Godhead. What grounds are there for the assumption, that itwas a certain por
tion of the Deity, to wit, the second Person, which became incarnate
?
The
plain import of the Word
is
that
it
was the whole divine nature which clothed itself
with humanity for the redemption of the world.
It
is
in Jesus that " all the full
ness of the Godhead dwells bodily." The Scriptures in teaching this teach em
phatically the doctrine of the divine unity. Consequently they cannot, at the
same time, teach an opposite doctrine. No view of any personal distinction can
be admitted, which conflicts with the great cardinal truth of the essential unity
of Jehovah. If the fact of a threefold distinction is to be acknowledged —as
it
un
doubtedly
is
—
it
must still be such as to consist entirely with the previously
established unity. Now we contend that the current dogma of a Trinity
of
per
sons
is
not consistent with such
a
unity.
It
is
not, in fact, so much
a
Trinity in
unity, as a Trinity in unanimity—a Trinity of three unanimous Gods acting in
unison with each other for the accomplishment of a certain end. This, we are
persuaded,
is
practically the doctrine received by the great mass of Christians, and
we are equally persuaded that
it
is a view of the subject which vitiates the entire
•ystem of Christianity as generally adopted. A plurality of persons will inevit
ably beget the interior impression of a plurality of essences, which
is
virtually a
plurality of Gods.
Far different from this
is
the Trinity taught by Swedenborg. This
is
a
Trinity
of Essential Attributes and Principles —Love, Wisdom, and Act —to which respect
ively answer the titles Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. In the incarnation the Di
vine Love, which
is
the very Esse of the Godhead, and economically termed the
Father, as the ground, or producing cause, of all being,
is
invisibly present in
the Divine Wisdom or Truth, the Divine Existere, termed the Son, and from both
in conjunction emanates the Holy Spirit, the Divine Proceeding or operative En

ergy and Influence by which the soul is spiritually enlivened, enlightened, and
sanctified, but all constituting one Essence and one Person. Viewed in this light
the whole subject assumes a new aspect. The cloud of mystery gathered around
it, and which has so long darkened the Christian orb, is dispelled, and the Scrip
tures became intelligible in their deepest recesses, as well as those which speak
of the inferiority of our Lord to the Father, as those which spake of his equality.
" My Father is greater than I," that is, the Divine Love, being the inmost —the
Esse of Jehovah —is superior and comparatively greater than the Divine Wisdom,
as affection in all beings is an element paramount to intellect. Again, " The Son
can do nothing of himself;" so neither in fact can the Father do anything of him
self; for the Divine Love, signified by the Father, effects nothing but by means
of the Divine Wisdom, signified by the Son ; and the Divine Wisdom, of itself, can ef
fect nothing unless the Divine Love, as its soul and energy, gives the power ;
just as affection in man acts conjointly with thought, and thought with affection.
On the same ground all the subordinate acts and offices of the Son in the scheme
of redemption are easily explicable without the least invasion of the unity of the
Divine Person and Essence. Let the fundamental truth of the whole work of
human redemption having direct relation to the three constituents of the Divine
Nature— Love, Wisdom, and Operation —and of its being designed to bear upon
the corresponding principles of human nature —affection, intellect, and action-
be understood, and the subject is, in a great measure, happily relieved of doubt,
mystery, and confusion.
You intimate a difficulty in understanding- how it can be said that the Son was
sent by the Father, unless the common distinction of Persons be maintained. But
do you see no difficulty in this in your own admitted view of the essential unity
of the Father and the Son? However explained, it must of necessity be consist
ent with that unity. What solution then can possibly be given, but that Jeho
vah sent himself into the world in the manifested Form of the Son, or as Sweden-
borg expresses it, that Jehovah descended as the Divine Truth without, at the
same time separating the Divine Good ?
" The Lord frequently said that the
Father sent Him into the world, and that he was sent by the Father, and this he
says, because by being sent into the world is meant to descend and come
amongst men; and this was done by the Human which He assumed by means
of the virgin Mary. That by the Son of Mary is meant the merely human, is
manifest from the generation of man, that the soul is from the Father, and the
body from the mother ; for the soul is in the seed of the father, and it is clothed
with a body in the mother; or, what is the same, all the spiritual that a man has,
is from the father, and all the material from the mother. As to the Lord, the
Divine which he had was from Jehovah, the Father, and the human was from
the mother; these two united are the Son of God." — T. C. R. 92. The Divine
Essence is of course indivisible, and when it is said that Jesus was born of Jeho
vah, the Father, nothing else can be understood than that the Divine Esse, in its
entireness, became incarnate in the Son ; or in other words, that the Father sent
himself into the world in the person of the Son. In this person he came first into
a state of humiliation or exinanition, and in that state, from che necessity of the
case, he adopts the language proper to an economical subordination. He is said to
have prayed to the Father —to have done his will—to have attributed to ffrm his
works. But consequent to this was his state of exaltation, in which his Human

lty was glorified and fully united to the Divinity, and he then speaks no more in
the language of inferiority. He henceforth speaks as doing himself alone all that
he promises to accomplish for his disciples. Having now become the Person
of the Father he utters himself in language appropriate to that character. " In
my name they shall cast out devils," &c.
" Behold, / send the promise of my
Father upon you." " He breathed upon them and saith unto them, Receive ye
the Holy Ghost." " To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life."
" Iwill give to every one of you according to your works." " To him will I
giver power over the nations." Upon all this you will be prepared to make
your own comments.
But you go on to say, " He holds a doctrine similar to Sabellianism." It is simi
lar in the fact that it denies the tri-personality of the Godhead, but it is quite
diverse in other respects. Sabellius held that the terms Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost were merely the names of a three-fold manifestation of the one undistin
guished essence of the Deity.* Swedenborg, on the other hand, maintains a fun
damental distinction of the principles of Love, Wisdom, and Operation, in the
very inmost nature of the Divine Beiug, and that the names Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, have relation respectively to these three principles, which, how
ever, are as far from constituting three distinct persons as Soul, Body, and Opera
tion or Action in man are from constituting him, individually, three persons. "By
Father," says Mr. Noble, " when mentioned in Scripture, is not meant a God
distinct from Jesus Christ, but His inmflst principle of Divine life, answering (to
compare things infinite with things finite,) to the soul in man. By the Son is
not meant a Divine Being separate from the Father, but the manifested Form
of the Divine Essence, answering to the body in man. And by the Holy Spirit is
not meant a Divine Person distinct from both, but the operating life or influence
of the Divine Essence and the Divine Form in union, answering to the operating
faculty in man, or to the influence which he exercises upon persons and things
within his sphere of action. Thus the whole Divine Trinity centres in the one
undivided person of the Lord Jesus Christ; and the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
no more form three divine persons or Gods, than soul, body, and operation, in
each of us, form three human persons in man." — Sermon on the Trinity, p. 19.
As to the assertion that " the Scriptures so often and so clearly represent the
Father and the Son as distinct persons" you can scarcely fail to be aware that,
even without the limits of the New Church, there is so large an amount of dis
sent as to the matter of fact on this head, that it can by no means be expected
to be taken for granted, though emanating from the highest professorial chair
in Christendom. I know not of a single passage in the Scriptures where any
such representation is made, and so long as the following passages stand unre
voked in the Oracles of Truth I can see no posibility of regarding the Son as a
different person from the Father.
* " As according to the apostle St. Paul, there is one Spirit, and yet this one Spirit
workelh several ways through manifold gifts and graces; thus also he (Sabellius) says,
is God the Father one and the same, but he pours himself abroad in the Son and the
Holy Ghost, under which names he means to designate only two different modes of ope
ration of the same Divine subject; namely God the Father. Therefore he says also,
it is one Divine Being, as to its self-existence, which is designated by two different
names according to these different modes of operation." —Neander's Ch. Hist. p. 380.

very distinct view of his teaching on the head of the Divine Personality, the
especial theme of our present remarks.*
" It has been shown that the doctrine of faith, which has its name from Atha-
nasius, leaves a clear idea, whilst it is read, that there are three persons, and
hence that there are three unanimous Gods, and an obscure idea that God is one,
and so obscure, that it does not remove the idea of three Gods : and further, that
the same doctrine leaves a clear idea that the Lord has a Divine and a Human,
or that the Lord is God and Man, but an obscure idea that the Divine and Hu
man of the Lord are one person, and that his Divine is in his Human as the soul ,
in the body. It has been also said, that nevertheless, all things in that doctrine,
from beginning to end, both such as are clear and such as are obscure, agree
and coincide with the truth, if instead of this, thatf God is one in essence and three
in person, it be believed, as the real truth is, that God is one both in essence and
in person. There is a trinity in God, and there is also unity; that there is a
trinity may be manifest from the passages in the Word where mention is made
of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit ; and that there is unity, from the passages
in the Word, where it is said that God is one. The unity in which is a trinity,
or the one God in whom is a trine, is not given in the Divine which is called the
Father, nor in the Divine which is called the Holy Spirit, but in the Lord alone.
In the Lord there is a trine, viz. the Divine which is called the Father, the Divine
Human which is called the Son, and the Divine Proceeding which is the Holy
Spirit ; and this trine is one, because it is of one person, and may be called a
triune." —Ath. Creed, 13.
You will see from this the real ground of those intimations on which you have
brought the charge of a shocking degree of uncharitableness and exclusiveness.
If the doctrine of three persons is virtually the doctrine of three Gods, as he con
stantly affirms, an error of such magnitude in regard to the central truth of Rev
elation must undoubtedly have all the disastrous effects lie ascribes to it. This
consequence is well set forth in the following paragraph. " If the doctrine of
the Trinity be a fundamental doctrine, if also we so regard
it,
it must of course
enter, more or less, into every other doctrine of Christianity
;
it
must, therefore,
enter into that of the Atonement, which, after the Trinity,
is
next in importance
;
and
if
this doctrine of the Trinity enters into that of the Atonement, then must
also our views of this doctrine.
I
take this for granted
:
—a universal truth must
enter into all the particular truths, under it. Consequently,
if
there be any trithe-
ism in our views of the doctrine of the Trinity, we must carry
it
into the doc
trine of the Atonement; and not only so, but this tritheism must be, more or less,
the basis upon which our views of the Atonement are founded
;
and hence the
doctrine of the Atonement will be, in a greater or less degree, a practical devel
opment and application of
a
system of tritheism." —Clissold's Letter, p. 24.
But
I
find, as usual, that Swedenborg's own language, on this head,
is
more
to the point than anything that
is
to be met with elsewhere.
*
It cannot but be immensely curious to a New Churchman to see such an amazing
specimen of theological crudity as is contained in the following extract from an English
Divine of the last century.
" One consequence of the end or conclusion of Christ's spiritual Kingdom as Re
deemer of the World, may not improbably be a dissolution of the Hypostatical Union
of the Divine and Human natures in the person of Christ. He assumed the latter into
the former, for the Redemption of mankind, and retains
it
still in heaven, in order to
his return, as God-man to judge the world. But the Redemption and the judgment
finished, the ground of our Saviour's incarnation, and all use of his present glorious
body, will be taken away, and therefore we cannot well suppose, he will continue in
vested with a body, how glorious soever
;
but may reasonably conclude, he will resume
that state of unclouded Majesty and Glory, of pure unmixed Divinity, he had with the
Father before the world was." —Broughton on Futurity, p. 327.

" He who acknowledges the Lord, and does net at the same time acknowledge
the Divine Principle in his Human, does not acknowledge the Lord ; for the Di
vine Principle of the Lord is in his Human, and not out of it; for the Divine Prin
ciple is in the Human as the soul is in the body; wherefore to think of the Hu
manity of the Lord, and not at the same time of his Divinity, is like thinking of
a man abstractedly from his soul or life, which is not to think of a man. That
the Divine Principle of the Lord is in his Human, and that they are together one
person, the doctrine received throughout the Christian world teaches ; in which
are these words :
'
Although he [Christ] is God and Man, yet he is not two, but
one Christ ; one not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking of the
Manhood into God : One altogether : not by confusion of substance, but by unity
of person ; for as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and Man is
one Christ' (See the Athanasian Creed). Hence also it is evident, that they who
distinguish the Divine Principle into three persons, ought, when they think of
the Lord as another person, to think of both together, Qf the Human, as well as of
the Divine, for it is said, that they are one person, and that they are one as the
soul and body. They, therefore who think otherwise, do not think of the Lord ;
and they who do not thus think of the Lord, cannot think of the Divine which is
called the Divine of the Father." —A. E. 10.
" '
And from Jesus Christ' —That hereby is signified, from the Lord as to his Divine
Humanity, appears from the consideration, that this was the name of the Lord
in the world : thus the name of his Humanity : but, as to his Divinity, his name
was Jehovah and God. It is called the Divine Humanity, because the Lord made
his Humanity divine when he was in the world ; for he united it to his Divinity
which was in him from conception, and which he had as a soul from the Father,
consequently, which was his life ; for the soul of every one is his life, and the
body, which is human, thence derives its life ; wherefore, when the Divinity was
united to the Humanity in the Lord, as the soul to the body, it is called the Di
vine Humanity. They, therefore, who think of the Lord's Humanity, and not at
the same time of his Divinity, will on no account admit the phrase '
Divine Hu
manity ;' for they think separately of his Humanity, and separately of his Divi
nity, which is like thinking of man separately from his soul or life, which, how
ever, is not to think of a man at all; still less is it an adequate way of thinking
of the Lord. In consequence of such a separate idea having place in their
thought, they pray to the Father to have compassion for the sake of the Son ;
when, nevertheles, the Lord himself is to be prayed to that he may have com
passion, in whom, according to the universal doctrine of the church, the divin
ity is such as pertains to the Father ; for that doctrine teaches, thatas the Father,
so also the Son, is uncreate, infinite, eternal, almighty, God, and Lord ; and nei
ther is before or after the other, nor greater or less than the other. This also is in
accordance with the doctrine taught by the Lord himself, which is : That he and
the Father are one ; and that he who seeth him seeth the Father, because he is in
the Father, and the Father in him; that he is the way, the truth, and the life;
and that no one cometh to the Father, but by him. Hence it is evident, how
much they turn aside from the way and the truth, who pass by the Lord, and
immediately approach the Father." —A. E. 26.
" The Lord is said to be rejected, when he is not approached and wor
shiped and also when he is approached and worshiped only as to his hu
man principle, and not at the same time as to his divine ; wherefore at this

ship him, but pray to the Father to have compassion on them for the sake of
the Son, when notwithstanding no man, or angel, can ever approach the
Father, and immediately worship him, for the divinity is invisible, with
which no one can be conjoined in faith and love ; for that which is invisi
ble does not fall into the idea of thought, nor, consequently into the affection of
the will : and what does not fall into the idea of thought, does not fall into the
faith, for what pertains to the faith must be an object of thought; so likewise
what does not enter into the affection of the will, does not enter into the love, for

which man has resides in the will. But the Divine Human Principle of the Lord

falls into the idea of the thought, and thus into faith, and thence into the affec
tion of the will, or into the love; hence it is evident that there is no conjunction
with the Father unless from the Lord, and in the Lord. This the Lord himself
teaches very clearly in the Evangelists ; as in John :
'
No one hath seen God at
any time ; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath
declared him'
(i.
18). Again: 'Ye have neither heard his voice at any time
nor seen his shape' (v. 37). And in Matthew:
'
Neither knoweth any man the
Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him
'
(xi. 27).
Hence
it
is
plain, that the Lord
is
rejected by those within the church, who im
mediately approach the Father, and pray to him to have compassion for the sake
of the Son; for these cannot do otherwise than think of the humanity of the Lord,
as of the humanity of another man, thus not at the same time of his Divinity in
the humanity, and still less of his Divinity conjoined with his humanity, as the
soul
is
conjoined with the body. On such occasions, they think not of one God,
but of two or three. To think thus concerning the Lord
is
to reject him
;
for not
to think of his divine principle in conjunction with his human,
is
by separation
to exclude the divine, which nevertheless are not two persons but one person,
and make a one as soul and body." —A. E. 114.
If such then be the real internal character of this belief, its moral influence
must be sufficiently deleterious to authorise a very severe sentence against
it
;
and whether this can be justly entitled to the epithet of " uncharitable and ex
clusive in a shocking degree,"
I
leave
it
to your calm reflection to judge. The
real question is, whether what he affirms respecting the character of the belief
is
true.
It
would give me pleasure, did my limits allow, to enter much more largely
into the developments of Swedenborg's doctrine of the Trinity. But
it
will suf
fice for the present to have shown, that the barely naked assertion that he de
nies the common tenet of three persons in one God
is
by no means adequate to
produce the conviction of his error on this point.
It
is
far from being refuted
by being simply presented as in antagonism with the popular belief. Whenever
you have more to say in. the negative,
I
shall probably have quite as much more
to offer in the affirmative.
III. The Atonement. —"He discards the doctrine of the Atonement which most
Christians regard as the most distinguishing and precious doctrine of revelation."
If your meaning, in this indictment,
is
what
it
ought to be from the veritable
grounds on which
it
rests,
it
is
simply that Swedenborg discards the established
and prevalent view
of
the Atonement, but not the Atonement in itself considered
;
in
other words, he does not discard the Atonement absolutely, under every form
and aspect. But
if
this be your meaning,
it
is
certainly most unhappily worded,
and in
a
way calculated to do great injustice to him, and in him to truth itself.
As the expression
is
entirely unqualified, the reader ignorant of the facts
is
ne
cessarily led to infer that Swedenborg recognizes, in no sense whatever the doc
trine of Christ's mediatorial and atoning work, whereas nothing can be farther
from the truth.

is
perpetually insisted on throughout the whole extent of hw
writings, as the grand, cardinal, indispensable requisite to the salvation of the

I
admit at once that
it
is
not the form
of

currency iiithe Christian world that Swedenborg sets forth; neither
is
his doc

but would
you on this account feel authorised to say, that he absolutely rejects this doctrine

128 REPLY TO DR. WOODS.
" Swedenborg rejects the common doctrine of the resurrection." Why then should
you not feel required by the same sense of justice to say ;—" He discards the
common doctrine of the Atonement ?" The question is obviously one of interpret
ation, and every view of Christian doctrine which professes to found itself on a
fair interpretation of the Sacred Oracles is entitled to be met upon the same
ground. ,
Nothing, I think, is more evident than that the prevalent theory of Atonement
is inseparably interwoven with the prevalent doctrine of the Trinity. That
theory teaches that the second Person of the Trinity, assuming human nature,
makes an atonement or satisfaction to the inexorable justice of the first Person.
To this Swedenborg and his adherents object, that it is impossible, on good
grounds, to make such an ideal separation of the attributes of the Supreme
Divinity, as shall warrant this peculiar penal and vicarious scheme of redemption.
As Christ is Jehovah, and whatever Trinity there is, is to be recognized as con
centered in Jehovah, we find no basis for such a special inter-relation of Divine
Persons or Functions in the economy of Salvation. As the very essence
of the Deity is Love and Mercy we find ourselves utterly precluded from the re
cognition of any such attribute of avenging justice as is fundamentally involved in
the established tenet ; npr, inasmuch as Jesus Christ is himself the Supreme and
Only Jehovah, do we know of any higher being in the universe to whom such
an atonement or satisfaction can be made. If then there is no other God than
the Saviour, to whom did he atone ? It was not one person only in the Godhead
(allowing the distinction) who was offended, but the whole ; how then comes
it that while the Father required an atonement, neither the Son nor the Spirit
united in this demand ? And how could the Son, who was equally an offended
party with the Father, become surety for man, while the Father could not because
he was an offended party ? Again then we ask, if Christ is Jehovah, to whom
did he make the Atonement? Did he make it to Himself? If so, upon what
principle does it become available to the salvation of the sinner ? This is a
question to which we do not anticipate an answer. i
The truth is, the whole scheme is so indissolubly connected with the prevalent
Tri-personal tenet that it cannot stand without it. In rejecting that tenet Sweden
borg of necessity rejects the vicarious nature of the atonement, and by holding
forth the attribute of justice as merely one form of the Divine Love, removes the
very substratum on which it rests. There is no such attribute as that of abstract
justice armed against the offender and requiring to be propitiated by a sacrifice.
The following remarks by the well known author of the Home Solitaries are in
perfect harmony with the teachings of Swedenborg on this head.
" The Divine Nature could not be contaminated by, nor hold communion with,
a sinful nature : and therefore there ensued a separation of God from man, which,
having every dreadful consequence to the latter, is expressed by the wrath, ab
horrence, vengeance, judgment, &c. of God,—terms adapted to the workings and
capacities of the human mind, and used to mark out its entire alienation (with
the sad effects of it) from its Maker. There is no wrath in God, as wrath, be
cause He is wholly love ; but his separation of man from the participation of his
love, with all its various blessings, operates upon the human passions, now de
filed with enmity, under the notions and impressions of anger and indignation.
Thus God's love, being pure and unapproachable by sin, becomes a most dread
ful and even horrible attribute to a sinner, because, as a sinner, he can never
come nigh to God, never hold communion with him, nor receive delight or bles

sedness from him. And if divine wisdom had not found a method of reconcili
ation, human nature would and must have sustained whatever can be conceived
under the awful idea of damnation, or the state of absolute rejection from the
presence of God. By these considerations it might appear, were it necessary to
extend them, that enmity, sin, wrath, and misery, with other words of the like
import, are all correlative terms, which only variously express the nature or ef
fects of man's alienation from God,' &c. '
On the other hand, the word love is
also correlative, and entirely connected with every other divine attribute and
perfection, or with whatever may be called by those names: it has, and can
have, no difference from tnem, however distinguished by a merciful condescen
sion, for the better comprehension of our minds. Righteousness, for instance, is
only a name for this love in act and exercise ; for the love of God in its energies
does only what is right or righteous. Love is the motive of all his actions, ac
cording to the Scriptures ; and by communicating this love, he renders it the
essential principle of all righteous action in man (John iii. 1ft; 1 Cor. xiii. 4, &c).
Truth, purity, and the like, are also but love in particular forms, actions, or as
pects. In short, all the attributes and perfections of the Divine Nature have their
essence in love, and the term love is but a glorious title for the grand assemblage
of them, denominating (as the Bible hath) the first and supreme nature. God is
love, then ; uniting, as in that one attribute, all the other predicaments and glories
of his majesty and goodness, not per accidens, but in essentiality ; and with respect
to his creatures, there is no grace nor act of righteousness but what is an emana
tion from the same principle, enlivening, invigorating, and making them happy.' "
—Hot. Solit., Art. love.
The object to be accomplished in the counsels of the Divine Clemency, is the
restoration and reconciliation of man's alienated heart to his Maker. So long
as this enmity continues it will operate to work an internal consciousness of op
position between the soul and its Divine Source. Being placed by his moral
state in a posture of antagonism with the perfections of Jehovah, the sinner feels
the Divine Love itself to be to him an attribute ofconsuming wrath. But the Lord's love
is Love still ; its nature is not changed ; and what atoning sacrifice does Love de
mand ? To say that this Love is felt by sinful man as avenging Justice is but
another form of saying that the Divine Love appears to him as avenging Justice
or wrath, and, consequently, as we have already seen that the language of Scrip
ture is constructed very much on the principle of appearances, we find numerous
passages which savor indeed in the letter of the spirit of an angry Deity, prompt
ed by vindictive Justice, but as we rise above the literal semblances of truth into
its essential reality, this apprehended attribute of Jehovah disappears and is
lost in'that of Love. By the same process the dogma of Atonement, as popu
larly held, disappears likewise, and nothing remains but that of actual recon
ciliation, which is, in fact, the true Scriptural idea of Atonement. «»
I will here adduce a few paragraphs from " Law's Spirit of Love," a work
which, notwithstanding its occasional sprinklings of mysticism, contains a vein
of the strongest reasoning in regard to the true nature and grounds of the Atone
ment which I have any where seen out of the New Church writings.
" The doctrine of the atonement made by Christ, and the absolute necessity and
real efficacy of
it,
to satisfy the righteousness, or justice of God,
is
the very ground
and foundation of christian redemption, and the life and strength of every part
of it. But then, this very doctrine
is
so far from favoring the opinion of a wrath
in the Deity itself, that
it
is
an absolute full denial of it, and the strongest of dem
onstrations, that the wrath or resentment, that
is
to be pacified, or atoned, cannot
possibly be in the Deity itself.

" For this wrath, that is to be atoned and pacified, is, in its whole nature, nothing
else but sin, or disorder in the creature. And when sin is extinguished in the crea
ture, all the wrath that is between God and the creature, is fully atoned. Search
all the Bible, from one end to the other, and you will find, that the atonement of
that, which is called the divine wrath or justice, and the extinguishing of sin in
the creature, are only different expressions for one and the same individual thing.
And, therefore, unless you will place sin in God, that wrath that is to be atoned
or pacified, cannot be placed in him.
" The whole nature of our redemption has no other end, but to remove, or ex
tinguish the wrath that is between God and man. When this is removed, man
is reconciled to God. Therefore, where the wrath is, or where that is which wants
to be atoned, there is that which is the blameable cause of the separation between
God and man ; there is that which Christ came into the world to extinguish, to
quench, or atone. If, therefore, this wrath, which is the blameable cause of the
separation between God and man, is in God himself ; if Christ died to atone, or
extinguish a wrath that was got into the holy Deity itself, then it must be said,
that Christ made an atonement for God and not for man ; that he died for the
good and benefit of God, and not of man : and that which is called our redemption,
ought rather to be called the redemption of God, as saving and delivering him,
and not man, from his own wrath. This blasphemy is unavoidable, if you sup
pose that wrath, for which Christ died, to be a wrath in God himself.
" Again, the very nature of atonement, absolutely shows, that that which is to be
atoned, cannot possibly be in God, nor even in any good being. For atonement
implies the alteration, or removal of something that is not'as it ought to be. And
therefore, every creature, so long as it is good, and has its proper state of good
ness, neither wants, nor can admit of any atonement, because it has nothing in
it that wants to be altered, or taken out of it. And therefore, atonement cannot
possibly have any place in God, because nothing in God either wants, or can re
ceive alteration ; neither can it have place in any creature, but so far as it has
lost, or altered that which it had from God, and is fallen into disorder; and then,
that which brings this creature back to its first state, which alters that which is
wrong in it, and takes its evil out of it, is its true and proper atonement.
" Water is the proper atonement of the rage of fire ; and that which changes a
tempest into a calm, is its true atonement. And, therefore, as sure as Christ is a
propitiation and an atonement, so sure is it, that that which he does, as a propiti
ation and atonement, can have no place but in altering that evil and disorder,
which, in the state and life of the fallen creature, wants to be altered.
" Hell, wrath, darkness, misery, and eternal death, mean the same thing through all
scripture, and these are the only things from which we want to be redeemed;
and where there is nothing of hell, there, there is nothing of wrath, nor any
thing that wants, or can admit of the benefits of the atonement made by Christ.
Either, therefore, all hell is in the essence of the holy Deity, or nothing that wants
to be atoned by the merits and death of Christ, can possibly be in the Deity
itself.
" The apostle saith, that '
we are by nature, children of wrath ;' the same thing
as when the Psalmist saith, '
I was shapen in wickedness, and in sin hath my
mother conceived me.' And, therefore, that wrath, which wants the atonement
of the sufferings, blood, and death of Christ, is no other than that sin, or sinful

state in which we are naturally born. But now, if this wrath could be supposed
to be in the Deity itself, then it would follow, that by '
being by nature, children-
of wrath,' we should thereby be the true children of God, we should not want
any atonement, or new birth from above, to make us partakers of the divine nature,
because that wrath that was in us, would be our dwelling in God, and he in us.
" Again, all scripture teaches us that God wills and desires the removal, or ex
tinction of that wrath, which is betwixt God and the creature ; and therefore, all
scripture teaches, that the wrath is not in God ; for God cannot will the removal,
or alteration of anything that is in himself; this is as impossible, as for him to
will the extinction of his own omnipotence. Nor can there be anything in God,
contrary to, or against his own will : and yet, if God wills the extinction of a
wrath, that is in himself, it must be in him, contrary to, or against his own will.
" This, I presume, is enough to show you, that the atonement made by Christ,
is itself the greatest of all proofs, that it was not to atone or extinguish any wrath
in the Deity itself; nor, indeed, in anyway to affect, or alter any quality, or tem
per in the divine mind, but purely and solely to overcome, and remove all that
death, and hell, and wrath, and darkness, that had opened itself in the nature,
birth, and life of fallen man." —Law's Spirit of Love, p. 67-71
The grand purpose, as we have remarked, of the Divine Mercy is the re-con
junction of the sundered soul of man with Jehovah, the only source of Life and
Bliss. But how was this to be effected f In the nature of the case it could not
be by the substitution of an intermediate being between the Creator and the crea
ture, who should take upon himself the penalty due to sin, for there neither is
nor can be such a being in the universe, and even if there were, it is impossible
to show how the translation of punishment from the guilty to the innocent satis
fies the demands of Justice, whose language is, " The soul that sinneth it shall
die." Nor have I ever seen, in all the multitudinous volumes and tractates which
have come under my eye in reference to the current doctrine of the Atonement,
any clear development of the precise mode in which the expiatory work of
Christ is made to redound to the benefit of the sinner. We are not told how it is
that the satisfaction satisfies. On the contrary, it is rather represented as an ulti
mate fact in the moral history of the universe, into the rationale of which it is not
proper to push inquiry.
Still the question recurs, How is man to be again conjoined —brought to at-one-
ment—with his Maker, from whom he has become separated by sin? This
question can only be answered by first attaining a correct view of the state to
which man had reduced himself by his iniquities, for as the Atonement was in
tended to remedy the consequences of the apostacy, the means employed must
be such, in their own nature, as to answer this end. Now nothing is more evi
dent from the infallible oracles, than the fact of the existence and agency of evil
spirits, and that these spirits live and act in conjunction with the ruling loves of
man; for likeness of affection necessarily conjoins, while contrariety of affection
necessarily dissevers. While man retained his primeval purity, he was united
to God by loving and abiding in good. By forsaking good and imbibing the
love of evil, he became separated from God, and from the eame cause became
conjoined with the infernal spirits, who were in similar loves. He thus render
ed himself liable to be acted upon, tempted, governed, made captive, and bound
by them, as a complete minion of hell. From this fearful bondage he was una

ble to liberate himself, for no being can directly will opposite to a dominant evil
love. In these circumstances, the paramount evil in man and the power of hell
mutually strengthened each other. Delighting in his chains, they were contin
ually drawn closer and closer around him, till a voluntary release became utterly
hopeless. The ever merciful Jehovah still purposed his recovery, but this could
not be effected except by his deliverance from the thraldom of the infernal hosts
by whom he had been enslaved. But an immediate approach, by the ardors of the
Infinite Love, either to fallen spirits or fallen men would have been followed by
their instant destruction. In this sense it is emphatically true, that " God out of
Christ is a consuming fire." The bright and burning beams of the Sun of Heaven
must be shrouded and tempered through some interposing medium ere they can
safely penetrate^o the infernal abyss and reach the inmost spirits of its tenants.
In this emergency the assumption of the Human by the Divide was the sublime
resort. Jehovah became incarnate and by clothing himself with our nature, in
its lowest principles and at the very extreme of its infirmities and degradation,
put himself into the capacity of entering into combat with the powers of hell
and by receiving into himself and overcoming their temptations, to achieve the
very victory which was requisite for man's deliverance from their chains. This
then was the first great work of his mediation —the subjugation of the hells in
his own Divino-human person, and the removal from man of their soul-destroy
ing influences, to such a degree as to render him capable, by the aid of the di
vine influx, of counter- willing their hellish promptings and of a new reception
of Truth, Goodness, and celestial Life. This was the essence of the Atonement,
which in the nature of tilings could be of no efficacy except so far as it resulted
in actual reconciliation. The passion of the cross, so far from having concentred
in it the chief and essential virtue of the Atonement, was merely the last stage —
the closing scene—of temptation and combat in which, during his whole earthly
life, the Divine Redeemer was engaged. The blood-swealing at Gethsemane,
and the blood-shedding at Calvary, were but part and parcel of the same atoning
work which he was all the time accomplishing from the manger to the tomb.
In this process of combat and conquest, and running parallel with
it,
was the
progressive Glorification of our Lord's Human nature, which
is
faintly imaged
forth irrthe onward course of man's regeneration. Every victory achieved was
an advancement of the Human towards the Divine, just as with the regenerating
Christian every accession to his spiritual graces
is
a real bringing down of the
divine principles into the ultimates of his earthly and corporeal nature, and a
consequent lifting up or sublimation of that nature to
a
likeness to the divine,
which must necessarily result in the glorification even of his " body of vileness."

fully glorified and united to the Essential Divinity, in those who should acknow
ledge him and accept his mercies. The sacrifice of Jesus Christ consisted in
the total sanctification and dedication of his human nature, till it was entirely
assimilated to his Divine Nature, rendered itself Divine, and made the proper
organ for the indwelling of the whole fullness of the Godhead, and for the exer
cise of air the energies of the Divine Omnipotence ; just as man's body is the
proper organ for the indwelling of the soul, and for the exercise of all the powers
belonging to the compound man. By our salvation by the blood of Jesus Christ,
is meant, in a natural sense, by his death : without which we could not have
been saved, because without it his Humanity could not have been glorified ;
it being absolutely necessary that the merely human lif« should be extin
guished before the purely Divine life could descend and take its place. And
the Mediation, Intercession, and Advocateship of Jesus Christ, include, both
the access which is afforded for man to God by the Medium of the Glorified
Humanity of Jesus Christ ; and the communication from God to man, by the
same blessed Medium, of all the gifts necessary \o his salvation. Thus most
true it is, that by the assumption and glorification of his Humanity, He made
atonement for us,—that is, effected agreement between man and God, by cloth
ing Himself with a Divine Manhood and uniting this with the Essential Godhead,
and by enabling created man to desist from that which
'
was the cause of his
separation. The prophet says, '
It is your iniquities which have separated be
tween you and your God :'—the removal then of these iniquities, and the recep
tion by man of heavenly grace, from God to adorn his mind in their place, is
the making of an atonement, an at-one-ment or agreement. This would ever have
been impossible, had not the Lord presented the graces of his Spirit in a form,
and with a power, capable of reaching man in the state of separation in which
he stood ; and this could only be, by the Holy Spirit, or divine influence, pro
ceeding from his Divine or Glorified Human Person. Before, then, such a Holy
spirit could be given, or such a divine influence be imparted, it was necessary
that the Humanity should be assumed by the Lord, and united to the Divinity.
That the consequence of this, to those who look to the Lord in this his form of
accommodation to their state, would be, the communication of every grace ne
cessary to their reception of spiritual life, is declared by the Lord when, in a sub
lime passage quoted in a former Lecture, He '
stood and cried' (as it is expressed,
tj denote the ardor of his Divine Love, and the earnestness of his desire for man's
salvation), ' If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink :'—to thirst, is
ardently to desire the truths of salvation : to go to Jesus, is to apply to Jehovah
in his Humanity as their only Source : and to drink, is to receive and appropri
ate them. The effect hereof, in enlightening the mind and imparting spiritual
life, He expresses by going on to say, '
He that believeth on me, as the Scripture
hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water ;' which the evange
list explains by adding, '
This spake he of the Spirit, which they who believe on
him should receive : for the Holy Ghost was not yet, because that Jesus was not
yet glorified.' If then his glorification, which took place at his resurrection and
ascension, and of which his death, as to the maternal humanity, was a neces
sary preliminary, was requisite for the impartation of the saving mercies here
offered, how easy is it to see what was the nature of the Atonement thus ac

the removal of the enmity in man's heart, by the communication of that spiritual
drink, which the Lord here declares is to be received from his Glorified Human
ity,—that is, of those graces of the Spirit, that living water, which the evangelist
affirms could not be given till his Humanity was glorified." —Nobles Lectures, p.
378-380.
Such then is the view of the Atonement presented in the Theology of the New
Church. While it ignores the common theory of substituted punishment, it recog
nizes and insists upon the absolute and indispensable necessity of the Lord's as
sumption of human nature and of his suffering and dying/or us—in our behalf—
but not in our stead.* We recognize the Lord in his Humanity, as a real sacri
fice offered for us, to effect atonement or reconciliation between man and God, as
Jesus says, "for their sokes I sanctify myself;" and as Paul declares, " Christ our
Passover is sacrificed for us :" not that the Father's anger required appeasement
by the sight of the sufferings of his Son, but because, when the Humanity was
thus sacrificed, that is, sanctified, and united to the Essential Divinity, the divine
influences were accommodated to man's state, so as to be operative to the renew
al of his heart and mind—to his sanctification also. Thus " he appeared to put
away sin by the sacrifice of himself."
Let me here remark that we confess to no departure, in this view, from what
the Scriptures so frequently declare respecting our being saved "by the blood of
Christ." So far as " blood" stands as an equivalent for the sufferings and death of
Christ, which we are taught to regard as the appointed and indispensable means or
medium of our salvation, we fully recognize the great truth involved in the expres
sion. But this is not its dominant sense in our vocabulary, nor do we by any
means affix the ordinary ideas of the religious world to the phrase. We cannot
conceive of the mere shedding of our Lord's material blood as making atone
ment for sin or washing away its stains. We are forced to read the term, for the
most part, as a symbol of some spiritual and divine principle which puts forth
its efficacy upon the inner man. Nothing can be more palpably obvious than
this from the words of the Saviour himself. " Then Jesus said unto them, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his
blood, ye have no life in you: Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood,
hath eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day : For my flesh is meat
indeed, and my blood is drink indeed : He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my
blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him." —John vi. 53-56. These passages we feel
* " The God of christians is so far from being implacable and revengeful that you have
seen it proved, from text to text, that the whole form and manner of our redemption
comes wholly from the free, antecedent, infinite love and goodness of God towards
fallen man — that the innocent Christ did not suffer to quiet an angry Deity, but merely
as co-operating, assisting, and uniting with that love of God, which desired our salva-
tion — that he did not suffer in our place or stead, but only on our account, which is quite
a different matter. And to say, that he suffered in our place or stead, is as absurd, as
contrary to Scripture, as to say, that he rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven,
in our place and stead, that we might be excused from it. For his sufferings, death, res
urrection, and ascension, are all of them equally on our account, for our sake, for our
good and benefit, but none of them possibly to be in our stead.
" And as scripture and truth affirm, that he ascended into heaven for us, though nei
ther scripture nor truth will allow it to be in our place and stead: so, for the same rea
sons, it is strictly true, that he suffered, and died for us, though no more in oar place or
stead, nor any more desirable to be so, than his ascension into heaven for us should be
in our place and stead." —Law's Spirit of Love, p. 96.

ourselves authorized to make a general standard of interpretation for other pas
sages which declare the dependence of our salvation upon the blood of Christ.
We are saved by a blood which can be drank. So also in regard to a multitudinous
class of kindred passages which ascribe our salvation to the sufferings and
death of Christ —which speak of the ransom that he paid for us—which refer us
to the stripes and wounds inflicted upon him by which we are healed—and which
teach us to glory in his cross. All such language is in perfect harmony with the
above view of Christ's mediatorial and atoning work, because everything of this
nature entered into that economy of means by which our recovery from sin and
death was to be effected. And we hesitate not to say that the diversity of appli
cation in regard to this term which obtains in the various defences of the popu
lar dogma of Atonement is wholly unwarranted. On what grounds are the plain
declarations of our Lord in the Gospels to be strained to accommodation with the
occasional apostolic usage rather than the reverse? We perceive, I repeat, no
violence done to the true import of the Word by our construction.*
T regret that my limits do not admit of a more extended detail of the various
features of the scheme of Atonement as presented by Swedenborg. I am aware
that your mind will still be apt to labor under some difficulty of apprehension as
to the precise manner in which this doctrine of the progressive Glorification of
our Lord's Humanity bears upon the process of regeneration in the souls of the
saved. But deeper reflection will probably lead to a clear perception of the
fact, that the requisite renewing influence which is to implant the Divine Life in
the soul of man could only emanate from God as man, and though this influence
is in ordinary theological parlance ascribed to the Holy Spirit as a Person, yet
you will scarcely fail to conclude, that it is in fact nothing else than the Divine
vivifying Sphere proceeding from the Glorified Humanity of God-man Mediator,
who, as the second Adam, becomes the true source and fountain of spiritual life
as really as the first Adam was to the race the author of natural life.f You will
consequently perceive that the grand character of this scheme, so to term
it,
is, that
it
makes the whole matter of Atonement essentially subjective.

In a word it comes near to making what you would probably term the application
of the Atonement to be the Atonement itself. It views it incessantly in the most in
dissoluble connection with the life which it imparts. The Atonement can scarce- .
ly be said to exist for him who is not positively, by means of
it,
reconciled to God
by becoming partaker of the love of God. Its object was not so much to take
away the punishment of sin by suffering its penalty, as to destroy the power of
sin and to infuse a new and divine life into the soul. By the view now pre
sented we can see how
it
is that the Atonement has this effect. On the common
view
I
believe
it
to be impossible to obtain a perfectly clear apprehension of the
mode in which Christ's Atonement
is
made available to salvation
;
and accord
ingly Dr. Magee himself, the champion of the orthodox doctrine, remarks
;
—"
I
know not, nor does
it
concern me to know, in what manner the sacrifice of Christ
is
connected with the forgiveness of sin." To us
it
is
the very climax of all the
ological paradoxes, that we are called to receive and rest in a scheme of salva
tion of the true nature and grounds of which we cannot gain a distinct intellect
ual conception.
If
others think
it
their duty to content themselves with a mere
implicit faith in a matter involving interests so vast, we do not.
From what has now been said you can scarcely fail to be convinced of one
thing —the immense diversity of the Atonement taught by Swedenborg from that
exhibited in most of the Christian schools with which you are familiar. This
is too palpable to need further enlargement at my hands.
I
will leave
it
for
Swedenborg himself to display
it
in his own language.
" What doctrine doth more abound in the books of the orthodox at this day,
or what
is
more zealously taught and insisted on in the schools of divinity, or
more constantly preached and cried up in the pulpit, than this —that God the
Father, being full of wrath against mankind, not only separated them from him
self, but also sentenced them to universal damuation, thus excommunicated
them from his favor; but because he was gracious and merciful, that he per
suaded, or excited, his Son to descend, and take upon himself the determined
curse, and thus expiate the wrath of his Father
;
and that thus, and no other
wise, could the Father be prevailed upon to look again with an eye of mercy on
mankind? As also, that this was effected by the Son, who, in taking upon
himself the curse pronounced against men suffered himself to be scourged by the
Jews, to be spit upon, and lastly, to be crucified as the accursed
of
God (Deut- xxi.
23)
;
and that the Father was by this means appeased, and, out of love towards
his Son, cancelled the sentence of damnation, yet only in favor of those for
whom the Son should intercede, who was thus to be a perpetual Mediator in the
presence of the Father
?
These and the like doctrines are at this day trumpeted
forth from the pulpit, and re-echoed from the walls of the temple, as sound
is
re-echoed in a wood, so that the ears of all present are filled with it. But who,
that hath his reason enlightened and restored to health by the Word, cannot see
that God
is
mercy and clemency itself, because he
is
love itself and goodness
itself, and that these constitute his essence
;
and consequently, that
it
is
a con
tradiction to say, that mercy itself, or goodness itself, can behold man with an
angry eye, and sentence him to damnation, and still abide in his own divine es-
life, than they had from Adam, unless such a son of man could be brought into exist
ence, as had the samo relation to all mankind, as Adam had, was as much in them all,
as Adam was, and had as full power, according to the nature
of
things, to give a heav
enly life to all the seed in Adam's loins, as Adam had to bring them forth in earthly
flesh and blood." — Law't Spirit
of
Love, p. 114.

sence ? Such dispositions are never ascribed to a good man or an angel of hea
ven, but only to a wicked man and spirit of hell ; it is, therefore, blasphemy to
ascribe them to God. But, if we inquire into the cause of this false judgment,
we shall find it to be this, that men have mistaken the passion of the cross for
redemption itself: hence have flowed those opinions, as falses flow in a contin
ued series from one false principle ; or, as from a cask of vinegar nothing but
vinegar can come forth ; or, as from an insane mind we can expect nothing but
insanity. For one point being taken for granted, the conclusions that are made
from it must be of the same family, because they are included, in
it,
and are
severally and successively produced from it; and from this one point concern
ing the passion of the cross, as constituting the sum of redemption, many more
shocking and impious opinions, scandalous and disgraceful to God, may still
take rise and go forth into the world, until that prophecy of Isaiah
is
fulfilled,
where
it
is
said,
'
The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink,
they stumble in judgment; all tables are full of vomit and filthiuess' (xxviii. 7,8).
" From this idea concerning God and redemption, the whole system of theol
ogy hath lost its spirituality, and
is
become in the lowest degree natural. This
was the necessary consequence of ascribing to God merely natural properties
and attributes; and yet on the idea entertained of God, and that of redemption,
which makes one with salvation, everything that hath relation to the church
depends. For that idea
is
like the head, from which all parts of the body are
derived
;
when, therefore, that idea
is
spiritual, everything that belongeth to the
church becometh spiritual also; but when that idea
is
natural, then everything
belonging to the church becomes natural. Now, forasmuch as the idea of God
and of redemption
is
become merely natural, that is, sensual and corporeal,
it
follows that all those things are merely natural, which the heads and members of
the church have maintained, and do maintain, in their systems and forms of
doctrine. The reason why that idea must of necessity give birth to nothing but
falses is, because the natural man
is
in continual opposition to the spiritual man,
and thus regardeth spiritual things as airy and visionary phantasies.
It
may, there-
fore,be truly said, that in consequence of that sensual idea concerning redemption,
and thence concerning God, the ways toward heaven which are those that lead
to the Lord God the Saviour, are beset with thieves and robbers (John x.
1
,
8,
9),
and that the doors of the temple are thrown down, so that dragons and owls,
and the tzjim and jiim have entered, and make
a
concert of dreadful discord.
That this idea concerning redemption, and concerning God, pervades the faith
which prevails at this day throughout all Christendom,
is
an acknowledged truth
;
for that faith requires men to pray to God the Father, that he would remit their
sins for the sake of the cross and blood of His Son
;
and to God the Son, that He
would pray and intercede for them
;
and to God the Holy Ghost, that he would
justify and sanctify them; and what
is
all this, but to supplicate three distinct
Gods, one after another
?
And, in such a case, how can the notion which the
mind forms of the divine government differ from that of an aristocratical or hie
rarchical government? or from that of the triumvirate which once existed at
Rome,
if
only instead of a triumvirate
it
be called a tripersonate
?
And in such
a
government, what
is
easier than for the devil to put in practice the old maxim,
divide and govern
?
that is, to distract men's minds and excite rebellious notions,
sometimes against one God, and sometimes against another, as hath been his
practice since the time of Arius to this day
;
and thus to thrust the Lord God the
Saviour from His throne,
'
who hath all power in heaven and in earth' (Matt, xxviii.
18), and to exalt some creature of his own in His place, and to enjoin men to
worship him, or, when the folly of this
is
detected, to destroy the worship of the
Lord Himself together with that of the imaginary idol." — T. C. R. 132.

fied by faith through the mediation of Christ, who died for us, and bore our sins
in his own body on the tree." In a subsequent paragraph you aim to cut off all
retreat from the ground of the broadest denial of the doctrine in its truest forms.
" It may perhaps be said, that he meant only to discard the doctrine, that we
are justified by a dead faith, a faith not productive of good works. But it is a
sufficient reply to this, that he expressly discarded the doctrine of justification,
as held by Luther and the Reformed Churches, and it is well known, and he ought to
have known, that this was not the doctrine which they maintained. The doc
trine which he opposed was the very doctrine which Paul taught, and which re
sults from a just view of man's sinfulness, of the death of Christ, and of salva
tion by grace."— p. 124.
It is, with the receivers of Swedenborg, a matter of very small moment what
Luther or the Reformed Churches may have held upon this or any other subject,
when we have direct access to the fountain of truth, and are competent to judge
for ourselves of its genuine teaching. Nor should we here feel atliberty, were we
forced —as we are not—to acknowledge any conflict on this head between Paul
and Christ, to postpone the authority of the former to that of the latter. We can
not consider ourselves precluded from the privilege and duty of viewing every
Christian doctrine in the light of its own intrinsic nature, in its just relations to
the attributes of God, and in its legitimate bearings on the principles of our mo
ral being. In all these respects we are sure that the genuine doctrines taught by
the Saviour of men will stand the most rigid ordeal to which they can be sub
mitted, and they, of course, must be the standard to which every other enunci
ation, whether inspired or uninspired, is to be referred. As to Luther, the world
is doubtless very much indebted to him for the noble stand which he took in op
position to the errors and corruptions of the Romish Church, but his determined
purpose to break with that Church, and to erect an impassable barrier between
Papist and Protestant, caused him to go, in one respect, too far. He might have
performed an invaluable service to the truth by reforming the error of a Trinity
of Divine Persons, which has poured a deluge of falsities over Christendom, but
in an evil hour he proclaimed the doctrine of justification by faith alone, as the
grand article of a standing or falling church, instead of that of three Essentials in
the one Person of our Lord, and thus infixed a pernicious tenet in the very heart
and core of Christianity. This will doubtless strike you as a very heavy and al
most sacrilegious charge against the memory of a great and good man. But I
abate nothing of the strength of the assertion. I cannot regard any mere man
—any man left solely to his own resources —as infallible, and in the case of Lu
ther and his Protestant followers, I scruple not to say that they have built their
doctrine of Justification mainly on a single passage of Paul (Rom. iii. 28), and
that too erroneously understood ;—" Therefore we conclude that a man is justi
fied by faith without the deeds of the law." Here it is taken for granted that the
word " law" means the law of the Decalogue, the moral law, instead of the cere
monial law, or the Jewish religion in general, which is its frequent sense in his
epistles. Again, it is assumed that " faith" imports the individual grace so
named, instead of the general Christian system, which is named from one of its
principal features.' When he speaks of faith as one of the distinguishing
graces of the individual Christian, he is very far from making it the whole
groundwork of Justification. " Though I have all faith, so that I could
remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing." This surely has very

little the air of one who designs to teach that man is justified by faith alone. It
is charity and not faith which constitutes the foundation of a justified state.
Thus again elsewhere ;
" And now abideth faith, hope, and charity, these three :
but the greatest of these is charity." Here we have the apostle's expressly de
clared estimate of the comparative value of the individual graces of charity and
faith. What can be plainer > And who can suppose that he ever thought of
teaching, that man is to be justified by the single grace of faith, and nothing else ?
It is clear, moreover, that in making the apostle teach the exclusive pre-eminence
of faith when he says, that " a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the
law," it is strangely forgotten that the same apostle asserts, and in the same
epistle, that " not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the
lawshall be justified." Does the apostle contradict himself ? Or are we not forced
rather to the inference, that there is something more requisite to constitute a jus
tified state than mere faith? The truth is, we are, as we conceive, correctly
taught that the distinction so studiously insisted upon in the Protestant creeds be
tween justification and sanctification is little else than a theological fiction. We,
at least, are unable to perceive any essential difference in the interior nature of
the two. To justify, as ascribed to God, is to make just, to sanctify is to make holy.
How does the justice or righteousness of a Christian differ from his holiness ?
In all that we have above said respecting the teachings of Paul on this subject,
we regard him as holding and inculcating a doctrine precisely in accordance
with that of the Saviour himself. The tenor of His announcements uniformly is,
that man is to be judged by the character of his works, and his works are the faith
ful index of his life or love, which if good is the very essence of charity. It is by
this principle that he is saved, and by no other principle can he be justified than
that by which he is saved. I adduce the following out of hundreds of passa
ges speaking the same language.
" ' Every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast
into the fire' (Matt. vii. 19, 20, 21).
'
He that ruceiveth seed into the good ground,

(Matt. xiii.

ren are they which hear the Word of God, and do it' (Luke viii. 21). We know
that God heareth not sinners, but

any man be
a
worshiper of God, and doeth
His will, him He heareth' (John ix. 31).
'
If
ye know these things, happy are
ye if ye do them' (John xiii. 17).
'
He that hath My commandments, and doeth
them, he
it
is
that loveth Me, and
I
will love him, and will manifest Myself to
him' (John xiv. 15 to 22). 'Herein
is
My Father glorified, that ye bear much
fruit' (John xv. 8. 16).
'
Not the hearers of the law are just before God, but
the doers of the law' (Rom.
ii.

;
James
i.

'
God, in the day of wrath,
and of just judgment, will render to every man according to his work's' (Rom. ii.

'
For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every
one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done,

ish them for their ways, and visit upon them for their doings' (Hose*, iv. 9).
'
According to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us'
(Zech. i. 6)."
What can be plainer from all this, than that a man's works or doings, the natural
product and expression of his internal state as to love, are indispensable requi
sites in the article of Justification ? Can it be for a moment supposed that judg
ment shall hereafter be regulated according to man's works, while those works have,
at the same time, nothing in them to affect judgment, consequently neither to
justify nor condemn? To justify, when spoken of a human judge, is to pro
nounce just in view of evidence. When spoken of God, who needs no evidence,
but reads the heart, it denotes to pronounce just on the ground of being made
just. It is with Him a judgment according to truth, and to suppose that all this
proceeds simply on the naked ground of faith is to contravene the whole tenor
of Scripture, as well as to set aside the clearest perceptions of the human mind.
It is nothing short of the rankest Solifidianism —an error which has pervaded
what are termed the evangelical churches to their very core, and is continually
working out the most deplorable evils in legionary multitude. You will be at
liberty to complain of this as an unjust and unchristian sentence when the truth
of my position, theologically considered, is disproved.
Indeed I am forced for myself to believe that in the controversy be
tween the Catholics and the Protestants on this doctrine of Justification,
the advantage redounds beyond all question to the former. I speak of
course of the Catholic doctrine as theoretically and not as practically held.
The following contrasted view of the two schemes is taken from " Moehler's
Symbolism." "The notions which the Protestants form of justification, is
thus briefly defined in the Formulary of Concord :
'
The word " justifica
tion" signifies, the declaring any one just, the acquitting him of sins, and the eter
nal chastisements of sin, on account of the justice of Christ which is by God
imputed to faith ; and it expressly says, our justice is not of us. With these dec
larations Calvin perfectly coincides. Justification, in the Protestant sense, is a
judicial act of God, whereby the believing sinner is delivered from the punish
ments of sin, but not from sin itself : while Catholics teach that, on one hand,
the remission of sin, the debt as well as the penalty, and on the other hand, po
sitive sanctification, follows in a like way, through the divine act of justification.
The great difference between the Confessions consists, accordingly, in this, —that,
according to the Catholic doctrine, the justice of Christ, in the act of justification,
is immediately appropriated by the believer, becoming part of his inward self,
and changing his whole moral existence ; while, according to the Protestant sys
tem, justice remains in Christ, passes not into the inward life of the believer, and
remains in a purely outward relation to him ; covering his injustice, not only past,
but still outstanding, since by justification the will is not healed. We therefore
may say, according to Catholic principles, Christ, by justification, stamps in
wardly and outwardly his living impress on the believer; so that the latter,
though a feeble and imperfect, becometh yet a real, copy of the type. On the
other hand, according to the Protestant doctrine, Christ casts on the believer his
shadow only, under which his continued sinfulness is merely not observed by
God. Hence the explicit remark of the Formulary of Concord, that the faithful,
on account of the obedience of Christ, are looked upon as just, although by vir

tue of corrupt nature they be truly sinners, and remain such even unto death.'
"
—Moehler's Symbolism, p. 194.
That Swedenborg's view of the doctrine is much more in accordance with the
Catholic than the Protestant, is beyond question. If this fact shall of itself be
deemed sufficient to condemn it, I am sure the sentence will be pronounced by
men of narrow minds, who are incompetent to see arty truth where they cannot
but see a great deal of error.
One who has been conversant, as I have been, with the distinguishing doctrines
termed doctrines of grace, among evangelical Christians, will of course anticipate
the objection that will at once utter itself against what I have now advanced. It
proceeds upon a total disregard of the great principle of Atonement by which the
demands of the law were satisfied by the death, sufferings, and merit of Christ,
and an everlasting righteousness by this means brought in, the imputation of
which to the believer is the only possible ground of his Justification —an impu
tation which is received by faith alone, as otherwise it could not be of grace.
This grand cardinal principle you understand Swedenborg as denying, and in
, this you are undoubtedly correct, as the system which he has propounded knows
nothing of any such scheme of diplomatic redemption as shall save man by a
putative transfer of moral character. It declares this scheme to be not only in
th,e highest degree unscriptural and unreasonable, but intrinsically impossible.
" That the merits of the Lord," says Swedenborg, " are imputed to men, which
doctrine is maintained at the present day, is an entire impossibility ; the merits
of the Lord are in general two —first, that of having subjugated the hells,
and second that it glorified His Humanity, or of having made it divine ; these
merits could not possibly be imputed to any man, for they are infinite and di
vine ; but by them the Lord has acquired the power of saving all them who come
unto Him, who address their worship and prayers to Him, and who examine
themselves, and shun all evils they experience in themselves as sins against
God." The doctrine of the New Church is, that " he that doeth righteousness is
righteous." It sees no possibility of one's being saved by a righteousness which
is merely imputed without being appropriated, nor can it conceive it of such ap
propriation by faith alone without the co-operation of love, and consequently it
knows nothing of a justification in which simple faith is the only principle con
cerned. Still it acknowledges no merit in the act of loving affiance by which the
soul cleaves to Christ as a Saviour. It is all the fruit of his abounding grace and
goodness —all the result of his mediatorial life, sufferings, and death. If we be
lieve, love, and obey, it is solely because we receive from Him the ability to do
it. And is not this putting honor upon his offices and giving Him the full glory
of our salvation ? How otherwise shall we do it ! If this view of the subject is
deemed derogatory to anything He has wrought in our behalf, may I ask in
what respect ? As we are very tender upon the point of rendering all due honor
and glory to our Divine Redeemer, we would fain be informed in what particular
any one of our tenets comes short of it.
It would seem that you intended to utter a very emphatic condemnation of
Swedenborg's teachings on this subject when you say, that "he expressly dis
carded the doctrine of Justification, as held by Luther and the Reformed Churches,
and it is well known, and he ought to have known, that this was not the doc
trine which they maintained." If you will read the treatise entitled " Brief Ex

position," Pfhink you will be forced to admit, that if there ever was a man who
understood, to their minutest tittle, the peculiar and distinguishing doctrines of
the Reformers on this subject, and the precise shades of their difference from-
the Romish formularies, that man was Swedenborg. The work in question
is an elaborate examen of the precise points of difference between the Romish
and Protestant symbols of faith, and for acute discrimination and masterly analy
sis, it is unrivalled. A body of flesh was never more skillfully dissected by the
scalpel of the anatomist than is the body of divinity contained in these two
creeds by the pen of our author. The conclusion to which he comes is thus
stated, after quoting largely from the Augsburg Confession.
"What nation is there upon the face of the earth, possessed of religion and
sound reason, that does not know and believe, that there is one God, and that to
do evils is contrary to Him, and that to do good is well pleasing to Him, and.
that man must do this from his soul, from his heart, and from his strength, al
though it is by influx from God -, and that herein consists religion ? Who there
fore does not see, that to confess three Persons in the Godhead, and to assert that
in good works there is nothing of salvation, is to separate religion from the
Church ? Yet so it is asserted in these words, '
That faith justifies without good
works,' '
that works aire not necessary to salvation, nor to faith, because salva
tion and faith are neither .preserved nor retained by good works,' consequently,
that there is no bond of conjunction between faith and good works : it is indeed
said afterwards, 'that good works nevertheless follow faith, as fruit is produced
from a tree,' but then let us ask, who does them, nay, who thinks of them, or
who is spontaneously led to perform them, while a person knows or believes
that they do not at all contribute to salvation, and also, that no one can do anv
good thing towards salvation of himself, and so on ? If it be alleged that the
leaders of the church have still conjoined faith with good works, it may be said
in reply, that this conjunction, when closely inspected, is not conjunction, but
mere adjunction, and this only like a superfluous appendage, that neither co
heres nor adheres in any other manner than as a dark background to a portrait
which serves to set off the figure represented, and give it more the appearance
of life : it may be said further, that inasmuch as religion has relation to life,
and this consists in good works according to the truths of faith, it is evident that
real religion is the portrait or figure represented of itself, and not the mere shady
appendage ; yea, that when good works are regarded as such an appendage,
they must be reputed by many as of no more account than the tail of a horse,
which, as contributing nothing to the horse's strength, may be cut off at pleasure.
Who can rationally conclude otherwise, while he understands such expressions
as these according to their obvious meaning :
'
That it is a folly to imagine that
the works of the second table of the Decalogue justify in the sight of God,' and
these :
'
That if any one believes he shall therefore obtain salvation, because he
hath charity, he brings a reproach upon Christ ;' as also these :
' That good
works are utterly to be excluded, in treating of justification and eternal life ;'
with more to the same purpose ? Who, therefore, when he reads afterwards ,
that good works necessarily follow faith, and that if they do not follow, the faith
is a false and not a true faith, with more to the same purpose, attends to it ? or
if he attends to
it,
understands whether such good works are attended with any
perception or consciousness
?
Yet good which proceeds from man without his
having
a
perception or consciousness of
it,
has no more life in
it
than
if
it
came
from
a
statue. But
if
we inquire more deeply into the rise of this doctrine
it
will appear as though the leading Reformers first laid down faith alone as their
rule, in order that they might be severed from the Roman Catholics, as mentioned
above, and that afterwards they adjoined thereto the works of charity, that their
system might not appear to contradict the Sacred Scriptures,' but have the sem
blance of religion, and thus be salved over." —Brief Expos- p. 46.

works contribute anything towards placing the sinner in a justified state ? If so,
how is it that a man is justified by faith alone ? If they are not brought into the
account in this transaction, how has Swedenborg misrepresented the doctrine ?
And what am I to understand by the terms of your own explicit charge, that he
" utterly discards the doctrine of justification by faith alone without the deeds of the
law ?" If you regard him as in error on this head, it can only be because you, at
least, exclude everything but faith from the requisites to Justification. Is this the
fact ? Do you maintain that Charity, or works of charity, have absolutely noth
ing to do in the process by which a man is declared to be just in the sight of God ?
If not—if you contend for something more —what is
it,
and what
is
its precise re
lation to the justifying faith
?
What, moreover, do you mean by saying that
the doctrine which Swedenborg discards
is
not the doctrine taught by Luther
and the Reformers
?
Did not Luther deny that charity, or works of charity, had
anything to do with a believer's Justification
?
Hear his own words. "Our
papists and sophists have taught the like, to wit, that we should believe in
Christ, and that faith was the ground-work of salvation
;
but, nevertheless, that
this faith could not justify a man, unless
it
were the fides formata
;
that
is
to say,
unless
it
first received its right form from charity. Now this
is
not the truth,
but an idle, fictitious illusion, and a false, deceitful misrepresentation of the Gos
pel. On this account, what the senseless sophists have taught respecting the
fides formata, that
is
to say, the faith which should receive its true form and shape
from charity,
is
mere idle talk. For that faith alone justifies which apprehends
Christ by the word of Scripture, and which adorns or decorates itself with Him,
and not the faith which embraces charity." —{Works, Part
1,
p. 47. Ed. Wittemberg.)
This
is
certainly very explicit, and much more of a like stamp could easily be
drawn from the same source.
I
cannot but ask, then, how Swedenborg has
misrepresented the doctrine, and
if
he has, what
is
the doctrine, in its true char
acter, which
is
to be considered as adopted by the Protestant churches
?
I
wish
to know whether they adhere to the Augsburg Confession, the Formula Con
cordia, which teaches that good works, which are said freely and spontaneously
to follow faith, and are called the fruits of faith, the works of the Spirit, and the
works of grace, and which are performed in a state of justification, have no real
connexion with faith, and accordingly do not contribute at all to salvation. Is
it
your belief that these works are merely the signs and manifestations of a justify
ing faith, but not entering at all into its essence and efficacy
?
I
can truly say,
that
I
am exceedingly anxious for light on this point, for in no department of Prot
estant Theology, excepting perhaps that of the Trinity, do
I
find myself so beset
with mystery and confusion as in regard to the fundamental principle of
a

ner's Justification. On the one hand,
it

ascribed to faith to the exclusion of
works, or of the moral element from which good works proceed
;
on the other,
it

it

But a dead faith
is
not properly any faith at all, and no one supposes a man can
be justified without
a
faith that is alive. But what
is
it
that constitutes the life
of faith —such a faith as actually produces Justification
?

it
not love or charity,

\
body with which the soul has nothing to do ? What is a mere intellectual belief
of the truth, however strong or confident, which is not pervaded and vitalised
by the affection of love ? And what a strange anomaly must it be in the Divine
proceedings to account a man just in the absence of the only principle which
can make him just ?— to insist upon a faith which can only be a living because it
is a loving faith, and yet exclude from consideration the very love which is its
life ? It must be confessed that we encounter a very strange theology in the ac
credited doctrine of Justification. While it is in one breath strenuously maintain
ed that the faith which justifies must be united with charity and good works, or
it is dead and worthless, yet in the next it is contended that these principles do
not conspire to the result, but that it is effected by one of them singly, to the ex-
'
elusion of the others ! But look for a moment at the intrinsic necessity of the
case. Man is composed of three grand constituent principles, viz. Affection, or
a Will-principle, by which he can love God and his neighbor ; Understanding, by
which he can discern what the love of God and his neighbor requires of him ;
and Operation or Action, by which he can bring into outward effect what his will
chooses and his understanding dictates. Now since these three parts or princi
ples together constitute the man, and not any of them singly, or in separation from
the others, therefore no man can be said to be justified, or made just, until he be
renewed in all those several parts or principles of his constitution according to
justice, that is to say, according to the pure love of God and his neighbor. This
is the doctrine of Justification according to Swedenborg, for establishing which
you intimate that he was driven to such straits of interpretation as to lay him
under a kind of necessity of rejecting the Apostolic Epistles.
" It is not diffi
cult to see that he must have found many parts of the Acts and the Epistles very
hard to be moulded according to his system. It must have been a severe and
comfortless task for him, with all his learning, and with all the help he had from
angels, to do away the doctrine of justification by faith from the writings ofPaul,
and the doctrine of the Atonement from the writings of Paul, Peter, and John.
Indeed the Epistles generally, in their obvious meaning, are so much at variance
with the scheme of Swedenborg, that he could not consistently do otherwise
than reject them."—p. 129. Again, " It is not strange that Swedenborg, with his
view of the subject, and acting as he thought under a divine commission, should
think unfavorably of the Apostolic Epistles, and exclude them from the word
of God."— p. 124.
Now granting this, for the sake of the argument, to be true, how far does it differ
from the conduct of this same venerated Luther, whom you vaunt as the cham-
is as when heat is separated from light ; thence the state of man becomes such as the
state of the world is, in the time of winter, when all the things upon the earth die.
Charity and faith, that charity may be chanty, and faith may be faith, can no more be
separated, than the will and the understanding; and if these are separated, the under
standing becomes nothing, and presently also the will : the reason why it is similar with
charity and faith, is, because charity resides in the will, and faith in the understanding.
To separate chanty from faith, is like separating essence from form : it is known, in the
learned world, that essence without form and form without essence is not anything; for
essence has no quality except from form, nor is form any subsisting entity, except iron-
essence ; consequently, there is not any predication concerning either, when separated
from the other. Charity also is the essence of faith, and faith is the form of charity ;
mst as it was said above, that good is the essence of truth, and truth the form of good.
These two, namely, good and truth, are in each and everything that exists essentially."
—T. C. R. 367.

pion of the true scriptural doctrine, in question ? In the Prolegomena to Wets-
tein's edition of the Greek Testament you find him cited as using the following
language :—" I do not wish to force my opinion on others, but I must say, that
I do not think the Epistle of James to be an Apostolic writing, chiefly for this
reason, that in direct contradiction to Paul and the whole of the Scriptures, he
attributes justification to works. Besides, that James makes such a jumble and
confused mixture of all that he treats upon, that I look upon him to have beeii
some good simple soul, who merely committed to paper some sayings he caught
hold of from some of the disciples of the Apostles."* Is not this at least some
what of a parallel to the alledged audacity of Swedenborg in ostracising certain
books of the Bible ? He, however, is under no necessity of giving up Paul in
order to establish a view of Justification which he finds set forth in the whole
tenor of the teachings of Christ and of the Sacred Writings at large. But I expa
tiate no further upon the subject at present. When you or any other defender
of the current doctrine shall see fit to state distinctly what you believe and what
you do not believe respecting
it,
I
shall hope to gain the information which will
enable me to discuss the theme more in extenso. Meantime
I
will conclude
this article by adducing two of the Memorable Relations, the one setting forth,
in strong, indeed, but
I
think, true colors, the prevalence and pre-eminence of
the Solifidian doctrine in the Reformed Churches, and the other an attempted
explanation of the act of justifying faith. You will, of course, exercise your own
judgment as to the credibility of the matter of fact affirmed in regard to the oc
currence of such a conversation in the other world. The essential question
is
in respect to the intrinsic truth of what
is
conveyed in the relation. This can
be viewed independently of everything about
it
that you would probably term
visionary costume.
" What
a
desolation of truth and theological leanness there are at this day in
the Christian world, was made known to me from conversing with many of the
laity and with many of the clergy in the spiritual world. With the latter there
is
such a spiritual indigence, that they scarcely know anything else than that there
is
a Trinity —the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
;
and that faith alone saves
;
and con
cerning the Lord Christ, only the historical things concerning Him in the Evange
lists
;
but as to the other things which the Word of both Testaments teaches con
cerning Him, as that the Father and He are one
;
that He
is
in the Father and the
Father in Him
;
that He has all power in heaven and in earth
;
that
it
is
the will
of the Father that they should believe in the Son, and that he that believeth in
Him hath eternal life, besides many other things
;
these are as unknown and as
hidden from them as those things which are at the bottom of the ocean
;
yea, as
those which lie in the centre of the earth
;
and when those things are produced
from the Word and read, they stand as
if
they heard and did not hear; and they
enter into their ears no deeper than the whistling of the wind, or the beating of a
drum. The angels, who are at times sent forth by the Lord to visit the Christian
societies which are in the world of spirits, thus under heaven, lament exceed
ingly, saying,
'
That there
is
almost as much dulness, and thence darkness, in
the things of salvation, as in
a
speaking parrot; they say also that the learned
among them understand, in spiritual and divine things, no more than statues.
An angel once related to me the conversation which he had with two of the
clergy, one who was in faith separate from charity, another who was. in faith
not separate. With the one who was in faith separate from charity he spoke

I
am aware
it
is
said that Luther retracted this opinion at a later period, but as
I
have never seen the passage of his works which asserts it, and know not upon what
authority the intimation rests,
I
cite the above with the expression of my entire willing
ness to give him the benefit of any such retraction when the proof of
it
shall be adduced.

'
Friend, who arc you ?' He replied, ' I am a Reformed Christian.' '
What

It is faith.' He said, '
What

My faith is, that God the Father sent the Son to take
upon Him the damnation of the human race, and that we are saved by that.'
He then questioned him, by saying, '
What more do you know concerning sal

' What do you know concerning redemption ?' He replied, '
It was made by the
passion of the cross, and the merit of it is imputed by means of that faith.'
Again, '
What' do you know concerning regeneration ?' He answered, '
It is

Tell what you know concerning love and charity.' He
replied, '
They are that faith.' '
Tell what you think concerning the precepts of

What shall 1 do ? I cannot do good, which is good, from myself.' He said , ' Can

What more, since salvation is by that faith alone f
But then the angel said, ' You answer like one who plays with one note of a

besides, you know nothing. Go and see your companions.' He went and found
them in a desert, where there was no grass, and he asked why it was so ; and it
was said, 'Because they have nothing of the church.'
" With him who was in faith conjoined to charity, the angel spoke thus : ' Friend,
who are you ?' He replied, '
1 am a Reformed Christian.' '
What is your doc
trine, and thence religion ?' He replied, '
Faith and charity.' He said, '
These

They cannot be separated.' He said, 'What is
faith ?' He replied, '
To believe what the Word teaches.' He said, '
What is
charity?' He answered, '
To do what the Word teaches.' He said, 'Have you

I have

" I once heard a noise as of two mill-stones rubbing against each other. I
went to the sound, and it ceased ; and I saw a narrow gate leading obliquely
downwards to a certain vaulted house, in which were many chambers, in which
were little cells, in each of which sat two persons, who were collecting from the
Word confirmations in favor of justification by faith alone : one was collecting
and the other was writing, and this by turns. I went up to one cell, which was
near the door, and asked, '
What are you collecting and writing?' They said,
'
Concerning the act or justification, or concerning faith in act, which is
itself justifying, vivifying and saving faith, and the head of the doctrines of the
church in our Christendom.' And then I said to him, '
Tell mc some sign of
that act, when that faith is introduced into the heart and into the soul of man,'
He replied, '
The sign of that act is in the moment when a man is pierced with
anguish on account of his condemnation, and when, in that, contrition, he thinks
of Christ, that He took away the condemnation of the law, and lays hold of this
his merit with confidence, and with this iu his thought goes to God the Father
and prays.' Then said I, '
Thus the act is made, and this is the moment.'
And 1 asked, '
How shall I comprehend what is said concerning this act, that
man contributes nothing towards
it,
any more than he would
if
he were a stock
or
a
stone; and that man, as to that act, has no power to begin, will, understand,
think, operate, co-operate, apply and accommodate himself? Tell me how this
coheres with what you said, that the act then happens, when man
is
thinking
concerning the justice of the law, concerning its condemnation removed by
Christ, concerning the confidence in which he lays hold of this his merit, and in
thought concerning this goes to God the Father and prays. Are not all these
things done by man
?'
But he said,
'
They are not done by man actively, but
passively.' And
I
replied,

How can any one think, have confidence, and pray
passively

Take away from man what

active and co-operative, then do you
not also take away what
is

predestinated who- know nothing' at all about the infusion of faith into them
selves. These can play at dice, and thereby inquire whether faith has been
infused into them, or not. Wherefore, my friend, believe that man, as to charity
and faith, operates of himself from the Lord, and that without this operation,
your act of faith, which you called the head of all the doctrines of the church
in Christendom, is nothing else than the statue of Lot's wife, tinkling from mere
salt, when touched with a scribe's pen, or his finger nail (Luke xvii. 32)i This I
said, because you make yourselves, as to that act, similar to statues.' When I
had said this, he took a candlestick, intending to throw it with all his might into
my face, and the candle then suddenly being extinguished, he threw it at the
forehead of his companion." —Id. 506.
V. Human Depravity. —" He rejects the doctrine of human depravity, as com
monly understood'. He does indeed assert that there is nothing but evil in man
from his birth ; that his proprium, or selfhood, as he calls
it,
is
evil and only evil.
Fut he does not regard this evil as belonging to man himself, so as to render him
personally sinful and ill-deserving. So far as
I
have been able to understand
him, without coming into the clear light of the New Jerusalem Church, he holds
that man in himself, originally and afterwards,
is
a mere recipient, and that the
evils found in him, come from evil spirits, and consist of the influxes which these
spirits inject into his mind. True, man has influxes alsofrom good spirits, and
he has a will to choose between the good and bad influxes, and to determine
which he will receive ;—
a
little like Coleridge's notion, who holds something
like this, that original sin comes to the mind of man at the beginning of his ex
istence, and offers itself to him, and that he then wills whether to admit or reject
it
;
though, mysterious as
it
is, the will always goes one way, and that the wrong
way. According to Swedenborg,
it
is
the great, leading fact in the history of
man on earth, that angels, good and bad, are constantly making influxes into his
mind, the influxes of good angels exciting good thoughts and desires, and lead
ing to the truths of faith and the goods of charity, while the influxes of bad
angels lead to falses and evil affections. And this process, this strife of good
and evil angels, with their different influxes, continues not only through the pre
sent life, but for a long time in the future world, until men, during that second
probation, are confirmed either in the truths of faith and the goods of charity, or
in the contrary; when they go to heaven or to hell according to their respective
loves. After this, those who are confirmed' in good, have influxes only from
good angels; and they themselves are angels, and are much employed in
making influxes into the interiors of other angels, and thus their good influxes
are reciprocal. These reciprocal influxes constitute
a
most important part of
the employments of the ever active spirits in heaven
;
while the counterpart of
all this goes on in hell
;
for wicked men there become evil angels or devils, and
while they receive evil- influxes from other devils, they impart the same to them."

but evil in man from his birth ; that his proprium, or selfhood, as he calls it, is
-evil, and only evil. But he does not regard this evil as belonging to man him
self, so as to render him personally evil and ill-deserving." And where, pray,
did you learn this? I am somewhat conversant with Swedenborg's writings, and
I can safely say that I have never met with a sentence having the slightest approx
imation to such a sentiment as you have here ascribed to him. The influx and
operation of spirits upon the minds of men he does indeed assert in the most
unequivocal terms, but he never intimates that this influence interferes with
man's moral freedom so as to exempt him from personal responsibility, or to
take away his sinfulness and ill-desert ? Why should
it,
any more than the sug
gestions and temptations of his fellow-men on earth
?
If one man can work
upon and inflame the concupiscences of another, and thus entice him to sin
without invading his moral freedom, why may not the same thing be done by
spirits who have more immediate access to his interior affections and prompt
ings
?
Indeed with
a
strange kind of consistency you have expressly acknowl
edged this, for you say that according to him, though man in himself
is
" a mere
recipient, and the evils found in him come from evil spirits and consist of the
influxes which these spirits inject into his mind, yet he has influxes also from
good spirits, and a will to choose between the good and bad influxes, and to
determine which he will receive." And
I
would fain inquire whether you do
not believe this also
?
Is your edition of the Bible lacking in those numerous
intimations of angelic and diabolical suggestion, which pious people have
always been in the habit of reading in
it
?
And have they ever supposed that
these spiritual influences barred the fact of their evils " belonging to themselves
and rendering them personally sinful and ill-deserving ?"
It
must certainly be
admitted to be a novel mode of controverting certain religious doctrines, to urge
against them, as objections, tenets which the objector himself fully admits in
his own system.
If
you deny the fact of such admission, you will of course be
free to say so
;
but
if
you concede it, you will be bound,
I
conceive, to state pre
cisely in what respects your ideas of angelic and satanic agency differ from those
presented by Swedenborg. That you may know precisely what he teaches on
this head,
I
will adduce a few extracts. They naturally arrange themselves, in
reference to your remarks, under heads, showing, (1) that man's proprium, or
selfhood,
is
altogether evil and depraved, and how this
is
inherited
;
(2) that
man
is
continually operated upon by influxes from both good and evil spirits*
and (3) that this fact does not at all do away his freedom as a moral agent.

" Nothing evil and false exists which
is
not proprium, and derived from
proprium
;
for man's proprium
is
essential evil, in consequence whereof man
is
nothing but what
is

;
this was made clear to me from this circum
stance, that when the propriums are rendered visible in the world of spirits, they
appear so deformed, that

impossible to paint anything more so, yet with

is
so striking,

the vilest living thing amongst all wild beasts ; and when he grows ap, and is
left to his own government, unless he were prevented by external restraints,
which are of the law, and by restraints which he lays upon himself in order to
be the greatest and richest, he would rush headlong into all wickedness, and
would not rest until he had subdued all in the universe, and had amassed to him
self the wealth of all, nor would he spare any but those who submitted themselves
as vile slaves. Such is the nature of every man, though he does not perceive it
by reason of his inability to accomplish his evil purposes, and of the impossi
bility of their accomplishment; nevertheless, if he had ability, and possibility,
and all restraints were removed, he would rush headlong as far as he had power.
Beasts are not at all such ; they are born to a certain order of nature ; such as
are wild and rapacious comit violence on others, but it is only for the sake of
preserving themselves ; and that they devour others, to appease hunger, which
being appeased, they cease to do harm : but it is altogether otherwise with man.
Hence it appears what the proprium of man is, and what is his' will. Man then
being such and so great evil and pollution, it is evident that he can never of him
self have dominion over evil : it is altogether a contradiction to suppose that
evil can have dominion over evil, and not only over evil, but also over hell, for
every man has communication with hell by means of evil spirits, whereby the
evil which is in him is excited : from these considerations every one may know,
and he who is of a sound mind may conclude, that it is the Lord alone who has
dominion over evil in man, and over hell which is with man. That evil may
be subdued in man, that is, hell, which is every moment attempting to rush in
upon man, and to destroy him eternally, man is regenerated by the Lord, and is
gifted with a new will, which is conscience, by which the Lord alone operates
all that is good. These things are of faith, viz., that man is nothing else but
evil ; and that all good is from the Lord ; wherefore man ought not only to know,
but also to acknowledge and believe them : if he does not acknowledge and
believe them in the life of the body, in another life it is shown him by living
evidence." —A. C. 987.
" I have discoursed with the angels concerning infants, whether they are pure
from evils, inasmuch as they have committed no actual evil, like the adult ; but
it was said to me, that they are alike in evil, yea, that they are nothing but evil ;
nevertheless that they, like all the angels, are withheld from evil, and preserved
in good by the Lord, and this in such a sort, that it appears to them as if they
were in good from themselves ; wherefore also infants, after that they become
adult in heaven, lest they should be in this false opinion concerning themselves,
that the good with them is from them, and not from the Lord, are remitted at
times into their own evils, which they have received hereditarily, and are left
therein, until they know, acknowledge, and believe that the case is so. That
infants, when grown adult, are remitted into the state of their hereditary evil, is
not that they may suffer punishment, but it is in order to convince them, that of
themselves they are nothing but evil, and that by the Lord's mercy they are
raised out of hell, which is with them, into heaven, and that they are not in
heaven from their own merit, but from the Lord ; and thus to prevent their boast
ing themselves before others, for the good which they possess ; for this is con
trary to the good of mutual love, as it is contrary to the truth of faith." —A. C.
2307-8.
" Every actual evil in parents assumes an appearance of nature, and when it
often recurs, it becomes natural, and is added to what was hereditary, and is
transplanted into their children, and thus into their posterity, so that there is an
immense increase of hereditary evil in succeeding generations ; and this every
one may know from the evil dispositions of children being like their parents, and
forefathers. It is a most false idea to suppose with some, there is no hereditary
evil but what was implanted, and as they say, by Adam; when yet every par
ticular person, by his own actual sins, causes hereditary evil, and makes an
addition to what he received from his parents, and thus accumulates what re
mains in all his posterity; nor does this suffer any check, except in those who
are regenerated by the Lord. This is the primary cause that every church de
generates ; so also with the Most Ancient Church." —A. C. 494.

150 REPLY TO DR. WOODS.
" Every man is born of his parents into the evils of the love of self and of the
world: every evil, which by habit as it were hath contracted a nature, is
derived into the offspring ; thus successively from parents, from grandfathers,
and from great-grand-fathers, in a long series backwards: hence the derivation
of evil is at length become so great, that the all of .man's proper life is nothing
else but evil. This continued derived evil is not broken and altered except by
the life of faith and charity from the Lord. Man continually inclines and lapses
into what he derives hereditarily from his parents: hence he confirms with
himself that evil, and also of himself superadds more evils. These evils are
altogether contrary to spiritual life, they destroy it; wherefore unless man, as to
spiritual life, is by the Lord conceived anew, born anew, and .educated anew,
that is, is created anew, he is damned, for he wills nothing else, and hence thinks
nothing else, but what is of hell." —A. C. 8550-52.
It would seem from the above that the fact of a deep, desperate, and universal
depravity is held as strongly by Swedenborg as by Edwards himself, or any
other Calvinist, divine who has written on the subject. I do not see that he
can be regarded as coming short of the most stringent demands of orthodoxy
on this head, unless perchance there should be something in the manner of his
holding the doctrine whichgoes to nullify the legitimate import of the admis
sions now made. If this is alleged, it must'be upon the ground of what he says
concerning the influxes from the spiritual world. The testimony on this score is
so immensely voluminous in his writings that I scarcely know how to make the
most apposite selections. The following however may serve as a specimen.
II. " Itis known in the church, that all good is from God, and none from man, and
that therefore no one ought to ascribe any good to himself as his own ; and it
is also known that evil is from the devil : hence it is, that those who speak from
the doctrine of the church, say of those who act well, and also of those who
speak and preach piously, that they are led by God ; but the contrary of those
who act ill and speak impiously. These things cannot be so, unless there be
to man conjunction with heaven and conjunction with hell, and unless those
conjunctions be with his will and with his understanding ; for from these the body
acts and the mouth speaks. What that conjunction is, shall now be told. With
every man there are good spirits and evil spirits ; by good spirits man has con
junction with heaven, and by evil spirits with hell. Those spirits, when they
come to a man, enter into all his memory, and thence into all his thought; evil
spirite'into those things of 'the memory and thought which are evil, but good
spirits into those things of the memory and thought which are good. That
there is such conjunction of spirits with man, has been made known to -me
from the continual experience of several years, so that nothing isbetter known.
What the communication of heaven with good spirits is, and what the com
munication of hell with evil spirits is, and thence what the conjunction of
heaven and hell with man is, shall also be told. All the spirits, who are in
the world of spirits, have communication with heaven or with hell ; the evil
with hell, and the good with heaven. Heaven is distinguished into societies ; in
like manner hell. Every spirit belongs to some society, and also subsists by
influx thence ; thus he acts as one with it. Hence it is, that as man is conjoined
with spirits, so he isconjoined with heaven or with hell, and indeed with that
society there in which he is as to his affection, or as to his love; for all the
societies of heaven are distinct, according to the affections of good and of truth,
and all the socities of hell according to the affections of what is evil and false.
" Such spirits are adjoined to man as he himself is as to affection or as to love ;
but good spirits are adjoined to him by the Lord, whereas evil spirits are invited
by the man himself: but the spirits with man are changed according to the
changes of his affections: thence some spirits are with him in infancy, others in
childhood, others in youth and manhood, and others in old age. In infancy
spirits are present who are in innocence, thus who communicate with the
heaven of innocence, which is the inmost or third heaven ; in childhood are
present spirits who are in the affection of knowing, thus who communicate

with the ultimate or first heaven ; in youth and manhood are present spirits
who are in the affection of truth and good, and thence in intelligence, thus who
communicate with the second or middle heaven; but in old age, spirits are pres
ent who are in wisdom and innocence, thus who communicate with the inmost
or third heaven. But this adjunction is effected by the Lord with those who can
be reformed and regenerated. The case is otherwise with those who cannot be
reformed and regenerated : to these also good spirits are adjoined, that by them
they may be withheld from evil as much as possible ; but their immediate con
junction is with evil spirits, who communicate with hell, whence they have
such spirits as the men themselves are. If they be lovers of themselves, or
lovers of gain, or lovers of revenge, or lovers of adultery, similar spirits are pres
ent, and as it were dwell in their evil affections ; and as far as man cannot be
kept from evil by good spirits, so far these evil spirits inflame him ; and as far
as the affection reigns, so far they adhere and do not recede. Thus a bad man
is conjoined to hell, and a good man is conjoined to heaven." —H. If H. 291-295.
This then is Swedenborg's doctrine of angelic and diabolic influx, and the
question at once occurs whether his teachings on this head represent man as a
" mere recipient" to such a degree as to take away his freedom as a moral
agent and to prevent our regarding him as "personally sinful and ill-deserving."
Out of scores of paragraphs of similar purport I adduce the following.
III. " The Lord through the angels could lead man into good ends by omnipotent
might ; but this would be to take life away from him, for his life is a life of loves
altogether contrary to such ends. Wherefore the divine law is inviolable, that
man shall be in freedom, and that good and truth, or charity and faith, shall be
implanted in his free state, and in no case in a forced state ; for what is received
in a forced state, does not remain, but is dissipated. For to force man, is not to
insinuate into his will [velle], inasmuch as it is the will of another, from which
he then would act, and therefore when he returns to his own will, that is, to his
freedom, what had been insinuated is extirpated. On this account the Lord rules
man by his freedom, and as far as possible withholds him from the freedom of
thinking and willing evil; for man, unless he was withheld by the Lord, would
continually precipitate himself into the deepest hell. It was said, that the Lord
through the angels could lead man into good ends by omnipotent might, for evil
spirits may in an instant be driven away, even if myriads of them should encom
pass man, and this by one angel; but then man would come into such torture,
and into such a hell, as he could by no means sustain, since he would be miser
ably deprived of his life. For the life of man is from lusts and fantasies contrary
to good and truth, and unless this life were supported by evil spirits, and were
thus amended, or at least guided, he would not survive a single moment, for
nothing else has place in him but the love of self and of gain, and of reputation
for the sake of self and gain, thus whatsoever is contrary to order; wherefore
unless he were to be reduced into order moderately, and by degrees, by the guid
ance of his freedom, he would instantly expire." —A. C. 5854.
" Man, so far as he partakes of what is hereditary and thence of self, would
have no life, if he were not allowed to be in evil, andnone also, if he were notin
freedom ; and moreover, that he cannot be forced to good, and that which is forced
does not adhere ; as also that the good which man receives in freedom, is im
planted in his will, and becomes as his own ; and that hence it is that man has
communication with hell, and communication with heaven." —H. if H. 293.
You have mow the data before you on which to judge how far the doctrine of
human depravity, as you understand it to be taught in the Scriptures, is denied by
Swedenborg —consequently how far it is justly subject to the odium which your
remarks are calculated to draw upon it, unaccompanied as they are with any
intimations of what you conceive the real doctrine to be, or, in other words, of
what he ought to teach on this subject in order to be consistent with truth. He

presume you also hold. He holds too that man is continually subject to infernal
and celestial influxes, in which I cannot doubt that you agree with him, if you
take the Scriptures as the rule of doctrine on this head. He maintains moreover
that man is under no absolute compulsion as to yielding to those influences,
and therefore still remains a free moral agent and of course " personally sinful
and ill-deserving" as far as he complies with the promptings of evil spirits and
resists those of the good. Do you not maintain the same ? If you still object that
there is some flaw in his reasonings on this topic, I would respectfully suggest
whether it be not in some point on which your own system is equally assaila
ble. Does not the following extract disclose the real nodus in the whole matter,
and have you any conclusion on this head different from his ?
" He who desires to investigate only the hidden things of nature, which are
innumerable, with difficulty discovers a single one, and in the course of his in
vestigation is liable to fall into many errors, as experience teaches ; and how
much more likely is this to be the case, in investigating the hidden things of
spiritual and celestial life, where myriads of mysteries exist for one that is to be
found in invisible nature ! For the sake of illustimting this point, let us take the
following instance ; man of himself cannot do otherwise than commit evil, and
turn himself away from the Lord ; yet it is not man who does this, but the evil
spirits who are attendant on him ; nor do the evil spirits do
it,
but the evil itself
which they have appropriated to themselves
;
nevertheless man does evil, and
turns himself away from the Lord, and
is
in fault; and yet he does not live
but from the Lord. So on the other hand, man of himself cannot possibly do
good, and turn himself to the Lord, but by the angels
;
nor can the angels do this,
but the Lord alone
;
and yet man may as of himself do good, and turn himself
to the Lord
:
that this
is
really the case, neither the senses, nor science, nor phi
losophy can conceive, or apprehend, and therefore
if
they are consulted as to
the truth of such propositions, they reject and deny them, when nevertheless in
themselves they are most true
;
and thus
it
is
also in all other cases respecting
things spiritual and celestial."— .4. C. 233.
The grand problems connected with this subject do undoubtedly resolve them
selves at last into the mystery
of
dependent life, and although Swedenborg's dis
closures lay open
a
world of wisdom on this theme,
I
cannot now enlarge upon
it. If, however, you will take any of his Indexes and turning to the article Life,
consult the references,
I
shall be greatly mistaken
if
you do not find there a
depth of philosophy on that matter such as you have never met elsewhere.
VI. Predestination. —" The doctrine of predestination, as held by the Reformed
Churches,
is
clearly demonstrable by reason, and
is
fully taught in the Scriptures,
particularly in that part of the New Testament which Swedenborg discards.
This doctrine both he and his angels grossly misrepresent, much in the manner of
Tomline and Whitby, and the most violent cavillers among the Unitarians and
Arminians. According to him,
it
implies that we have no agency in spiritual
things; that man
is
like
a
stock, and
is
converted as inanimate, and that after
wards he does not know whether he be a stock vivified by grace, or not." Per
mit me here to remark, that the advocates of Swedenborg's doctrines are often
thrown by their opponents into a position which
is
embarrassing because
it
is
in fact a.false position —one to which they are reduced solely by the most unjust
arts of controversy. They are called upon to defend a system which

charged
with contravening certain doctrines that are claimed to be the doctrines taught
by the Reformers and held by what are termed evangelical churches. Still no

is
made to any authentic standard of these doctrines. We are nowhere

instructed as to what is the genuine and accredited form in which they are pro
pounded —no affirmative statement is given of the sense in which the tenet is, or
is not, to be understood by its espousers. In a word, we are left in the dark as to
what the real doctrine is which is said to be impugned by the contrary doctrine
of Swedenborg. If we turn to the Westminster Confession or Catechism, or any
one of the established formularies of faith, we are met upon the threshold by
the reply that that is not the form of the doctrine which the objector holds him
self pledged to defend. And so let us seek it where we will, it still eludes our
grasp. It assumes a thousand Protean forms. Our enemy does not meet us in
the open field or in his own proper person, but hurls his missiles from behind
the trees. We know not where to look for him. In the mean time the vague
general charge is producing its effect in creating odium. The honest and simple-
minded reader is horrified at the idea of the venerable dogmas of his church
being rudely assailed, not dreaming probably that these very dogmas have been
again and again called in question by multitudes who yet profess to receive
them, but who feel at liberty to interpret them in a sense quite different from
that which they bear on their face.
Thus in regard to the present point —that of predestination, hy which I suppose
you intend what is generally understood by the doctrine of the divine sovereignty
in the salvation of men. You leave me wholly unresolved as to what you un
derstand to be the genuine doctrine of the Word on that subject, or where I am
to seek for an accredited exposition of it. There is a tremendous heresy some
where, but what it is I am left to guess. You virtually charge Swedenborg with
misrepresenting the doctrine, because " according to him it implies, that we
have no agency in spiritual things ; that man is like a stock, and is converted
as inanimate." Now I must confess for myself, that, taking the tenet as it
seems generally to be apprehended and set forth, I am unable to see why the
implication alleged is not well founded, with the abatement that by " no agency
in spiritual things" is to be fairly understood no active agency in the particular
matter of which he is treating —the conversion of the soul to God. If I under
stand the commonly received doctrine it is, that God, for infinitely wise reasons
existing in his own mind, determined from eternity, by a decree of election, to
save a certain specific number of the human race in virtue of the atoning work
of Christ, and that too wholly irrespective of their own prior merits or demerits ;
and in this consists essentially the sovereignty of the saving purpose. These
persons are brought successively into being, and by the peculiar orderings of
Divine Providence are brought under a system of means and influences, which,
though well adapted in their own nature to work efficaciously on their hearts
and to result in their renewal, are yet in themselves powerless to produce that
issue without the special putting forth of an act of the divine power, which shall
quicken them from the death of trespasses and sins into newness of life. This
is held to be an instantaneous act, though usually, perhaps always, preceded by
a series of mental exercises, more or less distressing, termed convictions, but
which have not in their own nature any intrinsic efficacy to work the requisite
change, and to translate the soul from darkness into light. In this emergency
the Omnipotence of grace interposes, and, in compliance with the eternal decree
of election, by the infusion of a principle of divine life enables the trembling
sinner to avail himself of the provided remedy and to believe to the saving of

his soul. In all this process there is indeed involved the agency of truth as an
instrumental means to the designed end ; but still in the very act and article of
being bora again the soul is necessarily passive, and believes and loves sim
ply because it is enabled to do so in consequence of the present transforming in
fluence of the Holy Spirit which makes the man a new creature in Christ Jesus.
In virtue of this process all boasting on the part of man is excluded, and a ground
laid for the ascription of all the glory of his salvation to the gratuitous mercy of
God in Christ Jesus, and the top stone in the fabric of his praise, is laid with
crying, " Grace, grace, unto it."
This, I believe, is a fair exhibition of the orthodox doctrine on this head, and
I am wholly at a loss to perceive in what respect injustice is done to it by the
use of language implying the utmost degree of passivity in the subject at the mo
ment of the transition, and this moment.is the hinge on which his eternal destiny
turns. The doctrine certainly holds that the sinner, up to the instant of the
change, is spiritually dead, and from the instant of the change, is spiritually
alive ; there can be, on this view, no medium between death and life. The
change too is wrought by a power entirely ah extra to the soul itself. It is the
direct act of Omnipotence. Must not the soul, then, be passive in the true re
generating process ? Regeneration is on this view re-birth, and what active agency
has the soul in this process more than the infant has in the process of natural birth ?
I am well aware of the various refinements which theologians have spun and
woven in regard to this subject, and by which they would fain escape the con
clusion of this entire and absolute passivity in the act of the soul's being bom
again, but " to this complexion it comes at last." If the subject of the work is
at one moment spiritually dead, and the next spiritually alive, and the quicken-
ing has been effected by the power of God and not by the free agency of man,
then I would respectfully inquire in what particular Swedenborg has misrepre
sented the doctrine, when he says that man in this matter is " like a stock and
is converted as inanimate ?" The question, you will observe, is not whether the
doctrine is theologically true or false. It is simply whether he has given an
unfair and distorted account of it. Of this let the candid and intelligent judge. I
have very little doubt as to the verdict. The point is so palpably obvious in
itself, that the infusion of divine life into a soul spiritually dead is effected with
out any real co-operation on the part of the subject, that there is no possibility
of questioning
it,
nor do
I
anticipate from yourself the least gainsaying on this
head. On the contrary, what
I
anticipate
is
the direct interrogatory, "
If
the fact
be not so, how
is
it
?

is
man's regeneration owing

not to the mighty

accomplishment of
a
previous purpose to that effect, or, in other words, in conse
quence of an eternal decree of election, which
is
but another name for the doc
trine of predestination ?"
This
is
a fair question, and though my contracted limits will prevent my doing
any but a very partial justice to the subject,
I
will still endeavor to present Swe-
denborg's teachings on this point in such a light that, whether or not they shall
carry with them
a
constraining evidence of truth, they shall at least appear in
very marked contrast with the established tenet, and may possibly also produce
the conviction that what he says of the internal state of the members of the Synod
of Dort
is
not so very far from the truth.

REPLY TO DR. WOODS. 156
And first as to Predestination ,- so far as this doctrine coincides with the doctrine
of a universal Providence acting by specific means, in accordance with the moral
freedom of creatures, and with a view to eternal ends of Love and Mercy, Swe-
denborg instead of rejecting, unequivocally asserts
it,
and his elaborate treatise
on " Divine Providence," of which you speak respectfully, abounds in illustra
tions of it. But so far as the term
is
employed in a technical theological sense,
implying the selection, by
a
fixed and arbitrary decree, of a certain portion of the
human race, as the subjects of salvation to the exclusion or preterition of the
rest, he does indeed most emphatically discard
it,
as
I
think every one will who
allows himself to reflect calmly upon the subject, and who ventures to ask him
self the question, whether he can conceive the possibility of the existence, in the
Divine mind, of any reasons consistent with his perfections, which should have
dictated the purpose to save a part of a fallen race on the bare ground of elec
tion, when they were all in precisely the same circumstances, and the value of one
soul, in view of its stupendous destiny, as great as that of another.
I
am unable
to perceive, for myself, any possible way of reconciling this with the prompt
ings which would naturally move the infinite Benevolence, on the same princi
ples on which
it
could determine to save a part, to save the whole. By the
very supposition, there could be no greater intrinsic obstacle to be overcome in
the recovery of the whole than in that of a part. Why then should not the pur
pose of salvation comprise the whole
?
The opposite view involves the neces
sity of ascribing to the Most High a partiality which, on the ground assumed,
is
wholly repugnant, not only to our instinctive, but to our most enlightened, notions
of the divine attributes.
I
canuot, of course, be ignorant of the reply which will naturally be made to
this, viz. that inasmuch as the fact
is
indisputable that a part only of the race
are saved, and as they are saved by omnipotent grace, which cannot be sup
posed to act without a previous purpose, we are therefore shut up to the conclu
sion of such
a
purpose, and this purpose can only be regarded as eternal, and
if
eternal, therefore sovereign. To this
I
answer, that the proposed solution of
the problem inevitably necessitates the consequence, that man
is
absolutely pas
sive in the turning point from death to life, as much so as a stock or a statue, and
therefore what Swedenborg has said of the doctrine in that respect
is
demon
stratively confirmed. Are you willing to admit this? But suppose a man to be
saved on this principle— suppose he finds himself in heaven, as heaven
is
com
monly conceived, in virtue solely of a sovereign act of grace—though he may
be constrained to acknowledge a discriminating mercy in his own happy lot, yet
will
it
be no diminution of his bliss to think that he
is
there, while thousands of
others, of equal claims with himself— that is, of none at all—are left to perish
?
With his mind enlarged to apprehend more fully the genius of the divine coun
sels which have secured his salvation, will not the thought that this amazing
weight of glory
is
the result of a purely arbitrary decree of Jehovah send an
inward chill upon the fervor of his grateful praise
?
Can the highest raptures
imparted by the effluence of the divine Love to his soul, obscure his perceptions
of the demands of the divine Wisdom, or blind him to the fact that that Love has
wrought its issues in his behalf at the expense of Wisdom
?
For what idea can
he have of
a
Wisdom which does not act from adequate Reasons
?

Reasons can he assign to himself for his being in heaven while so many othew

though no more hell-deserving than himself, are yet in hell ? Can he help see
ing that it is in consequence solely of an arbitrary decree ? And will not an
inward shudder come over him at the bare thought of a God of infinite perfec
tions being prompted by nothing higher than mere arbitrary motives to any
action whatever ? Would not such a conclusion mar the life of all his joys ?
Must not infinite Excellence suffer in his esteem ? That he is made the benefi
ciary of this electing grace—that this astounding favoritism is made to redound
to his advantage —will not of itself relieve his mind as to the overwhelming prob
lem involved in the mode of its being conferred upon him. Neither will the
assurance that no injustice has been done to the lost silence, the irrepressible voice
of his bosom in view of the unmeasured diversity in their lot and his. His illu
minated reason will never cease to demand why the same justice that has been
meted out to them has not been awarded to him also ; and the assertion of a
mere design to illustrate the Divine Sovereignty —to show forth the simple good
pleasure of the Most High —will be far from satisfying him. He can conceive of
no object to be gained by the simple display of sovereignty, though the sovereign
ty of a God, which will be sufficient to countervail the disparagement that must,
from such a source, accrue to his general attributes.
The only rejoinder which I can conceive as being made to this is, that such a
procedure on the part of God, cannot properly be termed arbitrary, since, although
we may be unable to apprehend them, yet we must necessarily take for grant
ed the fact of some adequate reasons existing in the Divine mind as the basis of
its determinations. But this is the very point in debate. I contend that the
human mind cannot conceive the possibility of any other reason than the bare
display of sovereignty. That is to say, that God resolves to make one to differ from
another in respect to his eternal destiny simply to show that he can make him
to differ. And how unlike is this to the case of a man who, with a chess-board
before him, touches one of the squares rather than another, merely in order to
evince the fact that he can touch any one of them that he pleases ? If this is
not the doctrine, what is it ? What else is assigned, as the ground of election
than the design to show that God may do what he will with his own ? Is it
affirmed that he may have other motives which he has not seen fit to reveal ?
If so, I ask where this is taught ? Do the Scriptures declare anything of the
kind ? Do they give the slightest intimation that the salvation of a human soul
is owing to anything else than the pure self-moving love of the infinitely benig
nant Jehovah, who is moved to goodness for goodness' sake, and who must,
from the necessity of his nature, be as kindly affected towards one of his crea
tures as towards another, provided their moral position in regard to Him is the
same ? What possible reasons then can be, for one moment, imagined in the
Divine mind on which to found a decree of election ? We admit not the charge
of presumption in such a sentence. While we do not assume to fathom the
depths of the Infinite Wisdom, there are some conclusions which we hesitate
not to affirm respecting them, because they grow directly out of the clearest in
tuitions of the intellect of man as constituted by its Maker ; and this is one, that
there could not possibly be any other than arbitrary reasons, which should dic
tate the salvation of Paul in preference to that of Judas, when both are previously
supposed to be in precisely the same circumstances. The same promptings which
would embrace one in a saving purpose must necessarily embrace the other.

REPLY TO DR. WOODS. 157
But are all saved? Certainly not; but the reason why they are not is the
farthest possible from any absolute or sovereign decree securing the salvation
of one and pretermitting another. The boundless benevolence of the Deity pre
destinates all to heaven by the very fact of having provided a redemption which
is available to all, but the scheme of this redemption is such as has respect to the
moral freedom of its subjects. It must be voluntarily accepted and appropriated,
inasmuch as this very appropriation is the grand constituent element of heaven.
There neither is nor can be any other heaven than what consists in the right
moral state of the inner man. Such a state can now be restored to man in con
sequence of what the Lord has done as Mediator, but the restoration can never
be effected on any scheme which involves the suspension, for a single instant,
of his entire freedom as a moral agent. His own active co-operation is impera
tively requisite in every stage of the progress of his regeneration, or in other
words, of his salvation, because the very essence of this salvation is in the state
and actings of his will. To the question how the progress can begin at all, on
Swedenborg's principles, when man is by nature, as he teaches, altogether evil
and averse to God and goodness, and unable to originate volitions directly
contrary to his ruling love, I reply, that it is essential to his freedom that he
should have the power of compelling himself to abstinence from particular acts of
evil, and of shunning them as sins against God, and when he does this there
follows not merely the negation of so much evil, but the inflowing of so much
positive good from the Divine fountain of good, which is like the light of the
sun that is ever pressing for entrance into the least crevice or opening that will
allow it to penetrate. " The life of love and charity," says Swedenborg, " opena
the interior mind by the influx of light from heaven, the life of love and charity
being the divine life itself; for the Lord loves everyone and does good to every
one from love ; wherefore when that life is received, then the Lord is present,
and is conjoined to the recipient, consequently he flows into his superior mind,
which is called the spiritual mind, and by light from himself opens it." Every
influx of this nature, though perhaps inappreciably slight at first, does something
towards weakening the reigning power of evil, and communicating strength to
resist its further encroachments. Every act of self-compulsion of this kind opens
the way for fresh supplies of the Divine Love and Life to flow in, whereby the
soul becomes more and more re-inforced by heavenly impulses and tendencies,
and voluntary action in the right direction more easy and habitual. This we re
gard as the usual commencing process of regeneration, which far from being
an instantaneous, is an everlasting act. The true Christian is for ever regenerat
ing; that is, becoming more and more conformed and conjoined to the Lord.
The process of the work is never, indeed, entirely uniform and equable. It pro
ceeds by alternations and crises—by temptations and combats —by advances
and recessions —but the course is on the whole onward, and the believer's re
moval to heaven is but one stage in this course, for he has here entered upon
his true immortal life, and heaven, as a state, is but the normal form of its devel
opment. " The common idea," says Mr. Clissold, " with regard to Regeneration,
is, that it signifies re-birth, or being born again, and that, as a man can be natu
rally born but once, so he can be spiritually born but once ; the consequence is,
that Regeneration, whether supposed to take place at baptism, or in subsequent
life, is considered to be a simple or single act, '
incapable of latitude or increase.'

158 REPLY TO DR. WOODS.
This error arises, as we conceive, like all others in theology, from a spiritual truth
being naturalized, or degraded to the level of the merely natural mind. For,
though a man can be born but once naturally, and hence also naturally can die
but once ; yet, because the body can die but once, it does not hence follow that
the soul can die but once. The life of the natural body is but of one nature,
which never ascends beyond that which it originally was ; it can never be ele
vated out of itself into a life of a higher order, for animal or corporeal life is but
one, and hence the body is but once born, comes to but one perfection, and dies
but one death. The case is altogether different with the life of the spirit, which,
while we are living in this world, may be elevated out of its plane or level, into
another that is higher, and this unceasingly. Every sinful habit to which the
soul dies is the occasion of a distinct death ; and it may have to die as many
deaths as it has sins unto which it must die. The same is true with regard to
the evils inherited by birth before they descend into ultimate acts. As every
evil has its own life in the soul, so also, in being destroyed, it must undergo its
own death; hence the soul may die daily; and as it may die daily, so, in a
corresponding sense, it may be said to be born daily ; hence, as there may be a
perpetual death, so may there be also a perpetual birth, hence a perpetual gene
ration, and hence a perpetual regeneration. This state of generation and regen
eration is the eternal spring of the soul ; and hence we see the true reason for
which, to angelic beings, heaven is a season of perpetual spring. Besides, it is
to be remembered, that we cannot but affix to the term regeneration a sense
more enlarged than the one it commonly bears, and which appears to be its
more immediate sense ; for, properly speaking, it does not signify re-birth, but
re-generation, re-begetting, or re-production. Now, as all the processes of growth
which take place in a plant or animal, may be said to be the processes of gen
eration, in the more enlarged sense of that term, so every progression of the soul
in spiritual life, we consider to be a process of generation ; hence spiritual af
fections and thoughts are the result of spiritual generation, and the way to purify
or exalt their nature is by a perpetual process of regeneration. This is no merely
speculative or metaphysical doctrine, for it necessarily originates this practical
truth, that evil is not removed from the soul in an instant, as filth is washed
from the body ; evil can be removed only by a death, and good can be received
only by its being generated within us ; hence there is no such thing as right
eousness being imputed without being imparted, and the popular doctrine ofJusti
fication by Faith, is one which we consider to be contrary to God's Word, and
contradictory to the real nature and constitution of things." — Clissold's Letter, p 48.
In following the regenerate soul ideally onward to the consummation of its
bliss in the heavenly mansions, I have asked myself again and again what is lost
or lacking to
it,
as a ground of thanksgiving and praise, on the view now pre
sented.
Is
not the man saved by grace
?
Is he not raised to angelic beatitude
solely in consequence of the gracious, unbought, unsought intervention of the
Divine love and mercy in his behalf? Must he not otherwise have perished in
his iniquities
?
Will his golden harp send forth one note less to swell the sym
phony of heaven, that he has been saved, not by an arbitrary act of mercy, but
by
a
method perfectly in accordance both with the highest attributes of his
Maker and with the constituent principles of his own nature—
a
method which
has left his freedom inviolate and the perfections of the Deity unimpeached
?

Nothing, meantime, is involved in the scheme now presented which derogates
at all from the prescience and the true predestination of Jehovah. In the nature
of the case he foreknow the moral history of every individual of the race, and
the issue of every event, but he foreordains or decrees only his own acts, and not
the volitions of his creatures, as this would bring him into immediate concur
rence with voluntary acts opposed to his own will and which he has expressly
forbidden.
Such then is the ground on which you charge the system of Swedenborg with
misrepresenting and denying the received doctrine of Predestination. I do not
admit that he has misrepresented it and if he has not, he ought, I conceive, to
deny it, as all his adherents most unequivocally do. Still, we will reconsider
our ground whenever you or any one else will show us adequate cause.
VII. The Resurrection of the Body. —" Swedenborg rejects the common doctrine
of the resurrection. The Scriptures represent the resurrection of all who have
died as a future event ; and they describe the manner in which they will be raised,
and the great change which will be made in the resurrection body, and the cor
responding change which will be made in those who will be alive at that time.
But our author denies such a resurrection, and with some false teachers men
tioned by the Apostle, holds, that the resurrection of all who have died, '
is al
ready past.' Death aud resurrection take place, he says, at or near the same
time. This he learnt partly, it seems, from philosophical reasoning, as Profes
sor Bush did, and partly from the conversation of angels. But philosophical
reasoning is by no means infallible ; and Swedenborg's angels were only dead
men, who often betrayed their ignorance, and committed many mistakes, and
did not pretend to be divinely inspired, and sometimes needed and received in
formation from Swedenborg. Both he and his followers are exceedingly con
fident in their denial of the future resurrection of the body, though this has been
believed by the Christian Church from the days of the Apostles to the present
time."
This is a point which I shall not attempt to argue. I have already dwelt some
what upon it in a previous letter, and have through various other channels pre
sented my own and Swedenborg's views with sufficient distinctness to the pub
lic. I content myself with simply offering one or two additional paragraphs in
opposition to the current doctrine, leaving it to the reader to judge which theory
carries with it'the most constraining evidence of truth. As to the alleged falli
bility of philosophical reasoning, so far as it implies that the results of that rea
soning are not always sound, I have no disposition to dispute with you : but I ven
ture to make the same assertion respecting Scriptural interpretation. It does not
strike me that even a tenet which " has been believed by the Christian Church
from the days of the Apostles to the present time" is necessarily infallible, nor
do I think any construction of the Sacred Oracles can be either infallible or cor
rect which conflicts with the results of just philosophical reasoning And as to
the mistakes and ignorance of " Swedenborg's angels," I shall be prompt to
admit them when they are pointed out. You seem frequently to lose sight of
the distinction which he continually makes between the angels of heaven and
the spirits of the world of spirits, who are in a far inferior degree of illumination.
I am not aware that Swedenborg anywhere represents the angels as needing or
receiving information from him. I should certainly think, however, that they did

and probably received it,
if
they taught that the doctrine of the resur
rection was the doctrine of the resurrection of the material body to be accom
plished at some future period. —But
I
yield my space to a higher authority.
"
Ihave discoursed with some'within afew days after their decease, and because
they were then recently come, they were in a light there, which differed little in
their sight from the light of the world. And because the light appeared such to
them, they doubted whether they had light from any other source, wherefore
they were taken into the first of heaven, where the light was still brighter, and
from thence speaking with me, they said, that they had never before seen such
a light
;
and this took place when the sun was already set. They then wondered
that spirits had eyes by which they saw, when yet they believed in the life of
the body, that the life of spirits was merely thought, and indeed abstractedly
without a subject, by reason that they had not been able to think of any subject
of thought, inasmuch as they had not seen any; and this being the case, they
had not then perceived otherwise, than that because
it
was mere thought alone,
it
was dissipated, together with the body in which
it
was, just as any aura or
any fire, unless
it
should miraculously be kept together and subsist from the Lord.
And they saw then how easily the learned fall into error concerning life after
death, and that they more than others do not believe except in things which
they see. Therefore they were surprised now, that they not only had thought,
but also sight, and likewise the other senses
;
and especially that they appear to
themselves altogether as men, that they mutually see and hear each other, con
verse together, feel their own members by the touch, and this more exquisitely
than in the life of the body. Hence they were amazed that man
is
altogether
ignorant of this, while he lives in the world
;
and they pitied the human race,
that they know nothing of such things, because they believe nothing, and more
especially they who are in superior light, namely, they who are within the
church, and have the Word. Some of them believed no otherwise, than that
men after death would be as ghosts, in which opinion they confirmed them
selves from the spectres of which they had heard
;
but hence they drew no
other conclusion, than that
it
was some gross vital principle, which
is
first ex
haled from the life of the body, but which again falls back to the dead body, and
is
thus extinguished. But some believed, that they were first to rise again at the
time of the last judgment, when the world was to perish, and then with the
body, which, though fallen into dust, would be then collected together, and thus
they would rise again with bone and flesh. And whereas mankind have in
vain for many ages expected that last
j
udgment or destruction of the world, they
have fallen into the error that they should never rise again
;
thinking nothing in
this case of that which they have learned from the Word, and from which they
have also sometimes so spoken, that when man dies, his soul
is
in the hand of
God, among the happy or unhappy according to the life which he had acquaint
ed himself with, and was become familiar to
;
neither of what the Lord said
concerning the rich man and Lazarus. But they were instructed, that every
one's last judgment
is
when he dies, and that then he appears to himself en
dowed with a body as in the world, and to enjoy every sense as in the world,
but more pure and exquisite, inasmuch as corporeal things do not hinder, and
those things which are of the light of the world do not overshadow those which
are of the light of heaven
;
thus that they are in a body as
it
were purified
;
and
that after death, the body cannot possibly partake of what
is
bony and fleshy
such as
it
had in the world, because this would be to be again encompassed
with earthly dust. With some
I
conversed on this subject on the same day that
their bodies were entombed; who saw through my eyes their own corpse, the
bier, and the ceremony of burial
;
and they said, that they reject that corpse, and
that
it
had served them for uses in the world in which they had been, and that
they live now in a body which serves them for uses in the world in which they
now are. They wished also, that
I
should tell this to their relations who were in
mourning
:
but
it
was given to reply, that

with their eyes, so spirits see each other with theirs, and that man cannot see
spirits unless with the eyes of his spirit, and that he then sees them when the
Lord opens the internal sight, as was done to the prophets, who saw spirits and
angels, and also many things of heaven. Whether they who live at this day
would have believed those things, if they had lived at that time, there is room
to doubt."— A. C. 4527.
VIII. Rejection of a Portion of the Scriptures. —" I must here notice again the
doctrine of Swedenborg respecting the Scriptures ; a doctrine which must be
regarded as of more consequence than almost any other. He excluded from the
word of God about one sixth part of the Old Testament, and about one half of
the New. The books he received as the word of God are those which he found
to have the internal or spiritual sense. He rejected so many of the books con
tained in our Scriptures, because he found them incapable of the internal sense
or senses. All parts of what he acknowledged to be the word of God, every
word, every letter, and every point had three senses, a natural sense, a spiritual
sense, and a celestial sense. Why those parts of Scripture which he rejected
were, in his judgment, incapable of the higher sense, more than some other parts,
we are not informed. * * *
The attempt of Swedenborg to propagate an
opinion concerning the Scriptures so contrary to the teachings of the New Tes
tament, is sufficient completely to undermine his authority, and to cast an air of
suspicion on all that he wrote."
The grounds of this accusation have already been considered. It will be un
necessary to re-adduce them. He exclxtdes nothing from the Scriptures in any
other way than by indicating the fact of an interior spiritual sense pertaining to
some books which he says does not attach to others ; and the reasons assigned for
this assertion I have already brought before you. If the present virtual charge
of garbling and mutilating the Word should ever be repeated, I hope it will not
be without bestowing some consideration upon the arguments urged in behalf
of his positions. I merely add an extract relative to the fact of a three- fold sense
which finds so little favor in your eyes and so little refutation in your logic.
" That there is an internal or spiritual sense in the Word, in its external or
natural sense, as a diamond in its matrix, or as a beautiful infant in its swad
dling clothes, is a truth which has heretofore been altogether unknown in the
Christian world, and hence also it is altogether unknown what is meant by the
Consummation of the Age, the Coming of the Lord, the Last Judgment, and by
the New Jerusalem, on which subjects many things are spoken and predicted in
the Word of each Testament, both Old and New. Without the unfolding and
unswathing of the literal sense of the Word by its spiritual sense, who can know
intellectually what is signified by the things which the Lord predicted in Mat
thew xxiv., and also in the Revelations, and in like manner in Daniel, and in the
Prophets, in many passages ? Make the experiment yourself, if you are so dis
posed, by reading those pages of the prophetical Word, which treat sometimes
of wild beasts and cattle, sometimes of forests and brakes, sometimes of valleys
and mountains, sometimes of bats, of ochim, tziim, satyrs, &c. &c. ; try whe
ther you can perceive any thing divine therein, unless you believe it to lie con
cealed inwardly, inasmuch as it was inspired of God, just as a diamond lies con
cealed in its matrix.
" To the above, I shall add somewhat new from the spiritual world. The
rulers of the church, who flock into that world after death, are first taught con
cerning the Sacred Scripture, as containing a spiritual sense, which in the world
was unknown to them, and they are also told, that the angels of heaven are in
that sense, whilst man is in the sense of the letter ; and further, that a transla
tion, or change, of the latter sense, into the former, is effected with man, whilst

he reads t'ie Word under holy influences, and that there is a kind of unfolding
or unswathing, somewhat like the breaking of the shell encompassing an
almond, and the casting away the shell, so that the naked almond passes into
heaven, and is received by the angels; and also like a seed cast into the earth,
and being there stripped of its outward coats, puts forth its germ. That seed is
the Word in the sense of the letter, and the germ theuce put forth is the spiritual
sense, and this latter passes to the angels, but the former rests with man ; still,
however, that seed remains tvith man in his mind, as in its ground, and in time
produces its germ, and fructifies it, if man, by the seeds of life, which are the
truths of faith, and the good things of charity, is conjoined with the Lord, and
thereby consociated with the angels." —Hob. Life of Swed. p. 159-161.
" The word, which is divine truth descends from the Lord through the heavens,
into the world, wherefore it is adapted to the wisdom of the angels who are in
the three heavens, and is also adapted to men who are in the natural world.
Hence also it is, that the Word in its first origin is altogether divine, afterwards
celestial, then spiritual, and lastly natural ; it is celestial for the angels of the
inmost or third heaven, who are called celestial angels, spiritual for the angels of
the second or middle heaven, who are called spiritual angels, and celestial and
spiritual-natural for the angels of the ultimate or first heaven, who are called
celestial and spiritual-natural angels, and natural for men in the world, for men, so
long as they live in the material body, think and speak naturally ; hence then it
is, that the Word is given with the angels of each heaven, but with a difference
according to the degree of their wisdom, intelligence, and science ; and although
it differs as to the sense in each heaven, still it is the same Word. The Divine
principle itself, which is in the Word from the Lord, when it descends to the
inmost or third heaven, becomes divine celestial, when it thence descends to the
middle or second heaven, it becomes divine spiritual, and when from this heaven
it descends to the ultimate or first, it becomes divine celestial, or spiritual natu
ral, and lastly, when it thence descends into the world, it becomes a divine
natural Word, such as it is with us in the letter: these successive derivations of
the divine truth proceeding from the Lord himself, exist by virtue of correspon
dences established from creation itself between things superior and inferior, con
cerning which, the Lord willing, more will be said hereafter. The reasou why
all strength, and all power are in the ultimates of divine truth, thus in the natu
ral sense of the Word, which is the sense of the letter, is, because this sense is
the continent of all the interior senses, viz. of the spiritual and celestial, spoken
of above ; and since it is the continent, it is also the basis, and in the basis lies
all strength ; for if things superior do not rest upon their basis, they fall down
and are dissolved, as would be the case with the spiritual and celestial things of
the Word if they did not rest upon the natural and literal sense, for this not only
sustains the interior senses, but also contains them, wherefore the Word or di
vine truth, in this sense, is not only in its power, but also in its fulness. From
these considerations, it also follows, that the all of the doctrine of the church
ought to be confirmed from the literal sense of the Word, and that all the power
of doctrine is thence derived." —A. E. 593.
Take the Scriptures, as we have them, in the literal sense, and trace them
back to their original source in the mind of the Deity, and you are brought to the
very primary element of which they consist, viz. Love and Wisdom, or in other
words, Affection and Intellect. That is to say, they resolve themselves into the
essential nature of their Author, with whom there can be no Truth but it is vivi
fied and pervaded by its appropriate Good. The Truth therefore that is to us
embodied in the written oracles must previously have existed in his own mind
independent of human language, and supposing that Truth to go forth from
him, or to descend to the spheres of created intelligences intermediate between
himself and man, it must utter itself of course in the form of thought independ
ent of vocal speech or written language ; for there are no books of paper or
parchment in the heavens. The divine communications as they flow down

ward must first be published in the interiors of the spirits who receive them, and
if you suppose an order of spirits who stand nearer to the Most High than others
by reason of their being more deeply imbued with affection or good, ihey will natu
rally, from their predominant state, receive most readily that element of the de
scending Word which is kindred with the ruling element of their own nature,
or the principle of good, which has relation to uses and ends, the distinguishing
character of the highest or celestial degree. In this we see the basis laid for the
celestial sense of the Word. It is the sense which has respect to the affection that
necessarily enters in as the life and soul of all thought. In this sense are the
celestial angels by the very constitution of their nature. But the Divine Word
in its descent, meets with another order of beings, who, though partakers of good
are yet more distinguished for wisdom, and therefore are not so much in ends as
in causes, which are intrinsically secondary to ends. To them also the Word, in
its progress, accommodates itself, according to the dominant principle of their
nature, and the sense which yields an appropriate pabulum to them is the spirit
ual, as they are in the spiritual degree, which is the degree of causes. We are still,
however, as yet above the region of language and written speed}, because above
the sphere of nature, or that of effects. Following the Word downward to this
sphere we see it coming into ultimates by clothing itself in human language and
yielding what is termed a literal sense, a sense accommodated to those who, as
living in the flesh on earth, are in the ultimates of nature, where the causes operat
ing from the spiritual sphere produce their effects.
Thus then we have the philosophy of the three senses of the Word, founded
upon a threefold distinction in the orders of intelligent beings, and in close affinity
with Swedenborg's sublime doctrine of degrees, the importance of which as a key to
all sound knowledge in every department of the universe, the world has yet to
learn. In view of the explanation now given I do not see why I am not entitled
to pronounce the grand problem solved as to the grounds of his assertions respect
ing the existence of this threefold sense. Must not the fact necessarily be as he as
serts ? Is not the principle virtually to be recognized in the very book, the product
of your own mind, which I am now reviewing ? Were you not prompted, in the
first instance, by an end of affection to the inditing of the volume ? Your supreme
regard to what you deem the truth of God —your love for the souls of your fellow-
men —your anxiety to guard them from the inroads of error— were undoubtedly
your moving impulse ; and thus far you were in the sphere of ends. This im-
pulse,however.you can easily perceive, is something superior, or rather interior,
to thought. By it your thought or understanding was excited to put forth its ac
tivity and institute a course of mental reasoning designed to bear upon the ap
prehended errors and fallacies of the system that you would expose. In doing
this you were operating in the sphere of causes. But your purpose was still tack
ing completion. In order to the attainment of the end the cause must pass into
effect, and this could only be done by the writing and publishing of the book. In
this act your love and wisdom really descend into ultimates and assume a natural
form, and in this form the end, cause, and effect actually co-exist together and man
ifest the fulness of their power. How pertinently this illustrates Swedenborg's
doctrine of the Divine Word you can scarcely fail to see, nor will you refuse to
admit that it is at least somewhat curious, that the very principles on which your
book is constructed —a book written, in great measure, to expose the falsities of

Swedenborg's positions respecting the nature of God's Book —afford all but a
downright demonstration of his truth.
As to what you say of Swedenborg's " authority being undermined" in con
sequence of what he has affirmed respecting the Scriptures, I would simply re
mark, that as he neither claims for himself, nor his adherents for him, any other
authority than that which is essentially inherent in the truths that he proclaims,
go that authority can be " undermined" by nothing else than a demonstration-
-that those asserted truths are in fact fallacies and falsities. This, I venture to
*say, has not yet been done, nor do I see any immediate prospect of its being
done.
IX. The Corruption and Desolation of the Old Church and the Purity and Perfection
of the New. —" Swedenborg maintains that, unless the New Jerusalem Church had
been established, no flesh could have been saved ; that the Protestant Church as
well as the Catholic, was universally corrupt, and destitute of the faith and
charity which are essential to salvation. He says, so long as the dragon and
his crew continue in the world of spirits, no divine truth, united to divine good,
can pass through to the men of the earth without being perverted or destroyed.
And by the dragon, he says, are meant those who are in the faith of the present
church. According to his teaching, all the best men of the Reformed Church, the
Luthers,the Melanchthons, the Calvins, —all that suffered martyrdom for their
attachment to Christ in different countries, —all the Leightons, and Baxters, and
Scotts, and Wilberforces, and Howards, and Martyns of Great Britain, —all the
Hookers, and Mathers, the Edwardses and Brainerds and Paysons of America,
belonging to the dragon and his crew. And he often expresses it as his judg
ment, that none, except those who constitute the New Church, have any knowl
edge of the true spiritual sense of the word of God, or any title to the blessings
of the gospel. All except the few who belong to the Swedenborgian church,
are in darkness. The disciples of Swedenborg are in the truths of faith which
are from the goods of charity ; but the rest are in falses, because in the use of
their free will, they have opened their interiors to the influx of evil spirits." —f.
130.
There is in all this a strange mixture of truth and error, by which the reader
is sadly mystified and misled. That there was 'a necessity for the establishment
of the New Jerusalem Church is indeed affirmed by Swedenborg, because God
had expressly announced it in Isaiah and the Apocalypse, and his counsel must
stand of course. The fact of the ushering in of such a dispensation at some time
you cannot, as a believer in Revelation, question. But you may be less ready to
admit the identity of the New Jerusalem of John with that of Swedenborg, and
on this head I cannot enter into a full discussion till I learn that you have satis
factorily acquainted yourself with the fundamental grounds on which he affirms
this identity, and are prepared to give your reasons, as an interpreter of Scrip
ture, for denying it. He has given the most abundant reasons for his assertion,
and among them is undoubtedly the alleged fact, that at the period when this
dispensation commenced (about the middle of the last century), the pre-exist
ing Christian church, both Catholic and Protestant had lapsed into a deep and
wide-spread degeneracy in consequence of the prevalent tenets of a Trinity of
Persons in the Godhead —of an Atonement effected by a vicariovt substitution of

the innocent for the guilty —and by the separation of Charity and Faith in the
matter of Justification, all which enter into the very vitals of Christian Doctrine
and Life, and an erroneous view of which must necessarily corrupt and devas
tate the Church. The question becomes, as you will perceive, in the first
instance, a simple question of fact—have these doctrines been generally taught
under the aspect in which I have presented them, and then, secondly, are they
under this aspect true ? If not, they must assuredly be pernicious, and I do not
think it an easy matter to overstate their mischievous and ruinous effects. That
they are not true— that they are pre-eminently untrue —it has been the drift of
my previous reasoning to evince —with what success I leave it to yourself and
others to judge.
But we are pressed by the consequences. If the doctrines held and taught by
such men as Leighton, Baxter, Scott, Edwards, Brainerd, Payson, and others of
similar stamp, really involved grand and essential errors, do we not, by the very
force of the allegation, pronounce sentence upon the men, and cut them off from
all hope of heaven ? Do we not consign them over to a fatal fellowship with " the
dragon and his crew ?" No other inference could well be drawn from the above
presentation of the subject, and yet no inference could be more unjust and inju
rious io our author and to the true character of his system. Not the least strik
ing among its wonderful features is that of the enlarged and catholic Charity
which it breathes towards every degree of real good, with whatever error of
understanding it is found in conjunction. The fundamental distinction upon
which it every where insists between the love or life principle and the mere intel
lectual conviction of truth, upon the former of which and not upon the latter,
salvation is suspended, enables him to recognize the heirs of eternal life in mul
titudes of those whose doctrinal belief is widely at variance with that which he
inculcates. Indeed I have often been deeply and admiringly impressed by the
tender solicitude he evinces so to discriminate between the falsities of the head
and the heart as to embrace as many as possible within the range of the Lord's
saving goodness. Nothing approaching to a spirit of stern and gloomy denun
ciation is to be found in his writings. It is only when falsities are intelligently
confirmed and thence wrought into the texture of the life, that he despairs of a
happy result. And it would certainly be strange if one who assures us that even
the well-disposed heathen, who lives up to the light of his convictions, is saved
as far as his goodness and truth will admit, should still exclude from the pros
pect of heaven such men as the pious worthies whose names you have recited.
That their faith was at fault so far as it coincided with the leading popular dog
mas upon which I have dwelt, is undoubtedly true, but you will see from the
extracts which follow that their errors might still consist with a salvable state,
though they must necessarily detract from that completeness and symmetry of
character, which results from the fair and full conjunction of Goodness and
Truth.
_" The subject here treated of is those who are saved, although from the doc
trine of their religion they were in falsities ; for all are saved who are in the good
of life according to the dogmas of their religion, which they believed to be truths,
although they were not truths, for what is false is not imputed to any one who
lives well according to the dogmas of his religion ; for the good of life according
to religion contains within itself the affection of knowing truths which such per

remains with man after death, and especially the affection of knowing truths, be
cause this is a spiritual affection, and every man when he becomes a spirit is his
own affection, of consequence, the truths which they desire they then imbibe,
and so receive them deeply in their hearts." —A. E. 455.
" Inasmuch as they lived in love to God and in charity towards their neighbor,
the falsities of their religion were accepted by the Lord as truths, because in
wardly in their falsities there was the good of love, and the good of love quali
fies all truth, and in such case qualifies the falsity which is believed by such to
be truth ; the good also, which lies concealed within, causes such, when they
come into the other life, to perceive genuine truths, and to receive them. More
over there are truths which are only appearances of truth, such as are those of
the literal sense of the Word, which are also accepted by the Lord as genuine
truths when there is in them the good of love to the Lord, and the good of love
towards the neighbor, or charity ; in the other life also the good which is in
wardly hid with them dissipates the appearances, and makes bare the spiritual
or genuine truths." —A. E. 625.
" They within the Church are in falses and at the same time in good, who are
in heresies and in the life of good, and all out of the Church [are in falses and at
the same time in good] who are in good ; but falses with these do not damn,
unless they be such falses as are contrary to good, and destroy the very life of
good; but the falses which are not contrary to good, in themselves indeed are
falses, but in respect to the good of life, which they are not contrary to, they
almost put off the quality of the false, which is effected by application to good ;
for such falses can be applied to good, and be applied to evil ; if they are ap
plied to good, they become mild, but if to evil, they become hard; for falses can
equally be applied to good, as truths to evil, for truths of every kind by applica
tions to evil are falsified : to illustrate this by an example ; it is said that faith
alone saves, which in itself is false, especially with the evil, who thereby ex
clude the good of charity, as if it contributed nothing at all to salvation; but this
false grows mild with those who are in the good of life, for they apply it to good,
saying that faith alone saves, but that is not faith unless together with its fruit,
consequently unless where good is; so in other cases."—A. C. 8311.
"The fifth cause that they who in doctrine and life confirm with themselves
that faith produces good works as a tree does fruit, do not shut heaven against
themselves, is, because they do not falsify the Word, like those who believe in
justification and salvation by faith without good works ; for they who believe in
faith as justifying without good works, falsify all those parts of the Word where
love, charity, goods, works, deeds, working and doing, are mentioned and com
manded, and this even to the destruction of divine truth in the heavens, under
standing by those expressions either faith, or the moral and civil goods of the
world, or that they are said only for the vulgar, on account of the simplicity of
their faith; thus destroying divine truth itself by argumentations drawn from the
impotency of man to fulfil the law, from the nature of the good which is done
by man, as not being good, and the merit which is inherent in such good : but
they who in simplicity adjoin good works to faith, do not falsify those parts
of the Word, and hence do not remove faith from love to God, and thereby admit
the divine operation in everything which man is to do, as well as in everything
which he is to believe ? for they think and say that good works are to be done
as from man, inasmuch as he who does not act and believe as of himself,
believes and does nothing, and can have no religion ; but still, inasmuch as they
are not in genuine truths, though they do not indeed shut heaven against them
selves, they cannot advance further than to the threshold of heaven : howbeit to
such of them as have loved truths for the sake of truths, heaven is opened when
the divine order is restored with them, which is when charity and its good is in
the first place, and faith and its truth in the second, for they are then Tike those
who go on in a straight way with the face looking forward, whereas before they
were like those who go with the face looking backward." —A. E. 798.

this head going to show under what circumstances falsifications may be made
of the truths of the Word which still do not proceed to the extreme of closing
heaven against their authors. So also in the following list of references to the
" Arcana," by Swedenborg himself, you will see that he has given large consider
ation to the subject.
" That there are falsities of religion which agree with good, and falsities which
disagree, n. 9259 ; that falsities of religion, if they do not disagree with good, do
not produce evil, except with those who are in evil, n. 8318 ; that falsities of reli
gion are not imputed to those who are in good, but to those who are in evil, n.
8051, 8149 ; that truths not genuine, and also falsities may be consociated with
genuine truths with those who are in good, but not with those who are in evil,
n. 3470, 3471, 4551, 4552, 7344, 8149, 9298 ; that falsities and truths are consoci
ated by appearances from the literal sense of the Word, n. 7344 ; that falsities
are verified and softened by good, because they are applied and made condu
cive to good, and to the removal of evil, n. 8149; that the falsities of religion
with those who are in good, are received by the Lord as truths, n. 4736, 8149 ;
that the good whose quality is from a false principle of religion, is accepted by
the Lord, if there be ignorance, and if there be in it innocence and a good end,
n. 7887 ; that the truths which are with man are appearances of truth and good,
tinctured with fallacies, but that the Lord nevertheless adapts them to genuine
truths with the man who lives in good, n. 2053 ; that falsities in which there is
good exist with those who are out of the church and thence in ignorance of the
truth, also with those within the church where there are falsities of doctrine, n.
2589-2604, 2861, 2863, 3263, 3778, 4189, 4190, 4197, 6700, 9256."
And now, in view of the above citations, I must be allowed to ask what pos
sible ground you could have had for conveying to your readers the impression
they will naturally receive from your language, that " he often expresses it as
his judgment, that none except those who constitute the New Church have any
knowledge of the true spiritual sense of the word of God, or any title to the bless
ings of the gospel ?" Do these extracts sound forth a sentence of excommuni
cation from the true Church and of exclusion from heaven against all who have
not given in a formal adhesion to the doctrines I am advocating ? Do the fol
lowing paragraphs sound like it ?
" The doctrine of charity, which is the doctrine of life, was the essential doc
trine in the ancient Churches ; and that doctrine conjoined all Churches, and
thereby formed one Church out of many. For they acknowledged all those
to be members of the Church, who lived in the good of charity, and called
them brothers, however they might differ in truths, which at this day are
called matters of faith. In these they instructed one another, which was
amongst their works of charity ; nor were they angry if any one did not accede,
to another's opinion, knowing that every one receives truth in such proportion
as he is in good." —H. D. N. J. 9.
" There are two things which conjoin the men of the Church, viz. ; life and
doctrine ; when life conjoins, doctrine does not separate ; but if only doctrine
conjoins, as at this day is the case within the Church, then they mutually sepa
rate, and make as many Churches as there are doctrines ; when yet doctrine is
for the sake of life, and life is from doctrine. That they separate themselves if
only doctrine conjoins, is evident from this, that he who is of one doctrine, con
demns another [of a different doctrine] sometimes to hell ; but that doctrine doth
not separate, if life conjoins, is evident from this, that he who is in goodness of
life doth not condemn another who is of another opinion, but leaves it to his
faith and conscience, and extends this rule even to those who are out of the
Church, for he saith in his heart that ignorance cannot condemn any, if they live
in innocence and mutual love, as infants, who are also in ignorance when they
die."— A. C. 4468.

*' It is provided, that every one in whatever heresy he is as to the understand
ing, may still be reformed and saved, provided he shuns evils as sins, and does
not confirm heretical falsities with himself; for by shunning evils as sins, the
will is reformed, and through the will the understanding, which then first comes
out of darkness into light. There are three essentials of the Church, the ac
knowledgment of the Divine of the Lord, the acknowledgment of the sanctity of
the Word, and the life which is called charity ; according to the life, which is
charity, every man has faith ; from the Word is the knowledge of what life must
be ; and from the Lord is reformation and salvation. If these three had been as
the essentials of the Church, intellectual dissensions would not have divided,
but only varied it,as the light varies the colors in beautiful objects, and as vari
ous diadems make the beauty in a king's crown." —D. P. 259.
I
beg that neither you nor any one else will infer from this, that Swedenborg
represents the truth
of
doctrine as
a
matter of little or no importance. He is as
far from this as possible. But he is, as he designs to be, very explicit in his
teaching that doctrinal belief
is
no infallible test of moral character, and that as
evil of life may co-exist with the acknowledgment of many truths, so the good
of life may be found in conjunction with many falsities of doctrine.
" AH except the few who belong to the Swedenborgian church are in dark
ness. The disciples of Swedenborg are in the truths of faith which are from the
goods of charity
;
but the rest are in falses." Swedenborg knows no disciples,
in the sense in which your language would naturally be understood. The re
ceivers of
S
wedenborg's doctrines know no master but the Lord himself. Would
you be willingly termed a disciple of Paul, simply because you regarded Paul as
an illuminated expounder of the doctrines of Christ
?
Would you consent to be
called a disciple of Calvin, however you might look upon him as a well instruct
ed scribe in the mysteries of the kingdom
?
Would you not deem
it
as implying
a derogation in some degree from that supreme deference which you would

relation which,
if
anything could, we are sure would inflict a
pang of pain upon his beatified spirit. So also in regard to what you say of
the " Swedenborgian church." We know no such church. We have again and
again disclaimed the denomination before the world, and though we can scarcely
hope that the use of
it
will be waved, and though we doubt not
it
may be some
times employed simply by way of characteristic designation, yet we would fain

which has

if
our doctrines are true they are emphatically
the doctrines, and the only doctrines which the Lord acknowledges as constitut

viction that the doctrines in the abstract are trae ; but they see, by the same
light, that the demands of these doctrines on the life's love are so high and im
perative, that it is only with a trembling confidence that they presume to look
within for the evidence of their power. They are taught the fact of a heaven-
wide difference between a correct knowledge of the " truths of faith" and a living
experience of the " goods of charity." They find therefore a perpetual ground of
humiliation and holy fear in their conscious failures to reach the high mark of
their calling, and are, as a body, utter strangers to any such language of assurance
or self-complacency as one would think from your remarks to be the vernacular
dialect of their faith. But I would not meet such insinuations with acerbity of
spirit. I would simply enter a meek protest against the view you have pre
sented of our position as a Church. I could not desire to excite any other senti
ments than those which will spontaneously spring up in any candid and ingen
uous mind 6n a clear perception that it has wronged an opponent. Least of
all could I think of doing this in dealing with a spirit which I know to be, in ite
general actings, so tender of truth —so studious of justice —so prompt of repar
ation —as yours. That your statements on this head compel me to seek for them
some apology, is undoubtedly true, but I find it in the inward conviction that
your impressions were taken up from a partial and imperfect survey of the
genuine character of the system. I do not recognize the least intention to pre
sent it under a distorted aspect.
X. Purgatory. —" The doctrine of a purgatory is found in the writings of Swe-
denborg, —not exactly in the Popish form, but equally contrary to the common
faith of the Protestant Churches. He teaches that men are as really in a state of
probation after death, as before ; that in the world of spirits they go through a
course of discipline more particular and thorough, than in the present state, and
that, after their predominant affection has been clearly manifested, —after the re
mains of evil have been abstracted from those who are regenerated, and the
seeming good from the rest, which requires no inconsiderable length of time, the
former pass into heaven, the others into hell. This doctrine of another state of
trial after death is, we think, very different from the doctrine taught by Christ
and the Apostles, so that if Swedenborg was right, they were mistaken."
I deem it expedient here, as elsewhere, whenever possible, to array Sweden-
borg's own declarations against the counter-statements which are proposed by
his opponents. A writer's own confession of faith, when clearly and unequi
vocally expressed, is to be taken as a prima facie exponent of his real sentiments
on any particular point, though the attempt is entirely legitimate, on the part of
an opponent, to show that this is inconsistent with itself, or with something
else, taught by himself or others, that is beyond the reach of controversy. I am
not aware that Swedenborg's writings contain anything inconsistent with the
following statement.
" With respect to purgatory, I can aver, that it is a pure Babylonish fiction,
invented for the sake of gain, and that no such place does or can exist. Every
man, after death, first comes into the world of spirits, which is in the middle
between heaven and hell, and is prepared there either for heaven or hell, every
one according to his life in the world ; and in that world no one is tormented,
but the wicked then first come into torment, when after preparation, they go to,
hell. There are innumerable societies in that world, and enjoyments in them
similar to those upon earth, by reason that they who are there are conjoined

with men upon earth, who are likewise in the midst between heaven and hell.
The externals of such are successively put off, whereby their internals are laid
open, till at length the ruling love, which is the life's love, and the inmost, and
which governs the externals, discovers itself; when this is revealed, then the
true quality of the man appears, and according to the quality of that love, he is
sentforth from the world of spirits to his own place, if good, into heaven, and if
bad, into hell. That this is the case, it has been given me to know of a certainty,
because it has been granted me by the Lord to be with those who are in that
world, and to see everything, and thus to relate all from actual experience, and
this now for the space of twenty years. Wherefore I can assert that pureatory
is a fiction, which may be called diabolical from its having been invented for the
sake of gain, and for thesake of obtaining Dower over souls, even after death."
—A. R. 784.
Here we see that he expressly denies the Popish doctrine of Purgatory, and
yet you assert that the doctrine of a Purgatory is found in his writings, and yott
seem to rest the charge upon his alleged teaching that " men are as really in a
state of probation after death as before." How this is to be made clearly consis
tent with what immediately follows, that men go through a course of discipline
in the world of spirits in order to manifest their predominant affection, I am some
what at a loss to understand, as the manifestation of such an affection would seem
fairly to imply its previous formation, which of course is to be referred to the
present life. But I have still greater difficulty in reconciling the statement with
what Swedenborg says in the following paragraphs.
" The life of man cannot be changed after death ; it remains then such as it
had been; nor can the life of hell be transcribed into the life of heaven, since
they are opposite. Hence it is evident that they who come into hell, remain
there to eternity; and that they who come into heaven remain there to eternity."
—A. C. 10,749.
" The man who, in the world, has begun the first state (reformation), after death
can be introduced into the other (regeneration) ; but he who has not entered into
the first state in the world, cannot, after death, be introduced into the other, thus
cannot be regenerated." — T. C. R. 571.
" Man after death remains to eternity such as he is as to his will or reigning
love. —It was said by the angels that the life of the reigning love is never changed
with any one to eternity, since every one is his own reigning love ; wherefore
to change that love in a spirit would be to deprive him of his life, or to annihi
late him."—H. If H. 480.
Now a man's " reigning love" is no other than his " predominant affection,"
and this, though "manifested" in the other life, is never changed. How then
can you say that Swedenborg teaches that " men are as really in a stafe of pro
bation after death, as before ?" Does he not in fact, teach directly the reverse ?
There is, I admit, a sense of the term " probation," namely, that of trying or test
ing, for the purpose of ascertaining the qualities of anything, in which it may be
said that every spirit comes at death into a state of probation, for he enters im
mediately upon a process which shall prove and bring out his interior moral char
acter—his dominant loves and delights —by means of the spiritual associations,
into which he comes ; but this, as you are well aware, is not the sense which
the term bears in ordinary theological usage. It there has the import of an in
cipient forming or determining the character to good or evil, to heaven or hell,
according to the direction of a man's volitions. What else than this can you

mean by calling it " the doctrine of another state of trial after death," and speak-

ing of it as something " very different from the doctrine taught by Christ and the
Apostles?" Yet how is it different, if he, as well as they, teaches that there is
no change, except in degrees of development, in a man's moral character after
death ? As you seem to have precluded yourself from all future opportunity of
complying with the demands of justice in rectifying erroneous statements in re
gard to Swedenborg's doctrines, you will allow me, iu the present instance, to
" supply your lack of service" in this respect.
But does not Swedenborg, you will ask, distinctly teach, in contrariety to the
whole current of Protestant creeds, that the spirits of men do not, after death, go
immediately to heaven or hell, but enter into a mixed and intermediate state,
where they are severally prepared for their final allotment of happiness or misery ?
He does ; and all his adherent* firmly believe
it,
because they are satisfied that
he was supernaturally empowered to disclose the truth on this head, and be
cause they perceive a rational ground for the doctrine in the elemental prin
ciples of their being. They see nothing in the nature of the change wrought
by death that
is
especially calculated of itself to work a separation of the min

of the great mass of mankind. This elimination, however, they are convinced
must take place, and in a way too that shall not suspend for a moment the free
and voluntary actings of the soul. Of course they regard the process as gradual,
and they not only accord most fully with the statements which Swedenborg has
given in the following paragraph, but they recognize the process as based upon
the soundest philosophy of our moral and intellectual constitution.*
" As far as the truths which are of the understanding, are conjoined to the
goods which are of the will, thus as far as
a
mau wills truths and thence does
them, so far he has heaven in himself, since the conjunction of good and truth
is
heaven
:
but as far as the falses which are of the understanding are conjoined
to the evils which are of the will, so far man has hell in himself, because the
conjunction of what
is
false and evil
is
hell
:
but as far as the truths which are
of the understanding are not conjoined to the goods which are of the will, so far
man
is
in
a
middle state. Almost every man at this day
is
in such a state, that
he knows truths, and from science and also from understanding thinks them,
and either does much of them, or little of them, or nothing of them, or contrary
to them, from the love of evil and thence the faith of what
is
false
;
therefore, in
order that he may have either heaven or hell, he
is
after death first brought into
the world of spirits, and there
a
conjunction of good and truth
is
made with those
who are to be elevated into heaven, and a conjunction of evil and the false with
those who are to be cast into hell. For
it
is
not permitted to any one, in heaven
nor in hell, to have a divided mind, that is, to understand one thing and to will
another; but what he wills, he must also understand, and what he understands,
he must also will. Wherefore in heaven he who wills good must understand
truth, and in hell he who wills evil must understand what
is
false
;
therefore
with the good falses are there removed, and truths are given agreeable and con
formable to their good, and with the evil truths are there removed, and falses
are given agreeable and conformable to their evil. From these things
it
is
evi
dent what the world of spirits is."—H.

of the express chapter and verse of Scripture in support of the doctrine, I cannot
give it ; nor for myself do I feel the need of
it.
If
a
professed revelation respect
ing the conditions of the human spirit in another life appeals, for the establish
ment of its credibility, to the soundest rational inductions of my own mind, and
contains nothing contrary to what
I
read in the general tenor of the Scriptures,
why should

?
Has truth upon these subjects no evidence what
ever except what
is
derived from the literal affirmances of the inspired oracles
?
What
is
the authority for
a
thousand pulpit representations of the particular
forms of the happiness of heaven and the misery of hell to which you and
I
have
often listened
?
They may not be always correct— indeed
I
am persuaded they
are generally incorrect —but they are obviously made on the assumption of
the soundness of certain general principles, which are deemed sufficient to war
rant the recital of various specific details growing out of them. May we not re
cognize as much certainty in the fundamental principles of our nature as laid
down by Swedenborg, and upon which he builds all the details of his disclo-
XI. All Angels and Spiritsfrom the Human Race. —" This leads me to say, more
particularly, in the 11th place, that Swedenborg's ideas of the future world, and
the character and state of its inhabitants, are in various respects, at variance
with the teachings of God's word. He holds that all the angels in heaven and
all the devils in hell are from the human race, and once lived in this world as we
do now. Of course he makes the history of paradise a mere allegory, as there
could have been ho wicked being to tempt the parents of the human race, and
no such beings as Jude and Peter speak of, namely " the angels who kept not
their first estate," and "the angels that sinned." When Christ says that, in the
future world, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels
of God in heaven, the meaning according to Swedenborg must be, they are
angels. But this, he thinks, does not prevent their marrying; for he says they
are men and women after death, as they are before, that they have conjugal love,
and are joined, as male and female, in marriage —though
it
is
all spiritual."
As you do not intimate in what respects you regard Swedenborg's ideas of the
future world, and the character and state of its inhabitants, to be at variance
with the teachings of the word of God, except
it
be in respect to the true nature
of angels and devils,
I
presume
I
am at liberty to consider this as the point
which you had especially in your eye in making the assertion. Upon this
I
have first to correct an error in your statements, and, secondly, to consider how
far the alleged error in Swedenborg's statements
is
an error. " He holds that all
the angels in heaven and all the devils in hell, are from the human race, andonct
lived in this world, as we do now." The clause in Italics
is
entirely a mistake,
and one of so gross
a
nature that
I
am not a little at a loss to conceive how
it
could have originated.
I
do not well understand how a writer could have ac
quired sufficient knowledge of the system to feel authorized to make any denial
on this subject, and should yet have failed so utterly to represent the fact as
it
is. Swedenborg indeed informs us that all angels and devils are from the hu
man race, but then he expressly asserts, over and over again, that the human

part of your work, made copious extracts from the little volume entitled " Earths
in the Universe," in which you speak of his descriptions " of the men and women
who live there, the form of their faces, their clothing," &c. You must have
known, moreover, that he distinctly affirms that he gained his information res-
pecting these various worlds and their inhabitants from the spirits that once
dwelt in them, with whom his spirit had intercourse. All these spirits be
come angels or demons in the spiritual world. Can 1 then but wonder ex
ceedingly that you should here represent him as holding, that all these beings,
" once lived in this world, as we do now !" You can easily imagine how greatly
my ingenuity is taxed to frame an adequate solution of the problem involved
in your statement on this head.
As to the objection that he is compelled to " make the history of Paradise a
mere allegory, as there could have been no wicked being to tempt the parents
of the human race," methinks this does not come with the very best grace from
one who insists so strenuously upon the rigor of literal interpretation, for the
letter of the narrative speaks only of a bona file serpent as the tempter, and says
not a word of any spirit good or evil as having anything to do in the transaction.
You must either, therefore, suppose the word serpent to denote an evil spirit, while
no literal serpent was present, or you must hold that such a spirit employed
an actual serpent as an instrument and miraculously spake through him, which,
though I once believed it to be the true solution, I now, upon the ground of
clearer views, reject as totally inadequate and inapposite. It is to me altogether
incredible that a serpent should have uttered articulate sounds under the prompt
ings of an intelligent agent, and that the woman should have been deceived by
the machinations of a being of so much power, but of whose existence she had
received not the slightest intimation. If it be replied that the whole matter is to
be resolved simply into the power of the Most High, I can only say that Omnipo
tence alone can never solve the problems which involve the other Divine per
fections, or silence the voice of our cool and reverential reason. Still I deem it
probable that you have no difficulty in receiving the solution, although it is cer
tainly advancing beyond the strictness of the letter into the region of allegory to
understand by serpent anything but a serpent.
As to what is said by Jude and Peter of " the angels who kept not their first
estate," and " the angels that sinned," I am prepared to show, upon the strictest
principles of exegesis, that these passages have no reference to an event that
transpired in heaven, and answering to what is termed " the fall of angels," but
that it relates entirely to the apostacy of the antediluvians. I reserve the dis
cussion however to another contemplated work.
You will not, I trust, understand me as affirming that Swedenborg adheres
to the literal sense of the Mosaic narrative of the fall. Far from it. He makes
the serpent to be merely a symbol of the sensual principle in man, which is
continually tending to seduce his higher nature to a compliance with its dictates,
and teaches that it was in this way that the fall was effected, just as every man
falls at the present day. If there were diabolical influxes operating upon the
sensual lusts at that time, which he does not expressly affirm, there were no
doubt evil spirits in existence frdm some part of the universe, to act the part
which they ordinarily do in tempting man to sin.

spirits are from the human race, of our own or some other earth. As I propose,
if life and health are spared, to treat this subject at length in a future publication,
I shall at present content myself with a brief extract from " Noble's Appeal,"
which will lay open the grounds of the New Church doctrine in regard to the
origination of angels and spirits. " What is man ? The Scriptures assure us, that
he is a being created in the image and likeness of God. This is the proper and
intrinsic nature of man, however he may have departed from it : and is it possi
ble to employ any other language that will accurately define the intrinsic nature
of an angel? Is an angel more than an image and likeness of God ? This would
be saying that angels absolutely are Gods. An image and likeness of God is a
being who receives life, love, and wisdom, of a genuine and heavenly nature,
from God : and is not this the definition both of a man and of an angel ? To pos
sess life, love, and wisdom, in himself, is the prerogative of God alone : to pos
sess life derivatively, accompanied with a species of love of a merely natural
kind, and with instincts supplying the place of wisdom, without a capacity to
recede from or alter them, belongs to the brute creation alone : and to possess
life derivatively, accompanied with a power of rising from natural love to spir
itual, and attaining to the enjoyment of a love and wisdom truly human, imaging
the divine love and wisdom from which they are derived, belongs to the only
other conceivable order of animated creatures,—the only species of being that
can exist between the all-perfect, the infinitely wise and good God, and the irra
tional animal. Such a being is man : and such a man, when he has passed from
this natural into the spiritual sphere of existence, is an angel."—p. 282.
To this I add the following from Swedenborg, as to which you will of course
act your pleasure whether to regard it as a sober and veritable relation, or as the
dreaming or raving of a wild hallucination. I suspect that to many of my read
ers it will have a certain air of rational probability that will at least create a sus
picion that it is not very far from the truth.
"But to proceed now to experience. That angels are human forms' or men,
has beeu seen by me a thousand times. For I have spoken with them as man
with man, sometimes with one, sometimes with several in company ; nor have
I seen with them anything different from man as to form ; and I have repeatedly
wondered that they were such. And lest it should be said that it was a fallacy,
or a vision of phantasy, it has been given me to see them in full wakefulness, or
when I was in every sense of the body, and in a state of clear perception. Fre
quently also I have told them, that men in the Christian world are in such blind
ignorance concerning angels and spirits, that they believe them to be minds
without form, and pure thoughts, concerning which they have no other idea,
than as of something ethereal in which there is something vital ; and because
they thus ascribe to them nothing of man, except a thinking principle, they
believe that they do not see, because they have no eyes, do not hear because
they have no ears, and do not speak because they have not a mouth and tongue.
To these things the angels said, that they knew that there was such a belief with
many in the world, and that it reigned with the learned, and also, what they
wondered at, with the priests. They also said the cause was, that the learned
who were the leaders, and first broached such an idea concerning angels and
spirits, thought from the sensuals of the- external man concerning them ; and
they who think from those, and not from interior light, and from the general
idea which is implanted in every one, cannot do otherwise than construct such
fictions ; since the sensuals of the external man comprehend nothing else than
what is within nature, but not what is above
it,
thus nothing whatever concern
ing the spiritual world. From these leaders as guides was derived the falsity of
thought concerning the augels to others, who thought not from themselves but

from them ; and they who first think from others, and make those things mat
ters of their faith, and afterwards view them with their own understanding, can
scarcely recede from them; wherefore most acquiesce in confirming them.
Moreover they said that the simple in faith and heart are not in that idea con
cerning angels, but in an idea concerning them, as concerning men of heaven,
because they have not extinguished by erudition what was implanted in them
from heaven, nor do they comprehend anything without a form. Hence it is,
that the angels in temples, whether carved or painted, are not represented other
wise than as men. Concerning what is implanted from heaven, they said, that
it is the Divine flowing in with those who are in the good of faith and life.
" From all my experience, which now is of many years, I can say and affirm,
that angels as to their form are altogether men ; that they have fa^s, eyes, ears,
a breast, arms, hands, feet ; that they see and hear each other, and converse
together ; in a word, that nothing at all is wanting to them, which belongs to
man, except that they are not clothed with a material body. I have seen them
in their own light, which exceeds by many degrees the meridian light of the
world ; and in it all things of their face were seen more distinctly and clearly
than the faces of the men of the earth. It has also been given me to see an
angel of the inmost heaven: he had a brighter and more resplendent face than
the angels of the lower heavens ; I surveyed him, and he had a human form in
all perfection.
" Good spirits, with whom I have spoken also upon this subject, grieved in*
heart that such ignorance concerning the state of heaven and concerning spirits
and angels, should be within the church : and being indignant, they said that I
should certainly declare, that they are not minds without form, nor ethereal
spirits, but that they are men in form ; and that they see, hear, and feel, equally
as those who are in the world."—H. If H. 74, 75, 77.
XII. The Marriage Relation. —" Swedenborg's ideas respecting the marriage re
lation rose to a marvellous height. He says, that conjugal love belongs to an
gels, both of the superior and the inferior heaven ; that it is the head of all other
loves ; that it is the fundamental love of all heavenly, spiritual and natural
loves ; that into this love are gathered all joys and all delights from first to last ;
that it was the love of loves with those who formerly lived in the gold and silver
and copper ages. He says, that '
true conjugial love, which is a primary char
acteristic of the New Jerusalem Church, is more celestial, spiritual, holy, pure, and
dean, than any other love in angels or men.'"
To this you object as follows. *
" To such a statement as this we demur. True conjugal love is indeed a
pure, virtuous and honorable affection, and is designed by our Creator for ex
ceedingly important purposes in the church, and in civil and domestic society.
But where is it spoken of in the Scriptures, as the head-spring of all holy affec
tions, and as more celestial, spiritual, holy, pure and clean, than any other af
fection in heaven or earth ? The first and great commandment is not that which
requires love between husbands and wives, but that which requires supreme love
to God. We must of course conclude, that this affection is of superior excellence
to any other. And the second command, which requires love to our neighbors,
is like the first ; and this love must be considered as next in excellence to the
love of God. We have regarded supreme love to God, and equal or impartial
love to man, as the chief of the Christian graces. And if we change our opinion
on the subject, it will be because we consider Swedenborg as invested with
higher authority than Christ and the Apostles, and as commissioned to teach
doctrines widely different from theirs."— p. 133.
It is undoubtedly true that Swedenborg gives a most exalted character to true
conjugial love, and equally true is it that he gives the most ample reasons for so
doing. The subject is too vast to admit ofjustice being done to it in the limited
compass which yet remains to me, and I shall therefore attempt little more

•
than a brief statement, in his own words, of the grounds on which he ascribes
such a pre-eminent sanctity to the marriage relation. Beginning with the cita
tion of numerous passages in which the Lord is represented as the Husband
and Bridegroom of his Spouse, the Church, he goes on ;
" The reason why conjugial love considered in its essence is the foundation
love of all the loves of heaven and the church, is, because it originates in the
marriage of good and truth, and from this marriage proceed all the loves which
constitute heaven and the church with man : the good of this marriage consti
tutes love, and the truth thereof constitutes wisdom ; and when love accedes
to wisdom, or joins itself therewith, then love becomes love ; and when wis
dom in its turn accedes to love, and joins itself therewith, then wisdom becomes
wisdom. Love truly conjugial is the conjunction of love and wisdom. Two
married partners, between or in whom this love subsists, are an effigy and form
of it; all likewise in the heavens, where faces are the genuine types of the af
fections of every one's love, are likenesses of it ; for it pervades them in the
whole and in every part, as was shown above. Now as two married partners
in effigy and form are this love, it follows that every love which proceeds from the
form of essential love itself, is a resemblance thereof; wherefore if conjugial love
be celestial and spiritual, the loves proceeding from it are also celestial and spir
itual. Conjugial love therefore is as a parent, and all other loves are as the
offspring. The same is evident from the creation of man : in that he was created
for this love, and from his formation afterwards by means of this love. The
male was created to become wisdom grounded in the love of growing wise ;
and the female was created to become the love of the male grounded in his
wisdom, and consequently was formed according thereto ; from which consider
ation it is manifest, that two married partners are the very forms and effigies of
the marriage of love and wisdom, or of good and truth. Since natural loves
flow from spiritual loves, and spiritual from celestial, therefore it is said that
conjugial love is the foundation love of all celestial and spiritual loves, and thence
of all natural loves. Natural loves relate to the loves of self and of the world ;
but spiritual loves to love towards the neighbor : and celestial loves to love to
the Lord ; and such as are the relations of the loves, it is evident in what order
they follow and have place in man. When they are in this order, then the nat
ural loves live from the spiritual, and the spiritual from the celestial, and all in
this order from the Lord, in whom they originate. Into this love are collated all
joys and delights from first to last. All delights whatever, of which man has
any sensation, are delights of his love ; the love manifesting itself, yea, existing
and living thereby. That the delights are exalted in the same degree that the
love is exalted, and' also in the same degree that the incident affections touch the
ruling love more nearly, is a known thing. Now as conjugial love is the found
ation love of all good loves, and as it is inscribed on all the parts and principles
of man even the most particular, as was shown above, it follows that its de
lights exceed the delights of all other loves, and also that it gives delight to the
other loves, according to its presence and conjunction with them ; for it expands
the inmost principles of the mind, and at the. same time the inmost principles of
the body, as the delicious current of its fountain flows through and opens them.
" I am aware that few will acknowledge that all joys and delights from first to
last are collated into conjugial love; because love truly conjugial, into which
they are collated, is at this day so rare, that its quality is not known, and scarcely
its existence ; for such joys and delights exist only in genuine conjugial love ;
and as this is so rare on earth, it is impossible to describe its super-eminent felici
ties any otherwise than from the mouth of angels, because they are principled
in it. It has been declared by them, that the inmost delights of this love, which
are delights of the soul, into which the conjugial principle of love and wisdom,
or of good and truth from the Lord, first flows, are imperceptible and thence in
effable, because they are the delights of peace and innocence conjointly ; but
that in their descent they become more and more perceptible : in the superior
principles of the mind as beatitudes, in the inferior as satisfactions, in the breast
as delights thence derived ; and that from the breast they diffuse themselves
into every part of the body, and at length unite themselves in ultimates and be-

come the delight of delights. Moreover the angels have related wonderful
things respecting theser delights ; adding further, that their varieties in the souls
of conjugial pairs, and from their souls in their minds, and from their minds in
their breasts, are infinite and also eternal ; and that they are exalted according
to the prevalence of wisdom with the husband; and this,- because they live to
eternity in the flower of their age, and because they know no>greater blessedness
than to grow wiser and wiser." — C. L. 65-69.
It would seem from this that there can be no real conflict between the demands
of this love and of that supreme love to God and the neighbor which lies at the
basis of a true heavenly state. The character which is the subject of celestial
bliss is necessarily made up of the union of goodness and truth, or love and
wisdom, and this union is the very essence of the marriage relation, the man
being from his nature the impersonation of the Wisdom principle and the wo
man of the Love principle, the actual conjunction of both being requisite to a
perfect image of Jehovah, who is infinite Wisdom and infinite Love in indisso-
luble union. Here, then, as elsewhere, the doctrine of Swederrborg can only be
denied by denying the fundamental principle on which it rests. And I would
ask whether a view of this tender relation, exalting it to a dignity and sanctity
which had never before been conceived of, does not entitle its author to the
reverence and esteem of all those who devoutly value the Divine institutions ?
Could you be induced to give a candid perusal to the treatise on " Conjugial
Love," you would find, I think, that however it might be on other points, yet
on this your objections were super-abundantly answered.
XHI. Enjoyments and Pleasures of Heaven.— " And here I cannot but remark, that
the general description which Swedenborg gives of the employments and plea
sures of heaven falls immeasurably short of what we find in the Scriptures. He
seems to attach but little importance to the Scriptural idea, that the spirits of just
men in heaven are perfect in holiness ; that they are wilh Christ, and see him face
to face, and are like him ; that they inherit glory, honor and immortality —an
exceeding and eternal weight of glory. His heaven, as he commonly describes
it, is too earthly. Its employments and pleasures are, for the most part, but little
above those which are found among Christians here. The inhabitants are not
united in one happy society, having the same holy and happy affection. Their
opinions are different ; and their characters and tastes uncongenial, and they are
led to form innumerable societies, so that those who go there from different coun
tries, as England, Holland, Germany, &c. and those who had been under different
forms of religion, as Christians, Mahometans, Pagans, &c, and those who had
been engaged in different occupations, as preachers, philosophers, mathemati
cians, fee., those who had entertained different views of religion, those who had
been wise and those who had been ignorant, in short, every variety of men and
women may, after a sufficient number of trials, find their proper place, and live
in a society suited to their dispositions and habits.—Now, as to the heaven gen
erally described by Swedenborg, I would seriously ask, what is it compared
with the blessed state briefly 'described in the prayer of Christ :
'
Father, I will
that they whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my
glory.' Cudworth, and Howe, and Baxter, and other eminent divines, who have
formed their habit of thinking, not from visions, but from the word of God, have

-entertained views of the heavenly state unspeakably more pure, and spiritual
and exalted, than those of Swedenborg."
The grand characteristic of Swedenborg's disclosures on this head is their con-
gruity with the constituent principles of our nature as composed of Affection
which has relation to Good, and of Understanding which has relation to Truth.
A heaven which does not recognize these principles as its very basis in the soul
of man must be the merest phantasy that can be imagined. Such undoubtedly
is every idea of heaven which regards it mainly as a place of assemblage
—the
locale of an immense society gathered out of all nations, kindreds, and tongues
—and promiscuously convened in one vast redeemed concourse. Every con
ception of this nature we are taught by Swedenborg to regard as the product of
mere sensuous thought and partaking infinitely more of the worldly and corpo
real element than that which he affords us. Nothing can be more inapposite
than to regard heaven in the light of a place, instead of that of a state, from which
all ideas of place and space are necessarily to be excluded. There is of course a
principle of union in the common love which reigns in all the good, but as this
principle co-exists with truth in its innumerable varieties of intellectual form, it
must inevitably prompt to conjunction on the ground of mental sympathies and
predilections, and thus give rise to societies of countless number, all which,
being governed by the predominant human tendency, must arrange themselves
into the form of the Grand Man of heaven. The prevailing idea of a kind of gen
eral fusion or amalgamation, to be effected by death, of all the diverse elements
of character in those who have been born again, is to our apprehension one of the
crudest that can enter the human mind. Reflect for one moment whether you are
not acquainted with those of whose piety and prospects you cannot doubt, while
at the same time you would shrink from the idea -of a perpetual intimacy with
them of the nearest kind, from the consciousness that in a thousand particulars
their attainments, tastes, habits, &c. were not fully congenial with your own.
You would not feel this to be any disparagement to them, or to the work of the
Divine Spirit in their souls. The love in your heart must answer to the love in
theirs, because it flows from the same source and tends to the same centre.
But this fact cannot annul the intellectual differences by which you are severally
distinguished, nor can it prevent your yielding to the attraction of more conge
nial spirits as your abiding associates. The reply to this will no doubt be, that
we have reason to believe that the mighty leveller death will sink at once all
these inequalities and bring all the good into the most perfect harmony with

change in the fixed and characteristic attributes of the individual ? Why then
should not the constitutional differences of various peoples and races lay a foun
dation for that species of moral grouping which Swedenborg says obtains in the
heavens ? Why should not the pious Hindoo, the Chinaman, the Sandwich
Islander, if in the good of Christian life, be more strongly attracted to kindred
souls of their own respective nations, than to others whose entire course and
habits of thought have been cast in a different mould .' The infinitude of the
Divine Good can easily flow in and accommodate itself to the various recipient
forms and faculties by which they are severally distinguished, and this is of
course the essence of heaven under any supposition. If Swedenborg did not
represent this as the fact, we might well question the truth of his disclosures.
But I beg you to run your eye over the following items, referring to the " Arcana,"
where the subjects are treated at length, and see if you can conceive that he
lowers or lessens our rational ideas of the dignity, purity, blessedness, or glory of
the heavenly state.

through redemption from the Lord to the souls of " just men made perfect
.'"
And
is
not this the very employment which Swedenborg ascribes to the heirs of
the heavenly kingdom
?
How then are his representations a disparagement of
the Scriptural teachings on this head
?
If
you do not wholly doubt their com
petency to bear witness in the case, ask any of his adherents whether they have
found his statements to be attended with such effects as you intimate
?
Are
they conscious of the least weakening of the power of the motives to
a
holy life
drawn from the views of heaven which Swedenborg presents
?
Be assured they
will, with one voice, declare, that
it
is
increased an hundred fold. The vague
generalities of their former belief were comparatively inert and lifeless. They
have now a heaven set before them which
is
the mere crowning development
of the heaven that has been implanted within them. They know what
it
must
be, because they feel what
it
is. You will therefore very rightly infer that
I
am
at the farthest possible remove from admitting the justice of your strictures on
this feature of our system.
XIV. The Sufferings and Miseries
of
Hell. —" There
is
the' same palpable differ
ence between his ideas of hell and those of the sacred writers. The sufferings
of hell, as described in the word of God, are suited to awaken the deepest emo
tions of fear and dread, and so to deter men from wickedness. Those who are
doomed to that wretched place, are represented as under the wrath
of
God, as ban
ished from hispresence, as in the blackness
of
darkness, as cast into unquenchable fire, where
there
is
weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth. The most dreadful things in
creation are seized upon to set forth the miseries of the infernal abode. But
what
is
Swedenborg's hell
?
Why,
it
is
a great work-house, where the people
have tasks assigned them, not extremely hard, —which they are obliged to do
in order to get food.
It
is
somewhat like our State-Prison
;
though in some re
spects less dreadful to its depraved and guilty inmates."
I
might here easily and properly remand the course of discussion back to the
fundamental question of Swedenborg's illumination, and rest the truth or false
hood of his statements on this head upon the truth or falsehood of his general
claim.
If
he actually saw the verities of heaven and hell, has he not truly des
cribed them
?
Can you possibly reject his statements without first disproving his
pretensions? And can you discard the improbable in his revelations without
offering some more adequate solution of the probable than has yet been given
?
But
I
am willing to wave this form of reply and to attempt to sustain the truth
of his disclosures on the ground of their own intrinsic character. And here we
are not to forget that Swedenborg lays
it
down as a fundamental principle, that
both the celestial and infernal scenery, which appears objectively to spirits, is
the mirrored representative of their internal states as to affection and thought.
The scenery is, as
it
were, the visible form of the states, and the state of the in-
fernals
is
a
state constituted by the character of their ruling loves. These are
the loves of self and of the world, existing in the intensest degree and at once
including every wicked and baleful passion akin to them, and excluding every
good and heavenly prompting opposed to them. Every spirit of hell, there
fore,
is
a complex of the fiendish dispositions of malice, hatred, anger, envy,
revenge, cruelty, lust, desire of dominion, and goaded on by a continual impulse
to tut out these horrid tempers by inflicting all possible misery upon others.
Such being their dominant loves, their thoughts must correspond with them, and

as thought assumes form iu the other life, and as these forms become realities
from the necessity of the case, what must be the outward bodyings forth of these
internal states but a complication of just such hideous and revolting scenery as
Svvedenborg has described ? As they have no genuine truth in consequence of
having deprived themselves of the kindred good, they have no true wisdom,
and being destitute of true wisdom, they are destitute of true rationality, or iu
other words are virtually insane, though still able to exercise an infernal subtlety
and cunning in compassing their pernicious ends. In this condition they must
necessarily be in the indulgence of the wildest phantasies and imaginings, and
consequently surrounded by mental creations of to us the most loathsome and
terrific description, yet in many of which they, from the perverted actings of
their moral nature, experience a certain kind of hellish delight. Hence, as their
imaginings are turned into correspondent realities, their tossings upon furious
horses —their wounding by venomous serpents—their rending by ravenous
beasts —their murdering and being murdered by deadly weapons — and all the
sad variety of tortures to which they are subject under the outbreak of their evil
passions ; for in proportion as they put a restraint upon their infernal impulses,
the severity of their doom is mitigated, while at the same time no radical change
in their nature is effected.
If such then be indeed the real internal state of the wicked in hell—if the
very breathing of their souls is toward evil and destruction —shall we suppose
them to be left without check ? Will the infinite Love and Wisdom leave even
hell itself to become a perfect chaos of conflicting elements—a raging volcano
of infernal fires ? Do not our best conceptions of the Divine attributes compel
the belief that the hells shall be kept in some kind of order ? May not the com
passion of a God extend even to their wretched inmates ? May he not, as far as
possible, moderate and mitigate the extremities to which their evils are con
stantly prone to rush ? But how shall this be done, consistently with their free
agency, except by means of moral bonds, such as fears, threats, and punish
ments ? And even suppose they are so far overruled as to be made subservient
to certain kinds of v$es, ought this to derogate in our esteem from the perfections
that are manifested in their lot ? Is it any disparagement to our criminal codes
in this world that the inmates of our State-Prisons are made to labor in various
useful arts and callings as a part of their penal discipline ? And do we think it
wrong that extra punishments should be visited upon them for extra misde
meanors during their incarceration ? I should almost suppose from the follow
ing passage that your mind shrank from the idea of any kind of alleviation, from
any source, of the utmost intensity of anguish among these heirs of perdition.
" Swedenborg thinks, that the Lord, being exceedingly kind and compassionate,
endeavors, in all possible ways, to gratify the inclinations of the wicked in the
other world, and will sometimes, at their request, admit them to heaven as a
matter of trial. His indignation and wrath, i. e. his holy displeasure, against sin,
is not, according to Swedenborg an objective reality, but an illusive apprehension,
a phantasy of the guilty mind of man."— p. 136.
It is to me, I confess, in my better moods, a subject of rejoicing to think, that
the Lord is " so exceedingly kind and compassionate" as to allow such a trial as
you speak of to be made ; for the effect of it is plainly to evince that the Divine
Mercy is conspicuous in the hells, inasmuch as if it were the design to make the

wicked as miserable as possible, they would be violently urged into heaven,
which would be to them a far severer torture than they experience in hell. We
see then in this a demonstration of the awful wickedness of the infernals in hav
ing acquired a character which renders the bliss of heaven an element of intol
erable misery to them, and on the other hand a clear proof of the Divine clemency
in having provided for every one a state best suited to his internal quality, and
therefore more congenial to his tastes and wishes than any other.
But you say that according to Swedenborg, " his indignation and wrath, i. e.
his holy displeasure against sin, is not an objective reality, but an illusive appre
hension, a phantasy of the guilty mind of man." The evident implication is,
that you believe in a real indignation and wrath in the mind of God against
sin or the sinner, however the idea is apparently softened down by the some
what milder appellation of a " holy displeasure." The receivers of Swedenborg
find no authority for ascribing to the Deity any such passion as absolute anger or
displeasure, while at the same time they clearly perceive and expressly affirm
that the contrariety between the evil that is in man and the goodness and love
that is in God has, to the consciousness of the offender, the same positive effect as
if that which is apparent were real. But I have already presented our views on
this point with sufficient distinctness.
" Swedenborg was indeed led, by his longer residence in the hells, to entertain
other views, and to represent the punishments of the wicked as more appalling
and disgusting, than the labors and sufferings of the great work-houses above-
mentioned ; although the punishments arose from the creations of their own dis
tempered minds, like what often takes place in delirium or insanity. He says :
•
All who are in the hells, appear with their face backwards from the Lord, —and
with the feet upwards and the head downwards."' —p. 136.
I do not know precisely what you would have the reader understand by Swe-
denborg's "longer residence in the hells." I have not learnt from his own state
ments that he resided there at all. The term is certainly a very singular one to
apply to that spiritual perception and insight, by which he was made acquainted
with the condition of things in the spiritual world, including both heaven and
hell. I can scarcely believe that you intended to endorse Mr. Emerson's verdict,
that Swedenborg had a morbid propensity to be continually peering into infernal
glooms and horrors, for, as I have shown in my reply to that gentleman, the
whole tenor of his writings is directly the reverse. Yet you speak as if he
had taken up his abode in those doleful regions, and by a long sojourn there had
made himself by degrees fully acquainted with all the circumstances of the lot
of their inhabitants.
Again you quote him as saying :—" All who are in the hells appear with their
face backward from the Lord, —and with the feet upwards and the head down
wards." These indeed are his words, but how differently does the whole matter
Strike the reader when he is informed, that it is only to the angels of heaven that
they have this inverted appearance, whereas in their own eyes, and as seen by
each other, they seem to stand normally erect, with their heads upwards and
their feet downwards. The light of heaven is the light of truth, which reveals
things as they are. The light of hell is a mere fatuuous lumen which falsifies
realities, for there all truth is perverted and all order inverted.
In this connection I meet with the following paragraph :—

" According to Swedenborg, these various punishments of hell are phantasies or
illusive apprehensions, created by the disordered fancy of the sufferers, like the
frantic and frightful conceptions of maniacs. Now is there not reason to think
that the ideas of these things, which arose in the mind of Swedenborg, were also
phantasies, the creations of a lively and fruitful mind, under the influence of a very
singular, protracted, and profound delirium, —still resulting in a great measure,
from his previous speculations on the subject of future punishment?" —p. 138.
This convenient theory of " previous speculations" has met us several times
before, and I very much doubt whether any creation of Swedenborg's mind is
more fully entitled to be termed a phantasy than is such a conceit in your own.
But to tarn for a moment to the reasoning ;—because Swedenborg declares
that a great portion of the punishments among the spirits of the pit originate
in phantasy, ycu would therefore have us believe that his representations them
selves come into the same category. This implies at any rate that you admit
thefact of such phantasies, and consequently admit the possibility of their obtain
ing among infernal spirits, for in granting that Swedenborg may have been im
posed upon by phantasies, because that phantasies reign in the spiritual world,
you of course concede that what he says on this subject may be true. The ques
tion then arises as to the probability of the punishments of hell originating, in great
measure, from this source. Now you are aware that the use of the term, on
Swedenborg's principles, does not imply that the objects of phantasy, thus men
tally projected, are not real to the percipients. A phantastic hydra to a lost spirit
fe in effect a real hydra, because it is really seen by him, and its bite produces a
real sensation of pain. The mental things of the other hfe are to spirits real
things, and if they suffer at all from anything that is objective to them, why
should it not be from this cause as well as any other ? Is there not therefore an
adequate and philosophical ground for Swedenborg's assertion on this head, and
how can you fairly deduce an inference of delusion in his case from premises
involving a positive truth ? Is the enunciation of a sound and rational principle
the proof of an unsound and phantastic state of mind in him who makes it?
Besides, if he were the mere dupe of " illusive apprehensions" in these state
ments, they were no doubt injected into his mind by these very spirits whose
character and condition he is setting forth, and as they live, move and breathe, in
an element of falsities, it were a much more probable supposition that if they
designed to play upon him by phantasies, they would never have prompted an
expose of their state so marked by an air of intrinsic truth' —so well calculated
to stand the test of rigid psychological' inquest. If they continually pour forth
falsities on every other subject, why not on this also? " Let every one," says
Swedenborg, " take heed to himself when he comes into the other life, Test he
be illuded ; for evil spirits know how to present various illusions before those
who have recently come from the world, and if they cannot deceive, still they
try, by those illusions, to persuade that nothing is real, but that all things are
ideal, even those which are in heaven." How much more then these which are
in hell !
Again, you object to that feature of his revelations respecting the hells which
denies the actings of remorse —the pain inflicted by a guilty conscience —in
the bosom of infernals. And this, you say, is very remarkable. He labors
abundantly in other ways to teach us, that man in the next world will be man
still, man altogether, possessed of all the faculties and senses and affections, which
he has here ; and yet he holds that the sinners in hell will be destitute of that

which is such a constant and dreadful accompaniment of guilt in the present
world." Now it is in fact upon this very basis of the permanence of man's nature
and character in the world to come, that the position in question rests. The
wicked in hell are not tormented by remorse of conscience because, the very
effect of their wickedness is to destroy conscience, as we see evinced beyond
all question in the present life. Who but is aware that every act of crime dead
ens more and more the sense of guilt, till in some cases there results a perfect
obtuseness of the moral sensibility ? The career of iniquity does not perhaps
often reach this point in the present world : but the inherent and inevitable tend
ency of all evil is to extinguish conscience, and consequently remorse, which acts by
means of conscience. How often do we learn from the confessions of those
who have become monsters in crime, that the inward voice of remonstrance
which rebuked the first stages of their transgression, became fainter and fainter
as they advanced, till at last it died away in their ear, and conscience became
seared as with a red hot iron ? But you will probably say of conscience in such
cases that it " is not dead, but sleepeth," that its function is merely temporarily
in abeyance, and that it will eventually awaken and speak in thunder tones to
the ear of the soul. Yet what solid reasons have we for this opinion ? I readily
admit that the worst men, particularly in Christian countries, where the moral
sense of the community creates a kind of conscientious sphere that is widely per
vasive, will often experience transient pangs and checks in the progress of crime,
but this is owing to the influence of remains, or sentiments of goodness and truth
stored away in the mind in infancy and childhood, which are slow in being ex
tinguished, but extinguished they may be, and eventually^are, in all the'irreclaim-
ably evil, either in this life or the next. I admit too that when crime has lost its
impunity and the offender is brought up and called to face the prospect of pun
ishment awarded by the law, and to cast his eye directly forward into what he
has been taught to consider hell —as a place of intolerable misery— he will, in
conjunction with the acting of remains, be visited by a " certain fearful looking
for of judgment," which is ordinarily termed the operation of remorse, but the
emotion when analysed will be found to be mainly prospective in its intimations
and of the same nature withfear. So far as it is retrospective it is merely the per
ception of the causes which have led to certain effects, from the experience of
whick the soul instinctively shrinks. But it does not necessarily imply any real
regret—any godly sorrow —for sin as sin, since this would be a germ of repent-
ence and reformation. All this mustof course become extinct when the ultima
tum is reached, and the soul is let fully in to its ruling principle and the delight
of its love, as it is in hell. It is there in its very element and life/and it can have
no more prompting or desire to change the current of its life's love than a flowing
stream can have any tendency to reverse its current and flow backward. The
following will be seen to be a very impressive paragraph as viewed in this con
nexion

man's affection be that of self and the world, then his whole life is nothing else,
nor can he strive against
it,
for this would be to strive against his own life
;
principles of truth effect nothing;
if
the affection of those loves has dominion,
it
draws truth over to its side, and so falsifies it, and
if
it
does not so favor, rejects
it. From these considerations
it
may now be manifest, that man in no case sets
his heart to any truth,
if
the will resists
:
hence
it
is
that the infernals, inasmuch
as they are in the affections or lusts of evil, cannot receive the truths of faith,
consequently cannot be amended." —A. C. 7342. .
Remorse can only arise when the soul is still in
a
condition to array before
itself, by an intellectual process, the antagonism existing between the evil which
it
loves and the good for which
it
was designed. This
is
the plane on which
conscience can generally act in the present life, but this plane perishes when the
soul passes into hell, and the evil love becomes so overwhelmingly predomi
nant that all the opposing judgments of the intellect melt away and are absorbed
into
it,
and the very sense of the contrariety between its present state and its
original destination to a better
is
utterly lost. Where then
is
the ground for the
actings of remorse
?
How can
a
soul feel remorse that has reached the point of
saying, " Evil be thou my good ?" "
I
have occasionally discoursed," says our
author, " with those in another life who have been in the delights of evil and
the false, and
it
was given me to tell them, that they have no life till they are
deprived of their delights. They replied, as such people in the world say, that
if
they were deprived of those delights, there would be nothing of life remain
ing with mem. But
it
was given me to answer, that life then first commences,
and
is
attended with such happiness as
is
enjoyed in heaven, which
is
compar
atively ineffable. This, however, they were unable to comprehend, because what
is
un
known
is
believed to be nothing."
It
seems, therefore, that they had lost the very
perception of a contrary kind of life, that is, of a contrary love.
And now permit me to ask, what there
is
in all this that tends to lower an in
telligent estimate of the real constituents of hell
?
What that goes to weaken the
moral power of the sanctions drawn from this source to enforce the claims of
a
holy life
?
Can a reflecting mind conceive a more terrific idea of perdition than
when viewed as a state in which not only conscience and remorse have become
extinct, but their very ground-work destroyed, and even the sense of an opposite
internal state of the soul annihilated
?
Not but that these wretched spirits know,
by abarren intellection, that there
is
a heaven, and that they are not in
it,
just as
a
supremely wicked man may know that there
is
such a form of character as that
possessed by a devout and humble Christian. But what kind of knowledge
is
this
?
Does
it
approach to anything like
a
realizing sense of the difference
between the two characters
?
Can
it
consist with the least true desire for an
inward change in himself, so long as he remains under the full power of his evil,
selfish, and sensual love
?
There
is
to me something inexpressibly awful in the
representation given on this head in what follows, particularly the relation at the
close
:
—
" Delight
is
the all of life to all in heaven, and the all of life to all in hell.
Those who are in heaven, have the delight of what
is
good and true, but those
who are in hell have the delight of what
is
evil and false
;
for all delight
is
of
love, and lovers the esse of the life of man
;
wherefore, as man
is
man according
to the quality of his love, so he
is
man according to the quality of las delight.
The activity of love makes the sense of delight

exhibits delight. But the heavens and the hells are in opposite delights ; the heav
ens being in the love of good, and thence in the delight of doing good; but the
hells, in the love of evil, and thence in the delight of doing evil. If, therefore,
you know what delight is, you will know what heaven and hell are. The will,
from which man is man, is not moved even a single atom, except by delight ; for
the will, viewed in itself, is only an affection of some love, thus of delight ; for it is
some pleasure, and thence satisfaction, which causes it to will ; and because the
will impels the understanding to think, there is not given the least of thought
but from the influent delight of the will. The reason that it is so, is because the
Lord, by influx from Himself, actuates all things of the soul and all things of the
mind with angels, spirits and men; and He actuates by an influx of love and
wisdom, and this influx is the very activity from which all delight is, which in
its origin is called blessed, prosperous and happy ; and in its derivation, delightful
agreeable and pleasant ; and in a universal sense, good. But infernal spirits in
vert all things with them: thus they turn the good into evil, and the true into
false, delight still remaining, for unless delight remained, they would not have
will, nor sensation, thus not life. Hence it is manifest, what and whence is the

from the delight of their love ; and because the angels who were consociated
with the novitiate spirit, perceived that those three providentially ascended from
hell, they cried to the devils, '
Do not come any nearer, but from the place where
you are, tell something concerning your delights.' And they replied,
' Know that
every one, whether he be called good or evil, is in his own delight; the good, so
called, in his, and the evil, so called, in his.' And the angels asked, '
What is
your delight ?' They said that it was the delight of committing whoredom, of
revenging, of defrauding, and of blaspheming. And again they asked, '
What is
the quality of those delights,of yours ?' They said, that they were perceived by
others as fetid smells from dunghills, as putrid smells from dead bodies, and
as noisome smells from filthy pools. And they asked, '
Are those things de
lightful to you ?' They said, '
They are most delightful.' Then said they, '
You:
are like the unclean beasts that live in them.' And they replied, ' If we are, we
are ; but such things are the delight of our nostrils.' And they asked, '

the most unclean, as they call
it,

but because, from our delight, we could not do otherwise than infest them
we were cast into work-houses, where we suffer hard things. The hindering

like the fire of hatred

experience are not laid in the constitution of man's nature, so that the experience
itself shall be absolutely inevitable. I have for myself much more than a suspi
cion that all that Swedenborg has declared on this subject will be found in the
issue to be true.
XV. Miracles. —" We have seen that Swedenborg made no pretensions to the
power of working miracles, and held that miracles are not to be expected at the
present day. I will not stop to inquire, how the visits he made to heaven and
hell, and to the planets, and the starry worlds, and the revelations made to him
there, differ essentially from miracles. My design is merely to notice the reason
he gives, why miracles are not to be expected at the present day ; namely, 'that
they carry compulsion with them, and take away man's free will in spiritual
things.' I cannot admit this reason to be valid. For if this is the nature and
tendency of miracles, then all the miracles wrought by Christ to prove his Mes-
siahship, and all those wrought by the Apostles to confirm the truth of the gos
pel and the faith of Christians, carried compulsion with them, and took away
man's free will ; and, of course, those who witnessed the miracles, so far as they
experienced the designed effects of them, were under a compulsory influence,
which deprived them of their free will, and rendered them incapable of anything
morally excellent or praiseworthy. If such be the case, how strange it is, that
Christ did so many miracles himself, and gave miraculous powers to so many
of his disciples, and that such an important use was made of miracles in the
propagation of the Christian religion ! What a groundless fancy, that miracles
such as were wrought by Moses and Joshua and Elijah, and by Christ and his
Apostles, '
carried compulsion with them, and took away man's free will !'
"
The use and design of miracles in connection with a revelation from heaven
is often, I think, very crudely considered by theologians, and for one I feel greatly
indebted to Swedenborg for the light which he has thrown on the subject. The
drift of his teaching is, that the design of miracles is mainly to compel attention to
a divine message, the constraining evidence of which is, at the same time, really
in the truth itself announced. This evidence the mind must receive by the light
inhering in the evidence in order to command faith. The intrinsic effect of mira
cles falls short of this, and merely produces a kind of persuasion affecting rather
the external than the internal region of the mind. As a confirmation of moral
truth a miracle undoubtedly does a species of violence to the tranquillity of
rational belief, and it is only in this way that Swedenborg represents it as mili
tating with free agency. The mind is conscious of a certain astounding and con
founding effect produced upon it by an exhibition to the senses of a supernatural
power, which tends to suspend, to a degree, the free and calm exercise of the
judgment in view of the internal character of the doctrine proposed to be estab
lished.
But in order to assure myself of not doing an imperfect justice to Swedenborg's
enunciations on this head and to give the reader the fairest opportunity to judge
of their soundness, I shall make him the expounder of his own doctrine.

with man, if miracles were done, and man was driven by them to believe. That
it is so, may be seen rationally thus : it cannot be denied but that miracles in
duce faith and strongly persuade that that is true which he who does the mira
cles says and teaches ; and that this in the commencement so occupies the ex
ternal of man's thought, that it as it were binds and enchants : but man is there
by deprived of his two faculties, which are called rationality and liberty, so that
he cannot act from freedom according to reason, and then the Lord cannot flow
in through the internal into th'e external of his thought, except only to leave to
man to confirm that thing from his rationality whiclr' was made of his faith by
the miracle. The state of man's thought is such, that by the internal of thought
he sees a thing in the external of his thought, as in a certain mirror ; for, as was
said above, man can see his thought, which cannot be given except from interior
thought.
" From these things it may be evident, that faith induced by miracles is not
faith, but persuasion ; for there is not any rational in
it,
still less any spiritual
;
for
it
is
only an external without an internal
:
it
is
the like with all that man does
from that persuasive faith, whether he acknowledges God, or worships Him at
home or in temples, or does kindnesses
:
when a miracle alone induces man to
acknowledgment, worship and piety, he acts from the natural man, and not from
the spiritual; for
a
miracle infuses faith through an external way, and not
through an internal way
;
thus from the world, and not from heaven
;
and the
Lord does not enter through any other way with man but through the internal
way, which
is
through the Word, doctrine and preachings from
it
:
and because
miracles shut this way, therefore at this day no miracles are done.
" But the effect of miracles
is
other with the good than with the evil
;
the good
do not wish miracles, but believe the miracles which are in the Word
;
and
if
they hear anything concerning
a
miracle, they do not attend to
it
otherwise than
as to
a
light argument which confirms their faith
;
for they think from the Word,
thus from the Lord, and not from a miracle. The evil do otherwise
;
they indeed
may be driven and compelled to faith, yea, to worship and to piety, by miracles
;
but only for a little time
;
for their evils are shut up, the concupiscences of which
and the delights thence, continually act into the external of their worship and
piety
;
and that they may get out of their confinement and burst forth, they think
concerning the miracle, and at length call
it
a
mockery and an artifice, or the
work of nature, and thus they return into their evils
;
and he who returns into
his evils after worship, profanes the truths and goods of worship
;
and the lot
of profaners after death
is
the worst of all
:
these are they who are understood
by the words of the Lord in Matt. xii. 43, 44, 45
;
whose latter state becomes
worse than the former. Besides,
if
miracles were done with those who do not
believe from the miracles in the Word, they would be done continually and be
fore the sight with all such. From these things
it
may be evident whence
it
is
that miracles are not done at this day." —D. P. 130-133.

it
is
to be known that they were done amongst such as were in external

hence
it
is
that
miracles were done amongst the Israelitish and Jewish people, for they were
solely in external worship, and in no internal

and also external worship was
what they ought to be in, when they were not willing to be in internal worship,
to the intent that in externals they might represent holy things, and so commu
nication might be given with heaven, as by somewhat of a church, for corres
pondences, representatives, and significatives conjoin the natural world to the
spiritual

it
was, that so many miracles were done amongst that

compel to believe, and what is of compnlsion does not reniain, but is dissipated.
The internal things of worship, which are faith and charity, are to be implanted
in a free principle, for then they are appropriated, and the things which are so
appropriated remain; but the things which are implanted in a state of compul
sion, remain out of the internal man in the external : for into the internal man
nothing enters except by intellectual ideas, which are reasons [rationes], for the
ground which there receives is the rational illustrated : hence it is that no mira
cles are wrought at this day. That they are also hurtful, may hence be mani
fest : for they drive men to believe, and fix ideas in the external man that it is
so; if the internal man afterwards denies what miracles have confirmed, then
an opposition and collision of the internal and external man takes place, and at
length, when the ideas derived from miracles are dissipated, there is effected a
conjunction of the false and the true, thus profanation. Hence it is evident, how
hurtful miracles are in this day in the church, in which the internals of worship
are discovered. These things are also signified by the Lord's words to Thomas,
'
Because thou hast seen Me, Thomas, thou hast believed ; blessed are they who
do not see, and believe' (John xx. 29) : so also they are blessed, who do not be
lieve by miracles. But miracles are not hurtful to those who are in external
worship without internal, for with such no opposition can be given of the inter
nal and external man, thus no collision, consequently no profanation. That
miracles do not contribute anything to faith, may be sufficiently manifest from
the miracles wrought amongst the people of Israel in Egypt, and in the wilder
ness, in that they had no effect at all upon them : for that people, although they
so lately saw so many miracles in Egypt, afterwards the Red Sea divided, and
the Egyptians overwhelmed therein, the pillar of the cloud going before them by
day, and the pillar of fire by night, the manna, daily showering down from
heaven ; and although they saw Mount Sinai in smoke, and heard Jehovah thence
speaking, with other miracles of a like kind ; nevertheless, in the midst of such
things, they declined from all faith, and from the worship of Jehovah to the
worship of a calf (Exod. xxxii. 1 to the end) : hence it is evident what is tf e ef
fect of miracles. Still less would be their effect at this day, when it is not ac
knowledged that there is anything from the spiritual world, and when everything
of the sort which takes place, and which is not attributed to nature, is denied :
for a principle of denial universally reigns against the divine influx and govern
ment in the earths; wherefore at this day the man of the church, if he were to
see the veriest diviue miracles, would first bring them down into natnre, and
there defile them, and afterwards would reject them as phantasms, and lastly
would laugh at all who attributed them to the Divine, and not to natnre : that
miracles are of no effect, is also evident from the Lord's words in Lake ;
'
If they
hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose
from the dead' (xvi. 31)." —A. C. 7290.
The subject is still farther prosecuted in the paragraph annexed, in which yon
will probably dissent from what he says respecting the church of the present
day having virtually taken away the free agency of man by a formal decreeing of
his impotence in spiritual things. Bnt his proofs on this head are given in
another part of the volume, where they challenge refutation, and in the mean
time the burden of his doctrine on the general subject may be viewed apart
from his sentiments on this special topic.

man, and deprives this of all power of seeing any truth in the light ; wherefore
afterwards he reasons concerning spiritual things from the natural man alone,
which sees everything truly spiritual upside down. But the reason that mira
cles were done, before the coming of the Lord, was, because then the men of
the church were natural, to whom spiritual things, which are the internals of the
church, could not be opened ; for
it'
they had been opened, they would have
profaned them. Wherefore also all their worship consisted in rituals, which rep
resented and signified the internal things of the church
;
and they could not
v
be brought to perform those rightly, except by miracles
;
and that they could
not even by miracles, because in those representatives there was a spiritual in
ternal,
is
manifest from the sons of Israel in the wilderness, who, although they
had seen so many miracles in Egypt, and afterwards that greatest one upon-
mount Sinai, still, after a month of days, when Moses was absent, they danced
around a golden calf, and cried that that had brought them forth out of Egypt.
Very similar things were done by them in the land of Canaan, although they
saw the excellent miracles done by Elijah and Elisha, and at last those truly di
vine by the Lord. Miracles are not done at this day, especially for this reason,
because the church has taken away all free agency from man
;
and
it
has taken
it
away by this, that
it
has decreed that man can contribute nothing at all towards
receiving faith, nor anything to conversion, and in general to salvation (see above,
n. 464). The man who believes these things, becomes more and more natural,
and the natural man, as was said above, beholds everything spiritual upside
down, and thence thinks against it. The higher region of man's mind, where
free agency in spiritual things primarily resides, would be closed up, and spir
itual things, which have been, as
it
were, confirmed by miracles, would occupy
the lower region of the mind, which
is
merely natural
;
thus above this there
would remain falses concerning faith, conversion and salvation." —
T.
C. R. 501.
I
can scarcely deem
it
necessary to enlarge farther upon this point. My ob
ject has been, as generally elsewhere, to exhibit Swedenborg's genuine teachings
in contrast both with the erroneous presentation often made of them and with
the objections urged against them when rightly presented. In the department
we are now considering,
I
must regard his positions as intrinsically sound, and
so far as he declares the absence of miraculous attestation a distinguishing fea
ture of his mission,
it
commends itself more powerfully to my acceptance, and
that too not only for the reasons he has assigned, but because also of my full
conviction that no external miracles would be believed to be miracles by the
great mass of men in christian countries. They would infallibly be dealt with as
you deal with the remarkable occurrences which are referred to, but not appealed
to, as having taken place in regard to Swedenborg himself. While you have not
a
word to say by way of impeaching the testimony on which the facts are affirmed,
and while the sun in the heavens
is
not more obvious to the eye than the inference
is
to the reason, that
if
the facts are true they are supernatural —particularly those
relating to the disclosures made to the Queen of Sweden, and to the fire occurring
at Stockholm —yet they evidently have not the slightest effect on your mind in be
getting a conviction of what we maintain to be their tme character. And as
it
is
with yourself, so doubtless would
it
be with the majority of mankind. Nothing
short of a miracle within can make them believe in the occurrence of miracles with
out, and
it
is
not according to divine order to produce conviction in this manner.
The view which Swedenborg has given of this subject may be illustrated by
a supposition. Suppose, then, that Sir Isaac Newton, with all his scientific
attainments, had risen up in the days of Plato and announced to him the true
structure of the solar system, and in confirmation of the truth of his announce
ment, had been enabled to work one or more miracles. What would have been

the precise effect of the miracles, supposing them incontestable, on the mind of
the philosopher ? Would it not at once have produced a severe conflict between
what we may term the man ofthe senses and the man of the reason ?—a conflict ex
tremely unfriendly to the full exercise of his mental freedom. On the one hand
his senses are appealed to by a supernatural demonstration which he knows not
how to resist ; and ou the other, his educated belief and the whole current of
his convictions pronounce against the truth of the alleged theory. He is thus
indeed brought into " a strait betwixt two." He knows not what to think,
and probably at first fails to think at all. A kind of paralysis has fallen upon
his intellectual powers, an effect which in the parallel case Swedenborg des
cribes as a sort of suspending of a man's free agency —a phrase, however, which
is evidently not to be poshed to the utmost extremity of its import. Suppose
again that the astronomer consents to wave all appeal to the miracles, and pro
ceeds to unfold to the philosopher on purely scientific and mathematical princi
ples the grounds of his announcement. By a consecutive process of reasoning
he leads his mind along from step to step in the demonstration, submitting every
thing to the light of his understanding, till at length his hearer stands convinced
_
that the conclusion is irresistible —that the earth revolves arouud the sun, and
that the assumed law of gravitation is established beyond dispute. Which of
these modes of proof, the miraculous or the rational, is most valuable in itself?
Which state of mind the most desirable to be wrought in view of the truth pro
claimed ' Is there any room to hesitate in pronouncing a verdict? The mira
cles might be usefully available in arresting the philosopher's attention to the
proposed scientific development, if he were otherwise disposed to treat it lightly,
but it is plain that the internal evidence does the execution. From this illustration
you can at once see the grounds on which the receivers of Swedenborg's doc
trine easily and readily dispense with all miraculous testimony in support of
their truth. They feel the want of no higher miracle than they perceive in the
system itself.
XVI. Swedenborg's Intercourse with the Spiritual World. —" In the life of Swe
denborg various testimonies are given to the reality of his intercourse with the
spiritual world, and of his supernatural knowledge. From these the following
are selected as the most remarkable. The stories are contained in a letter of
Kant, the German Philosopher."
You go on briefly to recite these " stories," as you are pleased to term them,
namely, that which relates to Swedenborg's divulging to the Queen of Sweden
the private conversation which he had with her brother the Prince Royal of
Prussia shortly before his death, which she positively affirmed that she never
had repeated and which she was confident that he would not—that relating to the
discovery by Mad. Harteville of a lost receipt given her deceased husband before
his death, and which was found precisely as indicated by Swedenborg —and that
concerning the fire which Swedenborg declared, at the very time, to have broken
out at Stockholm, though he was 300 miles distant at Gothenburg, and the cor
rectness of which, as to the time and place of its commencement, the extent of
its ravages, and the period of its cessation, was minutely confirmed three or four
days after.

instituted a rigid inquiry and found nothing to countervail the testimony, you
remark :
" Now I shall not undertake to search out the hidden causes of such marvel
lous events. The means of doing this are not in my power. But what then ?
We have heard stories of fortune-tellers, jugglers, and dreamers, and persons
magnetized, quite as unaccountable and astounding as these. And who can
account for some of the feats of insanity ?—I would not undertake to disprove
the authenticity of the stories related of Swedenborg. And what then ? In all
ages wizards and witches have said and done things seemingly preternatural
and very astonishing. —Many such things have taken place; and they are cer
tainly marvellous phenomena. But the world in general, in harmony with the
sacred writers, have always looked upon persons practising such curious and
wonderful arts, as deriving their extraordinary power from a very suspicious
source. And who thinks of yielding himself to a fortune-teller, or a juggler, or
a magnetized woman, as a religious guide —a teacher of new doctrines, or new moral
precepts ?
'
He that hath a dream, let him tell a dream. And he that hath my
word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat, saith
the Lord.' And what are all the strange workings of the human mind above
referred to, whether preternatural or not, that they should turn off our affection
and confidence from the sure word of God i"—p. 142-144.
It is very certain that the parallel fails, in regard to Swedenborg, in one very .
important particular, and that is, that the " workings" of his mind whether pre
ternatural or not, so far from tending to " turn off our own affection and confi
dence from the sure word of God," tend directly to draw them to it and fix them
supremely upon it. The whole scope of his writings is to inspire the most lofty,
reverential, and devout conceptions of the Divine Oracles, as must have been
apparent to every candid reader who has perused the foregoing series of ex
tracts. This, methinks, should go not a little to do away the impression of
their having originated from the " suspicious source" to which you allude, for it
does not exactly consist with our ideas of diabolical suggestions that they should
aim to exalt to the highest possible pitch of spirituality and sanctity our notions
of the Scriptures of truth. The policy of infernal promptings would doubtless
be very different, and I must think that the undeniable fact that Swedenborg's
writings have a scope so pre-eminently scriptural renders his case an insoluble
enigma in all the common modes of accounting for it. Would the spirits of dark
ness and illusion dictate such a body of disclosures and doctrines as that of
which I have given so many specimens in the preceding pages ? Do you not
feel your mind pressed by the difficulties which crowd upon any supposition
but that of their divine origin and their absolute truth ? Why may not the sys
tem be true ? Can you adduce stronger reasons against it than it spontaneously
offers in its own support ? Is there not an astonishing plausibility in its devel
opments of our interior nature when viewed in connection with the interior pur
port of the Word ? Does it not involve a psychological problem which must be
solved before it can be intelligently rejected ? Can you not at least perceive so
much evidence in its favor as to account for the fact of its cordial reception by
multitudes of deeply reflecting and well-balanced minds ? And is a system that
wins its way to assent in such circumstances deserving of the unmeasured odi
um and contempt which has so often been showered upon it ? Do we not offer
reasons for our belief that are well worthy of profound consideration ? If Swe
denborg was not favored with spiritual intercourse how—how—how—shall the
amazing character of his developments be accounted for ? Insanity will not do

it.
What then remains but
the alternative of its truth
?
Can the mind rest with the least assurance or satis
faction on any other theory
?
But
I
have not yet done with the matter of miracles.
" But how singular
it
is, that the followers of Swedenborg should make use of
any such arguments as those above mentioned
!
Do they not know that Swe
denborg never attempted to support the truth of his pretensions
by
miraculous
evidence
?
Do they not know that he expressly discarded such evidence, saying
that
it
interfered with man's free agency
?
We should expect that Swedenbor-
gians would all be true to their Leader, as Professor Bush is, and would be care
ful not to resort to arguments which he rejected. The case of Christians
is
very
different
;
for their Lord and Saviour often appealed to his miraculous works a«
proof of his Messiahship. And such miracles as he wrought did indeed bear wit
ness of him, that the Father had sent him. And his disciples act consistently,
when they appeal to his works for the same purpose. But why should the dis
ciples of Swedenborg attempt to support his authority by such proofs as he de
clared to be inadmissible
?
Why should they wish to make proselytes by a kind
of evidence, which would work by compulsion, and would take away man's
free will
?
If
they yield to Swedenborg's authority in other things, why not in
this?"— p. 144.
We have here the most distinct intimation, that the " followers" of Sweden
borg endeavor to support the truth of his pretensions by miraculous evidence
and a grave lecture
is
read to them on the inconsistency of the proceeding. But
where has this been done
?
What single instance can you cite in which any
defender of his doctrines has taken any other ground than that which yon are
pleased to attribute to myself
?
T
know not one. They could not do
it
without
doing at the same time the most downright violence to the genius of the system.
That they refer to the extraordinary incidents alluded to —that they challenge a
refutation of the facts—that they hold them as offering a strong collateral con
firmation of his claim —
is
most true. But that they ever make these occurrences
prominent as " proofs to support his authority" —that they ever hold them forth
as a fundamental ground on which to urge belief —
is
most untrue. They deem
it
the glory of their credence that
it
can freely dispense with everything of the
kind. The fabric of their faith can stand firm with the aid of any such miracu
lous undershoreing. As nothing more, therefore,
is
requisite on this head than
a
simple negative to the statement of fact,
I
bring the present letter to a close with
the assurance of the respectful regards of

ous duties and relations, but simply as the expression of internal spiritual prin
ciples, whether of goodness and truth, or their opposites. The distinction often
made in other systems between what are termed credenda and agenda —things to
be believed and things to be done— almost wholly disappears in the doctrines of
the New Jerusalem. Truth, according to them, is addressed to the love-prin
ciple as much as to the understanding-principle, and is therefore as much to be
done as to be believed, and with the angels of the highest heavens, Sweden! lorg
informs us that truth is never a matter of reasoning, or even of conversation, but
always of practice. What you term therefore " the moral principles of his writ
ings" are in fact no other than the spiritual principles flowing from the constitu
tion of the Divine and human nature, and which characterise alike every portion
of his teachings and disclosures. No one part of them can be justly regarded as
embodying a " moral code" more than any other. By elevating the conjugal re
lation, for instance, as he does, into the very highest form of religious affection,
making its fundamental principle essentially the same with that which effects con
junction with the Lord himself, he must necessarily treat its opposite, not only
as the breach of a moral institute established by divine authority among men,
but as a violence done to the very inmost life and soul of celestial bliss. It is, in
fact, impossible to conceive anything of higher sanctity in matters of faith, than
what Swedenborg affirms of the actings of life in its various spheres of operation,
for the life is as the love, and the love is the ground-element in all the relations
which man sustains to his Maker.
The subject which now comes under discussion is undoubtedly one of the
greatest importance in its bearings on the general estimate formed of the system,
which has probably suffered more from impressions derived from this source
than from those originating in any other. It is a very easy matter, as experience
has shown,' by overlooking or suppressing the general scope of the work which
especially treats of this theme, and by disregarding the various qualifications,
the nice discriminations, and the solicitous cautions, which accompany his
teachings on this head, to present them under an aspect odious and shocking in
the highest degree ; and on the same principle the Bible itself might be made
out to be one of the most immoral books in existence. Nothing, however, is
plainer than that every man is entitled to the fairest exhibition of his real senti
ments on any subject —especially when those sentiments may be likely, on a
superficial survey, to subject him to censure, or to mar the effect of other incul
cations to which no exceptions are taken. The claim, in such cases, to the most
rigid justice would seem to be imperative in proportion to the evidence afforded
of an otherwise blameless character, of a devout spirit, of an upright aim, and
of a dominant salutary tendency in the general vein of a man's writings. If he is
one whose private and public life has been beyond reproach —whose grand ob
ject has been, as far as the testimony of his friends and the spirit of his works
ean attest, to promote the interests of solid virtue, to exalt the " blessed and only
Potentate" in the universal esteem of mankind, to lead all classes and degrees of
his fellow-men to prefer the glories and bliss of another life to the vain phantoms
of the present world, and to display before them the most constraining motives
to the pursuit, then it is obviously due, not only to the personal character of
such a man, but to the most sacred claims of Truth and Charity, represented in
him, that a peculiar tenderness shall be evinced towards his reputation, and that

no sinister impression shall be taken up respecting himself or his doctrines but
upon the most ample grounds. If any imputations are cast upon his teachings,
let him be heard to the fullest extent in his own defence ; let the most patient
audience be given to the statement which he makes of the elemental grounds and
reasons of every decision; and freely accord to him the advantage of every
sound distinction, of every just limitation, of every prudent reserve, of every
wholesome admonition, with which he would surround, and guard, and sanction
his positions. All this is the dictate of that common equity to which no Chris
tian mind can be insensible, and before a tribunal constituted of those with
whom such considerations shall weigh, the adherents of Swedenborg are per
fectly willing that his doctrines of Conjugiat and Scortatory love should be cited.
They regret to say, that, out of the bounds of the New Church, such a tribunal
they have not yet been so happy as to find, nor are they by any means sanguine of
being more fortunate in time to come. Still they are prompted by the duty of
expounding and the hope of vindicating the doctrines of their teacher on this as
well as all other points, and if they are discarded and denounced, it shall not be
our fault if this is done upon a false and mistaken view of their true character.
And let me here remark, in the outset, that some consideration is obviously
due to the state of mind in which this feature of Swedenborg's system has been
received by the great mass of those who adopt it. In view of the revolting
nature of the principles set forth in their prima facie character, or as usually
presented by opponents, it can scarcely be conceived that they should be insen
sible to the shock which they are calculated to give to all those settled precon
ceptions which they would naturally entertain on this department of the rigid
-morale of the Gospel. The individuals who have, one after another, yielded
their assent to the claims of Swedenborg, have been mostly from among the
members of what are termed evangelical churches, and who cannot fairly be
supposed to have adopted a more lax standard of morals on this subject than
the majority of their brethren. What reason then is there to believe that they
should fail to be equally outraged and scandalized by the naked assertion that
Swedenborg allows the " keeping a mistress and a concubine" with the mass of
the Christian community ? How were it possible that they should be blind to
the absolute atrocity of the doctrines charged upon Swedenborg on this subject,
provided the charge were true ? Is not the very supposition a virtual reflection
of the gravest character either upon their understandings or their moral princi
ples ! Does it not impeach them of a mental weakness transcending belief, or
of a moral corruption more to be detested than deplored ? Yet here is the obvi
ous fact, that these persons have actually embraced the system as a whole, and
that too in full view of all the alleged abominations on this score which it is said
to involve. We have therefore a problem to be solved. How is this admis
sion of the system to be explained consistently with a charitable construction
as to the mental and moral state of its subjects ? How 'have they been able to
overcome, to their own satisfaction, the force of objections which appear so
formidable to others— objections which they must have felt in all their weight ?
To say that they have been strongly drawn to the doctrines by certain of their
attractive features, and that, blinded by favoritism, they are morally unable to
perceive the enormities in question, is to impute to them the grossest mental
imbecility —a charge as unworthy the charity of those who make
it,

volting to the consciousness of those against whom it is brought. Some other
solution is imperatively called for, and, I am happy to say, can easily be given.
The process of conviction has been with them entirely rational and logical, and
their conscious experience will generally respond to their accuracy of the ensu
ing description of it.
(1.) On revolving the pages of Swedenborg and pondering the general import of
his revelations, they were compelled to the belief, from their intrinsic character,-
that they were of God. They became satisfied in their own minds that nothing
short of a supernatural opening of his spiritual senses could have enabled him
to make those astonishing disclosures of the interior-nature of man, and of the
spiritual world, which everywhere abound in his writings, and which they felt
to be so perfectly in accordance with the higher oracles of their own reason.
But this conviction they saw could not stand for a moment by th« side of the
suggestion, that the subject of a divine illumination —the selected instrument of
a message of truth to the world —should, at the same time, be left so far to the-
falsities of his own mind, as to be allowed to give forth to hi3 fellow-man, under
the alleged impulse of the Deity, a code of moral conduct on a particular subject,
founded upon the most erroneous principles, and tending to work incalculable-
mischief to the best interests of society. They could not conceive the possibility
that a messenger of Jehovah should be permitted to convert himself into a min
ister of sin, and under the very plea of elevating the law of the sexual relation
to a pitch of angelic purity, pander to the vilest corruptions of the human heart,
open the floodgates of the foulest iniquity, and eventually degrade man to a con
dition below that " in which God had created him or to which sin had sunk,
him." Could such sweet and bitter waters proceed from the same fountain ?
Just in proportion, then, to the strength of the evidence in favor of the divine
origin of his doctrines is the fulness of their assurance that no part of them can
be, when rightly understood and estimated, of the character usually attributed to the
" Scortatory Love." The supposition instantly confounds all their best ideas of
the counsels of Infinite Wisdom. That you felt yourself the pressure of the prob
lem on this head is evident from the drift of the following paragraph.
" Here in regard to the particular subject referred to, we meet with painful
disclosures — disclosures which it is difficult to reconcile with the justness and
purity of his general remarks on conjugal affection and the eonjugal state. Who
ean account for some things which he has written on this point, without sup
posing, what the Apostle speaks of as sometimes taking place, that Satan trans
formed himself into an angel of light, and that our author, amidst the throng of
angelic beings that surrounded him, was sometimes so far off his guard, or so
confused, that he actually mistook the influxes of evil spirits for those of good
spirits ? And we are sure that those infernal beings, who are enemies to all that
is pure and just and of good report, will be able very easily to dispose of all the
high and deep things, and all the right things, which Swedenborg has taught
respecting conjugal love, if men can only have the license which he gives for
the indulgence of their passions in other ways." —p. 148.
I say nothing at present of the solution you propose by which to account for the
apparent inconsistency between the general vein of his sentiments on the subject
of conjugal love and that which is evinced on the particular topic we are now con
sidering. You may ascribe
it,
if
you please, to the delusive agency of evil spirits

I
strenuously insist that the most latent implication,
that here
is
a formidable objection meeting us on the very threshold of the sys

the height of in
justice. Such an implication

undoubtedly conveyed'in the entire absence of
all allusion to any reasonings or apologies they may have offered, or could be
supposed to offer, in behalf of their faith, as
if
nothing more were necessary to
satisfy the demands of truth than the naked statement of the objection.
(2.) Their conclusion on this head was vastly strengthened by what they actu
ally found to be the prevailing tone and spirit of his writings. They know not
how to conceive anything on this head more pure, more sacred, more holy,
Than the vein which pervades the entire mass of his voluminous expositions of
Scripture, and his other theological works. Referring the essence of all true
religion to the actings of Divine love in the soul of man, he
is
perpetually aim
ing to impress upon him the indispensable necessity of putting away every evil
of heart and life which prevents the fullest conjunction with the Lord as the only
source of true blessedness, as the only preparation for heaven, as the only mode
of fulfilling the great ends of human destiny. The character formed under the
genuine influence of his doctrines cannot be otherwise than pure and heavenly
in an eminent degree, for the love of God cannot subsist apart from the love
of the neighbor, and the love of the neighbor must necessarily lay an ever
lasting interdict upon any single act or any course of conduct that
is
at war
with his truest and highest good. And yet
if
the representations often made by
his opponents are well founded, Swedenborg not only sanctions, but expressly
inculcates, principles diametrically opposite to all neighborly love, and calcu
lated to poison the fountains of domestic peace and purity, and to pour
a
deluge
of abominations over the bosom of society

reserve of certain conditions which would be a mere spider's web before the

?
Was not Swedenborg in possession of common
sense
?
Had not the ordinary principles which govern men in the adaptation of
means to ends

he were, what possible end could he have proposed to himself, in the labors

slur over this stupendous anomaly with the idle intimation of a brain disordered
by excess of study on mystical themes, or of a mind natively given to dreaming
rhapsodies. Such a solution denies the asserted intrinsic character of his other
works, and such a denial we know can proceed only from an ignorance which
in the eye of right reason utterly incapacitates a man from making it. We appeal
to the only true standard o£ judgment— the writings themselves. We challenge
the production of a single sentence from his voluminious composures on every
other subject of doctrine and duty which goes to relax the bonds of wholesome
restraint on the passions, or to weaken the sentiments of the most rigid virtue.
If our position on this point be unassailable, then we demand that some rational
solution be given of the phenomenon of a strain of teaching so wholly at war
with everything else that has proceeded from his pen, and so outrageously ab
horrent to every better feeling of the Christian bosom. We urge this demand as
founded upon an obligation that presses universally and equally upon all good
men. The claims of Truth are of no restricted application. If Emanuel Swe-
Uenborg, in the great body of his writings, has but reasserted the eternal Truth
of Jehovah, it is vain to suppose that those who are termed his " followers" are
alone concerned in them, or that it devolves upon them only to attempt to recon
cile their apparent inconsistency with other truths or principles regarded as set
tled beyond debate. If, as I affirm with all assurance, this wonderful man, in
the general drift of his doctrines and developments, has spoken to the world
what God, by inward teaching, spake to him —
if,
as
I
again affirm, you are una
ble to invalidate the essential verity or to gainsay the ineffable importance of
what he has uttered—then
I
appeal, reverend sir, unhesitatingly to the tribunal
of your own bosom, and call upon you to make common cause with me in
clearing up every apparent discrepancy between what he has taught, and what
he ought to have taught.
I
have no deeper concern in this matter than you have.
Swedenborg has said nothing to me which he has not said to you. From the
bonds of this obligation you can be freed only by the most clear and intelligent
assurance of the fallacy and insanity of his claims to
a
divine mission
;
and this
assurance can never be reached but by means of
a
thorough and searching exa
mination into the real character. of these claims. Of the result of such an examina
tion, even in your own case,
1
have no fear. In nothing
is
my confidence stronger
than in the conviction, that no candid and enlightened mind can really and truly
understand the system, and yet reject it. The grand difficulty
is
in persuading
men to bestow upon
it
sufficient attention to enable them to master its principles,
which, unless they do, they will reject the details as a matter of course.
(3.) In addition to the foregoing evidence of & presumptive kind, the practical ef
fect actually wrought upon their own minds by Swedenborg's presentation both
of the nature and consequences of all illicit sexual indulgence confirmed amazing
ly
their faith in its truth.
It
must indeed be admitted that this effect can only be ex -
pected to follow where the conviction has taken root that the law
of
connection
between character and destiny as developed by Swedenborg
is
indeed founded in
the very elements of our nature. But of this they usually become assured before
entering upon the close study of the Conjugial and Scortatory doctrines. When
they do this, with the requisite pre-acquaiutauce with the system,

impossible
for language to describe the horrifying effect produced upon them by the fearful
unveiling of the doom that awaits the transgressor in the life beyond death. If

they had ever wavered for a moment before, they are fixed beyond deliberation
now. So profound is the philosophy of sex as nnfolded in these wondrous pages
—so clear is the discovery of the celestial origin ana the pre-eminent sanctity of
the conjugal principle—that they see beyond question that everything opposed
to it must of necessity proceed from hell as its source and lead to hell as its issue.
Its very soul and essence and acting is all hellish. And with their general views
of the relation between the present and the future life can they but be keenly-
alive to the practical impression resulting from such developments as he makes
of the consequences ? As the true measure of every evil is the preciousness of
the good to which it stands opposed, the bare thought of doing violence to a
principle which lies so near to the very life of the heavenly beatitudes strikes
an ineffable awe upon their spirits, and makes them shudder as overthe opened
pit of perdition when tempted to parley with passion. i
In all this, I beg you to be assured, I am merely exhibiting what will be uni
versally affirmed, by the adherents of Swedenborg, to be the native and legiti
mate effect of his teachings on the point in question. It is impossible that
it.
should be otherwise,
if
they really believe what they profess to believe respecting
the condition of human spirits in the other life, as the inevitable result of char
acter and conduct in the present life. If you are at
a
loss to conceive it,
it
can
only be from a failure to apprehend, as they do, the overwhelming evidence of
the truth of these revelations viewed as a whole.
Such
I
believe to be, in the main,
a
correct exhibition of the process through
which all those have passed who now stand forth as the avowed receivers of
what we venture to denominate the Heavenly Doctrines proclaimed by Sweden
borg, and who assent as cordially to what he has taught on this particular topic,
as to any other part of the system. How far the considerations cited are enti
tled to weigh,
I
leave
it
u the candid censor to judge. To me they appear to
possess great intrinsic weight.
I
am wholly unwilling to admit the virtual im
plication, that the members of the New Church are incompetent to feel the force
of the objections urged, or that they have not been governed by adequate rea
sons in obviating them to their own minds. These reasons
I
have as yet how
ever but very partially presented, nor can
I
do anything like justice to the sub
ject without entering into a more detailed examination of those features of the
system to which exceptions are taken. This
is
fully warranted by the import
ance of the theme.
And let me here remark in the outset, that
I
wholly deny and repudiate the
charge constructively made in the inuendos respecting the immodesty and in
decency of Swedenborg's style in treating of this subject. From some sentences
in your own and Dr. Pond's work the uninstructed reader would infer, that the
treatise was marked by a baldness and grossness of language outrageously re
volting to the refined and virtuous ear. Nothing can be farther from the truth.
Indeed
I
cannot well conceive the possibility of
a
more faultless mode of treat
ing the subject than Swedenborg has evinced. There
is
a
delicacy of tact— a
studied chasteness of phrase —a felicity of allusion where plainness of speech
would be offensive —that
I

is
paralleled by any other writer. The

is
undoubtedly of a peculiar character, but

garded as the " head and front of his offending," that he has said anything what
ever on the theme. But why shall this be a tabooed subject in a scheme of theol
ogy and morality so comprehensive as that of Swedenborg ? Does it not in
volve questions of the most momentous bearings upon the interests of religion
and sound morals ? Is there any form of evil more rife in all communities than
those which grow out of the relation of the sexes ? Is not a fearful lesson on
this subject taught to every man who walks the streets of our great cities afler
night-fall ? And is not a light estimate of the true nature and ends of the conju
gal principle evermore at the bottom of these abominations ? How shall the
root of the evil be reached but by an impressive display of the pre-eminent and
inviolable sanctity of the relation of the sexes as founded upon the law of their
creation ? Such a discovery Swedenborg has made. He has elevated the love
of man and woman from the sensual to the spiritual, and even celestial, degree of
affection, and brought it into the closest affinity with the principle that conjoins
the soul to the Lord himself. He has clothed it, in fine, with all the sacredness
pertaining to the highest religious actings of the mind, and in so doing has pre
sented a standard by which to judge of the moral character of its least violation.
And is not this the true method of procedure ? Is not the conviction of sin
wrought by the knowledge of the law ? Is there any mode of displaying the
true character of evil so effectual as that of arraying over against it the good to
which it is opposed ? Or, on the other hand, can the claims of any form of good
be, by any means, so powerfully set forth as by contrasting it with its opposite
evil ? Are not the blessings of peace most loudly proclaimed by the horrors of
war—the value of freedom by the bitterness of bondage —the advantages of
temperance by the woes of ebriety—the beauty of benevolence by the deform
ity of selfishness —the excellence of justice by the foulness of wrong —and so,
vice versa, of the whole catalogue ? Why then shall not the Christian moralist be
permitted to depict the hideousness of lust and debauchery by contrasting it in
like manner with the superlative loveliness of a chaste and pure and well-ordered
intercourse between the sexes ? Or why, on the other hand, shall he not be al
lowed to commend the angelic attributes ofa true conjugal love by exposing the
infernal quality and infinite mischiefs of all scortatory promptings ? This is
what Swedenborg has done. His grand aim is to show that the conjugal prin
ciple is from heaven and essentially allied to its highest bliss, while everything
opposed to it is from the pit of hell and fraught with its direful and loathsome
influxes. Is this wrong ? Is it a fair ground of impeachment ? Has the theme
no claims upon the profoundest consideration of good men ? But could he or

delicacy, would inhibit the free exposure of the intrinsic nature and the baleful
effects of licentious indulgence ? Must the physician staud aloof from the " put-
rifying sore" because the sight of it is disgusting, or because the removal of the
bandage would offend any other sense .' If Swedenborg is condemned for his
bold and explicit utterances on this subject, let it be shown that the root of the
evil can be reached in any other way. And before the charge of grossness of
phrase is preferred, let it be shown that if the thing is to be treated at all it would

ingly affirm, that there is nothing more objectionable in his phraseology than in the sub
ject-matter itself, and that this is pre-eminently worthy of being treated distinctly
and emphatically in the great doctrines of faith and life. I am compelled, there
fore, to regard all insinuations about a revolting baldness and indecency in his
expressions —all pretences to the necessity of suppressing his own ipsissima verba
—all intimations of the danger of defilement by coming in contact with his dis
closures —as a positive slander and defamation, as intended to create an odium
for which there is no sufficient ground. And I must be permitted to remind the
authors of such intimations, that it is as much a command of the decalogue
that " thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor" as it is that " thou
shalt not commit adultery." The effect of all verbal exhibitions of this subject
is generally governed by the state of mind of the reader. " To the pure all
things are pure," but to the prurient imagination all things are defiled. Even
the sanctity of holy writ will not prevent some minds from feeding their
depraved fancies upon the images suggested by the language employed
in
it.
How much more then in the case of a merely human writer, how
ever pure his inward thought, and however free from any prompting but
that of stern fidelity to the sense of duty? If the parallel do not degrade the
gravity of the theme, Swedenborg
is
entitled to say in the words of one of
Shakespeare's dramatis persona —" an' wrong thinking do not wrest true speak
ing, my words will offend nobody." Why
is
not the same charge brought
against other writers who have treated the subject of sexual morality
?
Is
it
not because they have for the most part been silent respecting this department
of
it
?
And yet
is
it
a point on which silence
is
to be commended
?
If
not,
let those who are constrained to speak " show a more excellent way" of speak
ing than Swedenborg has evinced. Let them not take the credit of shunning his
alleged faults, while those very faults arose from the discharge of
a
duty which
they forbear to perform.
The claims of justice and truth compel me to advert to another feature of your
strictures on this head. You say that you feel required to exhibit the views of
Swedenborg with some particularity
;
and that in doing this you shall exhibit
his own language, except when decency absolutely forbids
it
(decency does not
forbid
it
at all). You then observe, —" The citations are made from his work on
Scortatory Love."
Now as you could not but have known that there
is
no separate work of his
bearing this title—that
it
is
an integral part of the general treatise on " Conjugial
Love" —allow me to ask, whether you could have felt yourself absolved, in fair
ness, from giving to your reader some intimation of this fact
?
Were you at
liberty, in foro conscientiae, to leave him in total ignorance of the nature, design,
and relations of that treatise, and to deprive the author of the advantage that
might accrue from
a
clear and accurate understanding of the object he had in
view in writing
it
?
Does this procedure savor more of the frankness and can
dor of a Christian censor, or of the sinister spirit of an unscrupulous opponent,
who would overwhelm with obloquy what he regards with aversion
?
Suppose
the case made your own—should you not protest against the manifest unfair
ness of such a garbled and distorted exhibition of your views as would be
made by violently dislocating one part of your argument from another, and sup
pressing

your scope ? Yet this is precisely the effect of dealing as you and others have
done with Swedenborg's doctrine on the relation of the sexes. That you have
intended to do him injustice, I do not assert ; but still injustice has been done,
and this makes it necessary for me to endeavor to re-poise the scales by gohig
into a somewhat fuller display of his genuine teachings than would otherwise be
called for.
The general title of the work in question is— "The Delights of Wisdom con
cerning Conjugial Love : after which follow the Pleasures of Insanity concerning
Scortatory Love."* It is palpably one work treating its main subject under two dis
tinct heads, just as a writer might indite a treatise on Temperance and divide it
into two branches, the one treating of the blessings of Temperance, and the
other of the miseries of Intemperance. You can easily perceive that if the
author, in the course of his discussion, should perchance have intimated that
when a man would drink, at all events, if no inducement he could hold out
would persuade him to abandon his cups and become a sober man, it were
better that he should drink wine than brandy —nothing could be more unjust in
an opponent than on this ground to represent the writer as an advocate for the
use of intoxicating liquors, and in order to prove it should quote the latter part
of his work without alluding to the former, or giving the reader any intimation
of its existence. It may indeed be a question in casuistry how far it were proper
in such cases even to speak of anything short of total abstinence, but it is evi
dently calumnious, on this ground alone, to charge a writer with abetting the
very vice which it is the grand object of his work to arrest, and that mainly by
a powerful exhibition of the opposite virtue. Yet this is a perfect parallel to the
measure which has been dealt out to Swedenborg in view of his enunciations
on the subject of Scortatory love.
But to return to the book. The edition now lying before me (Lond. 1841) con
sists of 430 pages, of which 344 aye devoted to Conjugial Love, and the remain
der, 86 pages, to Scortatory Love.f The latter part, therefore, bears comparatively
a small proportion to the former, yet it is an integral and inseparable portion of
it,
and this fact ought always to be made known to those who are appealed to
by any statements or remonstrances in regard to
it,
and whose prejudices
it
is
intended to enlist against it. The truth gains nothing in the end by such palpa
ble infractions of its own laws, and justice outraged by controversial tricks will
be sure to make heavy reprisals at last.
It
would have given me pleasure could
I
have managed this part of my reply without reminding you of so injurious
an omission in your statements and strictures on this head.
As
I
have already remarked, the scope of the entire treatise
is
to heighten to
the utmost our estimate of the nature and ends of the marriage relation by
a
most elaborate development of the interior principles on which
it
rests.
It
is
for the most part occupied with a profound exposition of the laws which govern
the union of the sexes.
It
sets the divine institution of marriage in its true light.

chaste love subsisting between one husband and one wife, originates in the mar
riage or conjunction of good and truth ; that it corresponds to the marriage of
the Lord and his Church ; that it is thus love celestial, spiritual, holy, pure, and
clean, in a pre-eminent degree ; and that it is the foundation of every species of
heavenly love and affection, with all their innumerable felicities. But I shall
feel at liberty to demand special attention to his own language in propounding
the doctrines which he has given forth to the world on this point. It is proper
that the Christian community should at least know what he has actually ad
vanced in his writings relative to the general subject of Conjugial Love, since
the soundness of his doctrines here must first be disproved before any headway
can be made against the general principles embodied in the Scortatory Love. As
my object is simply to exhibit a perfectly faithful view of what Swedenborg
has taught, not in one place or one work only on this subject, I shall not deem
it necessary to draw my extracts solely from the single volume in question.
" The reason why none can be principled in love truly conjugial but those
who receive it from the Lord, that is, who come directly to him, and by deriva
tion from him live the life of the church, is, because this love, considered in its
origin and correspondence, is celestial, spiritual, holy, pure, and clean, above
every love implanted in the angels of heaven and the men of the church ; and
these its distinguishing characters and qualities cannot possibly exist, except
with those who are conjoined to the Lord, and by him are consociated with the
angels of heaven ; for these shun extra-conjugial loves, which are conjunctions
with others than their own proper conjugial partners, as they would shun the
loss of the soul and the lakes of hell; and in proportion as married partners shun
such conjunctions, even as to the libidinous desires of the will and the intentions
thence derived, so far love truly conjugial is purified with them, and becomes
successively spiritual, first during their abode on earth, and afterwards in
heaven. The reason why none can be principled in spiritual conjugial love, but
those who are of the above description by virtue of conjunction with the Lord,
is, because heaven is in this love ; and the natural man, whose conjugial love
derives its pleasure only from the flesh, cannot approach to heaven, nor to any
angel, no, nor to any man principled in this love, it being the foundation love of
all celestial and spiritual loves." — C. L. 71.
" That marriage is heaven, and that adultery is hell, cannot be better seen
than from their origin. The origin of love truly conjugial is the love of the Lord
towards the church, whence the Lord is called, in the Word, the Bridegroom,
and Husband, and the church bride and wife : from this marriage the church is
a church in general and in particular; the church in particular is the man in
whom the church is : hence it is evident, that the conjunction of the Lord with
the man of the church is the very origin of love truly conjugial. But how that
conjunction can be the origin shall also be explained : the conjunction of the
Lord with the man of the church is the conjunction of good and truth ; from the
Lord is good, and with man is truth; and hence is the conjunction which is
called the heavenly marriage, from which marriage exists love truly conjugial
between two married partners, who are in such conjunction with the Lord :
hence it is first evident, that love truly conjugial is from the Lord alone, and with
those who are in the conjunction of good and truth from the Lord : inasmuch as
this conjunction is reciprocal, it is described by the Lord, that '
They are in Him
and He in them' (John xiv. 20). This conjunction or this marriage was thus esta
blished from creation : the man [vir] was created to be the understanding of truth,
and the woman \_fmmina\ to be the affection of good, consequently the man to
be truth and the woman good ; when the understanding of truth, which is with
the man, makes one with the affection of good, which is with the woman, there
is a conjunction of two minds into one ; this conjunction is the spiritual mar
riage, from which descends conjugial love : for when two minds are conjoined to
be as one mind, there is between them love, and this love, which is the love of

spiritual marriage, whilst it descends into the body, becomes the love of natural
marriage. That this is the case, any one may, if he be willing, clearly perceive :
the married pair, who interiorly as to their minds love each other mutually and
interchangeably, also love each other mutually and interchangeably as to their
bodies : it is well known, that all love descends into the body from .the affection
of the mind, and that without that origin not any love exists. Now inasmuch
as the origin of conjugial love is the marriage of good and truth, which marriage
in its essence is heaven, it is manifest that the origin of the love of adultery is
the marriage of evil and the false which in its essence is hell. The reason why
heaven is marriage, is, because all who are in the heavens are in the marriage
of good and truth ; and the reason why hell is adultery, is, because all who are
in the hells, are in the marriage of evil and the false : hence it follows of conse
quence, that marriage and adultery, are as opposite to each other, as heaven
and hell."— A. E. 983.
" They who are in love truly conjugial, after death, when they become angels,
return into youth and adolescence; the males, however worn out with age, be
come young men ; and the wives, however worn out with age, become young
women ; each conjugial partner returns into the flower and into the joys of the
age in which love conjugial begins to exalt the life with new delights, and to in
spire sportiveness for the sake of prolification : into this state, first exteriorly,
afterwards more and more interiorly to eternity, comes the man who had fled
adulteries as sins, and was inaugurated by the Lord into conjugial love whilst he
lived in the world. Inasmuch as they are always growing young more interi
orly, it follows that love truly conjugial increases and enters into its delights and
satisfactions, which were provided for it from the creation of the world, and
which are the delights and satisfactions of the inmost heaven arising from the
love of the Lord towards heaven and the church, and thence from the love of
good and truth between each other, from which loves is derived every joy in the
heavens. The reason why man thus grows young in heaven, is, because he
then enters into the marriage of good and truth, and there is in good an effort of
continually loving truth, and in truth there is an effort of continually loving good,
and then the wife is good in its form, and the man is truth in its form : from that
effort man puts off all the severity, sadness and dryness appertaining to age, and
puts on the liveliness, gladness and freshness of youth, from which the effort
lives and becomes joy. It has been told me from heaven, that they have then
a life of love, which cannot otherwise be described, than as being the life of joy
itself." —-4. E. 1000.
" The chastity of marriage exists by a total abdication of whoredoms from
a principle of religion. The reason is, because chastity is the removal of un-
chastity ; it being a universal law, that so far as any one removes evils, so far a
capacity is given for good to succeed in its place ; and further, so far as evil is
hated, so far good is loved; and also vice versa; consequently, so far as whore
dom is renounced, so far the chastity of marriage enters. That conjugial love
is purified and rectified according to the renunciation of whoredoms, every one
sees from common perception, as soon as it is mentioned and heard ; thus be
fore confirmation : but as all have not common perception, it is of importance
that the subject should also be illustrated in the way of proof by such conside
rations as may tend to confirm it. These considerations are, that conjugial love
grows cold as soon as it is divided, and this coldness causes it to perish ; for the
heat of unchaste love extinguishes it ; as two opposite heats cannot exist to
gether, but one must needs reject the other, and deprive it of its potency. When
ever therefore the heat of conjugial love removes and rejects the heat of scorta-
tory love, conjugial love begins to acquire a pleasant warmth, and from a sen
sation of its delights to bud and flourish, like an orchard and garden in the time
of spring ; the latter from the vernal temperament of light and heat from the sun
of the natural world : but the former from the vernal temperament of light and
heat from the sun of the spiritual world."— C. L. 147.

love directed to several, and contracted with several of the sex; whereas conju
gial love is only directed to one, and contracted with one of the sex. Moreover,
love directed to several and contracted with several is a natural love, for it is
common to man with beasts and birds, which are natural ; whereas conjugial
love is a spiritual love, and peculiar and proper to men, because men were
created, and are therefore born to become spiritual ; wherefore so far as man be
comes spiritual, so far he puts off the love of the sex, and puts on conjugial
love."—C. L. 48.
.
" But no others come into this love, and can be in
it,
except such as come to
the Lord, and love the truths of the church, and practise its goods. The reason
of this is, because monogamical marriages, which are of one husband with one
wife, correspond to the marriage of the Lord and the church, and because such
marriages originate in the marriage of good and truth. Hence
it
follows, that
conjugial love with man is according to the state of the church with him." —
C. L. 70.
" The Christian conjugial principle alone
is
chaste. Christians, in case they
marry more wives than one, commit not only natural, but also spiritual adul
tery."— C. L. 142.
The question now arises, are these principles sound
?
Is such in fact the
essential nature of Conjugial Love
?
Are you prepared to deny or dispute a
single position here advanced
?
If
not—
if
the ground-work
is
unassailable —then
I
would ask
if
what follows respecting the opposite of this love be not equally
sound and impregnable
?
'' Scortatory love
is
opposite to conjugial love, as hell
is
opposite to heaven."
— C. L. 429.
" The delights of conjugial love ascend to the highest heaven, and join them
selves in the way thither and there with the delights of all heavenly loves, and
thereby enter into their happiness, which endures for ever
;
the reason is, be
cause the delights of that love are also the delights of wisdom. But the pleas
ures of scortatory love descend even to the lowest hell, and join themselves in
the way thither and there with the pleasures of all infernal loves, and thereby
enter into their unhappiness, which consists in the wretchedness of all heart-
delights
;
the reason is, because the pleasures of that love are also the pleasures
of insanity." — C. L. 294.
" Forasmuch as adultery
is
hell with man, and marriage
is
heaven with him,
it
follows, that in proportion as man loves adultery, in the same proportion he
removes himself from heaven, consequently that adulteries shut heaven and
open hell
;
this they do in proportion as they are believed to be lawful, and are
perceived as delightful above marriages
;
wherefore the man who confirms adul
teries with himself and commits them from leave and consent of his will, and
is
averse from marriages, shuts heaven against himself, until at length he does
not believe anything of the church or of the Word, and becomes altogether
a
sensual man, and after death an infernal spirit; for, as was said above, adultery
is
hell, and hence an adulterer
is
a
form of hell. Inasmuch as adultery
is
hell,
it
follows, that unless man abstain from adulteries, and shun and be averse from
them as infernal, he closes heaven against himself, nor can he receive the least
influx thence; he afterwards reasons that marriages and adulteries are similar,
but that marriages are to be guarded in kingdoms for the sake of order, and the
education of the offspring
;
and that adulteries are not criminal, inasmuch as an
offspring
is
born from them equally as from marriages, and that they are no in
jury to women, because they can endure them
;
and further, that by them the
procreation of the human race
is
promoted
:
not knowing that such reasonings,
and similar others in favor of adulteries, ascend from the Stygian waters of hell,
and that the libidinous and bestial nature of man, which he has inherent from
nativity, attracts and sucks them, as a hog does the filth of
a
dunghill, with
delight."— A. E. 982.

" Man is born into the love of evil and the false, which love is the love of
-adultery, and this love cannot be converted and changed into spiritual love,
which is an image of God, and still less into celestial love, which is a likenes*
of God, except by the marriage of good and truth from the Lord, and not fully
except by the marriage of two minds and of two bodies. Hence it is evident
whence it is that marriages are celestial and adulteries infernal ; for marriage is
an image of heaven, and love truly conjugial an image of the Lord; and adul
tery is an image of hell, and the love of adultery an image of the devil : love
conjugial also appears in the spiritual world in form as an angel, and the love of
adultery in form as a devil. Reader, treasure this in thy mind, and inquire-
whether it be true when thou livcst a man-spirit after death, and thou wilt
see."— A. E. 984.
Such is an extremely general and cursory view of Swedenborg's teachings its
to the intrinsic character of these opposite and antagonist loves. In his mode of
presenting them, they cannot possibly be viewed apart from each other. To
pretend to exhibit a correct idea of his sentiments on the subject by quoting de
tached portions of the latter treatise, without affording any hint of the purport
of the former, would be as clamant an act ofinjustice as to adduce a dozen sen
tences from the latter part of the work on '' Heaven and Hell," containing a de
scription of the hells, and to palm them upon the world as affording a specimen
of his ideas oiheaven. What could be imagined more utterly at war with all the
dictates of Christian equity ?
Have we then, thus far, encountered anything on this subject that can
justly be deemed open to censure ?—anything which goes counter to the laws of
a sound and irreproachable morality ? Has he given an overwrought estimate
of the sanctity of what he terms the " conjugial "
principle, and of the marriage
relation which is founded upon it ? Has he either too darkly, or not darkly
enough, colored the portrait of the opposite principle in its essence and ac
tings ? Do not our inmost minds respond to the substantial truth of his represent
ations ? If the one principle be angelic and heavenly, must not the other be
devilish and hellish ? And is it any disparagement to this view, that he draws
his sanctions, on either head, from the intrinsic nature of man viewed in reference
to this grand department of his being ? I am well aware that theologians are
prone to rest the stress of obligation to moral duties upon the naked authority of
the Divine law. The uttered will of Jehovah they seem to regard as the all-suffi
cient basis of every precept and prohibition, and any reference to the laws grow
ing by necessity out of our constitution as creatures, they are prone to look upon
as in some way derogatory to the honor of the Supreme Lawgiver. Jehovah's
legislative glory is virtually made the foundation of every claim upon human obe
dience, and little or nothing is thought of the grounds laid in the very structure of
our being for right feeling and action. Now it is to be known that, whether
sound or unsound, Swedenborg's theology is built throughout upon the laws of
creation. He knows nothing of mere abstract law —of simple authoritative volition—
as the basis of moral obligation. He shows a reason in the constitution of things
for every form of legal enactment proceeding from the Deity, and to this view
of the matter his advocates cordially assent. If the principle is unsound, they
demand it shall be shown in what respect. It is in their esteem a principle of
pre-eminent importance, and one, the fallacy of which, if it be fallacious, deserves
to be distinctly pointed out at the hand of their opponents. Yet, where has
the slightest attempt at this been made, notwithstanding the principle lies ax

the foundation of all that Swedenborg has taught on the subject of Conjngial
and Scortatory love ?
I must then, at this point, again repeat the question, whether we have thus
far met with anything that can be validly objected to on the score of a lax mor
ality, or of an erroneous exhibition of the physical and psychological principles
which underlie the whole subject ? Can the most critical inspection detect aught
in these principles which strikes at the root of any Scriptural precept bearing
upon the commerce of the sexes ? If so, I am eager to be informed wherein.
The reply will doubtless be, that although there may be nothing objectionable
in the principles thus far laid down, yet as we proceed to the sequel we come
upon doctrines and applications of quite another aspect and fraught with the
most pernicious results so far as they are acted upon. This would certainly be
a well founded charge if in what you say of his allowance of mistress-keeping,
you had conveyed to your reader a correct and fair impression of the real drift
of his statements on that head. This, however, I shall hope to show is far from
being the case, notwithstanding that you have quoted, in some instances, his
own express words ; for a partial quotation from any writer may give but a par
tial view of his sense, and thus do him great injury. Now it is certain that the
tenor of your remarks conveys the impression that Swedenborg unqualifiedly
approves and sanctions a resort to pellicacy in the case of those who, while they
are from various causes prevented from entering into the marriage state, are
yet the subjects of strong sexual passions. But how is this credible in view of
what he is perpetually insisting upon, that " scortatory love is opposite to con-
jugial love as hell is to heaven" —that, " the impurity of hell is from scortatory
love" —that " adulterers become more and more not men, but demons" —that
such as are intent upon making a prey of female innocence are atrocious rob
bers and pirates —that heaven is entirely closed against them—that they come
into the most grievous hells —and that their lot after death is unspeakably terri
ble ? Is this the view of one who is at the same time an open advocate of licen
tiousness per se, and who industriously lays down a method of perpetrating sys
tematically and with impunity the very evils which he denounces as the out-
birth of hell and the seal of condemnation to its fiercest wrath ? Is the same
breath to be supposed to blow hot and cold in this manner at the same time ?
But how is his own language to be explained ? Does he not expressly say
that in cases where a man cannot contain, and where from various causes, he can
not marry at an early age, there is found a sort of " refuge or asylum" in a provi
sional compact of pellicacy with a single female, who is neither a virgin nor a
married woman ? This he undoubtedly does say, and in view of his language
I beg the reader to suspend his judgment till it be fairly weighed. Nothing can
be more just than that the words shall be interpreted, ifpossible, consistently with
what is said above, and with the obvious design and drift of the whole book. I
say ifpossible, because I do not scruple to affirm that with the evidence already ar
rayed before us, in regard to the dominant scope of the " Conjugial Love," no man
can justly impute to Swedenborg an intention to inculcate doctrines on this head at
war with good morals. A purpose so suicidal to his manifest aim, so absurd and
monstrous, cannot be attributed to a writer governed by rational motives, and
whose general enunciations on this and other themes, are marked by so pro
found a wisdom. If then he is absolved on the score of intention, the most that

can be said is, that he has erred in judgment, that he has been in some way mis
led in his casuistry, and that while aiming at a good end, he has still been be
trayed by a mistaken leniency towards human frailty, to lay down principles of
action contrary to the strict requisitions of the Gospel law. Even admitting this
to be the case, the purity of his intention is entitled to weigh somewhat in
abating the severity of the sentence that shall be pronounced upon his errors.
I do not say that it will excuse them, but it certainly goes to palliate them. But
I do not propose to rebut the force of the charge on this ground. I believe there
is a much stronger.
To a candid mind, I am persuaded, nothing can be more obvious than that
Swedenborg is here to be understood as speaking of providential permissions in
respect to worldly and natural men, who are not yet brought under the govern
ment of sound religious principle. As a sensible man, he could not be blind to
the fact, that there are those who are so immersed in sensuality, so obsequiously
led by their lusts, so deaf to the voice of conscience, and so dead to the senti
ments of piety, that, in their present state, they cannot be expected to feel the force
of the motives which address themselves to men who fear God and love right
eousness. Goaded on by powerful passion they cannot, because they will
not, control its actings. The inability does not excuse their indulgence, nor will
you find a sentence in Swedenborg which declares the innocence of such persons
in yielding to their impulses. Yet he uses the term cannot just as the sacred wri
ters use it in reference to precisely the same prompting : " Having eyes full of
adultery which cannot cease from sin j" " If a man cannot contain," &c. Here is
the simple recognition of a/act, which no one will deny, and which may be spoken
of as a fact without special reference to its moral character, much less without
any implied approval or sanction of it. It is a fact that there are such men ; it is
a.fact that they act from such instigations ; it is afact that the Divine Providence
does not prevent
it,
that is, that
it
permits
it
;
inasmuch as the world
is
not
governed on the principle of forced but of voluntary obedience. The Most High
does not command his lightnings to kindle upon the houses of ill-fame in our
large cities. He does not come forth " terrible from his holy places " and smite
the frequenter of these houses as he puts his foot upon the threshold. In accor
dance with the general scheme of his administration, He leaves every one to the
freedom of his own wTill, and to construct his destiny by forming his life ac
cording to his love. He holds out every variety of motive —admonitions,
warnings, invitations, threatenings —to induce him as a free rational being, to
" cease to do evil, to learn to do well"—to repent, believe, and be saved—but
he will not violently compel him to renounce iniquity and cleave to good. In
other words, he permits the evil to do evil.
The question now arises, whether the Christian moralist
is
warranted in recog
nizing the fact of these permissions, and in speaking of one form or degree of evil
as less heinous than another, when all are bad. The answer to this question will
determine the character of Swedenborg's teachings on the point under consider
ation.
If
it
be in no circumstances lawful to discriminate between the relative
degrees of moral turpitude, or to assume to show that one kind of vice
is
less
grievous and destructive of happiness than another, then doubtless a verdict

you should say to an incorrigible drunkard, "If you will drink in spite of every
remonstrance, then I beseech you to confine yourself to wine instead of a beve
rage more fully drugged with the poison of alcohol." Would you feel that you
were guilty of a moral wrong in uttering these words ? Would you deem it a
just imputation that you were hereby countenancing intemperance ? What
would be your crime in the case ? You tell the man that entire abstinence were
infinitely better than drinking at all ; you do all in your power to dissuade from
giving way to his appetite, but if in spite of everything he will still persist —if
neither the fear of God nor regard for man will weigh with him —would you feel
that you were wronging the interests of law or righteousness by saying to him
that of two evils he had better choose the least ? If you cannot save him entirely,
is it wrong to endeavor to save him as far as you can ? Now this is what I
understand to be the principle on which Swedenborg proceeds in treating the
subject of scortation. There is not the slightest approach to anything like an
absolute approval or countenance of licentious indulgence, and this is confirmed
by his own express declaration, that " these things are not said to those who are
able to restrain the heat of lust, nor to those that are able to enter into marriage
immediately upon their becoming mature." In the latter case he would undoubt
edly prescribe the apostle's remedy —"If they cannot contain, let them marry."
i>ut suppose a man who is not yet principled in religion is unable, from various
causes, to marry, while still the sexual stimulus is strong and urgent within
him, prompting to promiscuous indulgence ; although entire continence were
every way preferable, yet inasmuch as religious considerations do not bear
sway, may it not be said to him, or rather may it not be said of him, that it were
better that he should confine himself to one mistress, than that he should give
loose to his passions in roaming and unlimited amours ?
But I anticipate the obvious reply. We are to make no allowances —we are
to give no quarters to any form or degree of what is intrinsically evil —we have
nothing to do with drawing nice distinctions which will be perverted to the
accommodation of depraved men in the indulgence of their lusts. It is all evil
—evil only —evil continually. What have good men to do with the accursed
thing but to denounce and condemn it under every conceivable aspect ? This
has doubtless a plausible air, but it is not, I think, beyond question. I am at
any rate unable for myself to refuse assent to the soundness of what is contained
in the following paragraph.
" There are degrees of the qualities of evil, as there are degrees of the quali
ties of good; wherefore every evil is lighter and more grievous, as every good
is better and more excellent. The case is the same with fornication ; which, as
being a lust, and a lust of the natural man not yet purified, is an evil; but as
every man is capable of being purified, therefore so far as it accedes to a puri- -
fied state, so far that evil becomes a lighter evil, for so far it is wiped away;
thus so far as fornication accedes to conjugial love, which is a purified state of
the love of the sex, [so far it becomes a lighter evil] : that the evil of fornication
is more grievous, so far as it accedes to the love of adultery, will be seen in the
subsequent article. The reason why fornication is light, so far as it looks to con
jugial love is, because it then looks from the unchaste state wherein it is, to a
chaste state ; and so far as it gives a preference to the latter, so far it is also in it
as to the understanding; and so far as it not only prefers it, but also pre-loves
it, so far it is also in it as to the will, thus as to the internal man ; and in this
case fornication, if the man nevertheless persists in it, is to him a necessity, the
causes whereof he well examines in himself. There are two reasons which

render fornication light with those who prefer and pre-love the conjugial state ;
the first is, that conjugial life is their purpose, intention, or end ; the other is,
that they separate good from evil with themselves. In regard to the first, —
that conjugial life is their purpose, intention, or end, it has the above effect, in
asmuch as a man is such a man as he is in his purpose, intention, or end, and
is also such before the Lord and the angels ; yea, he is likewise regarded as
such by the wise in the world ; for intention is the soul of all actions, and cau
ses blamableness and unblamableness in the world, and after death imputation.
In regard to the other reason, —that those who prefer conjugial love to the lust
of fornication, separate evil from good, thus what is unchaste from what is
chaste, it has the above effect, inasmuch as those who separate those two prin
ciples by perception and intention, before they are in good or the chaste prin
ciple, are also separated and purified from the evil of that lust, when they come
into the conjugial state." — C. L. 452.
Now if the main principle here asserted be in itself a sound principle, why may
it not be said to be so ? If the judgment of God is according to truth, and it be
a truth that one evil is intrinsically greater than another, will He not so account
it ? Is it said that the Scriptures know no such distinction, but that all evil is by
them indiscriminately condemned, and that it is relaxing the vigor of the divine
law to make the slightest concessions to human infirmity, and especially to
build anything upon the fact that the Lord in his providence permits aught that he
has forbidden in his word ' But it is palpably impossible to get over the fact
that the Scriptures themselves do recognize the doctrine of permissions, and that
even the positive legislation of Jehovah among the Jews was, in several points,
ordered in reference to certain things which were in themselves evil, and which
were permitted with a view to the avoidance of greater evils. Indeed a stronger
term than permission is warranted by the facts of the case. It was a species of
winking at the prevalence of practices which were at the same time at variance
with the general scope of the divine statutes. Polygamy was in itself an in
fraction of the primitive ordinance of monogamical marriage. Yet polygamy
was tolerated, and express laws were enacted to regulate it. Divorce, except
for a single cause, was equally abhorrent to the true nature and ends of the
marriage institute, and yet a clement consideration of the " hardness of heart" of
that people led to an abatement of the original rigor with which the sacred cove
nant was enjoined. These are facts which it is impossible by any sophistry to
deny, and I adduce them to show that Swedenborg has powerful precedent to
plead when he makes providential permissions the basis of prudential suggestions
applicable to those who are not at present accessible to higher motives. It
avails nothing to say, in regard to these ancient allowances, that they are done
away under the gospel. Even conceding this, still the fact that they existed is
not done away, and never can be, and this fact proves the soundness of the
general principle ; for if polygamy and divorce for the reason intimated, are in
their own nature diametrically opposite to and destructive of the conjugal union,
they could no more have been allowed under the lav/ than under the gospel,
much less could they have been the subject of direct regulation on the part of
the Divine Lawgiver. The reasoning of Milton on this head in his " Doctrine
and Discipline of Divorce" I regard as absolutely unanswerable. Ke shows by a
process of moral logic too luminous to have been expected from any other poet
than himself, that to allow absolute sin by law, is against the nature of law, the
end of the lawgiver, and the good of the people, and therefore impossible in the

law of God. " Be it yielded," says he, " that in matters not very bad or impure,
a human lawgiver may slacken something of that which is exactly good, to the
disposition of the people and the times ; but if the perfect, the pure, the right
eous law, of God be found to have allowed smoothly, without any certain rep
rehension, that which Christ afterward declares to be adultery, how can we free
this law from the horrible indictment of being both impure, unjust, and falla
cious ?" " If the law allow sin, it enters into a kind of covenant with sin ; and
if it do, there is not a greater sinner in the world than the law itself."—" Did God
for this come down and cover the mount of Sinai with his glory, uttering in thun
der those his sacred ordinances out of the bottomless treasures of his wisdom
and infinite pureness, to patch up an ulcerous and rotten commonwealth with
strict and stern injunctions to wash the skin and garments for every unclean
touch ; and (yet) such easy permission given to pollute the soul with adulteries
by public authority, without disgrace or question ? No, it had been better that
man had never known law or matrimony, than that such foul iniquity should
be fastened upon the Holy One of Israel, the Judge of all the earth ; and such a
piece of folly as Beelzebub would not commit, to divide against himself and
prevent his own ends."—" The vigor of his law could no more remit, than the
hallowed fire upon his altar could be let go out. The lamps that burned before
him might need snuffing, but the light of his law never."
s All this I have cited to show that there is such a thing in the divine govern
ment as the kindly consideration of certain circumstances and conditions which
go to modify the character of moral actions, and to which we are not required
to be blinded by the fact that they are capable of perversion and abuse. Who
can suppose that the sufferance accorded to the Jews on the ground of " hardness
of heart" wa9 not sometimes abused under vain and injurious pretexts ? Yet the
concession was not thereby revoked. So in regard to an important item oc
curring in the above quotation from Swedenborg ;—" In this case fornication, if
the man nevertheless persists in
it,
is
to him a necessity, the causes whereof he well
examines in himself (in explorato apud ilium sunt)." Let this be viewed in its
connection with the context and

a

judge for themselves, and this

plainly hinted at in the expression —"the cau
ses whereof he well examines in himself." As Swedenborg regards him as a
natural man,
it
does not follow that the same reasons which satisfy him would
satisfy a spiritual man, but still his imagined causes go to relieve his conscience,
and he has not therefore the guilt of one who sins against light. The case
however
is
not mentioned by way of approval, but simply as an instance of the

it

done to the marriage tie in proportion as the fixed intention of marriage enters
into the act in question.
What then is more palpable than the truth of the principle, that there are
degrees in the evil of fornication ? And if such be the fact, cannot it be stated
by the moralist without weakening the sanctions of virtue or legitimating the
issues of vice ? The principle is undoubtedly capable of abuse—as what true
principle is not ?—but the abuse is not justly chargeable upon its simple enun
ciation. This is not necessarily responsible for the use that may be made of it.
He that will pervert it to the justification of his wrongs, does it at his peril.
The fact I believe to be that Swedenborg's teachings on this subject are not so
much designed to lay down rules of action as rides ofjudgment in regard to actions
having reference to the intercourse of the sexes. It is little else than a part of
his grand doctrine of Providence, upon the interior springs of which he has
poured a light never before accorded to the Christian world. In his treatise on
that subject he has shown, for instance, that the Mahometan religion was spe
cially raised up to accomplish important purposes of the Divine Wisdom in re
spect to the Oriental nations, more particularly in effecting the extirpation of
idolatries, which could never have been brought about but by a certain degree of
connivance at the doctrinal tenets embraced in that religion. But shall a Chris
tian teacher be precluded from laying open the laws of this providential econ
omy, because forsooth his readers might be led to suppose that he was sanction
ing the Koran and setting aside the Bible ? If one does not perceive somewhat
of the principles upon which the Lord proceeds in the ordering of his provi
dence in regard to the evils of evil men, controlling their conduct, while he still
preserves their freedom, such an one is not in a condition to pronounce upon
the purport of Swedenborg's doctrines in the work under consideration. He
cannot appreciate the light of intelligence with which his receivers know them
selves to be endowed in contemplating the great truths of the Divine order.
Their claims on this head may be arraigned of presumption and laughed to
scorn, but the perpetual hills may as soon be shaken by the breath of an infant
as the strength of their interior convictions be moved.
In relation to this whole department of the subject, the following remarks from
the Rev. J. H. Smithson's Letter to Rev. Mr. Gibbon, in refutation of his calumnies
against Swedenborg and his writings, will be seen by the candid reader to be pe
culiarly appropriate and striking ;—"Like a skilful physician, he marks and exam
ines every symptom of the dreadful disease. Those symptoms which are of a less
malignant character he particularly notes : upon these he rests his hopes that
the patient, if he follow the prescriptions given, will eventually return to spiritual
health and happiness ; and yet assures him, that otherwise the disease will con
tinue its ravages. Those symptoms, however, which are of a more grievous char
acter he especially points out, and warns the patient, that if they are not subdued
and removed, death—spiritual death—will follow ; for there is '
a sin unto death,
and '
a sin not unto death.' For the lust of fornication, as he states, is less griev
ous and deadly in proportion as it verges towards conjugial love, that is, towards
a regenerate state ; and it becomes more grievous and deadly in proportion as it
verges to adultery. Now this is precisely the point of view in which Sweden
borg places this subject ; and the physician and the disease exactly illustrate the
nature of the case. But who in his right mind, unwarped by prejudice, or not

actuated by a hostile predetermination to condemn, was ever known to allege
the grossest accusations against a physician for fully exploring the nature of a
disease, and discriminating between those symptoms which, with proper treat
ment, afford a reasonable hope of recovery, and those which infallibly prove that
the disease is destructive and deadly ? Does not the skill of a physician chiefly
consist in being able to make this most important discrimination, as well as in
pointing out the specific remedies to restore health and happiness ? The reme
dies in this, as in every other sinful case, are, as Swedenborg so repeatedly
shows, a. living faith in the Lord Himself, as the great Physician of souls, and
the exercise of fervent prayer and sincere repentance : these are the means by
which spiritual recovery and health can be established. Now those who would
allege the grossest accusations against Swedenborg on this head, are as absurd
and calumnious in their conduct, as those who would lay the grossest charges
against a physician because he discriminates between the more and less griev
ous symptoms of a complaint, and wisely prescribes according to the exigencies
of the case."— Intel. Repos. Nov. 1841, p. 495.
With these preliminaries let us look at a sentence which you have quoted
with the evident implication of its embodying an ethical enormity of the grossest
character. In order to present the subject fairly I cite at some length the con
text. The main object of the section is to show that pellicacy ispreferable to vague
amours, provided only one mistress is kept and she be neither a virgin nor a married
woman, audit be kept separate from conjugial love.
" I. The reason why only one mistress is to be kept, is, because if more than
one be kept, a polygamical principle gains influence, which induces in a man a
merely natural state, and thrusts him down into a sensual state, insomuch that
he cannot be elevated into a spiritual state, in which conjugial love must be.
II. The reason why this mistress must not be a virgin, is, because conjugial love
with women acts in unity with their virginity, and hence is the chastity, purity,
and sanctity of that love ; wherefore when a woman makes an engagement
and allotment of her virginity to any man, it is the same thing as giving him a
certificate that she will love him to eternity: on this account a virgin cannot,
from any rational consent, barter away .her virginity, unless in case of engage
ment respecting the conjugial covenant ; it is also the crown of her honor : where
fore to pre-seize it without a covenant of marriage, and afterwards to discard her,
is to make a virgin a courtezan, who might have been a bride or a chaste wife,
or to defraud some man, and each is hurtful. Therefore whoever takes a virgin and
joins her to himself as a mistress, may indeed cohabit with her, and thereby initiate her
into the friendship of love, but still with a constant intention, ifshe do not act the wanton,
that she shfdl be or become his wife. III. That' the kept mistress must not be a mar
ried woman, because this is adultery, is evident." — C. L. 460.
The sentence in Italics is that which you have quoted, and to which you ap
pend the remark that it is to be understood as a specimen of " the more free way
of thinking in spiritual things (more properly in carnal things) which Sweden
borg introduced."
Now nothing more is requisite than a candid perusal of the whole extract to see
that this is an exception to what is taught in its general scope. A man is not to
enter into a compact of pellicacy with a virgin-mistress for the reasons stated.
But ifhe does, the nature of the relation is changed. His cohabitation with her is
to be distinctly on the ground of intended marriage, and though the connection in
this case is by no means invested with the character of innocence, yet the sin
cere purpose of marriage does undoubtedly avail to bring it in the category of
the lighter forms of the evil, according to the distinctions laid down. But his

main drift in the section, as is evident from what follows, is to show that the
love of pellicacy is to be kept separate from conjugial love. " The reason why
the love of pellicacy is to be kept separate from conjugial love, is, because those
loves are distinct, and therefore ought not to be mixed together ; for the love of
pellicacy is love unchaste, natural, and external; whereas the love of marriage
is chaste, spiritual, and internal. The love of pellicacy makes distinct the
souls of two persons, and conjoins only the sensual principles of the body; but
the love of marriage conjoins souls, and from the union of souls conjoins also
the sensual principles of the body, until from two they become as one, which is
one flesh." " If the love of pellicacy becomes the love of marriage, the man
cannot, from any right, recede, without the violation of conjugial union ; and if he
does recede and marry another, conjugial love perishes from the breach of it. It
ought to be known that the love of pellicacy is held separate from conjugial love,
in that he does not promise marriage to the mistress, nor lead her into any hope
of marriage." Be it observed, however, that in all this he is speaking of the nat->
ural man under the influence of natural principles ; that heregards the whole thing
as intrinsically a form of evil ; and accordingly he winds up with saying ;—" Yet
it is better that the torch of the love of the sex should be kindled with a wife."
I must here be permitted to request that your eye may be turned back for a
moment to the second of the reasons given in the above quoted paragraph. It
is of the utmost importance as viewed in connection with Swedenborg'9 whofo
doctrine of scortatory love. You will see from it that he neither allows nor per-
tnits, in any possible circumstances, the wanton violation of female innocence.
No plea of necessity or expediency can avail for one moment to justify the spo
liation of the priceless pearl of maiden purity. To the same purpose he remarks
on a subsequent page, that " die defloration of a virgin without a view to mar
riage as an end, is the villany of a robber." The grounds of this emphatic rep
robation of the vile seducer exist in the fact that " virginity is not only the crown
of chastity, but it is also called the certificate of conjugial love, because a certi
ficate has relation to a covenant; and the covenant is, that love may unite them
into one man, or one flesh. The men themselves also before marriage regard
the virginity of the bride as a crown of her chastity, and as a pledge of conju
gial love, and as the very dainty from which the delights of that love are about
to commence and to be perpetuated. From these considerations it is manifest
that after the zone is taken away, and the virginity is sipped, the virgin becomes
a wife, and if not a wife, she becomes a harlot." Now I beg it may be consider
ed whether his actual prohibition on this score does not in fact strike at the root
of all his alleged allowances on every other. Do not his teachings on this
point carry with them the germ of an eventual superseding of even every appar
ent and reputed license that may be said to mark or mar the system ? If '' where
no wood is the fire goeth out," so there certainly can be no pellicacy where there
are no pellices, and where can they be found if there are no seductions ? But
seductions can never occur where Swedenborg's principles are acted upon, so
that whatever bane may be charged upon his precepts, they assuredly carry
their own antidote with them. How then can the indictment stand against him
of inculcating a lax morality on the score of the intercourse of the sexes ?
" But does he not sanction pellicacy ?" If so, how ? As to the general prop
osition, that pellicacy is preferable to vague amours, under the conditions

which he specifies, I would respectfully inquire if you do not yourself pro
nounce the same verdict. Does not your calm reason decide, that if there
is no rational ground to hope that the evil will be speedily entirely abol
ished, it would be infinitely preferable that the abandoned women in our popu
lous cities should forego promiscuous intercourse and confine themselves each
to a single paramour, rather than venally bestow themselves, as they do, upon
every vile solicitor ? And so, on the other hand, with the opposite party. I
admit of course that even this is worse than something better ; but is it not also
better than something worse ? Is there not in this a faint shadow of the conjugal
relation —something in a degree conservative of the radical principle of its love,
and which, with the full concession of its shortcomings, may still be regarded
with some measure of forbearance when the strength of the sexual impulse
and the political or social obstacles to marriage are taken into the account ? I
would not for the world advance a sentiment on this subject which could be
legitimately construed into a sanction of vice, but I am unable to perceive any
thing derogatory to the true character of Christianity in supposing it capable of
a certain kind and generous consideration of evils which have been vastly aggra
vated by factitious and accidental causes. May not the Gospel, as well as the
Law, evince some sympathy with human infirmities, and may not a benevolent
teacher of its doctrines, who has given so much evidence of speaking the
language of superhuman wisdom, be permitted to hint at a mode of mitigating
ills which cannot at be once eradicated, without exposing himself to the charge
of aiming at a total subversion of the laws of moral purity? Has he not shown
a higher estimate of those laws and traced them to a deeper foundation than
any other man ? Can he be a real enemy to the good which their observance is
calculated to produce ?
I have, I believe, in what precedes exposed to view those portions of Sweden-
borg's doctrine of pellicacy which are usually regarded as most exceptionable.
But I would deal with the utmost fairness by my readers, and shall therefore go
still more fully into the subject, and appeal to his candid judgment in the array
of the following propositions, for the most part in Swedenborg's own words :—
(1.)
" That it is not known what is the quality of scortatory love, unless it be
known what is the quality of conjugial love." Is not this a fact ?
(2.) "Jhat scortatory love is opposed to conjugial love." Is not this a fact?
(3.)
" That scortatory love is opposed to conjugial love, as the natural man
viewed in himself is opposed to the spiritual man." Is not this a fact ?
(4.)
" That scortatory love is opposed to conjugial love, as the connubial con

" That fornication is of the natural man." Is not this a fact ?
(10.)
" That fornication is lust, but not the lust of adultery." Is not this a fact ?
(11.)
"
That^with some men the love of the sex cannot be, without hurt, totally
checked from going forth into fomicatic*." Is not this a fact, when under
stood according to its evident import, viz. that a certain constitutional ap
petency is often attended with injurious effects, both physically and mentally,
when restrained from its natural mode of gratification ; which is palpably
all that is intended by fornication in this connection. " It is needless," says he,
" to recount the mischiefs which may be caused and produced by too great
a check of the love of the sex, with such persons as labor under a superabun
dant venereal heat ; from this source are to be traced the origins of certain bodily
diseases and of distempers of the mind, not to mention unknown evils, which
are not to be named. It is otherwise with those whose love of the sex is so
scanty, that they can resist the sallies of its lust; also with those who are at
liberty to introduce themselves into a legitimate partnership of the bed, while
they are young, without doing injury to their worldly fortunes, thus under
the first favorable impressions." He then alludes to the difficulties often
occurring on this score in the present world, " where matrimonial engagements
cannot be contracted till the season of youth is past, and where, during that
season, the generality live within forms of government, where a length of time
is required to serve offices, and to acquire the property necessary to support a
house and family, and then first a worthy wife is to be courted." And so all
along he gives peculiar prominence to the fact, that the most serious obstacles
to marriage exist with multitudes growing out of the governmental polities and
social systems generally prevalent. Yet still these multitudes are men. Now of
all these considerations we can only say, Valeant quantum valent —let them weigh
at much as they are entitled to weigh. It is said by the biographers both of Swift and
of Cowper that their mental diseases arose from this cause, and I believe that
physicians are often consulted by those for whom they see that marriage is the
proper remedy. Yet I do not plead any such necessity as an excuse for forbid
den indulgence, nor does Swedenborg speak of such a resort as exempting any
man from reaping the legitimate fruits of his conduct in the consequences of the
transgression of a general law. Still I do not know that it militates with the
higher and better movements of the Christian spirit to allow its due- weight to
every consideration which may fairly go to alleviate the criminality of moral acts.
The sexual passion is in most men exceedingly strong, and when the artificial
and corrupt institutions of society have interposed barriers to the lawful mode
of gratifying
it,
this fact would seem at least to dictate as mild
a
judgment as pos
sible of the infractions of a law the observance of which

made so much more
difficult by man than

constitution in which power and wealth are the all-prevailing and all-moulding
principles, and where man's higher interests and relations are systematically and
forcibly subordinated to the low, secular, and sensual aims of the worldly mind,
demand
a
charitable consideration.
If
we place ourselves in our author's circum
stances when he wrote we may form a juster estimate of what he wrote. On the
on« hand, he could not but be aware of the strength and urgency of the passion in
question, of which every man has probably
a

express. On the other, he looked abroad over the face of society and saw

numerous classes, that the resort to marriage was frequently next to impossible.
But a free scope to licentiousness is the destruction of the conjugial principle, and
the source of ineffable evils. Is there then no remedy ? God has implanted the
passion; man has virtually interdicted its legitimate gratification. The proper
exercise of religious principle would even in these circumstances impose the re
quisite restraint ; but this could not reasonably be anticipated in regard to the
great mass of men, for the very genius of the despotisms which are the occa
sion of the abounding of sexual immoralities is essentially adverse to the preva
lence of true piety. Yet the civil interests of all communities demand that some
remedy should be prescribed to the ravages of lust. In this condition of things,
with a broad survey and a benevolent consideration of the causes which were
mainly operative in producing the evil, Swedenborg comes forward, and in view
of the certainty that some men would be inaccessible to all higher motives to con
tinence, suggests an expedient, addressing itself to lower principles, but by which
a host of evils otherwise inevitable might be avoided, and the sacred con-
jugial germ, the jewel of the soul, still be preserved from utter extinction. In
doing this he speaks in the character of a Christian Montesquieu unfolding " the
spirit of" ethical " laws," and propounding to rulers measures to check as far as
possible the progress of a moral pestilence of the deadliest type. Freely conced
ing that something higher and better is infinitely desirable, yet who will say that
the remedy is worse than the disease, and who is entitled to denounce the pro-
pounder, while he simply contents himself with deploring abominations too
mighty for human conflict, because too deeply entrenched behind the bulwarks
reared around them by the traitorous servility of a false public sentiment which
decks itself with the name of delicacy. But to return to the propositions.
(12.)
" That therefore in populous cities public stews are tolerated." Is not
this a fact, and is anything more than the fact asserted ? I will give the whole
section. " This is adduced as a confirmation! of the preceding article. That
they are tolerated by kings, magistrates, and thence by judges, inquisitors, and
the people, at London, Amsterdam, Paris, Vienna, Venice, and Naples, and even
at Rome, besides many other places, is well known; among the reasons of this
toleration are those also abovementioned." This is all. There is no absolute
approval of the toleration, yet there is doubtless the implication of a latent sense
in the minds of the rulers of these countries that in existing circumstances this tol
eration is the least of two evils. And here it will be proper to recite the reasons
which Swedenborg specifies as assignable for the policy suggested.
" That in
kingdoms, where forms and orders of government prevail, matrimonial engage
ments cannot be contracted by many, till the season of youth is past ; for offices
are first to be served, and property is to be acquired necessary for the support of
a house and family, and then first a worthy wife is to be courted ; and yet in the
preceding season of youth, few are able to keep the springing fountain of virtue
closed up, and reserved for a wife; it is better indeed that it should be reserved;
but if this cannot be done on account of the unbridled power of lust, a question
occurs, whether there may not be an intermediate means, whereby conjugial
love may be prevented from perishing in the mean time. That pellicacy is such
a means, the following considerations advise : I. That by this means pro
miscuous inordinate fornications are restrained and limited, and thus a more1
constricted state is induced, which is more nearly related to conjugial life.

II. That the ardor of venereal propensities, which in the beginning is boiling hot,
and as it were burning, is appeased and mitigated ; and that thereby the lascivi
ous passion for the sex, which is filthy, is tempered by somewhat analogous to
marriage. III. By this means too the strength is not cast away, neither are
weaknesses contracted, as by vague and unlimited amours. IV. By this means
also disease of the body and insanity of mind, are avoided. V. In like manner
by this means adulteries, which are whoredoms with wives, and debaucheries,
which are violations of virgins, are guarded against ; to say nothing of such
criminal acts as are not to be named. VI. By pellicacy neither is access given to
the four kinds of lusts, which are in the highest degree destructive of conjugial
love, —the lust of defloration, the lust of varieties, the lust of violation, and the
lust of seducing innocences, which are treated of in the following pages. But
these observations are not intended for those who can check the tide of lust; '
nor for those who can enter into marriage during the season of youth, and offer
and impart to their wives the first fruits of their ability." — C. L. 459. Intimations
of this nature can of course be deemed little requisite to Christian men, who
have a deeper insight into the grounds and sanctions of moral obligation, but
think for a moment of the immense numbers of those who know no such re
straints, and whom yet it is so vastly desirable to have restrained by rational
checks.
How far these reasons have weight, is left for every one to judge ; but I know of
nothing in the treatise more likely to encounter reproach than this. In forming
an opinion it will be important to bear in mind his own cautionary remarks, that
" it is better that the fountain of ability should be reserved," and that what he says
is " not said to those who are able to restrain the heat of lust, nor to those who
can marry early." It is not therefore a general license, but a provisional expe
dient, founded upon contingent circumstances occurring under the Divine Pro
vidence, and which he regards as calling for adapted remedial measures of some
kind. That the evils which the measures contemplate are really of the most
stupendous magnitude, I think no one can deny. That the universal prevalence
of right religious sentiment and action would effectually abolish them, is equally
beyond dispute. But seeing such a state of things does not at present exist, and
is not soon to be rationally anticipated, the question is doubtless a fair one in
morals, whether a Christian teacher is not at liberty to suggest, under due limita
tions and cautions, a palliative remedy which, though it does not accomplish all
that could be desired, does yet go to lessen immensely the evils at which it aims.
It appeals to lower motives in those whom it contemplates simply because, in
their present state, no higher motives can be expected to reach them. Might
we not on the same principle say to the slaveholder that although we were con
strained to regard the system as entirely wrong, and that all selling and buying
of human beings is contrary to the fundamental law of Christianity, yet if he
could not be made to feel the force of the obligations requiring the total abandon
ment of the traffic, we would still suggest that he should never sell a slave ex
cept when he had good reason to believe that he would be well treated by his
master ? Could not this be said by a Christian minister without a virtual surren
der of his judgment respecting the moral character of slavery, and without a cri
minal recreancy to the testimony which he was called to bear against it ? This
is doubtless a question involving a grave general principle in casuistry, and this

principle obviously lies at the foundation of all that Swedenborg has said on the
subject of pellicacy. His doctrine is proclaimed in respect to a particular class
of men in a peculiar state of mind. It is easily capable of abuse ; it is capable
also of being acted upon comparatively without abuse in the state of mind supposed.
If now it be replied that such doctrine is false, pernicious, arid destructive to
the interests of religion and virtue, the question, I think, may be proposed, who
will be likely to be injured by being influenced by it when viewed in its alleged
character ? The charge is brought, that Swedenborg, under the claim to a divine
commission, inculcates a most lax morality, that he gives the reins to lust,
that he virtually sanctions unlimited indulgence. How is this teaching to be
practically productive of its legitimate results ? Can it be without some kind of
belief in his authority as an illuminated guide to moral and religious truth ? But
the moment this belief is established in any mind a new and impressive view of
the whole subject of scortatory love is begotten, which completely nullifies the
force of any imaginary license which he may have thought himself to have found
in his writings. With such a presentation of the nature and effects of that love
as Swedenborg sets before him, one cannot avail himself of any immunities which
he may fancy held out to him without at once proving his faith hypocrisy. So
far as he is from this possibility, so far is your statement on this head from the
truth. " These are the directions which his admirers are to feel themselves at
liberty to follow. And if they do not follow them it is for some other reason
than a regard to his principles." Nay, verily, it is for no other reason whatever ;
for they cannot even begin to conceive any stronger dissuasive than they meet
with in these very principles. Thisyou could easily understand if you were once
to put yourself in possession of the evidence which has wrought, in their minds,
so profound a conviction of his truth in what he has delivered on this head.
It is not the New Churchman then whose moral code or whose practical con
duct will be apt to be injured by the exceptionable doctrines of this book. Nor
will injury be likely to accrue to any one who really believes in the tissue of spiritual
developments which are as fully brought out in this as in any other part of Swe-
denborg's writings. Who then is the threatened victim to the disastrous doc
trines of the " Pleasures of Insanity concerning Scortatory Love ?" Is it the man,
however sensual and depraved, who neither believes nor respects Swedenborg
in his assumed character of an illuminated seer ? Will he not share in the general
estimate of the man as a crazed enthusiast ? And are the utterances of such a
man likely to be pleaded by him as a warrant for a carnal career ? Will they be
apt to countervail in any degree the force of those vague and slight, yet scarce
ly effaceable, impressions of sinful wrong, which in a Christian country float,
as it were, about the consciences of the worst of men, and which are to be traced
to the moral sphere emanating from the Bible ? The matter then, as it strikes^ me,
is reduced to a very narrow compass. If a man really believes that Swedenborg
speaks on this subject with authority, he cannot be injured by what he says; if he
does not believe this, he will not ; for what reason can be assigned why any one
should be influenced by a reputed license to do wrong when he sees no cre
dentials of authority in the licenser ?
But if neither the adopters nor the rejectors of Swedenborg's doctrines on this
head are liable to be practically influenced by them, for what purpose were they
given ? Upon what class of men are they designed to bear ? Is not a great amount

of logical and casuistical refinement thrown away ? I am not sure that I shall
answer this question precisely in the manner in which it would be answered by
most of my brethren in the faith, but I can see for myself an important end ac
complished by enabling us to form a proper estimate of the evils in question. His
teachings elevate us to a region whence we can look down upon the field before
us, and intelligently contemplate the workings of the Divine Providence in regard
to men of all classes and characters, and as prompted by all kinds of motives.
In this survey we are enabled to perceive that according to the state of mind and
the force of circumstances in which actions are put forth by merely natural men,
they are marked by various degrees of criminality, and are therefore to have ac
corded to them various degrees of toleration in the legislative and judicial econo
mies which come into the grand system of moral machinery, by which an all-
wise Providence governs the world. There is indeed an interior kingdom, com
posed of spiritual men, and under the direct governance of spiritual laws, which
brook no known infractions by their subjects ; but there is also an external king
dom, composed of worldly men, unsusceptible in their present state of being con
trolled by the highest class of motives, but whose welfare is yet regarded by the
Universal Father, and whose policies are secretly overruled by the Divine Wisdom
in such a manner as to prevent the extinction of all order and of all evil, and
social good. This end is sometimes attained by the permission of a lesser evil
in order to the warding off of a greater, and the present moral state of the agents,
which is evermore exquisitely perceived and regarded by the Lord, being such
as to prevent the peril of profanation, we can see the quality of the permission.
Without the least stain to his own immaculate rectitude, the Most High looks into
without entering into, necessitating, or patronizing the allowed volitions and
actions of his free creatures, and in another life will^'wdge, by active imputation,
and with unerring justice, the moral character of the one and the other. The
spiritual man, who is truely conjoined to the Lord in his affection, is gifted
with some measure of his own divine perception of motives and ends. He
looks forth from his elevated interior sphere into this exterior kingdom of provi
dence, somewhat as the soul contemplates the things of its body, and judges
of whatever is below it, while it remains itself unjudged except by the Omnis
cient. In the more advanced state of things in the present world which Swe-
denborg's system all along interiorly respects, I have little doubt that civil rulers
will see in his developments a measure of judgment by which they shall be
governed in administering the interests of justice among men, and that too with
out compromising the demands of a more spiritual law applicable to spiritual
men. Just in proportion as the conjugial element of our nature shall rise in
general appreciation, will be the estimate formed of the provisions suggested
for its preservation.
The course of discussion brings me to the consideration of another department
of the general subject of Scortatory Love— that of Concubinage, in regard to
which you remark :
" With a most remarkable philanthropy, he extends his care over the conjugal
state, and makes provision, which will be welcome to a certain class of men,
for cases which not unfrequently occur. He objects strongly to a man's cohabit
ing with a wife and a mistress at the same time. But if men have what he calls
'
legitimate, just, and truly conscientious causes to separate themselves and keep
apart from a wife as to actual love,' he allows them '
to have another woman
in keeping.' He specifies a variety of these causes, that is, causes for keeping

apart from a wife and having a mistress ; such as vitiated states of the wife's
body, fevers, leprosies, cancers,—offensive diseases inward or outward, especi
ally those which defile the face, faintness epilepsy, rupture, &c. —also intemper
ance, telling family secrets, disputing, striking, internal dissimilitude, antipathy,
coldness, &c. In these cases, a man may very justly and conscientiously sepa
rate himself from his diseased and suffering, or offending wife, and keep a mis
tress. And our author goes still further, and palliates the crime of adultery in
other circumstances ; namely, ' when a wife by craftiness captivates a man's
mind, enticing him into her bed-chamber, and inflaming his passions,' or when
a man entices another man's wife, and inflames her passions. These and like
circumstances, he says,—operate as reasonable apologies in favor of the party
seduced."— p. 149.
The only reply to this is to be drawn from a full and accurate exhibition of
what Swedenborg has said on the subject of the concubinary relation, especially
as viewed by the light of his general doctrine concerning the conjugial princi
ple, apart from which it cannot be, by any means, properly appreciated. And,
first, let it be observed that he lays it down in several propositions, that "con
cubinage conjointly with a wife is unlawful to Christians, and detestable"—that
" it is polygamy, which is condemned, and to be condemned, by the Chris
tian world"—that it is " unlawful because it is against the conjugial covenant ; and
that it is detestable, because it is against religion, and what is against the latter
and at the same time against the former, is against the Lord" —that " as soon as
any one, without real sufficient cause, adjoins a concubine to a wife, heaven is
closed to him, and by the angels he is no more numbered amongst Christians."
He then proceeds to state, that concubinage apart from the wife, when engaged
in from just, legitimate, and truly sufficient causes is not illicit. In the dis
tinct specification of these causes, he classes them under three heads, the first
of which he terms legitimate, as being identical with the causes that warrant
divorce understood as the abolition of the conjugial covenant, and thence ple
nary separation, leaving the man at entire liberty to marry another wife. The sole
cause of this total separation, or divorce, he says, " is scortation, according to the
precept of the Lord, Matt. xix. 9. That scortation is the sole cause of divorce, is
because it is diametrically opposite to the life of conjugial love, and destroys it even
to extinction." He then goes on to observe that there may be cases where, although
actual ground for plenary divorce exists, yet particular reasons may operate for
" retaining the adulterous wife at home." A number of such reasons he particu
larly recites, which it is not necessary here to mention. The fact however of the
scortation actually dissolves the vinculum matrimonii, and the man is therefore left
in circumstances that release him from any marriage tie which would stand in the
way of such permitted cohabitation as might take place if he had never been
married at all. Concubinage then with him would be but another name for the
pellicacy already treated of, and the requisite conditions of which have been
distinctly stated. But the point especially to be noted in this connection is, that
the legitimate causes of plenary divorce are the legitimate causes of concubinage
or, in other words, of pellicacy, which concubinage in this instance becomes.
These causes however are to be established " by the edicts of judges," that is,
decided and proclaimed by the proper courts of law, and not left to his own
private or personal adjudication. This is the first head of the causes of concu
binage, and no one, I think, can deny that if there are any legitimate causes for
such a relation, the legitimate causes for a full divorce are among them.

But he remarks farther, that in addition to what he terras legitimate there are
also just causes of concubinage, which are to be adjudged by the man alone,
actiny however under the influence of sound and conscientious principles. These
causes are the "just causes of separation from the bed," while at the same time,
the conjugal bond is not dissolved, nor the wife abandoned, nor any of the
domestic duties of a husband relaxed or intermitted, except it be a case, for in
stance, like that of confirmed lunacy or idiocy, where a wife is removed to a
hospital or asylum. In the following paragraphs are enumerated at considera
ble length the causes of thoral separation and consequent concubinage, which he
denominates just, and of which every man is to judge for himself in the fear of
God. I quote from " Conj. Love," 251-254.
" There are given separations from the bed and separations from the house ;
the causes of separation from the bed are numerous, equally so are the separa
tions from the house ; but here it is treated of legitimate ones. (In the subsequent
treatise he terms these causes just.) Since the causes of separation coincide
with the causes of concubinage, concerning which in the following part of this
work, in its own chapter, therefore the reader is referred thither that he may see
the causes in their order. The legitimate causes of separation are those wliich
follow. - .
" That the first cause of legitimate separation is a vitiated state of mind.
The reason of this is, because conjugial love is a conjunction of minds; where
fore if the mind of one of the parties takes a direction different from that of the
other, such conjunction is dissolved, and with the conjunction the love vanishes.
The states of vitiation of the mind, which cause separation, may appear from
enumerating them, and which for the most part are as follow : madness, frenzy,
furious wildness, actual foolishness and idiotcy, loss of memory, violent hyster
ics, extreme silliness so as to admit of no perception of good and truth, a high
degree of stubbornness in refusing to obey what is just and equitable ; a high
degree of pleasure in talkativeness and discoursing only on insignificant and
trifling subjects ; an unbridled desire to publish family secrets, also to quarrel, to
strike, to take revenge, to do evil, to steal, to tell lies, to deceive, to blaspheme ;
carelessness about the children, intemperance, luxury, excessive prodigality,
drunkenness, uncleanness, immodesty, application to magic and witchcraft, im
piety, with several other causes. By legitimate causes are not here meant judi
cial causes, but such as are legitimate in regard to the other married partner.
" That the second cause of legitimate separation is a vitiated state of body.
By vitiated states of body are not meant accidental diseases, which happen to
either of the married partners within the time of their marriage, and pass away;
but by vitiated states of body are meant inherent diseases, which do not pass
away. The science of pathology teaches what these are. They are manifold,
such as diseases whereby the whole body is so far infected, that the contagion
may prove fatal ; of this nature are malignant and pestilential fevers, leprosies,
the venereal disease, gangrenes, cancers, and the like ; also diseases whereby the
whole body is so far weighed down, as to admit of no consociability, and from
which exhale dangerous effluvia and noxious vapors, whether from the surface
of the body, or from its inward parts, in particular from the stomach and lungs :
from the surface of the body proceed malignant pocks, warts, pustules, scorbu
tic phthisic, virulent scab, especially if the face be 'defiled thereby : from the
stomach proceed foul, fetid, rank, and crude eructations : from the lungs, filthy
and putrid exhalations, arising from imposthumes, ulcers, abscesses, or from
vitiated blood or lymph therein. Besides these there are also various other dis
eases, as lipothamia, which is a total faintness of body and defect of strength ;
paralysis, which is a loosing and relaxation of the membranes and ligaments
which serve for motion ; certain chronical diseases, arising from a loss of the
sensibility and elasticity of the nerves, or from too great a thickness, tenacity,
and acrimony of the humors ; epilepsy ; fixed weakness arising from apoplexy ;
certain phthisical complaints, whereby the body is wasted ; the cholic, caeliac
affection, rupture, and other like diseases.

" That the third cause of legitimate separation is impotence before marriage.
The reason why this is a cause of separation is, because the end of marriage is
trie procreation of children, which cannot take place where this cause of separa
tion operates ; and as this is foreknown by the parties, thay are deliberately de
prived of the hope of it, which hope nevertheless nourishes and strengthens
their conjugial love."
The remaining class of causes are what he terms sonticte, or vere sontiaz, which
although rendered in the earlier translation of the " Conjugial Love," conscientious,
and truly conscientious, are undoubtedly more correctly represented by sufficient or
valid, a rendering which has been adopted in the later revised American edition.
These are thus specified, with preliminary remarks.
" That the sufficient causes of this concubinage, are real and not real.
Since besides just causes which are just causes of separation, and thence be
come just causes of concubinage, there are also sufficient causes, which de
pend on judgment and justice with the man ; therefore these also are to be men
tioned : but as the judgments of justice may be perverted and be converted by
confirmations into the appearances of what is just, therefore these causes are
distinguished into.sufficient causes real and not real, and are described sepa
rately
" That the real sufficient causes are such as are grounded in what is just.
To know these causes, it may be sufficient to recount some of them; such as
no natural affection towards children, and a consequent rejection of them, in
temperance, drunkenness, uncleanness, immodesty, a desire of promulgating
family secrets, of disputing, of striking, of taking revenge, of doing evil, of steal
ing, of deceiving; internal dissimilitude, whence jcomes antipathy; froward re
quirement of the conjugial debt, whence the man becomes a cold stone ; appli
cation to magic and witchcraft ; an extreme degree of impiety ; and other simi
lar evils."
Aware, however, of the strength of corrupt nature and the tendency of its
pleadings to falsify and sophisticate sound principles, he proceeds to designate
the not real or fictitious causes which men would be very apt to assign to them
selves byway of justifying a conduct prompted by passion and at war with
morality and religion.
" That causes sufficient not real are such as are not grounded in what is
just, although in the appearance of what is just. These are known from the
sufficient real causes above mentioned, and, if not rightly explored, may ap
pear as just, and yet are unjust; as that times of abstinence are required after
the bringing forth of children, transitory sicknesses of wives, from these and -
other causes a check to prolification, polygamy permitted to the Israelites, and
other like causes of no weight as grounded in justice. These are fabricated by
the men after the contracting of cold, when unchaste lusts have deprived them
of conjugial love, and have infatuated them with an idea of its likeness to scor-
tatory love. Such men, when they engage in concubinage, to prevent defama
tion, make such spurious and fallacious causes real and genuine, and very fre
quently also forge and charge them against the wife, their companions, assent
ing to and re-echoing them according to favor." — C. L. 474.
I have now stated the grounds on which is built the proposition, that concubi
nage apart from a wife, when engaged in from causes legitimate, just, and truly suffi
cient, is not illicit. The bare announcement of this proposition is undoubtedly
calculated to occasion a shock to the prevailing sentiments of the Christian
world, and perhaps to a degree that may close the mind against even any at
tempted explanation of what is really and truly intended by it. The very term con

sible form of toleration allowed to this kind of sexual relation operates with a
species of torpedo touch upon all the virtuous sensibilities of the bosom in
which piety and refined intelligence have found a home. The spontaneous
verdict is prone to be, that nothing —not a syllable— can be uttered in its defence
without meeting an instant repulse and condemnation from the spirit which
has been formed by the pure precepts of Christianity, or without betraying, on
the part of the utterer, an open or latent design to sap the very foundation of
everything lovely and of good report in the sphere of life's tenderest and most
hallowed relations. I should be sorry to think that I failed in any measure to
appreciate the value of such sentiments, or that I had assumed the advocacy of
doctrines which went legitimately to disturb or outrage them. But T have ven
tured to think it possible so to present the views advanced by Swedenborg as to
divest them of that character of extreme repugnancy to preconceived ideas with
which they at first blush array themselves before the mind. And to this end I
observe,
(1.) That it is proper to refer everything said on this head to the general aim
and object of the whole book, which is to elevate and consecrate the conjugial
principle and the conjugial relation above all the ordinary estimates which have
ever been formed on the subject. It is impossible, I think, to doubt that this is
our author's real and supreme intention, and that everything he has said on the
opposite or scortatory principle is designed to act, in a reflex way, in heighten
ing our conceptions of the superlative worth and excellence of that element of
our being to which it stands opposed. In the endeavor to compass this end it
may be said that he has enlisted false principles —that he is inconsistent with
himself —that his reasoning destroys his conclusions —and that consequently the
results are not only fallacious, but pernicious. This remains to be seen ; but
what I at present insist upon is, that the entire drift of his discussion in the body
of the work, as well as innumerable passages in his other writings, cannot in
fairness be otherwise viewed than as aiming at a good end or, in other words,
as evincing a good intention. If notwithstanding he can be shown, on adequate
grounds, to have been mistaken, the mistake, I should suppose, may still be
affirmed in such a manner as to leave unimpaired all the credit due to a worthy
and unexceptionable object.
(2.) It is to be constantly borne in mind that Swedenborg plants himself most
distinctly and emphatically on Scripture ground in maintaining but one sufficient
cause of plenary divorce, viz. that of adultery. It is impossible for language to
be more explicit than that which he employs on this head. He cannot, there
fore, be justly charged with teaching doctrines that go to countenance a light
esteem of the legal bond of matrimony, or to favor a facility in obtaining release
from its obligations. This is still more evident from the following paragraph
from another work which is palpably the language of a very serious mind.
" From what has been said it may without difficulty be concluded and seen,
whether a man be a Christian or not, yea, whether he has any religion or not : for
whosoever does not regard adulteries as sins, in faith and life, is not a Christian,
neither has he any religion. But on the other hand, whosoever shuns adulteries
as sins, especially if he holds them in aversion by reason of their being sins, and
still more, if he abominates them on that account, has religion, and if he be in
the Christian Church, is a Christian." —Doct. of Life, 77.

(3.) It is of the utmost importance that a correct idea should be formed of
what Swedenborg understands by the concubinage of which he speaks, and of its
true relation to the conjugal union. In our common parlance a concubine is little
less than a harlot, but the term has not that opprobrious sense in the sacred writ
ings, where it is used to denote a lawful wife, but of secondary rank, one who
enjoyed no conjugal right but that of cohabitation, and whom the husband could
repudiate and send away with a small present. The concubine of Swedenborg,
however, is net properly a wife, as* this would be polygamy which he pointedly
-condemns as illicit to Christians under any circumstances whatever, as being
directly subversive of the true conjugal relation which can only subsist between
two. The nature of these secondary marriages and the grounds of the permis
sion on which they were founded, are thus unfolded by him in the commentary
on Gen. xxv. 5, 6.
" In order that both the celestial and the spiritual might be represented in
marriages formerly, it was allowed besides a' wife to have also a concubine ;
such concubine was given to the husband by the wife, and was then called his
woman, or was said to be given to him for a woman, as when Hagar the Egyp
tian was given to Abraham by Sarah, when Bilhah the handmaid was given to
Jacob by Rachel, and the handmaid Silpah given to Jacob by Leah, where they
are called women, but in other places concubines, as Hagar the Egyptian in this
verse, and Bilhah, also Keturah herself. That these ancients had concubines be
sides a wife, as not only Abraham and Jacob, but also their posterity, as Gideon,
Saul, David, and Solomon, was of permission, for the sake of representation, viz.,
of the celestial church by a wife, and of the spiritual church by a concubine ;
it was of permission, because they were such that they had no conjugial love,
tjms neither was marriage to them marriage, but only carnal copulation for the
sake of procreating offspring, and to such there might be permissions, without
the injury of conjugial love and the covenant thence derived, but in nowise to
those who are in good and in truth, and who are internal men or can become
so ; for as soon as man is in good and truth, and in things internal, such things
cease ; hence it is not allowable for Christians, as for Jews, to take to themselves
a concubine with a wife, and that this is adultery." —A. C. 3246.
From this it appears very evident that what may be termed the license of con
cubinage is not granted by him to real Christians, or men in a spiritual state of
mind, but permissively to those who have not yet advanced beyond the state of
natural men. I am aware that the propriety of any such species of teaching on
the part of a Christian will be vehemently protested against, but as I have already
dwelt upon this point and may advert to it again in the sequel, I wave all dis
cussion at present, and proceed to remark, that Swedenborg alone has drawn
the true distinction between concubinage and polygamy, the former of which was
permissively granted to the sons of Jacob, and the latter to the sons of Ishmael.
Polygamy ip a kind of diffusion or dissolution of the conjugial love over the sex
in general, whereby it in fact loses its peculiar distinctive character, and is re
solved into a mere prompting of lasciviousness.
" The reason is, because the
love thereof is divided amongst several, and is the love of the sex, and the love
of the external or natural man, and this is not conjugial love, which aionei s
given chaste. That polygamical love is a love divided amongst several, is a
known thing, and divided love is not conjugial love, for this latter love is not to
be divided from one of the sex, hence the former love is lascivious, and poly
gamy is lasciviousness." (C. .L 345). He accordingly affirms that " with poly-
gamists conjugial chastity, purity, and sanctity cannot be given, nor can a poly-
gamist, so long as he remains a polygamist, be made spiritual." Polygamy,

however, is permissively allowed to the Mahometans because love " truly couju-
gial which subsists only between one man and one wife, could not be given, inas
much as they do no not, from a religious principle, acknowledge the Lord
(i.
e.
Christ) as equal to God the Father, and thus as the God of heaven and earth."
He also in the same connection lays down the following principles, which will
be seen to have an important bearing upon the whole subject, particularly so
far as moral conduct
is
related to the prevailing state of mind of the agent.
" That polygamy is not sin with those who live in it from
a
religious prin
ciple. All that which
is
contrary to religion
is
believed to be sin, because
it
is
contrary to God
;
and on the other hand, all that which agrees with religion, is
believed not to be sin, because
it
agrees with God
;
and as polygamy existed
with the sons of Israel from a principle of religion, and in like manner at this
day with the Mahometans,
it
could not, and cannot, be imputed to them as sin.
Moreover, to prevent its being sin to them, they remain natural, and do not be
come spiritual
;
and the natural man cannot see that there
is
anything of sin in
such things as appertain to received religion
;
this
is
seen only by the spiritual
man.
It
is
on this account, that although the Mahometans are taught by the Al
coran to acknowledge our Lord as the son of God, still they do not come to him,
but to Mahomet
;
and so long they remain natural, and consequently do not
know that there
is
in polygamy any evil, nor indeed any lasciviousness. The
Lord also saith,
'
If
ye were blind ye would not have sin
;
but now you say we see,
therefore your sin remaineth' (John ix. 41). Since polygamy cannot convict them
of sin, therefore after death they have their heavens, n. 343
;
and therein have
joys according to their life.
" That polygamy is not sin with those who are in ignorance concerning the
liORD. This is, because love truly coujugial
is
from the Lord only, and cannot
be imparted by the Lord to any others than those who know him, acknowledge
him, believe on him, and live the life which
is
from him; and those to whom
that love cannot be imparted, know no other than that the love of the sex and
conjugial love are the same thing
;
consequently also polygamy. Add to this,
that polygamists, who know nothing of the Lord, remain natural: for a man is
made spiritual only from the Lord
;
and that
is
not imputed to the natural man
as sin, which
is
according to the laws of religion and at the same time of so
ciety
:
he also acts according to his reason
;
and the reason of the natural man
is
in mere darkness respecting love truly conjugial
;
and this love in excellence
is
spiritual. Nevertheless the reason of polygamists
is
taught from experience,
that both public and private peace require, that promiscuous lust in general
should be restrained, and be left to every one within his own house
:
hence
comes polygamy." — C. L. 348, 349.
More will probably be said upon this point hereafter. At present
I
remark
that polygamy, strictly speaking,
is
a divided bestowment of whatever conjugal
love a man has upon several objects instead of one. Concubinage, strictly speak
ing,
is
a separation or segregation of the true conjugial principle, which
is
in
wardly stored up in the mind, and the allotment of the merely external and sen
sual principle, from motives of physical necessity, to the person of a succuba lecti,
or substituted partner
of
lhe bed. The propriety of this relation will of course be
judged of according to the validity of the reasons urging it, and according to the
state of mind of the parties having recourse to it. The positions advanced in the
preceding extracts are certainly entitled to enter into the estimate formed of the
morale of such connections, while the very fact that
a
man
is
able lo appreciate
,
them, renders any practical decision in regard to his own case extremely peril
ous
;
for
it
supposes his understanding to be elevated out of its native darkness
into a degree of rational and moral light which confers a higher responsibility
on all his acts.

REPLY TO DR. WOODS. 227
Still it must be said that your representations on the subject give a very dis
torted view of the teachings of Swedenborg. The concubinage of which he
speaks, and which, under the specified conditions, he declares not to be il
licit, is the farthest possible remove from an authorized sundering of the rela
tion between husband and wife, or an exemption from the discharge of its du
ties. The impression which would be naturally conveyed of his teaching by the
following extract from your work is exceedingly wide of the truth.
" And shall I advert again to the other case ? A man has a wife, whom he
has solemnly promised and vowed to love and cherish and comfort while life
lasts. She is the wife of his youth, his faithful, affectionate partner, and the
loving mother of his children. But she is visited with painful and exhausting
sickness, it may be with fever, or cancer, or epilepsy, or paralysis, or consump
tion. Her low and suffering state calls for the kindest attentions and the tender-
est sympathy of her husband. But instead of these kind and solicitous attentions
and this tender sympathy towards his innocent and faithful, but suffering wife, he
is to turn away from her to enjoy the society of a kept mistress ! What shall we
say to these things ? Why, if a book containing these principles should be pub
lished in Massachusetts, the author would be liable to punishment for violating
the wholesome laws of the Commonwealth." —p. 152.
If such an indictment were drawn up against the real purport of Swedenborg's
doctrine on this subject, it would be simply upon this ground —that in crises
where the physical br mental condition of a wife was such as to preclude entirely
the possibility of that connubial commerce which enters so deeply into the de
sign and the delights of marriage, an emergency arises for which, as some provi
sion is naturally felt to be desirable, so it is suggested in the temporary expe
dient, which, for want of a better term, is here denominated concubinage. It is an
expedient suggested by the fact, that the causes which incapacitate a wife from
rendering that " due benevolence " to a partner which he may properly seek, still
leave the husband under the full promptings of a constitutional appetite which
craves the indulgence that was among the lawful motives to marriage. These
promptings, however strong, he had no thought of gratifying in any other than
the appointed way so long as the opportunity remained to him. He cherishes
the most unfeigned and devoted affection for his suffering companion. He re
laxes in no duty of the most tender friend. With a sedulous sympathy he waits
upon her wants, and with yearning anxiety hails every symptom of returning
health or sanity. But his temperament allows him not to forget, meantime,
that he is a man, or, to suppress the query, whether any other course remains
than a calm submission to a privation which unforeseen circumstances have
brought upon him. This query is undoubtedly proposed in a thousand instances
in the depths of the soul, and no answer is returned that fully satisfies the interro
gating spirit. The action will usually be according to the dominant character of
the individual concerned. With a religious man, governed by a tender con
science, the conclusion will scarcely fail to be, that he is to recognize in such an
extremity, a special ordainment of the Divine providence, intended as a trial of
his faith and patience, and that the only alternative is a meek acquiescence in the
wise will of his Heavenly Father, and when the affection for his wife is deep and
mtense, he will find, I presume, comparatively little inconvenience in submitting
to his lot. It is at any rate, on all accounts the soundest and safest course, and
he that adopts it will be acting on the true principles of Swedenborg's conjugial
do ctrines.

But suppose the case of one of a different character, a man whose breast is not
profoundly penetrated by religious principles, but who is yet of kindly affections,
of fair external deportment, and unexceptionable in his civil and domestic rela
tions —one who, in ordinary parlance, would be termed a good citizen, a good
neighbor, a good husband, but who at the same time has not come under that
peculiar experimental influence of religious truth which we usually associate with
the highest type of moral character. He is not devoid of conscience ; he feels
and acknowledges the obligation of the marriage tie ; he has no disposition to
slight the claims of an affectionate wife ; but he is still conscious of the pressure
of natural promptings, and he is inwardly sensible to what he deems an urgent
"necessity" on this score, to the demands of which he feels that he might yield
without detriment to his conjugial love, provided it could be done, without at the
same time, doing violence to his conscience. It is doubtless such a case that
Swedenborg's suggestions more particularly contemplate, and the question is how
far he is warranted in even hinting at a course made permissible only in very pe
culiar circumstances, and in a state of mind that comes short of the full require
ments of a spiritual law. I am well aware of the delicacy and the difficulty of
the subject, and my grand reliance, in attempting to rebut the force of your ob
jections, is in presenting distinctly the views of Swedenbqrg, and the reasons
which he urges in their support. Judgment will then be pronounced upon their
intrinsic merits.
That there is at least something hard in the compulsory seclusion supposed,
especially with men of ardent temperament, will doubtless be generally admitted,
even when it is still looked upon as an allotment that admits of no remedy, as,
for instance, in the case of one whose wife has become the hopeless inmate of
a lunatic asylum. That it is moreover, a case in which inquiry often arises as
to the possibility of a dispensation consistent with human and divine laws, is
beyond doubt. Equally indubitable is the fact, that both civil and ecclesiastical
tribunals have, in many instances, been prone to lean to the side of lenity in de
ciding upon extreme cases of this kind.* It has indeed for the most part assumed
the form of a question respecting the right of polygamy where the ends of a prior
marriage were frustrated, and in this form it came prominently before the
Reformers, who were evidently greatly perplexed by it. The following ex
tract from Michelet's Life of Luther, will serve as a specimen of the cases of con-
* The subjoined extract does not present a ease entirely parallel to that we are now
considering, but it shows that concubinage has not been altogether unknown in the Chris
tian church.
"The first council of Toledo (A. D. 400) has this canon: —' He who with a believ
ing wife, hath a concubine is excommunicated ; but if his concubine is instead of a wife,
and he adheres to her alone, whether she be called a wife or a concubine, he is not to
be rejected from communion.' '
This Canon,' says Fleury, ' shows that there were
concubines approved by the Church. According to the Roman laws, every woman
could not be the legitimate wife of every man. Both were to be Roman citizens and
of a suitable condition. A senator could not marry a freed woman: a free man could
not marry a slave; and the cohabitation of slaves was not called by the name of mar
riage. But a woman who could not be taken as a wife, might be taken as a concu
bine ; and the laws allowed it, provided the man had only one concubine, and was not
a married man. The children of such marriages were neither legitimate nor bastards,
but natural children acknowledged by the father, and capable of receiving legacies.
The Church meddled not with these distinctions of the civil laws ; but regarding only
the law of nature, approved of every conjunction of one woman, if it was one woman
only, and perpetual ; and the more so, because the Holy Scriptures employ the name of
-wife or of concubine indifferently.'" —(Jortin's Rem. on Eccles. Hist. Vol. 1. p. 422.)

science that were sometimes brought before them. The letter of the Landgrave of
Hesse shows a curious and even amusing conflict between the promptings of
the lower and the dictates of the higher nature.
" We noticed at an early period of this narrative, the melancholy state of de
pendence in which the Reformation was placed on the princes that espoused the
cause. Luther had time to foresee the results. These princes were men, with
men's caprices and passions. And hence concessions, which, without being
contrary to the principles of the reformation, seemed to redound little to the
honor of the reformers. The most warlike of these princes, the hotheaded
landgrave of Hesse, submitted to Luther and the Protestant ministers, that
his health would not all«w of his confining himself to one wife. His in
structions to Bucer for the negotiation of this matter with the theologians of
Wittemberg, are a curious mixture of sensuality, of religious fears, and of
daring simplicity. '
Ever since I have been married,' he writes, '
I have lived
in adultery and fornication ; and as I won't give up this way of living, I cannot
present myself at the holy table ; for St. Paul has said, that the adulterer shall
not enter the kingdom of heaven.' He proceeds to state the reasons which
drive him into this course :
'
My wife is neither good looking nor good-tem
pered ; she is not sweet ; she drinks, and my chamberlains can tell what she
then does, &c. I am of a warm complexion, as the physicians can prove ;
and as I often attend the imperial diets, where the body is pampered with high
living, how am I to manage there without a wife, especially as I can't be always
taking a seraglio about with me ? . . . How can I punish fornication and other
crimes, when all may turn round and say, " Master, begin with yourself?" . . .
Were I to take up arms for the Gospel's sake, I could only do so with a troubled
conscience, for I should say to myself, " If you die in this war, you go to the
devil." ... I have read both the Old and New Testament carefully, and find
no other help indicated than to take a second wife ; and I ask before God
why cannot I do what Abraham, Jacob, David, Lamech, and Solomon have
done ?' The question of polygamy had been agitated from the very beginning
of Protestantism, which professed to restore the world to scriptural life ; and,
whatever his repugnance, Luther durst not condemn the Old Testament.
Besides, the Protestants held marriage to be res politico., and subject to the reg
ulations of the civil power. Luther, too, had already held, theoretically, and
without advising it to be put in practice, the very doctrine advanced by the land
grave. He had written years before : . . .
'
I confess, I cannot say that polygamy
is repugnant to Holy Scripture, yet would not have the practice introduced
amongst Christians, who ought to abstain even from what is lawful, in order to
avoid scandal, and in order to maintain that honestas (decorum) which. St. Paul
requireth under all circumstances.'— (Jan. 13th, 1524.)
'
Polygamy is not allowa
ble amongst Christians, except in cases of absolute necessity, as when a man is forced to'
separate from a leprous wife,' &c.
" Luther was greatly embarrassed by the landgrave's message. All the theo
logians of Wittemberg assembled to draw up an answer, and the result was a
compromise. He was allowed a double marriage, on condition that his second
wife should not be publicly recognized. '

Here is certainly a «oncession made to virtual concubinage by these grave and
reverend men, and that too on the ground of the urgent solicitations of the flesh
to which, in natural men, Swedenborg intimates that some clemency may be
shown. And that Luther himself had a tolerably high idea of the strength of
these propensities is very clear from the extracts which follow. ." Luther being
asked whether a Christian preacher, who is bound to suffer imprisonment and
persecution for the word's sake, ought not much more to do without marriage ?
replied ;
' It is easier to endure imprisonment than desire, as I know in my own
person. The more I strove to macerate and subdue the flesh, the more I lusted.' "
To a friend he writes ;
" If you lust, marry . . . No one will ever have to repent
rising early and marrying young .... It is no more possible to do without a
wife than without eating and drinking. Conceived, nourished, and born within
the body of woman, our flesh is mainly hers, and it is impossible for us ever to
separate wholly from her." — {Mitchelet, p. 175, 176).
It will be observed that in the sentence of the venerable conclave at Wittem
berg the mattter is put very much upon the basis mentioned by Swedenborg.
He says it is better that one should be wholly continent, but
if,
from the ardor of
his temperament, he cannot contain, then let the intercourse be restricted to oue
woman rather than let passion run riot with many. So in the Wittemberg decree
;
although a rigid self denial would be vastly preferable, yet " nevertheless
if
your
highness
is
fully resolved to take a second wife, we are of the opinion that the
marriage should be secret." The " Antichristicide" and his associates herein
display a complaisance to the prince and an estimate of the pressure- of " the
present necessity" which,
I
doubt, would hardly meet a favoring response from
their most fervent admirers of later times.
The dubious Landgrave was at a loss,
it
seems, to know why the license ac
corded to Abraham, Jacob, David, Lamech, and Solomon, could not be granted
to him also. Had the " Conjugial Love" then been written, and had Luther been
somewhat more of a Swedenborgian than Swedenborg was a Lutheran, he
would have been very apt to quote for the querists' edification the ensuing para

church, nor concerning the change of the church from external to internal by
the Lord ; consequently they know nothing from interior judgment concerning
marriages. In general it is to be observed, that a man is born natural in order
that he may be made spiritual ; and that so long as he remains natural, he is in
the night, and as it were in sleep concerning things spiritual ; and that in this
ca3e he does not even know the difference between the external natural man
and the internal spiritual. That the Christian church was not with the Israel-
itish nation, is known from the Word ; for they expected the Messiah, as they
still expect him, who was to exalt them above all nations and people in the
world ; wherefore if they had been told, and were still to be told, that the Mes
siah's kingdom is over the heavens, and thence over all nations, they would have
accounted it an idle tale ; hence it was, that they not only did not acknowledge
Christ or the Messiah, our Lord, when he came into the world, but also barbar
ously took him away out of the world. From these considerations it is evident,
that the Christian church was not with that nation, as neither is it at this day ;
and those with whom the Christian church is not, are natural men both exter
nally and internally ; and to such polygamy is not hurtful, since it is inscribed on
the natural man ; for, in regard to love in marriages, the natural man perceives,
aothing but what appertains to lust. This is meant by these words of the Lord
' That Moses because of the hardness or their heart suffered them to put away their
wives; but thatfrom the beginning it was not so' (Matt. xix. 8)."— C. L. 340.
If this be sound reasoning, there was an actual concession made, under the
ancient economy, to the infirmities of human nature, and yet it was one which
had special relation to the state of mind of the parties concerned, and one which
could' only receive toleration on the ground of that state. It would seem that
Luther was at a loss to perceive why the principle thus recognized under the
divine administration should not operate where the original grounds and reasons
for it were equally cogent. He would probably have been strongly predisposed
to side with the reasoning of Milton ;
" If the law will afford no reason why the
Jew should be more gently dealt with than the Christian, then surely the gospel
can afford as little why the Christian should be less gently dealt with than the
Jew. The gospel indeed exhorts to highest perfection, but bears with weakest
infirmity more than the law. Hence those indulgences, '
all cannot receive this
saying ; every man hath his proper gift,' with express charges not to '
lay on
yokes which our fathers could not bear.' " " The nature of man still is as weak,
and yet as hard ; and that weakness and hardness as unfit and as unteachable
to be hardly used as ever." ..." If those indulgences were safe and sinless, out
of tenderness and compassion, as indeed they were, and yet shall be abrogated
by the gospel; then the law, whose end is by rigor to magnify grace, shall itself
give graee, and pluck a fair plume from the gospel." ..." If the gospel require
perfecter obedience than the law as a duty, it exalts the law and abases itself,
which is dishonorable to the work of our redemption. Seeing therefore that all
the causes of any allowance that the Jews might have, remain as well to the
Christians ; this is a certain rule, that so long as the causes remain, the allow
ance ought."
That there actually was something in the Jewish code analogous to the ex
pedients pointed out by S wedenborg, is bayond all question. Thujs from Ex. xxi.
9, it appears that parents, in order to guard their adult male offspring from
debauehery before marriage, used to give them one of their female slaves as a
concubine. This was undoubtedly on the principle of consulting just such an
apprehended necessity as Swedenborg speaks of in what he says of pellicacy, and
this provision stands indelible in the book of God, and as an integral part of
that system of enactments which he gave to the chosen people. I do not refer

to it With the design to imply that Christian men are now at liberty to avail them
selves of such a provision, but simply to show that the grand principle which
lies at the foundation of these scortatory doctrines has been distinctly recognized
in the Divine economy as set forth in the inspired writings, and consequently
that there is some sense in which such permissions are not irreconcilably at war
with the will of Jehovah. Tf they were intrinsically in absolute antagonism
with the moral precepts of the Decalogue they could no more have been allow
ed under the law than under the gospel, nor will it be easy to- say why they
should be any less allowed under the gospel than under the law. The matter
then resolves itself into the question, whether the strength of the rational con
viction on this head may not be such as to make it at least very difficult to con
ceive that our Lord, who himself gave the Jews their laws, really intended to do
away all such permissions, not in regard to his own true disciples, but in re
gard to those who were not at present sufficiently in the light of truth or the
love of good to heed the demands of a higher precept. If, notwithstanding, it be-
maintained that the strictness of the letter on this point is to be unabatingly ad
hered to, how shall we suffer ourselves to relax the rigor of the requisitions
which occur in the same connection, in the Sermon on the Mount ?
" If thy
right eye offend thee, pluck it out. If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off."
Who understands this literally ? " I say unto you, swear not at all. Let your
communication be yea, yea ; nay, nay." Is this literally acted upon by the mass
of Christians ? Are not oaths every where in use ? " Whosoever shall smite thee
upon thy right cheek turn to him the other also. And if any man will sue thee
at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also." Is this precept
ever looked upon as literally binding ?
" Lay not up for yourselves treasures-
upon earth." What kind of commentary do we read upon this text in the daily
lives of professed Christians ? It will doubtless be said that in all these cases the
mind readily perceives the general spirit of the lesson taught, and acknowledges no
violence done to the Saviour's scope, though the express terms of the letter are not
punctiliously adhered to. A principle is elicited, and even the very principle
which was virtually inculcated in the Mosaic law, but which had been per
verted and abused by the national usage. Why then shall we any more in
sist that the principle which dictated certain permissions in certain circumstan
ces under the former economy shall not be allowed to operate, in the same cir
cumstances, under the gospel dispensation ? Are " the letters to be turned into
palisadoes to stake out all requisite sense from entering into their due enlarge
ment ?"
As I have quoted Martin Luther, I will here adduce the words of Martin
Bucer, one of his illustrious compeers in the work of the Reformation. Ke is-
indeed urging a plea for divorce, which I do not endorse, but the grounds of his
plea are equally applicable to the separation of whieh I am treating ; and the
same remark I would make in reference to all my citations from Milton. His-
reasonings I consider valid, but I do not agree with his conclusions respecting the
proper remedy.
" It cannot be doubted by them to whom it is given to know
God and his judgments out of his own words, but that, what means of peace
and safety God ever granted and ordained to his elected people, the same he
grants and ordains to men of all ages, who have equally need of the same reme

form either conjugal affection, or any requisite duty thereof, though it be most
deserved at their hands ? Neither can any one defer to confess, but that God,
whose property it is to judge the causes of them that s-uffer injury, has provided
for innocent and honest persons wedded, how they might free themselves by
lawful means of divorce, from the bondage and iniquity of those who are
falsely termed their husbands or their wives. This is clear out of Deut. xxiv. 1 ;
Mai. ii; Mat. xix. 1 ; 1 Cor. vii;' and out of those principles which the Scripture
every where teaches, that God changes not his mind, dissents not from himself,
is no accepter of persons; but allows the same remedies to all men oppressed
with the same necessities and infirmities ; yea, requires that we should use
them. This he will easily perceive, who considers these things in the spirit of
the Lord." —Judg. of Divorce, ch. xxxvi. The sentiment here advanced may not
perhaps find general assent in the present state of religious opinion, but it is
worth inquiry whether those who reject it may not mistake a " letter-bound ser
vility to canon doctors," for the voice of God speaking through the living
oracles of the word-enlightened spirit. The permissions conceded in the Mosaic
law, or rather the causes on which they are founded, appear to be occasionally
recognized in the subsequent Scriptures, as where Solomon says, for instance,
" It is better to dwell in a corner of the house-top than with a brawling woman
in a wide house." And again, " It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with
a contentious and angry woman." This surely means something, and I see not
how it can amount to anything less than a warrant for domiciliary separation,
which goes at least so far towards sustaining what Swedenborg has said on that
subject. As to auy ulterior resort in such a case, this must be judged of by the
sufficiency of the grounds alleged for it. By a Jew it would doubtless be under
stood as authorizing recourse to divorce on the basis of Deut. xxiv. 1. It is cited
here simply as an illustration of the principle of concession, of which it is diffi
cult to see why it should not always operate where the original causes operate.
So also, Mai. 2. 16, " For the Lord, tjie God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting
away." This is undoubtedly an erroneous rendering instead of the genuine,
" He that hateth, let him put away," as the great current of versions and com
mentators have it. Venema has elaborately shown that the words come in as a
counterplea of the Jews, to whom it is said in the preceding verse, " Take heed
to your spirit, and let none of yon deal treacherously against the wife of his
youth." "But," reply the reprimanded people, "the Lord, the God of Israel,
saith, He that hateth his wife let him put her away." " Nay," rejoins the Prophet,
" although that is true, yet this is an abuse of the divine clemency ; ye have made
it a plea for the grossest wrong which ye would fain cloak under the alleged
license ; but such a plea will no more conceal it than will a garment an act of
violence- Therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously."
The principle is allowed, but its perversion condemned. Again, we find some
thing analogous in the words of Paul, 1 Cor. vii. 15, " But if the unbelieving de
part, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases."
The supposed cause of separation here is a difference of religion, but the prin
ciple involved is substantially the same. It is a relaxation of the iron rigor of
the law of marriage in accommodation to the force of circumstances.

cates a species of connection which has not, in Scripture, the opprobrious char
acter that in our ordinary parlance attaches to it —and having learnt that it does
not imply that heartless abandonment which you have ascribed to it—it remains
to advert to the causes which he, with so much caution and discrimination, pro
nounces "legitimate, just, and really sufficient." These he says are various
" vitiated states of mind and body," which he enumerates, and of which a man
is constituted himself the sole judge. I have little to say in regard to these
causes in addition to what I find said by the author himself. In regarcLto most
of them they do, I confess, strike me as answering to the character described ;
as going to frustrate some of the important ends of marriage ; and therefore as
entitled to weigh in the case of a resort to the alternative suggested. In respect
to some others, such as " loss of memory," —" extreme simplicity," —" unbridled
eagerness to talk upon insignificant and trifling things, and to publish the secrets
of the house" —" detrimental effluvia exhaled from the body or the lungs," &c., I
am somewhat less clear in my mind from not knowing precisely the extent of
the author's meaning, or the degree in which he supposes the different ailments
should exist in order to legitimate them as grounds of separation from the bed,
which, by the way, is all that he speaks of in the former part of the work where
he first enumerates them. Still, if I were better instructed as to the real meaning
of Swedenborg, I presume I should have little difficulty in conceding the valid
ity of all the causes cited ; but as it is, I have no difficulty in assenting to the
position, that the man himself, or, on the other hand, the woman, is to be the
exclusive judge of the supposed necessity of the case. A married partner may
sometimes be reduced to a state of living martyrdom by a complication of griev
ances and vexations which he could never think of divulging to the world, or it
may be to the most intimate friend. He can only say with the old Roman,
Paulus Emilius, when asked why he would put away his wife for no visible
reason ;
" This shoe," said he, holding it out on his foot, " is a neat shoe, a new
shoe, and yet none of you can tell where it pinches me." The secrets of the
parlor or the bed-chamber are not to be proclaimed upon the house-tops. The
design of marriage is to promote the mental and corporeal happiness of the
wedded pair. If this end is. in either department, defeated by the hopeless in
firmities or the ingrained and incurable perversities of a partner, and the reli
gious principle is not sufficiently strong to dictate an uncomplaining submission
to the cross, Swedenborg says of such an one —not to him —that recourse ad exi-
gentiam to concubinage is not illicit. It is made licit by his present state of mind,
on the same principle on which he says that polygamy is not a sin, to those who
practise it under the sanction of the religion in which they have been reared, for
" to him that thinketh anything to be sin, to him it is sin." The permission is
clearly liable to abuse, and a man may capriciously endow himself with a license
at which strict justice would revolt. On this head he is to be studiously on his
guard. Thus as to bodily diseases, he may take undue advantage of a mere
transient indisposition, whereas Swedenborg is very express in saying, that " by
vitiated states of body are not meant accidental diseases which befal one or other
conjugial partner within the time of their marriage, and pass away ; but by viti
ated states of body, are meant inherent diseases, which do not pass away."
And so, by parity of reasoning, of all other causes assigned, a man is to " judge
righteous judgment," and the more so, if possible, inasmuch as he acknow

ledges no other tribunal than that of his own conscience before God. With a
man of honorable and generous sentiments it may be presumed that he will
shrink from anything really injurious to the feelings of a wife whom he tenderly
esteems, and it is very conceivable that on her part she may, in peculiar circum
stances, so far appreciate the force of a partner's plea, as voluntarily to accord
to the promptings of the man a privilege which she deems would not necessa
rily withdraw from her the affections of a husband. We can scarcely suppose
that Sarah in giving her maid Hagar to Abraham, or Rachel in giving Bilhah to
Jacob, or Leah in giving him Zilpah, regarded themselves as signing away their
title to their husband's love.
If it be said that this is a vein of remark utterly inapropos to anything
that can be conceived of the workings of a Christian mind, I have only to
say in reply, that this entire discussion has reference to the opposite of true con-
jugial love, and of course to the exercises and judgments of truly regenerate
men. It is not supposed that they apply to Christians acting as Christians.
All scortatory demonstrations are a form of evil, and falling without the sphere
of genuine good, and are viewed by Swedenborg in this light throughout
every page of his treatise. Still he does not consider himself precluded from
speaking of them, from characterizing them, or drawing important distinc
tions concerning them. If a missionary of the New Church were to go to the
Mahometans to preach to them its doctrines, he would undoubtedly assure them
that their polygamy was directly at war with the essential genius of the conju
gal relation, and consequently with the laws of their spiritual being, and that
without renouncing it they could never enter the Christian's heaven ; and yet he
would not feel disposed to cancel a page of the work on '' Conjngial Love," nor
to conceal from any one who could intelligently receive them the principles it
contains respecting the bearing which the dominant mental and moral state of
every individual has upon the character of his actions and the determination of
his destiny. He would doubtless feel bound to exercise a wise discretion, but if
duly called upon, and especially if unjustly accused in regard to the scope of
his teachings, why should he shrink from the enunciation of positive truth ? And
under parallel circumstances why should not the course which would be proper
at Constantinople, be proper also at London or New York ? Let it be clearly
shown that a Christian moralist has in no case a right to discriminate between
the different degrees of evil —to treat of the laws of permission as well as
the laws of command —to point out, in reference to a certain class of men,
the mode by which a great evil may be coerced, limited, and reduced to a
less, while there is no rational prospect of its being at present extirpated —
and we shall then begin to question in earnest the propriety of upholding Swe-
denborg's doctrine respecting the intercourse of the sexes. But till this is done,
we see not why his leading positions, which are in full accord with the
fundamental doctrines he has taught, should not be regarded as sound. They
can only, however, be justly appreciated by being viewed in connection with
what he has said of the grounds on which judgment on human actions is pro
nounced in the other life. To this point I shall soon advert.

being, receiving its character from its origin in the union of love and wisdom,
or truth and good, by which alone the soul is conjoined or married to the Lord,
on the ground of which He is pleased to style himself the Husband and the
Church his Bride or Wife, and to which Paul evidently alludes as a" great mys
tery" shadowed forth in the marriage relation.* I am well aware that such lan
guage as Swedenborg employs in the following paragraphs will be deemed
extravagant by those who have never been in the habit of referring natural loves
to spiritual principles, but let the assertions be tried by the reasons adduced in
their support, and then see if their truth can be gainsayed.
"Inasmuch as the conjugial principle of one man with one wife is the
store-house of human life, and the reservoir of the christian religion.
These two things are what have been demonstrated universally and singularly
in the whole preceding part concerning conjugial love and the delights of its
wisdom. The reason why it is the storehouse of human life is, because a man's
life is of a quality according to the quality of that love with him; since that love
constitutes the inmost principle of his life : for it is the life of wisdom cohabiting
with its love, and of love cohabiting with its wisdom, and hence it is the life of
the delights of each; in a word, a man is a soul living by means of that love :
hence it is, that the conjugial tie of one man with one wife is called the store
house of human life. This is confirmed from the following articles above ad
duced, That with one wife there exist truly conjugial friendship, confidence and
potency, because a union of minds, n. 333, 334. That in a union with one wife,
and from
it,
exist celestial blessednesses, spiritual satisfactions, and thence nat
ural delights, which from the beginning have been provided for those who are in

it
is
the foundation love of all celestial, spirit
ual, and derivative natural loves, and that into that love are collated all joys and
delights from first to last, n. 65 to 69
;
and that viewed in its origin,it
is
the sport
of wisdom and love, has been fully demonstrated in the Delights of Wisdom con
cerning Conjugial Love, which constitute the first part of this work.
" The reason why that love
is
the reservoir of the Christian religion is, because
this religion makes one with that love, and cohabits with it; for
it was shown,
* "I spake with them concerning marriages —that marriages or conjugial love was
the foundation of all loves, which is confirmed from the consideration, that thence
is
the propagation of human society, and consequently of celestial societies, wherefore
it
has imparted to
it
a corporeal pleasure surpassing all others, for delights are adjoined
according to the necessities of ends, and conjugial love
is
pleasanter and happier than
any other love, so that a right conjugial union
is
heaven upon earth, thus
is
celestial
love, from which flow all other loves, being originally derived from the love or merely of
the Lord towards heaven, the church, and the universal human race, and descending from
Him alone
;
from which
it
appears how sacred marriages ought to be held." —S.-V. 3778.

I

live according to his precepts
;
thus
it

I
added,
'
I
am in doubt whether in the world at this day they are willing to believe, that
this love in itself
is
a spiritual love, and hence grounded in religion, because they en

is according to religion with man, spiritual with the spiritual, natural with the natural,
and merely carnal with adulterers." — C. L. 534.

No slight confirmation
is
afforded to this by what Paley says of the natural
effect of licentiousness. " However
it

of the sexes corrupts and depraves the mind and moral character more than any
single species of vice whatsoever. That ready perception of guilt, that prompt
and decisive resolution against it, which constitute a virtuous character,

mission for every sin that seeks it, and are, in low life, usually the first stage in
men's progress to the most desperate villanies
;
and in high life, to that lament
ed dissoluteness of principle which manifests itself in a profligacy of public
conduct, and a contempt of the obligations of religion and of moral probity.
Add to this, that habits of libertinism incapacitate and indispose the mind for
all intellectual, and moral, and religious pleasures." —(Mor. Philos. B. in., P. in.,
Ch. II.)
Who but will subscribe to the truth of this, though Swedenborg alone has
solved the problem of its rationale
?
Who can be insensible to the immense
difficulty of obtaining
a
lodgment for the claims of the gospel in a mind thus de
praved and abandoned to the dominance of sensual appetites
?
The moral sense,
which in other cases we may hope to reach and awaken,
is
in such persons
well nigh annihilated. The plane into which the Divine good and truth may
flow as the ground of regeneration has with men of this stamp all but perished,
and
it
is
a forlorn hope indeed which encourages any appeal to their inner man.
And
if
this be so,
is
it
not a great object to preserve,
if
possible, the life of the con
jugial love
?
And where there
is
danger of its being lost, does
it
not warrant the
striking
a
balance between the evil of the extinction of such a principle, and the
evil of the permitted yielding, by natural men, to the promptings of the mere
animal or corporeal instinct in which the spiritual principle
is
enwrapped
?
In
other words,
is
there not an intrinsic weight in what
is
said in the ensuing ex

ed ; that it is so, the lover does not know, because spiritual love is no sensibly
perceived of itself, but by means of natural ; and it is felt as delight in which is
blessedness from heaven ; but natural love, by itself, is felt only as delight."
Intimations like these could never have proceeded from the pure pen of the
apostle of the New Church, were they not founded upon a fundamental doctrine
of conjugial love drawn from the very depths of celestial wisdom —a doctrine
which makes that love the gem of the soul and the " reconditory" of the Chris
tian religion. The doctrine may be taxed as the wildest of the reveries incorpo
rated into a strange fabric of spiritual mysticisms, but the system knows well
how to account for such an imputation. " With those who reject the holy things
of the church, there is not any good love ; . . . for all things of the church which
they reject are spiritual ; and because love truly conjugial is the fundamental of
all spiritual loves, it is manifest that there is an intrinsecal hatred against
that, and that the intrinsecal or proper love with them is in favor of the op
posite, and is the love of adultery ; wherefore those more than others will laugh
to scorn this truth, that conjugial love with every one is according to the state
of the church (with him) ; yea, at the naming of love truly conjugial they will
perhaps laugh outright ; but be it so : nevertheless they are to be forgiven, for it is
as impossible for them to distinguish in thought between the marriage embrace
and the scortatory embrace, as it is for a camel to go through the eye of a
needle."
We have here the true point against which all severity of censure, all fierce
ness of condemnation, on the score of Swedenborg's scortatory teaching must
spend itself. The intensest power of the virus of his doctrines concentrates itself
in the assertion of the religious nature and the transcendant purity and sanctity
of the conjugial principle. This is the central and vital position of the whole
doctrine, and if it be said of the system that thus viewed " the whole head
is sick and whole heart faint ; that from the sole of the foot even unto the head,
there is no soundness in it, but wounds and bruises and putrifying sores," here
is the real seat of the deadly gangrene, in the distinct declaration of the heavenly
origin, the spiritual character, the angelic affinities, of the love of marriage. Let
this position be overthrown, and we may well waver in our defence. But our
feet know no titubation so long as they stand upon the immovable rock on
which we feel that they are planted. Meantime we have the satisfaction of the
assurance, that we are not called to the vindication of a scheme of ethics which
transforms the evils of pellicacy, adultery, and concubinage into the goods of
Christian or civil life. They are all the evils of " scortation" in some of its
forms ; they all pertain to the natural and not to the spiritual man. The man
who is formed by the genuine doctrines of Swedenborg has nothing to do with
them. He is a spiritttal man. " He does not," says Mr. Bailey, " indulge his flesh ;
he subdues
it.

concubinage to be less interiorly base than incest, without being attracted by

abyss of impiety so abominable as many other evils, yet it is of the earth, earthy.
It would retard him in his upward career. It would make him the creature of
his natural propensities ; not their lord. It may 'be an evil less heinous than
some others, but he is to love no evil. He is daily to increase in the possession
of goodness. It is an insanity of a lighter kind, but he is the follower of wisdom.
The world has doubtless its various degrees of vice, but his aim is to higher
states of purity, more full communion with God, a more glorious impress of
heaven. He soars, therefore, above all the walks of vice, and daily makes it his
study to acquire more fully the image, likeness, and spirit of his Master. . . Does
any one ask whether we can judge of the degrees of evils, and assign the rela
tive iniquity to each, without being allured by the love of any ? We reply, look
at our lives. Where is there a real New Churchman who lives in concubinage ?
Had Swedenborg really recommended concubinage, is it conceivable that out of
so many who have embraced his views, not one should practise it? When John
said, '
All unrighteousness is sin ; and there is a sin not unto death f was he
preaching up these sins ? He was but discriminating truly. And when Swe
denborg distinguishes one crime from another, he does not sanction the commis
sion of any, but accords to each its proper condemnation." — {Bailey's Reply to
Roebuck, p. 34.)
(6.) Another consideration of the utmost moment to a fair estimate of Sweden-
borg's averments on this subject, is the doctrine of imputation, or the ground of
judgment, by which the whole matter is wound up, eclaircised, and guarded, and
which yet is next to never adverted to by his opponents. There is obviously no
question of more importance to a candidate for eternity than that which con
cerns the grounds and reasons of the judgment that fixes unalterably his state in
the other world. That these have relation to his character as good or evil, can
admit of no doubt ; his works and deeds enter into the account no farther than
as they are a true index to the internal man, or, in one word, to the heart.
" It is well known, that there are two principles which make a man's life, the
will and the understanding; and that all things which are done by a man, are
done from his will and his understanding ; and that without these acting prin
ciples a man would not have either action or speech, otherwise than as a ma
chine : hence it is evident, that such as a man's will and understanding are, such
is the man ; and further, that a man's action in itself is such, as is the affection
of his will which produces it, and that a man's discourse in itself is such, as is
the thought of his understanding which produces it : wherefore several men
may act and speak alike, and yet they act and speak unlike ; one from a de
praved will and thought, the other from an upright will and thought. From these
considerations it is manifest, what is meant by the deeds or works, according
to which every one will be judged ; that will and understanding are meant, con
sequently that by evil works are meant the works of an evil will, whatever has
been their appearance in externals, and that by good works are meant the works
of a good will, although in externals they have appeared like the works wrought
by an evil man. All things which are done from a man's interior will, are done
from purpose ; since that will proposes to itself what it acts by its intention ; and
all things which are done from the understanding, are done from confirmation,
since the understanding confirms. From these considerations it may appear,
that evil or good is imputed to every one according to the quality of his will
therein, and according to the quality of his understanding concerning them.
These observations I am allowed to confirm by the following relation : In the
spiritual world I have met several, who in the natural world had lived like oth
ers, being sumptuous in their apparel, costly in their entertainments, frequenting
the exhibitions of the stage, jesting on love topics as from a libidinous principle.

with other like practices ; and yet the angels charged those things to some as
evils of sin, and to some they did not impute them as evils, and declared the lat
ter guiltless, but the former guilty. Being questioned why they did so, when yet
all had done alike, they replied, that they view all from purpose, intention, or
end, and distinguish accordingly; and that therefore they excuse or condemn
those whom the end either excuses or condemns, since an end of good influ
ences all in heaven, and an end of evil all in hell." — C. L. 527.
The character of the man, then, is the character of his will, or in other words
of his ruling love, and this character is continually being formed and inscribed
upon his inmost being, by the course of his acting in the present life. This char
acter is latent to human view while man sojourns upon the earth, and there
fore it is evermore unlawful for a fellow-being to pronounce upon
it,
as we are
taught in what follows:—
" The Lord says, Judge not that te may not be condemned (Matt. vii.
1)
;
by
which words cannot in anywise be meant judgment respecting any one's moral
and civil life in the world, but judgment respecting his spiritual and celestial life.
Who does not see, that unless it was allowed a man to judge respecting the
moral life of those who live with him in the world, society would perish
1
What
would society be,
if
there were no public judicature, and
if
every one did not
exercise his judgment respecting another? But to judge what
is
the quality of
the interior mind, or soul, thus what
is
the quality of any one's spiritual state,
and thence what his lot
is
after death,
is
not allowed, since
it
is
known to the
Lord alone
;
neither does the Lord reveal this tijl after the person's decease, to
the intent that every one may act from a free principle in all he acts, and thereby
thatgoodorevil maybe from him, and thus in him, and that thence he may live to
himself and live his own to eternity. The reason why the interiors of the mind,
which are kept hid in the world, are revealed after death, is, because this
is
of
concern and advantage to the societies into which man then comes
;
for all in
those societies are spiritual. That those interiors are then revealed,
is
manifest
from these words of the Lord,
'
There
is
nothing concealed, which shall not be
revealed, or hidden, which shall not be known; therefore whatsoever things ye
have said in darkness, shall be heard in light
;
and what ye have spoken to the
ear in closets, shall be preached on the house-tops' (Luke xii.
2,
3). Acommon
judgment, as this for instance,
'
If
you are such in internals as you appear to be
in externals, you will be saved or condemned,'
is
allowed
;
but a particular
judgment, as this for instance,
'
You are such in internals, therefore you will be
,saved or condemned,'
is
not allowed. Judgment concerning the spiritual life of
man, or the internal life of the soul,
is
meant by the imputation which
is
here
treated of. Can any human being know and decide who
is
a scortator in heart,
and who
is
a conjugial partner in heart
?
And yet the thoughts of the heart,
which are the purposes of the will, judge every one." —
C.
L. 523.
This then discloses to us the true nature ofthat imputation which awaits every
one in the world to come, and which our author teaches
is
as far as possible
from a mere judicial reckoning or accounting any one to be either good or evil on
any other ground than the actual intrinsic quality of the man.
It
is
no other in
fact than the simple manifestation of the truth as
it
is. The character in its in
most attributes
is
necessarily revealed, in the world of spirits, by the very law
of our being, and consequently the man virtually adjudges himself to heaven or
hell by the development which
is
made of his interior affinities with the one or
the other. Swedenborg speaking on this head, remarks
:

like manner with those who compose the society. If the mind be in any society
of heaven, it then intends and thinks in like manner with those who compose
that society ; if it be in any society of hell, it intends and thinks in like manner
with those who are in the same society ; but so long as a man lives in the world,
so long he migrates from one society to another, according to the changes of the
affections of his will and of the consequent thoughts of his mind ; but after death
his peregrinations are collected, and from the collection thereof into one, a place
is allotted him, in hell if he is evil, in heaven if he is good." — C. L. 530.
As therefore the internal character there stands out, as it were, in legible aspect,
it is subject to the exploration of good spirits, whose judgment of the man coin
cides with that of the Lord himself, because they are, in their measure, in the
divine good and truth which becomes the criterion that determines his final
allotment.
" That every one's own life remains with him after death, it is known in the
church from the Word, and from these passages therein ;
'
The Son of man will
come, and will then render to every one according to his deeds' (Matt. xvi. 27).
' I saw the books open, and all were judged according to their works' (Rev. xxi.
12, 13).
'
In the day of judgment God will render to every one according to his
works' (Rom. ii. 6; 2 Cor. v. 10). The works, according to which it will be
rendered to every one, are the life, because the life does the works, and they are
according to the life. As I have been permitted for several years to be together
with the angels, and to converse with the deceased, I can testify for certain, that
every one is then explored as to the quality of the life which he has lived, and
that the life which he has contracted in the world, abides with him to eternity.
I have conversed with those who have lived ages ago, whose life I have been
acquainted with from history, and I have known it to be like the description
given of it; and I have heard from the angels, that no one's life after death can
be changed, because it is organized according to his love and consequent works ;
and that if it were changed, the organization would be rent asunder, which can
not be done in any case ; also that a change of organization cannot possibly be
effected except in the material body, and is utterly impossible in the spiritual
body, after the former has been rejected. That to an evil person is then imput
ed the evil of his life, and to a good person is imputed the good of his life, it is
to be observed, that the imputation of evil is not accusation, incusation, inculpa
tion, and judication, as in the world, but evil itself produces this effect; for the
evil, from their free principle, separate themselves from the good, inasmuch as
they cannot be together. The delights of the love of evil are averse from the
delights of the love of good ; and delights exhale from every one, as odors do
from every vegetable in the world ; for they are not absorbed and concealed by
the material body as heretofore, but flow forth freely from their loves into the
spiritual aura: and whereas evil is there made sensible as in its odor, it is this
which accuses, incuses, fixes blame, and judges —not before any judge, but be
fore every one who is principled in good ; and this is what is meant by imputa
tion. Moreover, an evil person chooses companions, with whom he may live
in his delights : and because he is averse from the delight of good, he spontane
ously betakes himself to his own in hell. The imputation of good is effected in
like manner, and takes place with those who in the world have acknowledged
that all good in them is from the Lord, and nothing from themselves. These,
after they have been prepared, are let into the interior delights of good, and then
there is opened to them a way into heaven, to the society where its homogene
ous delights are : this is effected by the Lord." — C. L. 524.
The result of the whole is summed up in what follows, from which it appears
that judgment proceeds according to the real internal state and quality of the
will by^vhich action is prompted, for it is from this that their character is viewed
and estimated by Him who " searcheth the hearts and trieth the reins of the chil
dren of men."

242 REPLY TO DR. WOODS.
" Now since all in hell are influenced by a will of evil, all are viewed there
from that will ; and since alt in heaven are influenced by a will of good, all are
viewed there from that will; wherefore imputations after death take place ac
cording to the quality of every one's will and understanding. The case is simi
lar with scortations, whether they be fornications, pellicacies, concubinages, or
adulteries ; for those things are imputed to every one, not according to the deeds
themselves, but according to the state of the mind in the deeds; for deeds follow
the body into the tomb, whereas the mind rises again. Appearances in exter
nals conclude nothing concerning imputation : the one single thing which con
cludes is the conjugial principle, in that it abides in every one's will, and is
guarded, in whatever state of marriage a man is. That conjugial principle is
like a scale, in which that love is weighed ; for the conjugial principle of one man
with one wife is the storehouse of human life, and the reservoir of the Christian
religion; and this being the case, it is possible that that love may exist with one-
married partner, and not at the same time with the other ; and that it may lie
deeper hid, than that the man himself can observe anything concerning it; and
also it may be inscribed in a successive progress of the life. The reason of this
is, because that love in its progress accompanies religion, and religion, as it is
the marriage of the Lord and the church, is the initiament and inoculation of that
love ; wherefore coujugial love is imputed to every one after death according
to his spiritual rational life ; and for him, to whom that love is imputed, a mar
riage in heaven is provided after his decease, whatever has been his marriage
in the world. From these considerations then results this short concluding ob
servation, that no inference is to be drawn concerning any one, from appear
ances of marriages, nor from appearances of scortations, whereby to decide that
he has conjugial love or not ; wherefore Judge not, lest ye be condemned (Matt.
vii. 1)."— C. L.530, 531.
I know not that any special comment upon these extracts is called for. If
they do not approve themselves by their own evidence to the reflecting mind, it
is not probable that their claims to belief could be enforced by any remarks of
mine. Yet the principles advanced in them obviously lie at the foundation of
the whole subject. The leading drift of Swedenborg's doctrine is, that although
Truth is in itself as immutable as its source, yet in its descent into the minds
of all created beings it is accommodated to their states of reception. The degree
of every man's duty is measured by the degree of truth of which he is in posses
sion; he fulfils his duty in proportion a« he is faithful to that truth. Thoughts
and actions are regarded as more or less sinful according as they are more or
less opposed to revealed truth, and according also to the purity and elevation of
the truths to which they are opposed. In judging, therefore, of the character of
the moral actions of different men, we are led to inquire as to the degree in
which their minds are opened to the light of truth, which involves an admission
of the fact, that truth is variously accommodated to the state of mind of the re
cipient, and that the same measure of virtue, or exemption from vice, is not to
be expected of all. Whatever degree of truth, however, be actually received, it'
is adapted, in its own nature, to raise every man from the state of evil in which
he may be to a higher state. Its office is continually to lessen the interval of
separation or spiritual distance from the Lord, and to elevate and bring back and
save the soul as far and as fast as it can be done consistently with the preserva
tion of freedom. The message of truth is essentially the same to men of all char
acters and conditions. It says to all ; "Repent ; put away the evil of your do
ings from before mine eyes ; if any man will come after me, let him deny him
self, and take up his cross, and follow me." But in accordance with the internal
state of every one, it requires of him less, for the time being, than of one who is

bi a higher state. But one degree of obedience to truth received prepares the
way for a higher and purer form of
it,
and for a corresponding obedience
;
and
in the other life judgment or imputation will be strictly according to the degree of
obedience rendered to the light of truth enjoyed. " A man," says Swedenborg,
" from rational conviction, according to circumstances and contingencies, may
absolve a person when
a
judge, whilst he sits in judgment, cannot absolve from
the law
;
and also a judge may absolve a person who after death
is
condemned.
The reason is, because
a
judge gives sentence according to actions done, where
as after death everyone
is
judged according to the intentions of the will, and
thence of the understanding, and according to the confirmations of the under
standing and thence of the will. These intentions and confirmations a judge
does not see
;
nevertheless each judgment
is
just, one for the sake of the good
of civil society, the other for the sake of the good of heavenly society." The
leading idea
is
well expressed in the following paragraphs
:
—" To those who are
in a less degree of evil, or are less confirmed in evil, truth
is
accommodated so
as to teach just so much as they are in
a
state to comprehend and improve.
It
teaches them to repent, and how to repent.
It
does not at first, disclose to them
the highest degrees of purity, nor any degree distinctly, except that which
is
the
next above their own state.
It
teaches them to fear becoming more evil, and
how to avoid
it
;
and
it
also shows them plainly what
is
the next less evil
state, and how to shun their present measure of evil and advance to that state. —
I
do not mean to be understood strictly as saying- that this
is
the exact order in
which men are enlightened. Some who are very evil, do understand truth
which they will not improve, and hence are made worse by it. But the Divine
Providence guards evil men against being thus enlightened, so far as
it
can
guard them and still allow their free agency. Truth as
it
thus comes down to
the conditions of men in various degrees and kinds of evil, does, at first, exact
greater degrees of holiness or purity of some, than of others
;
but its end with
each one
is
the same.
It
teaches each one to rise
,•
and having taught him and
enabled him to rise one degree,
it
teaches and enables him\o rise another degree.
It
indulges less evils to prevent greater; and teaches man continually that,
al
though he can never become absolutely good, yet he can shun evils, and receive
good from the Lord. And by shunning the evil actions to which his present
evil affections lead, he will continually advance in the work of repentance and
reformation, provided he shuns them because they are sins against God.
" To the Jews many laws and permissions were given, not because they were
right or orderly in themselves, but because the state of Jewish minds required
them. They could not receive purer truths or precepts of life. Because of the
hardness of their hearts Moses wrote those things. Such were the laws respect
ing sacrifices, and some of the laws respecting retaliation. Such also were the
permissions concerning concubinage, and putting away their wives for slight
causes. (See Matt. xix. 3-12). Without proceeding farther with this view,
I
say that Divine truth, in that degree of
it
which descended to the Jewish state of
character, required a less degree of purity than
it
requires of angels, or of any
men who are elevated in any degree above Jewish character. Men of every re
ligious sect act on this principle, so far as they follow the Lord, in judging of their
fellow-men. Who

propensities to certain evils, —his bad education, —his long habits of sin before

since he commenced it—and on many other considerations. And where is the
wrong of saying to our neighbor, '
My friend, you are greatly immersed in evil,
and are sadly enslaved by it. You can, however, do better than you are accus
tomed to do : You can avoid the present gross degree of your evil, and do thus

"—{Remarks on Several Common Er
rors respecting the Writings
of
Swedenborg, p. 42, 46.)
The principle in all this is,
I
think, easily perceived to be a sound one, and
that
it
is
Scriptural appears from its being said of the servant that knew his
Lord's will and did
it
not, that he should " be beaten with many stripes," while
" he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with
few stripes." The law of this proceeding
is
then stated
;
" Unto whom much
is
given, of him shall be much required." So again, our Lord says to the Jews,
"If ye were blind, ye should have no sin; but now ye say, We see
;
therefore
your sin remaineth." This principle evidently lies at the foundation of all that
Swedenborg has taught concerning the grounds of judicial imputation in respect
to the class of sins and evils treated of in the work on Scortatory Love, and
I
leave
it
to be pronounced upon according to the verdict formed in your own
and every intelligent mind.
I
had intended to notice, at an earlier stage of the discussion, one other pas
sage occurring in the preface to your work, and to which
I
cannot but advert,
though
it
must be briefly.
It
bears directly on the topic which
I
have last con
sidered.
" The precepts of Swedenborg respecting works of charity and various other
duties, are generally what they should be. But his precepts, or rather the per
missions he gives, respecting the intercourse of the sexes in particular cases, must
be reprobated by every pure and pious mind. And
I
should by no means have
deemed
it
proper to publish them in these Lectures, had not judicious men who
have been consulted, given advice in favor of it, and had
it
not been plainly de
manded by fidelity to the cause of truth. And should any admirer of Sweden
borg attempt to apologize for him by saying, that the principles of Scortatory
love which he has published, come up from the hells, or are dictated by evd
spirits
;
my reply is, that we are far from wishing the morals of the hells to be
published for the use of men on the earth, who are quite enough inclined to
travel the downward road, without the help of
a
book, written by the Prophet
of the New Jerusalem church, and containing the precepts or permissions of
devils. Nor can we think
it
any credit to Swedenborg, that he should have a
voluntary agency in bringing out principles of such an infernal character before
the face of the world, and should do
it
not only without blushing, but expressly
with his own sanction." —p.
6.
I
should probably be greatly at
a
loss to point to any single paragraph in your
book, so laden with matter of astonishment as this.
I
can scarcely doubt that
you will yourself share in the astonishment upon a cool review. The develop
ment of hellish promptings equivalent to teaching,
i.
e. inculcating, the morals of
the hells
!
The intimation has but to be named to make palpable its absurdity.
Who ever heard of such
a

borg that " he should have a voluntary agency in bringing out principles of such
an infernal character before the face of the world." And what then, I pray you,
becomes of the credit of Paul in reciting such a catalogue of the works of the
flesh as the following ;—" Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, here
sies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, re veilings, and such like; of which I tell
you before as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things
shall not inherit the kingdom of God." Are not these things from hell ? Are they
not the inbreathed lustings of the devil, the " god of this world, who rules in the
children of disobedience ?" But is the apostle in reciting them inculcating upon
his fellow-men a system of infernal morality ? Does he endorse " the doctrines
of devils," and endeavor to make them pass current among good Christians by
the weight of his sanction and authority ? Is it the same thing to detect and ex
pose and characterise the subtle influences of the spirits of darkness, in order to
put men on their guard against them, and to approve, patronize, and enjoin them ?
Does not the wisdom of Solomon inform us, that " in vain is the net spread in
sight of any bird ?" Can men be secured against the assaults of hell unless its
diabolical wiles and influxes are clearly pointed out ? Must we be left ignorant
of Satan's devices for fear that the exposure of them will be mistaken for a com
mendation of their cunning and craft? Is the man who publishes a " counterfeit-
detector" liable to an indictment for endeavoring to palm bad bills upon the com
munity? I confess myself altogether nonplussed by your logic in this passage.
What can be your meaning in speaking of Swedenborg's work on this subject as
" containing the precepts or permissions of devils ?" It contains no precepts at all,
and as to permissions, he speaks of the permissions of heaven, and not of hell.
How this is to be understood, I have already explained. It is a doctrine which
cannot be objected to without arraigning at once the clearest demonstrations of
the Divine providence and the most express letter of the Old Testament. Do
you suppose that Moses was teaching " the morals of the hells" when he author
ized the giving of a concubine by a father to his son, as a succedaneum for a
wife till he became subsequently married to another ? Let it be shown that
Swedenborg has uttered one sentence by way of absolute approval of any of the
forms of scortation which he declares to originate from infernal sources, and we
shall then admit the charge in all its gravamen, but not till then.
On the subject of Adultery and the remaining forms of Scortatory transgression,
I do not deem it needful to enlarge. They all come into the same general cate
gory with the preceding, and I believe that as Swedenborg condemns adultery
in all its forms, and degrees, as also all kinds of violations of female innocence,
and that too under the most fearful sanctions, comparatively little fault is found
with this department of his work. To one sentence, however, quoted above
from your Lectures, I must for a moment advert. It refers to the fact of Sweden
borg's maintaining that the crime of adultery is distinguished by different degrees
of mildness and aggravation. " Our author goes still further, and palliates the
crime of adultery in other circumstances ; namely, '
when a wife by craftiness
captivates a man's mind, enticing him into her bed-chamber, and inflaming his
passions, or when a man entices another man's wife and inflames her passions.
These and like circumstances, he says, —operate as reasonable apologies in
favor of the party seduced.' " This, however, is not his language. " That

these and like contingent circumstances lessen the grievousness of adultery, and
give a milder turn to the predications of the blame thereof, in favor of the party
seduced, is agreeable to the dictates and conclusions of reason." And, pray, is
it not ? Does not every man assent to the truth of the principle ? I do not ask
whether such circumstances excuse the crime, but do they not palliate it ?—which
is all that Swedenborg affirms. Let the reader judge for himself of the soundness
of what follows.
" There are two principles, which, in the beginning, with every man who from
natural is made spiritual, are at strife together, which are commonly called the
spirit and the flesh ; and since the love of marriage is of the spirit, and the love
of adultery is of the flesh, in such case there is also a combat between those
loves. If the love of marriage conquers, it gains dominion over and subjugates
the love of adultery, which is effected by its removal ; but if it happens, that the
lust of the flesh is excited to a heat greater than what the spirit can control from
reason, it follows that the state is inverted, and the heat of lust infuses allur-
ments into the spirit, to such a degree, that it is no longer master of its reason
and thence of itself: this is meant by adulteries of the second degree, which are
committed by those who indeed are able to consult the understanding, but by
reason of contingent causes at the moment are not able. But the matter may be
illustrated by particular cases; as in case a meretricious wife by craftiness
captivates a man's mind enticing him into her bed-chamber, and inflam
ing his passions to such a degree as to leave him no longer master of his judg
ment ; and especially if, on such occasion, she threatens to expose him if he
does not consent : in like manner, in case any meretricious wife is well skilled
in deceitful allurements, or by powerful stimulants inflames the man to such a
degree, that the raging lust of the flesh deprives the understanding of the free
use of reason : in like manner, in case a man, by powerful enticements, so far
works upon another's wife, as to leave her no longer mistress of herself, by rea
son of the fire kindled in her will ; besides other like cases. That these and
similar contingent circumstances lessen the grievousness of adultery, and give a
milder turn to the predications of the blame thereof in favor of the party seduced,
is agreeable to the dictates and conclusions of reasons." — C. L. 488.
Is it possible that you should have any question as to the truth of the distinc
tion here asserted ? Is it not the universal sense of mankind, that every crime is
more or less aggravated according to the circumstances accompanying it ? Does
not every judge in the land act on this principle, and do not all laws recognize
its validity ? Who does not know that even the taking of human life, is regard
ed as more or less a heinous crime according to its circumstances ? Does not a
fixed and deliberate purpose, prompted by malice prepense, constitute the slayer
a murderer, whereas if the rash act has been perpetrated in a moment of sud
den excitement, when the judgment was overthrown by the violence of passion, a
verdict of manslaughter only is rendered ? Do you really suppose that no heavier
condemnation should be awarded to David, who committed adultery with Bath-
sheba of set purpose, while her husband was fighting the battles of his country,
and who procured that husband to be slain to conceal his baseness, than should
have been meted out to Joseph, had he fallen before the enticements and threat-
enings of his mistress ? If so, your standard of the criminality of actions must
be a very strange one ; and yet I am unable to see upon what other grounds
you can object to the positions of Swedenborg, which are more distinctly
enounced, in the ensuing paragraph.

them ; such therefore as the internal man is in the deeds done by the external,
such are the deeds viewed in themselves : but since the internal* man with his
intention does not appear before man, every one must be judged in a human
court from deeds and words according to the law in force and its provisions :
the interior sense of the law is also to be regarded by the judge. But to illustrate
the case by examples : if adultery be committed by a youth, who does not know
as yet that adultery is a greater evil than fornication; if the like be committed
by a man of extreme simplicity ; if it be committed by a person who is deprived
by disease of the full powers of judgment ; or by a person, as is sometimes the
case, who is delirious by fits, and is at the time in a state of actual delirium ; yet
further, if it be committed in a fit of insane drunkenness, and so forth ; it is evi
dent, that in such cases, the internal man, or mind, is notpresent in the external,
scarcely any otherwise than in an irrational person. Adulteries in these instances
are predicated by a rational man according to the above circumstances ; never
theless the perpetrator is charged with blame by the same rational man as a
judge, and is punished by the law; but after death those adulteries are imputed
according to the presence, quality, and faculty of understanding in the will of
the perpetrators." — C. L. 48G.
And here my limits compel me to waive any farther discussion of the present
topic. I have aimed to exhibit fairly and faithfully the teachings of Swedenborg,
even in their most offensive features, together with the fundamental principles
on which his positions are founded, relative to those laws of permission which he
declares applicable, in certain circumstances, to the intercourse of the sexes. In
doing this I beg to be understood as assuming nothing more than the attempt to
present, in their just bearings, an expose of his real sentiments and inculcations
on this subject. I adopt nothing more of his doctrines on this, nor in fact on any
other head, than I see to be sustained by satisfactory evidence of truth as address
ed to my calm and unbiassed reason. In regard to everything that Sweden
borg has written, it must eventually stand or fall by its own intrinsic merits.
The labors of his adherents may subserve its interests by setting his utterances
occasionally in a clearer light —by confirmations and illustrations drawn from
other quarters —by disabusing the public mind of false impressions as to their
genuine drift—but originating, as, in our esteem, they do, from a source incom
parably higher than human reason, human reason can add nothing directly to
the internal evidence, much less to the authority, with which they address them
selves to the seriously pondering mind. We have defended them mos\. success
fully when we have propounded them most clearly. As the result, however, of
a careful, deliberate, and, I think T may say, impartial, inquiry into the purport
and scope of the treatise on " Scortatory Love," I am free to declare myself un
able to see the peculiar dangerous tendency charged upon
it.

that Swedenborg has done more than this —that he has not only laid down the
abstract proposition, but has also assumed to designate the specific kinds of
these permissions, and so to discriminate-the various grades of evil in point of
demerit as in effect to authorise and allow the lesser, I can only say in reply, that
this charge cannot be made good against him on any other grounds than those on
which it may be preferred against Moses. A providential allowance is indeed
asserted, but its moral conditions are so expressly defined that whoever avails
himself of it must do it upon his own responsibility, and this is attended with
extreme peril. Yet even this I think could never have been properly attempted
in the full and specific manner which Swedenborg has done, but upon the
ground of a conscious illumination enabling him to lay open the principles on
which all actions coming under this head are judged in the other life. There is
frequently an explicit, and all along through the treatise a tacit, reference to those
principles which are embodied in the closing chapter on Judgment and Impu
tation, and from which I have quoted so freely in the preceding pages. This
chapter is a kind of rear-guard to the marshalled array of propositions forming
the body of the work, and the task of refutation must be commenced in the de
nial and disproof of these principles. ]?or ourselves we are assured that the dis
closures it contains could never have proceeded from one who had not been
supematurally instructed in the sublimest truths of the spiritual world, and con
sequently that they cannot be viewed apart from a character of authority on this
and all other subjects on which he has treated.

LETTER IX.
Rev. and Dear Sir :
The extent to which I have followed out the train of your strictures on the
doctrines of Swedenborg, and the minute attention which I have hitherto paid
to every important objection urged, have already carried me so far beyond the
limits that I had originally proposed to myself, that I am compelled to a some
what abrupt conclusion of my remarks. There are several additional items in
your Lectures to which I should have been glad to be able to reply at length, as
I am not aware of a single point of objection in the whole volume which I should
hesitate for a moment to meet on the ground of the fairest argumentation.
But I must content myself mainly with what I have already written, and this, I
am happy to think, embraces an answer not only to all tKe important objections
against our system urged by yourself, but also to all the more standing and pop
ular protests which are- every where bruited by our opponents against the doc
trines in question. Many of these have already been answered, and probably in
a more able manner, by former apologists, and in ordinary cases I should say
that there was an obligation on the part of new assailants to bestow some atten
tion upon the replies already given by New Churchmen to the very arguments
which they perpetually bring forward, as if they had never before been pro
pounded or responded to. Thus your own volume, for instance, does not seem
to recognize the fact that substantially the same things that you have said have

been said again and again by your predecessors in the controversy, and have
been again and again replied to. Why do not the just laws of polemics require
you to advert to those replies, and to show wherein they fail to annul the force of
the objections urged ? Yet the whole tenor of your Lectures is just what it might
have been if Clowes, and Hindmarsh, and Noble, and Bailey, and Smithson, and
Goyder, had never penned a syllable on the subject. It evidently knows nothing
of any prior assault or any prior defence; and the case is very much the same
with the kindred work of Dr. Pond, although as his line of investigation is more
original, he has made several new points of objection, particularly in the scien
tific department. I think we have reason to complain of this, as an act of injus
tice, as you would probably yourself complain if a Unitarian writer were to re
peat all the common arguments against Orthodoxy to which you replied some
years ago in your letters to Dr. Ware, and that without paying the least attention
to your published defence. Still I do not intimate any regret that an occasion
has arisen which has led to the present Reply to your pamphlet. It has doubt
less given me an opportunity of saying some things which had not been said
before—of putting some things in a true light which had been wrongly repre
sented —-and above all of making Swedenborg the pleader of his own cause in
the extended array of citations from his works, which may find their way to
numerous inquiring minds with some degree, I trust, of useful effect. They can,
at any rate, scarcely fail to correct many false impressions, and to beget the be
lief that the system he has announced is marked by features of so wonderful a
character, that its claims to investigation can no longer be properly staved off.
This is the grand point upon which his advocates insist. They do not challenge
reception forthwith, but they do demand inquiry. They most confidently af
firm that the phenomena connected with the man, and the problems involved
in the system, imperiously call for some solution other than that which has hith
erto been offered by the deniers of his high assumptions. The plea of insanity
has for the most part been condescendingly put in, in his behalf, by such of his
opponents as have seen too much obvious sincerity and profound sense in his
works to allow the open charge of sheer imposture. But nothing more, I am
persuaded, is necessary than the simple perusal of the extracts I have given to
compel the testimony from every candid mind that " these are not the words of one
that is mad, or of him that hath a devil." No madness that the world has wit
nessed ever uttered itself in the language of such surpassing wisdom ; and that it
is wisdom I defy any one to deny who has given it more than a cursory glance.
Here too is the indubitable fact that growing numbers of intelligent and cool-
judging minds —minds of the most serious complexion, at the farthest remove
from enthusiastic tendencies, and trained to habits of rigid requisition of evi
dence—are everywhere awaking to the conviction, that both the man and the
doctrine have been misapprehended, misrepresented, and condemned without a
fair hearing, and are embracing the system without reserve. They are ready at
once to declare that however formidable appears the prima facie evidence against
it, and of which they are no less sensible than others, yet to their calmest judg
ment the evidence in its favor overwhelmingly bears down the evidence against
it. This, I maintain, is a fact that requires in some way to be accounted for.
How have they come to this result ? It cannot be said to be from a cursory and
superficial view of the revelations; for they will with one accord declare that

upon such a view of the system they would infallibly have rejected it. It is pre
cisely because they have thoroughly examined and tested it, that they adopt
it.
And who, they ask, that has not gone through a similar process
is
entitled to sit
in judgment on their decision
?
How
is
one competent to pronounce a fair ver
dict on the conclusions to which they have come,
if
he has not studiously weigh
ed the reasons that have determined them
?
Now we know that our opponents
have not done this, because we invariably see that in all their assaults they do
not treat the reasons, but wage their war with the conclusions. Thus, for instance,
not
a
syllable is ever uttered on the subject of Swedenborg's psychology. Yet
this lies at the foundation of the whole scheme. Nothing
is
said on the princi
ple of correspondence, while this
is
the fundamental law of the spiritual sense of
the Word, which constitutes a prime feature of his disclosures. And so of nu
merous other items which mark the system. Let us be encountered on the pri
mary grounds of our belief by those who really understand what they are, and
somewhat of
a
true issue will be made. But
I
must be allowed to say, that up
on this basis we anticipate few adversaries.
It
is
not from those who have fully
put themselves in possession of our creed, and of the grounds of it, that we
count upon opposition. This will doubtless ever be dictated, as
it
ever has been,
by
a
prejudice that refuses to invoke knowledge into its counsels. In regard to
your own work, while
I
do not retract the concession made in the outset, that
it
does not deal in vituperation, nor dispense with argument,
I
am still constrained
to say that
it
does not, in the main, touch the true merits of the theme.
It
sup
poses the error of Swedenborg's system, on a multitude of points, simply because
it
differs from accredited tenets. On these heads you evidently deem the system
unworthy of being reasoned with. On other points
it
fails to convey the right
impression on the score of facts as to what he does really teach. In confirma
tion of all this
I
have only to appeal to your concluding remarks, in which you
specify to your pupils what they must do "
if
they would yield themselves up
to Swedenborg as
a
divinely commissioned teacher, and confide in him as the
great prophet of the only true church."
(1.) "You must exclude from the word of God one sixth part of the Old Testa
ment and half of the New." Not a syllable
is
to be excluded from either. A dis
tinction in the degree of inspiration
is
maintained in reference to the several books,
but the fact of their all being inspired in some degree
is
not denied.
(2.) "You must hold Swedenborg as superior to all the inspired teachers who
were raised up before him." No such' comparison
is
required to be made.
It
is
simply requisite to recognize such claims as are established by appropriate
evidence. Whatever the degree of his illumination,
it
was such, we hold, as the
Lord saw fit to impart to him, and whether the measure of
it
were superior or
inferior to that of apostles and prophets,
is
a question in itself of comparatively
little moment. Like them, we hold that he spake " according to the wisdom
given him." Our only question concerns the truth of what he has said and the
source of it. He institutes no such comparisons himself, nor do we.
(3.)
" You must receive all his interpretations of the word of God as infallible."
And why not,
if
we admit that they are the product of a supernatural state into
which he was brought by God himself, and for the express purpose of laying
open the laws of a spiritual interpretation vastly transcending that of the letter
?
The evidence of the truth of his interpretations depends upon the evidence of
the reality of his illumination, and when

an illumination could be consistent with a fallacious mode of unfolding the in
terior purport of the Scriptures, we shall feel at liberty to doubt whether it be in
deed infallible. Meantime we shall continue to regard his interpretations as in
fallible, till some stronger reason is given for believing the reverse.
(4.)
" You must follow him in regard to the doctrines of religion." These
you go on to specify as follows; —" As he rejects the common doctrine of the
Trinity, denying the distinct personality not only of the Holy Spirit, but also of
the Father and the Son; so must you. As he rejects that centre- doctrine of the
Gospel, the doctrine of the atonement, or the vicarious sufferings of Christ as a
propitiation for sin; so must you. As he rejects the doctrine of Justification by
Faith, that great doctrine of the New Testament and of the churches of the Re
formation ; you must do the same. As he rejects the evidence of miracles as
what carries compulsion with it and takes away man's free will ; so must you.
As he rejects the worship of an invisible God, a pure and perfect Spirit, and main
tains that God is very man, and is worshiped as a man by all in heaven, and by
all the men of the church; you must do likewise. As he sternly rejects the
common doctrine of Native Depravity, and the doctrine of Divine Sovereignty
and Predestination ; so must you. As he holds a doctrine very like the Popish
doctrine of Purgatory; so must you. That the present life is the only time of
probation, you can no longer believe. And you can no longer say to men, with
the awakening emphasis which the language usually carries with it, Behold now
is the accepted time.1 Behold now is the day of salvation ! Repent, and prepare to meet
-your God."—p. 163. Now in regard to every one of these points I would respect
fully submit whether I have not shown in my preceding pages that your allega
tions are calculated to convey an entirely erroneous impression of the truth.
He does indeed reject the " common doctrine of the Trinity, denying the distinct
personality, not only of the Holy Spirit, but also of the Father and the Son," and
I trust to have shown that he had very good reasons for so doing, and that not
Swedenborg, but yourself and the soi-disant orthodox churches, take unscriptural
ground on this head. But as to all the other items, I am unable to see wherein
I have failed in showing either that you have not represented the fact of his
teachings correctly, or that where you have, the intrinsic truth is on the side of
Swedenborg, and not on that of his gainsayers. I leave
it,
however, to the
judgment of the reader.
(5.)
" You must follow your teacher also in the denial of the Resurrection of
the body." Certainly we follow him in the denial of the resurrection of the
material body, because we follow him in the assertion of the resurrection of the
spiritual body, other than which we know nothing of any body at all after death.
If you do, and can enlighten us by the light either of Scripture or reason on the
subject we shall " lend an attent ear" to all such elucidations. As at present
advised, we find in the sacred writers no announcement of any body to be rais
ed but a spiritual one, and as all our rational inductions agree with Swedenborg
in assuring us that such a body
is
actually involved and enwrapped in the ma
terial body, and as the separation of these bodies takes place at death, we infer
that the only resurrection ever to occur will occur at death. We are not dis
turbed by any intimation that this view
is
contrary to the plain language of
Scripture, for our concern
is
no less with what Scripture means than with what
it
says.

principles respecting the love of onr neighbor, and the duties of morality flow
ing from
it,
and in general respecting the domestic relations, does, after all,
allow unmarried men, in cases which often occur, to keep a mistress, and ac
commodates married men in the same way, when they have 'just and consci
entious reasons,' as he thinks they frequently have." My reply to this must be
fresh upon the reader's mind. He has by this time found himself able to judge
how far Swedenborg grants allowance and accommodation either to married or un
married men. But you add, "
I
do not say that the followers of Swedenborg
must, in their own practice, conform to what
is
corrupt and abominable in his
moral code
;
but
I
say they must admit
it
as a part of Swedenborg's theory, and
must hold that
it
is
allowable to conform to it." Allowable to whom, and under
what conditions
?
This is the core of the whole matter, and on this point you
have, whether wisely or otherwisely, suppressed all qualifications, and thus present
ed a glaringly distorted view of the whole scope of his statements. But the
grounds of a truer judgment are now before the reader, and
it
may be presumed
that he will give them their due weight.
You sum up the whole in the following words
:
—
" Such as
I
have mentioned, are the doctrines of Scripture and of the Christian
church, which you must reject, and such the moral and religious principles
which you must embrace,
if
you become consistent followers of Swedenborg.
In some respects your principles must nearly agree with those of Sabellians
;
in
some respects, with those of Unitarians
;
in some respects, with those of liber
tines
;
and in some respects, you must adopt principles, which neither Prophets
nor Apostles, neither men nor angels, ever before taught in our world, but which
were revealed to the great Teacher of the New Jerusalem church." —p. 164.
Our affinities, according to this, are quite multifarious, and so far as the ele
ments of goodness and truth exist in any system of religion, we should probably
admit a harmonizing tendency even to
a
greater extent than you have indicat
ed, with the exception, however of the sect of " libertines," with which we are
unable to recognize the points of contact. Indeed we see for ourselves rather
more relationship in that direction in Luther's grand doctrine of justification by
faith alone, at least as held by himself. " Now thou seesthow rich is the Chris

REPLY TO DR. WOODS. 253
behalf of the cause for which I plead, to those sentiments of devout reverence
for whatever " God the Lord hath spoken," which I am sure pervade your bosom.
I cannot do you the injustice to doubt, that you would not knowingly turn a
deaf ear to any message that you had the least reason to believe was really from
God and designed to make known his mind to his creatures. You would not
need to be previously assured that every such communication was dictated by
infinite benevolence, was intended for our highest good, and, coming from
the Most High himself, was pre-eminently worthy of all acceptation. I can
easily picture to myself the retrospective regret of a devoutly ingenuous and
deeply pious mind in case it should ultimately receive the conviction that it had
unwittingly .put away from itself a bona fide revelation from the Lord of hosts,
and that too under the influence of a general state of mind which would have
leaped to the recognition of the truth, had it but rationally perceived it. Now
in the present case I think you must admit that there is at least a possibility that
Emanuel Swedenborg may have been a veritable messenger from God to man.
You cannot, I am persuaded, put your finger upon any express declaration of
the Word which absolutely forbids the expectancy of any farther disclosures by
the Lord himself of the spiritual world, the scene of our immortal existence.
Such disclosures may then be made, and if so, what more probable than that they
should be made through the agency of some individual raised up and remarka
bly endowed as a selected medium for the purpose. The question then occurs
as to the nature of the evidence by which such a claim is to be substantiated. I
think I have proposed some valid reasons for doubting whether the evidence of
miracles would be fairly to be expected at this day, in proof of a divine mis
sion. It would be rather an evidence involved in the intrinsic character of the
doctrines announced ; and one of its distinguishing features would be apt to be
the development of the relation between the inner constituent principles of our
nature and the great truths of revelation —a development unfolding the precise
manner in which our future destiny is controlled by our present character. But
this could scarcely be done without at the same time disclosing the fundamental
relation between all natural and spiritual truth, between the two worlds of
matter and of mind, and this is virtually showing the indissoluble connection
between science and revelation. It is clothing theology with the character of a
divine philosophy. And this we believe has been accomplished in the sublime
apocalypse of which Swedenborg has been made the instrument. The great
problems of Creation, of Life, of Affection, of Thought, of Free Will, of Redemp
tion, of Regeneration, of Providence, have been solved, if he has uttered truth.
The enucleation of the profounder mysteries of our being in all its ramified rela
tions is no longer banned by the inscription, hitherto read over the entrance of
the Temple of Truth, " Non Licet," but is ceded by the cheering title, " Nunc
Licet."* The door is open, and he that is reverently disposed to worship and
learn within the sanctuary is freely permitted to enter.
This then is the leading character of the evidence which Swedenborg affords
* Swedenborg in one of his visions in the spiritual world, beheld a splendid temple
illuminated by the light flowing from the interior sense of the Word, after describing
which he says; —"When I came up nearer, I saw these words written on the gate,
Nunc Licet, now it is lawful ; which signified that now it it lawful to enter intellectually
into the secrets offaith."—T. C. R. 508.

254 REPLY TO DR. WOODS.
of the truth of his mission. To a calm reflection I think it must appear as the
most appropriate and convincing species of evidence that can be adduced. At
the same time [ am fully aware of the obstacles with which the reception of
such a claim as his must inevitably have to contend. It is adverse to all our
settled preconceptions— it makes a kind of havoc of our most cherished notions
on the constitution of the universe, the doctrines of religion, and the state after
death— it strikes us, at first blush, as an actual superseding of all prior knowl
edges on the subjects of the Christian revelation— in a word, a sort of moral par
alysis seems to fall upon the entire body of our faith on the supposition that
Swedenborg is true. Still he may be true, and his truth may be of the most
transcendant moment to the world. Our own conviction on this head arises in
great measure from the utter impossibility we find of accounting for the facts of
Swedenborg's case on any other theory than that of the reality of his supernatural
insight, aud of conceiving the truth on the various subjects he has treated to be
otherwise than he affirms. And we feel strongly, in reference to any attempt to
refute our positions, the force of Mr. Mill's remark in his Logic (p. 551), that " it
is a rule both of justice and good sense, to grapple not with the absurdest, but
with the most reasonable form of a wrong opinion." The more deeply we have
investigated, the more firm the assurance that prompts the exclamation; —
" Plato, thou reasonest well ; it must be so." To our faith rendered under such
circumstances we may apply the remark made by Swedenborg himself in one
of his scientific works, that " if any one tells me the same thing that I have myself
arrived at, I am bound to believe him on the simple ground that I believe my
self." —(Philos. of the Infinite, p 64.)
With men of advanced years and confirmed opinions we can be but little san
guine in our anticipations of so great a change of views as is necessarily sup
posed in the adoption of this remarkable system. But I have been much im
pressed by the following resolution of President Edwards, a name that I doubt
not carries more than ordinary authority with you as that of a profoundly en
lightened and eminently holy man ;—" If I ever live to years, I will be impartial
to hear reasons of all pretended discoveries, and receive them, if rational, how
long soever I may have been used to another way of thinking." If this appears
to you a reasonable principle of action, I cannot entirely forego the hope that
you may yet review the tenor of your objections, and putting them in contrast
with the real character of the doctrines against which they are urged, may event
ually reach the conclusion, that if they are not true, still they have so much of
the semblance of truth, and are built upon principles so profoundly rational and
philosophical, that no man can be justified in lightly estimating or hastily
dismissing them.
In drawing my lengthened reply to a close, I have only to request that if I
have in anything done injustice to your arguments, or spoken in a manner in
consistent with the spirit of a'religion whose genius and motto is Charity, or
tmsuited to the respect and reverence which I have long sincerely cherished
towards you, you will put it to the account of anything rather than an intention
to disregard the least of the requisites to a truly Christian style of religious con
troversy. With the assurance of my high personal regard and my best wishes
for your welfare I remain,
Dear Sir, Yours, &c,
GEO. BUSH.

APPENDIX.
The case of the Landgrave of Hesse, alluded to on a preceding page, exhibit*
So curious a chapter in ecclesiastical history, and affords so striking an instance
of the practical adoption of the principles asserted by Swedenborg, that we have
been induced to present the affair somewhat more in detail as given in " Bossuet's
Variations," vol. 1. p. 231-251. Ashe adduces original docurnents,no charge
of partizan injustice can be brought against the statement. The Reply of the
Reformers to the application of the Landgrave considers his reasons at length,
and after dwelling upon the original design of the marriage institute goes on to
observe :
" Lamech was the first that married many wives, and the Scripture witnesses that
this custom was introduced contrary to the first institution. It nevertheless passed into
custom among infidel nations ; and we even find afterwards, that Abraham and his
posterity had many wives. It is also certain from Deuteronomy, that the law of Moses
permitted it afterwards, and that God made an allowance for frail nature. Since it is
then suitable to the creation of men, and to the first establishment of their society, that
each one be content with one wife, it thence follows that the law enjoining it is praise
worthy ; that it ought to be received in the Church ; and no law contrary thereto be in
troduced into it, because Jesus Christ has repeated in the nineteenth chapter of St. Mat
thew that text of Genesis, '
There shall be two in one flesh :' and brings to man's re
membrance what marriage ought to have been before it degenerated from its purity*
In certain cases however, there is room for dispensation. For example, if a married
man, detained captive in a distant country, should there take a second wife/ in order to
preserve or recover his health; or if his own become leprous, we see not how we
could condemn, in these cases, such a man as, by the advice of his Pastor, should take
another wife, provided it were not with a design of introducing a new law, but with an
eye only to his own particular necessities.
" As to what your Highness says, thaf it is not possible for you to abstain from this
impure life, we wish you were in a better state before God, that you lived with a secure
conscience, and labored for the salvation of your own soul, and the welfare of your
subjects. But after all, if your Highness is fully resolved to marry a second wife, we
judge it ought to be done secretly, as we have said with respect to the dispensation de
manded on the same account, that is, that none but the person you shall wed, and
a few trusty persons, know of the matter, and they, too, obliged to secrecy under the
seal of confession. Hence no contradiction nor scandal of moment is to be appre
hended ; for it is no extraordinary thing for Princes to keep concubines j and though
the vulgar should be scandalized thereat, the more intelligent would doubt of the truth,
and prudent persons would approve of this moderate kind of life, as preferable to adul
tery, and other brutal actions. There is no need of being much concerned for what
. men will say, provided all goes right with conscience. So far do we approve it, and in

256 APPENDIX.
those circumstances only by us specified ; for the Gotpel hath neither recalled nor forbid
what was permitted in the law of Motet with retpect to marriage. Jesus Christ has
not changed the external economy, but added justice only, and life everlasting, for
reward. He teaches the true way of obeying God, and endeavors to repair the cor
ruption of nature. Your Highness hath therefore, in this writing, not only the appro
bation of us all, in case of necessity, concerning what you desire, but also the reflections
we have made thereupon; we beseech you to weigh them, as becoming a virtuous,
wise, and Christian Prince. We also beg of God to direct all for his glory and your
Highness's salvation."
We have then a copy of the marriage contract duly attested and authenticat
ed, of which the following is the substance. It will be seen that the measure
appears to have been regarded by all the parties concerned as quite essential to
the temporal and eternal well-being of his Highness.
" Whereas the eye of God searches all things, and but little escapes the knowledge
of men, his Highness declares that his will is to wed the said Lady Margaret de Saal,
although the Princess his wifa be still living, and that this action may not be imputed
to inconstancy or curiosity, and to avoid scandal and maintain the honor of the said
Lady, and the reputation of her kindred, his Highness makes oath here before God, and
upon his soul and conscience, that he takes her to wife through no levity, nor curiosity,
nor from any contempt of law or superiors ; but that he is obliged to it by such import
ant, such inevitable necessities of body and conscience, that it is impossible for him to
save either body or soul, without adding another wife to his first. All which his High
ness hath laid before many learned, devout, prudent, and Christian preachers, and con
sulted them upon it. And these great men, after examining the motives represented to
them, have advised his Highness to put his soul and conscience at case by this double
marriage. And the same cause and the same necessity have obliged the most serene
Princess, Christina Duchess of Saxony, his Highness's first lawful wife, out of her great
prudence and sincere devotion, for which she is so much to be commended, freely to
consent and admit of a partner, to the end, that the soul and body of her most dear
spouse may run no further risk, and the glory of God may be increased, as the deed
written with this Princess's own hand sufficiently testifies. And lest occasion of scan
dal be taken from its not being the custom to have two wives, although this be Christian
and lawful in the present case, his Highness will not solemnize these nuptials in the
ordinary way, that is, publicly before many people, and with the wonted ceremonies,
with the said Margaret de Saal ; but both the one and the other will join themselves in
wedlock, privately and without noise, in presence only of the witnesses underwritten."
We forbear all comment upon this unique manifesto. It is quite obvious that
the exculpation of Luther is the justification of Swedenborg. The German
Reformer and the Swedish Innovator are here clearly in the same ship and must,
in the world's sentence, reach the haven or go to the bottom together. We shall
anxiously await the effect of the wind and tide of public judgment.
