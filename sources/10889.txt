            		Experience Description:   

  					 I became dizzy and collapsed outside on the front porch. I can remember floating up into a tube-like area with a very bright light at the end. Everything was turning around much like a tornado as I elevated up toward the light. I was soooo relaxed and very comfortable, more than I had ever felt before, and did not want to be disturbed as I could hear my Father's voice trying to bring me around - I just wanted to keep going.
