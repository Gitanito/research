I reached the end on a sort of moving staircase. I was surrounded by night stars (although the operation was taking place in the daytime) but it appeared quite light. I was greeted at the top of the staircase by seven or eight people. They appeared silver. I knew that I knew and loved them, although I did not recognize them. They were very happy to see me and I felt as though I had come home. I do not know how long I was with them. What I did have was a very strong knowledge that I understood EVERYTHING in the world. I knew the reason for every mortal thing and felt a deep sense of peace. Finally I was embraced by all but told I had to go back. I was devastated and didn't want to go. I had no thought for my family on earth (although I had two small children and husband, mother and sisters). They didn't enter my head. I was deeply upset at leaving. I was told by one person, 'It isn't the right time yet.' Then I stepped back on the staircase and started rushing back into my body. As I returned I was conscious of losing the feeling of understanding everything and was desperate to try to remember it - but it vanished. I came back into the world screaming. I heard the doctors saying I was very distressed and then nothing more.
