MAY IT PLEASE Yovn Royal/ H1GHNEss,
Presumptuous as it may appear in a
stranger
to Dedicate his humble Work to Your Royal
Highness, I was nevertheless emboldened to so-
licit Your permission to do so, when I considered
I was
addressing a Prince who, to extensive eru-
dition, has united a
refined taste-qualities which
have always adorned Your Royal and Illustrious
House, the Princes of which have not deemed it
beneath their dignity to accept ¢ and exercise,
the Rectorship of three dgferent Universities,
and several of whom have immortalized their
names in the literary world by their writings ; to
Your Royal Highness, their descendant, who,
with an
animating and laudable zeal, not only

DEDICATION.

supports and protects all that is good and noble,
all that can contribute to the extension of the
sciences, the cultivation of the mind, and
the moral .improvement of mankind, but, at the
same time, by taking a
personal and active part
therein, gives them___/irmness and duration,-to
You do I venture to dedicate this small produc-
tion of my pen, the tendency of which is, to shew
the elevated station ofman in the grand -scale of
nature ; trusting I shall be pardonedfor the in-
trusion on the sole plea, that, according to the
laws of identity, the same
magnetic power pre-
vails in the ideal, as well as in the real world, by
which the little is attracted to the great, and by
which influence I am
impelled, while, with the
most profound and unfeigned respect, I humbly
beg leave to subscribe mysem p

.PREFACE
_.i-_-1-1-1
,.
THE phenomena of Animal Magnetism,
_which in modern times have excited such
great sensation in France, Germany, and
Holland, have, however, in consequence
of the extraordinary and seemingly su-
pematural qualities which were attached
to it, been totally 'doubted by a great
many individuals, even by the most sen-
sible, and incurred their contempt. -
_
V
I remained an indifferent spectator of
all the various controversies which, for
several years past, were carried on about
this subject, until about the year 1815.
Disputes on new subjects, which are
calculated to create sensation in the pub-
lic mind, 'can never form a rule by
which one is to ascertain truth or false-
B
ii Paenen.
lmoglh what truth is there that has not
beendisputcd, and what falsehood is there
that has- not had its defenders? The
system of Nicholas Copernicus was dis-
pultedgwand in the reign of Mariade Me-
dicis they innocent milk
bread (*) /was, ion
f 1
`{») A ammbelmaia of Mafia dq Medicis slimleix fné
bread the Queen ate of it so
frequently, and
came so'tbk1d~oi'it;'tliat it was called Pain d Ia Reine,
and several oonksin France, who understood the mak-
inglnf,'i1~§ iinade theirfortrines by_it. The bakers, ellyir
outat the uccess ot;the vformer, prevailed upon some
clergyman to preach with the greatest zeal against the
niiillfbééhtl; 'as being aifood which excited lust, immo-
ral: Maas, and~witnhcraft. A superstitious notion' was
prevalent at that time, that if' an enamoured person
wrote his name on a warm loaf of this milk bread, and
the beloved object ate of it, the latter would always
renlaih bonstant. At length the faculty interfered, land
amongst them the milk bread found its advocates as
well as its opponents: at the 'head of the former was the
f§lnBlis'GhyiPatin, who proved'from'Hippocrates, that
féiliientatlbii' was detrimental to the human frame;
}'el'ahlt,`nu the contrary, asserted from Pliny, that it
was beneicial to it. The matter was at last carried so
faly that the Parliament was
obliged to interpose its
1(llhority,'and' ordered aichemical' process 'tobe' insti-
tutetl,.'the vesalrufwhibh was; thas the IIl?ll¢'bl'B¢d was

In 1815; however, my 'attention was
roused By a' case ofdiseasef which had been
obsei-veil" by Mr. Petétin,"(imd `insei'ted
by Hufeland in his Jburnal, and that np;

accoimtiof a-superficial-knowledge of the
Subject-beooming Prejudicial-/to truth, I
iliagined, that theonly remedy to-prevent
such-ill? consequences taking place con-
sisted in~~personalIy searching into the
:natural constitution of man, for the cause
,of phenomena so
apt to excite astonish-
ment. ~ - ' -- ~ .
To this I beg leave to add the circum-
ssbancey that, in-1815, the.Physieal and~Ghe-
mica! Society in Groningen granted methe

to the rules of which I was obliged -at
}east~ once
ayear to hold an 'instructive
eourseffof lectures at the meetings of the
said society. ,

Although, according to the regulations
iof"this~leamed body, the subject, which
the honorary member is to treat oil is
*fixed upon by the society itselflfin this
case it was not only left to'my own op-
tion, -but, in consequence of my having
eommunicated to many ofthem some. of

-Iflthe human race is to derive an ith#-
portantremedy for 'diseases frorirthis dis-
cdvery, itris necessary the publioshould
obtain a different opinion of it' than' is
prevalent at present. If a
physician
prescribes or administers a
remedy to his
patient, which the latter, for the"m0st
part, takes withoutiknowing its virtues,
andf merely from the confidence he'has in
the forrrier,' itissuliicient if the 'physician
has the proper knowledge of the effect of
such remedy; but it is very different if
one means to apply Animal Magnetism' as
a
remedy, for then the consent of the pa-
tientl andhis entire confidence, not only
initlie physician, but alsoin the remedy,
is absolutely necessary, 'With the efleot of
which he must therefore fbe made ac-
quainted. 'Q _

Magnetism, -
in .a treatise' -.like
this, intended only to reason on the subject,
and adapted for the closet, would be to
lay the art open to the satire ofunhelievers,
er; the ridicule ofthe Eighty, while a mere
,extended descriptionwould perhaps only
excite the self.-suilicient to-awkwandand
inadequate attempts, which would cer-
tainly end in disgrace to themselves, and
be ruinons to the science. -

Those of my readers who, by virtuc.of
their lawful calling, intend to make use
of Animal Magnetism, know the sources
whence they are to draw the necessaryiu-
formation.
For those of my readers, however, who
are tctally unacquainted with this subject,
I tind it absolutely necessary to add the
following slight description. g

may behold the whole in an exact and

from that imagine an absolute death. For
according to our

§. 10. _
From what has been said the result is
evident, that the whole universe is ani-
mated. If we therefore consider, what
experience shows us
very plainly .upon
the least observation of the phenomena in
nature, viz. that all bodies in the universe
form, as it were, an
uninterrupted coni-
catenation, the last link of which is cone
nected with the first, it thence appears,
that the whole universe ought to be consi-
dered as one general organism, no link
of which must be wanting~in order to
form the Whole. Thus, all things which
appear to our senses as single bodies
are ,mere organs of the great organism.
Every individual thing" contributes its
share towards the preservation .-of the
whcleya *grain 'of dust, as well as every
other being 'that 'may 'strike our senses
more forcibly.

great part of the community. It is generally known,
that the shark is the greatest devourer of fish, and of
lierrings in particular. Were it therefore to appear sud,-
denly amongst them, they in all probability would not
be able to save themselves, but nature has so ordered
it, that a certain little fish, called the pilot, is not
hurt by him, and wherever this little fish appears, a
shark is at hand, and at times the distance of a

In all modilications where this origi-
nal power enters, (as will be seen in the
seqnel,) it always appears in such a mani-
ner as must impress us with the idea) of
its consisting ofa dualism, orof two parts ;4
that is to say, we
may and must imagine,
it as well positive asnegative. _
_
But one must not by any means nude#
stand, by the expression positive, a
thing
which is favourable, or by the term nega-
tive, a thing which is unfavourable to
life, but only that positive and negative
are merely relative ideas, the same as
with the mathematician plus and 'minus
are.

~
As the first condition of every :entity fi-n
the universe must he the preservation of
individuality, andf as, consequently, the
first fuinction of the original power must
refer to vegetative life, it im therefore,
certainly necessary, that the process of
vegetative life, as long as the individuality
is to last, does not, cease for a moment.
But by this continued exertion of the
power to preserve its individuality amidst
the power of the external world, the dif-
ferent parts become exhausted, and only
the whole ofthe vital, or
original power,
contained in the human body, is able to
carry on vegetative- lyk, and to resign its
influence for a» time on the animal aswell
as the intellectual life ;. and this state is
whatwe call natural sleep (sommas natura-
lis): consequently the functions of the or-
gans ofsense, asalso those of the higher fa-
culties, are
suspended, and only the func-
F 2 ~
68 'rnnnisn
tions of rep_roduction remain in existence,
consciousness ceases, and the avenues
thereto, the organs of sense, are as it were
shut. Hence we
may explain the reason
why, after a
plentiful meal, wetind our-
selves inclined to sleep; becauseithe pro-
cess of digestion requires increased irital
power, which must be taken from the in-
tellectual system.

As according to the usual (course of na-
ture no alteration takes* place suddenly,
it is quite natural,,'that ~
the waking state
of man must sink into the sleeping state
by degrees. Hence there necessarily exists
between these two states a
third, which
neither belongs to waking, nor to sleeping,
and is known to us
-bythe term slumber.
In this state the functions of the superior
faculties becomeless perceptible, the or-4

sions arise, which we call dreams. The
activity of the organs of sense not being
completely suspended; it is very _easyptof

means of incentives externally applied,
and thereby restore perfect consciousness.
It is therefore very easy to wake a

'
l
By degrees, however, all functions of
the organs of sense cease
pro momento, and
a
profound sleep follows; andwe become
unconscious of all that has taken place
during the space between waking and
sleeping: for this reason we can seldom
recollect those dreams which occur before
midnight,

NUTRITION DURING SLEEP. .
As during this _state the general vital
power confines itself more to the vegeta-
70 'mnxrlss
'
tive system, the circulation of the blood
is likewise conducted with more effect to-
wards that system, and is in a like pro-
portion detracted from the higher organs.
By means of this temporary repletion in
those organs which belong to vegetative.
life, the blood is obliged to How slower,
and the disposal of animal matter is regu-
larly effected, which is requisite for the
restoration of parts exhausted by the ac-
u¢5af'1ife. Much sleep fattens the body,
little wastes it.

`
§ sa.

'
'1'he individual hereby gradually ob-
tains that proper power which belongs to
him. In consequence thereof; the vital
power being again amassed in the vegeta-
tive system, extends itself; by virtue of its
originality, to the higher organs, and by
degrees, the state of perfect consciousness
ON ANIMAL MAGNETISM. 71
is produced, which we call the state of
waking.
'

`
_It has already been observed, that
there is a middle state between waking
and sleeping, which We ,call slumber, or
dreaming; so there iss likewise another
such middle state between sleeping and
waking, with this difference, however,
that the latter state is combined with con-
sciousness. We are therefore frequently
capable of recollecting the subjects of
such dreams. Hence also most dreams oc-

Though after what has been said itne-
cessarily follows, that great exertion, as
a1so'a'p1@mifu1mea1, brings on an incli-
nation to sleep; yet there are cases, where
the bodily exercise was too great, or the
repast too plenteous, particularly where
the organs of digestion are in a weak state,
and still we are not able to
"compose
ourselves to sleep; which phenomenon,
singular as it may appear, is yet very
easy to explain : for, if the organs of vege-
tative life are too much weakened, they
also lose the susceptibility requisite for
the vital power, which Hows to it from the
organs of intellectual life, and which 'must
then be received more
slowly than usual.
During fatigue, there still remains too
much activity in the higher organs; Hence
insomnia is a
principal symptom in all
74 _
rnnnrss.
diseases of the organs of digestion, and
particularly in diseases of the spleen.
§ 57.
t
The same circumstance occurs, if too
violent an exertion of the spirits has ta-
ken place. A person so circumstanced can-
not composelhimself to sleep, because from
the too great activity of the higher 'organs
the vital power cannot separate itself so
easily. A3 a
proofthat the vital power may
by 'too much activity in these organs be
fixed as it were for a while, we may ad-
duce the state of dying persons, who yield
up the ghost in a
very diflicult manner, oc-
casioned by the .anguish which torments
their soul. Hence we may explain the phe-
nomenon which some think they must be#
lieve as a
prejudice :
namely, that at a time
when we cannot sleep, we may imagine
ourselves to be in a vessel on the open, sea,
where one san see nothing but the sky and
water, and we
very easily fall asleep. It is
natural, that as soon as there is no fixed
ON ANIMAL ~MAaNn'rlsM. 75
station* in the course ofthe ideas, the vital
power is not prevented from leaving the
higher organs.
gss.
INCITABILITY OF THE ORGANS OF SENSE
DURING SLEEP. »
Though the functions of animal life are
suspended during sleep, they' are yet not
entirely -suppressed even *in the most pro-
found sleep. The organs of sense conti-
nue to retain their faculties, and, when
strong incentives are
applied, are excited
to action : at the same time a sort ofindis-
tinct consciousness is eifected, which day
almost be put on a level with animal in-
stinct. If these i-menu-ves are of-any du-
ration, this obscure consciousness passes
over into a distinct state. But if these
incentives speedily relax, the individual
again falls asleep, and mostly remains
unconscious of all that has happened.
Omniscient Providence has very wisely
'76 'mmmsu
and beneficially .ordained it thus; for
wiifliout this arrangement we .must not
think of ever waking any body; and the.
sleeping person would be exposed to in-
finite mischie£ without being able to be
rescued from it by any one.
There is something more, »which in this
respectfhas beerfarranged for us niorluis;
iidhrély, that, is during sleep the blood coli

In the same manner as in a

the higher organs often produce in dreams
a false conjunction, or ,concatenation of
ideas, which we call tphantasm, .or false
imagination : (I say false imagination,
forimagination is not: at all times false).
I shall heremention an occurrence, by
way of elucidating what I have above

PRACTICAL 'I'AC'l'.
Now as
every higher faculty is condi-
tionally.dete'rmi=ned by a
peculiar organ,
we must allow fthat each of these higher
organs is possessed .of its peculiarfaculty of
conception, of judgment,
'
and -of-memory,
and"can consequently admit its own ideas
Bom the external world. Hence we
may
explain what is called the practical tact,
for -fhereare people, who in Lalmost every
thing are
stupid, but who, in_one parti-
cular branch, possessa surprisinglyquick
insight and penetration. We may thence

From _what has hitherto been said we'
may with the: greatest probability sup-
pose; that such' organs as
possess their
peculiar faculty of conception, of judg-
ment, and of memory, have also the ahif
lity, when the vital power within them
is greatly aggregated, of procuring,
in some manner or other (the organs of
sense being closed) a communication _with,
the external world; and thus it naturally
follows, that people in their sleep, if some

V
Here, however, are two questions which
oughtto be answered: First, How does it
happen that such sleep-walkers, in their
sleep,accomplish'things which are
impossi-
ble ton Waking person? For instance, Mr.
Von Horst relates: "
An apprentice"saw
one 'day some swallows hatching their
youngin a
very high' steeple near an open
window in it. He' gets up in his sleep,
goes to the steeple, and findinga high lad-
der used for building, which he couldnever

carries it to the steeple,
~
goes up, and en-
fers the window, although the ladder was
18;<feet'too short, and after being inthe
steeple fqrssome time, he awoke in the
greatest surprise." Many more iuS1'an¢és_
of;th,is kind, are related. Secondly, How
does it happen that such people, when
they are called by their name, instantly
awake, and are
exposed to the danger of
falling?
_
»
a
r
'§ -71'-
'
,
According to Dr, Gall, the _first question
is easily answered. He asserts,.that,tlIere
is an
organ, and particularly the ,ning-
teenth,* in the brain, which he calls the
organ of cirpuinspection. It ishis opinion,
that when., this organ is not in aeti,vity,_
no precaqtpn is used, 'and man becomes
bolder in ,his actions. =He gat the,same

time supposes, that during somnambue
lism this organ is in a state of inactivity.
To this supposition, however, we might
make' the following objections; lirst, that
the want of precaution does not 'take away
the danger, but rather increases lt; and
secondly, that the other question, 'whythe
calling 'by the name accelemtes danger,
is not answered by it.
'
' `
§72.
~
In my opinion, these two questions are
better answered in the following manner:
The danger to which we are exposed in a
waking state, as in cl-imbing,swimming,
and other actions of the like nature, most#
ry depends on the fear which- we entertain
ofdanger; we are seizeé with a trembling;
we thereby lose dm' equilibrium, oriba-
lance, and' hence the danger. For' instance,
if wewoulld walk over" a narrow bridge
without balustrades,~~ofreach side of which
thewatel is very deep," we cannot turn
our eyés»-eitherto the rightfoirllefr without
the risk of falling into the waterg' tbl'
on *ANIMAL xnnwrrsu. Q
the idea of the danger puts us out of
countenance and off our guard, which
makes us. losoaur Fur is solely
the eHiaoi of adispmitionstoz self-préserr
vuhinn. attached ta all Gtredllrea. Plum
this disposition. .to self-preservation we
my suppose a distinct consciousness.
Again, this consciousness cannot take.
place, oreanist, butwhen alle partsnre C0111-'
pletcby' in- a waking state, that is, where,
the- sepamte kinds. oii consciousness of the
separate organs concur, in onler to form as
general consciousness, but which -is not
the case with the somnambulist, because
all his organs are not in a state ofactivity:
It therefore naturally follows, that no
fear does exist in this ease, consequently
those actions which have been related
succeedf better than -in :a-_waking state,
and in case-danger shouldreallyappear,
such somnanlbulists- immediately awake.
Mr. Von Horst relates, thata sleep-walker

touched the water, he oalled= for help;

The 'second question now resolves it-
sel£ The name ofa person includes his
whole self.. By pronouncing,"-or calling
him by' his name, the whole individual,
who, in ifact, is not completely asleep,
necessarily awakes, the intemal and com;
plete consciousness of himself is recalled,
and 'at the same
'
time .the disposition tb
self-preservation again comes into action)
hence it is natural, that, at the sudden
sight of danger, he must be' seized witha
giddiness, lose this balance, and conseé
quently fall.

ACTIVITY OF _ ALL 'THE HIGHER ORGANS
COMBINED WITH THE SUSPENSION OF
TI-IE ORGANS OF SENSE. -
Hitherto we have 'only been speaking
of cases where, in th_e state of sleep, some
of the higher organs only are engaged,
ON ANIMM., MAQNETISM. 95;
and particularly, those'~!which aremostly
employed in a
waking' state. In such
cases the sphere of action ,must naturally
always confine itself to single actions. .
`
But, if a state could ,he eifected or prof
duced, in which the organs of sense would
be folosed, and_ all the higher organs put
into full activity, then the question would
be,, whence proceeds that greatafliux of
vital ,powerfl and the answer would be,
that _either almost, the whole of the vital,
power had left all other parts of the body,
and ,coHected itself in the brain, the seat
of the higher organs, by which means all.
those parts, which it had left or
forsaken,
would fall into a death-like stupor; or,_
that a great afllux of vital power was at-
tracted froni without, s

THE DECREASE OF CAMPAOITY FOR ANIMAL
MAGNETISM BY THE INCREASE OF THE
HEALTHY STaTE."
1
As the body in' "perfectly healthy
state, as before mentioned, has no suscep-
tihility for a
larger quantity ofvital; power,
it is consequently quite' natural' that, such-
persons, immediately
restored, lose their q,na1it_gi_qf
Animal Magnetism, and the efects of it
gnaehlallyoease. ___ _dns
_ `, . , L ,
' '
,
It_.seems the,reason»why, in the
state, tliepe is _no susceptibility _
of
Magnetism, is, that _magnetisnn is _siinilaij
to the power of attragtion ;° namely;
positive _pole of the" _ci°eation':__`_aiii1lflilgt
e'l6Ctricity is similar to the powfel; gf llfeff
pulsion; namely, the negative pole _of
creation, and by_ the conflict of both
these the existence. of_matter is the iesnlt
and the healthy state of man,
cosmos, is thus produced by the coniiiet of
both. e

was obliged to discontinue his operations.
A man, of iifty-four years of age, was
disabled in his upper and lower extremitiesy
occasioned' by debilitas nervorum, which
was probably the consequence of a local
aifection ofthe medullu spinubis. Notwith-
standing the doctor 'was sure, thatthe adhid

other remediés'whi&:h he had hitherto used;

coinply with the wishes of his patient;
After some
manipulations he fell intoa
state of slumbering, alter which he 'felt
better: the pain above the eyes andthe
dimness of the sight, which effects of 'the
diseaseihe had experienced for a
long time,
at length decreased; the appetite, which
was almost lost, was in a few days restored,
and the digestion was
recovered; the usual
evacuations became properly regulated,
and his 'muscular 'powers were so #dr in-
creasfed, that he began towalk. In con-
on ANIMAL mgnnrxsn. IIQ
sequence of this, the patient insisted On
the magnetiser's continuingto operateupon
him ; but the magnetisenbesidesbeingcon-
tident that all operations would in theend be
fruitless, and that the patient would never
be actually restored byit, felt every dayafter
the operations an unusual lassitude, and
certain sensations which he disliked; he
therefore continued to operate with disgust.
The patient being unwilling to relinquish
the application ofAnimal Magnetism, the
magnetiser employed another practitioner,
who had previouslyoifered his services; but
the second magnetiserexperiencedthe same
unpleasant etfects as the former, and he
was obliged to suspend the operations for
some
days, when the disagreeable feelings
ceased : he had, however, scarcely recom-
menced the operations, when the un-
pleasant etfects were
again felt, and 'he
was constrained to desist from operating
in this case. The patient soon returned to
'his former state, and he is at present quite
lame.

Although I intended
'
to remove the
wonders beyond, or not within, the sphere
of nature, we yet must not forget to ad-
mire the Whole universe, or all nature it-

his dramatic poem of Nathan the Wise,
"
The greatest wonder of all wonders is,
that we are indifferent to the daily won-
ders that surround us." I may be allowed

Almighty Power, and

THE phenomena which are observed in mag'-
netised persons are the following:
In the lowest degree :-slight changes of the
feelings ; shivering; in some
persons, augmen-
tation of vital warmth.
A state of ease ; in some, however, uneasiness.
Anguish; compression; general heaviness of
the body, or local oppression; as, heaviness in
the head, or in the limbs. Extension; con-
traction ; yawning, .and stretching of the limbs;
feverish attacks; agitation of the blood; and
often spasmodic attacks, as well as various
kinds sf Pain-
ln some persons, stupor; restlessness; pro-
found sleep, more or less; in others, unquiet
sleep. _
Cgnvulsions of all kinds; as, epilepsy;
spasms in the stomach, or in the chest; very
frequently torpor, which passes over into syn-
cope, and in some persons _into lethargy.
Weariness; debility; fainting.
I
_Num_bne,ss; often too great irritability.
_Depression of the spirits; in some persons,
120 APPENDIX.
eheerfulness, humour, pensiveness; in others,
dullness, frenzy, madness.
7
Augmented secretion; as, augmented per-
spiration, urine, diarrhoea: bleeding from the
nose, lungs, uterus, hemorrhoidal vein ; slime;
salivation ; augmentation of tears by weeping;
augmented secretion from the nose and ears;
éicpectoration, &c. and eruptions ofthe skin.
_
Obs. A great part qf the above phenomena I
have observed 771]/88%
'
These phenomena have frequently been ob-
served togtake place before magnetising, and
having subsided, have been reproduced by mag-
netising: but, for the most part," they are
effeeted by the alteration in the body produced
byirnagnetism.
I
_
All these "circumstances continue in some
persons a short time, in others longer, and it is
often 'the case, that they frequently return with-
out the phenomena of a higher degree presenting
themselves. _ _
I
'
Athigher degree of the influence of magnetism
upon the human body is sleep-walking (som-
naviibulismus).
`
The symptoms of the approach of magnetical
sleep are :_
After a
shorter, or longer treatment, often
immediately after being magnetised once, but

very frequently after 'being magnetised. a
dréd times, a heaviness in the whole body fo1§
lows,,a lassitude of all the limbs, and it becomes
impossible for the individual to keep open his
eyelids any longer, and with deep respiration
and yawning he falls asleep.
~
;This falling to sleep is sometimes quiet,
sometimesyunquiet, and the individuals show
by different motions a
feeling of uneasiness:
They often make quick involuntary motions of
the hands towards the eyes, and after being ,spd-l
denly awoke,they immediately fall to sleep again.
{T_hese_ sleepers are in the beginning only;
busy within themselves; they do not
answer
questions,_ and are not easily awaked. i This
sleep does not, in general, last 'longer thana
quarter of an hour; but now and then itcon-
tinues for several hours. Some sleep very
quietly, andare still in communication with the
exterior world' by' their external senses; they
answer questions, but mostly by gesticulations,
as in this state speaking becomes to them very;
difficult. Very often, when in this state, they
do not speak -again fortwo months after, ,and
then_ only by sjngle, abrupt words. In casesf
where they suddenly open their eyelids, or
only
half open them, the white of the eye is only to
be seen ; but with most ct' them the eyelid are,
122 QPPENDIX.
as_it,wjere,, stuck together. This state approaches
already nearer to that of magnetic somnambu-
lism, or rather to the state of clairvoyahca.
i
In the last approach to the state of magnetieal
clairvoyance, those remarkable
phenomena _pre-
sent themselves which occur
in the
state of
sleep-walking!
`
After falling asleep in this state the functions
of the external senses
become graduallywqaker
and weaker; the eyes are fast shut, andzvery
often the hearing iscompletely lost. _
_,
VQuietnde and cheerfulnes , and _an unusual
,sereneness,fis spread over and depicted on the
countenance. They enter, in anew mode, into
a relation with the external world by entirely
diferent organs, and, in particular, are
depen-
dent on their magnetiser, so that they can
per-
_ceive only by him. They recognise only those
persons who are in the ame
report with him as
themselves. .
'V
<
ln 'this shutting up of the external senses, the
internalsense receives with uncommon clear-
,ness the influence of subjects by unusual parts,
and particularly by the region of the stomach,

It very often happens that they become very
oheerihl in this state; they rise from their seat,
*walk* about the room, and, notwithstanding
'theireyes are closed, they avoid all objects
which are i_n their way. They become particu-
flariy oheerthl uif -they are seated under trees, or
.if they 'aresurrouuded with plants.* It is very
remarkable that they perceive the presence`of
,persons more distinctly than any lifeless objects,
even at a distance, and particularly those per-
sons who are in a magnetical conjunction with
-them; they even anticipate the arrival of their
mmsoattime. In some cases they assert that

'lthow'all this? they pretend that they know it by sight;
but if questioned more
closely, they say it is an inward
,fQeli,ug; if &miuedstill more minutely, they say they know
by a soft whispering, as it were,°ot' au occult genius : and
if the, exaniiuer, not satisfied with this, wishes to know more
accurately, they answer that they know it, and that it is
sufiicient that they kuowiit, and they do not wish to be fur~»
tlld qlestioned about it, for that they themselves know not
whether they are in darkness or in the light. This i have

to .be disclosed to it. _,This high state is very
seldom observed ; and I agree ,completely with
those who are of opinion, that if such state be
possible, only pure, and, in the highest sense,
moral subjects, are ,able to reach such heights.
The body, in this state, is, as it were, com-
pletely numbed ; the eyelids are
opened, but only
the white. of the eye is to be seen; the
speech is
very soft and smooth, and hardly perceptible ;
the countenance isltransformed, and exhibits, as
itjwere, ,a
picture of innocence. 'l`he utterance
of these individuals, and particularly theirifer-
vent prayers to their Creator, agitates every per-
son present. They are now very little occupied
with the circumstances, of their own bodies, but
rather with distant events; for instance, they,
perceive that their near relations are sick, or
dying, or are already dead, and this with the ut-
most exactness, as it regards the accompanying
circumstances, notwithstanding they may be a
thousand miles distant from them, and predict
exactly how and when the report of these events
will the brought. Some of them occupy them-
selves particularly with contemplations of nature;
for instance, a female who was never in Ame-
rica, and who never _read ggugraphical descrip-
tions, in this. high .degree.of clairvayanca, de-
scribed America very accurately, the character of

its inhabitants, their manner of
living, and all
particulars of that part ofthe world; she also
_accurately described Africa, Asia, and Germany,
There are cases in which the contemplations
of these persons have not been confined merely
to our earth, but even extended to the planets,
'and they have described their nature. But it
appears that these contemplations are confined
to our planetary system."
It' isvery remarkable that the human mind,
which, in this state, as well 'as 'in the lower
degrees of Animal Magnetism, manifests itself
as wholly unfettered, and divested of all gross
objects, seems, in this its original, -noble, pure,
and highest moral nature, to suffer asit were
the torments of hell by the slightest impure
thought of those who may' be in any magnetical
connexion with it; and they express this
without reserve, adding, that such persons, if
they would spare them the pain of violent spasms,
must relinquish their impure ideas, or leave
the room.1'

I was never so fortunate as to observe the phenomena of
this high degree of Animal Magnetism.
`
1' I was myself present when. a magnetised person said to
Mr. S., the magnetiser, "
No, doctor; you have unclean
ideas; I beg you will leave them, you give me much pain."

Obs. 'If itebe true, that there is no

then all riddles concerning this remote and ez:-
tended working and seeing, in magnetical life,
will be immedidtely unravelled.
