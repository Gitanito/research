  					 I WAS TOLD AFTERWARDS THAT I WAS DYING AND MY SONS WERE CALLED TO MY BEDSIDE.


I WAS IN A COMA. IN THE EXPERIENCE, I WAS TRANSPORTED VERY FAST THROUGH A TUNNEL. SO MUCH SO THAT I COULD FEEL THE SENSATION OF BEING PULLED THROUGH ON MY ARMS AND LEGS.


AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL THERE WERE BRIGHT OVERHEAD LIGHTS. I WENT THROUGH THE LIGHT, AND WAS IN A RED BRICK ROOM (WALLS AND FLOOR). IT WAS VERY COLD AND MY FEET WERE FREEZING.


I WAS IN FRONT OF JESUS CHRIST AND BEHIND HIM WERE MY DECEASED FATHER AND PATERNAL GRANDMOTHER IN THE CLOTHES WE BURIED THEM IN. IT WAS LIKE AN EL GRECO PAINTING. EVERYONE WAS VERY SOMBER AND SERIOUS. CHRIST ASKED ME IF I WAS READY TO DIE AND I RESPONDED, ‘YES’. HE SAID YOU HAVE TO GO BACK BECAUSE OF YOUR SON CHRISTOPHER (AGE 20 AT THE TIME AND LIVING WITH ME). MY GRANDMOTHER WAS PRAYING THE ROSARY IN ITALIAN IN A LOW VOICE. MY FATHER NEVER SAID A WORD AND LOOKED VERY SAD AND SERIOUS. I TOLD CHRIST HE HAS A BROTHER AND SISTER-IN-LAW, AND JESUS JUST SHOOK HIS HEAD NO.


WITH THAT I WAS RETURNED TO THE TUNNEL, PULLED THROUGH BACK AND WOKE UP IN MY HOSPITAL BED.


WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS, I IMPROVED VASTLY AND LEFT THE HOSPITAL IN A FEW DAYS MUCH TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF MY SONS.
