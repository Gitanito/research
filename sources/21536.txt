PREFACE
A preface can never be more than a final sigh in which
remorse mingles with relief. Because of my supreme
intent to pass in brief and striking review the whole
pageant of religious oddity in America, it has been neces
sary to subordinate each part somewhat to the scheme
of the whole, with the result that some of my chapters
will seem all too brief. But it should be borne constantly
in mind that this is a descriptive book on the religious
scene and not a theological tract. The material has been
so radiant and amusing that to present it attractively
has at all times been my chief concern. Clearly I have
been beguiled by the odd, but not, I hope, to the point
of inaccuracy. For the benefit of those with an appetite
for raw facts I have appended "A Brief Dictionary of
Sects." m
Especial thanks are due Jackson V. Griswold for inval
uable aid in research and to William A. Weekes, now of
the Associated Press, Detroit, for his diligence in finding
material on the House of David.

I
THE MODERN BABEL
IT should be obvious to any man who is not one him
self that the land is overrun with messiahs. I refer not
to those political quacks who promise in one election to
rid the land of evil, but rather to those inspired fakirs
who promise to reduce the diaphragm or orient the soul
through the machinery of occult religion. Each of these
has seriously made himself the centre of a new theophany,
has surrounded himself with a band of zealous apostles,
has hired a hall for a shrine, and has set about busily to
rescue Truth from the scaffold and put it on the throne.
The average man knows nothing of these new messiahs,
unless perchance he reads that Swami Yogananda has
been ridden out of Florida or hears of the plans of Aimee
Semple McPherson for the Foursquare Gospel Mission,
or unless his wife is a Theosophist, his emancipated
daughter a member of the Liberal Catholic Church, his
aunt a devotee of the School of Silent Unity, and his son
a Buchmanite, or unless he receives gratis the literature
of the Rosicrucian Fellowship. If, however, he will take
the Saturday edition of any metropolitan daily and scan
the page devoted to the announcement of religious serv
ices, the extent and intensity of these quixotic cults will
be clear to him. In the New York Sun for November
20, 1927, announcements were made of over one hun
dred and forty religious services for the one borough of
Manhattan. Of these, fully half had to do with cults and
sects of cults bearing no relation to any form of orthodox
Christianity. The same ratio obtains for the announce
ments carried in the March 17, 1928, issue of that paper,

in which appeared 182 cards, of which 90 had to do with
the cults. Furthermore, the regular churches carry an
nouncements of Sunday services only> whereas most of
the cults have from three to five services Weekly.
Here is Transcendent Science proclaiming itself aS the
World's Greatest Thought Discovery: "Teaches you
how to solve any problem over night. Results practically
guaranteed. Instantaneous demonstrations possible." Then
there is Fidelia M. Lewis, answering, in one of the
(Ranashad lectures, the vital question of all religions,
Why do we suffer? At the United Lodge of Theosophists
the subject is Fate and Free Will: "Can a man control
his own destiny? How can he develop the will? What is
the will of the soul?" In the Waldorf-Astoria ball room,
the congregation of the First Church of Divine Science
is to hear "How to be Happy," and Mary Chapin, au
thor of The Way Out is to speak at the Hotel Com
modore on some new aspect of the New Thought; while
the First Spiritualist Church announces its services at
the Carnegie Hall and its subject as "The Intellectual
Life of a Spirit."
At the Actors' Church, Dr. St. Louis Estes, President
of the American Raw Food and Health Association, re
veals his Startling New Discovery on Brain Breathing,
"so that you may now LIVE 150 YEARS!" Luella F.
Phelan, Ps.D., "Mender of Human Pottery," offers a
"scientific analysis and constructive solution of existing
conditions." The Church of Christ Teachings, Incor
porated, will meet at the Hotel McAlpin and at the
Steinway Hall, Dr. Charles Francis Taylor will lecture
on "God, Etiquette, and Fun." At the Beecher Memorial
School of Spiritual Science, an interesting discussion of
"Synthetic Truth" is promised. And there is Super
Akashi Yogi Wassan, who has the doubtful honour of
having interested the unhappy Governor Johnston of
Oklahoma in the oriental mysteries. As though all the rest
of human anatomy had been used up, Yogi Wassan makes
his oracle the solar plexus and offers in one lecture on
Sunday evening to provide the key to that mystic region,
and to solve in ten lectures all problems relating thereto

—which, by the way, comprise all the problems of life,
economic as well as spiritual.
Nor is New York alone in its devotion to the mysteries.
In his admirable book, Modern Religious Cults and
Movements, Gaius Glenn Atkins lists activities in De
troit which make those in New York seem like the old
time religion. There The Ultimate Thought Society
holds forth ; there too is the Culture of Isolan, the Spirit
Temple of Light and Truth, The Philosophical Church
of Natural Law, and the Church of Psychic Research.
The subjects announced for a single Sunday include the
following: "The Opulent Consciousness," "The Spirit
ualism of Shakespeare," "The Voiceless Code of the
Cosmos," "The Godlikeness of Divine Metaphysics in
Business," —and all of these, of course, are over and be
yond the standard sects and heterodoxies—such as
Christian Science, Russellism, Mormonism, and Sweden-
borgianism —which the average American has come to
regard as queer.
Any page of religious announcements will suffice to
show the epidemic of curious belief, though we must of
course except the winter months in the East, for it is then
that the swamis and yogis leave their haunts in Gotham
and go to Florida, or to the Middle West, where they
give courses in astrology to devout governors or prey upon
fat ladies in the dimly lighted shrines of opulent hotels.
In the fall and spring, however, they are rampant in the
cities, where their number and their claims are matters
open to the observation of anyone who will take the pains.
It should be a matter of common observation that this
clamour of voices represents the really vigorous wing of
American religious life. Here is religion in action, and
religion actively in the making. The student of religious
phenomena is provided by this whole spectacle with the
best possible chance to observe and record the many
phases of religious behaviour. Hardly a day passes which
does not bring news of some new religious faith. Not long
ago a young girl in New England fell into a trance and
told her parents —as Swedenborg, Ann Lee, Annie Be-
sant, and others before her—that she could communicate

with the world of spirits. She lay in a state of coma for
days ; her father said she was an angel, the doctor said she
was an epileptic. But before the second day had passed,
according to accounts carried in the New York World,
there was a constant queue of neighbours in pilgrimage
to her door. She had become the intermediary between
two worlds, her bed was transformed into a shnne, be
reaved members of the community were her devotees,
and her father was the keeper of the sacred mystc ies. In
brief, we have here all the machinery of a new cult;
whether it will materialize into a world religion remains
to be seen, but we must remember that equally common
place and lowly circumstances gave rise to modern Spirit
ualism, which has enlisted the devotion of some of the
more sapient members of the present generation.
II
America, of course, has always been the sanctuary of
amazing cults. Indeed, it was settled by outlawed re
ligions, most of which later became orthodoxies. As early
as 1653 five families of Mennonites settled among the
Quakers on Gravesend Bay, and hard upon their heels
came other stepchildren of the Reformation. Some of
these cults have yielded to the temptations of modern life,
but the customs and habits of the Mennonites had not
until recently changed one whit since the day they finally
established themselves at what is now Germantown,
Pennsylvania.
Ever since the day Mother Ann Lee and her woe
begone troupe of Shakers stepped off a leaky tub onto
the welcome soil of Manhattan, the immigration has been
immense. The Shakers stemmed from a band of roving
prophets in England and France, and they found a cor
dial welcome among the converts of a New York revival
who felt that Methodism had already begun to get too
worldly. Then during the Nineteenth Century came the
Amish Mennonites —a solid, uncompromising body of
folk who to this day refuse to take up such fast practices
as wearing buttons and suspenders or riding in top bug

gies. And in the closing years of the century came the
most curious of all—the Dukhobor, sponsored in their
pilgrimage by none less than Count Leo Tolstoy. They
settled on the plains of Canada, where they fell into
sharp disputes with a government which asked them to
register births and marriages. As a result of their dis
content and their messianic faith, a monstrous delegation
of these people in the early years of this century sallied
forth naked to meet Jesus in the Canadian Northwest.
And if religious cults have sought us as a sanctuary, we
have ourselves made the most of our religious freedom.
During the Nineteenth Century we gave three great re
ligions to the world: Spiritualism, Mormonism and
Christian Science. Not only so, but it was in that fruit
ful period that the Millerite revival swept the Middle
West and prosperous farmers sold all their lands, in
vested in ascension robes, and led by an ignorant soldier
of the War of 181 2, went out to await the final resurrec
tion of Jesus. New Thought, fathered by the gentle
Phineas P. Quimby, lay in its swaddling clothes and had
only to await the growth of active dissension in the Chris
tian Science ranks before it rose, girded its loins, and
stood forth as one of our most virile religious sons. Swe-
denborgianism, with its policy of intercommunion be
tween the world of flesh and the world of spirit, came
early to these shores and provided a fertile psychological
field for the growth of the New Thought and of Spirit
ualism. One of the first advocates of the New Thought
was to be found in the person of Warren Felt Evans, a
Swedenborgian minister of New Hampshire.
Long before Mother Eddy ever visited Phineas P.
Quimby and wrote ecstatic letters about his healing pow
ers to the papers of Maine, we were treated to a rage of
mesmerism. And in its wake came Spiritualism, started
on its world-encircling march by gentle rappings in a
lowly cottage at Hydesville, New York, where dwelt a
humble farmer named Fox and his simple wife and two
daughters. And while Mother Eddy retired from the
public view and directed her gigantic organization from
the seclusion of her New Hampshire home, the first

apostle of Baha'u'llah came to Chicago, where ladies re
ceived him warmly, and the new faith of Bahaism be
came established on these shores. And while Dwight L.
Moody lashed the multitude with earnest pleas for re
pentance, another shoe-clerk —this one a resident of
Pittsburgh—began to establish a faith which was des
tined to involve its founder in endless litigation and rouse
the clergymen of America to a new and frightful menace
—that of Russellism. The same year that Mrs. Eddy
published the first edition of Science and Health in New
England, that amazing woman, Helena P. Blavatsky,
founded the first Theosophical society in New York.
The same year that Mrs. Annie Besant discovered Jiddu
Krishnamurti at Adyar, India, the Rosicrucian Fellow
ship was established in California; and Pastor Russell
was hardly cold in his grave when the Liberal Catholic
Church was established in England, and Bishop Irving
Steiger Cooper appointed regionary Bishop of North
America.
Today our religious history repeats itself with a ven
geance. Beyond doubt the recrudescence of religion since
the war has expressed itself chiefly in the gain of the isms,
and in their multiplication. The numerical growth of the
orthodox has been negligible. Over eleven thousand
churches among Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists
are reported by the Men's Church League to have gone
without a single convert during 1927. Everywhere the
ministers of the standard churches express pain and dis
may over the hegira from the churches to the cults,
though, unfortunately, the pain does not stop it. We wit
ness today the flourishing of more than two score of
bouncing, active isms, wealthy in finance, seductive in
psychology, and incessantly active in propaganda. This
estimate takes no account of literally hundreds of smaller
cults which have sprung from the older ones and centred
about this teacher or that idea. As soon as a cult becomes
old enough, it gives birth to a brood of sects, or rather
let us say that the population increases by a process of
cellular division. Hardly an orthodox body exists in
America today without a digit of sects which have

"broken away in protest against worldliness or in pursuit
of the illusion of progress. Only in recent months the
Liberal Christian Scientists have organized, and New
Thought has a subdivision for every flatulent term in
the English language, passing variously under the names
of Divine Science, Unity, Ultimate Thought, and the
like. It is to the cults that we must look if we are to find
the lauded revival of religion which so many hopeful
saints have prophesied.
The truth
is,
of course, that the land
is
simply teeming
with faith—that marked credulity that accompanies pe
riods of great religious awakening and seems to be with
us
a
permanent state of mind. By no stretch of the vocab
ulary could our age be called an age of doubt;
it
is
rather an age of incredible faith, and
I
believe even
a
casual study of the Liberal Catholics, the Russellites, the
Theosophists, the New Thoughters, or any of the rest,
will bring this fact into relief. The student of either so
ciety or religion could do no better than to junk his
texts for
a
year and read sedulously the literature of odd
religions; he will gain at first hand an experimental
knowledge of human behaviour that can never be ac-
iquired by the most painstaking research into the practices
of primitive people. And in the cults—active, malignant,
naive, aggressive, and propagandistic enough to say
frankly what they believe and practise—he will find more
raw stuff than he could find in years of patient study in
anthropology. It
is
the difference between abstract psy
chology and behaviourism.
Indeed
it
strikes me as passing curious that the modern
religious scene in its richest colours has been ignored.
Even those who write popular treatises on religion per

their materials. They have much to say of Astarte and
Gautama and Lao-tsze, but they miss entirely such mod

They have much to say of Isis and nothing to say of

vine Science, more of religious origins than they do of
religion's present curiosities. Of strange practice and in
credible belief among out-of-the-way cults, the average
American knows less than nothing. Yet certainly the Ba-
hais, the Swedenborgians, the Mormons, the Spiritualists,
the Shakers, and the Buchmanites yield a lore as rich as
anything Frazer treats of in The Golden Bough. The
celestial hierarchy of Theosophy is as good as Greek my
thology, and no review of "this believing world" is half
complete without the story of Christian Science and of
Ku Kluxism.
Nor indeed is any picture of the American scene com
plete until our isms have been sketched into it. The cults,
as everyone knows, symbolize the way we amuse our
selves religiously. The orthodox churches are inadequate
for our faith and our boundless passions. Yet the cults
remain obscure in literature and art. Our business ac
tivities are familiar to all. Our auction bridge has itself
evolved a literature as extensive as that of golf. That
politics has become a sad and rather sickening jumble of
idiocies we have been told plenty of times. Our amuse
ments and our morals have been aired until they are al
most purified. But business, pleasure and politics do not
make the whole of America. It is astonishing that the
whole flamboyant religious scene has been left out of the
catalogue of our day, for in no particular are we more
egregious and incredible than in our religious capers.
To be sure, Fundamentalism and the antics of our
evangelists and reformers have not passed unnoticed. But
Straton and Sunday and Clarence True Wilson are not
our national religious heroes. In the back places they
may be esteemed among the orthodox and the pathetic,
but only because they have happened upon the scene and
made religion fluent for a moment. It is in the babble of
isms that religious life best expresses itself, for here
the people have expressed their discontent with standard
forms of religion and taken the reins in their own hands.
In short, the isms represent democracy and its disinte
grating influences at work in the orthodox religion of our
day. Here we find the true temper of the people, for their

allegiance has been given voluntarily. We find the genu
inely religious type of mind, not in the orthodox
churches, but rather in the cults ; the willingness to break
with home and old alignments signalizes the true faith
in the spiritual mirage. The cults stand for creative re
ligion in the hands of the people. We shall not know
America until we know the religions that America has
made and embraced.
ill
What accounts for all this luxuriance of oddity in re
ligion? The answer, it seems to me, is simple. For one
thing the cults offer to do something that the regular
churches make no pretence of doing, and they offer to do
what they do painlessly and quickly. They will solve any
problem over night, and the results are practically guar
anteed. They promise to provide, often in ten lectures,
something that the average church long ago gave up hope
of providing. .They have addressed themselves to the ac
tual, and not to the imaginary problems and desires of
the American public. The New Thought, with its con
stant thought of prosperity, its opulent-consciousness, its
belief in the limitless possibilities of the individual, is
simply American psychology on dress parade. No re
ligion is big enough to hold the aspirations of the New
Thought. Its hopes exceed those of any orthodox belief;
the result is that it breaks with tradition and stands upon
its own adequate bottom.
Or there are the healing cults, numbering among them
not only Christian Science and the therapeutic branches
of the New Thought, but many of the innumerable
swamis and vegetarians and other money-changers in the
temple. The whole movement which they represent has
simply been a restoration of the business of healing to the
machinery of religion. Mesmer, with his mysterious tac
tics in curing disease, took the business of healing from
the Church. Mother Eddy restored
it,
just as John Roach
Straton has tried of late to do himself. We are

10 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
it is little wonder that we have turned to contemplation
and mystic mental breathing for relief. In the rush of
our own mechanical life we have forgotten the slow and
easy methods and the highblown and polysyllabic wis
dom of the East. The result here has been a rediscovery
of the oriental method of living —a distinct anodyne for
our misery, and we have welcomed the Eastern teachers
who would teach us quietude and periodic heavenly rest.
We have become dissatisfied, too, with what might
roughly be called our materialism —the thing for which
foreigners are forever lecturing us. We have seen that
mechanical inventions do not make a world and that less
advanced people have much to offer. This is a perfectly
natural and admirable conclusion, the product of self-
analysis and broad-mindedness. It is particularly the con
clusion of youth coming of age. Thus have we grown
receptive to the lore and mysteries of the East as ex
pressed in Hinduism and popularized by the fakirs who
have come to teach us. Theosophy and kindred cults are
but Americanized forms of the oriental mysteries, de
signed for occidental consumption.
But by far the most conspicuous trait of the modern
cults is their friendship, nay, amiability with science, the
archfiend of most evangelical bodies. We Americans are
on a quest; we are trying to synthesize science and re
ligion and brew nectar from the synthesis. The Modern
istic movement is of course a timid step in the right direc
tion, but it has failed lamentably to make the grade.
There lingers in the mind of most Modernists the sly sus
picion that, after all, scientific knowledge and religious
belief are irreconcilable, and this honest uncertainty has
prepared the field for some more positive assertion of
the boon friendship of religion and science.
This assertion is abundantly provided by the cults. The
whole of Christendom is exercised over the warfare be
tween science and theology. On one hand are the Funda
mentalists with their strident cat-calls and jeers, their
contempt for scientific inquiry and their belief in the
adequacy of religion to meet every need of man. On the
other side stand the Modernists, asserting persuasively

but not too convincingly that there is no conflict between
true science and true religion. And in between the two
are the bulk of the cults, content and superior, for they
have said, have they not? that there is no conflict, and
they have proved it. I mean to say that Christian Science
has gained much of its reputation by the sheer weight
of its name. It merges in a single term two concepts which
are generally held to be antithetical. The New Thought
is on the best of terms with what it chooses to call science,
and Theosophy is bedfellow to science "rightly under
stood." There may be as much temporizing on the part
of all these cults as there is among the evangelicals, but
the position taken serves a better purpose. As long as
any body can convince its believers in this day that its
faith embraces both religion and science, that faith has
a following. And, what is more, it has a feeling of supe
riority. The Liberal Catholic Church, for example, wel
comes science, claims to have no creed and no dogma, and
to blend science and religion in one perfect picture of
Divine Life.
All the while these cults are, of course, speaking of a
different science from the harsh physical science that has
made so great an impact upon Western civilization. But
what of it? Science today is a term, and nothing more,
when it is used in connexion with religion by religion
ists. And it is simply because the cults have solved to
their own satisfaction the whole problem of religion and
science by means of renaming science that they have won
such friendship among the distraught of the earth.
Not all the cults, I grant, express our dissatisfaction
with modern contrivances or our desire to escape the
thought that science undermines religious faith. Some
of these are reactionary. Just as the Mennonites and the
Anabaptists sprang into being through the conviction that
the Reformation had not been thorough enough, so some
of the cults today are protests against the worldliness of
organized religion. The Mennonites, still existent and
still intractable, are a sample. The Russellites, with their
solid convictions based upon the words of Holy Writ

league with the devil, are the most notable example
among our contemporaries. I should say that Buchman-
ism logically falls in this class, for it is stridently evangel
ical in its tone and hell-bent upon the salvation of souls. It
has, however, another feature to mark it for distinction ;
and that is its resounding emphasis upon sex. It has fed, I
believe, upon the modern discovery of sex. It is in re
ligion what True Stories and True Marriage Confes
sions are in the magazine field. It has points in common
—its confessional, for example—with Shakerism, and
there is nothing new about
it,
save its astonishing appeal
to the college men of England and America. The Four
square Gospel Mission of Aimee Semple McPherson
is
of course positively reactionary, as was the wave of Ku
Kluxism that swept America following the war. It was
not by accident, as
I
shall have occasion later to show,
that the Klan and the Church were chums. The Klan was,
whatever else may be said of
it,
essentially
a
religious or
ganization.
Spiritualism stands, psychologically, alone, though its
progress springs largely from reaction. The voice of the
Church on immortality has grown either thin and rasp
ing with threats of hell, or soft, persuasive, and unau-
thoritative with its tender promises and its doubtful as
surances that we live in
a
reasonable universe. But here
is
Spiritualism proclaiming, and to all practical appear
ances, demonstrating, the indestructibility of personal
ity. Is
it
any wonder that Spiritualism has spread like
wildfire, leaping oceans and kindling faith in every land?
It may be taken as
a
truism that
a
religion
is
virile in
proportion to the hope
it
offers of either longevity or an
other chance in the world to come. Spiritualism deals
with the one cosmic question that concerns craven man
most vitally, and
it
answers that question with bells and
ectoplasm and fireworks.

fo America's newest faith —Atheism. I am always sur
prised when I do not find the announcement of the serv
ices of the Ingersoll Open Forum among the religious
notices carried each week in the New York dailies. I am
serious and I have the documents when I say that there
is no more evangelical cult in modern times than the
American Association for the Advancement of Atheism\
Nothing so admirably demonstrates the fact that the
greater part of man's social and individual behaviour is
religious than the antics and literature of this group. On
January i, 1927, it sent its first foreign missionary abroad.
It announces as its slogan "Kill the Beast!" It challenges
a priest-ridden American to throw off its shackles, and
appeals to the world at large to "join the army for the
liberation of humanity." It has its Five Fundamentals
and its Social Program. It looks to the establishment
on this continent of what is to all intents and purposes a
Kingdom of God, and the palingenesis that it proposes
to accomplish is every whit as thorough as that of Mor-
monism or Russellism. It has its evangelists and its per
sonal workers. It derives its motive power from the de
nial of a popular belief, and from the martyrdom that it
encourages. Philosophically, it is religious, for it makes
a huge religious ceremony of denying God. Practically,
it is religious, for it is nothing but a lurid imitation of
early Methodism in its tactics and its capers.
In the early part of 1903 the Bahais of Chicago, having
secured the permission of Abdul Baha, as successor to
Baha'u'llah, planted on the shores of Lake Michigan the
haunches of what they intended to be a monument to the
oneness of all religions. It was, I take
it,
to be an answer
to the Tower of Babel. Unfortunately, or, shall we say,
appropriately, the monument has never been completed.
.The work has lagged, and internal difficulties among the
Bahais have necessitated the curtailment of the original
plans. Obviously the time

not yet ripe for the temple
of Mashriqu'l-Adhkar to be erected. The language of the

the by-product of it all is distress to the orthodox. But

II
SPIRITUALISM
THAT the religion of a modern English scientist should
find its origin and excuse in the performance of two
country girls at Hydesville, New York, in 1848 seems in
credible. The birthplace of Spiritualism is inadequate,
even if Christianity did arise from a manger, and the
student is tempted to look in other directions for its
origins. But to no avail. Spiritualism, as we know it to
day, began with the mysterious rappings of Kate and
Margaret Fox. The allegiance of Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle and Sir Oliver Lodge, the interest of Sir Gilbert
Murray and the hankering of Havelock Ellis of our own
day, to say nothing of the interest Elizabeth Barrett
Browning and others of an earlier day, all derive from
what took place in the humble cottage at Hydesville—
now converted, of course, into a shrine to which Ameri
can Spiritualists make pilgrimages every year. The little
Fox sisters made the raps that were heard round the
world.
The fact is not without significance. "Happily for the
momentous work which the spiritual telegraphers had
undertaken to initiate in this humble dwelling," says M.
E. Cadwallader, "the first manifestations did not appear
to the high and learned of the earth, but to the plain com
mon sense of an honest farmer's wife. . . ." And thus
"the low muffled sounds of the spirit-raps that first broke
the slumber of the peaceful inhabitants of that humble
tenement at Hydesville became the clarion peal that
sounded out to millions in the Western Hemisphere the

anthem of the soul's immortality, chorused by hosts of
God's bright ministering angels."
l
James G. Underhill has immortalized the "The
Chosen Ones" in verse :
Not to men of worldly wisdom
Did the light from heaven come,
But to playful little children
In their humble Hydesville home;
Not by men of highest learning,
Men of deepest thought profound,
But by guileless little children
Was the light from heaven found.
'Neath the kindly supervision
Of the dwellers of the skies
Little children builded wiser
Than the "wisdom of the wise."
And the earth is brighter, richer,
Fairer is the world today,
And the angel world is nearer,
Since the children found the way.
[While the "wise ones" scoffed, derided,
And declared it could not be,
Little children in their own way,
Solved the wondrous mystery;
Asking child-like, simple queries,
Half in play, unmixed with fear,
The unseen one answered questions,
Proving "it" could surely hear.
Started thus a world-vibration
With no power to intervene;
Spread the tidings through each nation
And the spirit world unseen —
Led by wisdom of the angels —
Wondrous story to relate—
Thus the playful little children
Opened wide the heavenly gate.
Love and honour to the children
Who let light upon the world ;

SPIRITUALISM 17
Be their names remembered ever
Where our banner is unfurled ;
Let their frailties, which were human,
Be forgotten in our love,
And our gladness for the tidings 2
They delivered from above.
The story of early American Spiritualism can hardly
be more than an exposition of this devout eulogy. We
should note, however, that the rappings at Hydesville
and later at Rochester were by no means the first hints
that ever came from the world of spirits. Swedenborg
had free and easy intercourse with the dwellers in the
skies as early as the latter part of the Eighteenth Century,
and the Church of the New Jerusalem which he founded
was not without importance in membership and influence
when the craze of Spiritualism first became rampant.
While it is true that the work of the Swedish seer had to
do chiefly with angels, or non-human spirits, Hyslop in
his Contact -with the Other World asserts that "modern
spiritualism really originated with the work of Sweden
borg." Spiritualist belief is of course as old as humanity,
and no ecclesiastical authority had ever dared to con
demn it. The belief in ghosts, while not sedulously cul
tivated by the holy men, had thriven for ages. There
simply had been no purposive cultivation of intercourse
with the world of disembodied human beings through
the instrumentality of "mediums" until the feats of the
guileless little girls of Hydesville started the fad.
Still, there had even been wonder workers before the
Fox sisters. In 1846 there was in France a peasant girl,
Angelique Cottin by name, who at the early age of thir
teen had miraculous powers. These were ascribed, in the
fashion of the day, to the possession of a potent electric
fluid in her body. She was supposed, by those who knew
nothing of electricity, to be charged with this liquid
electricity, and her marvels even escaped detection for
a long while in Paris. She could turn over tables and
chairs simply by coming into a room, and her wonders

were such that even the Paris Academy of Science could
not determine how she did her miracles. She was known
all over Europe as the "electric girl," but in the end it
was discovered that she had simply developed a remark
able power in the muscles of her legs and could throw
over a heavy table with them, under the eyes of observers,
without being detected. In France, too, were the Som-
nambules—ladies thrown into a mesmeric trance that
gave them power to perform such feats of cunning as
utterly bamboozled the sage observers of the day.
In our own native land there was the case of a certain
Dr. Larkin of Wrentham, Massachusetts and his little
Mary Jane. They startled the populace of New Eng
land for several years with feats not unlike those later
performed by mediums, but ultimately their method was
detected and they landed in the hoosegow. Most notable
of all is Andrew Jackson Davis, who has been called by
modern writers "the John the Baptist of Spiritualism."
He was a shoemaker who became in 1843 a mesmeric
healer and clairvoyant. He was at that time a precocious,
long-haired, uncanny youth of seventeen, "the kind of
person," says Joseph McCabe, "who was easily believed
to be rich in animal magnetism." In 1844 he declared
that Swedenborg and Galen had appeared to him in a
trance and laid upon his heart a great mission to man
kind. Subsequently he poured out many effusions and two
men who were transformed by his pyschic power took
him to New York to inaugurate a new revelation. The
three of them lived for a year on the pittances derived
from his healing. His labours in the city left him some
spare time and he employed it by going into trances and
reeling off a completely new philosophy of the universe.
[This was taken down as he received it hot from heaven,
and in 1847 it appeared under the title, The Principles
of Nature. With the hurrah that was loosed by the Fox
sisters, he was silenced, and he devoted the remaining
years of his life to the pleasures of lecturing for the new
cause—the new revelation to which fate had beaten him.
The experiences of the Shakers I have given in the chap
ter devoted to that sect.

n
And now we musr return, with proper humility, to
the little cottage in Hydesville. Here lived the simple
farmer and his wife and the two children, Kate and Mar
garet. At the time the message "that was to emancipate
the world from the fear of death," flashed over the land,
these girls were six and a half and eight years of age.
The house occupied by the honest John Fox and his wife
was regarded by the community as a haunted house. The
story goes, though I am not sure how much of it has been
pieced together since the tradition of the Fox girls be
came sacred matter, that the family which moved out
before the Fox family came in had suffered from the mis
chief of the spirits. The father of this family, a Mr.
Weekman, reported many eerie knockings on his cham
ber door. These were particularly weird because he could
find no one who wanted to come in, though the importu
nate knockings were often kept up a greater part of the
night. Their child, who awoke screaming one night, told
her father that she had felt a hand pass over her face, and
that the hand was cold. These simple folk, it is asserted,
were disturbed by frightful occurrences up to the very
time when the Fox family moved into the house in 1847,
Another family, too, had experienced similar intelli
gence of the spirit world. It is reported that a Mr. and
Mrs. Bell, who preceded the Weekmans, had employed a
girl named Lucretia Pulver. One day a pedlar called
upon Mrs. Bell, and after some conversation with the
man the good lady decided that Lucretia should be sent
home and that her services were no longer needed. She
went, somewhat mollified by Mrs. Bell's promise to have
the pedlar bring her the next day a bright piece of cloth
which the girl had selected from his wares. The pedlar
never came. Not only so, Lucretia was invited back
within a few days and shortly thereafter was left alone
in the house at night. She heard that night the steps of a
man slowly and somewhat petulantly traversing the house
and occasionally making weird noises in the cellar and
in the buttery. The next day she was sent to the cellar on

an errand and there she sank into a hole which had been
only partly filled in with soft dirt. She asked Mrs. Bell
about this hole and Mrs. Bell explained that it was prob
ably the work of rats.
Then came the Weekmans and then came the Foxes.
iThey began at once to have precisely the same experi
ences as their predecessors. During the first part of 1848
these noises, says Mr. Cadwallader, "began to assume
the character of slight knockings heard at night in the
bedroom." Sometimes they sounded as though they came
from the cellar beneath. At first Mrs. Fox tried to per
suade herself that these sounds must come from a shoe
maker working late in a house near by. But this would
not explain
it,
for the family soon noted that these knock
ings, even when not very loud, "often caused
a
tremulous
motion of the beds and chairs—sometimes of the floors."-
After
a
time the noises seemed to become like footfalls
in the various rooms.
In the month of February, 1848, the noises became so
distinct and frequent that their rest was broken night
after night. Father Fox would think he heard
a
rap on
the front door; he would swing
it
open as suddenly as he
could, but no one would be there. Then the pranks of the
spirit—for such
it
turned out to be—became more than
those of mere noise-making. "Once something heavy, as
if
a
big dog, seemed to lie on the feet of the children; but
it
was gone before the mother could come to their aid."
Another time Kate felt as
if
a
cold hand had been laid on
her face. Occasionally the bed clothes were pulled from
their places in
a
most irritating manner and chairs were
moved from their moorings in the dead of night. And
during this harrowing period the noises increased in both
frequency and variety. Often the two adults would light
a
candle and search fearfully into every nook and cranny
of their cottage, but to no avail. There was nothing hu
man about it.
This brings us to March 31, 1848, "a date which was
destined to be indelibly imprinted on the minds of the
coming generations as the daybreak of
a
new era in the
spiritual development of humanity,

since been regularly observed as marking the advent of
the greatest spiritual revelation of modern times, and rec
ognized as the birth of the Spiritualist movement in all
parts of the world." 8
That night the Foxes mistakenly
supposed that they would not be molested. They were
weary of the annoyance and almost dead for the lack of
sleep. They retired early, but scarcely had the children
been tucked in when they cried out, "Here they are
again." The mother chided them, says Mr. Cadwallader
(and it must be noted that I am giving, not a derisive
account of the phenomena, but one drawn from the spirit
ualists' own sources), and the rappings grew more in
sistent than they had ever been before. The children kept
up a continuous chatter. The father tested the windows
and doors, hoping against hope that the noises might
come from their rattling, but the noises answered, "as if
in mockery."
At length the youngest child, Kate, "who in her guile
less innocence had become familiar with the invincible
knocker until she was more amused than alarmed at its
presence, merrily exclaimed, 'Here, Mr. Splitfoot, do as
I do.' "4 The effect was instantaneous, and the first mir
acle of Spiritualism —and perhaps its greatest —was per
formed. The invisible rapper imitated the number of her
movements. Then the child, after the spirit had rapped
as many times as she had indicated with her fingers, ex
claimed, "Only look, Mother! It can see as well as hear."
These words revealed "the sublimest Spiritual Truth of
modern times." They were "words which declare a truth
that has already become the firm foundation for an ever-
progressive Spiritual Church." The mother, astounded
by the scene she had witnessed, herself grew bold and
asked the ages of her children. The answers were dis
tinctly and correctly rapped out. This was proof per
fect. After further questions, she asked the spirit if the
neighbours could be summoned. The reply was—by a
number of taps agreed upon by the two parties —in the af
firmative, and with the coming of the neighbours and

ithe continuation of the marvel, Spiritualism was born.
That, in fine, is how Spiritualism began. Before
sketching its speedy growth to maturity —a feat as mar
velous as any performed by any of its mediums—I should
indicate that the Fox sisters later explained the method
by which they produced the spirit phenomena in the
lowly hut at Hydesville. Explained is a charitable word
to use. Margaret, the older sister and the more capable
of the two, repudiated her connexion with the movement
entirely, told the world that it was humbuggery of the
grossest sort, and, not content with this, gave a public
performance in New York in 1888, during which she
showed the audience that the mysterious rappings of the
spirit were performed with her big toe and the big toe
of her sister Kate.
The two girls, as a matter of fact, never believed in
Spiritualism. Had they known what they were starting
when they bamboozled their parents during those March
nights in Hydesville, they would never have resorted to
such methods of entertainment as that of tying apples to
the bed and pulling them quickly back under the covers
when Farmer Fox got up to investigate the weird sounds
In his house. Nor would they have cultivated such dex
terous toes. But once begun, the fraud was hard to stop.
The neighbours became frantic. Religious furor was at
its height. The whole affair was taken so naively and
fervently as the hand of God that the children feared
for their lives if they should divulge the lowly origin of
the new revelation. They found themselves saints, with
all the discomfort that comes from being saints. They
were children once, but now they were the centre of a
new dispensation, and they dared not act in any manner
that would cast reflection upon the new gospel they had
brought.
So it was that they went deeper and deeper into the
mysteries. It was not unnatural that Mother Fox should
want to know the identity of the "defleshed immortal"
who talked with her so insistently. Neither was it un
natural that the children should devise the story of a

pedlar who had been murdered in the house before they
came to it. Thus the whole story came out by a series of
questions, and when it was all done, the pedlar himself
was looked upon as a sacred missionary of the new enter
prise. Ben F. Hayden, one of the modern writers of the
movement, would wrest the name of the pedlar from
"that obscurity into which it has been permitted to lapse
and place it among those of the greatest benefactors of
the human race; and like the name of Abou Ben Ad-
hem of old, I would have it 'lead all the rest.' ... In
short, among Spiritualists, at least, I would have the
name of Charles Rosna as familiar as that of Jesus among
Christians." 5
Obviously, the children had become enmeshed in di-
yine circumstances, with even the murdered pedlar be
ing regarded by the villagers as a patron saint of the new
theophany, and it behooved them to make the most of the
bluff they were running. Fortunately, they were capable
of doing just that. And no one knew this better than their
older sister, Leah, who comes now to play her sinister
part in the amazing tragi-comedy of modern Spiritual
ism. Leah was twenty years older than Margaret, the
older of the two children. She was, at the time of the
phenomena, teaching music in Rochester. She lost no
time, however, in getting to the country home of the
family, and she had not been there a day before she knew
just what the secret was. She was never as dexterous as
the younger girls, yet the three of them together became
the three witches of Spiritualism, and they are all equally
adored among devotees of the cult.
I have flashed back for a moment into the circum
stances of the first rappings in order to show the reason
for forty years of silence on the part of the two younger
sisters. They were kept from an earlier recantation by
two things. One was the fear of the religious mob. And
the other was their canny sister, Leah. Margaret had
threatened the exposure many times. And when the words
came in 1888, this is what she had to say of Leah :

24 THE CONFUSION OF JONGUES
She made me do it. She is my damnable enemy. I hate her ! My God,
I could poison her. No, I wouldn't, but I'll lash her with my tongue.
I loathe the thing I have done.
[The documents of the exposure have been preserved
under the rather amusing title of The Death-Blow To
Spiritualism, written by Reuben Briggs Davenport. This
book, published in 1888, bears the signed approval of the
Fox sisters and offers every quotation and citation to dis
prove that the two girls had ever claimed to be spiritual
istic mediums, if by that term is meant one having a pe
culiar access to the pandora box of the supernatural. Of
course the death-blow produced very few results: Spirit
ualism went merrily on, and, as we have seen, the two
Fox sisters are still retained in the capacity of founders
and angelic lasses who brought the good news from
Heaven to earth in 1848. But the story itself is interest
ing, and I shall set it down as economically as possible.
Leah at the outset took the younger girls to Rochester,
where she immediately turned the new religion into gold,
to the delight of the good American people. In the
Hydesville cottage she had learned the secret, and she
had practised hard with her toes meanwhile. She took
Kate with her at first, then persuaded the mother to come
on with Margaret, who was but nine years of age at the
time of the first public demonstration at Rochester. The
demonstrations enlisted the eyes of many distinguished
men of the day —among them Horace Greeley, Ban
croft the historian, Cooper the novelist, and Harriet
(Beecher Stowe. It was obvious that wider fields should
be cultivated, and the march was made upon New York.
Their advent in Gotham was auspicious. Horace
Greeley announced it in the Tribune most favourably and
was the first to call upon them when they reached the city
in 1850. He advised the older sister to charge an admis
sion fee of five dollars —so the Spiritualist writers assert
—in order that the rabble might be kept away. He pub
lished the rules by which the sittings should be conducted
and gave plenty of publicity to the new enterprise.
Greeley's interest, however, was not entirely that of a
publicist. He felt that the children were being made to

serve the ends of their older sister, and if not that, that
they were much too charming to be involved in demon
strations which smacked so much of the sensational and
abnormal. He became interested in Kate in 1855, when
she was then a child of thirteen, and sent her off to school.
She married and later gave up the profession of Spirit
ualism —joining with her sister in its denunciation in
1888. The most important thing he did, however, was to
take the explorer, Dr. Elisha Kent Kane, to see Mar
garet. Kane became at once interested in the child and
sought to induce her to give up the humbuggery —the
term was used freely in his letters to her—and become
his wife. He was, unfortunately for the match, the son of
a wealthy family who resented his passion for one of the
Fox sisters, and after many fervent letters to and from the
arctic, they were forced to be content with a common law
marriage.
Soon after this Kane sailed for England, promising
soon to return and claim his bride. But he died before
the two ever met again. A child was born to Margaret
Fox Kane, and she found herself without means of sup
port. She drifted back into Spiritualism, later began to
drink heavily, and at last broke with Leah and entered
the Roman Catholic Church. It was upon her return to
America from abroad in 1888 that she made her star
tling recantation of the Spiritualist doctrine and gave
such convincing proof of its fraudulence. Kane had shel
tered her from the world for three or four years. After
his death in 1857, she was ill for many months, and when
she recovered she was penniless. For thirty years before
her exposure, she lived in constant dread and fear of
Leah.
These were the facts which she revealed in her inter
view with New York reporters. She told them that often
after seances she would drown her remorse in wine. She
felt that she was guilty of the worst humbuggery she
could possibly perpetrate on the human race. Regarding
the spirit manifestations which were supposed to have
taken place shortly before in Carlyle's English home, she
said: "I know that every so-called manifestation pro

duced through me in London or anywhere else was a
fraud." She continued:
I repented in my maturity. I lived through years of silence, through
intimidation, scorn, and bitter adversity, concealing as best I might the
consciousness of my own guilt. ... I am at last able to reveal the fatal
truth, the exact truth of this hideous fraud which has withered so many
hearts and has blighted so many hopeful lives.
She arranged for a public demonstration of the mar
vels that had taken on divine meaning in the hearts of
millions of her contemporaries. At that time she said: "I
am here tonight as one of the founders of Spiritualism
to denounce it as an absolute falsehood from beginning
to end, as the flimsiest of superstitions, the most wicked
blasphemy known to the world." That was all she could
say, for the number of her enemies in the audience and
the disturbance which they caused, together with the
state of nervous exhaustion she was in, prevented the
elucidation she had planned to give. The World of Oc
tober 22, 1888, carried this report:
But if her tongue had lost its power her preternatural toe-joint
had not. A plain, wooden stool or table, resting on four short legs
and having the properties of a sounding board, was placed in front of
her. Removing her shoes, she placed her right foot on this table. The
entire house became breathlessly still, and was rewarded by a number
of short, sharp raps —those mysterious sounds which have for more
than forty years frightened and bewildered hundreds of thousands of
people in this country and Europe. A committee consisting of three
physicians taken from the audience then ascended to the stage, and hav
ing made an examination of her foot during the progress of the "rap-
pings," unhesitatingly agreed that the sounds were made by the action
of the first joint of her large toe.
An investigation conducted by the University of Buf
falo years before had come near detecting this source of
the rappings. It has worked on the theory, however, that
the noises were produced by the knees of the fair per
formers, and its findings had therefore been discredited
successfully by the Spiritualists. The probability that the
sounds came from supernatural sources was reduced by
the discovery that they did not come at all when the
knees of the ladies were held securely. But Leah —Mrs.

Fish at that time; she had as many different names as
Mrs. Eddy —pointed out that the friendly spirits with
drew "when they witnessed such harsh proceedings on the
part of our persecutors . . . and it was not in our power
to detain them."
With the demonstration of Margaret Fox Kane, the
evidence was conclusive. That is why Reuben Briggs
Davenport got out his book and called it The Death-
^Bloiv to Spiritualism. It was, of course, nothing of the
sort. It caused only the slightest ripple on the Spiritualis
tic sea, and, since the theatrical expose was not a financial
success, the apostate Fox sister was soon forced back into
the trade, though she never had much success after that.
In time she faced the pleasant dilemma of recanting her
recantation or starving in the land of the free. There is
some evidence to show that she did make this recanta
tion; at any rate she was restored to favour among the
Spiritualists, for the very good reason that they could
never admit the truth of her confession. She died toward
the close of the century in obscurity and squalor.

And what of the new religion all the while? It had
swept the continent like a plague. Its statistics have al
ways been suspect and the National Spiritualist Associa
tion has the habit of referring to its constituency in
addition to its membership. This constituency seems to
comprise almost everyone who has ever lost a relative. In
her recantation, Margaret Fox Kane expressed the hope
that her words would disillusion at least some of "the
eight million Spiritualists in this country." The estimates
have been placed variously by inspired writers of the
cult at four million in 1868, twenty million in 1875, and
sixty million in 1884. The United States Census of 1900
reported 45,000.
Whatever the figure, the early growth of Spiritualism
was incredible. The land was of course prepared for its
advent. The churches of America were as yet imperfectly

lievers from one cult to another was not uncommon. [The
Millerites were recruited from various evangelical enter
prises, and when the ascension robes purchased by the
order proved useless, a host of them went over to the
Shakers. Everywhere there was a state of religious up
roar and instability among the pioneering elements and
the lonely villagers. Everywhere there was the greatest
readiness to entertain religious novelty. The Methodists
were at war with the Campbellites, and both were vy
ing for converts by the approved methods of the day.
The Mormons were stationed in Navvoo, and their
ranks were swelling each day with proselytes from the
various sects of Protestantism. The villages and the towns
were poorly controlled by the culture of the cities, and
the ideas of what was natural and what was supernatural
were very primitive. Also, the rise of Swedenborgianism,
the rise and decline of mesmerism, and the need of an
equally exciting substitute, paved the way with gold for
the coming of the New Revelation. Furthermore, the
Universalists had played whaley with the idea of the old-
time hell, and the people were in a pleasant state of mind
to believe that the commonly held opinions of heaven and
hell were travesties. The world was ready for a new
heaven, if not for a new earth. The corps of workers and
lecturers who sold Spiritualism to the land were re
cruited almost entirely from Universalist and Sweden-
borgian clergymen.
By 1850 the movement was thinly spread from Canada
to New York, and westward as far as St. Louis. By 1851
there were six Spiritualistic organs in the country, each
eager to print the most astounding news of the new
phenomena that it could procure. There were lectur
ers of some skill and men of some prominence in the
ranks. Judge Edmonds of the Superior Court of New
York had become converted and had lent his eloquent
tongue to the cause. Discontented Presbyterians —among
them Dr. Jesse Babcock Ferguson, who travelled with the
famous Davenport Brothers and gave their performance
a Spiritualistic colour —were numbered with the leaders.

been the amanuensis through which the revelation of a
new philosophy had come to the world by way of Andrew
Jackson Davis.
All in all the personnel in the very early years was ex
perienced if not imposing. The movement really mani
fested itself, however, among the lowly and the lonely.
The attraction of the big men was stagecraft and it is
important only insofar as it shows how completely the
whole population was swept into the maelstrom. For by
the end of 1849 there was nothing short of chaos in
American religious life. Mrs. Emma Hardinge tells us
that infuriated Irish Catholics would often break into the
meetings and chase the Spiritualists from room to room.
She continues:
Two or three of "the Prophets" would be jabbering in known
tongues at once, while others would be shouting the war-whoop of the
Red Indian. Apostolic letters, in miserable grammar and words spell
ing, were palmed off as geniune productions of the seventh sphere.8
It was commonly supposed among the people that the
world had entered into a new dispensation and that there
had begun on the American continent an unparalleled
outpouring of the Holy Ghost. Everywhere the compari
son to Pentecost was on the lips of the people, and the
most amazing things began to happen. The shade of Ben
jamin Franklin appeared and explained that he was now
at the head of a college of spirits which would aid hu
manity to restore its faith in the divine. A man by the
name of John Murray Spear announced that the eager
spirits of the dead had indeed and in truth organized
themselves into colleges in order to assist in the regenera
tion of the earth. There were bands of "Governmentiz-
ers, Educationizers, Agriculturalizers, Healthfulizers,
Electrizers," and, apparently, of Fertilizers, for there
were a number of immaculate conceptions during the
period. The Electrizers had commanded Spear to per
fect a new electric turban which would revolutionize in
dustry and enable humanity to live on four hours of work

a day. Some effort was made by a curious and later in
censed citizenry to see the new marvel, and Spear, in
great straits, explained that a wanton mob had stolen
into his barn and destroyed the machine. He had also
received messages to the effect that the Angelic Associa
tion of Electrizers had felt the time not yet ripe and hu
manity not yet appreciative enough for the revelation of
the mystery.
There was nothing too extraordinary for at least a hun
dred thousand of our citizens to believe. Indeed, they
would believe nothing unless it was extraordinary. We
were in the midst of the last great religious uproar be
fore the dawn of modern science. The Spiritualist paper
that could get the most grotesque story got the biggest
circulation. Salutations from the nether world were com
monplace —and have continued to be. A Dr. Dexter of
New York published a long communication from Svve-
denborg (who spelled his own name in the spirit message
"Sweedenborg"). At Auburn, New York a Mrs. Tamlin,
a mesmeric healer, ignorant of music, fell into a trance,
took up a harp and "poured forth such strains that any
attempt to describe their beauty must fail." The Au
burn Apostolic Circle was visited by a select group of
spirits —among them Moses, Paul, Daniel, and John.
Two Universalist clergymen joined the earthly group,
and, following the method of several other lamented
groups before and since, about one hundred of the circle
moved out from wicked Auburn to set up an ideal com
munity at Mountain Cove. They broke up in unsavoury
scandals and quarrels.
In 1853 Judge Edmonds discovered with much delight
that he was himself a medium. His feats, and those of his
daughter Laura, are now preserved for the incredulous
in a group of his own letters sent to the papers of the day.
The thirteen-year-old daughter of ex-governor Tall-
madge of Wisconsin vied with the daughter of Judge
Edmonds and both girls bamboozled their fathers into
complete and lasting faith. The daughter of J. B. Fergu

strange concoction which the spirits brewed in an empty
cup held in her hand as she passed into a trance.
A musical craze swept the land. Men and women
who had never touched instruments before sat down and
played with "unmistakable individuality." One young
girl was seized by the spirit of Mozart and the spirit of
Beethoven. Mrs. Hardinge tells us that this child "did
marvellous improvisations," and that many others occa
sionally did "new and entirely sublime compositions."
Up in Connecticut a Reverend Dr. Phelps found that
his house had been thrown into complete disorder by
the spirits. The windows were broken. The furniture was
pulled about and missiles were thrown in from every
direction. Turnips, with strange hieroglyphics carved on
them, grew right out of the dining-room floor. Letters
fell from the ceiling. An umbrella was mysteriously
seized and thrown for twenty-five feet. One member of
the family, going upstairs to an empty bedroom, found
in it "eleven figures of angelic beauty." This same mem
ber of the family reported that "before each angelic
figure was an open Bible and each angelic finger
pointed to some passage in favour of Spiritualism."
Andrew Jackson Davis was summoned from New York
to decipher the hieroglyphics on the turnips.
Nor was this the half of it. Everywhere the most lowly
and incompetent people became powerful media of the
current which God had loosed upon the continent of
North America. One respectable young lady went into
a trance that lasted forty-five days, and she awoke a
powerful medium. Beyond doubt a new economy had
come to pass. Out in Dover Village, Ohio, Jonathan
Koons devised a spirit machine which like the modern
radio centred the manifestations of the spirit world in
one gigantic receiving set. He was thoughtful enough to
provide phosphorous for the spirits to dip their hands
in, so that there could be no question about their mani
festations. Because of his foresight and ingenuity, he
was visited nightly by a special band of very ancient
spirits. They had lived on the earth before Adam, a fact
which caused the Spiritualists no alarm, for they had

junked the old theology in the midst of the new and un
precedented outpouring of the Holy Ghost. Each night
these spirits sang choruses for the sitters, providing "a
foretaste of heaven on earth."
The idea of erecting special houses or receiving sta
tions with especially rich centres of manifestation grew,
after Koon's experience and farmers in the vicinity found
that they could get similar phenomena by the conversion
of an old outhouse into a shrine for the emissaries of
the glory world. In many of these guns were fired and
drums were beaten with great ado and gusto by the spirits
that man had imagined to be so frail and impotent. And
if strength was shown by the spirits in a physical way, it
was manifested equally by them in the spiritual realm. A
man by the name of Miller was overpowered by the
spirits while lecturing against the new craze, and like
Paul on the road to Damascus, he was converted on the
spot.
As I have said, nothing was incredible unless it seemed
ordinary. The Spiritualist papers scooped the modern
tabloids by fifty years or more, and their circulation rose
with the tide of hysteria. They were only too glad to re
port that an Ohio tailor named Rogers got the afflatus
and began to paint the most exquisite and inimitably
faithful pictures of dead people he had never seen.
Flames, pillars of fire, and smoke in towering columns
broke out in a Pennsylvania town and were seen by all.
Throughout what is now widely called the Bible belt,
men, women, and children mounted on benches and be
gan to shout in strange tongues. In the black district the
fire influence spread and negroes would thrust their hands
into the flames or stand on live coals with their naked
feet. And if these manifestations occurred among the
lowly and the common, we may well imagine the audacity
of the professional mediums, of whom there were more
than thirty thousand in i854-7

library. There is hardly a departed dignitary for the past
two thousand years who has not been called back to earth
for his message to humanity. Every medium became an
amanuensis for some lamented celebrity and every one
published the results in a tome of no importance. W. T.
Stead, known both in Spiritualist and Theosophical cir
cles, claimed to have seen the Spirit of an Egyptian who
had departed this life over three thousand years ago.
"For several minutes," he records, "the Spirit was dis
tinctly visible to us munching an apple, but I felt so ex
hausted by the loss of magnetism and nervous as well
that I asked him to leave us. I will never forget his soul
ful expression." The departed hosts were in every case
simply struggling to get in touch with those on earth
again and it is not in the least surprising that the feats of
the day were performed by some of the most notable
men of earth's history. The Spirits even went so far as
to edit magazines. Houdini reports that The Spirit Mes
senger and The Star of Truth were published in 1852 by
H. P. Ambler of Springfield, Massachusetts. They were
"edited and composed by Spirits." Not even the publisher
was allowed to put his mundane hand in the enterprise.
It was simply his business to put before the people the
elucidations of the Spirits on every conceivable topic of
interest. The Northwestern Orient, published in 1052 by
C. H. White, contained communications from John
Adams, Edgar Allan Poe, John Wesley, George White-
field, Thomas Paine, and others.8
It is not necessary, however, to prowl about in the
Nineteenth Century for the works of departed geniuses
who have made mediums the vehicles of their expres
sions. A book, Oscar Wilde from Purgatory, has just
been published in New York, where its message was re
ceived through two mediums. Out in St. Louis there is a
Scientific Seance Club, the records of whose meetings
contain over two hundred speeches delivered by a hun
dred and fifty speakers from the Spirit World. It has of
late published the discourses of Robert Green Ingersoll
and the eminent Baptist, Charles Haddon Spurgeon. It

reports that "the evening's program is always arranged
on the spirit side" and the members of the Circle never
know beforehand who the speaker is to be. Moreover,
'Jesus' Teaching By Shakespeare's Spirit was published as
late as 1922. It is recorded on the title page that this
monumental work was taken by the direct dictation of
the spirit's voice. "No alterations in any Mss. dictated by
this spirit." Shakespeare, it seems, turned theologian
when he reached his home beyond the skies and has been
devoting his energies since that day to the conversion of
the race, for this is not the only title which appears un
der the heading of his posthumous works. A part of
the dedication will suffice to show how spiritually
minded he became:
7 dedicate this book to every soul within the body case who derides
the truth for which Jesus came from God to prove for his Father.
And if the skeptic feels that death may have dulled
the genius of the bard, I can only cite lines from the
opening sonnet:
Sonnet. For my Lord
Written by Shakespeare's soul
LORD of my soul, my part for Thee, I bring
To better here the part Thou say'st of Thee
Who gave me Thy eternal, breathless Time
To praise and worship as Thou gavest me.
Every extravagance and absurdity which has been
practised by Spiritualism in recent years, however, found
its origin and its better among the practitioners of that
early day. As McCabe points out (Spiritualism: A Popu
lar History from 1847), Spiritualism reached the zenith
of its interest five years after it originated. It slumped
then until the seventies, made some new progress toward
the close of the century, but was practically dead at the
outbreak of the World War. He estimates that both its
influence and its numbers were doubled and possibly
trebled by the war. But the good old days of credulity
and universal hilarity in faith have never returned. The
approach today is colder and more scientific, and the
public at large more irreverently suspicious. The conse

quence is that the methods and devices of the mediums
and those who seek to demonstrate it to the world are
more sophisticated and better conceived. No medium to
day would think of using her toes for the production of
phenomena, though the famous Margery, whom Hou-
dini detected in Boston a year before his death, resorted
to devices dangerously close to those by which the Fox sis
ters first made the hoax a faith.
Exposure and ill repute began early to plague the new
dispensation. The decadence of religions contemporane
ous with its rise threw more than one fakir out of work
and made him pine for a means of livelihood. The mes
merists flocked to the new standard which had been
so auspiciously raised, and such pariahs as John Mur
ray Spear and other Socialists and free lovers joined
the movement and outraged the whole faith in the minds
of staunch and true Americans. Spear started a free love
colony at Kiatone Springs, New York, and was soon
involved in scandalous practices which the country as
a whole has never learned to associate with the prac
tice of religion. Among others were the followers of
Robert Dale Owen, and though the country could accept
the fact of hieroglyphics on turnips with equanimity and
comparative calm, it could not tolerate the thought that
false economics might be associated with the return of
the Lord to his own. A Dr. and Mrs. Spencer founded
the Harmonial Society in Kansas in the Fifties. There
were fifty in the group and they began with five thou
sand dollars in capital. Land and love were free and
cheap for a while, but mutiny against the Spencers soon
developed into a mad uprising, and the leaders were
forced to take to their heels across the Kansas prairies.
Mrs. Spencer, it appears, had alleged that she received
the finery in which she bedecked herself from the spirit
world —but this seemed improbable, even to the faithful.
In 1854 came the Order of Patriarchs. The founder re
ceived through the mail a supply of ancient tablets which
contained the constitution and by-laws of a free love
community, which he was instructed to establish. These
outrages to American propriety began to leave the hint

in a great many solid minds that Spiritualism might not
after all be of the Lord. The psychology of the crowd
turned against it and hostility arose on every hand. It was
nothing but the dexterity of such men as D. D. Home that
carried the movement through the slump that followed
the earliest detections of fraud.
Then in 1888 came the recantation of the Fox sisters.
Kate Fox had married a London barrister by the name of
Jencken and of course everyone imagined that prodigies
would issue from so gifted a family. After the birth of the
child it was reported that these marvels had begun to oc
cur. The child seized at the age of five months a pencil
and wrote a long edifying message in clear script. But
before he was fifteen his mother had denounced Spirit
ualism as humbuggery and had said that no single item
of it had its source in the realm of the supernatural. By
1865 the new movement had found its way to the Mother
land but a series of exposures decimated the ranks there
after 1873. McCabe declares that almost every promi
nent medium there was detected in fraud between 1874
and 1884. Henry Slade for a time restored the drooping
prestige of the movement, but within a few weeks he
was in the hands of the police.
IV
So it goes. The controversy begins. The sceptics and
scoffers assail the validity of the practices and the me
diums strike back. The result is that the whole story of
Spiritualism since the excesses which a credulous public
gulped gladly enough in the early days has been a story
of controversy and testing. It amounts to You didn't! and
I did! Pushed to a corner, the mediums assign their fail
ure to evil spirits or to the hypnotism of sceptics in the
circle, and since a vast proportion of the human race is
only too glad to believe that we can communicate with
the dead, no end of exposure has the slightest effect upon
that portion of the public who embrace the faith.

statement of the case against the work of mediums may

refer to Houdini's book, A Magician Among the Spirits.
Houdini wanted badly, as badly as any man could, to
believe that we can communicate with the departed. He
speaks of his mother in heaven as though he were an
evangelist making a plea for sinners. He went so far as
to make solemn compacts with fourteen of his best
friends, by which signs were arranged and it could be
easily determined if they communicated with him after
their departure. He was a man who would have em
braced Spiritualism if he could have found anything in
the least authentic in its methods. But, after twenty-five
years of intensive study and observation, he ended by de
nouncing it for precisely what its founders called
it,
a
fraud.
A second fact that gives credence to his verdict
is
the
astounding reputation he has for mystifying
a
critical as
well as
a
credulous public. All over the world he has
gone, performing feats that the most meticulous observer
declared to be impossible. Yet he has never assigned these
feats to the work of supernatural powers. He simply does
them because he knows magic. And that, says Houdini,
is
precisely what the mediums do. His verdict is: "I have
not found one incident that savoured of the genuine. If
there had been any real unalloyed demonstration to work
on, one that did not reek of fraud, one that could not be
reproduced by earthly powers, then there would be some
thing for
a
foundation. But up to the present time every
thing
I
have investigated has been the result of deluded
brains or those which were too actively willing to be
lieve."

He attended over
a
hundred seances during his
last trip abroad in 1919 and he has at his command the
largest library on Spiritualism in the world. Yet "noth

have ever read concerning the so-called Spiritual
ist phenomena has impressed me as being genuine."
J.
Hewat McKenzie, in his book Spirit Intercourse, in
common with not
a
few other Spiritualists, goes so far as
to assign supernatural powers to Houdini, and describes
some of his stunts to prove the point. He claims that Hou

admit it. Which may be perfectly true, but Houdini took
the stunts to which Hewat refers and said that his de-
materialization was nothing but a trick, and that he could
prove it any time. The chief stunt referred to is the one
in which Houdini escaped from a sealed tub of water at
the front of the stage and appeared at the back of the
stage twenty seconds later.
In a sketch of this kind I shall be able to cite only a
few of the cases in which the most prominent mediums
have turned out to be frauds. Houdini knew Ira Daven
port of the famous Davenport Brothers, who elaborated
upon the simple knockings and got some rather startling
effects. They were accompanied on their tours by the
Reverend Dr. Ferguson, who made a little speech at the
outset of the performance and left the impression with
the audience that they were witnessing actual manifes
tations of the supernatural. Ira and his brother William
thought it would be better showmanship not to disen
chant the public, and they let it go at that. In fact, both
of their parents died believing that their boys were the
conveyors of supernatural powers. But, as I say, Hou
dini got to know Ira before he died. While playing in
Australia he had heard that William was buried there.
Accordingly he went to his grave and found it in
wretched condition. He beautified
it,
and in appreciation
of this act, Ira told him, upon his return to New York,
of the famous Davenport rope tie,
a
secret that not even
the family of the Davenport brothers had ever learned.
From him he learned, too, that the performance of the
brothers with Ferguson, involving the use of cabinet, rope
tricks, bells, and various horns and musical instruments,
was executed entirely by means of physical dexterity
and showmanship.
Then there was Daniel Douglas Home, he who rubbed
shoulders with the potentates of the earth and finally died
a
wretch, "from
a
terrible spinal disease," says Ma
dame Blavatsky, "brought on through intercourse with
'Spirits.'

for it led to a great many others. He had the appearance
of being ill, and he assumed a rather pious expression
which won him his way to the hearts of a great many
kindly old ladies. He was, on the whole, a man of charm
and intellect, a gentleman who moved in the best society
and who accustomed himself to its manners. For example,
he charged no fees for his sittings, but somehow his
friends managed to keep him in luxury. He performed
always as a guest. Houdini reports that Robert Brown
ing attended one of Home's seances. The poet had grown
somewhat perturbed over his wife's earnest interest in the
new faith, and so was in the mood for a showdown. When
a face was materialized and said to be that of a son who
had died in infancy, Browning seized the materialized
head and found it to be the bare foot of the medium. In
cidentally, Browning had never lost an infant son.
In his day, which was a glorious one, Home had the
honour of duping celebrities. Not everyone grabbed his
foot. In this country he performed to the satisfaction of
iWilliam Cullen Bryant, and it was shortly after this that
friends raised the cash for his invasion of Europe. There
he numbered among his patrons the Emperor and Em
press of France and the Czar of Russia. He lived for
weeks at a time in the palace of the Czar, and during one
of these stop-overs he dematerialized some of the royal
jewels. They were found later in his hip pocket. In Eng
land he prevailed upon the spirit of a widow's husband
to adopt him and for a long while the spirit, through the
widow, provided sumptuously for him. He received
from her a payment of seven hundred pounds a year and
later she made over a large fortune to him. This she soon
sued to recover and did recover, the court saying in part
that she was saturated with delusion and characterizing
Spiritualism, according to the evidence, as "a system of
mischievous nonsense well calculated to delude the vain,
the weak, the foolish, and the superstitious." This de
cision was rendered in 1868, and it had about as much ef
fect upon Home's reputation as the recantation of the
Fox sisters had on the movement as a whole. He went

William Crookes, who pronounced him "a man whose
perfect genuineness was above suspicion."
By far the grossest fake Spiritualism ever foisted upon
humanity was that of Ann O'Delia Diss Debar. Her
fraudulence stank so high into heaven that even the Spirit
ualists reluctantly disowned her; she is one of the fallen
apostles, a Spirit Judas, I should say. How she has es
caped depiction in the midst of the contemporary rage
for biography is a question fortunately out of my prov
ince to answer. She would reward any man who would
prowl through the frightening corridors of her earthly
life. Yet the meticulous biographer would have trouble
with details, for we do not know when or where she was
born, nor do we have the slightest trace of her death. We
only know that her victims ranged from poor bereaved
nit-wits to some of the shrewdest fellows on the Street,
and that her deals occasionally ran into the hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
It is supposed by those who have taken the pains to
inquire that she was the daughter of a political refugee
by the name of Salomen who settled in Kentucky, and
that she was born in 1849, though there are no documents
to indicate it. She left home before she reached the age
of puberty and was not heard of again until her father
found her moving proudly and easily among the bloods
of Baltimore society. At that time she posed as a member
of the European aristocracy and the Baltimore four hun
dred were only too glad to have a woman so celebrated
at their tables. She had not yet taken up Spiritualism as a
means of getting what she wanted. She would simply
worm her way into the affections of the younger set, then
explain that she needed fifty thousand or more and that
her banker in Bavaria was often careless in sending
checks the moment she needed them worst. The young
men would advance the money —so agreeably, in fact,
that she swindled the lot of them out of a quarter of a
million.
Sin would have its way with her, however, and it was

smoking of opium cigarettes and soon lay in a hospital,
suffering from complete nervous exhaustion. While there
she attempted to stab the nurse and attendant and was in
consequence confined to an asylum for the insane. The
authorities found in her not the slightest trace of insanity
and after a year she was released. It was then that she
found her General Diss Debar, married him, and used
him as a means of entree to the best society of the day.
The first of her victims was Luther R. Marsh, a bril
liant New York attorney. She gave him messages pur
porting to come from his recently deceased wife, which
he accepted with relish, and Ann O'Delia Diss Debar
had found her calling. She would be a medium. By the
high cunning that marked all of her movements, she
prevailed upon Marsh to transform his home at 166 Mad
ison Avenue into a Spiritualist Temple of which she was
the High Priestess. Here she did a thriving business, re
stricting herself entirely to a clientele drawn from the
upper classes. Things were going well for the enterprise
when the spirit of Marsh's daughter suggested during one
of the seances that he deed his property to Mrs. Diss De
bar. Marsh readily consented, the deeds were drawn, and
the whole hoax would have been complete had not the
relatives of the attorney intervened and thrown the case
into the courts. Ann and her husband were arrested and
held for trial.
During the trial that followed, Ann fortunately re
ceived from the spiritual world advice to return the prop
erty. This advice, she said, came from Cicero and "his
colleagues in the council of ten." It was also during the
trial that Carl Hertz, a professional conjuror and mes
merist of no mean repute, proved to the satisfaction of the
court that all of the medium's spells were bound by a
clever application of ordinary physical law. To demon
strate his contention he was good enough to perform her
own tricks in the open court.
But Marsh's faith was unshaken by the exposures. He
gave hearty assent to a personal communication that he
had received concerning his wife from St. Peter, and this
was read into the records of the court. Nor was the jury

as a whole any too sure that the woman was a fraud.
Eleven of its members were, but the twelfth, on learning
that Ann was an illegitimate daughter, said he thought
she ought to receive a square deal, with the result that
the jury disagreed and Ann and her husband went to
Blackwell's Island for six months. When released they
left America very shortly and reappeared in London un
der the names of Laura and Theodore Jackson. They
were soon in trouble there for setting up an immoral cult
called Theocratic Unity. In this cult Jackson was sup
posed to be Christ reincarnate and there had been devised
a rather elaborate and smutty initiation ceremony in
volving young girls. One of the victims squealed, and
made the allegation that Jackson had outraged her in
the presence of his wife. This he denied, saying that he
was physically incapable of it and asking for a medical
examination. He got a legal one instead, and in 1901 Ann
and her husband were sent to prison for seven years. They
served five years and were released for spotless behaviour.
Ann came to New York, then later went to Chicago,
where she was known as Vera Ava. There she married
wealth, but two years later she landed in the Joliet peni
tentiary. Once more she appeared on the American cir
cuit, this time in New Orleans, where she was known as
Baroness Rosenthal —then in 1909 she dropped out of
existence and has never been heard of since. Her picture
may be seen in any rogue's gallery.
Ann I do not regard as the model of mediums, nor
have I sketched her sordid story to asperse Spiritualism.
She was admittedly a fraud, yet her most piteous victim
would not admit it. She is typical in that she preyed upon
the bereavement of a man of wealth by means of alleged
preternatural communications. She is also typical of a
large host of adventurers who were attracted to the move
ment by the chance it gave for gain. And it is quite pos
sible that, had she not been humiliated by a magician in
the court room, or, let us say, had she got none too far
with Luther Marsh, she might have stood today in one
of those special niches which the Spiritualists chisel for
their saints. She illustrates very well the fact that presti

digitation for economic gain and under the guise of su
pernatural power has played a gross and conspicuous part
in the history of Spiritualism.
Space will not allow me to tell of the invention of spirit
photography by a devout Dr. Garnder and a Mr. Wil
liam Mumler, and of the big trial that resulted in New
York, Judge Edmonds testifying for the state and P. T.
Barnum for the defence; nor to tell of Eusapiax Palla-
dino, the conceded marvel of all mediums. But the story
is much the same. The devout are ready to concede that
the Lord is in the whirlwind, and the magicians and scep
tics are doubtful. The tests are made and the result is
never satisfactory. So it is that the progress of Spiritual
ism has continued unabated in the face of all sorts of
ridicule and detection, for the sufficient reason that it
teaches people what they want to believe and offers a
machinery that works nine times out of ten to demonstrate
its teaching. Its chief tenet is that we can communicate
with loved ones who have gone before; its method is a
practice which devout and credulous people regard as
divine and which others regard as legerdemain. The es
sential phenomena, however, are there. Spiritualism has
its machinery and if that machinery occasionally falls
down, why, the same may be said of any religion.
We must not forget that it is a religion and not a stage
performance. The essential question does not seem to me
to be whether the mediums actually work by natural
means, but whether or not people who attend their sittings
believe they work by preternatural means. The answer
here is obvious. The worshippers approach their service
as a religious act. They expect to have something accom
plished which will give them a sense of security and
peace in an uncertain universe. They generally get it.
After all, it is rather difficult to determine just where the
natural leaves off and the supernatural begins, just what
is accomplished by nature and what is accomplished by
God. A group of Southern Presbyterians may assemble to

pray for rain. I have seen that often enough, and I have
seen them to all appearances invoke the help of the Lord
quite successfully to get what they wanted. Every re
ligion has its priests, its paraphernalia, its instruments
and devices for cajoling the divine good will. If these
instruments happen to fail in any instance, the blame is
placed quickly upon the instruments and upon those who
use them. It is the same with Spiritualism. I do not mar
vel that the exposures have had little or no effect upon it
as a religion. Hundreds of thousands have approached
its shrines bent upon getting something through control
of supernatural forces. They knew what they wanted and
they got
it,
and whatever the critics of Spiritualism may
say, they cannot deny that
it
satisfies, through its elabo
rate machinery, the craving of its followers for security
and comfort. That
is
about all any religion has ever hoped
to do or ever can do.
We need not be surprised, then, at the faith of Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle and Sir Oliver Lodge. Their scien
tific attitude simply doesn't carry over into the field of
their religion. "Sir Arthur believes. In his great mind
there
is
no doubt," says Houdini, who knew the novelist
intimately for years and studied his attitude minutely.
He still insists that the Fox sisters were genuine and
believes that Home and Palladino will some day be can-
nonized. He
is
convinced that the nice old lady mediums
could do nothing wrong, and his personal experience
is
adequate testimony to his faith. "Six times," he says, "I
have spoken face to face with my son, twice with my
brother and once with my nephew, all beyond doubt in
their own voices and on private matters, so for me there
is
not, nor has been for
a
long time, any doubt." He be
gan in 1919 to traverse Great Britain with marvellous
energy and enthusiasm; his good work continued until
the spring of 1920, when the literature of exposure began
to be written all over again.
Sir Oliver Lodge wrote nothing on Spiritualism prior
to 1904 and his aggressive interest was not manifest un

Spiritualist message. Sir Oliver lost a son who was very
dear to him, and much of his communication since that
time has been with that son. In his book, Raymond, he
has included a description of the next world which goes
into such detail that it tells of flowers and cattle and dogs
and houses, and even cigars.
The approach of both these distinguished men is fun
damentally religious. That I do not mean as any reflection
upon their veracity or intelligence, for there is much in
the statement that man is incurably religious. He finds it
difficult to lay aside his scientific attitude when he finds
his sense of security and peace threatened. The belief of
these two men rises from something which is dearest to
their emotional natures, and the fact that they are scien
tists in one field does not make them affective skeptics in
all fields. As Houdini phrases it, "The fact that they are
scientists does not endow them with any special gift for
detecting the sort of fraud used by mediums, nor does
it
bar them from being deceived, especially when they
are fortified in their belief by grief."
In point of fact, Houdini himself was not an able
judge of Spiritualism. He could doubtless detect with
more accuracy than Sir Oliver Lodge the method by
which the medium raised or threw over
a
chest of draw
ers with her toes or reproduced the face of
a
maiden
aunt on her silken shin. But what of that? All of us are
not magicians any more than all of us are scientists, and
the inquiry into the validity and soundness of Spiritual
ist practices must be largely bootless. Scientists can never

been followed by a gulley-washer. The divine element
eludes the investigator, if his purpose be that of honest
inquiry and examination.
What the public believes is hardly as important as
what the sanctum believes. Regarding this there can be
no doubt. In its definition of principles, The National
Spiritualist Assembly of America affirms that "the exist
ence and personal identity of the individual continues
after the change called death." It affirms, moreover, that
communication with "the so-called dead is a fact scien
tifically proven by the phenomena of Spiritualism."
Spiritualist belief further has it that we carry a portion
of our coporeality with us into higher realms, for "after
the change called death, the spirit is still clothed with
matter, but of a more ethereal kind." Given this belief,
it explains a number of phenomena to the satisfaction of
anyone who is not bent upon irrelevant inquiries. We
learn further that "the best imponderable emanations of
the earth gravitate to what we call the spiritual world
and help to form its substance." In short, Spiritualism
arranges the world, even the cosmos, to suit its purposes.
It does not rely solely upon the dexterity of the priests
of the craft, but rather the whole system is buttressed by
an imagined world. Still more briefly, it is a religion.
The manual of the church proceeds to define and sanc
tify the various kinds of mediumship and to arrange them
into various holy orders, such as are to be found in every
standard church of Christendom. The advantages of these
varying kinds of mediumship are properly catalogued.
We are informed, for example, that trance mediumship,
"when there is a total unconsciousness in the medium
to events taking place in the mundane sphere, is advan
tageous because it affords protection from the audience."
It has an added advantage for there is danger that the
medium "might be aroused to too much speculation by
the novel ideas which the spirit expresses."
In the manual are to be found carefully prepared in
structions for the establishment of a church in a new com
munity, an album of the traditions once and for all de

sprung up since that day. There is an order of worship,
a series of highblown readings designed to promote faith
in the phenomena, and such information for the reassur
ance of the faithful as the story that it was Nattie May-
nard who counselled "that grand, wise, and tender
hearted man, Abraham Lincoln, to issue the Emancipa
tion Proclamation." And : "Furthermore, Alexander the
Second, of Russia, also freed twenty millions of serfs by
the request of his Spirit Father, Nicholas the First."
We can readily see that table rapping, bells in the
cabinet, spirit photographs, levitation, materializations
and dematerializations, are but the effects of Spiritual
ism, the machinery of the cult. There is sentiment and
theology beneath it all. An ecumenical congress is held by
the Spiritualists every three years. There are today over
two hundred distinct papers and magazines devoted to
the interests of the ism. Churches have been built, tem
ples erected, societies organized, and a Children's Pro
gressive Lyceum instituted. The religion of Spiritualism
has followed, to the point of organizing the children, the
methodology and order of the other institutionalized re
ligions. In America there is a national assembly with
twenty-two state auxiliaries, with over five hundred
affiliated local societies, and many that are not yet
affiliated. It stands prepared and equipped for the pur
pose of giving the world its message.
At the pilgrimages made to the Hydesville Cottage,
which has of late been moved to Lily Dale, New York,
the headquarters of the Spiritualist activity in America,
the worshippers each year place a wreath on the steps
and consecrate themselves anew to the "service of truth
demonstrated." We must not forget that the event which
took place at Hydesville was of divine significance. It
has meaning over and above its importance as the birth
day of modern Spiritualism. It signified the willingness
of the inhabitants of another world to pay us heed and
advise us in the solution of our problems. It was a dis
tinct and unprecedented movement on the part of God
to capture the complete allegiance of sinful man. It occu

hem in Christian circles; indeed the new dispensation,
like that inaugurated by Joseph Smith, was of greater
importance than the Christian era. Like Bahaism, Spirit
ualism is the culmination of previous revelations. Cad-
wallader refers to the Hydesville house as a place where
"through the mediumship of the little Fox girls there
came the glad tidings of great joy that proved to a world
fast passing into materialism that death did not end all
—that the tomb was only a covered bridge, and that our
loved ones, radiant with the light of immortal life" were
.waiting just beyond. It was, in a word, a new gospel, as
far above Christianity as Christianity was above Judaism.
iThe shrine at Lily Dale has become a highly mag
netized centre of spirit manifestation. The friends now
in the spiritual world who desire to make themselves
known find conditions here exceptionally favourable. It
has been carefully fitted out with the furniture of the
period and even the murdered pedlar's trunk is to be
found there. It is reported too that the murder of that
unlucky fellow can easily be reproduced today by me
diums and that even the gurgle of his death gasp is dis
tinctly audible. Everything about it has some significance,
even to the name of the man who moved it there. That
name is B. F. Bartlett, and in connexion with his gra
cious act, W. J. Coleville in Hydesville in History re
marks: "It seems an interesting coincidence that while
Benjamin Franklin was the principal spiritual initiator
of the Rochester knockings, Mr. Bartlett, who was forc
ibly inspired to remove the historic property, rejoices in
the possession of this illustrious cognomen." Cadwallader
reports that, in fact, since the removal of the cottage the
demonstrations of power have been greater than ever
before. Not only can one hear, through the mediumship
of Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin Franklin Bartlett, the gasps
emitted by the pedlar at the time he was murdered, but
even the digging in the cellar at the time the body was
buried. Cadwallader assures us that Mr. and Mrs. Bart
lett stand ready to make affidavits to these facts, if neces
sary.

JHE HOUSE OF DAVID
THE death and final decomposition of Christ's
iYounger Brother, coupled with his conspicuous failure
to rise on the third day, brings to its close a grim and
sordid story in the history of American fanaticism. The
stage was set for a miracle, but Benjamin Purnell failed
to deliver, and the result is that the Israelite House of
David finds itself now in a state of apostolic indecision,-
with its Seventh Messenger in a grave of shame and its
cardinal tenet of the immortality of the body openly up
set. Internal dissension rocks the body and it cannot be
long now until it has gone the way of all spiritual flesh.
It is unfortunate that the story must concern itself
chiefly with Benjamin Purnell's concupiscence. There
are other features more important, and if one follows
merely the course of Benjamin's depredations one gets the
impression that there has been nothing but hilarious
lechery in the House of David since its founding twenty-
five years ago. The truth is that, apart from the substan
tiated charges against the Seventh Messenger, no other
immorality has ever been alleged against the devotees of
the cult. The members, some five hundred in all, are a
worshipful and trustful body of people, as sober as Mor
mons and as simple and lovable as Dukhobors. A great
many of them perform common and skilled labour in
Benton Harbor, Michigan, and I have the testimony of
flippant infidels that they are eminently worthy of their,
hire. Nor are those who remain at the colony for work en
tirely given over to mystic contemplation. There are male
and female orchestras much in demand for dances and

the male division does business under the secular name of
"The Bewhiskered Princes of Jazz." The House owns
an extensive and valuable plant, comprising residences,
parks, offices, shops, hotels, farms and other properties
of much value—the worth of the whole being estimated
at three hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars. Its
grounds form the show place of Berrien County and it
is claimed that over two hundred thousand persons visit
its amusement park during the summer season. Two base
ball teams, one for the road and one for home exhibitions,
are maintained and play a high grade of ball. Several
years ago one member of the road team proved himself
sufficiently capable at first base to draw an offer from the
Chicago White Sox; the offer, however, was contin
gent upon his shaving his beard and cutting his hair,
which he declined steadfastly to do.
But the story turns inevitably upon Benjamin. He was
in his palmy days a striking and picturesque figure, with
flowing and well groomed hair and beard, a broad-
brimmed white hat, and immaculate white clothing. He
wore a gold chain about his neck and carried his two
hundred pounds of muscle and bone with commanding
dignity. He was never cheapened by vulgar contact with
his followers —if some twenty young girls be excepted —
for he knew the value of remaining behind the veil of
the temple. Few of his most trusted followers ever talked
with him at any length and even the closest of them often
cooled their feet before an audience. To his aloofness he
added a strict and intractable system of discipline and a
method of inculcating a spirit of precise obedience to his
commands. On one occasion he rebuked a venerable mem
ber of the cult for allowing members of the girls' or
chestra to receive ice cream sodas from an appreciative
merchant in the city. He was a shrewd if unlettered
prophet. He prohibited unnecessary conversation and
visiting and he forestalled the formation of cliques by
frequently moving the sleeping quarters of the people and
by requiring them to make full and thorough confession
of their minutest movements. Indeed, he had his organi
zation worked out with a consistency and foresight alto

gether admirable, and if it had not been for his penchant
for the company of young girls and the repeated rumours
to which this gave rise, he would probably have kept
sufficient hold upon the body to accomplish his resurrec
tion and thus furnish the miracle that was needed to make
his followers the chosen people of the world. But he came
into conflict with a gentile society which did not accept
his messiahship; charges which were either doubted or
excused within the colony became causes for court ac
tion and a decision was finally rendered banishing him
from his colony.
The House of David is tied up with a series of cults
having their origin in England in 1792. At that time
Joanna Southcott appeared as the first angelic messenger.
She reached the climax of her career when, becoming
large of body, she announced that she was to bear a son
of divine origin on October 19, 18 14. At the appointed
hour Joanna went into a trance and passed into her grave,
—a miscarriage of immaculate conception. Thus the cult
of the seven angelic messengers began. Various others
followed the precedent of Joanna. John Wroe stirred
England between 1822 and 1848 as the fifth messenger
and James Jezreel gave his message out during the period
of 1
87 1 to 1 88 1. At the time of Benjamin Purnell's mani
festation most of the followers of the other messengers
had dispersed, though remnants of the John Wroe or
ganization remained.
It was in line with these precedents that Benjamin
revealed himself to be the Seventh and consummating
Messenger. The text which he fulfilled is found in Reve
lation 10:7, "But the days of the voice of the seventh
angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God
should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the
prophets." Not that Benjamin was the first to claim the
final role in this angelic drama. Michael Mills of De
troit had set up his own hierarchy during the Nineties,
but his lustre as a messiah was somewhat dulled by the
fact that he was convicted of statutory rape on the daugh
ter of a member of the colony, wrought as a claimed
religious rite. Mills, however, left no written message,

and the orthodox followers of David today regard him
as the eighth or false messenger, foretold and consigned
to perdition.1
With Mills out of the running the stage was prepared
for Benjamin Purnell. With Mary Purnell he had been
a member of the Mills colony from 1892 to 1896. He was
born in Kentucky in 1861. He was first married in 1877,
living with his wife for two years and finally deserting
her and the one daughter who resulted from the mar
riage. In 1880 he appeared before a justice of the peace
in Ohio and acknowledged that he and Mary Stollard
were husband and wife. A suit for divorce from his first
wife was filed but never prosecuted. Since she is still
alive, Benjamin began and carried on his career as the
Seventh Messenger as a bigamist. For years he and Mary
lived in Richmond, Indiana, where he plied his trade as
a broom maker and where there fell into his hands the
Flying Roll of Jezreel as the sixth messenger. He readily
accepted the faith of the seven angelic messengers and
some time before 1892 he and Mary went to Detroit,
where they joined the colony of Mills. The records of
that colony show that in 1892 he was one of the Four
Pillars of the colony. The two of them remained at this
colony for four years after Mill's arrest and conviction,
making frequent sallies into the countryside to bear the
message and rake in converts. It was as the cock crew
on the morning of the 12th of March, 1895, that the spirit
of the Lord came upon him and he felt welling up in him
the Seventh Message. He kept discreetly quiet about his
pregnancy but the secret got out and he was promptly
expelled for his treason to Mills. The next six years were
spent as a roving evangelist and street preacher, Ben
jamin plying his trade like Paul of old and preaching
when occasion allowed. All this time he was working on
The Star of Bethlehem, that classic pronunciamento
which should give his message to the world of sin and
greed. The Star was completed in Fostoria, Ohio in 1902

and Benjamin was ready for his manifestation. With six
friends picked up in Ohio, Benjamin and Mary moved
upon Benton Harbor, Michigan. A family of carriage
makers accepted Benjamin as the seventh messenger and
as a token of their faith joined the gathering of the lost
tribes of Israel. A business of more than seventy-five thou
sand dollars was sold and the proceeds turned over to the
Israelite House of David. With this money the present
site of the colony near Benton Harbor was acquired and
the assemblying of the saints began in earnest. In 1903
the remaining adherents of John Wroe in Australia ca
bled Benjamin that they had seen his Message and were
prepared to accept him. With Mary he left Benton Har
bor immediately and visited the John Wroe Church in
Melbourne in a dramatic midnight appearance, with the
result that eighty-six of the John Wroe members accepted
Benjamin and returned with him to Benton Harbor.
iThis pentecostal ingathering is described as follows by
Benjamin in his diary:
We entered the Old House one night while they were holding their
42nd annual watch meeting—and here were fulfilled some very vital
prophecies of John ; and a little trouble, but no one hurt. Finally we all
got ready for our homeward-bound trip, and we brought 85 people
with us, and came through the Indian Ocean into the Red Sea. Very in
teresting indeed 1 Through the Red Sea into the Mediterranean, and
homeward into the Atlantic, landing at New York, and home to that
country from whence we came. Heb. 11-15.2
Shortly after the return of the natives another but
smaller group came from Australia. In 1906 mission
aries were sent to England and they brought back seven
teen converts to swell the ranks. Preachers were sent in
every direction and soon the membership of the colony
grew to the five hundred that it has maintained regularly
since those early years.

ligion as a means of supplying the sex life of its founder,
rests upon a clever bit of exegesis. We have in its credo
a broom maker's interpretation of Holy Writ. The car
dinal tenet is of course Benjamin's inspiration. He was
the Seventh Messenger, and that messenger had a func
tion to perform. He was to complete God's manifestation
to man and provide for the assembling of 144,000 males
and an equal number of females who should never die.
It was with this high purpose that Benjamin and Mary
headed for Australia, and it was with the belief that the
immortality of the body would come to pass that at least
a fraction of the elect accepted the message, sold their
property, and came to Benton Harbor. The same trouble
with the millennium has been experienced among the
members of the House of David as among the follow
ers of Pastor Russell. When The Star of Bethlehem was
first published, it was prophesied that the glad hour
would begin in 1906, but when it failed to show up Ben
jamin explained that everything was really in the Lord's
hands and that he would bring his events to pass in due
season. According to the testimony of W. T. Dewhirst,
the attorney of the colony, the prophecy of Matthew
that, "This generation shall not pass away until these
things be fulfilled" had reference to the generation alive
in 1916. All those alive in 1916 who were members of the
colony and fell not from the faith should live for ever.
But still the Lord tarries.
There is some similarity between the House of David
and the Shakers, for the modern ascetics hold that evil
derives from sexual intercourse and that the immortality
of the body can only be attained by eliminating evil from
the blood. This requires a total abstinence even among
married couples. Adam and Eve were originally pure,
but evil was communicated to Eve through sexual inter
course with the serpent, and to Adam by intercourse with
Eve. It is of course not impossible to achieve a "blood
less state," in which event intercourse will again be per
missible, for children born of such intercourse will not
be conceived in sin. It is well to bear this tenet in mind
as we hear of the exploits of Benjamin. Also, we must

note the four divisions of man which are described in the
literature of the cult. There is first the natural man with
evil in his blood; second, the Son of Man, with cleansed
blood ; third, the Son of God, the man without blood and
immortal; fourth, the God Man, with illuminated body
at the close of the millennium. There is here the same
preoccupation with sex to be found either in "The Bache
lor Father" or among the Buchmanites. The whole ritual
rests upon the conviction that sex is sin; death follows
sin and therefore follows sex. The House of David shows
complete unconcern for its dead. It is considered unclean
to be in a chamber when life passes out, and a corpse is
turned over immediately to an undertaker who buries it
without ceremony of any sort.
The manner in which Benjamin was regarded by his
followers came into dispute during the trial of 1927. The
state claimed that Benjamin pretended to be the Younger
Brother of Christ, the angel Gabriel, the Son of Man, and
various other characters denoting his blood or bloodless
kinship with deity. To this contention Judge Fead's de
cision gives credence, and he cites certain passages from
the sacred writings which he believes can be construed
only as showing Benjamin's claims to divinity. Two of
these citations follow:
Gabriel is his name spiritually and Benjamin is his name temporally.
(I Star III)
Benjamin is called the chosen of the Father, and blessed by his elder
brother, Jesus, and is come into this visitation and out of the tribe of
Benjamin cometh the Second Child. (I Star 19)
What Benjamin said in his books is not as important
as what his followers believe in their daily lives. Several
of the witnesses testified before Judge Fead that they
thought Benjamin was God. And Ruth Wade, one of
the women whom he is alleged to have ravished, said she
felt she was entering the gates of heaven when she first
entered his presence. Others would scamper joyously to
their parents with the tidings that they had seen Brother
Benjamin. His orders were carried out explicitly, even if
they commanded perjury in gentile courts, and the whole

conduct of the colony was governed by the impulse to
safeguard him from the persecution of the outside world.
That he occupied a unique position in the colony, estab
lished a morality which transcended that of the world,
and safely got away among his followers with the be
haviour of a superman is obvious from the trial which
finally silenced his voice for ever.
It was this trial which brought the House of David
before America. It resulted from an action brought by
the Attorney General of Michigan to abate a public nui
sance which he claimed was maintained by the House of
David. It need hardly be remarked that the House had
always been unpopular with the people of Michigan. As
early as 1908 a mob, inflamed by rumours of a misconduct
on the part of Benjamin, raided the place after a mass
indignation meeting. Other investigations had been con
ducted before by both the state and the federal govern
ments, by those charged with the suppression of white
slavery, but no criminal action had resulted. Of course
the House has always been great news, and some of our
eminent journals have from time to time carried sensa
tional stories of its immoralities. The expected number
of civil suits for the recovery of property which credulous
members had given over to the communal treasury have
occurred; but nothing of a grave and definite sort took
place until the suits of Gladys and Ruth Bamford, two
former members of the colony. They began suit against
Benjamin upon the claim that he had debauched them
in girlhood, and writs of capias were granted them in the
Circuit Court of Berrien County; these writs, however,
could not be served, for Benjamin had disappeared. He
went into hiding after Christmas, 1922, avoided detection
in two raids in 1923, and was finally discovered and ar
rested in November, 1926. Two young girls were found
with him the night of his arrest, at least one of whom
the court believes to have been with him for other than
religious purposes. The state police who made the arrest
were directed to his rendezvous by Bessie Daniels, who
joined the host who accused Benjamin of statutory rape.

for hearing May 16, 1927. During the course of the trial
practically every scandal on the House of David came
out; its history —religious, commercial, social, and sex
ual—was reviewed at great length. The trial itself occu
pied fifty-one days, extending over a period of three
months. The record of the case contains 15,000 pages of
testimony from over 225 witnesses. Over 500 exhibits
were introduced and 73 depositions taken. The emi
nently clear and informing decision of the presiding
Judge, Louis H. Fead, covers over fifty columns of
closely set newspaper print.3 The upshot of the trial was
the banishment of Purnell from the cult he had founded
and dominated, an injunction prohibiting his seeing any
of the girls of the colony save under surveillance, and the
appointment of a receiver to take over its temporal af
fairs. A counter injunction was secured by the colony,
restraining the enforcement of this decision, and the ac
tion is still pending to determine whether the House of
David shall be put into the hands of an alien receiver.
But the direst results were the death of Benjamin Pur
nell less than a month after the opinion was rendered, and
the subsequent bickerings of Mary Purnell, his consort,
and W. T. Dewhirst, both of whom are apparently seek
ing control. For the past few years Benjamin had been
in ill health ; at the trial he was a sad spectacle, testifying
feebly from his cot before the bench.
The weight of the evidence given at this trial was more
than enough to convince the Judge that Benjamin had
been guilty of sexual intercourse with loyal and hood
winked girls in the colony practically from the time of its
founding to the time of his arrest in 1926. The supposition
runs that he had first approached some of the older
women of the colony in the early years of the cult but
had been repulsed and had turned to the more impres
sionable members of the elect. Thirteen witnesses for the
state testified that they had had sexual intercourse with
Benjamin; other witnesses related specific acts of what
the court termed "indecent behaviour and familiarity";
in addition there was an accumulation of testimony to

show that Benjamin had told ribald stories to girls of his
"inner circle" and that he had a habit of fondling them.
Judge Fead pointed out in the course of his opinion that
the seventh messenger had always shown a hankering for
women and that he was for ever surrounding himself
with girls who would do his will. The night of his arrest
he was dressed only in his gym pants and the testimony
indicates that he was coming from the room of one of the
girls in the building. At Shiloh, one of the houses where
he lived from 1908 to 1915, his apartment was on the
second floor, and there were always girls on the second
and third floors. In 191 5 he moved to Benjamin's House
another of the dormitories, but Mary remained at Shiloh.
Mrs. Bamford, mother of two of the girls he is alleged
to have debauched, testified during the trial that he took
seven girls to live in his house. This testimony was not
disputed by the defence. In the Diamond House, where
he hid upon news of the Bamford charges, there was an
extra room and one of the girls, caught dishabille, went
to this room to dress following her arrest. On the occa
sion of his two other disappearances in the face of liti
gation, the testimony of the recent trial shows that he took
young girls with him. Other testimony shows that he en
gaged in sexual intercourse with one girl in the presence
of others.
His conquests seem to have been in the form of a re
ligious ceremony. Irene Pritchard, one of the thirteen
witnesses, testified that she submitted to Benjamin be
cause she had been brought up to reverence him as a
superman and thought he could do no wrong. All of the
witnesses who said they had intercourse with him allege
that he used the religious argument. It is written in The
Star:
You will be tested in many ways before you will be trusted with the
greater charge. So be watchful in whatsoever position you are chosen.
Many are, and will be accused of disobedience, as we are to be obedient
to whatsoever we are told to do; till the time appointed of the
Father; . . . You may be bidden to do things contrary to His holy
word to see if you are on the watch. Sometimes man speaks and some
times God-man; and if it is contrary to His word, it proves it is man.
All will be tested to see if they lean upon man.

THE HOUSE OF DAVID 59
When we couple this passage from the writings of
Benjamin with the fact that explicit obedience to him
was enjoined upon all, we can understand why most of
the witnesses claimed that they thought his first advances
were for the purpose of testing their faith. As Judge Fead
points out, "It would be difficult to frame a doctrine
which would more surely permit approach without of
fence and a better alibi and more graceful retreat if the
advance were resented."
Ill
Only two other conspicuous cases of unfailing devo
tion to the leader of the cult need be cited. The first is
the series of suspicious group marriages which have taken
place in the confines of the colony between the years of
1910 and 1923. The doctrine of Benjamin sets its face
solidly against sexual intercourse even between man and
wife. Total abstinence is required for achieving the "life
of the body." This enforced abstinence of course will re
main in force only until the period of immortality for
the chosen sets in—sometime within in the next seventy-
two years. But for the present the regulation is rigid and
uncompromising, and the manner in which it has been
adhered to is to be seen in the fact that only two chil
dren have been conceived and born in the colony. Two
women upon becoming pregnant have been advised by
Mary Purnell to leave. On the whole the law seems to
have been explicitly obeyed among the vast bulk of those
who accepted Benjamin Purnell as the seventh angelic
messenger who should lead the righteous into a spotless
paradise.
Without the privilege of cohabitation little incentive
remained for marriages. The conduct of young men and
women was carefully watched, and the normal motives
for courtship and marriage were obviously under the
ban. It was in view of these facts that the state inquired
meticulously into the reasons why in 1910 thirteen cou
ples were married, ten of the brides being under twenty

one years of age. Later in the same year seven other
couples were married, all of the brides being under
twenty. During 1914 twelve couples were married. In
1923 there was a single marriage and a group marriage
of six couples.
All of these unions took place under circumstances
which the court regarded as suspicious. In each instance
Benjamin Purnell was openly under the fire of scorpions,
the name given those who left the House of David and
attacked
it,
or else an investigation by state or national
authority was on foot. The conclusion which both the
press and the court reached after hearing testimony was
that the girls were forced into matrimony to shield the
seventh messenger. It would be an easy matter to lay their
loss of virtue to their husbands in the event of
a
medical
examination.
The first of these group weddings which occurred
seven years after the establishment of the colony, was ab
solutely without precedent, and was contrary to the
avowed principles of the faith. In the recent trial the
state charged that these marriages were conceived with
the single purpose of protecting Benjamin in the face of
pending investigation and, in the opinion of the Judge,
the defence offered no plausible explanation for an oc
currence so extraordinary in an ascetic colony. The cir
cumstances surrounding the incident are further dark
ened by the fact that Benjamin Purnell did not attend the
weddings. Where he was could not be determined. Some
of the witnesses said that he was around the colony, but
the most of them testified that he went to Chicago, dis
guised in
a
Mrs. Pritchard's corset and dress.
Already criticism of, Benjamin had reached such
a
height that on May
2,
1910 an affidavit was signed by
fifty-four girls and women in the colony to the effect that
they had not had intercourse with Benjamin and did not
know of any who had. This public confession of inno
cence, coupled with the group marriages and the first dis
appearance of Benjamin, constitute the first conflict of
the colony with the public morals. In reviewing the pe
riod, Judge Fead says:

THE HOUSE OF DAVID 61
Because of the practice for the first seven years of the life of the
colony, a practice consistent with and beneficial to the faith, marriage
became extraordinary, out of the beaten path, and could be accounted
for only from a radical change of policy or because conditions of a
serious nature required it. And when it first occurred in a time of grave
charges, and was later celebrated in a wholesale manner at a period
of sufficient trouble to drive Benjamin into hiding, an explanation is
imperative to avoid ugly conclusions.
Other group marriages were similarly strange, and the
court held that the defence failed to disclose any good
reasons why so many girls were practically forced into
marriage on short notice and always with scandal im
pending. The opinion of the court was that Benjamin
Purnell was guilty of "immoral conduct with a consider
able number of the girls of the colony."
These marriages brought to light another evidence of
the solidarity to be found in Benjamin's religious cult.
Not only were his commands explicitly obeyed in the
matter of marriage in violation of the tenets of the faith,
but he also issued pamphlets in the colony instructing the
people at large how to testify in the event of an investi
gation. These constituted an order of perjury, in the
opinion of the court, but need concern us only in the fact
that they set above the laws of the gentiles the laws of the
chosen. The morality within the cult was the morality of
the elect. If it came into conflict with that of the world,
it was simply unfortunate. Three witnesses testified in the
last trial that if their daughters accused Benjamin of im
morality they would not believe the charges. His disap
pearances in the face of warrants for his arrest were
thoroughly justified in the eyes of the colonists by the
analogy to the search of Herod for the child Jesus. Dur
ing his last disappearance no questions were asked; the
people went calmly about their business and accepted his
right to escape the clutches of justice. In his last days,
wasted though he was by tuberculosis and diabetes, his
zoo pounds having dwindled to 116, some of his follow
ers testified fervently that they knew with a knowledge
not of this world that he would never die. And when he
finally died he was pumped full of a non-poisonous em

balming fluid and his followers firmly expected him to
come forth from the grave on the third day.
His failure probably spells ruin for the curious cult
which he generated. At present the colony is not accept
ing any new members, nor is it gravely concerned over
the disposition that is to be made of its property. The
Lord will take care of all that. Largely because the
Seventh Angelic Messenger thought himself to be over
sexed, the past gibbers and the future glowers on the
saints at Benton Harbor, but they feel, as they have felt
all along, that the hand of God is guiding them. Their
unbending faith in the leader who corralled and dis
graced them shows as well as any other single instance in
history just what can be done by a man who uses religion
adroitly. It is the story of an ignorant broom maker of
the Kentucky wilds, a man without pretensions to learn
ing who said in his best days that education was less use
ful than dung. It is the story of a bigamist who deserted
one wife and made his second consort the high priestess
of his cult, who gathered about him more than five hun
dred devotees through his addenda to Holy Writ and the
messianic claims he propounded to other broom makers.
He established a community on the solid rock of religious
credulity and for twenty-five years maintained it success
fully in the face of derision and investigation. And during
that time he used his prophecies and his doctrine as the
means of ravishing the virgins who presided in the holy
temple of the faith. And when it was all over the vast
majority of his sanctified throng stood by him in un
wavering fidelity and expected him to overcome the last
enemy of man with a miracle of resurrection. And it all
took place in Benton Harbor, Michigan, in the Twen
tieth Century.

RUSSELLISM
i
"Millions Now Living Will Never Die J"
ANYONE who has driven along an American highway
and paid the slightest attention to the signs on telephone
poles, rocks, mountainsides, and barns along the road is
familiar with that assertion. Together with other mottoes
and Scripture references conspicuously painted hither
and yon, it has made Russellism a nationally advertised
commodity. For the International Bible Students Asso
ciation has left no stone unturned that might have a
smooth belly upon which some warning of the impending
millennium could be displayed.
During the six thousand years of the world's tragic
existence God has allowed sin to flourish for reasons ob
vious to any close student of the Bible; all the while,
however, his effort has been devoted to the selection of
the faithful few in every age. These few he intends to
make the rulers of the earth during the millennial reign
of Christ when those now alive shall be given full op
portunity for repentance and the gibbering dead shall
be summoned from the tomb to have another try at holi
ness. Christ returned invisibly in 1914 (he will never be
seen again in the flesh) and in the final Battle of Arma
geddon the devil is to be tossed into outer darkness and
perfect peace shall reign upon the earth for evermore,
save for a short period at the end of the first thousand
years when the devil is to be given another fling at man
kind; and at the end of that last round he is to be
obliterated, together with any who persists in taking up
with him. And since the great Battle of Armageddon may

64 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
commence any day now—it has already been unaccount
ably delayed for about fourteen years —it follows logi
cally that millions now living shall never die.
In its broad aspect that is the meaning of the phrase
familiar to every American. A cataclysmic event is in
the offing; after that the earth is to be brought "to a state
of Edenic paradise and made fit as a habitation for per
fect man." And once the trials are over, "man, fully re
stored to perfection, will inhabit the beautiful earth dur
ing all the ages to come." That isn't the half of it but
it suffices to show the high points of the doctrine and their
correspondence to the millennial hope that has electrified
every age since the days of Malchizedek.1 Russellism as
a body of doctrine is commonplace, but as it is expounded
and distributed by the International Bible Students, it
.takes on an extravagance at once frightful and sublime.
No other sect in modern times has so completely cap-
jtured the imagination of the unimaginative. In 1925
alone more than two million copies of Pastor Russell's
1Lactantiu3, a Latin Father affectionately called the "Christian Cicero,"
expounded in the Fourth Century A. D. a doctrine not unlike the Millennial
Dawn of the late Pastor Russell. And someone, of course, has done it regu
larly every century before or since. The account of Lactantius is based on the
Sibylline books and logically concludes that since God completed the creation
in six days, the present world will last 6,000 years; and since the first man
was created on the sixth day, the creation of the new man —the Christian
people —marks the beginning of the last age of the world. First there will
be a period of dire distress. Righteousness will diminish to a vanishing point,
•while wickedness will flourish as the green bay tree. Wars will wage through
out the earth. "There will be no faith among men, nor peace nor kindness nor
truth, and thus also there will be neither security nor government nor any rest
from evils." When 6,000 years of the world's existence have been completed,
the Son of God will descend from heaven and execute judgment upon the
wicked. He will raise the righteous dead and remain 10,000 years among them,
ruling them in justice. The faithful who are alive at his coming shall not die,
but shall continue alive throughout the millennium, producing an infinite
number of holy offspring beloved of God. They who have been raised from the
dead shall preside over the living as judges. The heathen will not be com
pletely destroyed but will be made to serve the righteous who have been
gathered within a sacred city. Here God Himself dwells. The moon will
become as bright as the sun and the latter will increase seven fold. The earth
will become miraculously fruitful; the mountains will drip with honey, wine
and milk will flow through the rivers of the earth. At the close of the Millen
nium, God will enact final Judgment, when no nation save that of God only
shall be left in the world. Then the heavens will be folded up, men changed into
the likeness of angels, and the wicked raised to receive everlasting punishment,
"burning for ever in perpetual fire in the sight of the angels and the righteous."

works were printed and the total distributed up to the
time of his death in 1916 exceeded twelve million copies.
Of one title alone, The Divine Plan of the Ages, there had
been five million copies put out, and the Students boast
for this book a circulation greater than any book in the
English language save that of the Bible. What is more,
the literature of the Association has been translated into
thirty-five languages. The books of Judge J. F. Ruther
ford, the Elisha upon whom the transforming mantle of
the Prophet fell, have already approached the ten mil
lion mark. Throughout every country and state of the
union and every province of Canada the work of the As
sociation is being sedulously carried forward. The largest
radio hook-up of 1927 was given over to broadcasting the
address of Judge Rutherford upon the sacred principles
of the order. It need hardly be added that no single heresy
—not even that of modernism —has so raised the ire of
orthodox ecclesiastics.
For the genius of this far-flung enterprise, we must
look to the late Charles Taze Russell. During the course
of his venerable ministry, he was pastor of more than
twelve hundred churches here and abroad, earning, it
seems to me, a full right to be called Pastor Russell,
though he was never ordained. These churches he visited
as God allowed, making an annual pilgrimage to Lon
don to address the brethren there. He spoke incessantly —
often six and eight hours a day—and travelled as much as
Bishop Asbury and the Apostle Paul combined. Indeed
he was fiercely bent upon a pastoral mission when over
taken by cystitis at Dallas, Texas, in 1916, and was so
earnestly set upon seeing the flocks he had promised to
see that he visited Houston, San Antonio, San Francisco
and was en route back to New York when, near the flea-
bitten Texas town of Pampa, death felled him from be
hind. Brother Menta Sturgeon, a faithful lackey who had
anxiously watched developments from the outset, saw
that death was near. Accordingly he reports that he
"finally called in the Pullman conductor and also the
porter and said, 'We want you to see how a great man of
God can die.' This sight deeply impressed them, espe

daily the porter." The Pastor then "drew up his feet in
the bed like Jacob of old" and passed away. "His droop
ing eyelids opened like the petals of a flower and dis
closed those eyes—those wonderful eyes!"
This reluctance to leave even the gruesome death of
the Pastor unadmired characterizes the whole attitude
of Russell's followers. In the Preface to Pastor Russell's
Sermons, published by his own society, we find the pub
lishers saying that he is known the world around as "the
most celebrated preacher of modern times".:
His explanatory writings on the Bible are far more extensive than
the combined writings of St. Paul, St. John, Arius, Waldo, Wycliffe,
and Martin Luther —the six messengers to the Church who preceded
him. . . . When the history of the Church of Christ is fully written,
it will be found that the place next to St. Paul in the gallery of fame
as expounder of the Gospel of the Great Master will be occupied by
CHARLES TAZE RUSSELL.
In The Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence,
the journal that Russell established as his campaign or
gan, there appeared in May, 1925, the claim that he rep
resented the angel referred to in Ezek. 9: 1-11. Pastor
Russell "is undoubtedly this same angel, or seventh mes
senger of the Church" who "filled the office fore
shadowed by the Prophet Ezekiel as represented in the
man clothed in linen with a writer's inkhorn at his side."
Curiously, this saint was at one time a scowling in
fidel. He came, like most young men of the last century,
from God-fearing parents and was in youth an earnest
worker in the Congregational Church. He received his
education from the common schools of Pittsburgh and
from private tutors, suffering all the while from the fear
of Christian torment in the after life. Evidently his
youth was dominated by morbid pictures of a sizzling
hell, for as a boy he used to go around the city of Pitts
burgh every Saturday evening and write signs with chalk
on the fences, warning people to attend Church on the
following Sabbath that they might escape the ghastly tor
ments of everlasting fire. Hell was as real to him as
Adam's rib, and the thought of it was never pleasing.
Hence, when at the age of seventeen he fell upon a doubt

ing sinner and tried to convert him to the Lord, the sinner
routed young Russell ingloriously and he, too, became
an infidel. He simply could not accept the doctrine of
eternal torment; thus he merrily threw down the whole
Christian theology and spent the next three years of his
life in studying Oriental faiths. These he found un
worthy, and after a careful and painstaking study of Holy
[Writ he came to the comforting conclusion that the Bible
did not teach the doctrine of hell. With this good news,
he began at the age of twenty a ministry which lasted,
forty-two years and cheered the hearts of hill-billies in
every nook and cranny of the democracy.
His earlier years were spent at Pittsburgh and Alle
gheny, but in 1909 he first came to New York, where he
bought Bethel Chapel at 17 Hicks Street and later rented
the Brooklyn Academy of Music for Sunday Services.
He lived to take over for his expanded work the Brook
lyn Tabernacle of Henry Ward Beecher and also to oc^
cupy the home of the sainted Beecher on Columbia
Heights. Success clothed every movement of his public
life, if his feats be judged by the severe measurements of
statistics.
There was, however, hardly a time when the Pastor
was not hopelessly involved in litigation or made the cen
tre of a stern uproar. His domestic life was far from
millennial. He declared in significant metaphor that
"many of the Lord's most faithful children live in a mat
rimonial furnace of affliction." Seventeen years of his
life were spent in the furnace. Thirteen years of the time
were to all appearances happy, though "no children
blessed the union." Then a dispute arose between the pair
and that dispute had to do with the Pastor's manner of
conducting The Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's
Presence. As Pastor Russell explained it twenty years
later, "She tried to get too much space for her writings
in our publication and we had to cut her off. That's what
made her leave me." Judge J. F. Rutherford, now head
of the various associations which Russell bequeathed, says
of the affair: "Being head of the house, Pastor Russell

his conducting his business affairs, and without notice
she voluntarily separated herself from him in 1897." For
nearly seven years, the Judge continues, she lived apart
in a house provided by him. Then in 1903 she brought
suit for separation. After five years of litigation and no
end of scandal, this divorce was granted and the court
handed down this opinion:
His course of conduct toward his wife evidences such insistent egotism
and extravagant self-praise that it would be manifest to the jury that
his conduct toward her was one of continual domination that would
necessarily render the life of any sensitive Christian woman a burden
and make her condition intolerable.
In the course of the trial evidence was offered to show
that the Pastor had been familiar with the help. This
evidence, however, strikes me as more amusing than in
criminating. In response to a direct question, Mrs. Rus
sell admitted that she did not accuse her husband of
adultery, though she testified under oath that after one
of his affairs he said to her:
I am like a jellyfish. I float around here and there. I touch this one
and that one, and if she responds, I take her to me; if not, I float on
to others.
One of his affairs was supposed to have been with
Rose Ball, who is said by the enemies of Russell to have
been "a young stenographer," and by his friends to have
been "one of the family." She was prominently men
tioned in the divorce suit, and the Brooklyn Eagle, which
has waged an arduous campaign to exterminate the
Russellites, charges that Rose married a convert and was
scurried off to Australia before she could be subpoenaed.
Judge Rutherford's explanation follows:
She came to them in 1889, a child of ten. She was treated as a member
of the family. She was an orphan. She kissed both Mr. and Mrs.
Russell goodnight each evening when she retired. They treated her
as their own child.
The Judge goes on to say that the alleged incident took
place in 1894, according to Mrs. Russell's testimony, and
that the Ball girl "could not have been more than fifteen."

He makes the further point that Mrs. Russell continued
to live with her husband for seven years before the suit
was filed. Moreover, no mention is made of Rose in the
complaint.
It was further alleged that Russell had been alone in a
room with Emily Matthews, another member of the
household, and that the door was locked at the time. To
this the Pastor replied:
Dear, you understand all about that. You know that was the room
in which the slops were emptied and the water was carried, and that
•was the morning that Emily Matthews was sick, and you told me of it
and asked me to go up and see her. And when they were running in
and out with water pails I turned the key for half a minute until I
could have a chance to hear quietly what she had to say, and there
wasn't the slightest impropriety in anything that was done. . . .
We may close the discussion of this unfortunate epi
sode with the Pastor's own affidavit of his unblemished
purity: He affirms before a notary and due witness
That I never was guilty of immorality toward any person, and
Furthermore, I have never cohabited with any person at any time and,
Further, I have never desired to do so.
Witness my hand and seal to this declaration this the a8th of Sep
tember, 1911.
Then there was the scandal of "Miracle Wheat." Over
articles published in connexion with this wheat, the Pas
tor sued the Brooklyn Eagle for a hundred thousand
dollars, albeit unsuccessfully. The charge made by the
Eagle was that the Pastor sold ordinary wheat as "Mir
acle Wheat," the retaliation of Pastor Russell was that
thirty bushels of genuine miracle wheat—the superiority
of which was duly established —was presented to the
Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and sold for a
dollar a pound in much the same way that ladies at a
church social sell atrocious pies for exorbitant prices.
Eleven witnesses at the Eagle trial testified that the wheat
was really superior, and 'the members of the Russell or
ganizations claim that the proceeds of the sale were di
rected to worthy enterprises and that nothing went to
Russell as a prerequisite.

,yp THE CONFUSION OF. JON CUES
With all the tedious hours spent in court and before
notaries, Pastor Russell found enough time to turn out
an immense amount of spiritual work. It is said that he
travelled thirty thousand miles a year making pastoral
calls; we have already noted that his written works ex
ceeded those of the other six messengers of the Church.
His editorial program was far-sighted enough, for the
Watch Tower reports shortly after his death:
Brother Russell's will provides for the continuance of the publication
of the Watch Tower, for which he left ample manuscript to insure
its publication for an indefinite period of time.
He fathered three enormous enterprises, supervised the
distribution of tracts, dictated the policies, financial and
spiritual, keeping so tight a reign on the whole enter
prise that he even arranged before his death for the seat
ing of the brethren around the table at the Home in
Brooklyn. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society
was organized in 1884 and each contributor of ten dollars
gets a share of voting stock. Toward the close of the Pas
tor's life there were two hundred thousand of these vot
ing shares, yet there had never been a vote cast against
Pastor Russell. His "Photo Drama of Creation" is said to
have been shown to more than ten million people; it
worked by means of a victrola that captured the Pastor's
voice, and the whole arrangement rather anticipated the
modern Vitaphone. Everywhere his ministry was at
tended by an enviable statistical success. In Boston, for
example, more than two thousand people, according to
the New York Times, were turned away from his last
public appearance there.
Judge Rutherford gives the following report of the
Pastor's books up to the time of his death. The numbers,
it may be said, denote distribution rather than sale :
Food for Thinking Christians 1,450,000
Tabernacle Shadows . 1,000,000
Divine Plan of the Ages 4,817,000

These publications have been translated into thirty-
five different languages. To conserve the spirited work
inaugurated by the Pastor, a Pilgrim Service was insti
tuted by the followers of Russell. They offer the follow
ing report of work done in a single year (1912) :

Miles Traveled 617,186
Towns Visited 6,672
Public Meetings 1,956
Semi-Public 3,287
Total Attendance 850,734
[These Pilgrims are definitely routed and they con
tinue to cover the country with a thoroughness hardly
credible. Brother Dunn was at Abernathy, Texas, Jan
uary 3 and 4, 1928, at Quitiqua January 8th, and at other
points in the interim. So it is throughout the United
States and Canada.

What is there in Russellism that so marvellously en
thralls the people's soul? Certainly its founder is not
sufficient explanation. Inherently, he was no more regal
and heroic than, say, Calvin Coolidge. He had his vir
tues, to be sure, but in everything he did there was some
thing just the least bit pathetic. Earth clung to him re
lentlessly. He was never admired by those who hated him.
To read intimate accounts of his daily life is to suffer
with the hero in a realistic novel ; he was piteous and de
pressing. On his last jog across the continent he lost his
valise at Kansas City because the brother in whose auto
he was taken from the station was careless in putting it
on the running board. The valise was recovered by means
of a reward announced in the Kansas City papers but
the Prophet got no word of it until he arrived at San
Antonio. His hostess in that city drew from him the com
mendation, "She hath done what she could"; then we find
her, a Sister Frost, willing "to break the alabaster box,"
and she gave the Pastor and his lackey enough money to

buy a Pullman compartment to California. As he finished
his discourse in San Antonio, a friend took several photo
graphs of him while he was resting, "which, being the
last we hope they are the best." And so on. Undoubtedly
he was photographed more times than any American,
save perhaps Mr. Coolidge. He was enshrined by means
of word and picture, but he was never more than a com
monplace little man suffering the plaudits of his kind.
The explanation lies, I think, in the savoury and agree
able theology that the Pastor preached, and in the fact
that its doctrines have been more widely and freely dis
tributed than the literature of patent medicine. Russell-
ism has spread like scandal by means of the printed word.
Long ago the three agencies promulgating its teachings
learned the value of putting these teachings in the hands
of the populace. They became past masters at the art of
economical bookmaking, with the result that I recently
bought the three latest publications of the order for
$1.1 8. These were full-size books, ranging from three
hundred to four hundred pages in length, securely and
not offensively bound, containing in one case twenty
three-colour illustrations. The seven volumes of Pastor
Russell's Studies in the Scriptures, called originally
The Millennial Dawn, can be purchased for as little as
three dollars. Really the Russellites have taken away
every impediment which might hold back a reluctant
public.
It should be noted that its theology is laid, according
to its adherents, upon the secure foundation of Holy
Writ. Russell claimed to make no departure from true
Christianity; he rather claimed to lead an erring nation
out of the wilderness and back to Bible Christianity. As
he announced in his journal, "The Watch Tower does not
assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a care
ful examination of its utterances in the light of God's
infallible word." To this infallible word the Pastor
studiously adhered. He disavowed any intent to found a
new religion, but regarded himself only as an inspired
interpreter of the Word of God as contained in the Holy
Scriptures. His utterances contain as many Scripture

references as those of J. Frank Norris, and today there is
hardly a paragraph in the writings of his followers that
in not heavily bolstered by a long citation of holy docu
ments. A book on Russellism is generally made up of
seven parts Scripture and the other three parts comment,
and the comment is plenteously sprinkled with paren
thetical references to II Pet. 3:4; Jude 8 : i ; Gen. 51-11,
and so on.
The first consoling thought that the Pastor got from his
study of the Word was in reference to hell. He catalogued
the references of the Bible to that dire region and con
cluded that it didn't exist and that its existence was never
taught by Holy Writ; further, he decided that to teach
its existence was a grave and frightful heresy.
With this conviction he began his public ministry.
His popularity with the followers of Moody and Sam
Jones can be readily imagined! We are prone to for
get the place of honour assigned to hell in the gospel
of the Nineteenth Century. Its place and importance
were more acutely realized and resonantly defended than
any doctrine of our own flippant age. It hung as an exe
cutioner's ax over the head of every sinner in every sor
did hamlet of the countryside. And though the eloquent
Bob Ingersoll had bellowed his denials from the plat
form of the local Opera House, he never quite carried
conviction, for he was an infidel who junked everything
else along with hell. Not so, Russell. Here was a teacher
come from God who announced that hell was a myth
and the Bible never taught it. There was the difference.
One man said to him, "I am glad you turned the hose
on hell and put out the fire." I am told that while lec
turing in Waco, Texas, on the non-existence of hell, a
sot rose to his feet in the back of the audience and
shouted, "Stay with 'em, Pastor! We're dependin' on
you." Obviously the idea of hell was never popular, even
to the fleshly yokel who sinned on Saturday night only.
Here was a chance to believe in Mother, Home and
Heaven, yet rid oneself of the distasteful idea of roast
ing like a fowl upon the cosmic spit of a relentless Deity.
Along with hell went belief in an immediate glory

land. The righteous will of course have their reward,
but not forthwith. The wages of sin is death, and the
doctrine of immortality, taught by the clergy in all ages,
was declared by Pastor Russell to be a monstrous fraud,
a lie which proceeded from the mouth of the Devil him
self. Thus death means obliteration for the time being
—in fact, until the resurrection at the last trump. In his
book, Talking with the Dead, Judge Rutherford says:
The conclusion of the immortality of the soul is based upon Satan's
lie and is wholly unsupported by anything else except the lie of the
Adversary. . . . Man perishes like a beast. The soul that sinneth, it
shall die.
Accompanying these assertions is a cartoon of a Chris
tian funeral in which the minister, a cadaverous chap
himself, is seen presiding over the coffin. From his lips
come these words : "Our friend is not dead. His soul is
hovering near." On the other side are the words; "Satan's
lie." The apparent practice of communicating with
spirits Judge Rutherford explains in this wise : Satan has
seduced some of the angels, causing them to become
demons, and they are the ones that now misrepresent the
dead.
Since man perishes like a beast, I was moved to find
this reference to the death of Pastor Russell :
We rejoice to know that instead of sleeping in death, as the saints
of old he is numbered among those whose "works follow him." He
has met the dear Lord in the air, whom he so loved as to lay down
his life faithfully in his service.
At first blush this is difficult to interpret. . . . On
second, it is easy. The truth is that the Lord returned
invisibly in 1914, according to Russell's own calcula
tions, and he now dwells in the air, where the Pastor
went to meet him. In the millennium the Lord and his
faithful are to be not only priests but kings.
We are already dwelling in the first stages of the mil
lennium, for the downfall of the visible world —that is
to say, its principalities and governments and churches—
was scheduled for 1914. The delay has been more or less

embarrassing to the followers of Russell, who have gra
ciously moved up the event several times and have at last
said that the real destruction is yet to come and will not
take place until "after 1926." The date was set for 1914
because "certain Scriptures" show the period of God's
kingdom being removed to be seven prophetic times of
360 years each, and a total of 2520 years. As God re
moved King Zedkiah, last of the kings of the Jews, in
606 B.C., then 1914 is the year. This explanation was
made toward the close of that year, when the outbreak
of the War in Europe happily gave credence to the Pas
tor's prophecies.
In the Watch Tower of January i, 1924, we read : "We
might expect the harvest to end fifty years after 1874 or
with the end of 1924." Or, it adds, fifty years after 1878,
or in 1928. Other clever exegeses have been attempted,
for in 1927 we find the Watch Tower saying:
Ezckiel's dumbness for a year, 5 months and 26 days might be a time
feature to be fulfilled in the dumbness of Pastor Russell in death. It is
only reasonable to make this application, because the Prophet in so many
respects pictures God's messenger to the closing age of the Church. Pas
tor Russell died October 31, 1916, and the period indicated will end
April 27, 1918.
But the end is not yet. This constipation of epochs
grows serious at times, but it never discourages the
apostles of the Pastor. They are too profoundly con
vinced of rampant sin, of its origin with a Devil more
personal than Kaiser Wilhelm, and of God's thorough
intention to abolish evil and the clergy from the face of
the earth. The scheme of it all is really too magnificent
to be upset by paltry details, and I am impelled to set
it forth at some deserving length. For this portrayal I
have followed the utterances of Judge Rutherford, who
has kindly brought the whole eschatology of the order
up to date in his book Deliverance, 1,405,000 copies of
which have been distributed. My indebtedness to him I
acknowledge only too gladly. Rutherford, by the way,
confines himself to principles and asseverations, sedu
lously avoiding such treacherous things as dates.

76 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
m
In the beginning (long before the beginning spoken
of it Genesis), God had two sons. Now these two sons
were named Logos and Lucifer. Logos seems to have
been favoured a bit from the first, but both sons were
really charming lads, being designated in the Scripture
as the Morning Stars. It seems, however, that Logos;
created Lucifer, for, since Logos obviously occupied a
"confidential relationship to Jehovah, it would there
fore be reasonable that Jehovah would speak with him
and consult with him about creation." At any rate the
two Sons of God played together in heaven long before
God had any idea of creating a world in these parts. At
last the decision was made and then the news got abroad,
Judge Rutherford remarks "the knowledge must have
greatly delighted God's heavenly creatures." It will be
remembered that "The Morning Stars sang together."
In heaven about this time there was a great multitude
of angels. There was, however, "no evidence that any
of the heavenly creatures were endowed with power to
produce any offspring." For a while everything went
well with the new enterprise. Lucifer was made gardener
and overlord of Eden and to him was delegated the
power of death. But, wretch that he was, he could not
stand the strain of responsibility. He forgot God. Selfish
ness entered his heart and he grew malignant. In his
devilish mind he plotted a gigantic scheme of rebellion
against the hosts of heaven, reasoning thus : "Adam loves
his wife. I will first induce Eve to do my bidding, and
then through her I will be able to control Adam. I will
make them eat of the tree of knowledge, then of the tree
of life and we will all defy God together."
2
God knew of this deception from the beginning, but
he did not interfere. Lucifer went forward with the
crime, resorting to "fraud, deception and lying." The
lie he told was, "There is no death," and "the emis
saries of the evil one have been telling it to the people
ever since." It seemed as though the revolt would have

been all it had set out to be, had not God suddenly real
ized the danger. God seemingly acted immediately, be
fore man had an opportunity to get to the tree of life
and eat of
it,
even before Lucifer had time to inform
man of the location of the tree.8 It
is
well known that
the two ate of the tree of knowledge, but "had Adam
eaten of the fruit of the tree of life, he could not have
been put to death even by Jehovah himself, for God can
not be inconsistent." Thus
it
was that Adam and Eve
were forfended in the nick of time and prevented from
becoming men like gods.
The question at once arises, Why did not God kill the
naughty Lucifer at the time? The answer
is
that God
wanted intelligent creatures to observe and learn the
evil effects of sin. As to the further question, Why did
not God kill man forthwith? the Judge replies: "Other
scriptures show that man had not at that time exercised
his powers to beget children."
*
Hence he permitted
Adam to remain upon the earth 930 years
;
but the im
perfect Adam could not beget perfect children, and the
dreadful state of man since his time
is
directly assign
able to him and his sin. "The very first son of Adam was
a
murderer, and Lucifer the devil induced him to com
mit the murder.
.
. . Lucifer
is
guilty of every murder
that has ever been committed on this earth."
8
Obviously this prodigal Son of God no longer stood
in good repute with the Father. In fact, he was dis
owned, his name changed to Satan, Devil, Serpent,
Dragon. "He has been defiant and arrogant and has op
posed God ever since the time of Eden. He has slandered
God's holy name and has brought reproach upon Him
and upon everyone who sought to do the Lord's will."
5
We must not think that Lucifer's rebellion stopped
with Adam and Eve. In the heavens there was
a
host of
angels without convictions whom the wily Lucifer in
cited to revolt. Between these lewd angels and the chil
dren of Adam there took place ghastly acts of wicked-

ness, for the women of earth "were beautiful in form
and fair to look upon." Moreover:
The angels saw that men and women cohabited and that children
resulted. It was the will of God that the angels remain upon the spirit
plane and should not leave their estate or life upon the spirit plane
and mingle with human beings and cohabit with women. But many
of the angels, misled and seduced by Satan the Devil, joined the re
bellion, as it is written: "And it came to pass that the sons of God
saw the daughters of God that they were fair; and they took them
wives of all they chose." •
It is clear from Gen. 6: 2, 4, 5 that giants, eventuating
from these unions, peopled the earth for years and laid
terror upon many an ancient countryside. Lucifer rea
soned that the angels and the women would breed a race
of supermen from whom he could recruit an invincible
army.
The fight was on. The mixed breed of angels and
giants was wicked beyond description. The offspring of
human and angelic beings promised to take the earth by
storm unless they were at once deterred. Lucifer was
about to induce men to believe that he was rajah of the
universe, and quite manifestly, this would never do. Thus
the flood. Noah and his family were selected because
"they were in no wise contaminated by these material
ized angels." Accordingly, he and the godly were set
afloat upon the waters and the mongrel race destroyed,
though the wicked angels were among those spared. "The
record is that they were incarcerated in prison, there
to be held until the great judgment day. Jude 6; II
Peter 2 : 4, 5."
History since the flood has been one unceasing feud
between Jehovah God and his arrogant, ingenious son,
the Devil. They have lambasted each other like a couple
of school boys, Lucifer fighting with rocks and resort
ing to every means of trickery, Jehovah waiting pa
tiently for His chance to catch His foe out by himself.
All the time the people are being tested, and the vast
majority of them are being frightfully deceived. For the
scheme which Satan has followed for a thousand years

or more is this: "To have in his system of government
an organized religion by means of which he could de
ceive the people and ridicule Jehovah God." It appears
that all members of the Christian body, save the Russell-
ites, are in the hire of the devil, for "God foreknew that
the ecclesiastical systems, Catholic and Protestant, would
be overreached by the Devil and used for his purposes."
Then Jesus came. He was merely a man, but a perfect
man, the doppleganger of Adam before the Fall. Hence
he sufficed as a ransom for all men. This displeased Satan
very much indeed. And "since Satan was maliciously
bent on killing Christ, God permitted the Devil to show
his utter depravity, and at the same time put the test to
those who would follow Satan. . . ."
Jesus was intended both as a ransom, whose shed blood
should cover every man, and as a Deliverer, who should
lead the Race to final glory. But "Jesus could not be a
Deliverer if he remained dead. It was necessary then
that he be resurrected." Jesus died a man, "But his
Father Jehovah raised him out of death a spirit being."
Then the Devil tried to prevent the resurrection, and
having failed in this he lied about it and has been lying
about it ever since.
The scene next turns to Rome, where the Devil built
a great Empire, then a still greater Church. "His world
power took on Papal Rome, having a visible representa
tion under the name and title of Pope, who claimed to
be the representative of the Lord Jesus Christ but who
was in fact the representative of the Devil; whether he
knew it or not." 7
It is the same in modern times among the potentates
of the Methodist, Baptist, and Episcopalian Churches.
All denominations form a hind quarter of the "beast."
"The ecclesiastics, to wit: popes, cardinals, bishops,
reverends, doctors of divinity, and theological profes
sors," 8
disseminate false teachings, among them "the un-
scriptural, God-dishonouring doctrine of the trinity."9

80 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
Ecclesiastics also teach "the divine right of earthly kings,
who are made by big business, to rule the people." With
reference to the clergy and the minions thereof, the fol
lowers of Russell drew up in 1926 a pronouncement of
which the following is an excerpt.
Wc, the INTERNATIONAL BIBLE STUDENTS, in conven
tion assembled, declare our unqualified allegiance to Christ, who is now
present and setting up his kingdom, and to that kingdom.
. . . unfaithful preachers have formed themselves into ecclesiastical
systems, consisting of councils, synods, presbyteries, associations, etc.,
and have designated themselves therein as popes, cardinals, bishops, doc
tors of divinity, pastors, shepherds, reverends, etc., and elected them
selves to such offices, which aggregation is therein designated as "the
clergy" ; and that these have willingly made commercial giants and pro
fessional politicians the principal ones of their flocks.
We present and charge that the clergy have yielded to the tempta
tions presented to them by Satan, and contrary to God's word, have
joined in his conspiracy, and in furtherance thereof have committed the
overt acts as follows, to wit:
Then follow the sins of the clergy; they hare "clothed
themselves in gaudy apparel, decked themselves with
jewels"; they have,
together with their co-conspirators, claimed the ability to set up God's
kingdom on earth without God, and have endorsed the League of Na
tions and declared it to be "the political expression of God's kingdom on
earth," thereby breaking their allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ
and declaring their allegiance to the Devil, the god of evil.
Comes next an arraignment of organized Christian
ity to which "Dick" Sheppard and other members of the
unholy alliance would quickly subscribe :
They have advocated and sanctified war, turned their church ed-
difices into recruiting stations, acting as recruiting officers for pay, and
preached men into the trenches, there to suffer and die.
It is further alleged that they have "kept the people
in ignorance of the Bible," "taught the false doctrine of
immortality," and that
They teach the doctrine of eternal torment . . . whereas they know
that the Bible teaches that the wages of sin is death, that hell

is a state of death or the tomb; that the dead are unconscious until the
resurrection, and that the ransom sacrifice is provided that all in due
time may have an opportunity to believe and obey the Lord and live,
while the wilfully wicked are to be punished with everlasting destruc
tion.
Things are swiftly passing from bad to worse; the
earth is honeycombed with lust and sinfulness; in the
offing is the supreme, final battle between Jehovah and
that archfiend, the Devil. The ecclesiastical wing of
Satan's organization offers the following line-up:
Roman Catholics 273,50x3,000
Orthodox Catholics 12 1,801,000
Protestants 170,900,000
In addition there are 1,017,983,000 heathen, "con
trolled by priests who worship what the apostles plainly
say is the Devil." 10
All these elements make the visible
part of Lucifer's host assembled for the great Battle of
Armageddon.
When we consider that the righteous number
scarcely 144,000, we see how greatly the odds favour
Lucifer. But let us note further that of the 144,000,
"doubtless the major portion of these have already passed
into glory." Of those remaining, "it is probable that there
are no more than 50,000, maybe less, who are faithfully
and joyfully bearing witness to God's holy name." ll
At last the hour arrives when "God will send forth
His beloved Son as Field Marshal." But I defer to the
eloquence of Judge Rutherford:
Suddenly there bursts forth a great flame of light and fire from
the right hand of the little company who are singing praises to God.
The trumpet are pealing out their terrible strains; the thunders are
rolling, the mountains are quaking and trembling, and a voice is calling
from the habitation of Zion. It is the God of heaven moving into battle.
The great and terrible day of the Lord has come !

clothed with a vesture dipped in blood." (Revelation 19:12, 13). But
behold his apparel; it is glorious, even though covered with blood. He
is treading out the winepress ; he is crushing the wicked vine of the earth.
At his approach the mountains tremble and the deep utters its terrible
voice and lifts up its hands to the heavens. The sun and the moon stand
still in their orbits, and all the stars of the high heaven are shouting
VICTORY! With righteous indignation and anger the mighty Con
queror marches through the earth to thresh the nations that have de
famed Jehovah's holy name.12
And this mighty Conqueror is the lowly Nazarene,
now become the deliverer of the righteous. "The saints
do not engage in actual combat. This is the fight of
God Almighty; and the fight is led by his beloved
Son. . . ." 18
When the rest of the slaughter is over, the
Lord will seize "the enemy himself, the Dragon, that
Old Serpent, the Devil and Satan, and bind him and cast
him in the bottomless pit that he may deceive the na
tions no more." " There he stinketh, even after the Mil
lennium is past.
Just what will be the nature of this divine catastrophe,
whether fire, earthquake, war, pestilence, the seer never
makes quite plain. He scares us into believing, how
ever, that it is to be a synthesis of all. No single calamity
would be quite ample for the wrath of God. We may
picture "all the disasters that have befallen the race dur
ing its existence, all the wars, all the earthquakes, and
cyclones and other calamities and know that none of these
will equal in woe that which will befall the world dur
ing the great Battle of Armageddon." 15
By the side of
this great fall, the siege of Jerusalem in 70 A. D. will seem
a snow-ball fight between the boys of the East and West
sides.
Already the Devil has been pitched headlong from
his exalted seat. "With the coming of Christ Jesus into
power in 1914 Satan and his demon hosts have been cast
out of heaven and onto the earth." 18

already an established fact, though as yet invisible.
Christ Jesus is in the control of that heaven, busily en
gaged in working out a staff for the conduct of his king
dom when it comes. He personally will merely direct
and will never be seen by mortal eye again. He will, how
ever, have visible representatives. And where will he get
them? They will be resurrected from the grave. Through
out the ages God has been selecting them. These men
have been kept by the Lord in the pink of condition
and will take charge of the new government when it is
formed. The names of Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham,
Sarah, Isaac, Joseph, David, Samuel, and others cited
by the Apostle Paul in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews
are the nucleus of the council of the New Jerusalem.
These ancient worthies will "be brought forth from the
tomb as perfect men, possessing perfect bodies and per
fect minds" to supervise and overlord the final resurrec
tion of the dead and the restoration of humanity to its
divine estate.
This period of restoration will embrace a period of
one thousand years. As for the order of judgment, Judge
Rutherford says: "It is reasonable to conclude that the
Lord will straighten out those who are on earth before
bringing back more with whom to be dealt." " The i ,748,-
000,000 now here —no allowances are made in this figure
for casualties in the great battle of the Lord—will be the
first ones to receive a fair trial. As these begin to be re
stored, they "will think of their beloved dead and wish
they might be brought back to life." This will mark the
beginning of the endless procession from the tomb. When
will the awakening of the dead begin? "The Scriptures
do not disclose the day, but indicate that it will not be
a great while after the living have had an opportunity
to be reconstructed." 18
During this blessed hour of resurrection, "Satan will
be incarcerated in prison so that he cannot deceive any
one. (Revelation 20: 1-3)." Then, at the end of the Mil

given another chance to spread wickedness by crafty
methods. "All who then follow Satan will be everlast
ingly destroyed, and the Devil himself shall then be de
stroyed. The Devil's system and all his works will be
for ever a stench in the nostrils of the righteous people
who survive." 19
It need hardly be said that blessings untold will fol
low hard upon the destruction of the Devil. He has
caused all blindness, poverty, disease, and unhappiness.
When he is gone the earth will blossom like the forsythia
bush. The Milky Way will be good to drink and Lyrus
will broadcast at eventide. The lowest oaf of the Thir

chained the chances should be good—will enjoy luxuries
that none but the wicked and God enjoy today.

That, in brief, is the eschatology that has captured the
minds of Russell's followers. I have quoted extensively
because I felt that no one would believe me if I put the
doctrines in my own words, and I have served the whole
of it in narrative form because it offers the movement's
psychology in its raw, unseasoned state. We have seen
that only a "remnant" of the righteous is to be present
on the earth as the Lord Jehovah God advances on the
enemy. This remnant—fifty thousand or thereabouts —
is,
strangely enough, the same in number as the present list
of subscribers to The Walch Tower and Witness of
Christ's Presence. It takes no inner light to see that the
followers of Russell are the Lord's anointed. There are
more points of similarity between Russellism and early
Christianity than any churchman would care to admit.

means to material ends. The Millennium of Pastor Rus
sell is not the ethereal Devachan of Theosophy, nor the
hampered human divinity of the New Thought. It is a
banquet of the gods in which Lazarus and his fellow beg
gars participate, having first cast their oppressors into
bottomless torment. Under the regime of Pastor Rus
sell's Christ, the folk of the Mowata, Oklahoma, Ec-
clesia will be taken to the bosom of Father Abraham and
the men who now hold mortgages on their scrawny farms
will be carrying slop to the imprisoned Lucifer.
There is something fearful and a little saddening
about it all. Here are farmers, barbers, grocers, eking out
an unwelcome life in sordid circumstances. Through cor
rect belief in the words of Holy Writ, as interpreted by
their leader, they have become the sons and daughters
of God awaiting the return of the conquering angel and
the establishment of themselves in high places. It is an
old story. They expect their irrelevant virtues to qualify
them for cosmic triumphs. They are to sit in the seats of
the mighty. What, then, does it matter if men now re
vile and persecute them?
In the terrifying description which Judge Rutherford
gives of Armageddon the apparent insignificance of the
Army of the Lord is graphically played up. The pas
tors and their flocks are shown arrayed upon one side
of the field, pointing with scorn and contempt at the
little band which prophesies the incoming of the Lord.
The visible odds are several thousand to one against the
faithful and uncompromising few. So arrogant and ex
cessive are the boasts made by the battalions of Satan that
all but the very elect of God are hoodwinked into be
lieving that the pastors and ecclesiastics and professors
of theology will win. But we have already seen how de
cisive will be the triumph of the chosen ones, for though
they are few in number and puny in battle strength, it
is God who fights for them and when the Wicked One
has been entirely routed, it is they —the insignificant band

superiors will be trodden under foot.
Meanwhile persecution abounds. The doctrines of Rus
sell, the treatment he received, and the contempt in which
his disciples are now held, have all fed the intense
paranoia which has been the unfailing mark of the move
ment from its origin. Orthodox churchmen have fallen
upon it tooth and nail, and every gash upon its body has
been taken as the fulfilment of divine prophesy. It has
regarded persecution as the hallmark of its faith, the in
evitable result of its devotion to the true precepts of the
Almighty. Hence, where it has not received mistreat
ment, it has imagined it. For Americans haven't time to
be for ever burning martyrs.
There are, to be sure, plenty of cases of actual perse
cution to feed the mills of the Russellite press. The titles
of books which have been written in opposition to its
teachings indicate the attitude of its antagonists. The
Reverend I. M. Haldeman, famous Baptist fundamental
ist and millennialist, issued in England a work entitled,
Millennial Dawnism, The Blasphemous Religion Which
Teaches the Annihilation of Jesus Christ. Another has
called his discussion Truth Triumphant or Falsehood
Stripped of Its Mask. This author concludes one of his
arguments with this petition: "Having shown clearly
the ridiculous nature of Pastor Russell's explanation, I
close by asking God to have mercy on his soul, for
Christ's sake, Amen."
Everywhere the pastor went, he met with stares and
ridicule. As a lad I remember when he came near our
town, and the saints of the community would have none
of him. I inquired the reason in my boyish innocence,
but I never got any satisfaction; I could not help feel
ing curious about any man who was so despised. In one
town in Missouri the village pastors assembled, framed
with the light company and sought to prevent the show
ing of his "Photo Drama of Creation." His works have
been burned throughout the land of the free, photo

Salem, North Carolina; Altoona and Scranton, Penn
sylvania, being proudly exhibited at headquarters. la
June, 1914, his disciples were routed by the police when
they sought to distribute pamphlets among those at
tending sunrise prayer meeting at the famous evange
listic camp at Ocean Grove, New Jersey.20 And, of
course, with their disregard for the existing governmental
systems of man, no end of Russellites got into hot water
as pacifists during the late war for democracy.
As I have said, where no actual persecution exists, it
has been imagined. And where it has been actual it has
also been imaginary. Russell has been martyred. That is
as obvious as it was necessary. His friends say he was
sneeringly referred to as a haberdasher because in his
early days he owned a chain of stores. Yet I can't see
that this damns the man; any one who calls his brother
a haberdasher is either a technician or weak on epithets.
iThe term isn't complimentary, but I don't see that it
really crucifies one.
In the literature which the cult circulates is to be found
one amazing cartoon which symbolizes the whole mar
tyr psychology of Russellism. It comprises a double-page
spread. On one side is the familiar picture of Daniel in
the Lion's Den. On the other, following the general
scheme in its entirety, is the picture of Pastor Russell
in the Scholar's Den. He is shown standing unmoved in
the centre of a library room. Rows of books are arrayed
about the wall as though they were cruel people look
ing down into an arena. On the floor on all sides of the
stern and unmoved figure of the Pastor are long-haired
scholars, shaking their shaggy manes as though they
would like nothing better than to devour the intrepid
prophet in their midst. Yet he has them hoodooed. Not
a hair upon his head is touched and they growl in vain
who seek to disconcert him.
In his pamphlet, A Great Battle in the Ecclesiastical
Heavens, the author depicts a monstrous coalition, com
prising the best minds of the Devil's camp, scheming

incessantly and staying awake nights to think of means
whereby Pastor Russell can be put out of the way. "Prot
estants, Catholics, every minister in the world has lined
up against this One Man, as the Pharisees of Old. . . .
This One Man has turned the light upon them, expos
ing them to the gaze of the people . . . The Unholy
Alliance is straining every nerve and sinew to destroy
this One Man, his influence and his work. ... It is
Papal Rome and her mongrel progeny against One Man.
. . . The fight against Martin Luther means a pigmy
compared with this one." And the Judge adds that, as
in the case of John Wesley, the wife of this One Man
has joined his persecutors.
Russellism is the religion of the consciously second-
rate. Despite all its economical printing and the efforts
of its enterprising founder, it would never have gained
so strong a hold had it not been for the underdog's su
perb sympathy with himself. I am sure that the ortho
dox hold Russell in no great esteem, but I am equally
sure that they do not spend their time plotting against
his followers. S. Parkes Cadman and the other enemies
of righteousness never think of Russellism until some
one writes a piece about the movement, and then the feel
ing must be a melange of curiosity and pity, with little
room left for the more violent emotions of the heart.
Its errors are, from the point of view of orthodoxy,
dangerous indeed. But then these selfsame errors have
brought to its disciples a feeling of importance and se
curity, and that after all is exactly what every good-
sized heresy, including Christianity, has done.

V
BUCHMANISM
Almost in secret, a strange work has been going on for the last two
or three years among the undergraduates of many universities, not only
here in England but all over the world. This work, of which the gen
eral public knows nothing at all, and of which the religious author
ities so far as I can gather have never heard, is the activity of a single
person.
THESE lines were written by the learned Harold Beg-
bie in 1922. Meanwhile the general public still knows
nothing of the movement, but the religious authorities
have become acutely aware of it. President Hibben, after
due executive investigation, has issued a bull expelling
it from the sacred halls of Princeton, the staid Episco
palians have discovered the cassocks of their own clergy
men to be infested with the plague, and one large Ameri
can community has felt the blight of its enthusiasm. The
thing is no longer secret, nor is it the work of a single
man. The labours so quietly begun by the unobtrusive
Buchman, a man "who shuns publicity of any kind" and
"nurses the shadows of privacy," has turned into a craze
of Holy Ghost evangelism which preys, not upon the
ghastly derelicts of Water Street but upon the flower
ing youth of Cambridge and fair Harvard. It threat
ened to make a Pentecost of Princeton; it has converted
Nicodemus and the Rich Young Ruler, the Rugger
iBlue and the Phi Beta Kappa.
Apart from the high astounding fact that Buchman-
ism is religion with a sex appeal, the most notable fea
ture of it is this respectable grade of convert it attracts
and the plush environment under which it works. Beg

90 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
bie says of Buchman, "I found that he was able to do,
quite quietly, rationally and unconventionally, a work
among the educated and refined which hitherto I had
chiefly associated with a more exciting propaganda di
rected to the broken earthware of our discordant civil
izations." 1
The Reverend Samuel Shoemaker, rector of
the eminently respectable Calvary Episcopal Church,
New York, and confidant of Queen Marie, is himself
a confessed and ardent champion of the Buchman cause,
which, he says, "does for educated people what the Sal
vation Army does for the down-and-out." In his recent
book, Children of the Second Birth, he cites sixteen in
stances of genuine conversion, among bankers and sell
ers of purple. It is his zeal which is today carrying the
methods of Buchman into still higher realms of society.
In its original form and as far as we are concerned with
it,
Buchmanism has to do with colleges, and its phenom
ena with the secret sins of undergraduates and semi
narians.
It
is
to Harold Begbie that we are indebted for what
little information we have of Frank N. D. Buchman.
Begbie
is
an Englishman who has spent
a
part of his life
being "A Gentleman with
a
Duster" and the rest of
it
telling yarns about men and women who were coverted
from the pleasures of sin to the graces of Christian liv
ing. His books are well known —Twice Born Men, More
Twice Born Men, and Life Changers. This last book
is
devoted entirely to the story of Buchman and the extraor
dinary cases of his university converts. The name of
Buchman
is
not mentioned in the book, for, as
I
have said,
Buchman shuns publicity. Only the initials, F. B. appear
to betray the identity of the man. In the course of Beg-
bie's observations of how men are saved, he heard of
the work which Buchman did. They struck up
a
corre
spondence and in the early part of 1922 Begbie accepted
Buchman's invitation to meet
a
number of University
men "from both sides of the Atlantic" who were to gather

at one of the now-famous Buchman house parties. At
this house party were present the flower of the manhood
of the English-speaking world, "representative of the
best hope we possess of weathering the storm of ma
terialism which so palpably threatens to overwhelm the
ship which carries the spiritual fortunes of humanity."
But even so, Begbie was not favourably impressed with
Buchman's methods. The fellow irritated him and
seemed thoroughly unimpressive. Time went on and ad
justments began to be made. Buchman worked quietly,
never openly prying but always seeking to draw the men
out. He has that happy, expectant attitude of regard
ing every man as a sinner and potential convert. In his
handbook, Soul Surgery, he warns his followers to be
ware lest any man be a wolf in sheep's clothing:
Take nothing for granted. No matter how respectable a man may
seem, be he clergyman, or vestryman, or Y.M.C.A. secretary, he may
still stand in need of your moral surgery.
It so happened, as might well be expected, that at this
very party there was a young British Army officer, "who
carried about with him, behind a charming social ap
pearance, a soul that was haunted by the torture of a
very horrible sin." Not until the last night of the party
did Buchman spot this man and call him in for a con
ference. That conference lasted until two o'clock in the
morning, but when the young officer came down to break
fast, a change had overtaken him. He explained that a
great load had been lifted and that he now had a definite
work to perform; for Buchman told the fellow that he
must go across the ocean, get a young boy whom he had
started wrong, "bring him back to England and watch
over him, and never leave him till his soul is right."
So favourably was Begbie impressed by then that he
asked Buchman's permission to write a book about him.
To this the surgeon of souls reluctantly consented, but
only upon the condition that his name not be mentioned.
Hence the book tells everything except the name, and
we must rely upon the initials "F. B." and no end of in
ternal evidence to indicate that its hero is Buchman.

92 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
His life story is almost totally devoid of interest, save
to the psychologist. When he was graduated from
theological school he deliberately sought out one of the
most unpromising corners of Gomorrah to begin his la
bours—and all for the reason that a fellow student in the
seminary had accused him of being ambitious. This he
disproved to some satisfaction, but though he did a rather
creditable statistical work, he was never happy. He was
conscious of something in himself which "prevented his
message from 'getting through.'
" In hope of surcease, he
spent one year as a missionary in the Near East, and in
1908 he paid a visit to England for the purpose of at
tending a religious gathering at Keswick. Here the mir
acle of his own conversion happened.
He entered one day a little church in Cumberland,
where seventeen people were gathered for service. A
woman conducted the service. She spoke on the Cross,
and though Buchman confesses that he cannot remember
what she said, he was aware that she "personalised the
Cross." And Begbie reports that
while he brooded on this idea in a reverie of mind, there came to him,
very palpably and with a most poignant realism, albeit with no sudden
ness, no dramatic intensity, a vision of the Crucified. He was con
scious at once of two shuddering realizations— one the realization of
a great abyss between him and the suffering Christ and the realization
of an infinite sorrow in the face of his Master.2
He experienced a "vibrant feeling up and down the
spine" as though some great store of life had suddenly
been emptied into him. Prior to this moment he had been
harbouring grudges against certain religious people j
these grudges were in his mind, fermenting, as he puts
it. Moreover, there were three sins in his heart, which
he lists under the rather general headings of selfishness,
pride, and ill will. These he dispelled immediately upon
his conversion, despatching letters of confession to six
ministers in America, against whom he held a grudge,
and in each case asking for forgiveness. From these
brethren he never received a reply.

BUCHMANISM 93
Though he was ordained into the Lutheran ministry
at the age of twenty-four, the years since his conversion
have been spent as a sort of gypsy evangelist among the
savants, going back and forth between England and
America and working among the college students in
China, Japan, and Eastern points. He began his work
when two Anglican bishops felt the need of having him
call upon their wayward sons at Cambridge. There he
found distressing conditions —as indeed he has in every
college since —and he began his conversational work. In
the universities of both England and America he car
ried on this labour quietly, until the trouble at Cam
bridge and later at Princeton brought upon him the
wrath of the Sanhedrin.
In appearance and demeanour, Buchman has been
variously described. Impressions of him vary with every
chronicler. The testimonials of his followers indicate
that he is not particularly well liked, even by those who
worship him. Begbie explains that the men stuck to Buch
man as they would to a miracle worker, "in spite of
everything that troubled either their taste or their judg
ment." Newspaper men tell us that he is a "precisely
dressed man of medium height, with sharp, searching
eyes that peer through gold-rimmed spectacles," and that
"one is conscious of a strong psychological insight in the
tenor of his remarks." An intimate writes that:
In appearance he is a youngish-looking man of middle life, tall, up
right, stoutish, clean shaven, spectacled, with that mien of scrupulous,
shampooed, and almost medical cleanness, or freshness, which is so
characteristic of the hygienic American. *
He seems constantly to exhale "the spirit of contagious
well-being." Another initiate tells us in a rather round
about way that he is corpulent and affable : "I am tempted
to think that if Mr. Pickwick had given birth to a son,
and that son had emigrated in boyhood to America, he
would have been not unlike this amiable and friendly sur
geon of souls." Still another young Englishman records:
" 'A horrid, bumptious American' was my comment

as he came into the room." And most of his follow
ers are by turns "surprised, admiring, disappointed, en
thusiastic, disgusted, afraid or scornful of this apparently
commonplace American." It is pretty well agreed that
"the impressive thing in F. B. is that a man so unimpres
sive can work miracles." And the impressive thing is
that a horrid, bumptious American has so completely
captured the hearts of the flower of manhood in the Brit
ish Isles. This seems to me far greater evidence of his
supernatural power than any spiritual operation he may
have performed on a lecherous Sophomore.
One thing we know for certain: Buchman is a mod
ern mystic. More than that, he dwells in such proximity
to divine mysteries that his actions "might even suggest
surrender to superstition." It is his unfailing habit to
awake very early from sleep and devote an hour each
morning to "complete silence of soul and body." In this
silence, Begbie tells us, "he is listening to the voice from
heaven, and the voice comes to him and he receives his
orders for the day—he is to write one man, he is to call
upon another, and so on." 4
There are many instances
given in the recital of his feats to show this quick respon
siveness to the Divine Command. One evening he was on
the way to see a man in need. Suddenly he felt himself
sharply arrested on the way, the hand of his Maker was
laid upon his shoulder, and he was told emphatically to
return to his room. He obeyed and returning found an
other young fellow who stood in even greater need of
his surgery. At times he would be directed by the Lord
to go one way from one point to another, and along the
path the Lord mapped out, there he would find some
one who needed him. He
is,
in brief,
a
sort of yogi ham
pered by
a
physical body.
He believes, too, that
a
blessing can be derived from
the reading of the Bible, and that prayer, even for ma
terial help,
is
constantly answered. His habits follow,
from almost every point of view and with the exception
of his penchant for mystical guidance, the habits of
a
normal presiding elder or consecrated Baptist profes-

sor. He hates sin as venomously as any Southern evange
list, and in his own singular way, he attacks it more fe
rociously. It would seem, on the surface, as if he was a
regular model of the classical Christian virtues.
II
Why is
it,
then, that his name
is
anathema and his
followers are pariahs? Why should the clergymen of
the Episcopal Church in New York express alarm that
iBuchmanism might become
a
powerful and dangerous
cult within their own communion? Why should Buch-
man be denied the right ever to speak at Princeton, and
why should President Hibben say, "As long as
I
am
president of the University (and
I
think
I
speak for the
whole administration), there
is
no place for Buchman-
ism in Princeton"? What
is
there about this apparently
commonplace American and his principles of personal
evangelism to stir up an ecumenical rumpus?
At least part of the answer lies in the direction of cer
tain house parties and the odours of scandal which they
have exuded. These parties form the holy of holies of
the cult of Buchmanism. And Buchman, shampooed and
ordinary as he may be,
is
the priest who presides upon
the sacred mysteries. The term "house party" has of
course always conveyed to the American mind thoughts
of adultery and godlessness, of furtive sin in all its hor
ror. Hence to use
it
in connexion with religion service
is
to offer the public more of an opportunity than
it
ever
needs. During the fall of 1926
a
crowd of seventy heaven-
bent college men and women fell upon the town of
Waterbury, Massachusetts and sought by expert or
ganization and the aid of the Holy Ghost to convert
that licentious place to the service of the Lord. Prior
to this devastating campaign, the details of which
I
shall
reserve until later, the seventy student missionaries
(fifty-five university boys and fifteen college girls) went
into
a
retreat at Camp Hazen, where, under the leader
ship of the Reverend Samuel Shoemaker, they sought to
"get right" before the work began. Before this retreat,

96 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
the college folk had proposed taking a crowd of young
men and women from the various churches on a house
party over Labor Day, but the suggestion somehow
proved unpopular with the Waterbury ministry. At the
official retreat, however, the sports which commonly en
liven a Buchman house party were enjoyed by all. A
young man from Princeton is said to have gotten up and
to have told of his past life and of how he made a com
plete surrender. Then, according to the Reverend Stan
ley D. Crossland, assistant pastor of the First Methodist
Church of Waterbury, who was present:
A young girl told how her life had been changed in a Buchman house
party. She told how she had gone to a house party and was indifferent
to their talk about guidance and took occasion to object to a married
woman who quite frankly told of some relation she had had with her
husband. She then told how "they got her" and the woman told many
had been led to God by relating the seemingly disagreeable story.
Next a young Southerner arose to speak. "I do not
want to say this but I am led to say it," he began, then
proceeded to confess his past in that lurid detail which
lends such pleasurable excitement to the labours which
the followers of Buchman perform for the Kingdom of
the Christ.
So it goes. And it all goes back to the methods Buch
man uses, for it is these which in turn give rise to the
charge that his house parties are orgiastic festivals of
saintly undergraduates, who, in the ecstasy of rehearsing
their sins, are guilty of intellectual fornication. For the
chief feature of Buchman's method is its insistence upon
a complete confession of sin, and the sin in most cases
turns out to be an error of one sort or another in the
matter of sex. As set forth in the movement's handbook,
Soul Surgery, the key words of the cult are Woo, Win,
Warn, but as elaborated in that same document, they are
Confidence, Confession, Conviction, Conversion, Con
servation. It is with the first three of the sacred formulae
that both followers and observers are most concerned.
Of his work in saving souls, Begbie says: "His genius,
I think, lies in thinking with intense preoccupation of
individual persons." That is hardly all, but it is the be

ginning. Before he does anything else, Buchman ex
plores the crevices of individual consciousness. That is
what is implied by the first principle —Confidence. Story
upon story is told by his converts, in which they describe
the strange desire they experienced in his presence —a
desire to tell everything ugly and base about themselves.
One man, a Rugger Blue, had gone from bad to worse
until he met F. B. At first he did not like the man, but
later began to be reconciled. They were scarcely ac
quainted when one evening F. B. "came bounding into
the room," with the simple excuse, "I knew someone was
needing me." The men began to talk. The room was filled
with the soft light of the setting sun. As they sat there
the Rugger Blue thought:
I sat looking at the cross against the sky, wondering how the devil
I was to tell this man, whom I scarcely knew, things about myself
which sickened me, disgraced me in my own eyes. Before I quite knew
what I was doing I said to him, "Well, I might as well tell you all
about it." He said, "Go on" and waited for me to continue. I knew
then, absolutely, and with a regular blaze of certainty, that he could
clean me out. 1 told him the whole trouble, everything. I had discussed
this thing often enough but I had never before confessed it."
As he confessed his sins, they departed from him. They
came out and "in coming out seemed to stay out." He felt
the first relief in years. Ordinary methods of self-reform
had been of no avail: "I'd tried athletics, I had gone in
for all sorts of exercises, cold baths, and tricks for
strengthening the will, but all in vain." It was the mar-
velously free and joyous confession in the presence of
Buchman which restored his self-respect.
For the most part a young man who goes to F. B. tells
him first his theological difficulties, which, Mr. Beg-
bie says, F. B. listens to patiently enough. Then he turns
to the young man and with keen eye and some severity
says to him: "It isn't any intellectual difficulty that is
keeping you from God. It is sin. You are a ." It
may be that the wretch is anything from a defiler of

ten the diagnosis is true, for he is now so great a master
in what he calls soul-surgery that he knows the facial
indication of almost every sin which men think they can
keep to themselves." 6
Next Buchman asks the sinner if
he is calling upon God with his whole will, and if the
boy replies that he
is,
Buchman explains that "the suf
ferer
is
trying to lie to himself, as well as to God, and
that
it
is
only disease, this secret sin, which could make
him so foolish." From that he proceeds to getting the
sin out into the open and showing
it
to its victim in all
its horrors and loathsomeness. Once this
is
done the knife
of the surgeon
is
ready to descend swiftly into vital places
and to loose the incubus from its feeding place. He
is
stern but kind
;
he hates sin and loves the sinner.
Other instances of the manner in which he inspires
confidence and confession are numerous. The English
dolt who thought of him first as "a horrid, bumptious
American" had not talked with him thirty minutes un
til he was laundering his soul before the man. Buch
man got up to go, not even having invited confession, but
the boy insisted, "I also lie. That
is,
usually. For instance,
what
I
told you five minutes ago.' 'God told me,' he
said." And when
it
was all over John Bull makes the
still further confession, "I had told him things that
I
never breathed to another."
7
Still another man felt, that
he could speak with "complete frankness and confidence
to this stranger," though his whole previous life had been
sadly tortured by the thorn of lust in his side and he really
saw no way he could rid himself of it.
Much of Buchman's busy life, so Begbie says,
is
spent
in really converting religious teachers and Christian
workers, and he has no end of grateful followers among
them. There are in every university young fellows freshly
weaned from the paps of sobriety who really don't know
what to make of their opportunities. They come, as
a
general rule, from homes where the defloration of
womanhood
is
regarded as the Swedenborgian sin against
the Holy Ghost, and they have never been quite free

from the restraints of religion until they are bundled off
to college. College to most of these young men represents
the first unhampered chance to sin, yet all the time there
hangs over their head the dire prospect of a sulphurous
eternity or the contraction of some of the diseases the
folks back home have warned them about. Restrained by
personal fear from overt acts of vice, they introvert and
have their own private adulteries without the aid of ac
complices. Most of these fellows turn in desperation to
some old head on the campus who seems pure, or more
important still, who seems to have weathered the gale of
adolescence without going insane as a result of his secret
sins. They fall a ready prey to any man or system which
promises them deliverance from the grip of their lecher
ous thoughts and libido. They are not the men who
carouse like pirates with the wanton coeds of the campus
or get sent home for obstreperous conduct during the
Junior prom. They are rather the seminarians, the vol
unteers for Christian service, the consecrated chaps who
think that if there is any greater sin than sex it is decep
tion. Reared to believe in the strictest identity between
religion and asceticism, they suddenly find themselves
sorely tempted to partake of the world, the flesh, and the
devil. Yet they are thwarted by the very positions they
occupy and the consequence, as I have said, is that they
spend half of their time turning their minds into softly
lighted brothels and the other half seeking some surcease
from their torture. It is upon this group that Buchman-
ism feeds, and for their particular needs its methods of
procedure seem rather well adapted.
I think one story of a Buchman convert will make
rather clear my explanation of this curious recrudes
cence of emotional, old-fashioned religion in the seats
of the higher learning both here and in the Mother
land.
There was once upon a time a young man who had
little in common with his father but liked his mother
well. He was one of three children and spent his boy

triennial visit of a dog and pony show. He grew to young
manhood on the milk of the Word and finally went to
Yale. There his troubles began. New Haven, he tells us,
is a monstrously wicked city and Chapel Street is the
parade ground of harlots and "adventure girls." These
flaunted their wares each evening in the faces of under
graduates, and what with the glare of lights and the
merrymaking of the godless throng, it was almost more
than he could bear. But he tells us that he somehow made
it,
though not without occasional compromise in the form
of wicked thoughts. Later he went to India, "but did
nothing to stop the appalling vice there." Upon his re
turn to America he decided to teach in the Hartford
Theological Seminary at Hartford, Connecticut. "Now
no one," he says, "is so unhappy as
a
theological stu
dent." They, too, have come from rural places and they
too, must conform to standards set by their profession.
Yet they are assailed by temptations "which make them
ashamed." The atmosphere of Hartford, and indeed of
all theological seminaries,
is
never really salubrious:
"One feels that these places are full of unuttered sin.
There
is
something furtive about them. You don't get
public drunkenness, immorality, gambling. There
is
no
visible and healthy clash of good and evil." The whole
air hangs heavy with repression and breathing and
serenity are difficult. As for the professors, there can be
little help from them, for "their only experience of re
ligion
is
a
memory."
One of our hero's fellow-students had once been
a
miner and
a
sailor. He used to write sermons for all the
boys, for he had an easy flow of language and his homi-
letic skill gave just the proper twist to scripture. One day
he said to our hero: "Shall
I
tell you what
I
am? I'm
a
damned hypocrite. I've been twice with women lately."
and Begbie tells us that P. G., as he
is
called in the narra
tive, "had the terror always before his eyes that he, too,
might fall. One night in New York he had to rush into
the streets and walk as hard as he could for miles, fear
ing that the temptation would beat him. He says,
'I
was
a
divided personality. There were two of me; no unity.

BUCHMANISM 101
I felt that I might fall ; yet I felt that nothing on earth
should make me.'
"
He was in this state of mind when F. N. D. Buchman
came to Hartford as Extension Lecturer on the subject,
"How To Deal with Other Men ; How to Get into Their
Lives." P. G.'s feeling was precisely what the feeling of
so many others had been, that here was the fellow to
whom he could tell his exciting all. He made full and
frank confession, whereupon he saw the light and the
shackle of garters dropped at once from his spirit. Later
Buchman asked him to go with him to China, and P. G.
consented, though he first went to a fellow seminarian
and confessed his secret sin —impurity. This fellow semi
narian came to life and confessed his own secret sin to
P. G. It was only then that full relief came to P. G. He
says, "I came to myself in confessing to another man;
. . . until a man confesses his sin to another man he can
never be really spiritually vital." So he went to China
with his saviour, and there, so he tells us, he continued
his good ministry of confession and, at the time of the
last report, bade fair to live happily ever afterward.8
Ill
The zeal with which collegians spread the good news
of emancipation from sin could well be imagined, if to
imagine it were necessary. Conservation will be remem
bered as the fifth cog of the Buchman machine, and con
servation means going about doing good, which is to
say, going about looking for the sin that lurks beneath
the brow of an apparently high-minded medical student
or engineer. Here Buchmanism begins to get obstreperous
and to run counter to the staid ideas of Episcopalians and
college authorities. Being a religion whose instruments
are confidence and confession, it proceeds at once to as
sign divine power to these instruments and to insist upon
the observance of its peculiar rites quite as urgently as
the Campbellites insist upon immersion or the Holy
Rollers upon the second blessing of the Holy Ghost. It

102 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
perpetuates its methods by requiring that they be ob
served as rites within the temple. The handbook which
I have referred to before has this advice to offer:
When he is certain that the need for confession exists, the soul surgeon
must be lovingly relentless in insisting that the confession be made, and
when and where it is needed. It is often the kind of drastic, spiritual
operation which alone can prevent a superficial repentance and unreal
conversion.
It is because each Buchmanite comes to regard him
self, after initiation into the mysteries, as himself a soui
surgeon of no mean parts and because he grows "lovingly
relentless" that confession has played so large a part in
the sessions of the cult. I say cult because Buchmanism
makes use of certain properties and instrumentalities. To
these it attributes miraculous and demonstrable potency.
It is distinguished from everyday evangelism by sacer
dotal methods singularly its own. Hence confession is not
an incident but a sacrament. Says the handbook:
At the final delegation meeting of his university, each man around the
large circle rose and told what the conference had meant to him. This
man rose, in his turn, and, before the room full of his fellow students,
confessed his sin and asked for their prayers that he might be saved
and kept from ever again succumbing to its power. It was one of the
most morally courageous acts I have ever witnessed, and can hardly
have been forgotten by any man there, and it proved to be the begin
ning of a life of real victory and power for this man, who is today a
very successful missionary in a foreign land.
The psychology to the individual is simple enough. He
feels the sudden release which comes from the "wash
out"; and since the thing he washes out is generally re
garded as despicable, he feels sharply enough that he
will never permit it to enter again. He makes himself,
consciously and joyously, the object of social control.
Then there follows that feeling of exemplary merit
which comes from abnegation of any sort. The Buchman
convert thus becomes a monk without a cell; he has nothn
ing to do but to minister to the needs of his fellow man.
What we have, then, is a horde of holy men loosed upon
the modern world, fired by the zeal of their own experi
ence and the profound conviction that sin is hideous.

Such a horde, as I have intimated, descended upon
the unsuspecting town of Waterbury, Massachusetts in
the fall of 1926." The four young men who led the cam
paign were from Yale, Harvard and Princeton—Yale
leading with two representatives. Two years before a
group of seminarians had been lolling about "in one of
the student's rooms in the vine-covered Lawrence Hall
of the Episcopal Theological School at Cambridge."
They were discussing the lot of the minister and all were
agreed that they wanted something more exciting than
the ordinary routine of feeding the lambs on the milk of
the Word. They had heard of the street preaching of
students in England and Scotland, and they decided to
go and do likewise. The result was a mild campaign in
the city of Fitchburg. With this victory behind them, a
similar group proposed another campaign to the minis
ters of Waterbury. The ministers agreed and raised forty-
five hundred dollars for the young evangelists, and all
was put in readiness:
The three days immediately before the campaign were
given over to spiritual wrestling in the mountains of Mas
sachusetts, where the Reverend Shoemaker refereed the
bouts. During this training season Shoemaker told the
young men and women just how they were to approach
individuals in Waterbury:
We were not to approach everyone, but just when the "guidance"
led us to a certain person. He didn't tell us how the guidance comes
except that he got it in prayer. We were to create a confidence and then
confess something out of our experience and lead the person to confes
sion of the wrongs in his or her life. The story method was the best.
Then we were to create a tension and we were to learn the art of mak
ing a person feel uneasy. We were to be willing to rip them up the
back, and he said, "I want somebody to rip me up the back." Also such
advice as: "Reniember, they (the prospects in Waterbury) are inter
ested in us as rotters. They are not interested in saints."
An interesting glossary of terms used among these
young revivalists is afforded by Mr. Crossland's report
9 1 am indebted to Ernest W. Mandeville for the facts in this account.
His admirable description of the episode appeared in The Churchman, October
9 and 23, 1926.

104 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
as transmitted by Mr. Mandeville. There must be a "mu
tual sharing" and a "wash out." Also they must take
"time out" for prayer, and return to the fray more de
termined than ever. "Guidance" referred to the mystical
aid of the Holy Ghost and "fresh fish for breakfast" in
dicated the miraculous way the Lord has of supplying
His servants with whatever they chance to need. In most
cases this last supply was made to the speakers, who gave
no thought to preparation, but waited for the Lord to
fill them, which He generally did, but, as some of the
infidels testified, with wind.
Here in the mountain fastnesses as later in the heat of
battle, the antics of these young folk were precisely those
of a band of ignorant mountaineers in the wilds of Ken
tucky. There was all the stress of the Nineteenth Cen
tury revival and all the holy passion of Dayton,
Tennessee. A condition bordering upon frenzy prevailed.
There were sudden conversions; the daughter of one
Episcopalian minister got so gloriously saved that she
stood on a soap box each evening and confessed her sins
to the populace. Some of the collegiate deaconnesses
visited the prostitutes in jail, though no confessions from
these sisters of sin were reported. In the final consecration
service, where were gathered "those who mean business,"
most astounding things are reported to have hap
pened. It was another Pentecost. The Reverend Mr. Gal-
laudet, minister of the Congregational Church, testified
that he had actually seen Jesus Christ while motoring on
the Bethany, Connecticut road. Mr. Mandeville says:
"He was so blinded that he had to stop his car and walk
into the woods with our Lord while he wept and wept.
He is now and henceforth will be, he says, a changed
man."
Mr. Mandeville also tells this one :
One of the Waterbury flapper converts with whom I talked told of
her former dislike for girls and her passion for men. "I used to go out
on the wrong kind of parties," she said, "but I was never so happy
as I am now. The boys (students) have shown me where I was wrong.
Now I know Christ and everything is different!"
"How did the boys know you were doing those things?" I asked.

"—They saw it in my eyes," she replied, "and then came to see
me often and soon he told me my eyes looked much clearer. I am so
happy."
Still another maiden reproached her minister severely
for his having failed to point the true path to her, saying
that "a stranger had come to town in the form of a young
God who has won me for Christ."
IV
It is easy to see how certain differences of opinion
might arise concerning Buchmanism. It has always hap
pened just that way. At Cambridge trouble occurred of
which the explosion at Princeton was but a reverbera
tion. Buchman has brought disturbance wherever he has
gone, and Americans, even more than the sons of dear
old England, are excited by a disturbance. One of his
most consecrated devotees reports that at Oxford "he
sat for two weeks in a room in one of the colleges, and
by the end of the stay the college was ranged sharply
apart into two camps —the pro- and anti-F. B.'s." 10
The same affair occurred at Princeton; there the
storm centered about the Philadelphian Society, an or
ganization over one hundred years old. It was Shoe
maker, a member of the Society, who brought Buch
manism to Princeton, for he returned to the University
shortly after the war, fired with Buchman's ideals
and convinced that the undergraduates of the University
were in sad need of the sex panacea. The idea caught on,
chiefly among the Seminoles, as the theological students
are called, and from those days until 1924 the spread
was epidemical. Buchman himself made only occasional
visits of inspection, which was enough to inspire Shoe
maker all that was in any way necessary.
What happened at Princeton during those years is
now a matter of tradition, and since it has never been
completely verified by investigation, is not any more cer
tain than many other events in religious history. The au
thorities and the older students, however, seem to have

io6 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
regarded the movement with indulgence, feeling that the
devotees of the cult were serious-minded young men
earnestly bent on doing good and were therefore to be
treated with kindness. The Buchmanites became ob
streperous at an early stage, however. Their practices
were, to a milder degree, those of Waterbury. They
would enter a boy's room and insist upon praying for
his immortal soul while he insisted upon studying for
an examination, for here as at Waterbury they had cer
tain hours when they took a little "time out" for prayer
and meditation. There were public confessionals and a
few house parties and on the whole the phenomena one
would expect when a group of youth goes rampant with
a desire to bring salvation to its fellows.
I am told that there was a grave invasion of privacy
in these efforts, that some of the Buchmanites were de
termined to make a spiritual survey of the institution
and went so far as to canvas the graduate college on the
state of the men's souls therein. The emphasis here, as
elsewhere, seems to have been upon the sin of private
adultery. One of the members of the movement took the
young and rather innocent daughter of a professor to a
movie one evening and during the performance did his
confessional to her, telling all of the mistakes, crimes,
and abuses of his sexual life. The daughter told her
father, and of course such incidents did not help the
Cause with the administration.
While he was on the campus in 1924, Buchman, in
fact, told President Hibben that 85 per cent, of the under
graduates at Princeton were sexually perverted or abus
ive. He might have put the figure higher on good au
thority and with perfect safety if he had read Berlanger's
Vorlesunger: "95 per cent, of young men and women
occasionally practise auto-eroticism." But President Hib
ben did not like the reflection which the figures cast upon
the fair name of Princeton, and it was this line from
Buchman which prompted his statement about Buch-
manism and led to the announcement that Buchman
would not be allowed in the future to address the stu
dents of the University.

Shortly after the affair at Waterbury the crisis came
at Princeton. It was, however, an editorial in Time, based
on the Mandeville articles, which led to the precipita
tion. At first the Princetonian scorned the threat of
malignant Buchmanism at Princeton, but when in Octo
ber, 1926, an open forum was held in which the Phila
delphian Society was discussed pro and con, the Prince
tonian said:
We feel that a certain form of Buchrnanism does exist here (not in
connection with the Philadelphian Society as an organization, if you
please, but through a part of its personnel). We know that it is not
wanted. And we hope to see it driven out.
On the 2^th of the same month a signed article ap
peared in the Princetonian asking for the resignation of
Ray Purdy and other secretaries of the Society who en
tertained Buchman on the campus against President Hib-
ben's wishes.
Then it was that a great convocation of students as
sembled to discuss "The Philadelphian Society and its
Relation to Princeton." Under this apparently harmless
topic, Buchmanism came in for a drubbing. It was
roundly denounced and the collegians agreed that if it
was actually on the campus it should be driven off at
once. It was called by the speakers a "religious cult which
appeals to religion through high emotionalism and em
phasizes sex as the greatest sin."
A ballot was taken on the points raised by the discus
sion and the results showed a heavy margin for the enemy.
In response to the question, Do you believe that Buch
manism in any form should be connected with a religious
organization in Princeton University? the vote stood:
No, 248; Yes, 95. And to the further question, Do you
believe that an undesirable Buchmanism is now prac
tised by the Philadelphian Society or any undergraduate
organization? the vote stood: Yes, 253; No, 85.
Following this meeting and in response to its voted re
quest, the Society was duly investigated. The committee
of investigation properly concluded that they could find
nothing definite to report on Buchmanism. An effort was

made to determine whether or not an offensively aggres
sive form of personal evangelism had been carried on,
whether or not the privacy of the individual had been
often invaded, whether emphasis had been laid upon a
mutual and intimate confession of sins, and whether the
employment of these methods had alienated a large part
of the undergraduate body from the activities of the
society. Nothing definite could be found, for when the
young men who had originated charges in general were
called before the committee, they offered nothing tangi
ble. The committee did say they thought it was a mis
take for Purdy to invite Buchman to Princeton without
Hibben's approval and to invite at least two students to
meet the soul surgeon without telling them whom they
were to meet.
The students were of course disappointed by this mild
report. As it now stood the society seemed to be exon
erated from Holy Roller tactics. But less than three weeks
after the committee had reported that the Society was
free from militant evangelism, Ray Foote Purdy, gradu
ate secretary, who will be remembered from Waterbury
days, dropped another bomb into the camp by declaring
that the aims of the society were identical with those of
Buchman. He said :
For whatever success there has been in Christian evangelism at Prince
ton, I personally owe more to Frank Buchman than to any other man
at present in Christian work, and whatever aims and methods have been
used at the Philadelphian Society, have been similar, as far as I know
them, to those of Mr. Buchman."
He further expressed the belief that the fight was be
ing waged not against Buchman but against Christianity
and that the whole stir was but a part of the conspiracy,
of the forces of darkness warring against the hosts of
heaven.
This was too much. The administration withdrew its
support, and Purdy, together with his associate secre
taries —among them Scoville Wishard, who aided in the
round-up at Waterbury—were forced to resign. In the

and a football star, in the person of Ernest C. Bartell
was elected to succeed Purdy and the affairs of the re
ligious body were once more restored to respectability.
The moral of the Princeton fracas, if there is any,
seems to me to lie in this direction: The college com
munity despises anything odd. The Buchmanites seem to
me no more absurd than the Shakers. They rest their
case solidly upon the fact that a vast majority of young
men are given to the practice of what evangelists call
secret sin. They feed upon the further fact that, for the
next twenty years at least, the vast majority of the sin
ners will be grateful for deliverance from their disgrace
and enjoy the disproportioned emphasis upon the sin
of sex. They are doubtless pests of the worst order. They
resemble, from all I can gather, the ministerial students
of a small denominational College, who feel called of
God to go about prying into the beliefs and practices of
their fellow men. By persecution, however mild it may
be, the tenets of the movement are hardened into dog
mas and its sentiments into holy ideals, and its leaders are
led to believe, as Purdy and Mother Ann believed, that
fight against the sect is a fight against God.
Whatever the case may be, we have in Buchmanism a
curious spectacle : a body of inspired and zealous young
men of more than moderate education going about
among their fellows in a campaign of personal righteous
ness, for the promotion of which they rely upon the meth
ods of the Eighteenth Century and the baptism of the
Holy Ghost. Apart from the psychology of the phe
nomenon, it presents all the fascinating anachronism of a
Mennonite feet-washing in the Cathedral of St. John the
Divine.

VI
THE DUKHOBORS
THOSE who regard the Dukhobors as Russian Quak
ers know nothing of the Quakers and noticeably less of
the Dukhobors. The two sects have in common certain
practices, such as a refusal to bear arms and take oaths,
but there the similarity stops. The Dukhoborsti are no
more like the Quakers in fundamentals than the Bantus
are like the Coloured Methodists. For one thing, the
Quakers are respectably Christian; the Dukhobors are
wholly unchristian and have a private array of Christs
all their own. The Quakers accept the Bible as the Word
of God ; the Dukhobors regard the account of the Virgin
Birth as a fairy tale originally told for children, and
while they admit that the Old Testament is good in part,
they insist that it has a great many foolish things in it.
And the Dukhobors, with their refusal to work horses
and cows in the labour of the farm, put the Quakers to
shame in tender-heartedness —so much so, in fact, that
Joseph Elkinton, who has written a history of the Duk
hobors from the Quaker point of view, expresses the
belief that these peculiar people of the Canadian North
west are "over-conscientious." This same man, on be
half of the Quakers of America, has spent no little effort
in Canada trying to "enlighten the people with the Word
of God." But to no avail. The Dukhobors' reply from
the Book of Life, are invariably evasive when one at
tempts to proselytize them, and lead on the whole a life
as different from that of a Quaker as the life of Asoka
was from that of Calvin Coolidge.

offer fewer chances of obvious comparison and there is
always some great difference to mark them off. They have
the same abominable habit of the Mennonites in not re
cording their proceedings and they salute no man by
the way. They have refused to answer questions, save in
recent years, and their origins are shrouded in mystery
and the inner meanings of their doctrines are never made
quite clear.
They have a venerable history, peopled with great
characters and staunch advocates and martyrs and des
pots. The story goes, according to A. Maude, who has
written about the only authentic book upon them as a
whole,1 that in early times there lived among them in
the Ukraine a stranger, by some accounts a non-com
missioned officer, who taught them, roving about from
house to house. Already the semblance of a sect had been
formed, though the earliest origins, as I say, are not easy
to determine. The leaders of the sect assert that their
teachings are derived from the three Hebrew children
in the fiery furnace, and Aurelio Palmieri, writing in the
Harvard Theological Review for January, 191 5, expres
ses the belief that these three may symbolize Kuhlman,
Nordman, Trevitinov, all early leaders who were burned
to death near the close of the Seventeenth Century and
the opening of the Eighteenth.
This conjecture is as good as any. Whatever the case,
this stranger of whom I have spoken appeared among
the Dukhobors of Ukraine, where he founded a non
conformist Russian sect. In his migratory ministry he
preached that governments were unnecessary, that all
men were equal, that the hierarchy and priesthood were
human inventions, and that the Czar and Archbishop
were just like common folks. There
is,
Maude admits,
some indication that this anonymous teacher was
a
Quaker. He presented the doctrines in articulate form
which the sect had long ago embraced and about this
nameless leader they regathered. Their name, Dukho
bors,
is
simple in origin. Like the terms of so many sects,

THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
conformist groups were the Iconobors, who refused to
believe in idols, and the Dukhobors, who, according to
the judgment of the Greek Orthodox Church, wrestled
against the Holy Ghost. The believers among the sect
accepted this name readily as expressing their best ele
ments, and transformed it into a compliment, asserting
that in fact they wrestled and fought with the Holy Ghost
instead of with the Sword.
Their first known leader was one Sylvan Kolesnikov,
who hailed, by the way, from the same province as Ma
dame Helena P. Blavatsky. He was a man of distinction
among the Dukhobors, for he could read. Moreover, he
had prudence and tact. He followed the general phi
losophy of the cult, teaching that all the externalities of
religion were of no importance. He held, along with Pas
tor Russell one hundred years later, that all men were
fallen angels, yet he insisted upon a different emphasis,
saying that they had tumbled before the foundation of
the world and were really divine inside.
It was Gregory Akovoroda who formulated the Duk-
hobor confession of faith. Gregory's father wished him
to enter holy orders, but the lad had other ideas. After
completing his education, he found, however, that pres
sure would be brought to bear upon him by the Arch
bishop of Kief, so he hit upon the ruse of losing his wits.
He spoke in an altered voice, and stammered. The holy
man of Kief let him alone, strangely enough, and the
young philosopher later went to Austria, where he met
and communed with the scholars of his day. After much
travel in European countries, he returned to Russia and
adopted the life of a vagabond. "Carrying a Hebrew
Bible and a flute, he went from village to village and city
to city, giving advice, conversation, and music." He pled
always the cause of the humble and the meek. He wore
the coarsest clothing and ate the plainest food. Before
his days were out, he became a musical composer of some
renown. He died in 1794, having made a bit more ar
ticulate that vast body of weird ideas which make up
the Dukhobor credo.

THE DUKHOBORS 113
Illarion Pobirohin, an opinionated and eloquent wool-
gatherer who loved religious discussions and early in life
doubted the words of Holy Writ. He gave the Duk-
hobors that cardinal tenet to which they have always
clung, namely, that truth lies not in books but in the
spirit of man, not in the Bible but in the Living Book.
Despite his aversion for the authority of the Bible, he
lost no time in announcing himself to be the Christ, a
fact which did not seem to startle his followers. He estab
lished a theocratic despotism, of which he himself was
the centre; then he gathered about him twelve apostles
and "Twelve Death-Bearing Angels," whose function it
was to punish all of those who lapsed into the habits of
the world after becoming Dukhobors. He insisted that
the Church which he established was infallible and that
the Greek Orthodox Church literally reeked with sin.
It was he who first assembled the Dukhobors into one
community and introduced communism among them. He
increased in confidence and self-assurance during his life,
and like all outspoken Russians of that day, Christ though
he was, landed in Siberia. Meanwhile, under Catherine
II and Paul, the sect suffered persecutions at the hands of
the local governments of Russia, and became notorious
among respectable Russians for its pacifism, its rejection
of Church authority and rites, and its disapproval of civil
government.
The man who took Pobirohin's place, Savely Kapous-
tin, is said to have been the most remarkable of all Duk-
hobor leaders. It is further rumoured that he was a son
of the Old Man. At least we know that he was at one
time in the Russian army and that he returned to take
the place left vacant by Pobirohin's banishment to Si
beria. He founded a dynasty which still persists upon
the plains of Western Canada. It was carried on under
the name of Kalmikof, for the shrewd leader of the
Dukhobors arranged for the use of this honoured Rus
sian name to escape the detection of the birth of his
son.2 He taught the transmigration of souls and that

iH THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
Christ is born again into every soul, that God dwells
and reveals himself in every believer. Following this
with a long rigmarole of pure reasoning, based upon
Christ's statement, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto
the ends of the earth," and the further assumption that
the soul of Jesus must have animated another body, Ka-
poustin persuaded the people that this same Christ Spirit
dwelt among the Dukhobors and was present now in him.
He said, "Now, as truly as heaven is above me and the
earth under my feet, I am the true Jesus Christ your
Lord."
Kapoustin was a man of imposing gait and appearance,
amazing memory and remarkable eloquence. It was
under his regime that, in 1801, the first movement of the
Dukhobors toward Milky Waters, the settlement that
they later made famous, began. Upon the assassination
of Paul and the ascension of Alexander I, conditions be
came more favourable to the Dukhobors, and by 1816
there were nine villages of these people at Milky Waters,
comprising some fourteen hundred souls —which is to
say, males. In all there were about three thousand per
sons. So remarkably did the Dukhobors get on with their
new enterprise that the government was compelled to call
a halt in the migrations, for here in the heart of Russia
was a conspicuously successful and favoured sectarian
movement in open defiance of the Czar, and practising
in the early years of the Nineteenth Century what the
Bolsheviki instituted, to the immense displeasure of the
civilized world, one hundred years later. Kapoustin, like
all the other messiahs, had his twelve apostles and his
thirty elders who supervised the business of the cult, but
always at his direction. Trade and commerce with the
outside world were discouraged, says Maude, for they
"were likely to engender covetousness or as likely to
bring intercourse with the 'Chaldeans,' whose opinions
and practices might be harmful to the chosen people."
fore, made arrangements that the boy should be officially illegitimate. For
this purpose he sent his wife back to her own family, the Kalmikofs, before
the child was born, and let the boy pass by their name. After this Kapoustin
remarried his wife. This explains how it was that the dynasty founded by
Kapoustin has borne the family name of Kalmikof."

THE DUKHOBORS 115
Thus Kapoustin, the soldier turned messiah, converted
this strange anarchistic sect into a closely knit govern
ment, a stiff and intractable monarchy with himself as
king. He taught his followers not only to refrain from
trade and commerce with the Chaldeans, but also to con
ceal adroitly their beliefs and practices from the out
siders, and never to involve their leader in any difficulty
by admitting that he dictated their actions and their
policies. The subterfuge used was a clever one, and has,
no doubt, given rise to the prevalent idea that these Duk-
hobors were an innocent and apostolic cult having much
in common with the rest of Christendom. For the Bible
began to be used as a means of explaining their actions
when the need arose. That was a perfectly good and con
vincing source to quote, and its quotations came as near
silencing inquirers as anything else that might be said.
They used it then, and they use it to this day, to give
reasons for the faith that is in them. But there is no in
dication that they appealed to it among themselves as
the ultimate or even as a minor authority of faith and
practice. Its use was only a part of the admirable scheme
of deception that they kept up, enabling them to be with
drawn from the world and yet exalted in the eyes of at
least the saintly part of the world. It was doubtless this
use of the Bible which led both Tolstoy and the English
Quakers in later years to lend such willing aid to the
pilgrims when they began their hegira across the Atlan
tic to Canada.
Another device that Kapoustin used was equally
clever: the business of the cult was conducted through
the Orphans' Home at Milky Waters. The purpose of
this home, ostensibly beneficent, was actually to form a
central administrative and financial agency for the con
duct of the colony's affairs. Through this home all the
relations with the Government were transacted, and
throughout his regal tenure, Kapoustin was known to
the government only as its manager. It was, with ap
propriate finesse, called Zion, and in its cloisters were
virgins constantly trained to sing the hymns of the Duk-
hobors.

n6 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
But of course the Dukhobors excited the interest and
curiosity of their neighbours, regardless of their use of
the Bible and the Orphans' Home. Everyone complained
of their shyness and suspicion. They held themselves to
be a "holy people, the King's anointed, and without
sin." They could read nothing but the Book of Life, yet
that was sufficient. And when a representative of the Eng
lish Bible Society called upon them and offered to dis
tribute the New Testament gratis, they refused, saying
that what was in the Bible was in them also. Throughout
their curious career, they were visited by those who
sought to enlighten them and set them right. A priest of
the Greek Orthodox Church was sent to call upon them
and administer the holy rites. But, unfortunately, the
man of God became drunk the first night in the com
munity —doubtless on bootlegged liquor, for the Duk
hobors have always been opposed to spiritous beverages.
At any rate, the priest was punished by confinement to a
monastery, and for a time the Dukhobors were un
molested by missionaries.
It was only when some of their members were ex
pelled that trouble fell upon them. Too many peasants
wanted to join, and the disgruntled saints distributed
bad tidings throughout the countryside. This was the
call for a renewal of the persecution which periodically
falls upon them, even to this day, and the result of it was
that another messiah was thrown into prison. After dili
gent efforts, the Dukhobors got Kapoustin released, and
he is declared to have died. Due report was made to the
Russian authorities that their leader had passed on and
had been securely buried. But the authorities were not
convinced. With characteristic thoroughness, they ex
humed the body and found it to be that of another man.
The corpse had a red beard, whereas Kapoustin was
clean-shaven. Maude reports that the leader lived several
years after this in one or the villages at Milky Waters.
Alexander I visited the villages in 1818, curious to
see what their practices were. He was received simply
and treated with the same naive hospitality which the
Dukhobors would have shown a tramp. His whole at

titude toward them was as beneficent as his dignity and
other subjects would allow him to be. But the local gov
ernment under whose supervision the settlement at
Milky Waters fell was not so good. The Kalmikof
brothers succeeded 'Kapoustin, and the trouble with the
government began again. These brothers were worthless
rulers, having no more authority than the prestnt King
of England. The result was that the duties devolved upon
the Elders and Apostles, who promptly set up an in
quisition, based upon the words, "Whoso denies his God
shall perish by the sword." Haxthausen, a German of
ficer who investigated the sect at this time, reports that
within a few years some four hundred people had mys
teriously disappeared. A thorough probe was begun, with
the result that many bodies were found to have been
buried alive and many others horribly executed. It was
after this series of outrages that the families were
moved from Milky Waters to the Caucasus.
There was danger that the line of messiahs would run
out with the brothers Kalmikof. But the Dukhobors sup
plied Illarion with six virgins for purposes of procrea
tion. He left two sons, upon one of whom at the age of
thirty the Dukhobors hoped the spirit of Christ would
descend like a dove. It did, and Peter Kalmikof enjoyed
a brief and earnest reign, telling his people that the Christ
spirit would pass from them when he died. But not so.
It fell, curiously enough, upon the wife of Peter, Ma
dame Loukeriya, who ruled the Dukhobors for years,
and most ably too. Upon her death came Peter Verigin,
the present ruler of the sect and the man who has estab
lished them with great executive skill on the plains and
in the mountains of Western Canada.
Like all his predecessors, Peter was a lineal descend
ant of the preceding Messiahs. It was, however, not with
out some effort that he convinced the people of this. It
was apparent upon Madame Loukeriya Kalmikof's death
that the sect could not be left without a leader, a God-
Man in their midst. The belief in the need of such a man
was so firmly entrenched in their minds that by 1886 it
was possible for Peter Verigin to advance his claims.

n8 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
The rumour was put into circulation that he was really
the son of the late Peter Kalmikof. Indeed he had been
seen hanging about Madame Loukeriya throughout the
latter part of her reign, and though he had been thought
of chiefly as a courtier, it was possible that the Madame
had been training him for service.
The movement for Peter spread. He was a handsome,
literate, and at that time, unprincipled youth. In the
interests of his campaign he went to his native village.
There his mother graciously confessed before him and
the assembled people that the boy was the son of the
King. For Peter Kalmikof had "honoured her by his
holy attentions at the time of his last visit." Upon this
confession, Mother Verigin and her husband fell at the
young man's feet and the people did likewise. Thus did
Peter Verigin come to be the leader of the most active
and earnest branch of the Dukhobors. He was married
at the time, but Maude reports that he paid little atten
tion to his wife in the presence of Madame Loukeriya —
that, indeed, the Madame died in an insane rage when
she learned that Peter had unwittingly against her will
invited his wife to meet him at a sea resort.
II
Here begins the strange chain of events that finally
led to the establishment of the Dukhobors in Canada
and laid the basis for their amazing capers there. It was
not long, of course, before Peter Verigin was sent to
Siberia. But he did not lose touch with his subjects.
Rather he kept in constant communication with them.
Among the young intellectuals of Siberia, Peter met men
of many heresies, among them Stundists, Baptists, and
Tolstoyans. He came naturally enough under sinister in
fluences there, and though he claims not to have read
Tolstoy's works, in one of his epistles he quoted verbatim
from Tolstoy's The Kingdom of God Within You. This
was in 1896. No acknowledgment was made and Peter's
name was signed to the document. It was clear, however,
that he had imbibed ideas in Siberia which were to make

articulate once more the whole doctrine of the Dukho-
bor sect.
It was in 1894-1895 that Tolstoy met three Dukho-
bors who were on their way to see Peter Verigin in Si
beria —against the instructions of the government, of
course. Tolstoy, the idealist, immediately thought he had
found the Kingdom of God. These were people after his
own heart. They worked with their hands, apparently
acknowledged no human authority, and produced more
than they consumed. Immediately the idealist swore that
the thing occurring among them was the "germinating
of that seed sown by Christ 1800 years ago: the resurrec
tion of Christ Himself."
From his prison throne, Peter Verigin issued many
edicts. He changed the name of the sect to the Christian
Community of Universal Brotherhood. He forbade mili
tary service of any kind among his followers; and he
forbade sexual intercourse and meats. How well these
edicts were obeyed, even to the point of abstinence from
intercourse, is shown by the fact that there were few
young children when the colonists reached Canada.
Then, says Maude, "marriage became an epidemic."
The party at home was split by these edicts, as was to
be expected. The majority followed Verigin's instruc
tions and became known as the Pasters. These who re
fused were called the Butchers. Among the Pasters
Verigin was regarded with superstitious reverence. Ru
mours came back from Siberia that Verigin was seated
upon a high throne in the North "with a Russian am
bassador on his right and a Chinese one on his left."
To the Pasters Verigin sent word that they were to
burn their firearms as an outward symbol of their new
faith. The Pasters obeyed, withdrew their money from
the bank and divided the money, announcing that they
were going to leave the country. The tense feeling of
a Kentucky revival prevailed among the people. Upon
the renunciation of their arms in a dramatic and defiant
way, the Cossacks set upon the Dukhoborsti and flogged
them brutally. The Governor of Tiflis called upon the
colonists, but he was poorly received, and he got no

promise of good behaviour out of them. Accordingly
it was decided that the homes of the Pasters should be
broken up, and more than four thousand of them were
distributed to surrounding provinces.
[Through the efforts of Tolstoy, whose novel Resur
rection is said to have been written to obtain funds for
the exodus, the arrangements were made for the Duk-
hobors to leave Russia. His own efforts were supple
mented by those of the English Quakers, and a com
mittee was sent to Canada to prospect for the coming
colonists. They were granted permission to leave, with
the understanding that they should pay their own fare
and that those now conscripted or in prison should work
out their terms of service before going.
A. Maude, to whom I have several times alluded, was
among those who came first, in the spring of 1898, to re
connoitre for the settlers. The consent of the Canadian
government, then on the lookout for colonists, was se
cured, with the understanding that the Dukhobors were
to be exempt from military service. The Government
specified, however, that the settlers were to do such
simple and civilized things as to supply vital statistics
and pay taxes. To such requirement the prospectors gave
ready consent, little thinking that these very items should
one day become the casus belli of that queer and at times
laughable struggle which has gone on between the harm
less Russian peasants and the government of Canada.
If we overlook the prospecting committee, which was
really unrepresentative of the Dukhobors and had little
or nothing to do with accomplishing their feat of migra
tion, the Dukhobors executed their exodus from Russia
to Canada without a Moses, working it out as best they
could, until by the winter of 1899-1000, more than seven
thousand of them were settled uncomfortably upon the
bleak plains of Saskatchewan. In 1899, two steamers, the
Lake Superior and the Lake Huron, made the trip, and
with the second came Count Sergius Tolstoy, second son
of the venerable Count.
When the peasants actually arrived their troubles be
gan. The winter was too near to admit of planting a crop,

so that they were scattered and given such romantic tasks
as working on the railroads —a job for which they were
as well suited as the Shakers would be, let us say, for run
ning a bawdy house. Conditions grew worse, but the per
severance of the saints was great, and by the year 1902
the colonists were established in communities and well
along the road toward prosperity and agricultural
munificence.
They still lacked a leader, however. The Canadian
government arranged for the release of Peter Verigin,
and news arrived in the year 1902 of his coming. The
whole population was thrown into a high tension; daily
the excitement grew, reaching at last almost revival pitch
and culminating, as we shall see in a moment, in the fa
mous pilgrimages which brought the Dukhobors into
the American limelight and left them there for years.
Immediately the Dukhobors dispatched a thousand dol
lars to five different towns through which Peter Verigin
might pass. Everywhere the greatest confusion and most
glorious expectation prevailed. Many tramped from vil
lage to village, proclaiming that the time of God's benef
icence had come. What would have happened if Verigin
had accepted the role of Deliverer which the seven thou
sand Dukhobors assigned him is difficult to say. As it was,
on his way from Siberia to Canada, the leader met Tol
stoy, and the novelist counselled discretion and modera
tion, so that Peter's actual arrival was a depressant and
not a stimulant.
Meanwhile, however, things began to happen fast.
Trouble had already begun to set in with the Canadian
government over the refusal to make the proper entry
with civil authorities of the births, marriages, and deaths
occurring within the communities and the further re
fusal to make proper land entries with the Department
of Interior. Dissatisfaction with the country and its har
vests began to manifest itself. The excitement prevail
ing and the dissatisfaction which grew daily set the stage
perfectly for the fanatical and millennial capers of the
more zealous members of the community.

wrong to make use of metals taken from the earth by the
enslaved brothers of the Dukhobors —humanity in gen
eral—and that even pins should not be used among them.
He further announced that it was all wrong to train
horses and cattle to do the work of man or to yield that
delicacy, milk. Moreover, it was wrong to till the soil,
for, obviously it spoiled the earth's appearance, and fur
thermore—and here is a most important item—there
were many countries where man can live merely by tak
ing the fruit from the trees. Then, too, the zealot pointed
out that Jesus did not work, and that he had cited the
lilies of the field as perfect examples of Christian virtue.
Immediately the community was divided into camps.
Almost sixteen hundred followed the evangelist, who
proclaimed that the time had come for an acceptance
of the divine law of life and work. The stay-at-homes
were threatened with hell-fire. Families were divided,
and the motley band went forth to meet Jesus somewhere
in the great Northwest. They hoped not only to meet
him but to be led by him to a warm country where they
could eat fruit from the trees and be free from the oner
ous task of conforming to the laws of earthly government.
They had to pray hard, says Maude, to avoid the temp
tation to work, for the habit of earnest toil was deeply in
grained in them. When all was ready, they handed their
coin over to the nearest immigration agent, who repre
sented Caesar. They turned out their cows, and handed
their sheep over to God, and to the wolves. They cast
aside their leather boots, for were they not the product of
animals? The movement grew, gathered force and en
thusiasm as it went, and recruited old men, women, and
children. Some went bare-headed. All were without food,
for the Lord would provide for his children.
Winter was approaching but the pilgrims were con
vinced that the Lord would, in consideration of them,
send two summers that year and hold the winter off un
til they had reached the glory land. On October 25,
1902, the Canadian winter set in, and the suffering among
the pilgrims became intense. Across the snowy plains of

the Northwest streamed sixteen hundred pilgrims, fer
vent, convinced, and ready to suffer. They believed the
Lord would meet them and when they did not find him
at the first village, they felt only that he had tarried to
test their faith, that he would certainly meet them at
Winnipeg. On they went, filled with faith and long
ing for deliverance.
In front of them, according to a press dispatch of the
time appearing in the New York World, was "a majestic
figure, black as Boanerges, and with a voice like a bull
of Bashan. He was barefoot. On his head was a bril
liant red handkerchief, and his body was clothed in a
long, dusty, white felt mantle, reaching almost to his
feet." Another reporter, of the Manitoba Free Press, says
of this stalking John the Baptist: "Suddenly he will stop,
with eyes glaring before him, then leap forward, clutch
ing the air with extended, groping hands, crying 'I see
Him; I see Jesus. He is coming. He is here.' The ten
sion runs through the crowd like a wave at these words,
which come periodically." The chanting of the people
"rises higher, stronger, and grows more militant as the
Spirit-Wrestlers show similar symptoms of seeing Him
who is invisible." As they press forward, "ever and anon
will arise their plaintive psalm, its weird minor cadences
rising and falling with varying strength, now swelling
higher on the breeze like martial music, and again sink
ing into a mournful dirge of sorrow."
The reporter approached John the Baptist as the cold
began to fall hard upon them. "Where are your boots?"
he asked.
"Jesus had no boots," the leader replied.
"But your feet will get cold."
"Jesus keeps my feet warm," was the patient explana
tion to this man of the world who lacked the eye of
faith.
The reporter for the New York World accompanied
the pilgrims most of one day, asking questions of them
and conversing with the leaders. As the night fell they
made their pitiful provisions for camping, hovering as
best they could under the blankets and scant clothing

which they had. Before dry oatmeal they gave their fa
vourite chant of the 8th chapter of Romans, then fell
wearily to eating. .They were all an amiable and kind-
hearted lot, even in the midst of their fanatical excite
ment. When the reporter started to leave, they asked
him to read several passages of scripture, which he did
by the light of inadequate campfires ; then before he could
leave he had to shake hands with more than two hun
dred of the brethren.
Naturally enough the police interfered before the pil
grimage had gone far. On the 28th of October, 1902,
more than a thousand women and children were sepa
rated from the rest and sent back to their villages. The
men were allowed to go on, but a heavy snow began to
fall on November 3rd, and the suffering among the six
hundred males in search of the Promised Land became
so frightful that several of them went insane and were
with difficulty restrained from slaughtering their fel
lows. Five days later, the Northwest Mounted Police
rounded up the survivors and put them in box cars
for shipment back to headquarters. But not without great
difficulty. The Dukhobors are non-resistant, which is to
say they will not attack, but they showed a superb stub
bornness on this occasion, locking their arms together
securely and for hours defying the police.
Back home there was trouble of a mild sort between
the mad and the bad Dukhobors —those who went chid
ing those who didn't—and it is possible that trouble of a
serious sort might have ensued, had it not been for the
timely arrival of Peter Verigin. He promised that noth
ing of the sort would happen again. But it did. In the
spring of 1903, another pilgrimage began, with the ad
ditional feature of the men and women taking off their
drawers as they approached any sign of life or village.
As one of the pilgrims said, "We stopped, undressed,
and advanced." This exhibition had a short life. It was
discountenanced by Peter Verigin and stopped at once
by the police. The spirit which promoted the pilgrim
ages, however, would not down. Some of the members of

was allowed to go home, tells us: "Having waited a little
while, we began to be active in God's service." By this
he meant that they "trampled down a field of corn," . . .
"that men should put their trust not in human science but
in God." Likewise they burnt a binding machine, . . .
"that our brethren should not torment animals but
should trust in God." From time to time, outbursts of
this nature continued to occur among the Dukhobors,
for their religion is too stimulating in its psychology
to produce mediocre results. The home of Peter Verigin
was burned to the ground by enthusiasts as late as 1916.
Ill
iThere are several possible explanations of the pil
grimages, all of them interesting and plausible. One is
perhaps too obvious to be mentioned. The pilgrims
started for a warm climate, a land of milk and fruit,
where they could pick their food from trees. Weary of
the harsh and exacting climate of the North, they be
lieved God would lead them to a land that would com
pensate for the exactions they had suffered. Heavens and
Promised Lands in all time have been, as a general
rule, the antipodes of the earthy lives of believers. Rocke
feller, I daresay, doesn't dream so much of streets paved
with gold as did the Southern negro who died in slavery.
These pilgrimages were the logical consummation of a
religion which promised ultimate rewards in terms of
material gain, and though the Dukhobors were not con
spicuous for their avarice, they had, as the pilgrimages
demonstrate, millennial expectations.
By far more credible and earthly is the explanation
offered by Mr. Maude. The trek began immediately
after word of Peter Verigin's arrival reached his follow
ers. Furthermore, Peter had written with little restraint
to his friends while learning heresies from Baptists,
Stundists, and Tolstoyans in Siberia, and though these
letters were addressed only to his closest friends, they
were later collected and published and circulated among
jthe Dukhobors. There they took on the sanctity and au

thority generally enjoyed by the epistles of the Apostle
Paul among the Nazarenes of the great Middle West.
For it will be recalled that Peter Verigin was held by
his followers in superstitious reverence and regarded as
one who sat upon the great throne of the North, from
whence he should return to judge the quick and the
dead. These letters had in them material which Peter
doubtless would not have circulated among his follow
ers—inflammatory material calculated, if taken literally,
to arouse the populace. One quotation will suffice. "In
order to be true followers of Christ," says Peter in one
of them, "it is chiefly necessary to go and preach the
Gospel of Truth, and one may beg bread for the body."
That is of course precisely what the pilgrims did. They
sallied out to meet the Lord, but they spent their time
denying the efficacy of earthly provisions and proclaim
ing the Gospel to those who would heed it not. Like the
Mormons and the Enthusiasts of the Middle Ages, they
took neither purse nor script. They returned, as so many
religions have done, to apostolic precedent. And, what
is more probable still, they went out to meet not Jesus
of Galilee but their own private Jesus, Peter Verigin of
Oborsk.
As we have seen, Peter Verigin met Count Tolstoy en
route to Canada, and either because of the counsel he
received or the sound common sense of the leader, his
advent was not messianic, but practical and restorative.
Whatever his followers may have thought of his holi
ness, the Canadian government soon learned that now
they dealt with a man of honesty and competence, a man
who could easily control the obstreperous band of Duk-
hobors, control them, that
is,
as far as he chose to do it.
To begin with, he condemned the pilgrimages as
fanatical. He introduced modern, improved methods and
machinery in the tilling of the soil, and by his executive
ability soon transformed the ill organized colonies into
a
compact and efficient agricultural and even manufac
turing community. His skill can never be doubted, and
his wisdom, while marred by the peculiar practices of
the sect he leads, can never be impugned. But troubles

did not vanish with his coming. The Canadian Govern
ment was incensed by the refusal of the Dukhobors to
become naturalized citizens of the country which gave
them their freedom. Surely Peter could persuade them
to do this. Not so. They had always refused, and they did
it again. They regarded themselves, as Peter made clear
to the Government, citizens of the world. They might
be here today and somewhere else tomorrow. They owed
no allegiance to government.
Then, too, there was trouble over the homestead en
tries. The colonies had dealt with the Russian govern
ment through a single man. They were communistic
and to make private entries of their property would vio
late the communal principle upon which they worked.
Peter Verigin had made entries for them en bloc, but
this did not satisfy the authorities. After a long dispute
the entries that he had made were cancelled and all of
the Dukhobors who refused to become good British sub
jects were deprived of their homes and given fifteen acres
of land for each member of the family. Some became
subjects of the King, but the most of them Peter decided
to move into British Columbia. He purchased fourteen
thousand acres of land at $650,000, a figure which evinces
the wealth which this man controlled, and moved six
thousand of the eight thousand Dukhobors to the new
land of promise.
Even here the troglodytes could not escape the exac
tions of modern society. The government asked for a care
ful registry of marriages, births, and deaths, and also
suggested rather vigorously that the offspring of the com
munity be sent to Canadian schools. Verigin told the Gov
ernment very frankly that he held their schools to be a
sinister influence, with their boy scout drills and their
studies in the pursuit of earthly gain. He dared not trust
his proteges to the ethics of Canadian teaching. As for
marriages, Peter said that "the marriage contract con
cerns no one but the two parties interested." This of
course was an outrage to the new civilization, but thor
oughly in accord with the beliefs of the Dukhobors. They
have no official ceremonies. When two want to marry

they ask the blessings of the community and live together
.until they are no longer happy. It isn't a ceremony but
an agreement, considerably in advance of the proposal
with which Judge Lindsey has succeeded in arousing the
ire and condemnation of modern America. A woman is
often a mother before she becomes a wife and divorce is
allowed for adultery, with the woman keeping all of the
children. The contracting parties must have attained the
age of puberty, and this seems to be the only requirement
save that of mutual consent. As for schools, why, they
said, Christ was never a scholar and he never recom
mended education to his followers.
According to Verigin, those who refused to obey the
Canadian laws were arrested, imprisoned, and in many
cases tortured to death. He cites one case of a man who
refused to eat meat soup and died as a result of the
injection of it into his stomach by means of an operation
in prison.3
But despite the rigid surveillance to which the peo
ple were subjected, they remained peculiar and dis
tinct. Added to their other vices, as I have indicated,
they were communistic. Verigin explains that this com
munism is based on spiritual and not upon economic
foundations. They banished the use of money from their
colonies, and money has neither moral nor purchasing
value within the community. It is controlled by Peter
iVerigin, who carries on all the transactions with the
Chaldeans, but his honesty and probity are above sus
picion. Any sums received from the outside are turned
over to the communal treasury. The communities are as
self-supporting as were those of the Shakers. Food, cloth
ing, and all the necessities are free of charge to every
one. There are no alcoholic drinks, no drug stores, no
cigar stores, no doctors, no lawyers, and no clergymen.
Those in the communities regard all living creatures as
equal brethren in the sight of God, thus duplicating what
Mrs. Besant claims to be the one thing that distinguishes
Theosophy from every other faith. Of course they eat no

meat. They are willing to obey the laws of the land when
these laws do not infringe upon the law of God. This is
not often the case.
Their religious service is simple and informal. It takes
place generally from four to six in the morning —an hour
doubtless set by the need of secrecy in worship while the
Dukhobors still lived in the land of the Czar. Occasion
ally it is held in the out of doors, or in a large house
in the community. There are no more meeting houses
than there are among the Hook-and-Eye Mennonites.
The ceremony is accompanied by the chanting of sacred
hymns and is composed rather largely of oriental bows.
Each man bows three times and kisses the man next to
him once, then all the men bow to all the women, and
the women respond with a collective bow. The women
also bow and kiss each other as the men do. Finally all
the men and all the women bow at the same time, bring
ing their foreheads to the ground in oriental fashion.
Another service is described by Maurice G. Hindus.
In the service which he saw there were no books, "no
ceremonial, no symbols other than the bread, water, and
salt, no priest and no leaders." The bread, water, and
salt reposed on a table in the centre of the room.
Stepping forth a pace in front of the table, and facing the bread
and water, they alternately took turns at reciting verses of psalms, after
which they bowed low, touching the floor with their heads. They rose,
sang a hymn, a special Dukhobor composition in long, drawn-out wailing
tones typical of a large body of peasant songs. Then followed an in
termission. The men and women relaxed, chatted, chuckled, as if they
were on a visit, and then they sang again. They were tireless singers
and each hymn seemed interminable. l
Theirs is essentially a folk religion. There are no
printed hymn books, not particularly because these de
vices are of the devil, but because their whole tradition
has come down to them by word of mouth and they re
vere these songs as others revere ballads.
Customs which have distinguished them from the rest
of the world of religious practice persist among them
with exceptional virility. Because they have withdrawn

so completely from the haunts of man, worldliness is less
a trial to them, though the solvent influence of democracy
and the temptations of modern life have of late made
serious inroads among their young men and women.
Some of the boys have taken to gin and cigarettes. When
they have, they have been properly ousted from the
colony, but who knows how many other young men have
watched them wistfully as they went? Had they settled
in Ohio and Indiana rather than in Saskatchewan and
British Columbia, the same fate might have already be

A group of strict, or let us say, Amish Dukhobors has
sprung up in recent years, dissatisfied with the growing
ease and slovenliness of habits among the old school.
iThese are called the Svobodniki, or Freedomites, and
they maintain as a regimen many of the practices which
the pilgrims instituted temporarily. They allow no
cooked food. They never shave. They have no salt, pep
per, vinegar or other condiments. About 1914 they threw
their clothes away and became free people. Clothes they
regard as the work of man, whereas the body is the work
of God. Many travellers have visited them, however,
found them fully dressed, and made the silly and civil
ized request that they strip off and pose for a picture.
Their life is normally primitive and they are encum
bered by no inhibitions. They express the radical aspect
of the Dukhoborsti. They are not educated, and why
should they be? Is God educated? They do not bury
their dead, for the soul is all and when that is gone,
there is nothing to worry about. The body may just as
well make a meal for some hungry animal as lie in the
ground and putrefy. Of animals they are uncommonly
considerate. When a band of them burned an office build
ing in one of the colonies, a building which they regarded
as the work of Satan and civilization, the marauders

and removed their nests before setting the thing on fire.
[Their homes, cellars, orchards and gardens are open
to all, says Hindus. Their intercourse with visitors is
marked by the greatest of kindness and hospitality. They
are supremely happy in what they do and free to talk of
their doctrine and the reason for the faith that is within
them. They express violent reaction against the cities of
the Western world. Some of them have even been to
Chicago, and they return home all the more endeared to
the simple, native practices and free movements of the
wilderness. They have found, for a time at least, the ideal
life.5
Every safeguard for sobriety is thrown around their
common life. They have no holidays. Such occasions,
they told Mr. Hindus, "make a man lazy and tempt him
to evil acts."
Education they believe makes a man want to live by
deception. If his wits are nimble, he does not want to
work honestly and soberly at the soil. Their treatment
of animals is all a vegetarian of the new school could
possibly wish. They would never think of killing a deer,
and in consequence these animals roam their fields and
pastures as calmly as their own cattle. Nor will they
kill rodents either. One old man remarked to a visitor
that the squirrels had become very annoying in recent
years; that they would clip apples from the trees, and
because they were not strong enough to carry these home,
would leave them on the ground to rot. The squirrels
were remonstrated and admonished. They were driven
off time and again. Yet they persisted in coming. "The
other day," said the old man, "I caught one and I was
so angry, may God forgive me, that I picked up a rod
and spanked her." He further promised the miss that
if she ever came again he would be tempted to cut off
her ears.
There is one further distinctive trait of the Dukho-
bors as a whole which needs to be emphasized. And if
there is a moral to the tale, it falls just here. The Dukho-

VII
THEOSOPHY
THEOSOPHY is as old as sin. The term itself was used
among the Neo-Platonists and has long been applied to
a system called Atma Vidya, or soul science, having its
hoary origins in India. In its distinctive modern form,
however, Theosophy owes both its genesis and vitality to
Madame Helena P. Blavatsky, a woman of cyclonic en
ergy, moderate erudition, and amazing ingenuity. In
1873 this egregious madame was instructed by spirit
messenger to go at once from Paris to New York where
two years later she founded with H. S. Olcott and W. Q.
Judge a "miracle club," which for all practical pur
poses became the Theosophical Society.
Just what happened to Madame Blavatsky before
1873 is difficult to determine, and the story, like that of
St. Peter, must be compounded of both history and tradi
tion. We get no help for her, for what occurred prior
to her manifestation she regarded as nobody's business
but her own. Writing to an Englishman whom she ini
tiated into the sacred mysteries of the East, she said of
her early life:
I am repeatedly reminded of the fact that, as a public character, a
woman, who, instead of pursuing her womanly duties, sleeping with her
husband, breeding children, wiping noses, minding her kitchen ... I
have chosen a path that has led to notoriety and fame . . . To those
hyenas who will unearth every tomb at night to get at the corpses and
devour them, I owe no explanations . . . Had I had lovers and chil
dren by the bushels, who is pure enough to throw openly and publicly
the first stone ?

134 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
Though a Russian, she was, curiously enough, not of
noble birth, though her father, Peter Hahn, traced his
descent from the noble von Hahns of Germany. Born
at Ekaterinoslav in 1831, she married General Blavatsky
at the age of seventeen and left him after three unhappy
months. Her most recent biographer has it that she mar
ried him to spite her governess who, in commenting on
Helena's furious temper, let fall the remark that even
old General Blavatsky could not be persuaded to marry
so great a shrew. In three days Helena had made the
General propose and the wedding could not be post
poned, though Helena hastily repented.2 The next
twenty-five years of her life were spent roving about
the world; in the course of her travels she touched on
Texas, Cuba, Egypt, India, and other scattered points,
freely gathering occult facts wherever they seemed avail
able. Butt tells us that she travelled a great part of the
time in men's clothing. It is certain that she visited Voo-
dooists among the Creoles in Louisiana and Indians in
Quebec. She wanted to live among the Mormons, but
their settlement in Nauvoo was destroyed just before her
arrival there, so she packed her ample self and moved
upon Mexico.
It suffices that Madame Blavatsky professed to have
penetrated, some time during the course of her hidden
years, beyond the borders of Tibet, and to have com
muned with Mahatmas there and in India. The Theo-
sophical Society was the result: ". . . the doctrines and
ethics given to the world through the Theosophical So
ciety during the 16 years immediately following its
foundation in 1875, emanated from certain Eastern
Teachers said to belong to an Occult Brotherhood liv
ing in the trans-Himalayan fastness of Tibet." 3
Madame
Blavatsky was the Word of these Teachers made flesh.
Upon Their existence and Their employment of her as
ambassador plenipotentiary the whole framework of
Theosophy is based.

Their real existence is of course debated quite as
gravely among Theosophists as the deity of Jesus among
Modernists. Mrs. Besant, who was later to become presi
dent and spokesman of the Society, declared in 1890: "If
there are no Masters, then the Theosophical Society is
an absurdity." These Masters are Christly figures and
must not for a moment be confused with earthly teach
ers; for though they are, in the phrase of Madame Bla-
vatsky, "supernormal men and not ignorant, flapdoodle
gods," their attributes are such as a layman is prone to
associate with divinity.
Theosophy, then, is not the confection of isolated in
dividuals, but, in the words of its founder, "the fruit
of the work of thousands of generations of Adept Seers."
These Adepts, Mahatmas, Masters, Members of the
Great White Brotherhood, are dispensers of the World-
Wisdom accumulated from the foundation of the cos
mos. They have, moreover, ready access to all the works
that have been written since the art of writing began;
Mrs. Besant reports the existence in a mountain gorge
of the East of volumes too numerous to be accommo
dated by the British Museum. These are merely those
to be found beneath a single hamlet of that wonder land.
Hence, when one speaks of a Mahatma, he speaks of
a man of no mean proportions. A Mahatma is defined by
Mrs. Besant as
A living man who has evolved more rapidly than the vast major
ity of the human race and has reached a stage of mental, moral, and
spiritual development which will be attained by the race in the future
only at the end of millenniums of years. . . .
*
The similarities between religions point to a single
source for all; and that source, says Mrs. Besant, "is the
brotherhood of the great White Lodge, the Hierarchy of
Adepts who watch over and guide the evolution of hu
manity." These Teachers have guarded the sacred mys
teries of the spirit and, arising, have reasserted them as
necessity arose. Jesus was such a Teacher; he lives now
"mostly in the mountains of Lebanon ; Hilarion in Egypt

—he wears a Cretan body; the Masters M. and K. H. in
Tibet, near Chigatse, both using Indian bodies; the Mas
ter Rakoczi in Hungary but travelling much. . . ." *
Just what evidence there is for the existence of these
baffling Adepts is never quite clear. Belief in their ex
istence is not compulsory, but leaders of the Society take
pains to point out that the more evangelical Theosophists
have always believed. Mrs. Besant says :
I know, by personal experiment, that the Soul exists, and that my
Soul and not my body is myself; that it can leave the body at will;
that it can, disembodied, reach and learn from living human teachers,
and bring back and impress upon the physical brain that which was
learned . . . that the great sages spoken of by H. P. Blavatsky exist;
that they wield powers and possess knowledge before which our control
of nature and knowledge of her ways is but child's play.8
In the literature of Theosophy the argument runs that
the race progresses and that Their existence is therefore
probable. There are Those who are as much higher than
the civilized man as he is than the savage. The disparities
between genius and dolt, saint and criminal, athlete and
cripple "are only reconcilable with divine justice if these
differences are merely signs of differing stages of
growth." At the apex of all human life would logically
stand the Master; thus his existence
is,
to say the very
least, inevitable. Moreover, you may ask any Indian to
day, "and
if
he has not been Westernized, he will tell
you that these men exist, that they have more and more
withdrawn from the ordinary haunts of men, and that
They are more and more difficult to discover as material
ity has made its way and spirituality has diminished."
But in all discussions of the Masters, the experience
of Madame Blavatsky
is
cited as evidence extraordinary;
her name stands for apostolic precedent. Many have ac
cused her of falsehood and double-dealing. Indeed there
has hardly been
a
time when she has not been the butt of
some accusation. Even A. P. Sinnett, whom she intro
duced to the Masters, or came so near
it
that he received
letters from Them, turned against her and published an

attack, after her death, upon her veracity. In spite of it
all, we still have to deal with the facts of her life and
her achievements, say the leaders of the Society. A
woman of little education, she gave to the world colossal
books of philosophy; it is incredible that she should have
gotten her material from any other than an esoteric
source. As her most worshipful biographer, Alice Leigh-
ton Cleather, words it :
About the middle of the Nineteenth Century the Trans-Himalayan
Masters of Wisdom began to prepare an agent through whom They
could give out to the world as much of the Light of Truth as the
cyclic law permitted at the end of the first five thousand years of the
Kali Yuga or Black Age of Indian Chronology.7
(That agent, it seems hardly necessary to add, was H. P.
Blavatsky. She was "mysteriously watched over and
guarded from earliest childhood," Mrs. Cleather con
tinues, "(she was born at the 'midnight hour' on July
30-31, 1831) . . ." 8
When the time was ripe she was
personally taught and prepared in Tibet by the Brother
hood for her mission. In 1851 she is said to have met her
Master in the flesh, though she had known him psychi
cally from childhood. He told her that He wanted her to
found a society and that she must spend some time in
Tibet.
The upshot of it was the establishment in 1875 of the
Theosophical Society in New York. In his Old Diary
Leaves, Colonel H. S. Olcott says that "the proposal of
the society sprang spontaneously out of the topic that was
under discussion, namely, "The Lost Canon of Propor
tion of the Egyptians." Mrs. Cleather denies that Ma
dame Blavatsky really founded the Society at that time
and says that the idea of Universal Brotherhood, which
was to play so large a part later, was entirely absent from
the scheme of this first organization. Madame Blavat
sky was in New York at the time, however, working on
her magnum opus, The Secret Doctrine. Later, in 1879,
she went with her colleague and pupil, Colonel Olcott, to

India, where she founded the Theosophical Society or
.Universal Brotherhood.
Whatever the case, the Society has been functioning
remarkably ever since 1875 and has been regarded by
its members as a vessel into which the spiritual force of
the Elder Brothers of the Race is being poured. In sum
ming up the achievements of the Society during the first
fifty years, C. Jinarajadasa, Vice-President, said that at
first the policy of the society was shaped entirely by ad
vice from the Masters, given either to H. P. B., as Ma
dame Blavatsky is affectionately called by her devotees,
or to Colonel Olcott. Then some members, being good
Americans, objected to oriental domination, and the af
fairs were for a time carried on without the aid of the
Masters. However, in 1887, Madame Blavatsky saw the
dire need of an esoteric basis, says Mr. Jinarajadasa, and
she founded the Esoteric School of Theosophy, receiv
ing at the same time letters from the Master K. H., in
which the Society is told to leave its esoteric matters to
H. P. B. and trust Colonel Olcott only with its exoteric
affairs."
Until her death Madame Blavatsky kept her piercing
eye on the affairs of the Society. She was a woman of
vigour, though in appearance she greatly resembled a
hogshead. The uncanny penetration of her eye is evident
in every photograph of her and is even noticeable in the
statue erected to her memory at the headquarters of the
Society in Adyar, India. She smoked incessantly, rolling
innumerable cigarettes with "exquisitely moulded fin
gers." She boasted of complete freedom from the thistle
of sex—boasted, too, that women were crazy about her.
She had an imperious will, an idiosyncratic method of
writing, and on the whole a cold and stiffening quality of
mind which was precisely what the theosophical move
ment needed to make it jell. By her enemies she was re
garded as ferocious ; by her followers everything she did

either revealed her otherworldliness or else was excused
by her manifest divinity.
To cite an instance of the latter: Mrs. Cleather, long
before she became the Madame's votary, expressed the
wish to meet her. The appointment was arranged by a
friend. Mrs. Cleather scraped together what money she
could find and went down to London to peep behind the
veil of the temple. Within a hundred yards of the house,
her companion, who had arranged the interview, heard
loud talking and remarked that "our old Lady" must be
in "one of her tempers." So she was. And though Mrs.
Cleather had come miles by appointment and at great
sacrifice, nothing would induce H. P. B. to see her;
rather she berated her companion for attempting to bring
a common hag into her presence. Mrs. Cleather remarks
that it was, as she later realized, her own unworthiness
that made H. P. B. refuse. "We were all unworthy." 10
Madame Blavatsky died, or was "recalled because we
had failed her" in 1891. This last phrase comes from
Mrs. Cleather, who believes profoundly that if the So
ciety in London had not been obstreperous and critical,
H. P. B. would have been kept alive by the Masters at
least until December 31, 1899. She was not left without
a witness, however, for in 1896 was published that most
curious piece of theosophical literature: "The Posthu
mous Memoirs of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, Dictated
from the Spirit- World, Upon the Typewriter, Independ
ent of All Human Contact, Under the supervision of
G. W. N. Yost, to bring to light the things of truth, and
to affirm the continuity of life and the eternal activity of
the soul immortal. Given to my astral friend and asso
ciate, Jos. M. Wade— H. P. B."
The avowed purpose of this monstrous work is "to ex
plain as far as I possibly can the complexity of my sol
emn, sacred, and phenomenal life." It continues:

She realizes that "the story may not suit the flapdoodle
of my contemporaneous colleagues," but she is sure that
... it may as a finality refute and discountenance the absurdities and
generalizations of such flimsy literary irritants as, for instance, Arthur
Lillie who, whatever his merits as a writer, has added nothing to the
welfare of men by such an absurd publication as his Madame Blavatsky
and Her Theosophy, miscalled a study, when it
is,
in fact, merely spleen,
errors, and
a
confusion of dates, tending to show that the truth of re
incarnation, karma, and the reinvesture of
a
grand Llama in the esoteric
philosophy cannot at all be correct or true, because
I,
H. P. Blavatsky,
was not in India at the time
I
said
I
was.
She promises in the course of her dictated memoirs to
return to earth, saying,
My return
is
no vagary or imagining, but an Occult fact. In the
demise of Judge an opportunity has come for me to reannounce myself,
and within sixty days look for my re-embodiment among the faith
ful in the city of New York.
I
had thought, of course, that these posthumous
memoirs would be regarded as obviously spurious even
among theosophists, but in the most recent and authori
tative Life of H. P. B.
I
find
a
discussion of "an unique
kind of otherworldliness," in which Mr. Butt goes on
to say:
Strangely enough, the existence of this quality in Madame Blavatsky
is
confirmed
by
the Posthumous Memoirs (published by Joseph M.
Wade, p. 44), in which the spirit of Madame Blavatsky
is
reported as
remarking that "when
I
was alone, my interior life began and
I
would
wonder off in the yogi state, when hours and days even passed as a
minute of time, and in the supernal reverie
I
learned to hide myself
and live with the beings upon
a
plane of existence whom
I
found there
in inner consciousness."
Mr. Butt follows with this incredible observation, that
Although
it
is
certain that the ego known as Madame Blavatsky can
not have been responsible for the Posthumous Memoirs,
it
is
quite con
ceivable that echoes of her life caught from the astral records may be con
tained in the book and that the foregoing quotation may be one of them.11

THEOSOPHY 141
In short, anything about Madame Blavatsky may be
quite conceivable.
This ego known as Madame Blavatsky left several
books to mark her transient dwelling upon this planet.
Far and away the strongest of these is The Secret Doc
trine, which, with the elaborate writings of Mrs. Besant,
may be taken as the almanac of theosophical belief. It is
characterized by Mrs. Besant as the story of the world
from beginning to end, and of course it came from the
Masters and H. P. B. had nothing to do with it save as a
recording angel. In her introduction she makes any
critic of the work feel self-conscious :
To my judges, past and future —whether they are serious literary
critics or those howling dervishes in literature who judge a book ac
cording to the popularity or unpopularity of its author, who, hardly
glancing at its contents, fasten like lethal bacilli on the weakest points
of the body —I have nothing to say.12
Nor will she deign to notice "those crack-brained
slanderers" who hope to attract attention by throwing
discredit upon "every writer whose name is better known
than their own," and who "foam and bark at their very
shadows."
The dextrous quality of her mind is well shown in her
discussion of the position of the ape in human evolu
tion. She denies that, though she believes profoundly in
evolution, man was ever an ape as the scientists of the
day asserted. She admits that he may have been ape-like
but that "the embryo of man has no more of the ape than
it has of any other mammal, but contains in itself the
totality of all kingdoms of nature." She points out in Isis
Unveiled that the "ape is a transformation of species most
directly connected with that of the human family—a bas
tard branch engrafted on their own stock before the
final perfection of the latter." 13
The satyrs represent an
extinct race of animal men ; and it is from the unnatural
union of Lilith—"a female hairy animal of character now

unknown"—and Adam, man, that the present apes have
descended. There were no apes before men and they will
be extinct before the Seventh Race develops. Before this
Seventh Race rises upon the earth (with headquarters
probably in California), "karma will lead on the monads
of the unprogressed men of our race (the Sixth) and
lodge them in the newly evolved human forms of the thus
physiologically regenerated baboons. . . . This will take
place, of course, millions of years hence."
Certainly the epochs of theosophy, in numbers and
length, put modern geology to shame. A million millen
niums means no more to Madame Blavatsky than a thou
sand years to the Lord. The occult records tell us that the
drama of our globe has seven great acts, and seven great
continents are to form the stage upon which this drama
is to be played. And, to be sure, there are seven great
Races as the Dramatis Personae. We are of the Fifth
Race. Two have well-nigh passed away. Remnants of the
others people eastern countries and the Sixth and Seventh
are yet to come. Madame Blavatsky tells us that the
American continent will develop the Sixth subdivision
of the mighty Race, and Mrs. Besant sees in our present
immigration and assimilation, the fulfilment of prophecy.
As for the New continent for the New Race, H. P. B.
invokes this out of the depths of the Pacific. It is there
already slowly rising, fragment by fragment.14 What
extravagant things will come to pass before that continent
is fully formed, only clairvoyant theosophists can specu
late.

It should be clear from the foregoing that the credo
of theosophy
is,
to say the least, distinct. It

produced letters which he alleged were received from
the Mahatmas, asking Olcott to resign and nominating
himself as successor. For a time Olcott was cowed by the
letters, but when the issue came he refused to resign ; he
offered evidence that the letters were written by Judge.
Mrs. Besant sided with Olcott and Judge withdrew from
the Convention in Boston in 1881;, taking a majority of
American followers with him. Headquarters were later
set up by Mrs. Katherine Tingley, who succeeded Judge,
at Point Loma, California, under the name Universal
Brotherhood and Theosophical Society. Since that time
Mrs. Besant has been constantly in the ascendancy among
the bulk of Theosophists.
It was the tenth of May, 1891, that Mrs. Besant knelt
before Madame Blavatsky in London and became a mem
ber of the Theosophical Society. In so doing she "real
ized the dreams of childhood on the higher plane of in
tellectual womanhood." Before that time her life had
been stormy and unsettled. As a girl (she was born in
1847) she shared the belief in ghosts and spirits and other
occult phenomena which the Irish cherish. Her mother
saw visions, and Mrs. Besant tells of one instance in
which her mother forecast the death of a child; she said
her dead husband appeared to her and told her that he
wanted the boy, Will, with him. A few days later the boy
died.
She lived a shielded life among maiden aunts, never
taking very kindly to the orthodox religious beliefs of
her day. At times she was almost seduced by the beauty
and odour of high church services, but never quite. She
thinks of herself as a courageous woman and says "The
Roman Church, had it captured me, as it nearly did,
would have sent me on some mission of danger and sacri
fice and utilized me as a martyr." She was tormented
throughout girlhood and young womanhood by religious
doubts, though in 1866 she met a young clergyman down
from Cambridge and for a time her doubts left her. The
next year they married and were, as Mrs. Besant says,
"an ill-matched pair from the very outset." Two children
were born to her. Her religious wretchedness, for of

course her doubts returned, was accentuated by the un-
happiness of her home life, and at times she became al
most suicidal in her distress. One night in 1871 she went
so far as to think of chloroform.
As a last resort she went down to Oxford to talk with
Dr. Pusey about the frightful state of her belief. Her
account of this interview seems to me well worth further
record. The learned Doctor would not recognize the
question of the deity of Jesus as one for argument.
"You are speaking of your judge," he retorted sternly when I pre
sented this difficulty. The mere suggestion of an imperfection in the
character of Jesus made him shudder, and he checked me with raised
hand. "You are blaspheming. The very thought is a terrible sin." Would
he recommend any books that might throw light on the subject? "No,
no, you have read too much already! You must pray; you must pray."
When I urged that I could not believe without proof, I was told,
"Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed." And my
further questioning was checked by the murmur, "O my child, how
undisciplined ! how impatient I" "
Obviously she got no satisfaction from Dr. Pusey, and
some time later she left the Church service without tak
ing communion. All the neighbours thought, of course,
that she was ill, for "the idea of heresy in a minister's
wife is slow to suggest itself to the ordinary bucolic
mind." The absence from communion led to gossip, and
in 1873 tne marriage tie was broken. When her mother
was dying a few years later, she sought in vain for a di
vine in London who would administer the sacrament to
her and her mother. Finally she went in desperation to
Dean Stanley of Westminster. He came, with much
understanding, and Mrs. Besant speaks of him in the most
glowing terms.
In 1874 sne fifSt saw Charles Bradlaugh. After his
address he began passing out cards in the audience, and
as he approached her he said: "Are you Mrs. Besant?"
In commenting upon this, Mrs. Besant says :
I know that our instinctive friendliness was in very truth an out
growth of friendship in other lives, and that on that August day we
took up again that ancient tie, and we did not begin a new one. And

so in lives to come we shall meet again, and help each other as we did
in this.1*
She joined the Freethinker's Society in London and
worked with Bradlaugh on behalf of atheism until in
1889 she read A. P. Sinnett's Occult World and "added
spiritualism to my studies, experimenting privately." She
found the phenomena indubitable, but the spiritualistic
explanation of them incredible. During this stage she
finally "heard a Voice that was later to become the holi
est sound to me on earth, bidding me to take courage for
the light was near."
A fortnight passed and then W. P. Stead, editor of the
Pall Mall Gazette sent her two huge volumes, saying,
"Can you review these? My young men all fight shy of
them, but you are quite mad enough on these subjects to
make something of them." She took the books. They were
the two volumes of The Secret Doctrine, by H. P. Blavat-
sky.
When she met H. P. B. she says that she was con
scious of "a sudden leaping forth of my heart—was it
recognition? and then, I am ashamed to say, a fierce re
bellion, a fierce withdrawal, as of some wild animal when
it feels a mastering hand." From the moment she deserted
atheism and took up Theosophy she found what she had
sought from youth, and she has never deserted Madame
Blavatsky since that time, though there have been ru
mours of her apostasy. There are charges, for example,
that she has led the movement in the direction of the
Church of Rome. In connexion with this we shall study
the Liberal Catholic movement later. She has, of course,
made free use of the ideology of modern science, but
whatever the charges, the point remains that in the works
of Mrs. Besant are to be found the best expression of
theosophical doctrine.
Apart from the doctrine of the Masters, the most con
spicuous tenet of Theosophy is belief in re-embodiment.
We are all Gods in the making, to use the phrase of one
writer. Potentially Calvin Coolidge is a Mahatma, and

be a whit more ethereal and progressed than he was be
fore. There is reason to believe, the Theosophists say,
that the lamented W. Q. Judge, one of the Society's dis
tinguished founders, was the Buddhist King Asoka when
last he walked on this earth. The only difference now
between James Branch Cabell and William Hale
Thompson is a difference of development; the universe
is just, and man must go through an endless chain of in
carnations, each a trifle higher than the last, until at last
he becomes aseka—"he who has no more to learn." This
magnificent progression is accomplished by means of
repeated re-embodiments, interspersed with periods dur
ing which the soul is hovering in another realm, being
delivered of its dross by heavenly processes. Those of us
who are here now are unhappily about what we were
before, though small improvement is noticeable to the
discerning.
That is the belief. And the priests of Theosophy have
so deftly worked out the scheme that they can describe
with unfailing precision each episode in this sure-footed
progress of the soul. Obviously if the plan's to work, the
universe about us must be arranged accordingly. Thus
the theosophists proceed to create their world, a happy
arrangement of graded planes, each higher than the one
beneath
it,
onto which the spirit of man can move in its
march toward perfection. Most common mortals, and
even the exceptional ones of the race, hardly get beyond
the physical, which
is
of course the densest, in their so
journ here. The next plane above
is
the astral, into which
the spirit of man occasionally ventures
if
it
is
psychic
and active. Beyond these are enough more to make the
sacred number seven.
These two planes, the physical and the astral, are the
only ones which are at all comprehensible to laymen.
A plane, as defined by the theosophists,
is
a
region
"throughout which the spirit-matter exists, all whose
combinations are derived from

physical idea." As for the astral plane, its spirit-matter
"is more vitalized and finer" than that of the physical,
and for the most part, "the prison of the physical body
shuts us away from the astral world, the physical par
ticles being too gross to be set in motion by astral matter."
(The astral body is larger than the physical, according to
Mrs. Besant, who apparently has measured
it,
for she says
that in the case of an undeveloped man
it
extends around
the physical body for ten or twelve inches. "It floats just
over the physical body and cannot go very far from it."
In the average man it
is
still larger and during sleep
he
is
able to roam around in the astral world, "drifted
hither and thither by thought currents, while the con
sciousness
is
able to receive impressions through the astral
covering, and to change them into mental pictures." In
the spiritually minded man the astral body
is
under the
complete control of its owner.
When in
it
he leaves the physical body there
is
no break of conscious
ness; he merely shakes off the heavier vessel and is unencumbered by
its weight. He can move anywhere within the astral sphere and
is
no
longer bound by narrow terrestrial limitations.18
Thus
it
is
that Adepts and even seasoned yogis in the
East are,
it
is
claimed, able to deposit their physical
bodies wherever they choose and move about mysteriously
as astral beings. Given the fact of an astral body, any
thing
is
not surprising. And once the astral world of the-
osophy
is
understood, or accepted, re-embodiment really
seems quite simple.
One point more about the astral plane. "It
is
ever
answering to vibrations caused by thoughts, feelings, de
sires, and
is
thrown into
a
commotion by any of these."
Thoughts are entities; they have atomic reality; just as
man's words are transmitted by radio, so his ideas find,
too, their wave lengths and are disseminated in the astral
atmosphere. "Man," says Mrs. Besant, "is ever sending
out angels or devils into the world, for whose creation
he
is
responsible and for whose conduct he
is
held ac
countable." Again, "Many

mother's loving prayers go

to hover about her son in angel forms, turning him aside
from evil influence." An obvious illustration of the part
these thought-forms play is cited by reference to national
atmosphere, by which the conduct of us all is more or
less moulded. It isn't that orators harangue us or history
books lie to us ; it's simply that the thought-forms of the
super-patriots crowd in and decisively influence us. The
feeling of dread depression, to which every one of us
is at times subject, is nothing but the result of malignant
thought-forms rushing in and smothering us.
So in the process of human evolution our activity is
not confined to the sordid physical, but may take place
on the astral plane as well, to say nothing of the other
five which make up the range of the theosophical uni
verse. As we move about our daily business, selling bonds,
giving lectures, writing advertising copy, we are watched
by the Masters of the Great White Brotherhood. They
are quick to single out the promising men of the race
and are quite prepared to thrust special opportunities in
the path of anyone who shows any special aptitude in
things of the spirit. They distribute cosmic energy where
it is most needed and in general help on human evolu
tion. If one yields himself more and more to their over
tures, "the unsatisfactory and unreal nature of mundane
existence presses more and more upon the soul," and he
is brought to a probationary path, under the tutelage of a
Master, and begins the ascent toward perfection.
Once entered upon this path man becomes a chela, or
accepted disciple, of some Master. Here he must ac
quire certain qualifications, such as discrimination be
tween real and unreal matters, indifference to external
things, self-control, and intense longing for liberation
—"the yearning of the soul toward solution into deity."
Meanwhile he receives much instruction from the Mas
ter—usually imparted during the deep sleep of the body.
When the chela has achieved perfection and has really
been transmuted into divine essence, he is at once given
the chance to renounce his glorious estate and return to
earth. (All the great founders of religion have made this
sacrifice.) Hence he stands in need of a vessel in which

he may reincarnate. If he is aseka—the process is simple.
But no one can reach perfection in a single bound ; there
is dire need of repeated incarnations, and a chela, while
he is yet on the Path, must scout around for a body that
will suit his purposes. Occasionally, Mrs. Besant says, a
chela may reincarnate in a body that has passed through
infancy and extreme youth as a tabernacle of a less pro
gressed ego:
When an ego comes to earth for a very brief time-period, say fifteen
or twenty years, he will be leaving his body at the dawn of manhood,
when it is becoming an effective vehicle for the soul. If such a body be
a very good one and a chela be waiting for a suitable reincarnation, it
will often be watched during the tenenacy of the ego for whom it
was originally intended with a view to utilizing it when he is done
with it; when the life-period of that ego is completed, and he passes
into Kamaloka on his way to Devachan, his cast-off body will be taken
possession of by the waiting chela. A new tenant will enter the de
serted house, and the apparently dead body will revive. Such cases are
unusual but are not unknown to occultists.18
Devachan is the theosophical name for heaven; it
means happy or bright state; while Kamaloka, "the place
of desire," is the name given to the conditions of the inter
mediate life on the astral plane. It corresponds, to all
practical appearance, to the Catholic purgatory. For
whether we be chelas or merely brokers in the process
of becoming Mahatmas, we must, subsequent to each
earthly existence, pass through Kamaloka. In that realm
the departed spirit dwells, awaiting reincarnation. The
ego's experience there will be determined by his conduct
in the life just ended. Here Kamaloka approaches the
Christian hell, though there is of course no punishment
—merely the inevitable operation of causes set going by
the ego throughout his physical existence. The spiritually
minded will pass through with phantom swiftness, the
good will lumber through, but the bad will have one
hell of a time and be acutely conscious while they are
having it. There is no fire, but Kamaloka lacks no other
property of torture. Mrs. Besant's portrayal of the agony
in Kamaloka makes Jonathan Edwards's fire and brim
stone seem like frigidaire. She says:

150 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
One man who had committel an assassination and had been executed
for his crime was said, by one of H. P. Blavatsky's teachers, to be living
through the scenes of the murder and the subsequent events over and
over again in Kamaloka, ever repeating his diabolical act. . . .20
The Mahatma K. H. in the Mahatma letters to A. P.
Sinnett is authority for the statement that "the very
wicked and impure suffer the tortures of a horrible night
mare." And to quote Mrs. Besant again: "A suicide will
repeat automatically the feelings of despair and fear
which preceded his self-murder and go through the act
and death-struggle time after time with ghastly persist
ence."
Men go to such a place, the argument runs, because
they have about them a certain amount of matter be
longing to this region, which they must slough off before
they can ascend higher.
The atmosphere here is gloomy, heavy, dreary. Men here show out
their passions in all their naked hideousness, their naked bruality ; they
are full of fierce, unsatiated appetites, seething with revenge, hatred,
longings after physical indulgences which the loss of physical organs in
capacitates them from enjoying. 1
This truly is hell. But is must not for a moment be
confused with the hell of Billy Sunday or mistakenly
supposed to be in any given locality. It's going on all
around us in the astral realm all the time. Lechers and
roues rove ever malignantly about in the spirit world,
"crowding round all foul resorts on earth, round brothels
and gin-places, stimulating their occupants to deeds of
shame and violence, seeking opportunity to obsess them
and drive them to worse excesses."
21
The shades of Count
de Sade and Bluebeard, I take
it,
hover around Harlem
cabarets.
This malignant influence of the spirits
is
particularly
dangerous in regard to executed murderers, "who sur
round themselves with an atmosphere of savage thought-
forms and, attracted to anyone harbouring revengeful or
violent designs, they egg him on into the actual com
mission of the deed over which he broods."

THEOSOPHY 151
It might well be guessed that here too is the hell of
the vivisector. His mutilated victims crawl about over
his body like vipers, howling, squirming, quivering under
the pain of the heartless knife that put them here.
The second region of Kamaloka is only a shade better.
For those who people
it,
Mrs. Besant asserts, are gen
erally worried about something left behind. They will
try to communicate with their friends, and
if
they do
not succeed, they will resort to knockings and other
noises, "directly intended to draw attention or caused
unconsciously by their restless efforts." So acute
is
the worry of these spirits that "it
is
charity in such
cases for some competent person to communicate with
the distressed entity and learn his wishes, as he may thus
be freed from anxiety which prevents him from passing
onward." 22
The third and fourth regions of Kamaloka are but
etherealized copies of the second. The fifth offers new
characteristics, for here are the materialized heavens of
all religions. The sixth
is
inhabited by souls of the ad
vanced type, their delay there due to the "large part
played by selfishness in their artistic and intellectual life,
and to the prostitution of their talents to the desire-nature
in
a
refined and delicate way." Religionists of a
prog
ressed kind pass through this stage of Kamaloka. The
seventh region
is
where the Masters and Initiates have
Their intellectual home.
So much for the cardinal point of re-embodiment. The
monad, or original entity of the Life Force, passes
through the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms,
until at
a
high point of animal development he becomes
human. He
is,
however, never an ape, as Madame Blavat-
sky has conclusively shown. Then begins
a
further evolu
tion, accomplished by means of repeated incarnation, to
gether with recesses in many stages of Kamaloka. If he
lives nobly in the flesh and
is
purified sufficiently in Kam
aloka, he ultimately becomes aseka. We are all potential
deities—gods in the making. "With reincarnation, man
is

dignified, immortal being, evolving toward

Theosophy has little to say of God as such. He is trans
fused divine essence, or any other ambiguous combination
of words you may confect. In Hastings's Encyclopedia of
Religion and Ethics, he is defined for the initiated as the
One existence which is the source of all existence, potential and actual,
the super-life and the super-consciousness in which all life and con
sciousness inheres, eternal beneath the transitory, changeless beneath the
fleeting, unsupported but supporting all, all-embracing, all containing, the
One without a Second.23
Man is an emanation of God just as a ray is from the
Sun. Hence to know one's deepest self is to know God.
Theosophy posits man's identity of nature with God and
his identity of nature with everything in the universe.
We are indebted to the Right Reverend Charles W.
Leadbeater for the choicest single piece of literature on
Theosophy. Bishop Leadbeater is Bishop of the Diocese
of Australia for that curious cult known as the Liberal
Catholic Church—a body which deserves separate if not
extensive treatment. His writings on Theosophy, how
ever, approximate those of Mrs. Besant both in number
and fancifulness. It was with Mrs. Besant that he collab
orated in producing during the summer of 1910 the
work I am concerned with. He has long been identified
with theosophy and is to be remembered chiefly for the
litigation involving him and young Jiddu Krishnamurti
from 1905 to 1909. Of this, more anon.
The authors of the book mentioned explain that for
five evenings a week they shut themselves up in a room,
gave themselves over freely to the clairvoyant impulse,
and recorded precisely what they saw. Two members of
the Society, Mrs. van Hook and Don Fabrizio Ruspoli,
were good enough to write down all the entranced au

thors said. The result of these lucubrations is published
under the slender title, Man: Whence, How and
Whither? After half the story has been told, Mrs. Be-
sant drops out of the picture and in a graceful waiver
explains that the rest of the book is solely the work of
her collaborator.
In the main the book is an extravagant attempt to
sketch the beginnings of the sixth Root Race—the one
which shall follow us and occupy a continent not yet born
but slowly rising, fragment by fragment, out of the
Pacific. The story of the world to date is rather snappily
set down, and in it Annie Besant appears as Herakles,
W. Q. Judge as "Phocea," H. S. Olcott as Ulysses.
When it comes to deal with the future, however, the
book reads like a prophecy of the senior class in the local
High. It has to do with events no farther off than 2700
A. D. and concerns itself with a little community of
Theosophists who have been set apart for the founding
of this new Root Race. The scene is that garden spot of
the world, in which Mrs. Besant has already had the
foresight to invest —Lower California. The Manu and
High Priest of the Race has selected from the sacred
circles of the Society a number of assistants with which
to breed those superior entities who will people the Great
Community. Exogamy is as taboo as it is among the
Bantu, for the stock must be kept pure at all costs. The
Community dwells apart, bent solely upon producing a
race of supermen and superior women. Visitors are nei
ther prohibited nor encouraged to come. The fare is en
tirely vegetarian, for one of the standing rules is that
nothing shall be killed. There is a newspaper-telephone
contraption known as the Community Breakfast Chat.
Manifestly there is no law or crime, for all are there for
the common good and each is motivated by Service.
Moreover, every institution and practice known to us
benighted moderns we find transformed by the high pur
poses of the inhabitants. Marriage, for example, has duty
as its great motive, not passion. The ordinary sex pas
sion has been amazingly well dominated, so that mar
riage has a purely reproductive function. When two

persons wish to marry they go to the Manu and ask a
blessing. Usually they arrange well in advance with a
prospective son or daughter, so that they can say defi
nitely to the Manu that such and such a man wishes to
be born from them. It sometimes happens that the pros
pective offspring actually arranges the marriage:
One man will call to another and say: "I am expecting to die in a
few weeks and I should like to have you and Miss X for my father and
mother. I have some karmic ties with both of you that I should like to
work off; would that be agreeable to you?" 2*
The Bishop informs us that the plan works well.
At the time when Bishop Leadbeater looks into his
clairvoyant crystal, the Council, composed entirely of
men, is conducting experiments in the creation of mind-
born babies. "They have produced some respectable
copies of humanity, but have not succeeded in satisfying
the Manu." Just where the entities to embody in these
mind-made babies are drawn from is not clear; but as
Gaius Glenn Atkins, observes, Theosophy predicates an
endless storehouse of souls upon which to draw. Hence,
so small a problem should not greatly complicate the
work of the cosmic statistician.
Meanwhile parentage remains a matter of satisfac
tory arrangement between all parties concerned. It is
hardly necessary to say that death is entirely voluntary
in this paradisaical community, and of course "nobody
looks old until at least eighty." When a man begins to
feel his earthly tabernacle dissolving, he at once looks
about for a suitable rebirth. He selects a father and
mother whom he thinks would suit him, goes to them
and asks if they would care to have him next time. If
they consent, he informs them that he is soon to die, hands
over his personal talisman to them, takes up his abode
at their house and dies conveniently at home.
As a rule the dying man is allowed to select his sex
during the next embodiment. Many seem to practise al
ternating, "but if the number of any sex falls below what

To simplify Theosophy would be to misrepresent it;
but, once understanding what theosophists believe—as
well as the dimensions of their belief —we can well ap
preciate the significance of young Jiddu Krishnamurti
and his auspicious visits to America. It is the theory of
Theosophy that the spirit of the World Teacher —that
same Spirit which was manifest in Yvasa, Zoroaster,
Christ, and Buddha—is bound to come again. Indeed
Mrs. Besant has felt since 1911, when she delivered her
lectures, The Immediate Future, that the time was ripe
for his appearance. She had discovered Jiddu at Adyar,
India, in 1908, and he was at that time introduced as the
coming vehicle. A year later he wrote a book, the con
tents of which were revealed to him in a profitable dream
supervised by the Masters of the Trans-Himalayan fast
ness.
Before his departure for America in 1926, Krishna
murti held, under the auspices of the Order of the East,
a gigantic camp meeting in Ommen, Holland. This Or
der is distinct from the Society, though many persons are
members of both organizations. The Order corresponds
to the millennialists among the Christians, for it believes
that the advent of the World Teacher is imminent. Dur
ing this great meeting at Ommen, many of the pilgrims
became convinced that
. . . the World Teacher's spirit has taken possession of the young Indian,
Krishnamurti, the same spirit that occupied the body of the man Jesus.
Mrs. Besant said today: "Several times the World Teacher has used
the appointed vehicle. The moments of actual possession are becoming
more and more frequent and will shortly be permanent."
Krishnamurti has now reached the stage, his followers say, where he
is able to leave the carnate body at will and commune with the World
Teacher in occult regions.26

stands over and above all human and cosmic activity is
divided into two departments. One shapes the outer evo
lution; the other, "holding in its hands the great circle
of Truth, gives out portions of that Truth from time to
time . . ." The Ruler and the World Teacher are the
department heads. "While the Ruler carefully evolves
the people and shapes subrace after subrace, the World
Teacher is standing beside him." He comes to each of
these races when the time seems propitious and gives to
each precisely what it needs. Thus we have what is to all
appearances a great series of teachers but what is in fact
the Spirit of the one and the same Teacher appearing
again and again.
Hence Krishnamurti. It was unfortunate that the
World Teacher was detained at Ellis Island on grounds
of moral turpitude. This detention involved Bishop Lead-
beater. As reported by the Times:
The long-standing turmoil in theosophical circles during the trials and
reinstatements of Dr. C. W. Leadbeater, Bishop of the Liberal Catholic
Church, were recalled yesterday when a complaint was made to the
Ellis Island authorities that on moral grounds Krishnamurti should not
be admitted to this country. Krishnamurti's father once sued Dr. Lead-
beater to have his son removed from the influence of the doctor, which
he said was harmful.24
Because of this unfortunate affair, and the flippancy
of some of the newspapers the official reception was can
celled. Prominent Theosophists met the boat, however
—among them James Montgomery Flagg.
Krishnamurti's visit was singularly unlike a god's. He
came to bring peace and not a sword. His book, The
Kingdom of Happiness, comprising the talks given at
Ommen, was much too inane to excite the populace or
bring down upon him the wrath of the Sanhedrin. In
Chicago he is declared to have received the greatest
shower of flowers ever emptied upon a distinguished visi
tor. He was a guest of the advertising men's post of the
American Legion, being introduced as a "mystic and a
regular fellow," and to them he said that India's spirit

uality and America's materialism needed to be fused
into perfection. Like a good Twentieth Century messiah
he preferred a private Pullman to the back of a donkey
and luxurious hotel suites to the garden of Gethsemane.
For his wilderness he used the nine hundred acre estate
that he and Mrs. Besant had purchased near Santa Bar
bara, California.
After a stay of nine months he sailed without cere
mony. Reporters found him reclining in a deck chair,
dressed in a grey lounge suit, tan shoes and spats, reading
Elmer Gantry. On the whole his advent had been a fizzle.
The idea of a messiah with an Oxford accent and tweed
trousers somehow missed fire in the minds of most
Americans ; he wore his nimbus much too jauntily. And
the young man's manifest concern with ease and luxury
lent a deal of irony to his parting words: "The chase for
gold has taken the American people away from a religion
founded upon basic philosophy."
He returned to us in the spring of 1928, still benignly
confident of his mission among us. "I am," he said, "the
Voice of the Great Teacher. I have the Spirit. You may
not believe it. I don't care; it makes no difference to
me." 2T
After a brief stay in New York he left for his
estate in California, where, as the centre of a theophany,
he purposes to create order out of the present religious
chaos. Yet the tantalizing fact remains that in that worthy
enterprise he comes into messianic competition with at
least a score of others.

VIII
THE NEW THOUGHT
Erect a mental gymnasium, and utilize every silent and unoccupied
hour, whether day or night, when awake, in swinging the dumb bells
of concentration upon high ideals. . . . Even disorder and pain, when
rightly interpreted, may be regarded as only spectres that prowl in the
basement of our nature to drive us higher.
THIS effusion will serve as well as any to ring up the
curtain on New Thought. From the time it was first
known as the "Boston Craze" down to the present
miraculous feats of the School of Silent Unity, the move
ment has spawned a literature so fulsome and poetic that
any account of it seems a deliberately chosen body of
grotesque Americana. It is at once meaningless and pro
found, Rotarian in content and philosophical in tone.
Palatable ideas about man's divine estate were long ago
the cud of its apostles, and now when one of them writes
a book, he merely regurgitates what the Reverend War
ren Felt Evans stored away in 1889.
While defined as an "attitude of mind and not a cult,"
it takes its place solidly in the front rank of all religions.
Its God "is immanent in nature, finding expression in
every creative energy, colouring the rose, moulding the
leaf, painting the sunset, clothing grass with beauty,
teaching the bird its song." It offers man an exalted view
of himself and his importance in the universe—a view in
this way unexcelled by that of any religious cult since
the days of Eden. Whereas Theosophy teaches that we
are gods in the making, New Thought teaches that we
are now Gods in reality. Ralph Waldo Trine, most re

the World's A-Seeking, addresses his readers thus:
There is no separation between your soul and the soul of the universe.
In the deepest sense you are the great universal soul. . . . Man is God
incarnate.
The same writer, in another of his books —In Tune With
the Infinite —reasons that, since the power of God is
clearly without limit, the only reason for the apparent im-
potency of man is the limitation imposed by man's own
lamentable failure to know himself. To supplement this
idea I quote from Newcomb:
We have latent within us such powers over matter as we have just
begun to dream. In the scheme of creation we shall ourselves rank as
creators, with rare ability to disintegrate and reintegrate at will such
forms as we shall choose to bring into visible existence. . . . We are al
ready warranted in boldly claiming that we have no limitations except
those we have imposed on ourselves. l
This quality of god-almightiness is the sine qua non of
the New Thought. If its emphasis has gradually shifted
during the past fifty years from curing bodily ailments to
securing personal efficiency and charm, it still relies for
its success upon the slumbering deity within. Every man's
soul is a chip off the divine block; my nature is identical
with the Divine Nature. "Man is a microcosm of God,"
and no harm can befall him if he swings properly the
dumb-bells of concentration, for inspiring thought! man
is God. To this effect the International New Thought
Alliance, in convention assembled during 191 7, spoke as
follows :
Man is made in the image of the God, and evil and pain are but
tests and correctives that appear when his thoughts do not reflect
the full glory of the image.
"While Christian thought would bring God down to
man, New Thought would lift man up to God, i. e., the
consciousness of his own divinity." Those are the words
of S. D. Kirkham, who in his book, The Ministry of
Beauty, defends the New Thought theology with these
significant words: "If the sole divinity of Jesus is denied,

the divinity of all men is affirmed." In brief, the New
Thought would make a Jesus of every man, and its posits
for those who take its lessons the same miraculous power
and transcendent worth of character that Christendom
generally assumes to have characterized the life of Jesus
while he walked on earth.
Upon this benign view of the higher mammal the New
Thought for ever rests. It is not strange that the move
ment has attracted to its standards clodhoppers of every
variety —common duds who have put on their ascension
robes after taking three lessons in the power of the will.
By its methods, fifteen minutes a day will make a god of
any man. Its doctrines form a most illuminating com
mentary upon the current scene, for, as we shall have
occasion to see, the New Thought is American psy
chology working naked.
II
The New Thought began as a therapeutic enterprise.
Warren Felt Evans, who shepherded a small flock of
Swedenborgians in New Hampshire, was the first oracle
of the new therapeutism taught by Phineas Parkhurst
Quimby and later filched by Mary Baker Eddy. I quote
from the works of Evans :
Be like Jesus, every one's friend. Seek to make everybody and every
thing happy. . . . Get well by curing others. Impart life, communicate
from your own stock of vital force to others. Jesus healed first the mind,
then the body. He removed the spiritual cause of the disease, and the
physical effect ceased. He addressed himself as a spirit to the spirit of
the patient.
Evans believed that "everything in its last analysis,
or when we come to its inmost reality, is only a thought."
He continues :
What we call the external world and the human body, which is a
part of
it,
are the thought of God, and we come to know them only as far
as we think them. Disease, like every thing,
is
created, or at least
has an existence only by thought. In the phrenopathic method of cure,
it
is
fundamental principle that thought
is
the ground of all reality.8

THE NEW THOUGHT 161
It is not by accident that the above reads suspiciously
like the general belief of Christian Science, Divine
Science, and other schools of mental healing. All of
these quackeries stemmed from a common root, and that
root was none other than Phineas P. Quimby. Evans we
may take as Quimby's interpreter, for self-expression was
not one of Quimby's salient points. Yet the impression
must not be left that Quimby never put pen to paper.
Beginning in 1859, he wrote furiously on the themes
which gripped him most, and during the remaining years
of his life he filled more than eight hundred closely writ
ten pages of manuscript covering over a hundred and
twenty subjects.3 The majority of these manuscripts,
closely guarded by his son and occupying the same re
lation to Science and Health that the non-canonical books
do to the Bible, were not published until 1921, when
Horatio W. Dresser gained the permission of Quimby's
descendants and put them out in carefully annotated
form. I have heard rumours of suppression, which the
publishers deny; at any rate The Quimby Manuscripts
are to be found in any reputable library and they are a
document of rare importance to those who care to trace
the connexion between the New Thought and Christian
Science.
For our present purposes it suffices to say that the
Quimby manuscripts contain the germ of the whole buoy
ant philosophy which has swept America under the di
rection of both the New Thought and the First Church
of Christ, Scientist. I can only cite a few quotations from
the writings of Quimby to show the birth he gave to men
tal healing:
Man is made up of truth and belief; and, if he is deceived into the
belief that he has, or is liable to have, a disease the belief is catching
and the result follows it.
Again:
The Science that I try to practice is the Science that was taught
eighteen hundred years ago, and has never had a place in the heart of man
since ; but it is in the world and the world knows it not.

162 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
The fact
is,
that what the public generally supposes to
be Christian Science
is
nothing more than the New
Thought of Phineas P. Quimby.
I
do not say they are the
same. Indeed, there exist sharp differences between the
two systems. But
it
is
safe to say that the simple ideas
of the influence of mind over body and matter are es
sentially the ideas that Phineas put into the world in
1859. Christian Science offers
a
more abstruse system of
interpretation, one that rings with noisy words and
frightful philosophical ideas which only the initiated
know. What Quimby taught, and what the New Thought
appropriated from him, was purely the value of healthy
mental states. He felt that the medical profession was
first and foremost
a
conspiracy to remind humanity of
its ailments, that we suffer because we are constantly re
minded of suffering, and that the very demeanour of
a
doctor in
a
sick room
is
enough to kill the healthiest of
men.
Quimby must undoubtedly be reckoned as the father
of natural or mental therapeutics in the modern craze
it
has enjoyed. As Dresser remarks in his History
of
the
New Thought Movement, "When lines of inquiry are
to be developed for the good of mankind, God usually
summons
a
man from the common walks of Life.
Quimby
is
certainly not to be accounted for by his edu
cation. His father was
a
blacksmith, and the lad Phineas
attended the district school at Belfast, Maine, where he
spent
a
good part of his therapeutic life. He appears, so
Mr. Dresser says, never to have heard the names of
Berkeley or Emerson. He studied the New Testament
only late in life and he shows no acquaintanceship with
any of the learning of his day. He had his own system
of spelling and his own rules of grammar, which,
if
they
did not always coincide with those of the school books,
at least had the virtue of being uniform, and he fol
lowed them consistently. His son affirms that he was
a
thoroughgoing religionist, "fully believing in immor
tality and progression after death, though entertaining
entirely original conceptions of what death is." When

dying, Quimby said, "I do not dread the change any more
than if I were going to Philadelphia."
Quimby began his labours as a mesmerist. Mesmer
ism, which reached its high tide in France and Germany,
1770-1790, was revived in France after the French
Revolution and found its way to America through the
agency of Charles Poyen, a Frenchman, in 1836. During
one of his public performances in Belfast, Maine, Poyen
failed singularly in his attempted feats and charged that
someone in the audience had perverted his hypnotic in
fluence. "Park," as Quimby was called in the village,
stayed to talk with Poyen and the Frenchman was quick
to see that the lad had remarkable psychic powers.
Quimby began at once to experiment with these powers
and found that, sure enough, he could exert a remarkable
influence over the people of the village.
He took up with a certain Lucius Burkmar, who
proved to be an unusually good subject, and the two made
frequent excursions to the surroundings towns, often be
ing rewarded for their performances by the anger of a
New England mob who seem to have regarded them as
he-witches. One day there happened into town a certain
John Bovee Dods; this practitioner seized at once upon
Burkmar and they were off at once on a tour from town
to town. When Burkmar returned, Quimby found that
Dods had been using the lad to read clairvoyantly the
minds of the patients and that Burkmar, while in a state
of hypnotism, had persuaded the patient to buy the
patent medicines which Dods made his living by hawk
ing. Immediately Park tried the method and found it
successful. The ailing person would take readily what
Lucius Burkmar suggested and the results obtained were
miraculous.
Quimby was not without an analytical quality of mind.
One day he suggested to the sleeping Burkmar that he
prescribe simple herbs for the cure of a dangerous
disease. The patient readily assented and the cure was
every whit as remarkable as though some powerful
patent medicine had been offered. Quimby became at

once convinced that Lucius was reading the mind of
someone present —in all probability the mind of the pa
tient, and that, by the use of mental influence, he could
cure disease readily without recourse to drugs. This was
the beginning. He would put Lucius into a mesmeric
state; the lad would examine the patient, describe his
disease, then prescribe for its cure. The procedure
worked nine times out of ten, and upon the basis of its
success, Phineas Quimby evolved the philosophy that
disease is an error of the mind and not a reality of the
physical body.
Quimby himself was in a bad way. He had, in fact,
been given up to die. One day, however, he got out with
a stubborn mare, who refused to climb a hill. He was
forced to lash her buttocks and to coax her up and down
hill all the way home. He explains that under the ex
citement of the occasion, he found he had more strength
than he had dreamed of, and he began to doubt the doc
tor's diagnosis. That diagnosis was depressing enough.
He was told that his kidneys were partly consumed and
that he had ulcers on the lungs.
This was the state I was in when I commenced to mesmerize. On one
occasion when I had my patient (Lucius) asleep, he described the pains
I had in my back, and he placed his hand on the spot where I felt the
pain. He then told me that my kidneys were in a very bad state —that
one was half-consumed, and a piece three inches long had been separated
from
it,
and was only connected
by
a
slender thread. This
I
believed to
be true. ...
I
asked him
if
there was any remedy. He replied, "Yes,
I
can put the piece on so
it
will grow, and you will get well." He im
mediately placed his hands on me, and said he united the pieces so they
would grow. The next day he said they had grown together, and from
that day
I
have never experienced the least pain from them.*
The subject had done nothing more than read the mind
of Quimby, discover what he thought was his disease,
and then prescribe some simple remedy in which Quimby
was led to believe.
In 1859 Quimby went to Portland, Maine, where he
remained until 1865, at which time he went off ignomin

lously to die with an ulcer of the stomach. During the
years at Portland he performed many remarkable cures
and began to be widely and favourably known throughout
New England. The standard medical science was of
course frightful during this period. Its bunglesome
methods and unsound theories invited departure from the
ordinary course of medical treatment and offered such
fellows as Quimby a remarkable chance for success. It
was while he plied his new trade at Portland, Maine, that
Mary Baker (Glover) Patterson came to see him. As
early as 1861, Dr. Patterson, who was at that time the
husband of the woman who is known to the world
as Mary Baker Eddy, wrote to Dr. Quimby, solicit
ing the aid of his "wonderful power" for the restora
tion of his wife, who had been an invalid for a number
of years.
[The connexion between Mrs. Eddy and Quimby will
be touched on more sharply in the chapter devoted to
Christian Science. Here I give only those facts which
are pertinent to the story of the New Thought. Unless
we are careful, says Sybil Wilbur, Mrs. Eddy's biog
rapher, we will "stray into the quagmire and find our
selves believing that all that follows in the life of Mary
Baker Eddy was the result of her meeting this man."
And that is simply because Quimby made upon Mrs. Pat
terson a most acute and profound impression. His fame
had travelled far and she was only one of the ailing ladies
of the time who felt that if life held any health for her
it was to be found through the instrumentality of Phineas
Parkhurst Quimby. She raked together enough coin to
make the trip to Portland, and at the first silent treatment
she received from Quimby, she met with almost imme
diate relief. Indeed she was even good enough to pub
lish a running account of her recovery in the Portland
Evening Courier, beginning a series of letters carrying a
daily statement of her health and improvement with
these words :
When our Shakespeare decided that "there are more things in this
world than are dreamed of in your philosophy," I cannot say of a verity
that he had foreknowledge of P. P. Quimby. . . .

166 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
There follows a rigmarole which is not pertinent to
our discussion nor was it pertinent to the readers of the
paper; it has only the value of showing that very early
in life—long before she tackled Science and Health, Mrs.
Patterson Eddy was given to Johnsonese that would have
enraged Johnson himself. The letter proceeds:
Three weeks since I quitted my sick room. The belief in my recovery
had died out in the hearts of those who were most anxious for it. With
this mental and physical depression I visited Quimby and in less than
one week from that time I ascended by a stairway of 182 steps to the
dome of the City Hall, and am improving ad infinitum.
In a letter to Quimby dated January 12, 1863, Mrs.
Patterson speaks of herself as a "living wonder and a
living monument to your power," as a result of which
"five or six of my friends are going to see you." In an
other letter: "Dear Doctor, what could I do without
you? Who is wise but you?" Again: "P. P. Quimby rolls
away the stone from the sepulchre of error and health is
the resurrection."
The incredulous will find these letters, together with
other more damaging testimony, in The Quimby Manu
scripts. They suffice to show, I believe, that Quimby was
regarded by at least some of his contemporaries as a re
markable man. Mrs. Eddy paid another visit to him in
1864, and while there, talked long and patiently with him
about his methods. After his death, Mrs. Patterson wrote
to Julius W. Dresser, a close friend of Quimby's, told of
a serious fall she had had on an icy pavement, and of
her speedy recovery by Quimby methods. She explained,
however, that she had become depressed by friends since
her recovery, and she prayed Dresser to take up Quimby's
work and render her some assistance. But Dresser did
not feel equal to the task and Warren Felt Evans had not
yet written his first book.
There follows, then, a noticeable hitch in the gait of
the movement that the lamented Quimby had set on foot.
It was not until 1875 that the first edition of Science and
Health was published, and by that time Phineas Quimby
was only a memory to Mary Baker Patterson. In short,

THE NEW THOUGHT 167
what had started out to be New Thought became, for a
time at least, Christian Science. Not until 1883 did the
followers of Quimby awake from their slumbers to see
their cherished ideas taking form in an alien cult. By
that time Mrs. Eddy had denied Phineas three times
every day. In a letter to the Boston papers, dated March
7th of that year, she admits she knew Phineas about
twenty years ago, "and aimed to help him." "We saw he
was looking in our direction and asked him to write his
thoughts out. He did so, and we then would take the copy
to correct, and sometimes would transform it so that he
would say it was our work, which it virtually was; but
we always gave him the copy back." Mrs. Eddy goes on
to say that she tried hard to gain him public favour, "and
it wounded me to see him despised."
Obviously no one was in line for the mantle of the
Prophet Phineas. New Thought got under weigh heavily
and has moved at a lumbering, sprawling gait ever since.
Its devotees teach and practise individualism of a de
termined sort and succumb unwillingly to the ardours
of organization. In the early days meetings devoted to
the new therapeutism came to be held from time to time.
The silent treatment practised was akin to prayer and
"the silence," as it has since been called, became a not
able feature of the meetings. Ministers of the liberal kind
—the movement has always been identified with the
liberal theology—began to attend and supplied the wor
ship feature. The first of these societies, according to
Dresser, was in Boston, where with appropriate extrava
gance, it was called "The Church of the Divine Unity."
Dr. Holcomb, another Swedenborgian, was the first
writer to employ the term New Thought capitalized.
With all deference to Quimby, Holcomb may be said
to be the true founder, for, as a friend of mine has re
marked, were it not for capital letters and hyphens, there
would be no New Thought. In 1887 Mr. Charles M.
Barrows, "formerly a teacher and well acquainted with
the history of thought, pointed out that idealistic con
ceptions were in the writings of Emerson, howbeit thera
peutics had not until then noted the resemblance." Thus

Emerson became identified with the movement and re
mains to this day one of its involuntary fathers. Recently
there has been announced a booklet, Emerson's Concept
of Truth. This has been arranged by Henry Richardson
Thayer, who explains that "not a word of Emerson's has
been changed or added to, but widely separated sentences
have been brought together. Price 28 cents."
Other names were of course suggested. In Boston,
Higher Life. In England, Higher Thought. In New
York the little group was for a time known as the circle
of Divine Ministry. In the West the movement became
known as Divine Science or Practical Christianity. But
the term New Thought won out, gaining currency dur
ing the first meeting of the Metaphysical Club in Bos
ton during 1894-1895. It was used also as the title of a
little magazine published at Melrose, Massachusetts, in
1894. The Metaphysical Club gave the movement im
petus, for the purposes were cleverly disguised by the
importation of such speakers as Julia Ward Howe and
Hamilton Wright Mabie. By 1899 there were enough
votaries for a convention in Boston and there had been
earlier convocations of the Disciples of Divine Science
in Western cities.
A constitution and by-laws for the International New
Thought Alliance were published in 1916, affirming the
purpose of the society to be:
To teach the infinitude of the Supreme one, the Divinity of Man and
his infinite possibilities through the creative power of constructive think
ing and obedience to the voice of the Indwelling Presence which is our
source of Inspiration, Power, Health, Prosperity.
In 1917 the New Thought Alliance proclaimed:
The essence of New Thought is Truth, and each individual must
be loyal to the Truth he sees. The windows of his soul must be kept
open at each moment for the higher light . . .
We affirm health, which is man's divine inheritance. Man's body is
his holy temple. Every function of
it,
every cell of
it,
is
intelligent, and
is
shaped, ruled, repaired, and controlled by mind.
We affirm the divine supply. He who serves God and man in full
understanding of the law of compensation shall not lack.

THE NEW THOUGHT, 169
Obviously this national intoxicant is compounded of
many elements brewed over the flames of egotism and
served in barrels to all who join the picnic. And before
we witness the curious spectacle of the plebeian populace
drunk on divinity, we need to understand what may be
roughly called the philosophy of the New Thought as
exemplified by its most advanced thinkers.
From the outset the movement has fattened upon two
carcasses—that of a pathetic and often atrocious medical
science and, equally, that of a monstrous, blood and iron
theology. Both medicine and theology have grown less
and less egregious since 1875. They have felt the solid
impact of modern thought, and the movement started by
Quimby and Evans has been in the front rank of the fierce
reaction against them. And the fact that the evils against
which the first attack was launched have been ameliorated
accounts, I think, for the recent preoccupation of the
New Thought with such questions as how properly to
use the divinity in all of us to get sex appeal, prosperity,
and at least a modicum of happiness out of life.
Of course the message of good health by drugless meth
ods is still borne joyously by the disciples of New
Thought. Even Henry W. Dresser, whose point of view
is that of an historian, softly voices the conviction that,
"there is a simple, natural way out of every trouble, that
kind nature, which is another name for an omniscient
God, is every ready to do her utmost for us." The temple
of New Thought rings with sounds of cosmic joviality
and good humour. Its God is both a father and a mother,
ajid it is inconceivable that we should suffer pain and
sorrow under such beneficent parentage. ''True life,"
says Mr. Newcomb, one of its most intense exponents, "is
unutterable sweetness in which all the shadows of our
yesterdays are woven into the soft tints of the morning
sunshine."
Disease, then, is clearly an impostor. It has no right
ful place in the present kingdom of the Lord and will
in time be banished from the earth. Mind is everything;
the carnality of our minds accounts for disease and the
purity of our minds will remedy it. Patterson, in his book,

170 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
In The Sunshine of Health, says: "The many inflamma
tory diseases that come from poor circulation and poi
soned blood are simply the expression of inflamed mental
conditions." Trine, in All's Right with the World, as
serts: "The fevers and distempers of the body only ex
ternalize those of the mind." When we think that "God
is the infinite spirit of which each one is a part in the
form of an individualized spirit," we can readily see
why sickness is absurd and its cure a matter of simple
practice. This cure proceeds, as we shall have adequate
occasion to see in a moment, by a method of simple af
firmations and visualizations. One of these affirmations,
as supplied by Paul Ellsworth in The Gist of the New
Thought, follows:
I am an expression of Divine Life, and in vitality, body, and affairs I
show forth the limitless love, power, and wisdom of my Father."
We must not falsely suppose the New Thought to be
simple; its feats are not performed by the sheer influ
ence of mind over matter. In point of fact the mind
seems never strong enough to cure the body unless it
works in terms of ritual and symbol; the process must
be mysterious. Christian Science would still have been
a struggling troupe of shoemakers in the slums of Boston
if its methods had been what people commonly sup
posed they were. The same is true of the New Thought.
It invokes formulae and anoints with mental oil. Julia
Seton, in her book, The Psychology of the Solar Plexus,
teaches that disease derives from a lack of harmony be
tween the physical body and the inner bodies; and then
she offers this advice:
To correlate the first and second bodies, get a beautiful thought and
then begin to breathe deeply through the nose and exhale through the
mouth, thereby massaging the solar plexus and increasing its blood flow.
Newcomb, in The Principles of Psychic Philosophy,
quotes with great force the old . Rosicrucian formula,
thoroughly applicable to the ritualistic method by which
the New Thought operates.

THE NEW THOUGHT 171
God is love. God is law. We are law.
God and Love and Law are one. We are Love.
We are one. We are God.
The therapeutism of New Thought must not be con
fused with that of Christian Science. There are points of
similitude between the two beliefs, but their methods of
healing, or rather their philosophies of healing, differ
sharply. I quote from Patterson :
Christian Science and the New Thought agree that all life is one; that
God is all in all; that all intelligence is one. And they disagree on the
following points : Christian Science says the visible world is mortal mind ;
the New Thought declares the universe to be an expression of God's
work. Christian Science asserts that sin, sickness, and death have no
existence. The New Thought affirms that they have an existence ; but
that their existence is only limited and their destruction comes through
right thinking and hence right living.
The absolute idealism of Christian Science denies the
existence of matter, while the New Thought is content
to say that mind expresses itself in matter and is able to
control it. Christian Science relies upon external au
thority to enforce its decretals; the New Thought is for
ever calling to the God within. In short, the New
Thought is one gigantic attempt to spiritualize matter by
asserting that it is wholly amenable to the control of mind.
In an attempt to distinguish between matter and mind
and spirit and yet not get into the throes of materialism,
Newcomb says :
Matter is mind at a slower rate of vibration. Mind is a matter at
a high rate. Spirit is infinitely more rapid than either and rules both.
I have said that the New Thought arose in part as an
insurrection against the grim theology of yesteryear. In
the manner of Spiritualism and for widely different rea
sons, it recruited its ranks in the early days from dis
contented clergymen of the Unitarian and Universalist
Churches. That such ministers were in evidence at the
early sessions of the Metaphysical Club and were num
bered among the advocates of Quimby's teaching, we
have seen. Henry Harrison Brown, in The New Thought

172 THE CONFUSION OF JONGUES
Primer, says that "in Transcendentalism we may prop
erly locate the birth of New Thought," and that "in Uni-
tarianism we find the nearest approach on the intellectual
side."
The fact is that the rise of modernism has virtually
taken the wind out of the movement's sails. Time was
when the Metaphysical Club and the Church of the
Higher Thought offered a refuge to weary ministers
who suffered from the bludgeoning of conscience. Here
they could advocate, without the feeling of insincerity,
the doctrine of humanism which has now come to be the
stock in trade of all modernist clergymen. Here the im
pact of the new knowledge was not only felt, but ad
mitted. Indeed it may be said that through the New
Thought and its often indelicate doctrines, the field was
ploughed for the gorgeous crop of Christian humanism
which has of late years begun to sprout in America. The
New Thought has always boldly denied Genesis, and it
was among the first expressions of the happy thought
that there is no conflict between real science and true re
ligion. Both have long been regarded by its writers as a
quest for Truth. To quote Abel Leighton Allen, "Science
in its broadest aspect is a search for the knowledge of
God."
Obviously, then, it has brought to theology certain
savoury ideas which the stomach of the Nineteenth Cen
tury needed and relished. Many clergymen found here
both the kind of ideas and the freedom and independence
which they wished. But none the less we must observe
that many of its tenets are yet far in advance and
considerably different from the wildest doctrines enter
tained by modernists. Its humanism is not Christian hu
manism, and its deification of man has always outraged
the general sense of theological propriety. In the abstract,
its theology leaves little room for priestly mediation or
for any of the saving devices of religious systems. That
being the case, we cannot expect the clergy in general
to take very kindly to the New Thought. "Man's fall,"
it insists, "has been upward. He began in the lowest form
of animal life and now stands at the summit of creation."

THE NEW THOUGHT 173
Perhaps the worst crime that the New Thought com
mits against theology is to be found in its resonant denial
of evil. Allen charges that the concept of evil derives
largely from a conspiracy on the part of the Churches,
that they have created a Satan to incarnate that evil,
whereas, in point of fact, evil is only misdirected energy.
"All forces," says he, "are good and only as they are mis
directed do they produce harm. . . . The New Thought
does not teach the moral depravity of man. Such thoughts
demoralize and weaken the individual."
Being without a devil, this cult concerns itself with
good entirely, and with the result that the literature of it
is effusive and often sticky. Even Mrs. Eddy had her
devil, but the New Thought has none. It talks for ever
of high ideals and divine precepts until one is shortly
surfeited. Its view of prayer, for example, is vague and
florid :
Prayer is the bringing of the conscious mind into touch with the uni
versal mind. It is lifting the soul into the presence where one feels the
glow, the beauty and the harmony of the divine presence, and the glory
of vibrations that are the source of universal truth.
It has given to the world such poetry as that of Ella
Wheeler Wilcox. I quote from her volume, New.
Thought Pastels:
All sin is virtue unevolved,
Release the angel from the cloud—
Go love thy brother up to God.
Of this great trinity no part deny,
Affirm, affirm the Great Eternal I.
When the great universe was wrought
To might and majesty from naught,
The all creative force was—

preoccupations of the New Thought advocates, par
ticularly as these concern the great unwashed throng
who make up the bulk of the movement's votaries. Even
the therapeutic message of the movement has diminished
in recent years; its theology is the property of a few
vigorous and independent writers. What the whole af
fair now amounts to is getting personality and wealth by
the shortest possible circuit. It preaches what Gaius
Glenn Atkins dubs the Gospel of Getting On. Of this
Gospel Orison Swett Marden and his like have written
both the new testament and the acts of the apostles. Mar-
den's titles are sufficient: The Victorious Life, He Can
Who Thinks He Can, The Victorious Attitude, Self-
Investment, Be Good to Your Self.
In getting wealth, happiness and charm, the process
is really just as simple as that of curing constipation.
Julia Seton Sears, in The Key to Health, Wealth and
Love, says it can be done "simply by getting the interior
attitude of seeing, feeling and being opulent." Mrs.
Genevieve Behrend, tells how she attracted twenty thou
sand dollars to her in six weeks so that she might go to
sit at the feet of Troward.5 Mrs. Behrend does not tell
how she actually got the money but tells of making men
tal pictures of twenty one-thousand-dollar bills until one
day she was bathed with joy, and that night her picture
showed an avenue for acquiring the money.
The New Thought has been defined by Elizabeth
Towne, who began with thirty dollars capital and has
built up an enormous plant at Holyoke, Massachusetts,
as "the fine art of recognizing, realizing, and manifest
ing the God in the individual." She herself has been
relentlessly engaged in this holy work since 1896, radiat
ing Truth and Sunbeams monthly through her psychic
organ, Nautilus. She writes books on Just How to Wake
Up The Solar Plexus, Just How To Concentrate and
Just How To Cook Meals Without Meat. For almost a
generation her journal has been carrying on. ... In
1908 Nautilus carried the announcement of C. D. Lar-
B See Thomas Troward, The Edinburgh Lectures on Mental Science, (New
York, 1913). These lectures have given The New Thought its greatest dignity.

son's book, The Great Within. One of the chapter titles
was, "How To Train Your Subconscious Mind To Work
Out Your Problems While You Are Asleep."
Mrs. Towne's editorials are always confidential talks,
filled with such advice as "Your real trouble is that you
lack self-confidence." Almost invariably they take the
form of talks to some distressed subscriber. One is ad
dressed to The Quiet Girl Who Doesn't Make Friends
Easily:
You have all the qualities of a social success. All you need to do is
to let your light shine, let your loving kindness radiate to everybody
with whom you come in contact.
As a formula for making friends, she gives this affirma
tion :
Every man I meet is my brother who has just found me ; we rejoice in
each other, we smile at each other, we ask questions of each other, we
express ourselves frankly to each other in truth, we glorify each other
and are proud and happy in our equality and divinity and in the differ
ence of our humanity. We are glad to be alive and to get acquainted !
I am lovingkindness, and I express it freely, happily.
To the sad-eyed, inadequate, care-worn peasantry, the
words of Nautilus are addressed, bearing monthly the
message that everybody's God. To a man in a London hos
pital, Mrs. Towne writes :
God is in his heaven within you. You are His perfect son in a perfect
world NOW. Let go the outer world and KNOW Him within. LET
Go and let God work in you, through you, blessing all the world. . . .
Spend your time BLESSING all the world, actively. Get busy ACT
IVELY BLESSING everybody.
Mrs. Towne has a cure for everything. She writes more
books than anyone save H. G. Wells. One deals with How
To Grow Successful and claims to "make you Dollara-
tive where you were merely Centsitive before." She gets
as many letters as the School of Silent Unity, most of
which relate to success in producing happiness or charm.

The desire of this woman was for an appropriate com
panion and a home of her own. She once had a dream of
tacking down a green carpet. A little later chance had
it that she began keeping company with a young man of
her ideals. Not long after that she married this young
man and they actually had a little green carpet in their,
home. As for the ear, why "I visioned a sound ear every
morning and evening, and in less than six months I was
fully restored."
Another subscriber to the Four Lesson Course offered
by Mrs. Towne says:
The first two lessons have really made a new woman of me. I have
demonstrated a sale of property whare it was impossible to sell an
acre. And I found a new home as I visualized and asked for.
The business done by Nautilus is mostly financial and
spiritual. It heals fewer than it enriches. Mrs. Towne
operates on a basis which the churches of the orthodox
fold would do well to emulate. Every message is trans
mitted through the printed word. Books cure. A letter
directed to her brought in reply one copy of Nautilus
(retail price, $.20), one multigraphed letter telling that
the secret of success is Will Power and offering Nautilus
and two pamphlets for $1.40, and a book list affording
the convert a chance to buy $163.42 worth of books.
One would expect to find all sorts of fakirs flocking
to the standards of such an enterprise, preying upon its
credulous victims. The advertisement carried by Nautilus
evidence the kind who read and advertise. Thus one man
makes this bold command :
DON'T pay me a cent IF I CAN'T give
YOU A MAGNETIC PERSONALITY
5 Days Free Proof
I can give you charm that makes you irresistibly popular, personal
power that will indelibly influence the mind of your friends and amaze
others.

of Jerusalem and other towns and cities were his when ever he chose

178 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
An idea of the articles consumed each month by avid
godlets is afforded through the following excerpt from an
analysis by one Thomas Boyd Parker:
A Psychological Trouble Shooter tones up the human machine. He
looks first at your "gas" as to quality and quantity. Maybe your piston
rods are worn and "leak." Maybe it is a faulty carburetor. You are not
a good mixer.
He proceeds to list five columns of Christian virtues and
ends by advising his readers: "Claim for yourself every
good quality you see in others." These articles are for the
most part paragraphed in the manner of Glenn Frank:
If we ourselves believe this, we will live it!
If we do not, we take an anti-Christ attitude.
I have cited so much banality in order that I might
show how the New Thought actually works, once it gets
going among the solid citizenry. Its whigmaleeries are
perfectly sound so long as they remain the property of a
few skilled writers who talk convincingly in terms of
practical metaphysics. But once they are shared —as the
New Thought insists upon sharing them —with the halt,
the maimed, the blind and the botched, we have a re
ligion of high-pressure advertising and cures by parcel
post. The New Thought, perhaps more than any other
faith of today, is the religion of the People. It supplies
by return mail what most of us want—harmony and
prosperity. It offers the pleasures of life for a thought,
and that it has attracted the devotion of millions of
Americans need not astonish us. It is the Correspondence
School of the Soul —America's distinctive contribution
to the faiths of mankind.

IX
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
The most that can be said for Christian Science is that
it has invested drugless healing with blue lights and in
cense. That, I believe, is a statement which can be borne
out by the facts, and if it can, it explains a lot. It ex
plains, for one thing, why the followers of Mary Baker
Glover Patterson Eddy have secured an inflexible hold
upon the dupes of the commonwealth, and why the wealth
and vigorous influence of the theocracy the sainted
woman left have not been equalled among modern re
ligious cults. It explains, too, why she attained apotheosis
in her last earthly days, why thousands of her devoted
students made annual pilgrimages to the shrine she
erected at Pleasantview, Concord, and why she travelled
in state when she travelled at all, with a pilot engine in
front and another to protect the rear of her special train.
And it explains, too, the envy of the rest of Christendom,
an envy which has expressed iself in venomous attacks
and villification. She taught us how to make healing a
sacred process, and in so doing put the great number of
Christian denominations to appropriate shame.
If we may put an age in a sentence, it is this: Mesmer,
disenchanted German that he was, wrested the privi
lege of healing from the Churches; Mother Eddy, de
vout and God-fearing American that she was, restored
it. That, with due allowance made for the process of dis
covery and interpretation, is the whole story of Chris
tian Science.

than her biographer, Sybil Wilbur, she went expecting to
see a God-man, and not the earthly satyr and ignorant
blacksmith that she found.1 And when, because of her in-
intense faith in his powers, she was miraculously
healed of an ailment which had made her an invalid
since childhood, she saw at once that it was the work
of God; and she tried immediately to get Quimby to
see the same divinity in it. It
is,
I
think, unfair to say
that Mother Eddy pirated Quimby's method, though
Mark Twain and
a
great many smarter men than
I
have
said just that. The truth
is
that she dressed Quimby's
system in cassock —she spiritualized his mesmerism and
made Christianity out of his practice. That was her con
tribution. She was one of those queer people who persist
in seeing God in everything —lightning, stones, brooks,
and whatnot. She could understand no phenomenon apart
from its origin in the divine. Hence, when she arose from
Quimby's couch and ascended the hundred and eighty-
two steps of the City Hall in Portland to demonstrate her
recovery, she was convinced—and nothing could change
her mind —she was convinced that she had been cured by
the direct intervention of Almighty God.
Because of the scandals that blew like a hurricane
through the later years of her life, because of the frequent
and well founded charges that she was avaricious and
domineering, we have lost sight of the one fact which ex
plains Christian Science in terms of its founder. She was
a
vigorously and tediously religious woman. It was not
by accident that, as revealed by the most recently sup
pressed documents, her last years were spent in unearthly
fear of mental assassins, of malignant spiritual forces
which she believed worked as viciously against her as
they had against her last husband shortly before his death.
She was
a
woman who believed whole-heartedly in spirit
ual entities. A child of devout and God-fearing parents,
she was for forty years
a
faithful member of the Con
gregational Church, from which she withdrew to found
her own. "From my very early childhood," she declares,

things," to seek God where she might find him. Her
father had the feeling that her brain was too large for
her, so he kept her out of school and tutored her at home.
Miss Wilbur tells us that on cold nights she would go
out and cuddle down by the side of her father's pig pens,
praying God to keep the pigs warm and happy.
Mary's childhood must not be passed over lightly. Her
father was a man of childish temper and perverse mind,
and all of his children were headstrong and high-
tempered. Early in life Mary was released from the or
dinary discipline of the home because of the nervous fits
to which she was given with increasing violence and
frequency. It became the chief concern of the household
to avoid these storms of hysteria. In form they resembled
convulsions. Mary would fall headlong to the floor,
"writhing and screaming in apparent agony." Again she
would drop as if lifeless and would lie limp and motion
less until restored. At other times she would become rigid
and cataleptic and was for a time in a state of suspended
animation.2
In these states she was the object of solicitous care. Her
father put straw and bark in front of the house and on a
nearby bridge to avoid noise from the passing of wagons.
Later her second husband, Dr. Daniel Patterson, a rov
ing dentist, spent a great part of his evenings killing frogs
who persisted in croaking along a neighbouring brook.
She soon reached a stage where she had to be rocked
to sleep. This job usually fell to the hired man and was
first achieved in a large hammock and later in a cradle
especially constructed for the purpose. She had an in
tense pathological desire for swinging. On other occa
sions it was necessary to walk the floor with her as with
a squalling baby or to send for old Boston John Clark,
the mesmerist, to quiet her.
Obviously she was an extraordinarily sensitive child,
and it is credible that her sympathies extended even to
the pigs on her father's farm. Lingering acquaintances
in her old home, according to Milmine, testify that at

fifteen she was a delicate and somewhat attractive girl
who was given over to the practice of showing off. She
used many words, the longer and more unusual the bet
ter, "and her application and pronunciation of them was
always original." She was always vain and always ex
tremely careful of her attire—a habit which never
deserted her. She says in Retrospection and Introspection
that her brother Albert taught her Hebrew, Greek, and
Latin. But the neighbours say that he entered college
when Mary was nine and left home when she was thir
teen. Her early days are reported to have been filled with
the same type of spiritual experiences which marked the
pubescence of Emanuel Swedenborg, Mother Ann Lee,8
the Bab, and others who have in adulthood called dis
ciples. When about eight, she says, she heard a voice call
ing her distinctly by name, three times, in an ascending
scale. The parallel with the experience of the calling of
the child Samuel was patent to her, but little remains to
show that she had anything in childhood but nervous fits.
Her abnormalities continued up to the time she met
Phineas Quimby. Her first husband died soon after their
marriage, and a posthumous child was born. She married
again, this time to Dr. Patterson, the dentist, who took
his bride in the face of warning issued by her father. He
had to carry her down the stairs to the wedding and back
up to her bed when it was all over. He had also to carry
her cradle to their new home, and his services were in
demand the moment he returned from his excursions in
search of practice.
It was after years of suffering and nervousness that
she first heard of the marvel of the day, "Dr." Quimby.
His fame had travelled throughout provincial New Eng
land and Mrs. Patterson determined that she would see
him. Her husband wrote, imploring him to call upon his
invalid wife, and when he replied that he could not come,

home and lived among people who remembered Mother Ann. It is easy to
exaggerate the similarities between the Shakers and certain Christian Science
customs. The Shakers prayed to Our Father and Mother which are in Heaven,
the Scientists to Our Father-Mother God. Both called their founder Mother,
both forbade sudible prayer, and both emphasized celibacy.

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE 183
the destined founder of Christian Science used her wits
to reach him. For the first time in her life she had found
an absorbing interest.
Quimby, it is well agreed among Christian Scientists,
was no more religious than William Marcy Tweed. He
cured by hypnotism, and in a manner which I have de
scribed elsewhere. That he actually cured Mrs. Patter
son, as she was at that time, is admitted by all save one
biographer, who neglects, among other details, to men
tion one of Mrs. Eddy's husbands. He wrought a spell
of hypnotism, says Miss Wilbur, "and under that sug
gestion she let go the burden of pain just as she would
have done had morphine been administered. The relief
was no doubt tremendous. Her gratitude was certainly
unbounded. She was set free from the excruciating pain
of years." *
Here was a perfectly obvious case of hyp
notism, a feat which astonished the experienced Quimby
not a little. Yet it never occurred to him that the Lord
might be in the affair. Next day, however, when Mrs.
Patterson returned, she said to him : "You have no need
to touch me, nor disorder my hair with your mesmeric
passes." For, in her often expressed judgment, Quimby's
work was of the Lord. He was able to cure, she told him,
"by your knowledge of God's law, your understanding of
the truth which Christ brought into the world and which
has been lost for ages." Quimby is reported to have said :
"I see what you mean. Christ has come into the world
again; but in that case I must be John and you Jesus."
This6 Mother Patterson thought was blasphemous; and,
too, it denoted that obtuseness to spiritual reality which
she felt characterized all of Quimby's mental labours
during the time she worked with him.
The fact that Mrs. Eddy made use of materials al
ready at her command has caused, it seems to me, need
less embarrassment to the proponents of the faith.
Certainly Christianity had its Judaism, and Bahaism its
Babism. That she charged Quimbyism with religious fer
vour is adequate contribution for the old lady to have

made. Yet the whole history of Christian Science has
been marked by subterfuge and concealment and hedging
whenever the name of Quimby is mentioned. Quimby is
despised and regarded as a monstrous vulgar fellow,
whereas Mary Baker Eddy is worshipped for her sweet
charms and high spiritual insight. The truth is that
Quimby was no more vulgar than Mrs. Eddy was a seer
of divine truth. Quimby experimented with patients and
cured them by hypnotism. Mary Baker Eddy made a cult
of the whole affair. A cult is a body of believers grouped
around an idea that works, an idea generally revealed by
a prophet, set forth in sacred oracles, and preserved by
reverence, piety, and the authority of the governing body.
But on with the story. Mrs. Patterson insisted, as I have
said, that Quimby healed her by some divine power. This
power she was aware of but he did not understand. She
therefore tried to enlighten him, so Christian Science
tradition has it. And he, the tradition further has
it,
was
eager to take advantage of her superior mental qualifica
tions and heard her gladly. She remained in Portland,
Maine, where the cure was effected, for three weeks, and
saw Quimby every day during that time. She told him,
with her hankering for phrases and oracles, that his
method should be philosophically stated, so that it would
stand like the Rock of Ages. To this Quimby readily
agreed. "He did not contradict her; on the contrary, he
adopted both her language and her ideas"; which
is
by
no means improbable, for
it
is
said that Mrs. Patterson
had studied moral science, whatever that
is,
as
a
girl, and
that she was
a
serious, argumentative, and thoughtful
woman. Quimby was nattered by the interpretation which
she put on his work. She encouraged him to write out
some of his ideas, which he consented to do. They proved,
however,
a
mere jumble of idiocies, so Miss Wilbur says,
and Mrs. Patterson, good woman that she was, consented
to state his postulates for him.
Here began the Quimby manuscript "tradition," and
the tradition had further life when these manscripts were
published by Dresser in 1921 and have, for some curious,
undiscovered, but easily guessed, reason, never been heard

of since. The Christian Science side has it that Mrs. Pat
terson wrote in 1862 and again in 1864 certain manu
scripts for Quimby, "to which she unselfishly and un
guardedly signed his name. These manuscripts, in Mrs.
Eddy's handwriting, interlined with Quimby's emenda
tions, may still be in existence."
8
At this time Mrs. Patter
son had no thought of founding a cult, though she did
have the feeling of discovering a new approach to Chris
tianity and the hankering for a philosophic statement of
this new approach. She was just now taken up with
domestic cares. Upon returning home she got her hus
band released from a Confederate prison. He had gone
to a battlefield as a spectator and had been captured, and
now he was in the hoosegow. He seemed little disposed to
take up his dental practice again, or his domestic rela
tions. He much preferred to drift about from village to
village telling of the thrills he had gotten out of the war
and of the torment he had suffered while a prisoner. The
net result was worry for his wife. In the state superin
duced by the husband's rovings, she approached illness
again, and, in perfect proof of her confidence in him,
went again upon a pilgrimage to Phineas Parkhurst
Quimby, the ignorant and obtuse mesmerist who con
tained so large a spark of divine power.
During this second stay, which was in 1864, she went
frequently to his office, trying all the while to persuade
him to group his thoughts into a logical syllogism. As
for her evenings, says Miss Wilbur, they were spent "in
the attempt to harmonize his notions with her own spirit
ual ideas." She stayed at this time with a certain Mrs.
Crosby, and Mrs. Crosby has said, and the statement is
quoted in the official Life of the priestess, that "Mrs.
Patterson laboured long into the night at her writing."
She now made a final effort to give her husband the
society he needed. She had, with the charm which was
hers and remained hers until her death —and even then
the New York Herald reported she was a beautiful and
well preserved corpse —a chance to move in good society,
were it not for her dreadful, boorish husband. He roved

about New England towns, staying at farmhouses and
smiting the womenfolk of the rural places with his frock
coat, silk hat, kid boots, and gloves. He had, Miss Wil
bur declares, "a silly vanity in his powers of fascination
over equally silly and romantic women." In the end this
silly vanity got the better of him, for he deserted his wife
and ran off with the wife of a prominent citizen who had
engaged his professional services. Like Mother Ann Lee,
Mrs. Patterson was left almost penniless and alone in the
world, though she was never reduced to vinegar. She had
friends, and she lived about from house to house, always
getting into controversies over her doctrines. In due
course the wife of the wealthy citizen came back and Mrs.
Patterson forgave her. Then her husband came, but she
did not forgive him. He left her, continued his roving,
and died a hermit in New England.
At this time, however, she still felt that there was hope
for him, and with a view to getting him into good society,
joined the Linwood Lodge of the Good Templars, hop
ing that its refining influence would make a gentleman
of him. And by this ruse she profited, if not directly, cer
tainly enough indirectly. She was frequently called upon
to address the assembled circle, and here she began to get
her training in the art she later mastered. Her ability was
swiftly recognized and in less time than it takes to tell
it,
she was made presiding officer of the Legion of Honour,
which was the woman's branch of the organization. She
got here her first experience in leadership and organiza
tion. Whether there were any similarities between the
Legion of Honour and the Mother Church, the historians
are not in
a
position to say, but the fact remains and
stands out that the woman who founded Christian Science
got her start in
a
lodge.
Just now, too, her literary being was fast taking shape.
She frequently burst into song, and the results were
printed, along with poems of Whittier and Holmes, in the
local press. The Civil War was drawing to
a
close, and
she had the blood of heroes in her veins. It was only
natural then that many of her poems were sheer outbursts
of patriotic feeling. She was not

proudly and feelingly of the brave men at the front.
At this point Christian Science may be said to have
begun. One evening while returning home from the Le
gion of Honour with a group of friends, she slipped on the
icy pavement, and much to the alarm of her companions, (
fell heavily—she weighed ninety pounds—to the pave
ment. Unconscious, she was carried to the home of a
gentleman near by, and, unconscious, she allowed a doctor
to be summoned. He administered a third decimal at
tenuation of arnica, which she took in a semi-conscious
state. He left her on Friday and the miracle occurred on
Sunday. Her friends had gathered about to watch her
pass away. She called for a Bible and asked them to leave
the room. She read the ninth chapter of the Gospel Ac
cording to St. Matthew, containing the story of the man
sick with the palsy. As she read
it,
there came over her
a
sudden and overwhelming realization of the power of
Christ to save. She felt herself instantaneously cured,
arose, dressed herself, and entered the room where her
astonished friends were assembled. The miracle which
she performed on herself just then she later found "to be
in perfect accord with divine law." Her discovery, in the
judgment of Christian Science historians,
is
to be com
pared in importance and significance to the discovery
Newton made when the apple fell and Watt made when
he saw the boiling kettle. It was the real beginning of
Christian Science,
it
was the discovery of the lost chord
of truth. She did more than experience
a
cure. "She in
that hour received
a
revelation for which she had been
preparing her heart in every event of her life."

herselt weakening. Where could she turn? Her old friend
Quimby was dead. Besides, he was an ignorant mesmerist
and she now had authentic revelation that healing came
from heaven and worked in accord with spiritual laws.
None the less, her confidence in the mesmerist remained,
and though he had passed on, she wrote to Dresser, Quim-
by's friend and confidant, asking for his help in continu
ing Quimby's work. In saying that Quimby was dead,
Miss Wilbur has it that he "could not longer obtrude his
unformulated theories between her mind and its own
spirtual aspirations." 8
None the less, she seemed to want
just that, and wrote to Dresser, asking him if he could
not help her in her hour of need. As we have seen else
where, Dresser declined, saying that he did not feel able
to resume the work which Quimby had laid down.
The consequence was that Mrs. Patterson (still her
name), was thrown upon her own by the fall. "She was
forced to turn to God." And there Christian Science be
gan: in the mind of a competent woman who, as long as
her saviour lived, was content to formulate her own ver
sion of his philosophy, but who, when he was dead, had
self-reliance and presence of mind enough to make the
mare go by her own energy and rulership. Dresser, of
course, reminded her in later years that she had turned to
him before she turned to God. To which she replied, and
with some truth if not with great tact, "After the death
of the so-called originator of mental healing it required
ten years of nameless experience for me to reach the
standpoint of my first edition of Science and Health."
These ten years began at once. To mark their auspicious
opening, Dr. Patterson ran off with another woman in
the manner that I have described. It was the happy sig
nal for complete renunciation. She determined that she
would never again write for fame or money, that she
would devote herself monastically to the great cause be
fore her. She must discover the modus operandi of the
miracle she had wrought. Her family provided her with
some money, and for the next nine years she lived about
from house to house. Indeed, she might be said to have

had no place to lay her head. And if the analogy be
pushed further, as it often
is,
the miracles she performed
in that period makes the chronicle of
it
read like
a
chap
ter from the Gospel according to Luke. Her first cure—
and
I
find no record of her performing cures before the
great experience referred to above—was the cure of
a
bone felon on the finger of
a
child. Another was the cure
of
a
rich young man in
a
fever, who was transformed into
peace and health by the mere hand of Mary Baker
Glover, as her name now was, upon his brow. His parents
came to get him at once, however, and took him to Boston.
She nowhere got credit for her work. Even the benefic
iaries of her powers were suspicious of them, and friends
whom she benefitted were often alienated rather than
grappled to her breast with hoops of steel.
She was known at this time as
a
woman of peculiar
religious views at which people often laughed. In the
social circles which she had almost reached by her work in
the Legion of Honour, she was not popular. She effected
cures among the wealthy, but they were indifferent to
her doctrines. Just now the cultured were not to be her
field. She came to her own and her own received her not.
She was therefore forced to turn for the first disciples to
the poorer class of people in Lynn. Her first active dis
ciple was
a
shoemaker, and many of those who followed
came from the factories at Lynn. Hiram Crafts was the
name of the first. To feed the soul of this shoemaker she
wrote out certain manuscripts, "not entirely different
from those she had prepared for Quimby. She still be
lieved that Quimby had shared the truth of divine heal
ing with her, but her writings were now based entirely
upon her own experiences." Crafts, under her instruction,
became sufficiently adept in the cult of healing to make
a
good living and effect
a
number of startling cures over
the period of his labours. He showed such aptitude, in
fact, that Mrs. Patterson concluded to go and live with
him. This was
a
radical move, for
it
meant forsaking the
cultured class and approaching the groundlings. But her

of an abscess and got much good publicity out of it
Everything, it would appear, was running smoothly. But
there was Crafts' wife, who rather resented the idea of
playing Martha to this woman and did not take long in
making her resentment known. The presence of a superior
woman in the house irked her; besides, this woman was
not contributing dollars and cents to her support, and
this went hard against the grain of Mrs. Crafts' New
England thrift. She did not like to perform menial tasks
about the place while this woman held long and fervent
conversations with her husband, and before anything very
promising came of the first disciple, Mrs. Eddy concluded
that she had better move. One thing she had gained, how
ever. That was the conviction that she could impart an
understanding of the modus operandi of the new philos
ophy to her fellows. She could not only cure. She could
teach others how to cure, and that was a discovery not
to be underrated. Accordingly, she packed her things and
pulled out, convinced that all her philosophy now needed
was a scientific statement.
The significance of the next few years —the formative
years of Science and Health —"can be indicated only
with the most reverent suggestion. . . . The work laid
before her was that of renaming, actually rechristening,
the verities."

That, it seems to me, is the best appraisal
of what Mother Eddy actually did. And the appraisal
comes from her most devoted biographer. The founder
began now to work diligently upon the Scriptures. She
sought to see their spiritual meaning, and not the mere
significance which the words themselves have. She pre
pared a long and fulsome commentary on the verses, in
terpreting each in the light of her discovery. Nothing
escaped her until it had been discovered to reveal deep
layers of unsuspected truth. During these years her move

degree. "It was to the simple-minded that she was con

strained to address herself." The Spiritualists seemed
most amenable to the reception of truth and she spent
much time among them, both to show the error of their
ways and the superiority of the faith that was all the
while taking form in her mind. During the course of her
rovings she visited Sarah Bagley, whom she taught the
art of mental healing. Sarah practised this with great
profit for twenty years, though she was never a Christian
Scientist. She did not follow her teacher out of the maze
into "the bright light of complete understanding." She
refused to lay aside mesmerism and she steadfastly and
stupidly confused her practice with such doctrines.
And that was a fate which befell many of the early
disciples of Mother Eddy. They were for ever taking up
her art and forgetting her sacred theology. This was a
fatal mistake—not always, to be sure, attended by fatal
consequences —but it cast serious reflection upon her
and showed conclusively the error of their ways. Some,
as was the case with Sarah Bagley, continued the practice
of mesmerism with great success, but they were not ad
mitted to the sacred circles and Mrs. Eddy never failed
to express her great dissatisfaction with such methods and
the disparity between them and the real Simon pure Gos
pel of the new religion. This, I believe, accounts as much
as anything else for the tragical fear which haunted her
in old age, the fear of Malicious Animal Magnetism,
which, taking her cue from Revelation 13, she called
the Red Dragon. Throughout her thinking and her teach
ing she was compelled to point out and insist rigidly upon
the difference between merely healing and healing the
divinely approved way. Her greatest enemy was not sick
ness, but the practitioner who could meet sickness by
drugless methods other than her own. She had the same
contempt for them that the Church at large has for a
"moral man." Just as evangelists hawk salvation by the
Blood of the Lamb as the only adequate guarantee of a
good life, she was compelled to hawk healing by Chris
tian Science as the only thoroughly safe way of curing the
sick. And, it was inevitable that she should come to

despise and attribute maliciousness to the methods which
took no account of her doctrine but all account in the
world of her practice.
She started a small class with Sarah Bagley, and it
numbered one who came to play a prominent part in
the rumpus which shook her household of faith a few
years later. The young man's name was Richard Ken
nedy. He was a pimply youth with some competence,
whom the teacher regarded as an apt and promising stu
dent of the new doctrine. She was of course forced to
take what she could get in the way of promise, for her
prospects thus far lay among the uneducated and simple-
minded of the populace. When the time came for her
to move upon Lynn and there establish a class of in
struction, Kennedy begged his benefactor to be allowed
to go. Mrs. Glover saw at once the dangers of taking a
lad of twenty-five to the city. She warned him of the
great temptations of the world, saying that he would be
sorely tried. Would it be possible for him to stand it all?
Could he be spiritually minded? Yes, he felt he could.
[They arrived in Lynn, and Kennedy took up the man
agerial duties for the new school. They rented sleeping
rooms together on the second floor of a private school, and
there the labourers from shoe factories assembled each
week to receive instruction in the art and artifice of
mental healing. Tuition paid by these workers amounted,
thus far, to only a hundred dollars for three weeks' in
doctrination. On the whole the course was exceedingly
popular, and it was not long before the young factory
hands were performing miracles with great zest and
success throughout the community. But here the spectre
of mesmerism began to show itself. It stalked like a
shadow in the wake of the divinely inspired teacher,
threatening to tear to pieces the good work that was done.
One young man's pride and self-sufficiency made him an
apostate. He wrote from Knoxville, Tennessee, that he
had been practising nothing but mesmerism and that it
would be deceitful to call it anything else. His practice
and success at once declined. Invariably the potency of

himself to think that it was only hypnotism that he prac
tised. In view of the dire circumstances which began to
arise, Mrs. Glover forbade the use of hands or physical
manipulation among her students. She could show them,
once and for all, and quite conclusively that there was no
relation between the cure by divine law and the cure by
mental suggestion with physical manipulation and mes
meric passes.
The trouble began with the disaffection of Kennedy.
He had, as a matter of fact, been somewhat popular with
the ladies, and had gotten into high social circles in the
city of Lynn. As a pupil, he had been a disappointment.
Mrs. Glover had expounded the inscrutable to him more
carefully than to any other chela. But alas! she finally saw
that he was a mere mesmerist, as sadly lacking in spiritual
comprehension as the late lamented Phineas Parkhurst
Quimby. He could, benighted soul, see no difference be
tween Christian Science and mesmerism. He had counter
feited her Science—an unforgivable act. He continued
throughout a long career, practising by physical manipu
lation and a vigorous rubbing of the head, becoming one
of the fathers of modern osteopathy. His success only
showed how quickly God sometimes allows evil to flour
ish. And it showed Mary Baker Glover that the time for
her textbook on authentic Christian Science had struck.
There was grave need of some oracle which should voice
cogently and forthrightly the true Science and brand as a
fraud every other method which simulated it. She asked,
then, that her students give up physical manipulation,
and she settled down in 1872 to put the blessed last
touches upon that volume which she was to call Science
and Health with Key to the Scriptures. Mesmeric prac
tice therefore became branded as immoral —meaning that
it was contrary to the ideas of the founder of true Chris
tian Science.
From 1873 to 1875 she worked assiduously on her chef-
d'a-uvre. Her divorce from Dr. Patterson was secured in
1873, and it must have been with greater peace of mind
that she laboured after that. When it was all finished, one
of her pupils, George Clark by name, carted the manu

script off to the publishers in Boston. It was promptly
turned down, upon the sound basis that it would not sell.
A sea story, which Clark carried to the same publishers
at the same time, was accepted and did sell. Mother Eddy
was savagely disappointed, yet she concealed her wrath
against a greater day. Upon Clark's return, they took a
walk through the streets of Lynn, and Mrs. Glover, see
ing prophetically what was yet to come to pass, pointed
to a church and said : "I shall have a church of my own
some day."
Only the prospectus of the book had been declined.
'Before its completion she set about among her students
raising funds with which to swing it privately. Every
where, discussion, controversy, and ridicule pursued her.
She needed a refuge, a sanctuary in which to make the
words she had written ring with divine sentiment. It was
this need which led her to purchase, for fifty-six hundred
dollars, a house on Broad Street, Lynn, later made famous
by the dissensions that arose there. She moved in, did her
writing in the attic, and hung out her sign for students.
A small and devoted class soon assembled in the parlor
downstairs, and here the basis was laid both for the publi
cation of her book and for the establishment of the
Mother Church. Many remarkable cures are said to have
been effected by the students there, and the class, com
posed mostly of workers from the shoe factories, grew by
leaps and bounds. A fund was subscribed for what later
became the notorious first edition of Science and Health,
and the manuscript was dispatched to a private printer.
It was in the upper room of this house, on the wall of
which there hung the words, "Thou shalt have no other
God before me," that Mary Baker Glover completed her
Writ.
Admittedly there have been many sharp criticisms of
Science and Health, and there have also been many
changes in it since that first edition. But that first edition,
whatever its imperfections, "holds, like the Grail, that
receptacle in which the wine was given to the disciples,
the verities of Christian Science." What changes were
made is difficult to say. Obviously Mrs. Glover had

something to say of animal magnetism, and obviously she
had something to say of Phineas P. Quimby. But the
church authorities, with the sharp surveillance of the
Roman See, have kept guard over the first editions, and
.Chaldeans are not permitted to know. Mark Twain wrote
at the time that the sainted book was a hodgepodge of un
related tomfoolery, that he couldn't understand it "and
would rather saw wood" than try. He added to the fore
going the further conviction that Mother Eddy didn't
even write it.
What she herself thought of the book can be seen by the
following:
The works I have written on Christian Science contain absolute
Truth. ... I was a scribe under orders, and who can refrain from
transcribing what God indites? 10
And if this affirmation leaves anyone in doubt of the
feeling which, at least in later life, she entertained about
her own inspiration, I offer the following:
I should blush to write of Science and Health with Key to the
Scriptures as I have, were it of human origin, and I, apart from God,
its author ; but as I was only a scribe echoing the harmonies of heaven
in divine metaphysics, I cannot be super-modest of the Christian Science
Jext book.11
[These words were written in a day of prosperity and
authority when the devotees of the cult expected her to
make asseverations of great pith and moment. In the
days when the book was actually printed, however, she
doubtless felt more nearly super-modest about it. For the
first edition didn't sell in those days—however priceless
it would be today. What is more, the Broad Street house,
where the book was completed, soon became "a theatre
of intense mental disturbance." Whether the incident had

Within a short time betrayers arose to hound her
labours. She had, not one Judas, but many—all of the un
grateful wretches who did not grasp her true philosophy
and ran off about the country practising her art without
teaching her doctrine. Strangely, or inevitably, as you
choose, the rumpus was started when Asa G. Eddy en
tered the house on Broad Street. He was a bachelor living
in East Boston, where he had been the agent of a sewing
machine company. He had been in bad health and com
mon friends had prevailed upon him to make a visit to
Mrs. Glover. She received him cordially, and saw that
here was, every inch, a gentleman. He was kind and un
obtrusive, and had one not known the truth, one might
have thought him to be lacking in strong character. Mrs.
Glover was not misled, however, for she quickly cured
him of his ailment and lined him up in the active work
of her class. As time passed she began to place more and
more responsibility in his hands. Mrs. Glover was in no
way satisfied with the way in which her book was selling.
A young man named George Barry was her sales man
ager. She thought it wise to relieve him of his studies and
put a young man named Daniel H. Spofford in charge of
the sales of the book. Spofford could undoubtedly have
done a better job. He had been a watchmaker and a sailor
before he began taking a course in science and health. He
had gotten hold of some of her manuscripts from other
students, had copied them and mastered the art of heal
ing, but missed the inner point of the doctrine and tried
to establish mental healing on his own hook. Mrs. Glover
sent for him to come to see her, with the result that she
lined him up with the class, and he became for a time
one of her most devoted workers. At the time she wanted

him to take over the book he had built up a rather opulent
practice of his own in Lynn.
After he assumed his new job, the question next arose,
What should become of Spofford's excellent practice? To
which she replied without hesitation that it should be
handed over without cavil to Mr. Asa G. Eddy. What
effect this had upon a crowd of young men and women
from the shoe factories assembled by miracles and held
together by a bond of affection can easily be guessed.
Barry at once began to sulk and kick. Spofford went into
a rage. The girls who had tried to aid in selling the book
from house to house felt insulted by the new arrangement.
On the whole it looked as though the whole band of
disciples might be scattered any moment.
It was just here that Mrs. Glover made one of her most
strategic moves. In the very midst of a war of petty
jealousies and recriminations, she married the cause of it
all. For some strange reason this had a palliative effect,
and the war temporarily ceased. The students gave the
bride and bridegroom a party, playing ring around the
rosey and declaring their allegiance to their teacher. Mrs.
Glover spoke to them very gravely, and by her remarks
and the work of the next few days, they saw that she re
garded the marriage merely as a spritual union, and her
newly acquired husband as one of the students who must
work here like all the rest to put over the cause of Chris
tian Science.
Her influence was temporary, however, and soon the
storm broke again. Thereafter one typhoon followed hard
upon another. George Barry brought suit to recover
twenty-seven hundred dollars for services which he said
he had performed over a period of five years. He got two
hundred and fifty dollars for his pains, probably spoiling
his case by listing such items as fifty cents for carrying up
a bucket of coal to his teacher. But the scandal got out,
and the papers, on the eve of developing their strong
modern scent for news, were avid for details. The group
began to be notorious, and what followed stamped them
as outrageous. Whatever the ground for
it,
the charge was

had inspired and authorized her students to assemble and
concentrate upon Kennedy, Spofford, Barry and other
apostles to do them mental injury. This seemed credible
enough. Here again adventitious ideas and interpretations
popped up to bark at patient Mother Eddy. She had con
gregated shoemakers from the factories of Lynn and
sought to teach them philosophic idealism with spiritual
implications: it was not surprising that they soon began
to believe in witches.
The trouble was precipitated by Lucretia Brown of
Ipswich, who brought suit against Spofford for hoodoo
ing her. She swore before the local grand jury that the
Mephistopheles had wrought bodily harm upon her by
his mental machinations, and she sought to have the court
restrain him from his naughty practices. Neuralgia and
diabetes were among the complaints which she alleged
Spofford had brought upon her by his debilitating mental
attacks.
The case was called in Salem, where witches had been
disposed of with proper dispatch two hundred years be
fore. Arens, a student of Mrs. Eddy's, argued the case
for the girl, and though her biographer asserts that she
had nothing to do with the plan of the case, she did attend
the argument with a number of her students. She ex
pressed herself as being horrified at the interpretations
placed on her work and thought by Arens. It only showed
how he, too, had failed to get the real mysteries of the
cult. The court decided, after due deliberation, that they
could not control Spofford's mind and, as a result, the
case was dismissed. Mrs. Eddy believed that the whole
affair was a mistake, for, she said, the girl could have
resisted the evil influences by "resting in the confidence of
divine Love." There is no evidence to indicate that she
doubted for a moment the evil mental depredations of
Spofford, or the continuance of these on the part of her
enemies until the end of her life.
Her fear of evil spirits increased from this point until
it amounted to demonomania in her last days. Those who
cured by such an earthly process as mental influence be
came in her theology the hounds of hell. A secret society

was organized and through it the students were assembled
to "treat" the apostates. Mrs. Eddy would say:
Treat Kennedy. Say to him: "Your sins have found you out. You
are affected as you wish to affect me. Your evil thought returns upon
you. You are bilious. You are consumptive. You have liver trouble.
You have been poisoned by arsenic. . . ." ls
In reply to criticisms engendered by these sessions Mrs.
Eddy admitted in the Christian Science Journal of Sep
tember, 1888, that a secret society had been organized but
she denied that its workings were "shocking or terrible."
To those who asked her to place less emphasis upon the
doctrine, she addressed herself in 1885:
In my public works I lay are the capacity, in belief, of animal mag
netism, to break the decalogue, to murder, steal, commit adultery, etc.
Those who deny my right or wisdom to expose its crimes are either
participants in this evil, afraid of its opposed power, or ignorant of
it. . . .
In 1887 a department devoted to Malicious Animal
Magnetism was begun in the Journal and continued for,
years. Here the Scientists who had been hoodooed re
counted their symptoms and struggles. One poor wretch
is tormented by the desire to write, and the naughty temp
ter whispers to her that she can "write a book as good as
Mrs. Eddy's." The estrangement of friends and the death
of children are ascribed to the ill will of doubting neigh
bours. One child is reported to have died from the Ma
licious Animal Magnetism of the local Methodists.
Mrs. Eddy turned upon Boston in the Spring of 1878
and there began lecturing upon her discovery. She dis
covered, much to her delight, that it was the cultured
classes and no longer the factory hands who were attend
ing her lectures and growing interested in her doctrines.
She determined, therefore, to lay the foundations of her
church in the city of "liberal culture." With twenty-six
members she organized in 1879 the First Church of
Christ, Scientist, in Boston. Mrs. Eddy was elected pastor
and ordained after the Congregational fashion of the day.
The church had no regular headquarters but met around

in the parlours of its members. She preached regularly
on Sunday mornings and it is said that the sermons were
"exhilarating" and that they moved their audiences to
emotional exultation.
But the seeds of rebellion were in the First Church
organization. And I use the words of a prominent author
ity in the history of the cult. Arens, the young man who
had prosecuted the witchcraft case, wrote a book in which
he stole bodily from Mrs. Eddy's philosophical tirades
upon matter. Eight students walked out of the Mother
Church, charging Mrs. Eddy with "frequent ebullitions
of temper, love of money and the appearance of hypoc
risy." It was only by a quick ruse of expelling these stu
dents first that she saved the Church's name. The remain
ing Scientists she quickly induced to sign resolutions ex
pressing complete confidence in her leadership.
To heighten the tragedy and embarrassment of these
years Asa G. Eddy fell seriously ill and showed signs of
pining away. His case was most perplexing. He simply
wasted with the passing of each day, and none could be
sure what was wrong with him. Mrs. Eddy summoned a
prominent physician of the day, Dr. Rufus K. Boyes, to
make a diagnosis of the case. He pronounced it heart
trouble and let it go at that. But Mrs. Eddy was of a
different mind. She believed that her husband was suffer
ing from the suggestion of arsenic poisoning, for the symp
toms seemed be precisely those of material arsenic. She
foresaw, says her biographer, what the learned physician
failed to see, that the "deadliest poison is the secretion en
gendered by the working of hatred." Mrs. Eddy watched
patiently and anxiously by her husband's bedside, until
she was persuaded by friends to leave. Just before his
death he cried out,
"
Only rid me of this suggestion of
poison and I will recover." But he did not recover. He
died in agony, and though an autopsy failed to reveal any
cause of death other than a weak heart, Mrs. Eddy was
obdurate in her belief that hosts of mental assassins fell
upon her lamented mate and wrought his death. "Who

Eddy's statement that poison mentally administered killed
her husband?"1*
In Mrs. Eddy's mind there was no doubt. "My hus
band's death was caused," she said, "by malicious mesmer
ism." She bewailed in an interview that this "fiend of mal
practice" was loose in the land and explained her failure
to cure her husband by saying that he thought he could
cure himself and she was busy with other things. She
attributed the death to students who had been turned out
of her college "because of their unworthiness and im
morality." "One of my students," she went on, "has been
heard to say that he would follow us to the grave. He has
already reached my husband." She explains that both
she and her husband had constantly to guard against
poison long before his death and that she felt the same
attack that felled him but was able to fight it off.15
The curious fact is that Asa Eddy died of Christian
Science.
Arsenic, in the judgment and philosophy of Mother
Eddy, had no power to kill save as mortal mind thinks
it has. She taught that reality existed only in the province
of the mind. Hence, arsenic mentally administered is
every whit as fatal as arsenic physically administered.
In denying the reality of matter Christian Science affirms
the terrible reality of ideas. The same attitude that cures
can often kill. It is as fatal to imagine illness or debility
as it is healthful to deny their existence and be lost in a
sea of Divine Love. In the system of thought which Mrs.
Eddy gave us, ideas take the place of germs and have the
same vicious existence as bacilli. A good Christian Scien
tist will therefore be as much on guard against a nasty
idea as a prophylactic mother will be against the germ of
typhoid. It is only a short step from this belief to the be
lief in spirits and the feeling that mental assassins can
produce death.
Immediately after her husband's death she telegraphed
Calvin A. Fry to come at once to her home. It was Fry

who dominated the place for years to come, who formed
the inner circle of her protection against malicious
thought-forms which should do her harm. It was Fry
who, according to Dickey in his suppressed book, died
one night and was raised from the dead by the interposi
tion of Mrs. Eddy's powerful Mind, she warred with the
hosts of the enemy as they crowded in upon her, and by
superior Mind routed the hosts which sought to rob her
of her most reliable guard.16
That Dickey's account of these last days is authentic
and accurate has been admitted by Judge Clifford B.
Smith, Chairman of the Committee on Publications for
the Mother Church, at whose behest the book was re
called from circulation immediately he learned of its ex
istence. His reasons were that, while correct in all
details, the book nevertheless gave a "wholly false and
distorted picture" to the world at large and would sup
ply the "enemies of Christian Science" with wadding for
their guns. He further expressed the belief that those
who knew Mrs. Eddy personally or were sufficiently ad
vanced in the knowledge of her teachings, could fit the
incidents recorded into "a harmonious whole."
It seems to me that no occult knowledge is needed to
fit the incidents Dickey narrates into a harmonious whole.
Smith admits that Fry passed through "what mortal
minds call death." He admits, as Dickey describes, that
a system of watches was carefully maintained in the Eddy
home to ward off mental error and protect the old lady
from mental assassins who sought the life of their Leader.
This system was the outgrowth of a belief expressed and
admitted by the church authorities upon Asa G. Eddy's
death.
"It was a constant battle for our leader," says Mr.
Dickey, "to live in order that she might devote her time

Science headquarters and the quotations contained in the World of the dates
mentioned, based on copies sent to Washington for copyright purposes, are
the only parts of the book now available. Dickey came from Kansas City in
1908 to be Mrs. Eddy's secretary. The position held until her death in 1910.
He later became, according to the World, a trustee under Mrs. Eddy's will
and a member of the Board of Directors of the Mother Church in Boston.

and energies to the conduct and welfare of the great
cause." Accordingly she would call the entire household
into her room and, after explaining the crisis which she
faced, would ask each one impressively: "Will you keep
the watch?" and each one would answer in turn, "Yes,
Mother, I will."
Mr. Dickey, quotes Mother Eddy as saying after her
return from one of the drives which it was her wont to
take :
Mr. Dickey, I want you to know it has done me good to go on this
Hrive. Not physical good. But the enemy have made a law that it hurts
me to go on these drives and they are trying to enforce it. I do not take
the drives for recreation but because I want to establish my dominion
over mortal minds antagonistic to belief.
The watch which she carefully prepared was composed
not merely of a schedule of guards, but of certain pre
scriptions which she wrote out for mental attacks. "These
consisted of typewritten sheets of paper containing in
numerical order names or descriptions of the phases of
error Mrs. Eddy wished them to handle. She was con
stantly assailed by malpractice and it was necessary for
someone to take up this work and aid her in freeing her
self from these different attacks." [These by-laws she re
ceived in the same manner that she received Science and
Health and Joseph Smith received the Book of Mormon.
All of which is completely in line with the events which
began to take place when her students charged Spofford
with bewitching poor Lucretia Brown and she charged
the enemies of the faith with poisoning her husband by
the administration of mental arsenic. The beliefs narrated
both by her biographer and by Dickey are the logical
consummation of the beliefs which she taught. She raised
the mind to such heights that it became a Frankenstein
and destroyed her. By denying reality she brought into
existence a more horrible reality. She proved the truth
of Christian Science by her fear and tragedy as well as
by her cures and health. Even the weather irked her, Fry
reports, and she regarded snowfall as a manifestation of
mortal error. Yet after all, there was so little that could

really be done about
it,
though she charged her guards
to wage war against it. When her husband died, she
calmed her followers and silenced the world by the simple
statement, "I believe in God's supremacy over error, and
this gives me peace." Yet
it
did not give her peace; the
difficulty of maintaining the belief in God's supremacy
and the necessity of for ever resisting error, gave her hell.
However much her inward tranquillity may have been
disturbed just now, her church had begun to get gloriously
on its way. There were further hindrances, however, for
in 1888 thirty-six of the faithless deserted the cause, going
over to the heresy of New Thought. She managed this
crisis as she had managed all others, sent out more and
more practitioners, and enjoyed remarkable success in
demonstrating the truth of the cause. She laboured ear
nestly until 1895, when she retired from the world, stated
that she would have no more to do with the adjustment
of domestic or financial difficulties and from the quietness
of her home directed the great movement of her church
until her death in 19 10. This withdrawal only served to
heighten the adoration which her students felt for her,
and they insisted upon paying visits to her home. In most
cases they were rewarded only by the privilege of seeing
her start on her drives, but in 1903 she addressed ten
thousand pilgrims from her balcony.

heresy. She believed that healing must be accomplished
in accord with certain basic divine laws set forth for the
good of mankind in the holy words of Science and
Health, with Key to the Scriptures. Until the full and
insistent implications of her system are grasped, there is
no way to understand Christian Science.
She began by denying the reality of matter. In that she
was no neologist, but she went leagues farther than any
philosopher ever dared to go. She was an idealist with a
vengeance, and a religionist on top of it all. Everything
displeasing to her was erroneous —a postulate which she
was more than consistent in carrying out in all her think
ing and writing. Metaphysically stated, as the Christian
Scientist would say, that principle is as follows:
There is no life, truth, intelligence or substance in matter. All is in
finite mind and its infinite manifestations, for God is All-in-all. Spirit
is immortal truth ; matter is mortal error. Spirit is real and eternal ;
matter is unreal and temporal. Spirit is God and man His image and
likeness. Therefore man is not material ; he is spiritual.17
That may be cited as the kernel of the Christian Science
doctrine. It must be perfectly grasped before anyone can
cure gastritis or attempt to ward off mental poisoning.
The material universe and the physical body are mis
takes; we are as spiritual entities safely lost in a fathom
less sea of infinite and beneficent Mind, and if we but
rest our weary selves upon this realization, we become
spiritual and lose the sense of pain and error. Only as
we are egocentric and stiff-necked, exalting our bodies
and our puny ideas, do we come into the danger zone of
illness. "God is incorporeal, divine, supreme, infinite
Mind, Spirit, Soul, Principle, Life, Truth, Love." Mind
is the principle of the Universe; all that exists is infinite
Mind and its ideas. Man and the universe are simply
God's ideas. This is the cryptic meaning of the passage in
Genesis where it says that man is made in the image of
God. Since it is true that we are the image of God and
equally true that God is all that Mother Eddy says he
is,
it
follows without doubt that both the true mind and the

true universe are spiritual, eternal, perfect, expressing the
divine nature.
God is All-in-all.
God is good. Good is mind.
God, Spirit, being all, nothing is matter.
Life, God, omnipotent good, deny death, evil, sin, disease. Disease, sin,
evil, death, deny God, omnipotent good, Life.18
Apparently this is the syllogism which Mother Eddy
tried so hard to prevail upon Quimby to produce. It sum
marizes her argument in one monstrous affirmation, re
ducing the whole universe to a dilemma in its last words.
But in the dilemma which it presents, Mother Eddy finds
no difficulty. To let the affirmation in favour of evil stand
would of course be to fly in the face of reason and theol
ogy. Both affirmations are not true; she concludes: "Ac
cording to the Scripture, I find that God is true, 'but every
mortal man a liar.' "
That settles it. God is the only cause; therefore reality
must consist of God or Good. Evil, sin, sickness, and
death, being contrary to the nature of God, are simply
unreal. The presence of evil must be plausibly accounted
for if any religion is to seem profound. Now, to admit
that God is the origin of evil seemed to Mother Eddy
contrary to the facts of Holy Writ, rightly interpreted.
She rejected the Fall as insufficient to account for the
phenomenon. Now, God being not the cause of evil, it
must emanate from some other source, which is unthink
able, for such a concession would mean that there is in
the universe a strong power at loggerheads with God and
even temporarily supreme. Equally unthinkable. There
is,
by
a
process of eliminating the unthinkables, only one
conclusion left. There really isn't any evil, save as mortal
mind allows
it
to exist by unspiritual and fleshly think
ing.
In brief, Christian Science denies the old supernatural,
and teaches its followers themselves to become super
natural. It
is
entirely in accord with its postulates that
every man should overcome death as Jesus did. Just as

speakers today claim God as the first advertising man,
Adam as the first Rotarian, so the devotees of the Mother
cult long ago claimed Jesus as the first Scientist. He was
simply ahead of his day. Speaking before the World Re
ligious Conference at the Chicago Fair, D. K. Easton,
one of the early pastors who had imbibed the doctrine,
said this:
When Jesus came forth from the tomb, it was not because he had
supernatural assistance. He was only asserting the great fact of every
man's being, viz., that man cannot die.
He proved death a "false claimant." "The central
thought and efficiency of the resurrection is not the mere
rising of the physical body from a material grave." Nay,
rather:
Jesus in the silence and darkness of the tomb, aided only by his
demonstrated Scientific knowledge of the great facts of Life, Truth, and
Love, burst the bonds of death, unwrapped the winding sheet of ma
terial thought, and walked forth, conqueror over man's great en
emy. . . .
In short, "Jesus rose from the dead because he realized
that he had never died." Had he for one moment admitted
the reality of death "into his thought, he would have stood
powerless in the presence of the claim of death." And
therefore :
The ultimate ideal of Christian Science is to overcome death in the
same way that Jesus did, and when we follow His life perfectly, we
shall do it.19
If we forget for a moment the vigorous appeal which
Christian Science has made through its restorative power,
there is yet another factor to explain its success and glory.
I refer to the chance it gives every man to be a philos
opher and a scientist. In its ranks we behold the spectacle
of thousands of moderately informed persons being called
scientists and being regarded as metaphysicians. This fact
must not be underrated in considering the popularity of
Mrs. Eddy's system. It makes a subtle appeal. We breathe

208 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
an atmosphere of science today, and everyone has some
hankering to be a philosopher. Mrs. Eddy got her method
under weigh during the period when the first wave of
scientific thought struck these shores and when the result
of this wave threatened to be disastrous. The very term
"Christian Science" carries a theological wallop. It an
swers rather conclusively the charge of conflict between
science and religion by affirming that religion is science.
No modernist has been quite so adroit as Mother Eddy
in catching the popular imagination and desire with a
phrase —and what does it matter for the moment if the
phrase was borrowed? It was well borrowed, and it set
folks at ease as no other claptrap argument has done since
the days of Darwin.
To feel that one is a true Scientist and that all casual
experimentation outside the Church is of the devil, is
incredibly consoling. But I must emphasize the further
and equally potent fact: To say that one is a metaphysi
cian is flattering, for that posits, in the general public
mind, a dexterity and agility of mind which not every
one possesses. Ruth B. Ewing, in discussing "Spirit and
Matter" in 1893, said this:
True metaphysics, we believe, had not been discovered, practically
stated, and demonstrated, until set forth in the present age as Chris
tian Science. . . . Christian Science must needs embrace the state
ment of all truth to the exclusion of all error —if it is to substantiate its
claim to be thoroughly Christian and scientific.20
Consider the contributions which Christian Science has
made to religious thinking, the comfort which must ensue
from these contributions, and the secret of its success will
be perfectly clear. First, it restored healing to the shrine
and declared it to be of God; second, it asserted once
again that the Church possessed all truth to the exclusion
of all error —bolstering the claim with a new idea of
truth and a new idea of error; third, it offered its fol
lowers a minutely scientific interpretation of the Bible
20 Ruth B. Ewing, "Spirit and Matter." Address before World Parliament
of Religions, Chicago, 1983. These interpretations were offered in the good
old days before pastors were eliminated from the Christian Science organization
and the works of Mother Eddy made the sole instructors.

in an hour when the authority of the Good Book began
to be seriously undermined ; fourth, it made philosophers
and scientists of its followers at a time when those two
classes were most celebrated. Through its ample assist
ance, "men came into a scientific knowledge of God."
Its vast underpinnings of polysyllables gave a philosophic
support to religious optimism at a time when it was
sorely needed.
A sample of the polysyllablic philosophy of Christian
Science may be seen in what Mother Eddy did to the
Lord's prayer. As it stood it was hopelessly brief and un
scientific. Hence she filled it with spiritual meaning after
this fashion :
Our father: Mother God, all harmonious, Adorable One, Thy king
dom is come ; Thou art ever present. Enable us to know —as in heaven,
so on earth—God is omnipotent, supreme. Give us grace for today; feed
the famished affections ; and love is reflected in love ; and God leadeth
us not in temptation, but delivereth from sin, disease, and death. For
God is Infinite, all Power, all Life, Truth, Love, over all and All.
It is not surprising that a religion which sprang from
Mrs. Eddy should be given to amusing but logical ex
cesses. There is the case of Mrs. Josephine Curtis Wood-
bury, who gave birth in 1890 to a son whom followers be
lieved to be the result of an immaculate conception, in
perfect accord with Mrs. Eddy's theory of producing
life by mental generation. Mrs. Woodbury named the
child Prince of Peace and baptised it in a pool which she
named Bethesda. Mrs. Eddy promptly disowned Mrs.
Woodbury and her clique, and Mrs. Woodbury retaliated
by an attack upon Mrs. Eddy in the Arena of May, 1899.
In this attack she criticized the English of Science and
Health, satirized its author as the star-crowned woman of
the Apocalypse, and charged that she was a victim of
demonomania.
Or there is the case of Mrs. Augusta E. Stetson, who
has never for one moment relinquished her dizzy regard
for the sainted Mrs. Eddy, though she too was disowned
by the Mother Church. She went to New York when

210 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
Christian Science was practically unknown and built up
a powerful church from poor and unpromising begin
nings. Immediately headquarters became suspicious, and
when in 1908 she announced that she would erect a tem
ple which would "rival in beauty any other religious
structure in America," Mrs. Eddy became concerned lest
it transcend the Mother Church. In 1909 she was de
prived of her right to teach and practise and charged
with an attempt to "control and to injure persons by
mental means." Yet hear her estimate of Mother Eddy
as carried in a paid advertisement in the New York
Tribune for January 23, 192 1 :
Her earthly experience runs parallel with that of her Master; under
stood in a small degree only by the few who faintly see and accept the
truth, she stood during her earthly mission and now stands on the
mount of spiritual illumination toward whose heights no feet but those of
the blessed Master have so directly toiled, first in agony, and finally,
like Jesus Christ the masculine representative of the Fatherhood of
God, she as the feminine representative of the Motherhood of God,
will appear in triumphant demonstration of divine power and glory
as the combined ideal of man in God's image and likeness.
Unless it be for the purpose of restoring Mrs. Stetson
to favour, there seems to me little point in Mother Eddy's
return. She organized her works before she left in such a
manner that the Church can never forget her and never
depart from her decretals.
[Through the Christian Science Journal of 1895 she an
nounced without previous warning that there would be
no more preachers in the Church. She ordained the Bible
and Science and Health as "the Pastor, on this planet, of
all Churches of the Christian Science denomination." She
decreed that each Church should have a First and
Second Reader and that the sermon each Sunday should
consist of extracts read from the two sacred books men
tioned. No comments or explanatory remarks were per
mitted, and the possibility of any transcendent person who
might rise within the Church was cut off.
As early as 1893 the following ukase appeared in the
Christian Science Journal:

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE 211
I see no advantage and great disadvantage in one student's opinions
or modus operandi becoming the basis for all others; read Retrospection
on this subject. Science is absolute and best understood through the
study of my work and a daily Christian demonstration. It is material
ity that clogs the student's progress, and "this kind goeth not forth
but by prayer and fasting." It is materialism through which the animal
magnetizer preys and becomes a prey. Spirituality is the basis of all
true volition. Assembling themselves together and listening to each other
amicably, or contentiously, I have seen, is no aid to the student in
acquiring solid Christian Science. Experience, and above all obedience
are the tests of growth and understanding in Science.
That she should have a successor never entered her own
mind or that of her followers. As Mr. Alfred Farlow, her
press agent, put
it,
it
would be as impossible for anyone
to succeed Mrs. Eddy as
it
would "for an individual to
succeed Columbus as the discoverer of America." She left
a
Church which could never be changed. The by-laws
were given by God and cannot be amended without Mrs.
Eddy's consent. The directors, five in all, were appointed
with the approval of Mrs. Eddy; they hold their places
for life and name their successors. They elect all the of
ficers of the Mother Church and have control over all of
the branches.21 She established
a
press bureau to keep
down the ridicule which was rampant in the early nine
ties. She summoned Mr. Farlow to Boston; he was at that
time playing
a
bass horn in the brass band at Beatrice,
Nebraska, keeping
a
store, and manufacturing brooms on
the side. He had earlier proved himself worthy in the
building of the church at Kansas City. He came to Bos
ton, established an office, subscribed to
a
press clipping
bureau, began writing letters to the press in defence of
Christian Science, and within
a
short time had built up
the marvelous system of effective press control which has
made the committee on Publications famous.
Through her incomparable organization Mrs. Eddy's
books have been distributed. Certainly she never lost
a
chance to exploit the sale to the uttermost. In 1897 she
ordered everyone to give up teaching for
a
year and use
her books as the one source of authority. After the 1891

edition of Science and Health appeared anyone who used
the 1886 edition was regarded as living, spiritually, in the
dark ages. As Dr. Foster Eddy wrote concerning the 1891
edition:
Mother has never had time, until the last two years, to take the
numerous gems she has found in the deep mines of truth and polish
them on Heaven's emery wheel, arrange them in order, and give them
a setting so that all could behold and see their perfect purity. Now
here they are in this new revised edition of Science and Health.
By the time the 1891 edition was exhausted a hundred
and fifty thousand copies had been sold.
A fretful and domineering child of poor parents, given
to fits of temper, using big words with little comprehen
sion, dressing vainly and parading through her village
streets in ribbons and frills, marrying a bricklayer, giving
birth to a child who was later taken over by her sister,
living about from house to house, being rocked to sleep
by the hired man, marrying again —this time an itinerant
dentist who killed frogs in the nearby brook that she might
sleep undisturbed —suffering from chronic invalidism,
hearing of a travelling quack and studying his philosophy,
saving money from her allowance for the trip to see him,
studying both his methods and his writing and ideas sedu
lously and long into the night, roving about from place
to place, talking of Quimby, curing herself by the method
she had taught him, labouring hard with her first classes
and standing staunchly in the face of opposition, facing
lawsuits and heresies—all the while evolving an inspira
tion and writing a Bible which should exalt her to the
spiritual queenship of more than two million people.
In retrospection from the peaks of eminence the valley
through which she had passed took on a strangely tinted
afterglow, luminous with the events of a God-ordained
life. She never lost her sense of drama, and if drama was
lacking in the depressingly actual life she led during
her first sixty years, she supplied it without stint when
the hour of her triumph came. In her Message to the
Church in 1902 she says:

Six weeks I waited on God to suggest a name for the book 1 had been
writing. Its title, Science and Health, With Key to the Scriptures,
came to me in the silence of night, when the steadfast stars watched over
the world —when slumber had fled and I rose and recorded the hallowed
suggestion.
Who would be rude enough to deny her the pleasure
she got? When she left Lynn she was sixty-one years of
age and she had fewer than fifty followers, most of them
illiterate hands from neighbouring shoe factories. By
1896 there were four hundred churches and societies and
some thirty institutions for teaching. From 1890 to 1906,
according to Burton J. Hendrick, the membership of her
church increased 900 per cent. She began with the out
cast of the earth who could scarcely pay the rent and
ended with a spiritual corporation directed along lines
of unblemished efficiency by clubmen of prominence and
financial standing. That she should be greatly admired,
even among scoffers, is to be expected, for she did as
much as any other person to perpetuate the great Ameri
can tradition that anything is possible among us.

UNITY
In the centre of the United States rests an oracle of
iTruth which more than two million people consult each
year. Its priestesses are not hidden by vapours which issue
from the bowels of the earth but stationed in well ven
tilated shrines at a hundred and twenty-five typewriters,
before telephone switchboards and telegraph receiving
sets, in immediate touch with humanity and with the
infinite. It serves, not the overlords and kings of earth
with advice anent battles and catastrophes, but the dis
couraged, the unhappy, and all "who wish to grow more
prosperous and successful." Its answers are solicited on
such momentous questions as how to pass examinations,
how to acquire a mate, how to spiritualize the sex life;
and anyone who has a relative who insists on writing to
the oracle for advice on all matters of the heart and purse
will understand what an infectious influence it has upon
its entranced followers.
This modern and scientifically managed oracle does
business under the name of the Unity School of Chris
tianity. Like Christian Science, Shakerism and Theos-
ophy, it is the work of a woman —"a miracle wrought
by a woman's faith." Myrtle Fillmore, wife of Charles
Fillmore and part owner with him of the present munif
icent holdings of the order, has long been regarded as
the high priestess of Unity. Forty years ago the Fillmore
family lay in direst poverty; their status on the fast ex
panding American frontier was a sort of compound be
tween that of Job after the devastation sent upon him
by Jehovah and Mother Ann Lee after her husband ran

off with another woman. Mr. Fillmore—and I draw my
material from an account of the cult bearing the im
primatur of Unity headquarters—was maimed ; his wife
was suffering from what was in that day called consump
tion ; and three of his children were ailing. Furthermore,
he was at this time in abject poverty and "not a glimpse
of sunshine could be discerned in the heavens of the fu
ture." The father and husband had lost the power to
provide food and shelter for his family.
As a child, Charles Fillmore was a cripple from a hip
disease which had shortened his right leg. In addition,
he had curvature of the spine and was deaf in his right
ear. But he somehow grew up and married. Then his
wife contracted tuberculosis, and for six years the family,
with three children, lived in the states of Texas and
Colorado, hoping in the arid climate there to discover
the fountain of health. It was after a fruitless search that
they came to Kansas City, where Charles Fillmore en
tered the real estate business and became as successful as
the men one now reads about in the New Thought ad
vertisements. Within a short time he had amassed a hun
dred and fifty thousand dollars —no small sum for the
early eighties in the Middle West. But he had done it
while the town was on a boom, and when one of those
deflations which make American economic life so hazard
ous befell the citizens of Kansas, Charles Fillmore was
left without a penny. Hard upon the heels of this mis
fortune, as though God was testing him, the members of
the family fell ill again and the father found himself
unable to buy clothing or food or medicine for them.
Here is where Myrtle Fillmore comes in. Just when
the family was sunken to the lowest depths of gloom,
Myrtle became inspired. Just how is not quite clear. But
it is probable that, as so many in the New Thought
movement have done, she visualized prosperity and hap
piness. Suffice it to say that she got a new outlook on
life. She had, during the many months of adversity, rea
soned that there must be a supreme power "operating
upon a fixed divine law, and that this law, applied in
faith and faithfully, must of necessity set aside all nega

tive or destructive agencies" —such as real estate col
lapses, let us say. A perfectly normal conclusion for one
to reach who is buffeted by an unsound society and forced
through ill health into the humiliation that comes to
the unfit.
And yet the conclusion worked, just as it has worked
thousands of times since. The good woman's tuberculosis
vanished like a magician's rabbit, as did the ailments of
the children. Then she began treating her friends by the
methods of the new discovery. "Sickness and poverty be
came only as bad dreams. In their place health and ability
to work reigned. And Charles Fillmore, grasping the full
meaning of this divine law, began to help her in her
ministrations, reaping much benefit, physically, men
tally, and materially." *
Within a few months the whole
horizon of the Fillmores had shifted, giving rise to new
visions and new sunrises, and all because of the solemn
conclusions of the good wife and mother. These were
the modest and lowly beginnings of a religion which has
throughout the world today as many adherents as the
Methodist Episcopal Church, South.
Once the practicality of the woman's faith had been
demonstrated, Fillmore relinquished his hopes of ever
cleaning up again on real estate and in 1889, after three
years of experimental practice on friends, the two de
cided to devote their entire time to the practice of the
new faith which had fallen like the mantle of the
prophets upon their shoulders.
What should the good people name the work they
had started? That was the problem. During the eighties
the devotees of strange religions were by no means as glib
with words or as clever with advertising terminology as
they are today. So it was that Mrs. Eddy reports awak
ing from a dream in the middle of the night and writing
down by inspiration the stirring title for her book,
Science and Health, with a Key to the Scriptures. And
a name of similar resonance and beauty struck Mrs. Fill-
more as she lay musing one night upon what term would

symbolize their "sympathy for all movements helping in
the uplift of humanity." She thought of the word
"Unity," and it stuck. It suggests not only the oneness of
man and God, which is the prime postulate of the New
Thought, but also the solidarity of all religions, which is
the cardinal tenet of at least five of the modern faiths.
For Unity, it must be remembered, is "not a sect or a
church, but a school for investigating and demonstrating
the scientific principles taught by Jesus, and for giving
instructions regarding these principles." It does not teach
separation from the Church, but exhorts its followers to
introduce Truth into the Churches of which they are
members.
According to its own claims, Unity sprang into being
quite independently of all cults and with equal independ
ence reached maturity. But its stuff is too closely akin to
the stuff of Nautilus and Orison Swett Marden to be mis
taken in identity. It was undoubtedly joined by an umbil
ical cord to the New Thought, and sired by Christian
Science. Over in New England Mother Eddy had already
published several editions of Science and Health and I
suppose that the disciples of Christian Science can claim
that Mrs. Filmore heard the glad tidings from afar and
devised her own system on snatches of true Science which
she gathered, or that she had read a copy of Science and
Health. By the time Unity arose Mrs. Eddy had fairly
well demonstrated that she could cure disease by the
flatulent philosophy she taught, and Warren Felt Evans
had begun to give the world his commentaries on the
work of Quimby. It is obvious that the teaching of the
Fillmores partakes largely of both the unwieldly and
amorphous body of doctrine known as the New Thought
and the solidly contrived dogmas of Christian Science.
Yet it is equally obvious that each attained its abnormal
proportions without the aid of the other, for each was
destined through the shrewd foresight and happy insight
of its founder to amass wealth and build a colossal busi
ness organization on the reliable foundations of Ameri
can psychosis. Certainly Unity differs as much from
Christian Science as Christian Science from the faith of

Quimby. Myrtle Fillmore brought the twist of genius
to her task, and she lent grace and singularity to the enter
prise she launched. The result today is an organization
which bears nothing but a speculative historical connex
ion to the Mother Church in Boston and is comparable
to Christian Science only in the superb business general
ship of its founder.
Not the least difference between the policies instituted
by Mother Eddy and those of the Fillmores is brought
out in the decision which the pair reached shortly after
they began their works of grace: "If the power of God is
doing this healing and this work, then we have no right
to set a price upon it. So we are going to do this work
knowing that God will reward us." He has, abundantly.
And the Fillmore establishment maintains its policy to
this day, for a great part of the work done by its enor
mous plant at Kansas City is supported entirely by free
will offerings which grateful gout addicts and purged
converts send in from time to time.
The beginnings continued modest, even after Mrs.
Fillmore had thought of the happy name for the faith.
They began at once to print tracts, using a small com
posing room for the work and distributing the doctrine as
far as funds would allow. They began to issue a maga
zine called Modern Thought—now known as Unity
Magazine. Their work in those days was carried on un
der the name of the Unity Tract Society. And it was in
those days that the work of Silent Unity began, with the
aid of only one worker to help in absent healing. Now
the work accomplished by the Silent Unity branch alone
Requires the full time effort of more than sixty trained
^vorkers, answering letters, giving advice, offering pray
ers, and assisting in every possible way the immense ma
chinery of absent psychic healing which the Unity School
of Christianity has put on a modern business basis. Mrs.
Eddy prayed P. P. Quimby to come to her in his angel
form. That was terribly old fashioned, as we shall see
when we study the methods of this modern business or
ganization which cures thousands every year through
efficiency letters and circular advice.

One day the assembled saints, deeply aware of the far
flung possibilities of their tract society, decided to elect
twelve directors and to begin a campaign of expansion.
A building committee was appointed and a lot chosen at
a strategic point in the Gotham of the Middle West. One
penny—no more—was donated toward the completed
building, but that penny was solemnly and ceremoniously
blessed in the ramshackle temple which served Unity in
those days and it was not long until it had drawn thou
sands of other pennies to it and the faithful were able
to pay four hundred dollars down on the lot selected. A
small but adequate structure was erected ; the work be
gan to spread, and soon contributions were coming into
headquarters from every section of the state and from sur
rounding states though at no time was the cult highly
evangelical. "Each person who is helped by Unity passes
the news on to others," says Charles Fillmore. It was
only a short while before an adjoining lot was needed and
an architect, with commendable faith and foresight,
voluntarily drew the plans for a thoroughly up-to-date
plant which remained for a time the headquarters of the
School.
n
Prom its ardent but unimpressive beginnings Unity
has become in thirty years almost as great a feat as that
wrought by the hand of God in the six days of Genesis.
But with Unity there is no rest. Today there are more
than forty well-organized departments taking "the mes
sage of Truth to millions through the printed words."
There is a publishing department using more than forty
thousand feet of floor space, buttressed by a mail-opening,
an accounting, and a sales department. The literature of
the order is distributed by the sales department to more
than two thousand centres, classes, and dealers who are
selling "Unity literature direct to Truth students." In
addition, there is the department of the Silent- 70, or

the world in three decades. "Members of the Silent- 70

" They are to be
found in almost every city and hamlet, and their total
number was twelve thousand in 1927.
There is a subscription and order department in which
trained letter readers and a staff of experienced and con

correspondence which empties daily into the School
anent its publications and magazines. There is also a
special letter writing department which gives prompt
and courteous attention to all inquiries from every con

The School reports with pride that eighty-four hun

in outgoing mail and otherwise supervising the cult's im

The field department has for its motto, "A Unity Study
Class in Every Community."
We can catch some vision of the welcome accorded
the labours of these inspired tractarians when we know
that a thousand yearly subscriptions to Unity periodicals
are entered daily and that a number of the more grate

order. One of his records has to do with the Consecra
tion of the House and the catalogue of records asks : "Can
you imagine anything more desirable, were you moving
into a new home, than to have Charles Fillmore dedicate
it?" On record No. 401 the McDowell Sisters, "Sweet
hearts of the Air," sing "In The Garden," with stringed
instrument accompaniment. The records which come
from Unity studios have the advantages of being "flexible,
durable, and unbreakable."
There is of course a correspondence course, explaining
"the Jesus Christ teachings in clear language" and teach
ing "the student how to demonstrate metaphysical laws."
This department, like most of the others, conducts its la
bours gratis, and relies entirely upon the love offerings of
satisfied students. Unity has more than ten thousand cor
respondents in countries overseas. "Millions of other per
sons in foreign countries are awakening to Truth, but as
yet the actual demand is not sufficient to justify the print
ing of all our publications in foreign languages." The
work of foreign translation has begun, however, for some
of the publications have been printed in French, German,
Spanish, Italian, Swedish, and Norwegian. The physi
cally blind are not to be neglected. A fund has been
created for extensive work, and already the book Find'
ing The Christ is available in revised Braille.
The Unity School has its own broadcasting station,
with a 1000 watt transmitter and a wave length of 278
metres. More than sixteen hundred requests for healing
daily pour into the Silent Unity department—of which
we shall hear at delightful length in a moment. Unity
Vegetarian Inn, with a miniature theatre on the second

opportunity of getting a view and vision of this work."
The wealth of the order, controlled largely by the Fill-
mores, is something more than three millions of dollars.
So much for the vast and enviable organization with
which Unity does its work. It has not been my intention
to bore the reader statistically with this array of figures.
It would be misleading to tell first of the rigid control
which its doctrines, distributed by mail and by apostles
of Truth, exercise over the neurotic and unhappy men
and women of the land. For from an outside viewpoint
Unity is first and foremost, in its scheme and in its pur
poses, an organization of astounding efficiency; it has
reached and claimed its millions, not primarily because
of the odd teachings which it promulgates but because of
its unprecedented manner of promulgating them. It has
transformed the United States Mail into a missionary
machine. Having relied almost entirely upon the
shrewdly printed and ably distributed word for its enor
mous success, it offers to alarmed orthodox ministers the
best possible study if they are genuinely anxious to stop
the exodus from the churches to the isms. If any man will
look patiently at the work which Unity performs, with
its seventy-six hundred letters a day, its colossal broad
casting station, its twelve million publications a year, its
thoroughly capable prayer department, he will under
stand the methods by which effective religion today must
function. It
is,
in brief,
a
rhapsody in statistics, and there

Yet the fact remains that the Unity product has been

of her own accord if she dies at all. I know the worship
ful adoration which she holds for Unity literature and
the equal contempt which her husband holds. I know
also of another woman who will consult no physicians,
no merely Christian Science practitioner if her young
son falls ill. Rather she will write or wire the School of
Silent Unity and ask for immediate prayer and advice.
The same applies if she faces any serious financial prob
lem or domestic difficulty, and the curious and to her
convincing fact is that she has never yet been disap
pointed. With its many trunk lines leading to headquar
ters, Unity is able to announce that someone may be
reached any time of the day or night by telephone in
Kansas City, and many good cures have been effected
over the phone. Each month a Healing Thought is broad
cast by the order from its Kansas City citadel, and this is
supposed to be repeated over and over again during the
month; there is also a Prosperity Thought which will
bring opulence as surely as the Healing Thought will
bring health. Each month, too, there is published a small
booklet called Unity Daily Word, which contains some
choice morsel for every day of the year, prefaced by the
injunction, "Carry this thought with you!" and followed
by an elucidation. For June i, 1927, the daily thought
was, "I depend upon God, in his infinite justice, to ad
just and to harmonize all of my affairs." Part of the
exhortation which follows is in these words: "Injustice is
strictly a matter of personal consciousness and when we
are established in spiritual consciousness we are free from
injustice."
When we remember that thousands upon thousands of
salubrious suggestions are issued every month and that
there is great esprit de corps among Unity followers, we
see the immense effect wrought by mass thought and con
sciousness. Every day at noon and every evening at nine
o'clock, the widely scattered members of the School of
Silent Unity go apart into the silence and meditate hard
upon the Healing Thought, the Prosperity Thought and
the Golden Words sent out from Sinai.

new territory acquired fifteen miles out of Kansas City,
where Unity City is to be erected. The holdings now
comprise more than eleven hundred acres of unusually
fertile land, which nature has blessed with both gas and
oil in sufficient quantities to supply the needs of a large
organization. A dam is being built there to impound a
lake of some twenty acres, with seventy-five million gal
lons of water. The dam will cost a hundred thousand
dollars. Improvements on the farm up to the beginning
of 1927 represented an outlay of half a million dollars,
and the buildings to be erected during the present year
already involve an expenditure of a million and a half.
The purpose of Unity City is twofold. First, more
space is needed. The work has outgrown its present quar
ters. The press room and bindery are crowded. The office
desks are coming closer and closer together. Moreover,
Unity's eleven periodicals are growing rapidly in cir
culation, and with each new edition of books and les
sons, new material is added. More letters come in each
year than came before—and thousands of these letters are
requests for prayer. And "the farm seems to be the logical
place to carry on the enormous world-redeeming work
that Unity is doing."
The second reason is more important and more signif
icant in a study of cults. The scheme is to found in Unity
City a colony which shall be self-sustaining and united
in idealistic enterprise. Already there is an apartment
house on the grounds, to say nothing of a number of ar
tistic residences. When improvements have been com
pleted, the invitation will be offered to followers of the
Unity idea throughout the world to coagulate there and
demonstrate in one blessed and beatific community the
efficacy of Unity teaching. "Those who spiritually under
stand the truth taught by Jesus and who are able to ren
der needed assistance to the cause will be eligible to be
come residents at Unity City." The industrial activities
will be varied, the School announces, but the idea of an
economically autonomous community will be paramount
in all that is done. Says the prospectus recently issued by
the Trustees of the Unity School of Christianity:

The paramount ideal of Unity City will be the setting up, on earth,
of the kingdom of the heavens —the ideal of peace and harmony, pros
perity and health, to be established right here on earth. We look for
ward to the fulfillment of the vision of John given in the aist chapter
of Revelation.
Unity City shall be first, last, and always an educational city, a com
munity where all people will constantly be at school, learning more
each day about the law of God and the application of that law to
human affairs and broadcasting this knowledge to the world. It will
be a community school, inculcating spiritual, ethical and industrial
knowledge. All members of the city, regardless of age, will be pupils
of the school.
At present Unity City is simply regarded by the trust
ees as "the greatest Christian Service Station of the
American continent." And as the project gets started,
they ask for the following prayer on" the part of all true
followers, which should demonstrate, I believe, that they
have in mind something considerably above a mere ar
tisans' colony:
God bless Unity City. All activities of Unity City are in divine order.
Divine life inspires it and divine power protects it.
So history gets ready to repeat itself in a most melan
choly way. Not content with having built up the most
astonishing sales agency in the annals of religious enter
prise, the Fillmores now look eagerly to the time when
they can found another Utopia, to bring, as all Utopias
have hoped to do, the Kingdom of God to earth. The
students of contemporary society may watch with some
anxiety and interest the establishment of a community
which begins with as much wealth, prestige, and fore
sight as any that has ever been set up.
Until the ideal community is established we must con
tent ourselves with the feats performed by the present
organization. I have already alluded to the Healing
Thought sent out each month. For April 1926 this
thought was as follows: "Spiritual faith springs into my
consciousness and I am made whole and perfect." Cures
effected by these simple, soothing words are miraculous.
Indeed it would seem that any cure, however slight,

wrought by such methods, could properly be called amaz
ing.
The School of Silent Unity announces itself as "the
department of Unity that helps to bring our absent
friends into closer touch with the Holy Spirit. We can,
through the Holy Spirit, reach you in the remotest corner
of the world." Each month they send out this assurance
and command.
If you are sick the Holy Spirit will heal you ; if you are in financial
need, the Holy Spirit will show you the way to prosperity; if you are
unjustly treated the Holy Spirit will restore your own to you; if you are
unhappy, the Holy Spirit will adjust conditions and bring about har
mony. . . .
Silent Unity makes no charge for its services. If your need is urgent,
telegraph us; you may send a letter later. If you live in Kansas City,
telephone us at any hour of the day or night in case of urgent need, and
send a letter later. Be sure to give your full name and address. . . .
In response to this injunction, a regular avalanche of
letters descends upon the School each day telling how
the very thought of Unity has served as ample cause for
healing. One fellow perfected a decayed tooth by saying,
"I am God's child of perfection and nothing but per
fection can be manifest through me." That formula cured
one tooth. He later went into the silence and cured the
remainder, though they were all in an advanced stage of
decay when he wrote to Unity.
Whether there is a prayer department to which such
supplications are referred is never made entirely clear.
From what I can gather from the testimonials, the mere
swinging of the dumb-bells of concentrations upon high
ideals seems to turn the trick. For example :
When I wrote you about a week ago asking your prayers for my little
four-year-old daughter, she was suffering nearly all the time with some
stomach or bowel trouble which the doctors were unable to diagnose.
Twenty-five minutes after I mailed the letter to you, she was out play
ing—the first time in two weeks she had cared to play. She has been
perfectly well ever since.
A swifter cure of constipation is reported to have taken
place within two hours after mailing the coupon to Kan
sas City. Informed of this an unbelieving friend of mine

remarked: "That must be assigned to the cathartic quali
ties of the postage stamp."
"While washing I got my hand fast in an electric
wringer," writes another. "I declared the truth about
God's hands. The power went off and I took my hand out;
there was not a bone broken. I finished the washing and
did all the cleaning. My hand is not the least bit sore."
This power of Unity seems to operate in cases small as
well as large: "I have been wonderfully blessed by your
prayers. I have been healed of my hay fever. I thank
God and Unity." Apart from the testimonials recorded
in advertisements of yeast, I know of no such literature
of gratitude as we may find in the columns of Unity's
periodicals.
The Good Words Club is still another branch of the
order. It was organized in 1915 and now has more than
fifty thousand zealous members. Those joining this club
"pledge to guard their conversation against all negative
words and to speak words of trust, faith, truth, courage,
cheer, purity, peace, prosperity, praise, and joy." This
department also supplies its members with the "Good
Words Reminder Box, in which the user may place thank
offerings when he replaces negative words with good
ones." Each time the user employs a good word where
he was tempted to use a bad one, he is to deposit the thank
offering into the box, and at the end of each month he is
to send his thanksgiving to headquarters, where it is used
to progress the lordly work of purifying the conversation
and obliterating the evil suggestions which cloud the
horizon of latter-day man.
Unity supplies each convert and prospect with the
chance to buy at par its Prosperity Bank. The lofty pur
pose of this device is first "to help you realize your own
prosperity" and then to provide a "working basis for the
application of divine law to one's prosperity. It gives a
practical lesson in demonstrating the reality of the princi
ples of prosperity." A second purpose is that of bringing
the work of Unity to one's friends and thus pointing them
to a larger vision. And the third and obviously incidental
purpose is to enlarge the Unity subscription lists. For

the idea here is to fill the bank with enough coin in a
given period to send some publication or pamphlet of
the order to more prospects among the spiritual heathen.
The stuffed coffer is sent to Unity headquarters and one
thereby pays for the instruction of some benighted ac
quaintance in the secrets of Truth. Yet it must not be as
sumed that the owner of the bank is neglected by Unity.
As a matter of fact, along with the Bank "you receive
instructions in training your thoughts toward prosperity.
You will also be given prayers for your prosperity."
The teaching of the cult is too easily imagined to be
described at length. It has, however, evolved a philoso-
phism all its own. A subscriber to Unity Magazine de
livers himself of this characterization, which is later en
dorsed by the editor:
Unity seems to teach that the body is God and that you cannot be
sick, because your body, being God, cannot be sick. . . . Theologically
described, Unity is essentially materialistic pantheism.
And yet it outstrips Paulism in its Christian fervour.
The whole effort of the doctrine expounded by Unity is
directed toward making an outworn Christianity accept
able to unhappy Americans who would like to be physi
cally fit and financially sleek. It presents a complete and
positive denial of reality, glorying in the inequalities of
the present order because these merely give God the op
portunity that comes in man's extremity. It advertises for
and fairly longs to get at the victims of a heartless so
ciety and to teach them the sophistry that all unhappiness
and misfortune derive from the one failure to think
beautiful thoughts.
That is the practical content of its eminently practical
dogmas, but Unity thought never for one moment stops
there. It overreaches the lowly mark of prosperity and
sets for us a beatific state in which we can become Ameri
can yogis, with the whole of unfriendly nature at our
command. Its highblown view of bodily immortality

I should say, the hallmark of Unity. Reincarnation,
which the cult now teaches in its Kansas City meetings,
will cease when the followers of Unity have overcome
death, as they will in due time. Dr. Fillmore, speaking
through one of his many organs, has this to say of the
resurrection of Jesus :
Jesus raised his body to the fourth dimension. Every cell of his organ
ism became a purified monad. . . . He has prepared a place for us in
the heavens, the omnipresent ether.
All of us are one day to become actual Christs, with his
power of the resurrection. As Dr. Fillmore words it:
When we follow him in regeneration our bodies will not know death;
we shall become so spiritual that we shall live in the spiritual ether
with Jesus; this is the great and final resurrection.
In view of this guarantee of personal and bodily im
mortality through the mastery of Truth, those who have
paid their subscriptions to Unity periodicals for one hun
dred years in advance are merely expressing ordinary re
ligious faith.
Unity has always been deft to pick up popular terms
for its credo and has made liberal use of the catch phrases
of the new philosophy and the new psychology. In each
issue of Unity Magazine, the International Sunday
School Lesson is carefully outlined from the Unity point
of view. Every passage is interpreted symbolically.
Hence, Jerusalem is not a city; it "signifies the heart
centre of the individual consciousness." We are much
too simple when we regard Samaria as a land of gentiles,
for Samaria signifies the highest point of the intellectual
perception of Truth, or the department of objective con
sciousness that functions through the head." In one of
the lessons, this question is propounded: "Explain meta
physically Peter's preaching in Samaria." Answer: "It
symbolizes the faculty of power operating according to
its highest standards, in union with the inspired under
standing in the head, or objective consciousness, and
therefore operating most effectively." Peter was a fish

erman, and "a fisherman is symbolical of a consciousness
that is open to and seeking new ideas."
Thus it is that with much wind and high sales pressure
the Unity School of Christianity serves the multitudes.
It gets results. It offers a philosophism that sounds well
and works better. It has demonstrated its success through
the millions of adherents who have been swept into the
paper fold. Underpinning its vast machinery are of
course the cases in which it has cured disease of every sort
and its glib promise of physical immortality to its follow
ers. But the machinery in not to be despised. We have in
Unity an enormous mail order concern dispensing health
and happiness on the large scale of modern business en
terprise. It is mass production in religion and its work is
carried on shrewdly and systematically, with infinite
pains to capitalize upon the old demand and extend the
market. It is the work of a retired realtor and his inspired
wife, and with its tedious array of tabular facts and its
insufferable efficiency, it suggests pretty well what Ameri
cans want in the realm of the spirit.

XI
BAHAISM1
No cult bears a gospel better suited to the temper of
our times than the Bahai. Like all cults, it is not a cult.
"It is not a man-made movement," says one writer, "it is
the Cause of God." Having this distinctive feature, it
proclaims itself the fulfillment of "that which was but
partially revealed in previous dispensations," for its one
million adherents are convinced that "in Baha'u'llah,
according to his explicit text, the Message of God has
been revealed to mankind in its fullness and universality."
Buddha, Zoroaster, Jesus, Mohammed and Confucius
are not to be despised, for they played their trifling parts
in the preparation of the world for the Advent of the
"Most Great Peace." But every one of them, when all is
said and done, was but a voice crying in the wilderness.
It is to that last manifestation of God, Baha'u'llah, that
the world should pay final tribute: in him it will find
everything that the Christians all along have thought
they had in Jesus
—a solution to every perplexity which
confronts man here below. "Baha'u'llah bestowed upon
humanity a perfect model and criterion for truth, first,
in His own life, then in His written teachings."
Such is the belief and the messiah of Bahaism, a move
ment which has since the opening of the present century
swept the United States like influenza. In Bahaism we
have no neurotic appeal based upon thaumaturgy, but a
1 Reasonable consideration of the printer has prevented my using through
out this chapter the now recognized forms of spelling of the various names
used. For instance, Bahais is correctly written Baha'i s; Baha'u'llah is accented
Baha'u'llah . Except for the standardization given in the recently compiled
Bahai Yearbook (1926), I have been unable to find any two writers, even
within the sect, who spelled all the names alike.

quiet sect addressing itself purely to the social conscience
and intellectual spirit of the hour. Even so, its strides
have been enormous. On the shores of Lake Michigan
there stands—just the least bit abjectly, to be sure —a
monster temple to the Cause, not yet complete, but well
on the way, and for its constructions contributions had
been received, as early as 1910, from sixty American
cities. By now there is hardly an urban center where there
is not a Bahai center, and of the one million devotees
throughout the world, no small percentage are to be
found between the Atlantic and the Pacific. Its spiritual
assemblies have sprung into being like towns in the Texas
oil field, its literature in America is abundant and inform
ing, and it continues to go about its work in that quiet,
earnest way which is supposed to characterize the efforts
of anarchists and agents of Mexico in the United States.
This new religion is Mohammedan in parentage, and
in that respect differs from other Eastern faiths which
have in recent years sicced the hounds of heaven on the
materialistic heathen of western civilization. Its history
is so concentrated and eventful that its origins seem lost
in the corridors of antiquity, but as a matter of fact James
K. Polk had not yet taken the oath of office in America
when the John the Baptist of the faith arose in Persia.
On May 23, 1844, a radiant youth of Persia announced
himself as the Bab, which doesn't seem startling at all
to any American who knows nothing of the Shiite sect
of the Twelve Imams, of which Persia is the stronghold.
The Shiites believed that the Twelfth or last Imam never
really died, since it is unthinkable that the world should
be without an Imam. Hence the belief runs that he is
still living in the mysterious city of Jabalusa, surrounded
by faithful followers and at the end of time he will issue
forth and "fill the earth with justice after it has been
filled with iniquity." The last Imam disappeared from
mortal ken in A. H. 329 (A. D. 940-1), and for the first
sixty-nine years after his disappearance, there was com
munication between him and his earthly followers
through four successive intermediaries or gates —the last
one of whom refused to appoint a successor. It was not

until A. H. 1260 (A. D. 1844) that the Persian youth an
nounced himself as the Bab, or gate, and thus restored
the long suspended communion between the people and
the hidden Imam.
The story of the Bab is short and tragic. He aroused
the ire of the local clergy, was confined to prison and
martyred in 1850 at Tabriz.2 It was his function, accord
ing to the Bahai advocates, to "proclaim the coming of
the Mighty Educator, the One longed for by all peoples."
At any rate, he gathered a large following about him and
these suffered persecution as fierce as Mother Ann and
the Shaking Quakers endured in America fifty years be
fore. These followers were known as the Babis, naturally
enough, and would still be known by that name if it had
not been for the rise of the Mighty Educator. Here the
story grows at once confused and interesting, for the Ba
hai literature tells us that "Baha'u'llah took up the torch
after the Bab's death" and the "Babis movement was ful
filled in the Cause of Baha'u'llah." On the other hand,
Edward G. Browne tells us that "before his death the
Bab had nominated as his successor a lad named Mirza
iYaha." 8
Mirza was a half-brother of Baha'u'llah, thir
teen years his senior. In the fifth year of his Manifesta
tion, the Bab had heard of this youth, had taken a lik
ing to him, conferred upon him the title of Subh-i-Ezel
and made him head of spiritual affairs. He seemed not
particularly well suited to govern, however, and Baha
'u'llah early took over the practical affairs of the cult.
For the thirteen years Subh-i-Ezel was recognized as the
leader of the Babis, and upon the sudden declaration of
Baha'u'llah in 1863 that it was "He Whom God Shall
Manifest," internal strife arose among the Babis and
no small number of the faithful were killed in the com
2 Only a dire conspiracy of circumstances prevented the Bab's having a
miraculous delivery from this execution. He received a volley from the
firing squad and when the smoke had cleared away he had disappeared. The
theory generally given is that the bullets had cut the rope that bound the Bab
and left him uninjured. Had he escaped his religion would have been estab
lished by a miracle, but he was found a few momenti later, brought back, and
this time finished with a double volley. See Sir Percy Sykes, Persia, p. 128.

petition between the messiahs. From here on the Bahai
version of events has it that Subh-i-Ezel was a mere
blind and that it was Baha'u'llah the real Saviour all the
time. Subh, as the tabloids would call him, had two years
of purification for his work, in the judgment of his fol
lowers, but his enemies say he merely went off to sulk
because Baha'u'llah was in the ascendancy all the while.
Not all the Babis flocked to the standard of Baha'u'llah
upon his Manifestation, but his Cause gained rapidly
while that of Subh petered out. Rapidly the name Bahai
came into vogue to designate His followers.
Apparently higher criticism is not encouraged among
the Bahai and the story of its origins and relation to Babi-
ism remains the least bit vague. At any rate, we know
that Baha'u'llah became its Christ in 1863 and that, for
all practical purposes, He took up the torch after the
Bab's death. As befits a prophet, He spent the greater part
of forty years of His ministry in jail. He was in jail, as a
matter of fact, when He made His announcement, and
by it "the streams of Jewish and Christian prophecy
united with the inner reality of the Muslim Religion."
In 1868 He was taken to the Turkish prison town of Akka,
where He remained with His family until His ascension
in 1892. He was, significantly, a native of the City of
Noor (Light) and He began expounding the doctrine of
the Bab at the age of twenty-five in the City of Baghdad.
Disturbances arose and He left the city and remained
alone in the seclusion of the mountains of Sarklau, His
whereabouts unknown to all, until He returned to Bagh
dad and renewed His teachings. There He declared him
self for twelve successive days to His immediate follow
ers. He was driven by persecution first to Constantinople,
then to Adrianople, and then into the Holy Land to the
political prison of Akka, twenty miles from Nazareth
and nine miles from Mt. Carmel.
How did Baha'u'llah bring about so great a kingdom?
The answer is to be found largely in his letters, or tab
lets, as they are called in the hifalutin language of the
cult. In direst prison conditions he sent the glad tidings
to East and West that the day of God had dawned, that

a new and universal cycle had been established, "the age
of brotherhood, of peace, of the kingdom of God." This
Message, inscribed in tablets and epistles during the forty
years of his exile and imprisonment, was sent to kings
and rulers, to the prophets of the several religions, and
to his own followers in response to questions they had
addressed to him.
His tablets to the potentates of the earth met with
raried response.4 Queen Victoria, upon reading the tab
let, said: "If this be of God it will stand; if not there is
no harm done." The Czar sent a special embassy to con
fer with the Anointed One and upon hearing favour
able reports of the old man, Nicholas became "stirred
with visions of The Most Great Peace." The attitude of
other rulers was not so benign. The Pope met the edict
with scorn, whereupon Baha'u'llah sent His Holiness an
other, warning him that because of his arrogance he
would lose his temporal power. Presumably as a fulfill
ment of prophecy, the French troops were withdrawn
from the Vatican in 1870. Frederick III, crown prince
of Germany, was careless enough to ignore the tablet sent
to him and Baha'u'llah, not receiving so much as an ac
knowledgment, prophesied that he should never rule
over his country. Miss Isabella D. Brittingham observes
knowingly that Frederick was crowned on his sick bed
and died three months later without having ruled his
kingdom a day.
Here, as elsewhere, the fate of Baha'u'llah is depicted
as similar to that of Jesus and His announcement of the
Kingdom. Like the men summoned to the wedding feast,
the rulers began with one accord to make excuses. They
failed to heed the announcement of His Most Perfect
Presence, and somehow did not take seriously the assev
eration that "for the sake of His Eternal Love to His
Creatures He had turned His footsteps from the invisible
to the visible world, and veiled His Splendour in the
Body of the dust." Napoleon III, in fact, read the state
ment, saying, "If he is a god, I am two gods," but stu

dents of history know that this flippant monarch soon
met his downfall —an event appropriately prophesied by
JBaha'u'llah when he heard the emperor's retort.
The teaching of the Bahais derives both from the sa
cred tablets of Baha'u'llah and from the further doctrine
by his successor Abdul-Baha. Here again there is grave
need of explicit higher criticism, for Browne tells us
that a dispute of great bitterness arose over the accession
of Abdul-Baha and that the dispute was so extensive that
it affected the babes in the faith in America. Ibrahim
George Khayru'llah, who is credited with bearing the
message to these shores, championed the cause of Abdul-
Baha's rival and claims that his life was threatened as a
result. The last will and testament of Baha'u'llah was a
trifle ambiguous and it was difficult to determine, since
the whole thing was written in Oriental and figurative
language, which of his sons was meant to be his successor.
The Bahai tradition is never in doubt, however. It has
it that upon His ascension in 1892 he left a testament
naming Abdul-Baha as the Head of His Cause, the In
terpreter of His teachings and the Promulgator of His
Faith. Thus, "the providential spirit guiding and pro
tecting the Bahai Cause from the beginning, centred
thereafter in Abdul-Baha." 5
He served as "witness and
proof of Baha'u'llah from 1892 until November 28,
1
92 1." He was an adroit propagandist, travelling ex
tensively in Europe and America, lecturing constantly
on the tenets of the Cause, and writing more extensively.
In his writings the Bahais believe that "the ideals of
Christian, Jew and other religionist, of philosopher and
scientist, of economist and reformer, are abundantly
realized." He visited America during 1911-1913, speak
ing in thirty-three cities, and, according to the press ac
counts of the time, the churches of all denominations
were thrown open to him. Both the New York Telegram
and the New York Herald commented extravagantly
upon his message, declaring that, "unlike the leaders of so
many cults, he preached not the errors of the present re
ligions but their sameness." He was a man of executive

strength, and it is fairly certain that he gave the twist to
Bahaism which made it so attractive to the people of
the Western world. His writings were always benign,
grave, smooth, and full of soft platitudes and exalted
ethics. He offered this counsel in his will and testament :
Should other peoples and nations be unfaithful to you, show your
fidelity unto them, . . . should they poison your lives, sweeten their
souls; should they inflict a wound upon you, be a salve to their sores.
Such are the attributes of the sincere 1
8
As was inevitable, Abdul-Baha was often choked upon
the incense of adoration. His every act conveyed, in the
judgment of his followers, some grave and astounding
significance. Also, he possessed a ruddy strain of mys
ticism, which lent currency to the mystical importance of
his acts. Shoghi Effendi, whom he appointed first Guard
ian of the Cause (he was his eldest grandson), tells in
words dripping with sentimentality of Abdul-Baha's
last days on earth. The whole narrative rivals a modern;
minister's overdrawn and dramatized account of the Pas
sion Week. Shoghi tells us that the old prophet refused
to give intelligence of his approaching death even to
the immediate members of the family and that he some
how lowered a veil upon their minds which prevented
their properly interpreting dreams preceding the last
hour. Abdul-Baha said, a few days before the end, "I
dreamed a dream and behold the Blessed Beauty [Baha-
Vllah] came and said to me, "Destroy this room!" Now
the family mistakenly supposed that this dream injunc
tion was a message to give up sleeping out of doors in
the garden and to come into the house. It was nothing of
the sort. Shoghi Effendi says: "Afterwards we under
stood that by room was meant the temple of the body."
Moreover, Abdul-Baha is assumed to have had almost
as much to do with the origins of Bahaism as Baha'u'llah.
Thornton Chase, in his book, The Bahal Revelation,
points out that Abdul was born the very hour that the
Bab was uttering his declaration and that "the declara
tion of the Bab and the birth of Abbas Effendi [Abdul

Baha] in different parts of the kingdom of Persia at the
same time were Forewords of the coming Revelation."
Mr. Chase further sees appropriate meaning in the in
vention of the telegraph about this time, for: "The dec
laration of telegraphic success in the words, 'What God
hath wrought,' flashing out in America on the morning
of May 24th, 1844, was the material response and fore
word of the new earth to be created for the physical wel
fare of man in the millennial age about to appear. The
spiritual proclamation came from the East, the material
answer from the West."
Thus the stars in their courses favoured Abdul-Baha
throughout his days. The telegraph was his star of Beth
lehem. His utterances, as I have said, resound with plati
tudes and lofty injunctions which reverberate like dis
tant thunder:
The corner stone of the religion of God is the acquisition of the Divine
perfection and the sharing of His manifold bestowals. The essential
purpose of Faith and Belief is to ennoble the inner being of man with
the outpourings of grace from on high. If this be not attained, it is in
deed deprivation itself. It is the torment of infernal fire.T
The worst hell, it seems, that Abdul-Baha can think of
is not to have the inner being ennobled. He offers his
followers little save mental peace and equilibrium, de
claring that all these things must be tenderly pondered
among the Bahai, "that, unlike other religions, they may
not content themselves with the noise, the clamour, the
hollowness of religious doctrine. . . . They should jus
tify their claim to be Bahai by deeds and not by name."
Thus we appear to have in Bahaism a faith which
transcends all others. It takes the best of all and brews
synthetic faith for modern man. Miss Brittingham, to
whose book I have already alluded, believes that the
Revelation of Baha'u'llah "is the Revelation which rights
all wrong . . . for it comes from the world which rights
the wrongs of this one." The beliefs and practices of the
cult parallel those of Christianity, yet excel them. Baha
'u'llah, for example, showed remarkable metaphysical

aptitude at an early age, and even as a boy he would
often astound the learned men with whom he talked. He
was the child in the temple many times, giving clear and
devastating answers to the most puzzling questions that
the Pharisees of Persia could propound. He fulfills all
prophecy, even some of those which are supposed to
apply to Christ. For instance, take the prophecy in
Isaiah 9:6:
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government
shall be upon His shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful,
Counsellor, The mighty God, the everlasting Father, The Prince of
Peace.
Now "many misguided people," says Miss Britting-
ham, "ignorant of the symbolic language used in the sa
cred writings, have confounded this passage with the
Prophecies relating to the coming of Christ." But Miss
Brittingham interprets the passage to mean that Christ
declared the prophecy in Isaiah to refer to One who
should come after Him. And that One, is of course Baha-
'u'llah. So it is that the servants of Baha'u'llah are in these
latter days but "cup bearers of the Divine Knowledge to
all." Bahaism is "not a new Faith, but faith renewed;
not a new Light but Light restored. It is truth rescued
from the scaffold and placed upon the throne."
What is truth? another jesting Pilate might ask, and
he would lose nothing if he did not stay for. an answer.
Truth seems to be the essence which rises above the kettle
in which the Bahaist doctrines boil. It is not exactly those
doctrines, for Bahaism, like theosophy, Liberal Catholi
cism, and the New Thought, enforces no dogmas and of
fers no superstition to its worshippers. Its teachings are
in perfect accord with science. Truth, then, like God, is
a spirit. "No man," says Abdul-Baha, "should follow
blindly his ancestors and forefathers. Nay, each must see
with his own eyes, hear with his own ears, and investi
gate Truth in order that he may find Truth."
Religion must agree perfectly with science —so per
fectly that religion shall sanction science, and science re
ligion.

240 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
II
It will be evident from these stated principles how
closely allied with the temper of our present mind is the
cause of Bahaism. Yet this is not by accident, nor are we
to suppose that the Bahai have merely taken advantage
of advanced movements and hung their doctrines upon
popular beliefs. The very opposite is true. The Zeitgeist
itself is the fulfillment of prophecy. Carl Scheffler, who
has had much to do with the erection of the Bahai Tem
ple at Chicago, asserts that "the progressive movements
which have sprung up during the Nineteenth Century
have been the instruments of God to make the world re
ceptive to His Cause." Indeed the world has "advanced
so far toward the Bahai teachings that we should not be
in the least astonished if from now on the people join the
Cause in whole groups rather than as isolated individ
uals." The sign of triumph is night for as someone has
aptly said, "If the Bahais do not make the world Bahai,
jt will, through its own natural development, become so."
The Bahai Year Book for 1926 declares that "the
rapidly altering character of human life throughout the
world is one of the proofs of the Mission of Baha'u'llah."
All great changes of the last eighty years are attributable
to the presence of some "Influence felt in the very soul of
the world." The history of the Bahai cause is the ex
planation of that influence.
It is more than an incident in history. It is clear Light illuminating
the spiritual powers to which people consciously or unconsciously now re
spond. Apart from the Bahai cause, modern world movements and ten
dencies seem sinister anarchy; but from within the Cause they assume
perfect order and fullness of meaning.8
The Bahai believe that religion in each cycle discloses
a new aspect of truth. Baha'u'llah had the advantage over
Jesus, in that he was not prevented from giving His full
message. "The written text surviving Him guides the
faithful follower into all truth." From His teachings we
derive "science, philosophy and teachings on economic

and governmental problems, as well as ethics and meth
ods of spiritual purification and attainment." The result
is that every blessing which may befall us today is prob
ably, however remotely, connected with the Prophet
Baha'u'llah. Mr. Charles Mason Remy, another Chicago
Bahai, in his book Bahai Teaching, announces that Baha
'u'llah antedated the League of Nations by fifty years,
for:
About fifty years ago in the book of Akdas, Baha'u'llah commanded
the people to establish universal peace and summoned all the nations to
the Divine Banquet of International Arbitration so that questions of
boundaries, of national honor and property, and of vital interests between
nations might be decided by an arbitral court of justice.*
That the Bahai have stood steadfastly for the cause
of international peace cannot be denied. But so have the
Shakers and the Quakers. What they have done is not
so absurd as the reasons they give for doing it. The be
lief prevails that Baha'u'llah has come to consummate
all liberal opinion and all exemplary conduct. His peo
ple and His alone are responsible for the progress of our.
day, and, this being the case, then anything which hap
pens is just as likely as not to be the product of Baha
'u'llah. Possibly Mr. Remy has not read "Locksley Hall,"
or studied the life of the Buddhist King Asoka, or read
the sacred tablets of another Prophet and Teacher, Gau
tama Buddha, or studied with any care the pacifistic
principles of the Carpenter. Bahaism lays claim to all
sorts of achievements which are most probably the work
of the devil—achievements assignable to the triumph of
Bahaism only by the queer reasoning that, since Bahaism
happened to be in the world at the same time, it must be
responsible.
Hear again the voice from the National Spiritual As
sembly of America, speaking through the latest Bahai
Year Book:
That spiritual power has been breathed into the soul of humanity
in this age which shall remove all causes of difference, misunderstanding,
discord, and disagreement —causes resident in customs and institutions

as well as in personal opinions and emotions —and establish the means
and methods as well as the desire of unity —is the essence of the Bahai
teaching and faith.10
Whatever may be accomplished by means of the
Church Peace Union or the Young Man's Christian As
sociation may thus be taken as the fulfillment of Bahai
prophecy. Indeed it should encourage the brothers and
sisters in the faith to know how many infidel agencies are
labouring sedulously for Bahai ends.
Not that the Bahai proselyte or claim sole credit for
the world's advancement toward Almighty God. Rather
they claim one distinctive doctrine, and one alone. That
is the oneness of mankind. Overlooking for a moment the
fact that theosophy claims the doctrine equally, with a
generous extension of it to include the animal world as
well, we find in the cult an inclusiveness and beneficence
which the Southern Baptists would do well to emulate.
"Baha'u'llah submerged all mankind in the Sea of Divine
Generosity." He declared that "all are leaves of one tree,
flowers in one garden." He taught that all religions are
one in their fundamental principles, and that religion
must be a cause of love and harmony, for otherwise it is
no religion at all. He insisted upon universal peace and
international arbitration, upon compulsory education,
especially for girls, and equal rights among the sexes. He
set forth the need of a universal language looking toward
world unity, and in Esperanto his followers have of late
seen again the fulfillment of His prophecies.

The story of the Bahai in America is the story of
Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, the quaint name given to the temple
of all nations which the Bahai have been sedulously try
ing to build in Chicago since 1902. As I have indicated,
the movement came to these shores through the good of
fices of Ibrahim George Khayaru'llah, who married an

West with the Gospel of the Orient. He lectured on the
subject of Bahaism in Chicago as early as 1892, made
other excursions about the land at later dates, and finally
became a natralized citizen of the United States. Chicago
has for ever after been the fortress of the cult in America,
though New York rivals the Windy City, and the rivalry
between the two bodies of love-worshippers has at times
been sharp enough to draw the warning of Abdul-Baha
and later of the spiritual Guardian of the Faith.
It must be said to the credit of Chicagoans, however,
that they hit first upon the idea of erecting an immense
tabernacle and ark of the covenant on American soil. It
all began when the Chicago adherents heard of the first
Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in Russia. Members of the spiritual
committee at Chicago, better known as the House of
Spirituality of the Chicago Association, were inspired
to "supplicate the Centre of the Covenant, Abdul-Baha"
to grant permission for the second Mashriqu'l-Adhkar
to be built in America. Supplication was accordingly
made, whereupon Abdul-Baha pondered the matter for
a while, then on June 7, 1903, a tablet was revealed to
him in Acca, saying,
Now the day has arrived in which the Edifice of God, the Divine
Sanctuary, the Spiritual Temple, shall be erected in America.11
From the time this tablet was revealed to him, Abdul-
Baha became an earnest advocate of the enterprise. In
deed he expressed himself so repeatedly and monot
onously on the subject that his whole conduct resembles
that of a small town Oklahoma minister urging his
board of deacons to erect a new Baptist Church. New
[Yorkers, naturally enough, raised a divine stink when
they heard of the possible enterprise in Chicago, where
upon Abdul-Baha revealed another tablet, exhorting the
maidens of the Lord in Gotham to refrain from protest,
since the maidens at Chicago had first gotten the idea
and begun the structure. He consoled the New Yorkers
with the promise that in the future a temple would be
erected in every state, with "infinite architectural beauty

and art, with pleasing proportions and handsome and
attractive appearances, especially in New York."
That is one prophecy of the faith that has not yet been
fulfilled, but Abdul-Baha, executive that he was, real
ized all too well the necessity of centring the attention
of the converts upon one central spot. Thus he issued
messages of love and bore upon all the tremendous im
portance of the project at Chicago.
In his mind there seemed to attach something of the
mystical importance to the erection of the edifice that
attaches to the gelatin Cathedral which Bishop Lead-
beater of the Liberal Catholics says is erected above the
Church during the performance of the Eucharist.
Though his writings and conversations indicate this, the
suspicion aroused in my mind every time has been that
he was American enough to use spiritual appeals for put
ting over a great project of practical consequence. To
Mrs. Helen S. Goodell and Mrs. Ella G. Cooper, both
of Chicago, he said :
To have it built is most important. Some material things have a
spiritual effect, and the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is a material thing that will
have a great effect upon the spirit of the people. Not only does the
building of Mashriqu'l-Adhkar have an effect upon those who build
it,
upon the whole world.12
On another occasion he said to followers who called
to see him in the sanctuary at Acca that the building of
the temple would have "a tremendous effect upon civil
ization." While in Egypt Abdul-Baha assured Mr. Percy
Woodcock, also of Chicago, that
The most important thing in this day
is
the speedy erection of the
edifice. Its mystery
is
great and cannot be unveiled as yet. In the future
it
will be made plain.
When he visited Chicago in 191
2,
Abdul-Baha walked
to the Holy Hill where the committee had previously de
cided to locate the temple, and there placed
a
common
stone in what he calculated would be the centre of the
edifice. According to the architects, this stone will have

to be moved, but its place has been carefully marked and
around it will be raised an appropriate shrine when the
whole affair is complete.
It should be evident from the foregoing, and was in
deed evident to the followers in Chicago, that their idea
was blessed of God and that the enterprise could un
doubtedly be accomplished. Writing in The Bahai Year
Book, Mrs. Corrinne True concludes that "it is manifest
that Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is founded on the Rock of Ages,
the eternal Word of God, as to its object, location and
appropriate time for its erection." Nothing remained
then but to get the thing under weigh. Several good tracts
of land were selected and the business of finding the
choicest spot was at once begun.
The selection of the site was facilitated by one thing
—Abdul-Baha had said that the temple must overlook
the shores of a lake. It was necessary, then, to look only
on the shores of Lake Michigan. The first convention for
the business of the temple was assembled in November,
1907. During the course of the convention various plots
were considered, a feast served by the Chicago maid
servants, as the good ladies of the Cause are called, and
the decision made to take fourteen appropriate lots.
Funds being low, only two of these were bought, but an
option was secured on the remainder. The temple was
to be located in Wilmette, a suburb of Chicago, and when
completed its towering light, signalizing the unity of all
the faiths of mankind, was to shine from its lofty tower
out over the waters of Lake Michigan.
Abdul-Baha, seeing that the maidservants were really
in earnest, gave his fullest co-operation. He has said,
"You have only to begin—everything will be all right."
So, having begun, the assumption prevailed that every
thing would be all right. On Emancipation Day, 1908,
a tablet was revealed by Abdul-Baha and translated by
his daughter, Monevah Khanum, in which the following
was expressed.
Ask every spiritual meeting in the other cities that they will select one
and send him, and with these selected ones and those selected from the
Chicago meetings, establish a new meeting for the provision of means

of the temple. If this is established with perfect fragrance and joy, it
will produce great results. In this new meeting, especially for the estab
lishment of the temple, women are also to be members.13
Whether the meeting was established in perfect fra
grance and joy is not at all certain, since the edifice is not
yet complete and since some of the Bahai have com
plained that in its present state it resembles a Shaker vil
lage of the late nineties. In making his report in 1925,
Mr. Carl Scheffler said that the temple in its present
state —only the basement is completed and the first floor
exterior —had aroused some adverse comment. He goes
on to remark anent fragrance that "this is probably a con
tinuation of the opposition which was in evidence when
the work was started."
But whatever the present difficulties, they were not
foreseen by the Bahai when the temple was begun. For
had not the Servant of God assured them that, once hav
ing begun, everything would be all right? Another meet
ing, in response to the injunction of the sacred tablet, was
held in 1909, when a corporation was formed under the
name of the Bahai Temple Unity and the contract drawn
for the remaining lots. At that time there was approxi
mately four thousand dollars on hand and the land values
amounted to two thousand dollars. It seemed most prob
able that this modern answer to the tower of Babel, this
symbol which would undo the confusion of tongues and
spread oil upon the world's troubled waters, would surely
succeed. By 1910, things looked still better. Contributions
were received from India, Persia, Turkey, Syria, Pales
tine, Russia, Egypt, Germany, France, England, Canada,
Mexico, and from a little island out in the Indian Ocean,
Mauretius. In addition stipends had come from at least
sixty cities in the United States. Abdul-Baha himself con
tributed in a material way, though I have been unable to
find from the record just how much he gave.
The year 1913 was good and the indebtedness was taken
from the land. After that deterioration set in. In 1920
the Centre of the Covenant admonished his subjects, tell-

ing them that what they had planned was far too ambi
tious and that the cost of it ought to be reduced. Action
was taken and the estimated expenditures brought down
from an indefinite number of millions—to one million
two hundred thousand dollars. This estimate, however,
does not include the interior work, which, being sym
bolical, will be elaborate. The diameter was reduced from
450 to 153 feet. Once a reduction had been made, it was
assumed that everything would be all right.
But still the temple stands, and still it fails to have
a tremendous effect upon civilization. Its plan, however,
is good. It stands as I have said, for the unity of faith
throughout the world, and though only the words of
BahaVllah are to be read therein, its architecture is
designed to embrace and unify the beliefs of mankind.
It was decided that the most used of the nine entrances
of Mashriqu'l-Adhkar should face toward Acca, the
Mecca of Bahaism, for it was there that BahaVllah spent
his inspired years in the misery of a Turkish prison camp
and it was there that Abdul-Baha established himself to
receive pilgrimages. In order to establish accurately the
position and orientation of the most used door, that it
might face the Most Great Peace, astronomical observa
tions were made to establish the true meridian through
the centre of the Temple.
The whole scheme of the Temple has been ingeniously
worked out to symbolize and embody the Bahai revela
tion. It is claimed to be a house of worship and devotion
open to all the people of all the religions of the world,
to all races and classes without distinction of creed or
colour. Its services are or were to consist of the reading
and chanting of the Most Holy Word of BahaVllah. The
main section is to be surrounded by "accessory buildings
of humanitarian intent, and the relation of all these
buildings one with another and with the central edifice
discloses the relation of organic functions of society with
the spirit of religion."
Miss Mary Hanford Ford has been good enough to
elucidate the architectural symbolism of the temple in
spirited detail. She tells us that it is a perfect nonagan,

with nine doors, nine ribs in the dome, and nine open
ings on each side. In fact all the dimensional numbers
of the temple are related to nine, for nine is the sacred
number of Bahaism. In fact the figure nine is actually
formed, she tells us of the word Baha, the Glory, because
in Arabic, letters are numerical symbols also. B is 2, A is
i, H is 5, and A is i again, and "the consensus of all
makes nine."
So the nine doors of the temple symbolize the perfect number of paths
to God, and thus unity in the Glory of Baha, and the prevalence of 9
in the numerical structure of the temple creates heavenly unity in its
.vibration.
Multiples of nine are just as important, for Miss Ford
has observed that "there are nine openings on each of the
nine sides of the temple on the first and second stories,
producing the number 81 or spiritually nine." There
are also three small doors on each side of the third story,
"making 27, or again nine." There are nine columns on
the first story, nine buttress ornaments on the second, nine
ribs to the great dome, "so that one can never escape the
heavenly presence of nine." And since nine represents the
number of perfection, the temple "becomes the emblem
of perfection more definitely exemplified in the Bahai
teaching than ever before."
And we have the words of Abdul-Baha himself to the
effect that there is something distinct and mystical about
Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. He proclaimed that
Verily the founding of it will mark the inception of the Kingdom
of God on earth. It is the evident standard waving in the centre of the
American continent.

off from all others
:
Think not that this temple will be like the hundred thousand gigantic
temples you see about you. Know ye [heralds Abdul-Baha] that when
the Temple of God shall be built in Chicago
it
will be to the spiritual
body of the world what the inrush of the spirit

of man, quickening it to the utmost parts and infusing New Light and
Power.1*
Here, as in the liturgy of the Liberal Catholics, we
have the obvious effort to erect trapeze upon which the
angels of the spirit world can do their work, this same
machinery for the inflow of divine power from on high.
But the eucharistic edifice of Bishop Leadbeater is safer,
for it cannot be seen, save by those who have the keenest
possible spiritual vision, while the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar
of the Bahai at Chicago becomes a symbol of earthli-
ness and futility, if as the symbol of the kingdom, it does
not reach to the skies.
IV
The government of the Cause of God is as practical
and divinely instituted as that of the first Judges of
Israel. To assist the Guardian of the Cause in his mani
fold duties and responsibilities, and particularly in the
promotion of teaching work, Abdul-Baha provided for
the group of co-workers to be known as the "hands of
the Cause of God." There are, curiously, nine of these,
and they are perpetuated by the appointment of the
Guardian, with the consent and judgment of the Hands
of the Cause of God already functioning. The respon
sibility for and supervision of the local Bahai affairs is
vested in each town in a body known as the Spiritual As
sembly. This body, which is limited to nine members, is
elected on the first day of the Festival of Ridvan, and
concerning its character and functions, Abdul-Baha has
written as follows:
It is incumbent upon everyone [every believer] not to take any step
[of Bahai activity] without consulting the Spiritual Assembly, and
they must assuredly obey with heart and soul its bidding and be submis
sive unto
it,
that things may be properly ordered and well arranged.
Otherwise every person will act independently and after his own judg
ment, will follow his own desire and do great harm to the Cause.18

The prime requisites which he lays down as necessary
when they take counsel together are
purity of motive, radiance of spirit, detachment from all else save God,
attraction to His divine fragrances, humility and lowliness among his
loved ones, patience and long-suffering in difficulties, and servitude to
His exalted threshold.
There is a National Spiritual Assembly for America
and the various enlightened lands where the Cause of
the Most Great Peace has already spread. There are also
elaborate plans on foot for the formation of an Inter
national Spiritual Assembly, "which God hath ordained
as the source of all Good and freedom from error." It
must be elected by "universal suffrage, that
is,
by believ
ers." This, when formed, "enacteth all ordinances and
regulations which are not to be found in the explicit
Holy Text."
Horace Holley, who speaks frequently in New York
on subjects of interest to the Bahai, sees in this method of
government
a
completely "successful reconciliation of
the usually opposed claims of democratic freedom and
unanswerable authority." There
is,
he points out, no hired
clergy and no internal factionalism. In the Bahai cause
we are actually witnessing the fulfillment of that strange
and cryptic saying, "The meek shall inherit the earth."
Not only are the prophecies of the Cause itself fulfilled.
For good measure,
it
fulfills the prophecies of all other
faiths.

XII
KU KLUXISM
WHEN the Klan last lifted its ugly head to the con
sternation of American liberals, it was variously con
demned and derided. Long essays were written to show
that it bred racial hatred, others to show that it hoisted
the flag of rebellion and the insignia of a super-state, and
still others to labor the obvious fact that it was prompted
by the avarice of a few and that it fed upon the com
mercial gain of many. The New York World, relying
for its information very largely upon an apostate Captain
Fry, who had stood high in the councils of the holy order,
conducted one of its courageous investigations, and the
substance of its findings was that the Klan was a menace.
Congress undertook one of its feeble inquiries, and of
course got nowhere.
But all the writers of that hysterical hour, with one or
two notable exceptions, failed to see what in this later
day has become a fact of first importance and no dispute,
namely, that the Klan was a religion. It was the religion
of the war-time mind, the vehicle by which the intensi
fied emotions of the war period expressed themselves in
America. Its psychology was fundamentally religious
and it required no adroit use of the documents to show as
much. That it had its commercial aspect is true, but that
aspect was no more important and certainly no more
nearly an explanation than the commercial aspect in any
religious organization. The higher-ups can make no
money out of a religion unless the lower-downs believe in
it. It offered a source of revenue, to be sure, but only
because it could capitalize certain imponderables.

252 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
It was political, I grant, but only as the Methodist
Church is political. For it was not by accident that the
Church and the Klan were so closely allied in every ham
let and crossroad. The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
made a creed of Americanism, and transformed political
ideas into religious dogmas; it transmuted what com
monly passes for politics into religion of the most frantic
and frenzied sort. Under its reign we became a chosen
people, led of God for the salvation of humanity and
appointed to do a thing the Jews had failed singularly
to do two thousand years ago.
Of these facts there can be no doubt as the study of the
record proceeds. For America the war ended much too
soon. We were avid for blood as early as 191 6, we en
tered and began to perform the ritual of hate as early as
1917, and after that the war was never more than a
ritual to us. We never felt its reality. We had all the joys
of war with none of its unsavoury details. It remained a
yague and far-off drama to the vast majority of us, who
spent our time selling thrift stamps before large gather
ings of people or laying our sons upon the altar in the
manner of Abraham. It was all a rather weird and unreal
performance. We never saw the enemy; everything was
impersonal; we were told that a certain amount of our
money would kill a certain number of Germans, but the
process of killing by such indirect means was extremely
unhealthy and unsatisfying. We lived in a world of fancy,
of an imagined terror, of a distant and inhuman enemy
engaged in a conspiracy to upset our homes and wreck
the virtue of our womanhood. We grew psychopatholog-
ical in our suspicions and were ready to pounce heavily
upon the stolid German farmer if he did not renounce
his fatherland and take up the cause against these mon
sters who sought to destroy us. We wrestled, not against
flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers
of the air, and against the rulers of darkness.
It was a drama of complete unreality in which the
greater part of our hundred millions of more or less pa
triotic souls participated. The Klan could never have

risen in France, for France tasted the dregs of the cup ;
there was no romance and vagueness in her hatred. With
us it was different. I recall quite vividly my own experi
ences, which were, I regret to say, typical of the most of
my young fellow Americans. I was too young for actual
service in the camps, but I was old enough to make
speeches for Liberty Bonds and War Savings Stamps.
I traversed the country, pleading with people to give
their all. The War was fought out for me in the daily
press and on the scoreboard which the Rexall Drug Com
pany had been good enough to erect in its show window.
Standing on the walk outside, I could inhale the aroma
of the fountain —that always gave me a sense of luxury
and peace—and at the same time see the manner in which
millions of men tugged back and forth across the minia
ture battlefields of France.
The psychology resulting from absentee participation
cannot be studied too closely. We were never in the War,
except vicariously. We had seats at the back of the arena
and we consoled ourselves that these cost us a lot of
money. All of our emotions went into the air ; our hatred
found nothing upon which to vent itself during the ac
tual conflict —with the lamentable exception of a few
Reds, whose houses we painted yellow. And the interest
ing thing is that we kept up this drama of the emotions
for about eighteen months. All the while our feelings
grew tenser and all the while the feeling of cosmic heebie-
jeebies gained by leaps and bounds. When the war closed
we were just worked up to the proper pitch. We were,
if I may change the figure to one that illustrates our state
of mind and body better than any other, tumescent. We
had indulged in wild and lascivious dreams. We had
imagined ourselves in the act of intercourse with the
Whore of the world. Then suddenly the war was over and
the Whore vanished for a time and we were in a con
dition of coitus interruptus.
What was the result? We made a religion of our hate.
We made a God of Uncle Sam and doctrines of our
national beliefs, and we found devils for our new religion

among the Jews, the Catholics, and the Negroes. If there
had been no Jews, Catholics, or Negroes, we would have
found others to have served our purposes just as well.
I may anticipate the actual record enough here to point
out that the Catholics and Jews and Negroes were as
signed evil significance quite cosmic in character. The
Jew we hated was not so much Ikey who came for the
old clothes as his rich and essentially unreal brother who
controlled the movies of America and sought to induce
our maidens into a net of prostitution; he was a giant
conspirator who would denude the land of morals. The
Catholics were ordinary folks as a whole and we had no
actual hatred of them; it was the Pope (the dago on the
Tiber) that we hated, and his damned scheme to sup
plant the stars and stripes with the crucifix and place
his boney hand upon the national heart. Nor was it the
black woman who cooked our meals that made us in the
South hate the Negro. We hated something more than
the Negro: we hated the idea of him, the possibility that
he might become a national menace and a threat to our
racial solidarity.
When the War closed I was in a small provincial
Texas village studying history and politics. When we got
the news everyone of us good Methodists turned to sav
ages, and with the blanket approval of the authorities.
Even the girls were let out of their dormitories and all
of us went down to the square where we danced, not
together of course, around a burning effigy of the Kaiser.
That, I believe, is what the War meant to the great
portion of our citizenry. It meant first intensification
and then release of emotion—nothing more. Everything
was done in effigy, and the result was a new religion.
With us in this state the recrudescence of the Klan was
inevitable. It came—and its real growth began of course
in 1919
—not as the result of the high sales ability of
Edward Young Clarke, but as a result of the very deep
and vast need in our own fevered souls for some kind of
continuation of the ritual of the imaginary to which we
had been accustomed by more than eighteen months of
systematic training in imaginary hatred and ferocity and

bravery. We had assumed, to the immense satisfaction of
ourselves, the role of saviour of humanity. It was a role
which we could not easily relinquish, particularly since
we had developed so acute a sense of danger for our
beloved land and its ideals.
The War itself was fought idealistically. We waged
it in our minds and around fortresses which were the
protection of everything dear to us. We were not only
emotionally but mentally prepared for Kristianity. We
fought not the Germans but the Hun ; we entered not
for selfish aggrandizement but for the protection of hu
man life and property; we had no ulterior ends to seek
but longed for the security of our own and other peo
ples ; we armed to disarm others ; we never went to battle
with the enemy but launched a crusade for the inter
national righteousness of man. Even the paper by which
the government secured our financial co-operation was
given a ritualistic and idealistic name. We were not pay
ing taxes to a king; we were buying Liberty Bonds for
the emancipation of humanity. Being essentially a naive
people, we could fight only for high and holy mo
tives; whatever may be said of those who put the war
across, this much is true: They knew the American
mind.
With all this catechism and consecration we disciplined
ourselves to think of ourselves as a people peculiarly or
dained of God to lead humanity to the Promised Land.
We were ready for the final Confirmation which the
Klan performed for us. We had been spared the deple
tion which befell England, the devastation that was
France's, and the revolution that was Russia's. What we
had was not what Italy had, nor what Russia had, but
a sort of glorified Sunday School picnic, a religion which
went off in the air and carried on satisfactorily the in
ternational drama of idealism to which we were accus
tomed. And by the strange alchemy which this national
religion wrought, the ideals which made us the friend of
oppressed peoples in other lands during the war made
us the enemy of the oppressed within our own land after
the War was over.

256 THE CONFUSION OF. JONGUES
n
The first and original Klan in the South followed upon
the heels of a war. It sprang from that peculiar state of
mind in which a people finds itself after the enemy has
been destroyed or else has called off his hounds. The sense
of crisis invoked by a war never ends with what is
roughly called peace. It persists long afterward and de
mands a vehicle of one sort or another to express the
aroused fears of the populace. These fears were gigantic
and real to the Southern people, and they found in the
Klan an instrument admirably suited to their purposes.
The old Southern Klan was at first simply a fraternal
order.
In May 1866 a group of young fellows with time hang
ing heavy on their hands now that the war was over
decided to organize a club. These young men had gath
ered in the back of a law office in the small but relatively
cultured town of Pulaski, Tennessee, not far from the
Alabama line. A club which would have some mystic
significance appealed heartily to the assembled swains
and of course the next step was to select a name. Among
the names suggested was "Kukloi," the plural of "Kuk-
los," the Greek word for circle. "Ku Klux" a barbariza-
tion of the word Kuklos was suggested and at once
adopted.1 The word Klan was of course added to carry
out the alliteration, and soon the name Ku Klux Klan got
into currency. It was for a time nothing but a circle of
young Southerners who met for purposes about as im
portant as those which generally convoke Elks from their
homes. But, suited as it was to the psychology of the
period and meeting the demands of secrecy, it soon grew
into an agency of social regulation, in which its regalia
and mysterious practices became the religious machinery
for the control of politics and morals.
It may be that the Reverend William Joseph Simmons
intended that the revived Klan should take the harmless
form of a body of hooded Elks—a fraternal order pure

and simple. I have seen the point argued at length but
it does not coincide with the Emperor's own testimony or
with the ceremonious inauguration which the new Klan
enjoyed. Mr. Ward Greene, a newspaper man of At
lanta, is authority for the claim that William Joseph
started out to found a drinking club for Georgia poli
ticians. How much truth there is to this contention, I
cannot say. Some credence is lent to it by the fact that
for several years before the establishment of the new
order the Emperor tramped about from village to village
in the South organizing lodges for the Woodmen of the
World and pepping up those already organized.
But William Joseph Simmons had also been a
preacher. In common with most of our political re
formers he was drawn from the pulpit and he carried
over into his new activities the vocabulary and methods
of thought that had marked his profession. He claims that
he nurtured in his breast for fifteen years the idea of the
Ku Klux Klan, that he worked diligently for those years
to get into a position wherefrom it might be organized.
His crowning ambition from boyhood, he says, had been
to organize the real American citizens into a great army
of righteousness. As early as 1901 he was startled by a
great vision of America's need. This vision took place
actually and in the skies. He was seated on a bench out
side the door of his cottage. At that time he was an im
pecunious preacher in Alabama, first of one church, then
of another. Without premonition of any sort he suddenly
beheld this ominous and at the same time beatific vision in
the heavens. A deep blue sky was overhung with light
clouds, and as he beheld them they suddenly took on
meaningful shape and began to move rapidly across the
sky. They changed shape with the volatility of all clouds
—now they were like a weasel, perhaps, and now like
a walrus —but as he gazed intently upon them there came
to the seer the unmistakable picture of long rows of horses
galloping upon some purposive chase. Too, there were
white-robed figures on the steeds. All in all the vision
vouchsafed him was that of a vast and richly clad army
of mounted men—the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan re

born and reanimated to save America from the alien
crisis which even in those days threatened her hegemony.
Falling to his knees, William Joseph Simmons offered
a prayer of wonder and gratitude to God for the vision
he had seen. That vision he never forgot. He had been
commissioned then and there —as certainly and as au
thentically as Joseph Smith had been—to found a
national order which should save humanity from its sin
of un-Americanism and preserve all that was near and
dear to the heart of our citizens.
"In the year 1915," he says, "I was sufficiently pre
pared, in head and heart, to make a start on my life's
mission—to me a most sacred and holy mission." 2
On
Thanksgiving night of that year he took sixteen intrepid
spirits with him to the crest of Stone Mountain, near
Atlanta, and there "on the top of a mountain that night
at the midnight hour while men braved the surging blasts
of wild wintry mountain winds and endured a tempera
ture far below freezing, bathed in the sacred glow of the
fiery cross, the Invisible Empire was called from its
slumber of half a century." A reporter for the New York
World was unkind enough to consult the records of the
Weather Bureau and found that the lowest temperature
recorded that night was forty-five degrees. But let that
pass. Here in a mystical ceremony, from the mind of a
mystic, the new Klan came into existence.
The account given by the egregious Hiram W. Evans
is even more fascinating to the observer of religious psy
chology:
At midnight, Thanksgiving, 191 5, sixteen men, who had braved the
chilling wind and cutting sleet, stood about an altar on the summit of
Stone Mountain, DeKalb County, Georgia. The altar, comprising six
teen boulders dropped into their places from the shoulders of the weary
pilgrims, had spread upon it the American Flag, and on the Flag lay
the Holy Bible —open at the twelfth chapter of Romans. At the con
clusion of the ceremony, which declared that the Bible and the Flag
should be for ever paramount in their hearts and lives, and in the

the world—from which they had been temporarily, but completely,
separated.8
We have already seen that the Klan was born in a
vision, that it came from a man trained in theological
formulae, and that it arose in his mind at a time when
nothing but the most imaginary danger threatened
America. There were, to be sure, wars and rumours of
wars. He was a typical provincial American who had
heard of Europe, and had read a great deal about its evils.
He was enveloped down in Alabama by a vague haze
of insecurity, and God set before him elaborate en-
ginary to dispel that haze. His first act afterwards was an
act of religious devotion. When he founded the Klan
he was ready to launch a "most sacred and holy mission."
And he launched
it,
not in the back of
a
saloon, but on
the mountain top —up where Moses got the Ten Com
mandments and Jesus took his favourite disciple for the
transfiguration. Going there was essentially
a
religious
act. The symbol which he selected —the fiery Cross—was
a religious symbol, and even the exaggeration of the tem
perature has about
it
some of the overstatement and
dramatization that
is
to be found in all sacred writings.
The ritual he had contrived in the interim, as we shall
have plenty of occasion to see, was
a
purposely contrived
religious ceremony.
The men who went up into the mountain were called
apart from the rest of mankind for
a
service of mystical
importance. They knelt before an altar. They saw there
one sacred symbol, the open Bible, which in turn gave
sacredness to the other by the side of
it,
the flag. They
went as "pilgrims" with "weary shoulders"; they
wrought their altar through sacrifice. They performed
an act of consecration and then descended the mountain
purified and animated for service among their fellow
SH. W. Evans, Imperial Wizard, The Klan
of
Tomorrow and the Klan
Spiritual, p. 17. At the end of the pamphlet containing
it
are these words:
"During the delivery of this address the great audience of men sat in silence,
as though entranced. At its conclusion the Klonvocation arose quietly and stood
in reverential spirit Someone started "Onward, Christian Soldiers" and the
song was joined in by the deeply impressed men." This at the Klonvocation
of 1924 at St. Louis.

mortals. What they did and thought that night set the
pace and formula for the whole behaviour of after-war
America.
In the light of these facts it will pay us to look into
the mental apparatus and habits of the man who made the
Klan. Simmons occupies the same relation to the Klan
that Mrs. Eddy did to Christian Science and Pastor Rus
sell to the preposterous sect he created. Edward Young
Clarke may have sold the Klan and Hiram W. Evans
may have stolen
it,
but William Joseph Simmons started
it. Clarke had something to sell —and that something was
an immensely satisfactory system of religion which pro
vided Americans who were hoeing corn and beating car
pets for Mother with
a
means of continuing the righteous
excitement that they had found so pleasurable
a
year or
two before.
The highly emotional thinking that the Emperor
is
capable of doing
is
best seen in
a
book which he wrote in
1926. In this book, America's Menace or the Enemy
Within, he offers
a
forthright statement of what he in
tended the original Klan to be. It
is
a
vindication of the
Klan before Evans got his dental hands upon its throat,
and
it
offers the reader
a
thoroughly varnished statement
of the Klan principles and
a
perfect example of the type
of mind that conceived the monstrosity known as the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
Simmons's style must not be overlooked. He
is
a
spell
binder of the first water and he can hardly write
a
sen
tence that does not read like
a
solemn statement from
a
ritual. Every paragraph resounds with symbolic phrases
calculated to invoke the blessings of the patriotic Holy
Ghost. There
is
thunder in every sentence, and one does
not marvel, after reading this book, that the principles
of the Ku Klux Klan fell sweetly upon the ears of stam
mering Americans left with
a
lot of hate and energy on
their hands just after
a
rather hilarious and all too brief
period of war.

KU KLUXISM 261
There follows a portrait of Simmons and underneath
it are these words:
He Who Traversed the Realm of the Unknown, Wrested the Solemn
Secret From the Grasp of Night and Became the Sovereign Imperial
Master of the Great Lost Mystery.4
Before we have gone five pages we learn that all things
sacred are rapidly slipping from our possession and that
"we are wantonly wasting our substance, our holy heri
tage, in riotous, reckless, ruinous living." There continues
the same type of expression with which the Emperor
lashed the patriots to service in the good old days of
19 19-1920
—the same reference to crouching monsters
ready to devour us. As Professor John Moffatt Mecklin
points out in his book, The Ku Klux Klan: A Study of
the American Mind, Simmons has a "singular ability to
insinuate himself into the sympathies of the average man
of the middle class, and to play upon his likes and dis
likes."
This accounts in no small measure for the success of
the Klan Kreed as he formulated it. He was able to say
in hifalutin language what the average carpenter
imagined; he gave reality to unrealities and divine sig
nificance to vain imaginings. He is the American mind
working at its best and with a sufficient vocabulary and
fluency to convince itself of the truth of what it claims
to believe.
It gives us a sort of pleasant shiver to learn that our
country is "sorely beset and imminently imperiled"; and
I confess myself not immune to the picture he draws
when he says :
Dangers dire and deadly are covertly crouched on all sides desirous of
devouring it [our country]. Insidious evils, stealthily creeping in, are
subtly establishing themselves in strategic positions in preparation for
the day of America's doom.5
There is a picture that no village hoodlum could re
sist if he had just been hating the Germans. It carries

extraordinary power because it doesn't mean a thing. It
gives us the pleasant sense of danger without anything
really ugly to look at or run from. Our danger, the ex-
Emperor goes on to say, is "not from the bristling bay
onets of hostile battalions nor bulging barrels of bel
ligerent battleships of any other nation; but it is the
more certain and effective danger of internal disintegra
tion." In other words, to the sophisticate, there is no
danger at all, but to the average man who can get excited
over the alliterative rhetoric of the Emperor, there is a
danger far more real than any physical threat. The aver
age man feared something at the end of the war. He didn't
know just what it was, and that made him all the more
frightened. Simmons, with his caparisoned steeds and the
twelfth chapter of Romans, lent religious meaning to that
fear, and consequently righteous justification. He trans
formed fear into the courage of a holy war. To him the
arch fiend is an abstract idea which he terms the "per
sistent, penetrating poison of pernicious 'alien' propa
ganda." He calls upon people to fear "the wild trained
anarchists from the precincts of Petrograd or the Prov
inces of Poland." Politics he makes "the sacred science
of good government," and "pacificist propaganda" he
dismisses as "perilously poisonous." "America today has
not a friend without, and millions of enemies, positive
and potential, within." The whole outlook for the land
is rather gloomy; "With religion ruined; politics per
manently polluted: amusement perverted: music mu
tilated; literature poisoned; and character corrupted; in
unrighteous revelry America will crumble into chaos."
The only hope lies in the gathering of the Klan, "the
prompt assembling of the uncontaminated and true
American citizenry." 6
That is Simmons's philosophy in his own nutshell. And
though these words and the book from which they are
taken were written in 1926, they express in cogent form
the ideas which lay in the mind of the man who founded
the Klan. In the circular, The Ku Klux Klan Forever,

which the Emperor wrote before he was unhorsed by the
cunning Texan, Simmons spoke of the Klan as follows :
To destroy it is an impossibility, for it belongs in essence to the realms
spiritual. . . . Attuned with Deity, functioning only for all humanity's
good, misjudged by ignorance, misunderstood by many, slandered by
prejudice, sweeping on under the divine leadership of Deity, it never
falters and will never fail.
His own mind, as it expresses itself in the Klan and in
reference to
it,
is
that of
a
colossal religious maniac, the
mind of
a
man who even goes so far as to take on some of
the attributes of Deity and speak of himself in the lan
guage which
is
generally associated with only the sacred
writings of the Christian faith. He tells in this book
America's Menace of his struggles to launch the Klan
properly when he started in 191
5.
There were attempts
to steal
it,
but they failed. Then came the attack of the
newspapers, the pack led by the New York World, "but
the virtue of the Klan came through perilous persecution,
untarnished and intact." The government itself took up
the perilous persecution, but to no avail, for all humanity
by that time had sought and found "their heart's desire,
peace of mind, security of hope, and opportunity of con
certed service beneath the sacred glow of the Fiery
Cross."
These attempts on the part of the evil one having failed,
Simmons says the "enemy thought he could get control
of the Klan by buying ME." And in strangely familiar
language he continues: "He offered me the Kingdoms
of all the States of the United States and the glory of
them,
if
I
would bow down and worship them."
7
This
failed too and then the conspiracy to replace him with
Hiram W. Evans succeeded and the divine agency which
Simmons had given to humanity was transformed at once
into
a
thing of evil designs and terror.
Note the language and manner in which the former
Emperor speaks of the Klan and the sacred substance
it
contains. To him

was more than an organization, more
than the most important organization in the world. It

was an Ark of a Covenant with God, containing specially
distilled and etherealized mysteries which he alone could
convey to humanity. When he saw that he must retire
from leadership and that the child he had conceived and
nurtured would be taken from him, he said :
I was in Gethsemane, and the gloom of its dense darkness entombed
me; the cup which I drank surpassed bitterest gall, and my sweat was
the sweat of blood ; the hour of my crucifixion was at hand.8
The analogy between his death and that of Another he
pushes even further, for he points out that he was cruci
fied on the cross of cupidity and that he was betrayed by
friends.
The result is that the hungry multitudes have been
given a stone and they long to have their "father in Klan-
kraft feed their starving souls with the true bread of
life." He had only begun to establish the real mysteries
of the order when it was taken away from him ; he could
not give all because the people were not prepared. He
had never communicated real Klankraft to his follow
ers, and no one but him today knows the "sublime lofti
ness" of its "mystic philosophies." And then follows this
amazing passage:
I am the door of Klankraft; no man can enter therein but by ME.
If any other door is offered, the same is a cheat and a swindle and he
who offers it is a thief and a robber. I am the way, the truth and the
life in the kingdom of Klankraft, and no man can come into the REAL
Klan but by ME: for I alone have the TRUE word; and my very
soul yearns to gather the real Americans together, as a hen gathers her
brood and direct them onward and upward to the blissful consumma
tion of their highest and fondest hopes.8
And with ringing tones he enjoins those who have gone
off after Evans :
Come unto ME all you who yearn and labour after Klankraft and
I will give you rest. Take my program upon you and learn of me, for
I am unselfish and true at heart. ... I am the one custodian and sole
Master of the sublime Mystery.

KU KLUXISM 265
The program to which he alludes in this last passage
was conceived as much in religious fervour as the ideas
which he expresses about his personal messiaship. It
looked to the establishment of five great universities
throughout the length and breadth of America, in which
young men and women could properly be taught the
truth about American history. Simmons himself was for
a time professor of history at Lanier University, At
lanta. To supplement the school system was to be a mam
moth scheme for the production of sound textbooks on
history, written by reverent souls who would tell the
Truth. It was, as he says, the greatest schoolbook pro
gram ever comtemplated. It was to include books for use
all the way from the kindergarten to graduate studies —■
all to be produced by patriotic Americans and all to sell
at a saving of from 25 to 50 per cent. This corps of work
ers was to prepare a true history of America, "begin
ning with the true discovery of America by Lief Ericson,
in the year 1,000, and continuing to the present time and
throughout the future." Beyond these agencies there was
to be a gigantic banking and trust institution for the aid
of starving farmers, evidently intended either to sup
plant or supplement the Federal Reserve, and a fatherly
system of providing young Klan husbands with homes for
their new wives. There was also to be worked out a
method of supporting all Klan orphans and a chain of
hospitals was to be established, in which could be pro
cured the services of the best physicians, gratis.
These humanitarian enterprises were to be crowned by
still another and that had to do with a stupendous reli
gious crusade. Simmons looked to the solidarity and
unity of American Protestantism in the pursuit of evan
gelical Christianity and in "the evangelization of men."
And it would have meant the establishment in every
city of a great Klan Kathedral, "whose doors would be
open to all who wanted to enter to worship and receive
spiritual strength." Each of the services in these Kathe-
drals was to be distinctly evangelical, for, in the belief of
Simmons, "evangelism, shorn of denominational and sec
tarian confusion, is the hope for America's soul."

266 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
III
I have sketched in brief the program which Emperor
Simmons had in view for the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, and have given some indication of his manner of
thinking about it and presenting it. If ever there was a
self-anointed messiah, it was Emperor Simmons, and
if ever there was a malignant religious kult, that kult
Was the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
Now just what was the net effect of these mystic
philosophies once they got going among the tenant farm
ers and decadent whites of the provinces? The answer has
been given in the excess of cruelty and sadism which the
Klan loosed on this continent. It offered the average
klodhopper a chance to escape his sense of impotence by
waging a colossal war against foreign and cosmic princi
palities for the preservation of what he supposed to be
dear to him. The torturous and inquisitorial methods of
the Klan were the direct result of its mystic philosophies,
particularly since these conveyed the feelings which most
after-war Americans had in their stomachs. As Frank
Bohn in the American Journal of Sociology for January
1925 phrases it:
To organize healthy, sturdy, adventure-loving young men, half of
whom have just been mustered out of the army and navy; to fire their
hearts with the thought that their beloved country is in imminent
danger; and then to expect them to be satiated by repeating the Klan
ritual twice a month, surely that was expecting to pluck figs from
thistles.
What happened was that the Klan, having no actual
enemies, created enough foes in the air to keep their
courage up and then turned to any obstreperous man or
element who displeased them. The Klan first universal
ized, then localized danger. Bohn also tells of encounter
ing an impecunious farmer in the middle of Ohio who
felt that the country was in a state of unprecedented
danger, that the Jews were carrying off young girls to
become white slaves, that they were controlling the mov
ies, and that the Pope was daily making inroads on Wash
ington. He was obsessed with the fear that the Klan might

have come too late and that the country might already be
irretrievably lost. It was a mythical Jew and a symbolical
Catholic that this man feared and hated. The Jews as a
race became devils, and everything from a profiteer to an
anarchist was regarded as a Jew. Then, after the concept
had been made sufficiently general to inspire alarm
throughout the countryside, the Klan easily localized it
and came to hate the Jews and Catholics in each com
munity. That is why I say that the Klan was not essen
tially a prejudice-mongering organization bent mali
ciously upon the destruction of Jews, Negroes and Cath
olics. It was first and foremost a religion, and like all
religions it had its devils. These devils were abstract mon
sters —Negro lust and insubordination, Jewish mone
tary power, and Catholic domination of the government.
It was in these broad and effusive generalities that the
Klan thought first of its enemies. Then, as I say, it was
only a short step from the Pope to the Katholic who set
up a delicatessen across the street from one already owned
by a Methodist.
It is fairly obvious that the Klan was nearer to being a
tribal religion than anything else. It had that narrowness
and exclusiveness about it that marks primitive races.
For we emerged from the war with the solemn convic
tion that we were God's Chosen People. That is no figure
of speech. It was an actual belief. Hiram W. Evans, in
the interview given the Chicago Daily News in 1924,
said that civilization must be maintained by America
and that "national pre-eminence is enjoined upon us by
God." We simply had no choice in the matter. If Jehovah
had singled us out for service, we were the last people
on earth to fail him. It was this belief which prompted
much of our humanitarian work, even in liberal circles.
Everywhere we heard that America must lead the way.
To the pacifist that meant lead the way to world peace;
to the Kluxer it meant keep ourselves pure and unspotted
from the world. But both the Kluxer and the pacifist
were agreed upon the singularity of America's calling.
In The Landmark, for April 1924, appeared this ex
planation:

268 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
If the Klan aspires to purify America and make her impregnable, it
is not for any selfish reason ; selfishness corrodes and destroys the soul ;
it is in order that America, pure and impregnable, may extend a giant's
helping hand toward the people less fortunate.
I should not wish to appear derisive in the use of such"
quotations. The Klan was founded upon solemn convic
tions and its postulates were shared by a great many peo
ple of high spiritual intentions. But the fact is that we
took ourselves to be led of God, and taking that for
granted, anything we did seemed to us to be quite in keep
ing with the divine order of things.
It follows as the day follows the night that our institu
tions took on a sacrosanct importance and we were ready
not only to die for them but to talk about them in the
most astounding terms. We were told by one writer that
the principles underlying American Government "are
spiritual in origin and were given to the people of this
country, not by human intellect but by divine authority."
These principles, he feels, are divinely inspired, and he
continues: "The Constitution of the United States is the
greatest masterpiece of judicial literature ever inspired
by God and penned by mortal man, outside of the Holy
Bible." He charges us to stop the "tide of immigration
into our ports and thus increase our spiritual strength,
our moral energies and the spirit of brotherly love." The
other unfortunate peoples of the earth need the benefit
of our "unadulterated national ideals . . . the blessings
that flow from a pure and upright national life." 10
The lengths of exaggeration to which our national
mind will go are well evidenced by the following pass
age from the same author. It has no regard for the facts,
and indeed it need not have, for it is the presentation of
a religious and imaginary situation. He speaks of Euro
pean countries in comparison with our own and delivers
himself of these remarkable sentiments:
Their land has been stained with bloody wars, ours has been one of
peace. Their civilization has been marked with strife and bloodshed; ours
has been adorned with peace and tranquillity. Their defense is built

upon fear and hate; ours has been resting upon love and enlightened
conscience. They have fostered class hatred and slavery, while America
has maintained equality and liberty. They have been led by materialistic
and selfish motives, while we have been led by Spiritual ideals.11
And in eloquent conclusion he asks, "Shall we allow the
dark cloud that has hung for centuries above European
tivilization to overshadow America, and with bitter
pangs of desolation, pollute the purity of our Christian
civilization?"
In the interview given in Chicago during 1924, to
which I have already alluded, Evans referred to the Con
stitution as the Klan's political Bible. He went on to say
in more exact terms, however, that "Klansmen stand on
the Holy Bible. Upon the Holy Bible rest the American
constitution and the American nation. Klansmen are
wholeheartedly Christian, implacably opposed to athe
istic intellectualism and to all amatory and erotic ten
dencies of modern degeneracy." It may be urged that
Evans here makes use as do all the other fanatics, of what
has already found favour with the people for bolstering
up his cause. This same may be urged against the use of
the Bible which Christian Science and other cults have
so abundantly made. But the larger fact seems to be that
Evans's mind and the mind of the Klan turn naturally to
the Bible as a sacred symbol because they themselves
are engaged in a sacred undertaking. Their use of the
Bible is not ulterior. It is inevitable.
We must not fail to note that the ritual of the Klan
is nothing short of an elaborate liturgy, conceived in the
mind of a bigoted religionist and subscribed to by men
whose thoughts were constantly upon the lofty things of
life. And in swiftly passing I must note that the Klan
is,
in conception, organization, practice and method, almost
the doppelganger of the Roman Catholic Church. It has
the same high regard for pomp and circumstance and
prelates and dignitaries and makes the same use of in
censed ideas and relic-symbols. It was Americanized
Catholicism.

270 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
But now about the ritual. The Klan's term Kludd, the
word for chaplain, is borrowed from the high priests of
the ancient Druids. Its word Kloran, meaning the sacred
book containing the ceremonies of the order, is formed
by putting an "1" after the "K" in Koran. Thus we have
the Kloran of the White American Protestants. Its Open
ing Klode is sung to the tune of "Greenland's Icy Moun
tains." There are two long-winded prayers in the order
of the Service, one devoted to the Emperor and the other
to the success of the Invisible Empire. And the service is
closed with "Blest Be the Tie that Binds."
Moreover, the candidate or neophyte is not initiated,
but naturalized. There is presumably a changed status
induced in him, a sort of spiritual transfiguration. He is
ushered into the mystic kingdom by means of a cere
mony simulating very closely that of Christian baptism,
at least as it is practised among the Methodists and Pres
byterians. Captain Fry tells us that the alien is led to
the sacred altar, "where rests the American flag, upon
which is a Holy Bible, open at the twelfth chapter of Ro
mans, which Simmons says is his 'spiritual charter,' and
across the pages of the Word of God is a naked dagger."
As the ceremony proceeds and the alien is instructed in
the meaning of Americanism, the Exalted Cyclops takes
a glass of water and dedicates the alien, setting him thus
apart from the common run of his fellows and offering
him the opportunity of lofty service in the Invisible Em
pire. Then, says Fry, a parody on "Just As I Am" is sung
"by those of the elect who can carry a tune." Following
this the Exalted Cyclops steps forward and pours water
on his shoulder, his head, and throws a few drops into
the air, making the dedication "in mind, in body, in
spirit, and in life." l2
Even a casual examination of the vocabulary of the
order will lead us into a volume of cyclopedic dimen
sions. It suffices to say that the words used are all sym
bols, though their suggestions are not always the happiest
—witness the word "Kloran." But they are supposed to
mean something. The Imperial Wizard is defined in the
« Henry P. Fry, The Modern Ku Klux Klan, Chapter VII, p. 89-94.

back pages of the Kloran as "The Emperor of the In
visible Empire; a wise man; a wonder worker, having
power to charm and control." The days of the Klan
calender express its sombre psychology. The days of the
week are Dark, Deadly, Dismal, Doleful, Desolate,
Dreadful, Desperate—the weeks of the month being
Woeful, Weeping, Wailing, Wonderful, Weird. And the
months of the year need only to be repeated in a row to
stir a mild man to murder: Bloody, Gloomy, Hideous,
Fearful, Furious, Alarming, Terrible, Horrible, Mourn
ful, Sorrowful, Frightful, Appalling.
I doubt that many of our learned Bible scholars are
aware of the references to the Klan in the actual words
of the Holy Writ. If not, it is simply because the enemies
of the Klan have been stricken blind and fail to see what
is so plainly there. Bishop Alma White of the Pillar of
Fire Church in New Jersey has been good enough to trace
out these references for us and has embodied the result
of her seasoned findings in a book called The Ku Klux
Klan in Prophecy. It was published as late as 1925 and
carries the diocesan imprimatur of Arthur H. Bell, who
was at that time Imperial Representative Realm of New
Jersey. In granting his approval to the work and com
mending it to the American public, Father Bell has this
to say :
The book brings out vividly the titantic struggle now taking place,
not only in the United States, but over the entire world, and while at
the present time the battle raging has not reached a point where swords,
bullets and poisoned gas are the weapons used, the time will soon arrive
when the Roman Catholic craving for world power will, if not checked,
cause a revival of a religious war that will be far more disastrous than
the late World War. The ever-increasing insistence of the Roman Cath
olic hierarchy as to their rights to control nations, is leading to the mob
ilization of a white-robed Christian army of Protestant men and women
who are banded together with an equal determination that our nation
at least shall be allowed to function without the dominating hand of
any creed or sect. ia
With that information we are ready to study the Bible
in the light of the Klan. This study, unfortunately, is a

little vague, and the good Bishop must resort for the most
part to pictures to get her ideas graphically across. We
are treated to a picture of Jesus, or Khrist, as the Bishop
would probably have us say, feeding the five thousand.
Every mother's son of them has on a robe and hood. The
apostles and helpers stand eagerly by to receive the
bread and fishes, and they too are hooded. The caption
reads: "In like manner the truth is being carried to the
people by the Ku Klux Klan."
The Good Samaritan appears in a robe, of course. The
ass upon which he set the unfortunate man who fell among
thieves is shown to be a steed of good parts, properly
caparisoned in the regalia of the Klan. The Priest and the
Levite, obviously symbols of the Roman Catholic Church,
are shown taking to their heels across the rugged country
as the Klansman lifts the wounded man into the saddle.
Under this picture are printed the words, "The Good
Samaritan (K.K.K.)."
And then there is that excellent picture in which the
three Hebrew Children are dressed in the robes of the
Klan. Even the Jews of Bible days had good Klan traits
in them. They refused to bow to the Golden Image, who
in the drawing is the Pope, while Tammany and all the
others are on their knees. We have here an anomaly. The
three Hebrew Children "represent the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan at this period of our national history." It
is very much the same anomaly that occurred when the
first pictures of the Klan in full regalia were printed
throughout America. These pictures, carried by the New
York Times and other first-rate papers, were not en
dorsed by Simmons or the authorities. Ward Greene tells
us that an enterprising photographer of Atlanta got the
drift of the uniform and hired a group at twenty-five
cents a man to wear the hood and cowl. It was of this
group that the first pictures were made, and the men be
neath the robes were Negroes recruited from the bottoms
of Georgia.
Bishop White tells us that one must have "divine il

so necessary at this critical hour." She then proceeds to
take all the stories of the Bible and make the heroes Klans-
men and the villains either Jews or Catholics. For exam
ple, we find in Jonah a universal allegory of that unfor
tunate race called the Jews. They are "indigestible, in
flexible, and unbreakable, as we have proved in the case
of Jonah in the stomach of the great fish." And in the il
lustration which accompanies this shrewd piece of exe-
fesis,
Bishop White shows the swarthy sailors of that
ay, clad in the hood of the Klan, heaving the ill-starred
Jonah to the great Fish, which turns out to be America.
We learn further in a relation to modern affairs that
the Jews and Catholics are at present in cahoots against
the Protestants. "In New York," we find, "it is almost
impossible for anyone to do business who has not the mark
of the beast on his forehead. There are multiplied hun
dreds of thousands of White Gentile American women
under Jewish bosses in the movies, dance-halls, sweat
shops, department stores and innumerable other places,
including the white-slave dens." " And in the hour of
peril the Ku Klux Klan is the "instrument in God's hand
to preserve our American ideals and institutions."
And so it goes. We learn of Gideon's army of 100 per
centers, as the Bishop calls them, and we are told that they
had good reason to work under the cover of night. If,
therefore, anyone wants to know why the Klansman wears
a mask, "you have only to consult the words of Holy
Writ." She goes so far as to call Gideon's men brave
Klansmen and she shows her knowledge of religious hab
its of thought in general by the assertion that there are
no words in Holy Writ to support the dogmas of the
Roman Catholic Church. She may know prophecy but
she knows pathetically little about what we call human
nature.
Even Old Elijah's muscles are swathed in the robes of
the order. He is shown, his hood flying and his cowl tilted
in the breeze, running before the chariot of state in which
the stately Uncle Sam is riding as a sort of Ahab in mod
ern dress. In still another place Bishop White gives us

the picture of the American Eagle hovering over the cap
ital at Washington ; in one of its claws is the fiery cross, in
the other the Holy Bible. There is a hood and cowl over
its beak and a robe over its body. He hovers angrily and
threateningly, like an angry mother bird, over a picture
of the capital building and is thrusting his spear (Amer
icanism) into a sinister hand, labelled Rome, which is
ready to crush the stately edifice to bits.
I have cited enough to show that Bishop White and
the Realm of New Jersey are in earnest. This is no mere
sectarian animosity to which she gives expression. The
Pope is the Anti-Christ and the Roman Catholic Church
is to her powerfully sincere mind the whole host of wick
edness. The Klan is no mere agency with a lofty purpose,
but an instrument in the hands of God. The patriots
which comprise it are "not only custodians of liberty, but
of the whole social and moral structure, involving both
politics and religion. The Almighty in his wisdom has
chosen both men and women of dependable character and
is enlisting them under the Stars and Stripes and the
Fiery Cross to bring about a transformation for the bet
terment of Society." As for those who oppose the Klan,
they can be set down as follows: "The Roman Catholic
Church, together with its military arm the Knights of
Columbus, the apostate Jews, some Negroes, former
brewers and distillers, bootleggers, rum-runners, white
slavers, gamblers, harlots, wife-beaters, thieves, murder
ers, crooked politicians, lawbreakers generally, and a few
honest but misinformed American Protestants." 15
In
short, all the emissaries of the Devil, either wilfully or by
deception. And as for those who are members, they "are
the very best citizens of the United States." Was there
ever a more clear-cut demarkation drawn between saints
and sinners, sheep and goats?
Let us hear then the conclusion of the whole matter as
far as Bishop White is concerned. "If God sees fit to work

visible Empire,' it is useless for any man to make a pro
test." 18
And as for details, why, "The Klan stands for the
supremacy of the white race, which is perfectly legiti
mate and in accordance with the words of Holy Writ, and
anything that is decreed by the all-wise God should
not work a hardship on the coloured race." 17
From an
equally frantic book, called Christ and Other Klansmen,
we have this tit-bit: "The man who fights the Klan is
helping sin to reign." For, as the author, Reverend E. F.
Stanton, tells us, God is the author of Klanism and "God
is Klannish and works secretly."
The material to show the fear psychology and religious
symbolism could be multiplied a thousandfold if that
were not a work of supererogation. We could note the lit
tle booklet called the K.K.K. Katechism, dedicated to
Hiram W. Evans and carrying at the back of the book the
note that the information it contained was supplied by the
Wizard Himself, leaving us to guess who dedicated the
book. We could note that it contains a number of Chris
tian hymns, among them "The Old Rugged Cross," "Sun
shine in My Soul" and "I Love to Tell the Story." We
could note also the adroitness with which the questions
and answers are phrased, leading the user to the conclu
sion in one place that Columbus, being a Catholic and
being financed by a Catholic regime, discovered only a
few paltry islands, while Cabot, the doughty sailor of a
Protestant king, was the first to discover the new Canaan.
We would be interested to learn that all the Popes of
history have, with a few exceptions, been guilty of every
known crime.
Captain Fry tells of certain literature of ammunition
variety which he received in the days before he apos
tatized. It was headed "Do You Know?" and among
others it contained the following questions, all of them
answered by their asking:
That a secret treaty made by the Pope started the war?
That he controls the daily and magazine press?

The atrocities of the Klan do not concern us here, save
in so far as they demonstrate the Klan philosophy in ac
tion. The mind can not stay for ever in the realm of fancy.
It must come sooner or later to the realities which make
up the life of the average —I had almost said unimagina
tive—American. When the Klan got going in the com
monwealth, it loosed the dogs of war upon any local man
or group who happened to be under the protection of the
archfiends seeking to destroy America. And if these were
not to be found in the form of Catholics or Jews or Ne
groes, then wayside neckers would suffice. The war had
made cruelty and sadism righteous; it made hate a Chris
tian virtue. It brought the welcome message to the sons of
frontiersmen, accustomed now in part but not entirely
to the sedentary life of the small town, that torture and
even death were to be permitted if only they were in
flicted on behalf of the cause of God. Men and women
who parked their cars by the side of the road were com
mitting sin; therefore, they merited the wrath of God
and what could be more logical than for the instrument
which the all-wise God had chosen to administer his
holy wrath? Once given the psychology of the Klan and
its ritualistic expression, the atrocities are nothing but
good works emanating from faith.
The revolt of youth and the general insurrection
against morality which followed the war threatened the
prestige of old ideas which had themselves taken on a
certain religious significance. Both religious fear and
religious justification were operative in the Klan's out
rages. Tell a group of Christian barbers that they are
sons of God especially chosen for the task of preserving
American morals and we need not marvel if they whip
the village whore.

KU KLUXISM 277
In The Searchlight, official organ of the Klan in those
good old days of Christian heathenism, there is printed
the following extract from a sermon by a Texas preacher.
It is recorded in the issue of April 8, 1922, and it reveals
the sweep of the local parson's mind when trained to
think in terms of the impending catastrophe :
God save the day, when, over the borders of hostile Mexico, shall
pour the yellow hordes of the Orient; When Dallas and San Antonio
shall become Oriental cities and heathen shrines shall take the place of
our Churches. I am not an alarmist and would not paint sensational
pictures. But the Jap is here. He has refused to assimilate. . . . You
laboring men! If racial equality ever comes you will have to work for
fifteen cents a day, eat chop suey and drink fish-fin soup.
We began by imagining evils and ended by creating
them. Not finding the actual menace of Rome, we
solicited the local Catholics to have their noses bloodied.
But our fear was first of all that vague sense of cosmic
uncertainty and jeopardy which had been in all times the
basis of religious emotion and behaviour. It was some
thing more malignant than patriotism that produced these
lines written under the name of Carl F. Hutcheson id
The Searchlight:
Patriots, view the hellish countenance of thousands of Knights of
Columbus and millions of members of the Roman Catholic Church! The
latter despise real Americanism, hate our government, hate you, Patriots 1
They class your mothers, sisters, and daughters as harlots, while the
former is the monstrous iron wheel which the Roman Catholic Church
hopes will crush America, American institutions and the purity of our
women for the sake of the Dago on the Tiber—the hope of the Roman
Catholic Church!
Patriots, if ever blood ran through your veins for pure American
womanhood, innocent and undefiled Southern womanhood, for the purity
of your home and household, let it run with a warmth that knows no
quenching! Yea, let your blood spurt fire!
If there must be war with the Roman Catholics, the Knights of
Columbus, and the hireling newspapers, editors and reporters, let it
come! We are ready!
I have said that the War was impersonal to the ma
jority of us Americans. It was a vague, far-off divine
event, and our hates were fired like shells from a Big
Bertha with the vicious prayer that they would destroy

an enemy we had never seen. We had all the pleasures of
war and none of its horrors. Our whole experience was
vicarious and unhealthy, what with our sacrifice in the
form of meatless days and service in the form of knit
ting socks. It was an enterprise essentially unreal to us,
yet it was necessary to the success of our participation
that we feel all the emotions of the actual combatants.
The state of mind this left us in is obvious from the state
of mind we expressed in Ku Kluxism. We were a na
tion mad upon divinity and hate. We conjured enemies
from behind hostile barns and laid upon them with that
strange and incomparable savagery which only reli
gious emotions can produce. We were tortured with
trumped-up fears for our country's welfare and obsessed
with the thought that we were the sons and daughters of
God.
This, then, is the story of the Klan. It was conceived
in a vision, born upon an altar, and dedicated to the de
liverance of a people. It was political and racial, to be
sure, but only because it was primarily religious in the
amazing program it set itself. With its pomp and regalia,
its solemn parades in the dead of night, its symbols and
its ritual, its sadistic revelries and baitings on behalf of
the Almighty, it was one thing above and beyond all: a
religion of the savage mind. It made eschatology of our
history, theology of our national ideals. If the student of
history would know the emotional traits of primitive re
ligion he could do no better than study the story of the
Klan during the period of its greatest influence, and if
he would know the shameless lengths to which hyper-
trophic religious behaviour can go, he need no longer
go back to the Middle Ages. Let him procure the docu
ments of the modern Klan.

XIII
THE LIBERAL CATHOLICS
At first blush, the Liberal Catholic Church seems an
ideal sanctuary for the intelligentsia. It appears to be
merely an attempt to keep intact the stately ritual and
sensuous beauty of the Roman Church while at the same
time junking the monstrous theology and fierce sacerdo
talism of that august body. It pays no more allegiance to
the Pope of Rome than does the Texas legislature. Most
of its priests are laymen in everyday life—not a few of
them being Freemasons —and the clergy make no claim
to ride the individual conscience. Non-members are in
vited to full participation in its services and allowed to
take its Sacraments —something which is not to be said
for, say, the Campbellites of Protestant faith. More
over, there "are no Liberal Catholic dogmas. . . . The
Church encourages intellectual freedom in the inter
pretation of its Teachings, the Creeds, Tradition and
Holy Scripture." And in spite of its arch heresies and its
willingness to fraternize with pariahs, it has a perfectly
sound episcopal succession, which even the Holy Father
cannot invalidate, however much he might like to do
just that. Really the Liberal Church has all the selling
features of the Church of Rome and, so it seems, not one
of the drawbacks.
It is scarcely out of its swaddling clothes, having been
born in 191 8, though its fetus was visible as early as 1916.
It is a daughter of the Old Catholic Church of Holland,
one of the several Catholic churches of the world which
pay no homage to the Holy See. The Old Catholics origi
nated in 1870 when the famous Vatican Council met at

Rome and lent its amazing definition to the doctrine of
papal infallibility. A considerable number of the Con
tinental Catholics, unable to stomach so gross a doctrine,
protested and were of course excommunicated. These
protestants organized themselves into congregations at
Munich in 1871, but found themselves in the embarrass
ing position of being without a shepherd, for no bishops
had joined the dissenting movement. Thus we had a body
calling itself the Old Catholic Church, but with no means
of handling on the Apostolic Succession, and any good
Catholic knows that that would never do. "The defect
fatal, of course, to any Catholic body unless somehow
supplied —was in this case made good by Hermann Hey-
dekamp, Jansenist Bishop of Deventer in Holland, who
apparently with the concurrence of the Church over
which he presided, consecrated on the 4th of June 1873
Dr. Reinkens, the Old Catholic nominee." 1
And if one asks where the Jansenists got their right to
stand in line with the apostles, one must go back to the
Seventeenth Century for an answer. The Dutch people,
with characteristic hospitality, gave sanctuary to a num
ber of Jansenist refugees who had fled from France and
Belgium to escape the Jesuit persecution there. As a re
sult, the Dutch Church was accused of complicity in the
Jansenist heresy and its Archbishop, Peter Coddle, was
deposed in 1704. Since that day the Dutch Church has
maintained its independence of Rome, though the mem
bers of
it,
too, were for
a
time without
a
shepherd. A cer
tain Bishop Varlet had been consecrated as Bishop of
Ascalon and coadjutor to the Bishop of Babylon. On the
evening of his consecration he learned of the death of
the Bishop of Babylon and therefore went at once to as
sume the directorship of that see. On his way out to Baby
lon, he passed through Holland, administering the sacra
ment to those awaiting confirmation there. This incurred
the deep displeasure of the Pope, so Varlet remained in
Holland the remainder of his life and consecrated four
bishops in the Dutch Church. It

3escent that the Old Catholic Church received the di
vine link with the original apostles when Reinkens was
consecrated a bishop of the Old Church in 1873.
The Old Catholics united with or were absorbed by
the Dutch Jansenist Church, and one of their bishops,
Arnold Harris Mathew, was made bishop of Great Brit
ain and Ireland in 1908. Bishop Mathew ordained a
group of young priests in the British Isles, but they, too,
found themselves ecclesiastically fatherless when Mathew
deserted to Rome in 191 5, and without any prospect of
the old Church in Holland's appointing "another father-
in-God to guide the destinies of the Old Catholic mission
in Great Britain." It happened, however, that before his
secession to Rome, Archbishop Mathew had consecrated
as his Bishop Auxiliary, "to safeguard the succession,"
Frederick Samuel Willoughby, formerly a priest of the
Anglican church. Bishop Willoughby was at this time
also on the point of making submission to the Holy See,
and again there was prospect of the lambs left without a
spiritual rod and staff. But before he went over to Rome
Willoughby did consecrate two Old Catholic priests, and
with these as assistants, consecrated the first Presiding
Bishop of the Liberal Catholic Church, though it was
not called that just yet. The members of the Old Church
in Great Britain took Mathew's desertion for Rome as
the opportunity to form themselves into an independent
body and by the consecration of James Ingall Wedge-
wood as first Presiding Bishop, that opportunity was
made good. They thus secured a valid succession and yet
had the pleasures of autonomy.
The time was ripe for the renaming of the daughter
church. The term Liberal Catholic was adopted after)
prolonged discussion in 1918
—"a term which, on the
whole, is about as true a description of the body for which
it stands as any label could be." And thus there came into
being one of the most curious bodies of modern Christen
dom, a church which opens apparently its sacred portals
to the sinners and publicans, and more scandalous still,
to free thinkers and creedal mugwumps, a Church with
a perfectly valid spiritual chain joining it to the twelve

apostles, yet free from the punctilios of usage which
have accumulated in the name of the Church since the
time of Nicea. A most amazing coup !
It
is,
unfortunately, not everything
it
is
cracked up to
be. Not content with basing its appeal upon frankly sensu
ous elements, using lights, incense, music, and intona
tions to produce
a
feeling somewhat akin to worship,
it
flies into realms we know not of, and when all
is
said
and done,
it
presents an eerie front, quite as dumbfound
ing as that of any cult under the canopy of God.
The Liberal Catholic Church was hardly weaned from
the mother faith when
it
began to grow creepy and blood
curdling. In 1916, long before its renaming, Presiding
Bishop Wedgewood left England for
a
visit to the dis
tinguished theosophical teacher, Charles W. Leadbeater,
of Krishnamurti fame, and this enchanted dreamer was
consecrated as Regionary Bishop of Australia. Here the
alliance between the Liberal Catholics and the Theoso-
phists began, and
it
has proceeded merrily ever since.
Just as the early Church went over to Rome, the Liberal
Church went over to spirit-mongering, with the result
that the high-sounding principles and liturgy of the Lib
eral body today contain as many mysterious gewgaws as
the cult of Oom the Omnipotent. The marriage of the
Church and the Society was doubtless aided and abetted,
if
not planned, by the designing Mother Besant, whose
enemies have too often been accused of inclining toward
the Pope. At any rate Bishop Wedgewood and his illus
trious colleague began the erection of the liturgy of the
Liberal Catholic Church on the visit of the Presiding
Bishop to Australia in 1916 and completed
it
two years
later. It was modeled after that of Rome and has since
been filled with the ghosts of Theosophy, so that not much
as an article remains without
a
spooky and cryptic refer
ence of one sort or another.
The church continued to grow and prosper in every
clime. In 1917 Bishop Wedgewood made an evangelic
pilgrimage to America, where he founded the body on
our soil, and

may add, one of
the most charming speakers
I
have ever heard expound
the doctrine.
Today the Liberal Catholic Church
is
well established,
with regionary bishops and moderately good congrega
tions in Australia, England, America, Java, New Zea
land, South Africa, and Holland. In 1923, after the re
tirement of Wedgewood, Leadbeater was duly elected
by his brother bishops as the second Presiding Bishop of
the Church. Perilous times followed for the young
church, "but such was the strength of its leaders, and
especially of its great Presiding Bishop," the church
weathered the gale. Attacks were launched upon its good
name, and upon the good name of Bishop Leadbeater,
but the crisis passed and today the body shows that hard
ening of the arteries which marks the final establishment
of every good church.

Bishop Pigott defines the Liberal Catholic religion as
a
"blend of theosophical mysticism and Catholic sacra-
mentalism." It seems, in the judgment of the Reverend
Edmund Sheehan, "an answer to the inarticulate cry of
millions groping for spiritual light:
a
mission sent out
into the world to guide Christianity again to
a
knowl
edge of those spiritual truths which will place its teach

law." 2
Those spiritual truths, I take
it,
are the funda
mentals of the Ancient Wisdom, for the Church
is
tied
inseparably to the apron strings of Madame Blavatsky
and the doctrines she revealed. In line with this belief,
the potentates of the Liberal Catholic Church hold that
the Sacraments are reducible to demonstrable formulae
and that one can examine their actual results. The Lib
eral Church claims to be in accord with modern science
because
it
knows the science of the spirit world.
To make what
I
mean unmistakably clear,
I
can do no
better than to give in brief review the high astounding
arguments set forth by Leadbeater in his book, The Sci
ence
of
the Sacraments. This book
is
described by the
headquarters of the Church as the "first comprehensive
volume sent out into our modern civilization, which ex
plains the inner workings of the spiritual forces of the
ancient Catholic Ceremonies." The book
is
regarded by
the Sanhedrin as "scientific, because
it
is
the testi
mony of
a
great physicist of the spiritual worlds to the
things which he has observed, and with which in all
reverence he has experimented." The sacraments, so the
belief of the Liberals runs, can be scientifically studied
and their efficacy gauged in terms of spiritual atoms.
Leadbeater,
it
cannot be too emphatically pointed out,
claims to have observed with the naked spiritual eye all
that he has recorded.
It should be remarked—indeed,
it
cannot be forgot
ten—that the whole trend and verve of the Liberal
Church
is
to fill the old-time religion with astral mean
ing. It feels that Christianity, since its origins lay in Bud
dhism,
is
not wholly worthless, and should not be lost
to this enlightened age. Jesus was "permitted to yield up
his body for the use of
a
Mighty Teacher sent out by
the Great White Brotherhood to found
a
new religion."

This Great One "took possession of His body when he
was twenty-nine years old," and since he was, like Zo
roaster and Krishnamurti, the vehicle of the World

iTeacher, it is obvious that his Sacraments, if restored to
their original purity, have some meaning for our age.
Mrs. Besant tells us that at the age of nineteen Jesus went
to an Essene monastery near Mount Serbal, a place much
visited by learned men travelling from Persia and India
to Egypt. There reposed in this monastery one of those
British Museum affairs containing the ancient wisdom:
it was here that "a magnificent library of occult works —
many of them of India and the Trans-Himalayan re
gions—had been established." The lad Jesus knew, there
fore, the holy mysteries of the East before he returned
to the village of Nazareth and announced himself the
fulfillment of prophecy. Indeed he was "initiated in
Egypt as a disciple of that one Sublime Lodge from
which every great religion has its founder." *
It is per
fectly evident, so the Bishop and Mrs. Besant feel, that
Jesus got his stuff from Buddhistic sources and formu
lated it into a working creed, of which the Nicean, Atha-
nasian, and Apostles' Creeds are garbled and spurious
forms. He also made provision for a system of sacraments
through which he could empty his grace and energy out
upon his followers, and it is these sacraments which the
Bishop has sought to clarify and free of their specious
elements. The holy eucharist, for example, is not merely
a means of grace for the individual, but it is also a "plan
for helping on the evolution of the world by the fre
quent outpouring of floods of spiritual force." Thus it is
that mass said at Fiftieth Street and Fifth Avenue, New
York, has the power of clarifying the atmosphere of a
wicked city and of making uncomfortable the shades of
departed murderers who may be lurking about to inspire
others to foul and bloody deeds.
Spiritual force comes into the world through inter
mediate powers, and it is the business of these powers to
economize that force and distribute it well. "It would be
distinctly wasteful to put it down indiscriminately every
where like rain," for the obvious reason that such profli
gacy would "require the effort of its materialization to
a lower level at thousands of places at once." Christ and

his partners in the Great White Brotherhood are for
ever ready to put out these blessings upon mankind, but
they require, with a view to efficiency, that man ''estab
lish at certain points definite magnetic centres, where the
machinery of such materialization may be permanently
arranged, so that, when the force is distributed from
above, it can be at once distributed without the unneces
sary waste in the construction of unnecessary machin
ery."
B
All this, and infinitely more, the Bishop has shown to
be scientifically sound. He is convinced, not as a saint
but as an explorer of the unseen, that "through the cere
mony of the Eucharist, each time it is celebrated, there
passes forth into the world a wave of peace and strength,
the effect of which can hardly be overrated." 8
And here
the marvels of the mysteries begin. Not only does the
eucharist transmit a shock of spiritual vitality to man
kind, but it erects a, shall we say, visible bit of machinery
for the work in hand. Not visible, that
is,
to the untrained
eye, but sufficiently visible to Bishop Leadbeater so that
he has supplied his book with twenty-seven plates, rang
ing from simple diagrams to elaborate ectoplasmic photo
graphs, all illustrating the actual thought-form or eu-
charistic edifice which
is
erected by that sacred ceremony
when conducted by the Liberal Catholic Church. In fact,
the liturgy of the Liberal Church has been carefully de
signed with
a
view to getting the best possible thought-
form when the thing
is
done. It
is
able,
I
may add at the
risk of anticipating the story, to erect
a
bulbous form of
rare beauty and texture, taking the shape of an immense
super-cathedral, above the church where the eucharist
is
given—provided of course that the whole performance
goes off well. And
if
the congregation will but co-operate
with the clergy, they can not only build this super-cathe
dral of thought-substance by the service, but they can
advance their own evolution rapidly and distinctly
ameliorate the "mental and moral atmosphere of the
city in which they live." Christ and the Adepts have

provided an immense reservoir of spiritual force in the
skies and made every arrangement for the priests to
tap it.
But back to the bubble. This edifice—a thin vaporous
and variously coloured affair which first encompasses
then transcends the church building —is compounded of
matter belonging to the various Theosophical planes —
mental, astral, and etheric. And at a later stage of the
service, "the matter of still higher levels is introduced."
At low celebration the material for the building of it is
provided by the thought and devotion of the priest, aided
by that of his congregation, if he has any, but at high
celebration "the music and other accessories play a
prominent part in its erection." The words and thoughts
and feelings of the priest are still a controlling force,
however, "and in all cases there is a certain amount of
angelic guidance and assistance."
The truth of the business is that so many factors enter
into its manufacture "that there is room for wide differ
ence in size, style, decoration and colouring, but the gen
eral plan is always recognizably the same. It suggests the
shape of a basilica." 7
It is said that the well known
Church of Santa Sofia at Constantinople "was erected in
imitation of one of these spiritual edifices." If one can
imagine that church made of clear blue gelatin and set
down firmly upon a smaller earthly church, until the
earthly church merely resembles the filling of the gela
tin, that will afford a fair idea of the eucharistic edifice.
"The completed structure is usually approximately
square in ground plan, with a number of recessed open
ings of doors on each of its four sides, crowned by a large
central dome, with sometimes smaller domes or some
times minarets at its corners." 8
At the risk of making the thought a nuisance, I must
repeat that this thought-form is said by the learned bishop
actually to have being—atomic being. He claims to be
able to see it with the trained eye of his inner being and
if anyone fails to see
it,
that one simply hasn't been trained

to see the inside of things which are often "far greater,
and more glorious than the outer."
The Roman liturgy is capable of a comparable stunt
in ether, but the finished result isn't so good. There are,
according to the Liberal Catholics, many passages which
debase man —such as the imprecatory prayers and the
constant references to sin—which mar the beauty of the
service and exercise "a distinctly prejudicial effect upon
this spiritual architecture." The service used by the
Church of England is "sadly maimed and truncated."
This is due to the heavy-handed work of the reformers
who obviously knew nothing of the intent and possibili
ties of the ritual with which they tampered. In conse
quence, though the orders of the Church of England are
conceded to be valid and its priests "therefore have the
right to draw upon the great reservoir of spiritual force,
the edifice which she builds for its reception is singu
larly imperfect." This imperfect structure is not serious
enough to prevent the outpouring, but "it diminishes the
amount available for radiation, because much of the
force has to be expended by the Angel-helpers in con
structing machinery which should have been prepared
for them by us." 9
There is in the Liberal Catholic Church no such woe
ful wear and tear on the angels, for its ritual is carefully
designed with a view to perfecting the spiritual ma
chinery through which showers of blessings, to use the
Methodist phrase, are drawn upon the waiting commu
nicants. "The whole ritual is aimed at rightly building
this form, charging it with divine force, then discharg
ing
it,
and each canticle or recitation contributes its share
to this work." Each large division of the service makes its
contribution toward the completed edifice
;
one part lays
the foundation, another—just as though
it
were done by
a
construction company in the modern business world —
comes along and does its bit, and so on until we have
a
creamy Santa Sofia which no one can see. As Bishop
Leadbeater puts it:

This gigantic thought-form is gradually built up during the earlier
portion of the service. . . . The edifice swells up from below like a
bubble that is being blown, Broadly speaking, it may be said that the
opening Canticle provides its pavement and the Introit the material
for its walk and roof, while the Kyrie supplies the subsidiary bowls
or cupolas, and the Gloria the great central dome.10
The Bishop and his colleague started to build, they
claim, a liturgy which would remove the grey of fear
and the brown of selfishness from the colours in the edi
fice. They fairly well succeed in doing this, as well as in
their other aspiration, namely, to "change the style of its
architecture from classical to Gothic."
Those who think for one moment that this scientist
of the other world contents himself with general assump
tions and prudently avoids committing himself to details
are sadly mistaken. After sketching the plan of the edi
fice in general, he proceeds to offer blueprints of its every
niche and cranny. To begin with, the interior of the
church itself must be purified at the opening of the serv
ice. Vagrants have wandered in during the week, and it
is quite possible that evil thoughts have been loosed
within the sacred walls. At any rate, it is well to clear
the atmosphere and fill it with lovely thoughts before
the service gets under steam. One instrument for this
fumigation is incense, which carries a "purifying and
uplifting force wherever its fragrance penetrates." The
hymn, too, has its values, for it superinduces a harmoni
ous vibration in the atmosphere. And it is rather desir
able that the processional be extended into a perambula
tion around the church. When these preliminaries are
completed, the edifice begins to rise.
The celebrant all the while aids in clearing the church
of worldly thought by means of the asperges. He sprin
kles the altar thrice, "as it is especially necessary that this
part of the Church be carefully prepared for the recep
tion of the tremendous spiritual force which is soon to
radiate from it." The purification is produced less by the
falling drops than by the will of the "priest directing

the energy stored in the magnetized water." He can throw
this force in any direction, and immediately following
his movements, the force flows in the direction indicated.
When aimed at the people, this force travels "way down
to the end of the church, no matter how large it may be":
The outrush blows what looks like a vast bubble of etheric, astro-
mental matter, a thought-edifice, ethereal, diaphanous, a bubble which
just includes the congregation. Inside this the psychical atmosphere is
purified, the bubble pushing back that which has not been effected. In
this way an area is cleared for the operations of the Angel who will
presently be invoked.11
The congregation sings the laist Psalm and the bubble
blown by the priest is strengthened, enlarged, and en
riched. Everything is now in readiness for the Angel.
There are "many orders and races of the radiant non-
human spirits," says the Bishop, but they are not always
as concerned with the doings of mankind as, say, the
angels of the Swedenborgian heaven. Not every angel
goes to church. There are certain types, however, who are
inclined toward religion and quite willing to take part
in religious ceremonies, not only for the pleasure of do
ing a good turn but because it offers the best possible op
portunity for progress in cosmic evolution. So the priest
never calls in vain. One of the advantages conferred by
ordination is ready access to these celestial creatures. At
last one is secured, and this Angel acts as architect in the
structure to be undertaken. He must guard all details,
and his first act is to expand the bubble. What tremendous
responsibility rests upon his shoulders may be seen by
the statement of Bishop Leadbeater: "If too large a pave
ment were built at the singing of the Canticle, the
Eucharistic edifice when complete might be so atten
uated as scarcely to hold together." A good angel will
see that no such catastrophe occurs, but will shape the
whole affair beneficently, in order not to play a joke
upon the priest and the people. Havoc might be wrought
in these circumstances by an angel with a sense of hu
mour.

The angel next proceeds to lay a large mosaic floor,
its extent and colouring depending entirely upon the
amount of enthusiasm and concentration the people of
the congregation manifest. The depth of the foundation
"depends upon the material available; at a well-attended
High Celebration, the pavement may be as much as a
yard in thickness, its upper surface coinciding with the
floor of the Church." As a general rule rich colours pre
vail in this mosaic foundation, but where the congrega
tion "includes many instructed and unselfish people,
radiant and delicate tints of azure and rose may be
seen." la
By the end of the introit the bubble has become a rather
substantial affair —to all appearances a large cake of
ice placed firmly on a toy church. At the end of the kyrie,
there are nine bulbs on top of the ice ; then comes the low
dome, resulting "from the swelling of the central bowl
during the first paragraph of the Gloria." Traces of the
four surrounding bowls are still visible. The dome is fur
ther swelled during the second paragraph of the gloria
and a Gothic spire is put on top of it all by the last para
graph. The four corner bowls remain as cupolas.
And there you are!

That, in brief and according to the reasoned utterances
of the Presiding Bishop, is what happens during the
Liberal Catholic mass. And while that body has the vir
tue of never enforcing its dogmas, certainly the mysteries
could not be greater if one had to believe in them. Its
chief appeal. I believe, lies in the direction of keeping
discreetly quiet about its mysteries and laying its loudest
emphasis upon the freedom it proclaims. A poet or a
lecher might drop into a Liberal Catholic mass and be
rather well impressed by its form and stateliness. He
might well hear the suave and convincing Bishop Cooper
and decide at once that here was his sanctuary. But once

to" the ethereal essence of the sacraments, at least a good
portion of potential converts are for ever frightened off.
What the Liberal Catholic Church does in truth is sub
stitute its own superstitions for the superstitions of the
Church of Rome. Which is well and good, for it would
not be a religion if it did not introduce something posi
tive and at the same time doubtful about the vast "un
seen world about us." It would be foolish and impos
sible to deny any cult its fantasies. Whatever its outward
form, or its propaganda, a sect is known by its mysteries.
I will pass in brief review the other tenets of the faith
—almost all of them the same as the doctrines of Theos-
ophy. The cult makes much of science and freedom, yet
it has its dogmas, and if it did not, it would last about as
long as a third-rate literary society in Harvard. In con
nection with the apostolic succession, it teaches that "it is
not possible for a layman to don the priestly vestments,
perform the ritual and call down from heaven the spirit
ual power." Such a layman, if truly consecrated, could
get some response from heaven, but not the full measure
of blessing from the holy eucharist. "The power to do
that," says Sheehan, "is conferred only at ordination,
when the candidate for the priesthood is spiritually
linked with Christ, and is specially prepared to call down
and transmit spiritual forces." 1S
The efficacy, then, of
the Liberal Catholic scheme of worship, free as it may be
to the general public, rests upon the assumption that
Jesus conferred upon his disciples a peculiar spiritual
power, which they in turn passed to the bishops of the
Holy Catholic Church. "Furthermore," says Sheehan,
"people who are sensitive to spiritual influences can prove
the reality of the Apostolic Succession by their spiritual
experiences of the sacramental administrations of the
Liberal Catholic clergy."
Such a belief is not strange, save in the light of liberal
claims advanced by the cult we are discussing. The more
one gets into the doctrine and teaching of the body, the
more obvious it becomes that the Liberal Catholic

Church is more catholic than liberal. The feeling pre
vails that Christ necessarily instituted the sacraments as
a channel through which he could drench the world with
goodness and love after his physical body was no longer
usable: "thus the performance of a prescribed ritual;
thus the spiritual link between Christ and His ministers:
thus the consecrating of bread and wine: thus the vest
ments, the candles, the holy water and the incense, which
are not only symbolical, but utilitarian." 14
It is of course unnecessary to believe any of the doc
trines to participate in holy communion. The authorities
of the church feel that they should not keep from the
fold all who have not yet seen truth with the naked eye,
therefore they are tolerant of outsiders. It holds that "be
lief should be the result of individual study, not its ante
cedent." It gladly welcomes into its ranks "all who are
still seeking for truth." It makes no effort to proselyte;
rather it allows free communion at its altars to members
of any other church, and its congregations, it is claimed,
are recruited mostly of men and women who have ceased
to attend church. "On the other hand, if members of other
churches are attracted by the distinctive features of its
work, no obstacle is placed in the way of uniting with
itself. . . ." Candidates are admitted by baptism, or if
that has been duly performed, by confirmation. Where
both sacraments have been validly administered, the
process of getting in is simple. For the baptismal rite they
use water for absolution, the Trinitarian formula, to
gether with the application of the oil of catechumens and
the chrism.
It makes deliberate use of art as a spiritualizing in
fluence, regarding beauty as of special value to the masses,
for they have little of spiritual moment in their lives. Its
churches are therefore attractive and worthy of study by
most Protestant bodies. Its clergymen receive no stipend
for their labours, nor is a fee exacted for the administer
ing of the sacraments. The brethren are free to marry or
be celibate as they please. The possibilities of healing by
use of the sacred oil are only vaguely emphasized, though

the belief is expressed under the imprimatur of Bishop
Leadbeater that "bodily ailments are in many cases the
outcome of inner maladies of the soul, and in any case
can be best remedied when the soul is at peace."
Nowhere is the teaching of the church more benign
and positive than in regard to death. Bishop Leadbeater
claims to have the lowdown on the life beyond, and he
is as familiar with the topography of heavenly places as
Swedenborg ever dared to be. He feels that the gloomy
view of death expressed by the older churches is "out
of date and out of harmony with the facts. ... It takes
no account of the result of modern discoveries : it main
tains exploded theories in the face of reason and science."
Life after death is no longer a mystery. The world beyond the grave
exists under the same natural law as this which we know, and has been
explored and examined with scientific accuracy.15
Matters affecting us so gravely as our whereabouts
after death are too important to be left to guesswork.
Hence careful investigations have been undertaken and
accurate tabulations made.
Death is not the end of life, as we have ignorantly assumed, but is
only a step from one stage of life to another.
Death makes no change in man. He is just the same the
day after death as he was the day before, with the negli
gible difference that he has lost his physical body. This,
however, has its compensations:
It means freedom from the possibility of pain and fatigue: free
dom also from all irksome duties: entire liberty (probably for the first
time in his life) to do exactly what he likes.
In this spiritual world no money is necessary, food and shelter are
no longer needed, for its glory and beauty are free to all its inhabitants
without money and without price.
It does behoove one, however, to select his pleasures
prudently in the life here below, for on these he must rely
for his enjoyment in the world to come.

Whatever has been his particular delight on earth—his hobby, as we
should say—he has now the fullest liberty to devote himself to it en
tirely and to follow it out to the utmost, provided only that its enjoy
ment is that of the intellect or the higher emotions—that its gratifica
tion does not necessitate the possession of the physical body.
What these heavenly pastimes could be, the Bishop
does not intimate. But he does go on to say that "all ra
tional and decent men are infinitely happier after death
than before it."
Certainly no cult is quite so worth hearing about for the
first time. It would seem that here at last is a deliberately
and objectively planned effort to "play church" on a large
and adult scale. I am not so sure but that the country is
ready for just that, and if so, some messiah will come out
of California to start in. Despite what "Dick" Sheppard
has to say about "taking Jesus seriously," observation con
firms me in the belief that that is just what Americans
are tired of doing. We are much too prone to take our
religion, if not seriously and to heart, at least serious-
mindedly. Thus we cannot have a church, a Catholic
church with freemasons for priests, without yanking into
the ritual a cloud of phantasmagoria and commandeering
a roving angel for the conduct of the service.
All of which strikes the average urbanized yokel of

preferred than the unsanitary and highblown absurdities
of a Methodist love-feast. What our sophisticated and
thoroughly disenchanted age wants is a religion which
will be confessedly no religion at all. We want to play
church, just as we did when we were children. In those
days we did not think of God when we played, nor were
we worried by the fact that the dresser was not an actual
altar. It gave us no pause to use an almanac for a hymnal,
or to drink milk for holy wine. There was a certain plain
honesty about it all which would take well with us
adult infants today. A church which made no bones about
its orders, which taught no ethic save the opinion of its
clergymen, which attributed no divine power to its sacra
ments, but sought in all details to make its service sensu

THE SWAMIS AND YOGIS
THE emissaries of India have had a rich and florid
time with us since the day of Swami Vivekananda. He
was the first and greatest zealot of the East to offer up
the Hindu mysteries in palatable form for American con
sumption. In 1893 he came, clad in the loud regalia of
his office, and settling with sublime naivete in one of Chi
cago's richest hotels to await the opening of the Par
liament of Religions. His followers in India had chosen
him with great pride during the previous spring as their
representative, and he had sailed almost immediately
from Japan. From Vancouver, where he landed, he came
by train to Chicago —robbed at every step of his journey,
'tis said by his biographers. He passed the time in a state
of joyous excitement as he beheld for the first time the
wonders of Western civilization and for a period he for
got his meditations. He landed in Chicago without
friends and with no place to go. His dress made him con
spicuous and gamins followed him through the station
and shouted after him. On all sides was a swarm of peo
ple, chiefly visitors from every part of the democracy to
the World's Fair, then open. Burdened with possessions,
he looked helplessly about until some shrewd porter gath
ered him up and placed him in a fashionable hostelry.
There he sat down in the middle of his luggage, after
paying exorbitant charges to his Samaritan, and tried to
recapture the Oriental art of meditation, which had been
his one consolation in byways of far-off Hindustan.
The next day he set out to visit the World's Fair—he
who had lived the life of an outcast monk in India. He
was struck speechless by the wonders that he saw and
roused to the highest pitch of enthusiasm by this minia

ture of the Western World. Gradually he became ac
quainted in Chicago, and it was not long of course until
the reporters found him. There happened to be a famous
rajah at the fair and there happened also to be a low-
caste Indian who started a scandal of large dimensions
over the rajah, saying among other things that the po
tentate belonged to one of the lowest orders of Indian
society and that he passed in America merely because the
people were gullible. The papers needed something more
than a carnival freak to validate the story, so, with that
ingenuity that has always marked Yankee enterprise, they
credited the story of Swami Vivekananda. Whatever else
the ruse may have done, it got the Swami before the
public eye, and he had attained the first prerequisite of
success in the land of the West.
The Swami's predicament in Chicago was soon compli
cated by the fact that his funds were running low. He dis
covered to his great dismay that the Parliament he had
come to attend would not open until September. It was
now July; moreover, he was told at headquarters that he
would not be received when the Parliament did convene,
for he was without credentials and only those delegates
properly accredited in the American way would be ad
mitted.
Broken-hearted, the monk of India set out for Boston.
Just why, I do not know, save that Boston, like lower
California, has always offered promise to religionists of
every variety. And the step was well taken. On the train
he was observed by a kindly old lady who thought it
would be nice to have an Oriental in her home, bedecked
as he was in the quaint and lurid garb of the East, and
she immediately invited him to make his headquarters
at her mansion. This the Swami was only too glad to do,
and the result was that he was invited to speak before the
Ladies' Club of Boston, and there achieved no mean suc
cess. Harvard professors took a lively interest in the man,
and when the time came, Professor J. H. Wright dis
patched him once more for Chicago, with full creden
tials and with the address of a friend.

THE SWAMIS AND YOGIS 299
Overjoyed, Swami Vivekananda started for the Par
liament of Religions. He discovered, however, when he
got off the train in Chicago, that he had lost the address
to which he had been committed. No one could instruct
him. He spoke English too imperfectly to be understood
in the foreign section where he found himself and his
jeopardy was heightened by the fact that the Chicagoans
took him for a Negro. In desperation he finally spent the
night as a true monk, sleeping in a huge box which he
found near the railway yards. The next morning he arose
greatly refreshed and with the simplicity born of years
in the holy life of India, started begging bread from door
to door along millionaires' row on Lake Shore Drive.
This got him nothing, for the outraged servants merely
shut the door in his face. Thoroughly disheartened, he sat
down to meditate, and while he steeled himself in the
posture of deep thought, the door of a mansion across the
Drive opened and a kindly woman came out to greet him.
She inquired if he was a delegate to the Parliament of
Religions, took him into her home, and instructed the
servants to supply his every need. The name of his bene
factress was Mrs. George W. Hale, and from that mo
ment he made his headquarters at her home.
Once at the Parliament, he was thoroughly at home.
He was among the most colourful spectacles there and
he sounded a note which America was only too glad to
hear. The authorities learned soon enough to keep him as
the last speaker of the hour to make the people stay until
the end of the session. He could not walk across the plat
form without being cheered. The New York Herald said
of him: "He was undoubtedly the greatest figure in the
Parliament of Religions. After hearing him we feel how
foolish it is to send missionaries to this learned nation."
He closed his first address with these words :
May He who is the Brahma of the Hindus, the Ahura-Masda of the
Zoroastrians, the Buddha of the Buddhists, the Jehova of the Jews, the
Father in Heaven of the Christians, give strength to you to carry out
your noble ideas. The star arose in the East; it travelled steadily to
ward the West, sometimes dimmed and sometimes effulgent, till it made

a circuit of the world, and now again it is arising on the very horizon
of the East, the borders of the Sanpo, a thousand times more effulgent
than ever before.
One is likely to overestimate the influence of Swami
Vivekananda after reading the three large octavo vol
umes of his Life, prepared by loving disciples in the
East and the West.1 But it cannot be denied that he
brought news to the religious host of America. He was
the first heathen we had ever seen face to face, and it
struck us as rather marvellous that he ate and slept like
the rest of us and that he had ideas. He was the first shock
to our national religious egotism, and, since he was the
first, we rather liked his audacity and intelligence. He
came, too, at the time when the liberal movement in
America lay wrapped in swaddling clothes, and he
brought out of the East, this one wise man, rich gifts
to bestow upon the new babe. It will not be forgotten
that the New Thought had begun to spread among the
middle classes by this time, or that Christian Science was
represented at the Parliament, or that Unitarianism had
grown somewhat respectable. Swami Vivekananda gave
tremendous impetus to all of these movements and to the
humanistic emphasis in theology, for the one dogma
which he brought was the one we were most ready to
welcome, and that was the divinity of man. He was the
spirit of the new theology, for if we simmer all the mod
ernistic and New Thought concoction down to its base,
we find there nothing more than the simple idea the man
is not the worm that the old theology said he was.
After the Parliament, Swami Vivekananda was lion
ized by Chicago society, and it was not long afterward
that he began a far-flung lecture campaign. He seems to
have been received indulgently in all quarters, and most
enthusiastically in some. The Theosophists fought him
and the orthodox Christians would have none of him.
There were scandals aplenty. It is said by his followers
that young girls were hired to seduce him, but he re

mained uncontaminated and kept inviolate his monastic
vows; the girls would break down in his presence and
confess that they had been paid to make advances to him.
It is said also by his followers that many ladies were fas
cinated by the personality of the Swami and that not a
few of them actually proposed marriage. But still he re
mained a monk. It was reported by missionaries in India,
who despaired of the blow he had given the cause of
evangelical Christianity in America, that Mrs. Bagley,
wife of the former Governor of Michigan, had to dismiss
a servant girl on account of him. This he and friends of
Mrs. Bagley vigorously denied.
On the whole he turned out to be what we are in the
habit of calling a good sport. He met and talked with our
Robert Ingersoll and extended his activities into the
West. Here he was severely tested by cowboys, who in
quired if he could really concentrate so hard that noth
ing would bother him. He replied that he could and one
day while he sat meditating they proceeded to shoot up
the earth about him and send a few bullets perilously
close to his head. He told them later that he had been
unaware of the bullets, "having retreated into the inner
most." He was rewarded by being called a "right good
fellow." He held a long conversation with William
James, who later wrote him addressing him "Master."
In New York he established a Vedanta Society which has
been well maintained and extended. On the whole, he
left an impress upon the continent not to be discounted
by anyone who observes our ventures into unorthodoxy.
What he did chiefly was to prepare the way for a horde
of lesser figures who carried his mission far beyond the
point which he must have had in mind as the ultimate.
He was the apostle of Hinduism to the Gentiles, the
evangel of Oriental mysteries. It was his avowed purpose
to unify and synthesize the East and the West. Yet I do
not believe he would tolerate the concessions which Yo-
gananda and others make to us today. Only rarely did
he play to the grandstand; only on infrequent occasions
did he condescend or attempt to make the mysteries prac

tical. He did say to a crowd of college students: "Be
strong, my young men, that is my advice to you. I assure
you that you will be nearer to heaven by playing foot
ball than by a study of the Gita." Again he is reported to
have told his students: "You may have a Gita in your left
hand, but have a football in your right." These, how
ever, are the worst evidences of Americanism that I have
found. He simply made America India-conscious and he
did more than any of those who had preceded him to
make Hindu philosophy popular here. That was his pur
pose and his triumph. And that was his mistake. If his
shade is hovering about this country seeking reincarna
tion it must tremble with dismay and chagrin at the
lengths to which his fellow Indians have gone in the at
tempt to make us relish Hindu philosophy.
The philosophy he propounded has set the pace for
every one who has followed him to these shores. And the
palaver of Oom the Omnipotent and all others who have
had a following among upper classes is not unlike that
which Vivekananda delivered to the ladies of New York
during the winter of 1
895-1 896. The substance of these
lectures was later dictated to Miss S. E. Waldo (a rela
tive of Ralph Waldo Emerson), who was his chief aid
in New York. She came daily from Brooklyn, it is re
ported, to wash the Swami's dishes and cook his food
while he was established in his 39th Street house. His lec
tures set forth his interpretation of the Raja Yoga or Con
quering the Internal Nature. The Raja Yoga embodies
the results of long and patient inquiry on the parts of
Eastern mystics, who have investigated, studied, and gen
eralized the phenomena of religious behaviour. Swami
Vivekananda explains that the Raja Yoga does not, "after
the unpardonable manner of some modern scientists, deny
the existence of facts which are very difficult to explain.
It teaches that the goal of life is to "manifest this divinity
within, by controlling nature, internal and external." 2
All Indian philosophies, he declares, have one object
and "that is the liberation of the soul through perfec
tion." The ambition set before an American by the ex

ample of a Yogi is better than any ten courses in Pel-
manism. In describing the purposes of the philosophy,
Vivekananda says :
The Yogi proposes to himself no less a task than to master the whole
universe, to control the whole of nature. He wants to arrive at the point
where what we call "nature's laws" will have no influence over him,
where he will be able to get beyond them all.3
Or can we imagine the palpitation which must have
come to the Nineteenth Century club woman when the
Swami told her that she was a potential Yogi and fur
thermore :
When the Yogi becomes perfect, there will be nothing in nature not
under his control. If he orders the gods to come, they will come at his
bidding. All the forces of nature will obey him as slaves, and when
the ignorant see these powers of the Yogi they will call them mir
acles.4
There is hardly anything in the philosophy of Raja
Yoga that is not splashed upon a ten-league canvas. "One
peculiarity of the Hindu mind," says the Swami, "is that
it always inquires for the last possible generalization,
leaving the details to be worked out afterwards." We
Westerners are finicky over facts and we have allowed
many abstract systems to be demoralized by the intru
sion of unfavourable particulars. Not so in India. There
religion remains general, and it keeps its hold on the
people, for theology gets into trouble only when it gets
into detail. That is the way our mind works, but the
Swami teaches the reverse :
Behind all particular ideas stands a generalized and abstract principle.
Grasp it and you have grasped everything. It is a postulate of the
Raja Yoga that the external world is not the gross form of the in
ternal, that the finer is always the cause and the grosser the effect. . . .
One who has discovered and learned how to manipulate the internal
forces will get the whole of nature under his control.5
This marvellous control is to be attained through the
rite of concentration.

304 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
Nature is ready to give up her secrets if only we know how to
knock, to give her the necessary blow, and the strength and force
of the blow come through concentration. There is no limit to the
power of the human mind. The more concentrated it
is,
the more
power
is
brought to bear on one point, and that
is
the secret.8
The object, of course,
is
to reach the point where the
individual shall become
a
Yogi—one who
is
peculiarly
adept in the science of the Yoga and in consequence has
the machinery of all nature at his fingertips. And while
Swami Vivekananda set little store by the gods of all
religions and spoke with
a
certain lordly contempt of re
ligious dogma, he sets before us in this object
a
more
stirring religious motive than we have in the combined
theologies of Christendom. The basic function of religion
is
to make man
a
comfortable and prosperous citizen of
the universe; Christianity proposes only to offer him
the inner witness of the spirit that he
is
accepted of God
:
the Raja Yoga, disclaiming and discounting the religious
motive, proposes none the less to make man the king of
high heaven and the engineer of the cosmos. Instead of
triumph over sin the Yoga offers triumph over nature,
and with all due respect to Christian theologians, nature
is
a
more relentless enemy of man than the temptations of
the flesh.
If we may judge from the testimonials, what those who
follow the Swamis and Yogis want in the way of modern
religion
is
a
quick relief from neurasthenia and frustra
tion. Only that and nothing more. But that
is
enough for
a
great part of our dumb, driven population, who reach
during the course of each day
a
point of tension where
explosion
is
momentarily threatened. Most of us need the
calm, the bliss, the restorative solace that comes from
complete introversion and retreat into something that
shuts out the memory of subways and duties. The pastors
can only urge us to set aside
a
portion of the day for
prayer to God, but we have no art for prayer, and that;
is
what the Raja Yoga teaches us. It gives prayer
a
new
and more sophisticated name, lends
it
the benedictions of)
oriental antiquity, and brings to the person who embraces

it a method and. a science which modern America would
never think to contrive. It makes ancient practice mod
ern, and we welcome it. What we have today is nerves :
what we want is rest. Hindu philosophers and fakirs
working among us take full account of both and offer us
what we long most to have —temporary surcease from the
fascinating but at times maddening world in which we
live.
Swami Vivekananda suggested a daily sanctuary for
the performance of his ceremony of concentration. He in
vested it with blue lights and incense, suggesting that one
have a room in which one neither ate nor slept. It was
to be a place kept holy from the world: it was not to be
entered when one was cross or angry. His instructions to
his disciples were to bathe themselves and then enter it:
Place flowers therein. Burn incense morning and evening. Have
no quarrelling or anger or unholy thought in that room. By and by
there will be an atmosphere of holiness there and you will feel calmer
just by entering it.7
It is not sufficient that one merely withdraw and de
cide to meditate. What American would do that? The
Raja Yoga offers eight decisive steps leading to full ini
tiation, and these cannot be practised satisfactorily save
under the surveillance of an inspired teacher. Roughly
they are : Yama, in which the pupil masters himself, be
comes trustful and self-reliant and surrenders himself un
reservedly to God ; then comes Asana, a series of exercises
and postures designed to put the body completely at the
mercy of the mind ; Pratyahara, a method of making the
mind relentlessly introspective; Dharana, a process
through which concentration in its most boring aspect
is achieved; Shyana, or holy meditation upon lofty ideas;
and Samadhi, in which the individual rises at last to
complete super-consciousness and lives in a realm where
the ailments and limitations of the body exercise no in
fluence over him.
Through Asana, as we shall presently see, the Hindu
methods offer us every opportunity for the ritual of body

culture. They teach us the holiness of beauty, and make
a religious ceremony of lifting the face. Swami Vivc-
kananda tells us that there is not one muscle in the body
over which man cannot establish perfect control. "The
heart can be made to stop or go at bidding." 8
He cites the cases of the Hatha Yogis, in which the
achievement of bodily divinity is uppermost. These par
ticular Yogis simply determine never to fall sick, and
they never do. They are, says the Swami, "quite young
and fresh at one hundred and fifty, without one hair
turned grey." This achievement he sets before his stu
dents, and lays down for them a series of suggestions,
such as drinking cold water through the nose immediately
upon getting up in the morning. As a result of this "the
whole day your brain will be nice and cool and you will
never catch cold."
There is also in connection with Asana a process for
"purifying the nerves." This is accomplished by a certain
manner of breathing to be practised "before dawn, at
midday, in the evening, and at midnight." The air is
taken in carefully through the left nostril and blown out
through the right, with the result that by diligent prac
tise "in fifteen days or a month purity of nerves is at
tained."
Breathing properly is the best way to harmonize the
whole system —not merely that the lungs are developed
but rather that certain mystic fluids are distributed by
the process. It is well for the subject to take "Oom" or
any other sacred word "and let that word flow in and out
with the breath, rhythmically, harmoniously, and you
will find the whole body becoming rhythmical." Tired
nerves will be marvellously calmed by this rite and the
woman who is overtaxed by benevolent work during the
morning can easily restore her energy and vitality in five
minutes before she addresses the Mother's Club. Not only
so: the system will have its influence on the face at the
outset, for "harsh lines will disappear" and with calm
thoughts in the mind a calm expression will overspread
the countenance. Next, a beautiful voice will come.

THE SWAMIS AND YOGIS 307
And if one stays doggedly at the ritual of breathing,
the sacred fluid of Kundalini, having its residence at the
seat of the spinal column, will be aroused. When that
glad day comes, "the book of knowledge will be open.
No more will you need to go to books for knowledge:
your own mind will have become your book, containing
infinite knowledge."
*
It should be stated as clearly as possible before we de
scend a step deeper into the mysteries, that the purpose
of the Yogi or adept—which all of us may one day be
come —is to control nature by means of controlling what
is called Prana. Prana is one of what the Hindus regard
as the two elemental substances of the universe. It is at
best a composite name for a menagerie of elements that
we know little or nothing about. Swami Vivekananda
tells us that Prana manifests itself as motion, gravita
tion, magnetism in the cosmos and as nerve-currents and
thought-force in the body. It is a holy name for force,
for all force in the universe, "when resolved back into its
original state, is Prana." It is this substance which, if one
understood perfectly, "he would be able to move the
sun and the stars out of their places, to control everything
in the universe, from the atoms to the biggest suns, be
cause he would control the Prana." 10
When a man is meditating he is utilizing the Prana
to the uttermost, for the highest action of Prana is
thought. It happens occasionally that in the body the
supply of Prana gravitates more or less to one part, and
the balance is disturbed. Now when the balance is dis
turbed, "what we call disease is produced. To take away
the superfluous Prana or to supply the Prana that is want
ing, will be curing the disease."
There are conduits in the human body through which
this sacred substance is conducted, and the control over
these conduits must be the goal of one who would become
a Yogi. There are the Ida and the Pimgala currents,
flowing on either side of the spinal column, and there is
the Susumna, which is a passage through the centre of the

spinal column. The Yogi alone among men has the Su-
sumna open. When it opens "and when thought begins to
rise through
it,
we get beyond the senses, our minds be
come supersensuous, superconscious, we get beyond even
the intellect, where reasoning cannot reach." ll The
Swami believes that men who have made the great dis
coveries and revelations of humanity have stumbled into
this superconscious state for
a
moment or so and then re
turned to earth greatly chastened and inspired. Such
stumbling into
it
is
fraught with danger, however, and
may lead to grave mental disorders. What one needs
is
the steady and unfailing superconsciousness which takes
one into clouds far beyond all physical knowledge.
I
have cited enough to show the importance which
Swami Vivekananda taught us to attach to man. Our
American New Thought seems but
a
mild and sickly
way of stating this high fancy of the Hindu mystics.
"Man," says the Swami, "is higher than all animals, than
all angels; none
is
greater than man." Even the devas
(gods) are inferior to man, for they cannot attain free
dom save through human birth. Once one has gotten the
secret of the Raja Yoga and mastered the mystic sub

Governor Johnston of Oklahoma into the arcana while
on one of his jaunts through the South.
There was a crowd of possibly three hundred present
the night I heard Wassan discourse on achieving super-
cosmic-consciousness through an adroit manipulation of
the solar plexus. Somewhat to my surprise, the audience
was rather well divided between men and women, and
the group as a whole measured up fairly well with the
average middle class congregation. Some of the young in
tellectuals present seemed anxious to be hostile, but on
the whole the audience was indulgent and eager. Some of
the more obese ladies sat in yearning postures, yet the
attitude of the whole group was one of American curios
ity. All of us joined heartily in the sepulchral chants
with which the service was opened by the Yogi, who
demonstrated the supremacy of his diaphragm at the out
set by holding on to "Oom" longer than the rest of the
audience put together. Perhaps I am uncharitable, but
I do not think he had as good control of his breath as the
average small choir soprano. But let that pass. The chant
began, followed by a short concert by the Yogi on what
I took to be an occult flute, and with that the worship
feature was over and we settled down to hear the Yogi
and later to see him accomplish his superhuman feats.
He was a man of impressive stature and I had the hon
our of standing near him for a few moments before he
went forward to the platform. His garb was luxuriant—
a turban of golden cloth entwined about his pate and a
flowing robe of the same material hanging regally from
his ample shoulders. His bosom was encased in a sar
cophagus not unlike the dress shirt a banker wears on
occasions of state, and his whole chest and belly gave the
impression, largely through this latterday armour, of
pure power.
Though he spoke it with that original twist that makes
the speech of foreigners considerably more expressive
than our own, his English was not among his charms.
He held forth at length and not without flashes of hu
mour, on the Yoga philosophy, a sketch of which I have
set forth above. His heaviest emphasis lay upon the solar

plexus, which he seemed to regard as the central mani
festation of divinity in man, and he told us that if we
mastered the art of breathing it would be nothing for us
to live two hundred and fifty, three hundred, or even
five hundred, years. He laboured the idea that we are
allotted a certain number of breaths during a lifetime
and if we are careless enough to use them all up by snif
fing the air or growing excited or nervous, we should die
young. But if we practised the control of the sacred fluids
by means of interminable and infrequent breaths, we
should have longevity. Methuselah, and others in the
Christian Bible, he said, were Yogis in that they knew
how to_ string life out over a long period. He referred to
his own teachers and to Yogis he had known in India
and safely cited their stunts as examples to us sedentary
Americans gaping incredulously before him.
Not only would man have longevity if he mastered the
solar plexus. He would be free from disease and nerv
ousness. He could eat anything —even peach seeds —and.
they would have no effect upon him. That, suggested the
Yogi, would help in cutting down living expenses. Dur
ing the course of his speech he took the chance to refer to
the courses of lessons at ten dollars each which he was
preparing to give and to promise the crowd a further elu
cidation of the arcana once they had signed up for the
course. He referred also to his Chandler automobile.
As a good fellow, Yogi Wassan struck me as thor
oughly up to par. As a Yogi, he was a sideshow freak. Yet
his influence throughout America has been enormous, and
his courses in New York are attended by people who
speak high praise of his occult knowledge. He capped
the climax of the evening by the stunt that he had ad
vertised in the papers. He had promised us to hold fifty
men at once on his diaphragm. That feat was a rather
pitiable spectacle. As many men as could be induced by
the cajolery of the Yogi and his fair assistants were lined
up in a row and the Yogi placed himself solidly against
the wall of the platform. When all was in apparent readi
ness, the head lady gave the signal and the line heaved

recorded. The line broke in at least four places and the
(Yogi held the weight of perhaps three men for as many
seconds. Another attempt was made, quite good-
naturedly, but with the same outcome.
My own experience is worth setting down, for it is open
to dual interpretation. Highly susceptible to suggestion
of any sort, I had become throughout the sermon in
tensely conscious of my stomach. I could not help won
dering if I were giving it a fair deal and I naturally
concluded as the Yogi wore on that I wasn't. I felt some
pangs of malaise at the close of the performance and at
about two o'clock in the morning following, I awoke
with a great feeling of nausea. I had just suffered a fright
ful dream in which the Yogi pursued me from mountain
to mountain seeking, as I remember, to cast an evil spell
over my bowels. He had undoubtedly succeeded, for I
was a sick man. I attempted to relieve myself by various
devices and at last fell fainting into my bed again. I was
ill the remainder of the night and until perhaps three
o'clock the next afternoon.
I dislike spoiling a perfect case of abnormal religious
experience, but in fairness I must say that, upon leaving
the Yogi's sanctuary I had eaten a number of sandwiches,
supplemented by dill pickles and washed down by gin
ger ale. Even as I write of this experience my stomach
tosses about uneasily. Yet the eating cannot explain the
whole of
it,
for my two companions who were with me

It remained, however, for the ineffable Swami Yogan-
anda to sell Hindu philosophy to Americans by Ameri
can methods and upon the basis of Yankee desire and
ambition. The names I have already cited need not
frighten the reader. They are commonly assumed by man
and woman to give a touch of authority to their esoteric
teachings. Swami simply means teacher,12 and if we shake
down the Hindu names, we commonly find that the men
who took on these names were once called Smith, Heath,
Falkner. The name of Oom Omnipotent was Peter A.
Bernard, and he was a professional baseball player before
he was an adept. In the early days when Swami Vive-
kananda was here, Madame Marie Louise, a noted New
York atheist and freethinker, embraced the Hindu doc
trine and called herself after that Swami Abhayandanda.
Leo Landsberg, who, before he took his vows of poverty
and chastity of the order to which Vivekananda belonged,
was a New York newspaper man; later he became Swami
Kripananda. And William Walker Atkinson, who has
turned out some of the most insufferable blah on the sub
ject of the Hatha Yoga philosophy, has signed the same
with the name of Yogi Ramacharaka.
Swami Yogananda made his appearance in America
first in 1920, when he came to Boston to attend the Inter
national Congress of Religions. The first Yogoda Sat-
Sanga Centre in America was of course organized in
Boston. Now Yogananda's headquarters is in lower Cali
fornia, where stands the Mount Washington Centre of
Yogoda and Sat-Sanga. Yogoda means in plain Ameri
12 A more elaborate explanation is offered by the Swamis, who interpret
the term to mean "Master" and assert that it can be bestowed only on a
qualified disciple by one who is himself a Swami, tracing his title through a
line of successive Swamis back to the 7th Century, A.D., when the ancient
order of Swamis in India was reorganized.

can a system which "teaches one to harmonize all the
faculties and forces that operate for the perfection of
mind, body, and soul." Sat-Sanga simply means "fel
lowship with Truth." He now claims twenty thousand
devoted students of the system, with centres in eight lead
ing American cities, and an active bi-monthly magazine.
Not least among the celebrities who have seen in Yo-
goda an earnest of the millennium is to be numbered the
late Luther Burbank. It is the plan of the Swami Yo-
gananda to establish "How To Live Schools" through
out the world, and these agencies, in the opinion of Mr.
Burbank, "will come as near bringing in the millennium
as anything with which I am acquainted." Other in
dorsements, however, are infinitely more personal. Luigi
yon Kunits, conductor of the New Symphony Orchestra
of Toronto, speaks of Yogoda's effect upon him in such
terms that one is led to wonder why he still wastes the
fragrance of his talent on Canadian air or blushes unseen
in the obscure city of Toronto: "Youthful energy that
spurns fatigue, an almost complete immunity from sick
ness and disease, intellectual alertness, steady firmness
and decision in willing and acting, truly remarkable
quickening of the receptive and retentive powers of mem
ory, and a constantly progressing calmness and mental
tranquillity" are among the benefits which von Kunits as
signs to the use of the Swami Yogananda's system of har
monizing the faculties of body, mind, and soul. To Vla
dimir Rosing, director of the Rochester American Opera
Company, Yogoda has "opened the great temple of
knowledge and truth": and this after years of searching
and when he was beginning to despair of ever finding
"the real truth of life." He testifies: "It has taught me
the spiritual contact of Cosmic Vibration, and it has given
me new hope, new strength, new inspiration in my artistic
work." Mme. Galli-Curci says: "Yogoda gives Health,
Strength, Power to Accomplish, Peace and Poise." To
this galaxy should be added the name of Louis Van Nor
man, formerly editor of Nation's Business.

note, too, the manner in which it is offered to the Ameri
can public. It is advertised as a system of bodily perfec
tion for "the busy but aspiring Western peoples." It has
the peculiar versatility of being able to reduce the obese
or fatten the skinny, and its mystical power is such that
it will even work while one is asleep. It is what might be
called the religion of the body, the creed of self-beauti-
fication, for it proposes to remove the lines of weariness
from the face and vitalize the whole being with radiant
energy and health. It employs no devices or mechanical
instruments but "uses the WILL TO RECHARGE THE body-
BATTERY FROM THE COSMIC LIFE-CURRENT and thus pro
duces a FATIGUELESS STATE." It can be practised "ANY
WHERE, ANY TIME, sitting, standing, or lying down, by
everyone, whether old or young, sick or well, weak or
strong. IT PUTS ON OR REMOVES FAT, just as desired. . . .
It teaches the SPIRITUALIZATION OF THE BODY." And now
let the sound and convincing American advertisement
continue this chronicle of feats.
It also includes the Highest Technique of Meditation and Con
centration by the psychophysiological methods taught by the great
Saints and Sages of India. How to see the Vital Force and hear the
Cosmic Vibration. How to attain perfect Fulfillment of all Desires thru
CONTACTING COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS. The Spiritual
Laws of Yogoda must be known and followed before God-contact is
possible. YOGODA QUICKENS MAN'S EVOLUTION
THROUGH AN INTELLIGENT CO-OPERATION WITH

insures lasting youth. . . ." It drives away headaches in
stantly. Harmonizes all muscle actions. Makes colds im
possible. Prevents constipation and all stomach troubles.
To promulgate the doctrine the Swami Yogananda is
how on the move to "recruit a Spiritual Army." This
Army will spread the tidings of Cosmic Life-Force to
every town and hamlet in this materialistic republic. He
announces that "Yogoda needs real workers, robust in
body and mind, of calm disposition, mental shock-ab
sorbers who will allow nothing to upset or anger them,
who will join Yogoda for life, or who can receive at
least one year's training to be teachers, according to the
rules of the institution." After the manner of the orthodox
Sunday Schools, Yogoda is out to train teachers, to in
doctrinate them properly, and when all is ready, we are
to be treated to such an attack of cosmic-consciousness
as we shall not in safety be able to withstand. For the
distinguishing thing about the Swami is that he knows
us as well as he knows his Oriental philosophy. During
one of his recent jaunts through the countryside, he spoke
to the Optimist Club of Minneapolis —after having been
welcomed to the state by the Governor and the Lieu
tenant-Governor, and to the city by the Mayor—on the
subject "How Oriental Methods Can Help Occidental
Business." To the two hundred Kiwanians at luncheon
assembled in the same thriving city he discoursed on the
still more irresistible subject, "Recharging Your Busi
ness Battery Out of the Cosmos." We modern Americans
will have none of religion if it does not offer us something
practical for the wear and tear of the life we live. Swami
Yogananda knows that; even the ancient mysteries of the
East are of no interest to us if they do not help us in our
business. Swami Yogananda knows that. Jesus unfor
tunately did not foresee it. It is a melancholy and irrev
erent thought that if He returned today He might
address us in our own terminology.

Magazine has it that each night for several weeks several
thousand persons heard him gladly. There is accompany
ing this report a picture in which a large and eager au
dience is shown, each member with his hands raised be
fore him in a gesture of supplication and each pair of lips
rounded for enunciating the sacred word "Oom."
Probably a great deal too much store has been set by
the fact that of late the Swami Yogananda was peremp
torily ordered to leave the town of Miami. The Swami
refused to obey the order and left later of his own ac
cord, as he explains. What the nature of the charges
against him were is not quite clear, either from the press
accounts or from the circular letter he has broadcast about
the incident. It seems to have derived from racial teach
ings which were not palatable to the chief of police ; and
credence is attached to this supposition by the fact that
the same chief who ordered him to leave was three weeks
later indicted for complicity in a chain of murders —
among them the murder of a Negro bellhop who, in the
line of duty, was alleged to have made the suggestion to
a daughter of the old South that she enter a gentleman's
room. Ere these lines find their way to type I have no
doubt that the Swami will be properly vindicated, for
none other than John F. Hylan, "for eight years Mayor
of New York," as his own phrase has
it,
has been en
gaged to defend him.
The public was of course eager for
a
scandal, but the
worst scandal rising from the Swami Yogananda
is
one
he has perpetrated upon himself. He
is
guilty of conces
sion to American methods and practices in the teaching
of the Oriental mysteries.

California are varied. There is a Candy Department
which sells Cactus Candy to the faithful, devoting the
proceeds to the extension of the work. There were beau
tiful hand-painted Christmas cards which were decked
with Yogoda symbols and eloquent with Yogoda sen
timents and mottoes: the proceeds from the sale of
these was turned to the paving of the boulevard above
which the castle of the Swami lifts its towers, its
forty rooms, and its halls capable of seating one thou
sand admirers. Like Epworth Leaguers, the following
of the Swami Yogananda may show their colours. Yo
goda emblems, goldplated, in orange and blue enamel,

goda Students everywhere! Proclaim to the world your
adherence to Yogoda principles by wearing one of these
beautiful little pins or lapel buttons." Photographs of the
Swami may be had for two dollars each and the Corre
spondence School does a thriving business among
thwarted club women and frustrated business men. An
nouncement is made through the columns of the East-
West that the headquarters will gladly welcome odd and
interesting gifts for the museum in Los Angeles, "also
household or other gifts." The columns of the magazine
are filled with stuff clipped from Liberty and everywhere
else, including what G. Bernard Shaw, Henry Ford,

of Unity and the work of Angelus Temple. They are of
a slightly different nature, however, for the followers
and potential followers of the Swami seem most anxious
to be delivered from fatigue and worry. Each issue of the
official organ, in true Occidental fashion, carries a series
of the testimonies offered by grateful beneficiaries. "I
have been greatly strengthened, vitalized and have gained
poise," writes one earnest woman who teaches in the pub
lic schools of Buffalo. And she adds: "From now on
fatigue will be merely a word in the dictionary for me."
Another writes with naive reference to Yogoda: "I have
had four years of every treatment known to medical
science and all isms besides. I have received my first help
through Yogoda." Still another restored a misplaced
kneecap through Yogoda after she had tried every other
means for sixteen years. An Ohio lady testifies that:
"Yogoda is the greatest educative force in the world to
day. I used to feel tired all the time, now I am never
fatigued. The lesson on recharging the body is worth the
price of the entire course." A physician of Cincinnati
glows with admiration because the science of Yogoda
enables the body to perform miracles of endurance: "To
know how to tap the source of energy and knowingly do
that which can be done momentarily under excitement,
is the key to the problems of life and health, physical,
mental, moral and spiritual." A baroness, now resident
in Minneapolis, writes: "My body has been energized,
my mind made peaceful. My outlook on life is clearer
and I have acquired an understanding of spiritual truths
and how to make them practical in my everyday life."
Again: "I have recovered almost entirely from nervous
ness : my eyesight is better and I am now able to have the
use of my right ear for the first time in three years." Min
neapolis enthusiasts are authors of the next two testi
monials : "I can say that Yogoda is all one needs in Truth.
The Swami's lesson on spiritualizing sex force should be
taught in every school in our country." "Every meeting
has been a spiritual feast, my soul has been filled and

which I have heretofore been using, were a revelation
to me and the results obtained therefrom, in the short
time practised, is (sic) beyond what could be hoped for."
These testimonials offering evidence of the soothing and
pacifying nature of the Yogoda could be multiplied here,
and they certainly will be multiplied in the magazine as
Yogoda continues its triumphant march through Amer
ica. The cure of nerves and frustration is not the only
feat—there are others, relating to every physical ill and
nasty habit. One man from Minneapolis writes: "At the
healing meeting, to my great joy and surprise, I was
cured of my tobacco habit completely and without any
effort on my part. I have always been a heavy user of
tobacco and cigars." 13
It is the high purpose of the Swami to make religion
scientific. He recognizes, with perfect soundness, that the
ultimate action of all our life is the attainment of Bliss.
"Religion," to him, "necessarily consists in the perma
nent removal of pain and the realization of Bliss of
God." 14
Pain derives from fleshly desire of one sort or
another and "desire is the root of all misery, which arises
out of the identification of our 'self with mind and
body." 15
What man wants is Blissful Conscious Exist
ence, and to achieve this he must abolish the sense of
want and transcend the passions of the body. When we
have attained what he calls Bliss, we have this transcen
dence and we become "the dispassionate seer of all our
actions." Our narrow egoism vanishes, the All-Ego
dawns, and Bliss spreads through our being. We feel that
we are playing our parts on the stage of the world, with
out being inwardly affected by the weal or woe, love and
hate, that playing the part involves.16 It is this thoroughly
and sublimely impersonal attitude toward the body and
the self which we must achieve. To do this there are vari
ous methods. There is Concentration and there is Medi
tation, but far and away the best method is that taught in

the Science of Yogoda as set forth by the Swami Yogan-
anda. Here Bliss is "felt in an intense degree" and more
over: "The practise of it is of itself intensely Blissful
—far more purely Blissful, I venture to say, then the
greatest enjoyment that any of our five senses or the mind
can ever afford us." 17
The process, roughly speaking,
lies in magnetizing the spinal column and using the elec
tricity that is stored in the body and lodged in the brain
as the chief power house. When first undertaken it
"brings a most attractive state of Body consciousness,"
but ultimately Bliss settles over the physique and the
pleasures of the flesh are forgotten. In its highest reaches
it brings us into direct contact with God and charges our
weary frames with the elixir of eternal energy.
That, in brief, is what the Swami teaches with such
gusto and success. Nature makes marvellous adjustments.
In the early days when we suffered from repression and
loneliness, she sent Mother Ann to us and uncapped great
revivals in the mountains of Kentucky. Men and women
rolled in the agony of repentance and wallowed in the
pleasure of the flesh before the very throne of God. We
needed release and we found it in our religion. Progress
brought change and decay to our nation. Wealth accu
mulated and men extroverted : we grew nervous and fussy
and thwarted. Then Nature sent us the Swamis and the
Yogis, and we find now the solace and narcosis that we
need above all else. And we find what we need, as we
found it before, in the channels of religion. Certainly it
all lends credence to the contention of some psychologists
that we make religion the channel of our deepest wishes
and that we form and shape it to our liking.

XV
SHAKERISM
THERE is only one way to tell the story of Shakerism,
and that is to begin with moral vicissitudes of Ann Lee.
Ann, like P. P. Quimby, was the child of an honest, hard
working blacksmith. She was born in Manchester, Eng
land, forced to work in the cotton factories of that city
at a very early age, and handicapped throughout her life
by the fact that she never learned to read or write. She
was a sensitive child, so the Shakers say, and was given
frequently, like Swedenborg, to seeing angelic visions
while she was yet a child. These she reported to her
mother and Mrs. Lee, like another mother, kept all these
things in her heart and pondered over them. Ann was
markedly serious and thoughtful, with grave, penetrat
ing eyes, and very soon after adolescence began she be
came depressed by the depravity of human nature and the
lustfulness of marriage. She begged her mother piteously
to be delivered from matrimony and its impurity, but in
vain. When the proper time arrived, she was married to
Abraham Stanley, a blacksmith and a man who "loved
his beef and beer and his seat in the village tavern."
But the question of purity was not settled for Ann Lee.
Qualms of conscience continued to torture her and she
longed and prayed for sexual purity. Ann was also "bur
dened for her husband, from whose physical embraces
she shrank with sensitive repugnance." She spent many
sleepless nights of prayer to God for deliverance from
her sin in matrimony. She reports that her travail and
sufferings were so great that "my flesh consumed upon my
bones, bloody sweat pressed through the pores of my

skin, and I became as helpless as an infant." One who
knew her well in those days testified that "she wasted
away like one in consumption and became so weak and
emaciated that her friends had to feed and care for her
as though she were an infant. At times her skin was
covered with bloody perspiration and her groans and
cries dismayed all." *
This intense suffering and repugnance for the sexual
embrace continued for nine years with very little relief.
She could neither read nor write, and there was little
chance for the great theologians of her day to help her.
She was sure of only two things, Anne Lee and sin. In
1758 she joned the society of the Shaking Quakers, a
sect carried on in England under the supervision of Jane
and James Wardley, which in turn owed its origin to
the Camisards or French Prophets. These Camisards
sprang into being at the time Louis XIV revoked the
Edict of Nantes and deprived Protestants of what little
religious freedom they had enjoyed. The sect was led by
James Cavalier, an inspired baker who gathered to his
standard more than five hundred outraged Protestants
and led them through the land proclaiming that the day
of the Lord was nigh. In worship these Camisards gave
way to paroxysms which resembled fits. They beat the
air with their arms, fell upon the ground, and writhed
in horrible contortions. When consciousness returned, for
they went into the blindest of trances, they were seized
with violent tremblings and twitchings, and then be
gan to prophesy and to call upon God for mercy. They
claimed the gift of tongues and of clairvoyance.
The result of these manifestations was that the gov
ernment persecuted the sect mercilessly. Many were put
to death in 1702 and in 1705 their three most prominent
prophets were burned at the stake and two others were
broken on the wheel. John Cavelier and a small group
escaped to England, where they went about the country
proclaiming with the same certainty of Judge Ruther
ford today that the end of the world was soon to come.

SHAKERISM 323
By 1705, there were almost four hundred of these French
Prophets stirring England.
It was from these Camisards that the Shaking Quak
ers of Jane and James Wardley took their cue. They were
given to practically the same kind of convulsion when
the spirit was upon them ; they would be seized with a
mighty trembling when the spirit descended and they
would express the wrath of God against all sin. They had,
however, two very important characteristics. One was the
belief that the Christ spirit would come again and that
the second time it would be embodied in a woman. The
other was their habit of requiring all who wished to join
them to confess their sins freely and minutely before they
were admitted. In this regard they were the Buchmanites
of their day.
Ann joined them in 1758, made a lurid confession of
her sins, and got some temporary relief, but not enough.
Her four children died in infancy, and this she took as a
divine visitation for having succumbed to the world and
the bonds of matrimony. Her suffering continued, albeit
she prophesied and took an active part in the work of the
Shaking Quakers —active enough at any rate to get her
self thrown into jail along with the rest. It was here that
the revelation came to her. It was revealed to her that
man's sin lay in the premature and self-indulgent use of
the sexual union. She saw in a vision, so White and
Taylor inform us, that
the first pair (Adam and Eve) performed . . . not for the divinely
erected purpose of procreation, but as an act of self-indulgence and
therefore sin.
This vision set her to thinking and she finished the
Revelation in jail in 1770. When released from her stone
cell, which was too small for reclining, she told the society
of Shaking Quakers what she had seen. The announce
ment was attended by such displays of the divine pres
ence and approval
. . . that they say, at once that the candle of the Lord was in her
hand and that she was able by the light thereof to search every heart

and try every soul amongst them. From that time she was received
and acknowledged as the first visible leader of the Church of God on
earth.2
This candle she used to great effect. All who knew her
commented upon her eyes; she had that Buchman power
of looking into the very depths of a man's soul and guess
ing just what his besetting sin was most likely to be.
Probably nine times out of ten she, too, was right.
It was not so much the power of her eyes that counted
now, however. She was the fulfillment of the Wardley
prophecy. Here was Christ again, and in a woman. By
the theology of the sect, Christ became the second Adam
and Ann the second Eve, thus restoring the race, both
male and female, to perfect purity. She was the one in
whom dwelt the Divine Mother. The Shakers believe,
as did the Rappites before them, that God is not triune,
but dual, that he is male and female, and that since Adam
was created in His image, Adam was both male and fe
male. It was therefore necessary that there be two sav
iours, one to restore man, another to redeem woman
from her sin. In Ann the redemption of mankind was
complete.
It is not surprising that her doctrines met with some
disfavour. Persecution abounded. On one occasion a mob
dragged her, kicking and beating her, for two miles, but
she was finally released by a nobleman, who testified that
he had, for some unearthly reason, been seized by the
urge to go in a certain direction. Always she seemed pro
tected from actual death. Once a mob tried to hang her,
but the excited members somehow couldn't tie the knots
securely. Again they tried to stone her, but fortunately
everyone missed her and she passed out of the midst of
them unhurt.
Her worst foes were those of her own household. A
brother become so enraged as she sat singing and
prophesying that he seized a stick the size of a broom
handle and beat her over the head and face until the stick
was splintered. Then he called for drink and began again

with a new stick. Mother Ann testified that she was
guarded by some unseen force and that she did not feel
any of the blows that fell upon her. At last a messenger
was sent to the King for a permit which would enable
the village to put her out of the way, but the messenger
died on the way, "in such a manner that his death was
looked upon as a judgment from God."
Not only were her doctrines odious: she made people
acutely conscious of their sin. The confession of sins was
continued; once confessed, the memory of them was
taken away. If they did not confess, Mother Ann aided
them. "Many quailed before her clear unfolding of their
hidden thoughts and deeds." "Others were so affected
that they could not speak their own language for several
days but uttered prophecies in divers tongues." White
and Taylor report that Ann herself was once brought
before four learned clergymen of the Church of England
and that there she spoke, though illiterate, in seventy-
two different languages, and in some of them more flu
ently and correctly than any of the clergymen had ever
heard man speak before.
At last the persecution subsided, but England was too
conservative and staid for the faith and Mother Ann
concluded that the best chances lay in evangelizing
America. With seven followers, including Abraham Stan
ley, her husband, four other men and two other women,
she set sail in 1774 for America. On the voyage Mother
Ann spoke boldly against the wickedness of the cap
tain and the sailors. The Shakers persisted in prac
tising their peculiar dance ceremonies on the deck of
the ship, with the result that the captain threatened to
throw the whole lot of them overboard. Nothing daunted,
the Shakers came out again the next morning and
again sang and danced on the deck. The captain started
to make good his threat, when suddenly the ship sprang
a leak and all hands were needed to man the ship and
keep her from floundering. The sailors were at their
wits' end, when Ann saw two angels on the mast of the
ship; from them she received a message that every
thing would be all right. This message she took to the

captain. No sooner said than done. A wave hit the ship
in such a manner that the loose plank was pressed securely
into place and the leak no longer troubled them.
They landed without the need of further miracle and
Ann, immediately after she arrived in New York, began
to take in washing and ironing. It was agreed among the
flock that they should, for the good of all, separate for
a time. Other members of the party went up the river
and took up a section of swampy land at Niskeyuna, the
modern Watervliet, near Albany. Here they laid the
foundation for the Shaker empire in the new land. But
the tribulations of Mother Ann had not ceased. Her hus
band had embraced the faith with her, but New York
was too much for him. He was taken ill and it required
all the time and energies of his wife to bring him back
to health. When he was well enough, he began to reward
her with curses and abuses. He got in with the wrong
crowd, as it were, and before many months passed he had
renounced the Shaker faith. He returned to the cold hut
where they lived and told Ann she would have to come
with him as a wife of the world or else he would leave
her. She refused, Abraham went out and took unto him
self another wife, and Ann was left in almost complete
deprivation. At times her supplies were so low that she
lived on nothing but vinegar.
At least a certain livelihood seemed possible in the
wilderness, and Ann joined her followers in the settle
ment near Albany. Extensive preparations were made for
the influx of converts which she so steadfastly prophe
sied. One year an immense log house was built to care for
the new members who were sure to come. A great harvest
was reaped from the fields, and all was in readiness. Then
the log house burned down and no converts came. Dis
couragement at last prevailed and some doubt was ex
pressed among the brethren as to whether Ann was really
the Mother of God.
It was not until after five years that the prophecy was
fulfilled. Then there occurred at Mount Lebanon, New
York, one of those gigantic awakenings of the spirit that
mark the years of America's religious history. Among the

converts there was "violent shaking of the frame some
times followed by outbursts of inspired song, visions and
revelations." It was such an outpouring of the Holy
Ghost as America had not seen. The result was that the
converts, zealous and determined as they were, did not
receive from their elders just that kind of instruction
which they felt was needed. They wandered off into the
woods, and there ran onto the strange little group of
Shaking Quakers. Ann Lee's stern preaching and abso
lute suppression of anything that smacked of lust set
well upon the stomachs of these newly earnest converts,
with the result that enough joined the Shakers to make
possible a Family of a hundred. They now called them
selves the "United Society of Believers in Christ's Second
Appearing."
By this revival the movement took firm root. Mother
Ann became the crowning spirit of it all, and she
launched out at once upon far-flung missionary enter
prises. The whole affair was marked by that peculiar
ecstasy and suffering which attends revivals among neu
rotic pioneers. "From morning until far into the night
they were preaching, exercising in march and dance,
Shaken with the love of God, instructing young converts,
agonizing in spirit, wrestling for souls that came to
them."3 From May 1781 to August 1783, Mother Ann
and her elders visited thirty-six towns in Massachusetts
and Connecticut, subjected always to persecution of the
most childish and boisterous sort. They could hardly
visit a village without being set upon by a howling pack
of potential Americans, who subjected the Shakers to
every brand of indignity that a sturdy forefather of Em
peror Simmons could think of. At times, however, the
same protecting force that had guarded Mother Ann
hovered over them. Traditions of such divine partner
ship have multiplied. It is well known, say the Shakers,
that the tree to which a certain Father Jones was tied
during one of these persecutions soon afterward died.
The annihilation of sex continued the distinctive fea
ture of the sect. To married couples who came seeking

forsake the marriage of the flesh or you cannot be mar
ried to the Lamb." If the couple wished to join they had
to give up the conjugal relation and live as brother and
sister, the one dwelling among the men of the Family,
the other among the women.
Mother Ann died in 1784 and the rule of the United
Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing de
volved upon Joseph Meacham, a Baptist preacher who
had been converted by the founders, and Lucy Wright, a
woman of some talent and charm who had joined the sect
with her husband. Twelve years later Meacham died and
the rule for the next twenty-five years fell into the hands
of a woman—Lucy Wright.

The spread of Shakerism to the West almost coin
cided with the famous Kentucky revival which took place
at the beginning of the Nineteenth Century. Reports
came from the Kentucky region that a generous outpour
ing of the spirit was in progress there. Men were thrown
down by the Spirit as they walked along the streets, others
would simulate mad dogs, all felt painful contortions of
the body. Here, it seemed, was uncrowned Shakerism.
When the Brethren at Mount Lebanon heard of the mani
festations, they dispatched emissaries at once, instruct
ing them "to open the text of salvation to the people,
provided they were in a situation to receive it." Three
men left Mount Lebanon in January, 1800, and started
out across the wilderness for Kentucky. In March they
arrived at the home of Malcolm Worley, near Turtle
Creek, Ohio, where they were hospitably received. They
stated their position, to the great interest of Malcolm
Worley, and he, anxious to test the faith carefully, called
in his pastor, the Reverend Richard McNemar of the
New Light Church at Turtle Creek. Conversant with
Hebrew and Greek Scriptures, Reverend McNemar was
no mean antagonist in debate. The colloquy lasted far
into the night, with Worley, his wife, and nine children

listening intently while all sat about the huge log fire. At
last conviction came upon Worley and he consented to
become the centre of a Shaker community in Ohio.
Within a few weeks a dozen families, including that of
the Reverend McNemar, had joined the community, and
by the time the missionaries were through, they had es
tablished five communities, two in Ohio, two in Ken
tucky, and one in Indiana. In Ohio two others were later
established and the one in Indiana moved there.
These were the aggressive years of the Shakers. They
reached their apex of development in 1
836-1 840, and
though there were periods of intake ever and anon, they
never achieved more than in those early days. Since then
their story has been almost as tragical and dwindling as
that of the American Indian. It is true that the sect fed
upon the Millerite movement which stirred the country
in 1843 ; in fact, two hundred members of this sect, weary
of waiting for the end of the world, joined the Shakers
of Ohio. William Miller was a Massachussetts farmer
and a soldier in the war of 181 2. He was a man of limited
education, but by clever and ingenious prophecy based
upon a literal interpretation of the Scriptures, he con
vinced his followers that the end would come in 1843.
As is well known, the members of the sect sold their
property, made every conceivable arrangement—even to
the purchase of ascension robes—and went out to meet
their Lord. He never came, and before long the follow
ers grew dissatisfied and, curiously, lost confidence in
their leader. They were, therefore, both psychologically
and economically ready to embrace the Shaker faith.
Psychologically because Mother Ann stood for a Second
Appearing and economically because they had sold all
they had.4
During the forties the Shaker communities were
shaken as if by a mighty wind. Spiritualism began among
them, going to such lengths and becoming so accurately
recorded that the Shaker Church "may be said to be
the parent of modern spiritualism." The phenomena first

attacked the children's orders. The youngsters talked fre
quently with saints and with Mother Ann, often falling
into trances and waving their arms as if flying about
through the air with flocks of angels. At once the atten
tion of the elders was attracted. The experiences of the
children seemed to bring no serious bodily results, and
on the whole, they seemed real and quite the thing for
the members of a Shaker community. The children, I
might add, were acquired in two ways. They were
adopted as orphans, or, as the persecutors in Ohio alleged,
pressed into the order against their will, or they were
born before their parents became members of the com
munity.
It was not long before this sweeping experience spread
to the adult members of the order. In 1842 there came,
first, to Mount Lebanon then to all the other societies, a
strange "epoch of visitations by representatives of all
nationalities." Indians, Japs, Arabs, Ancient Jews, Chal
deans, Persians, and Hindus are reported by White and
Taylor to have thronged to Mount Zion.
Sometimes they came to the Elders, begging for an opportunity to
confess their sins, and pleading to be admitted to the ranks of the Be
lievers.
For months and years these visitations continued and it
is said that certain spirits became well known and much
loved by those whom they visited.
The Indians came often in tribes, headed by their chief or sometimes
led by a squaw. The family were called together, and then, through
sensitives or media, the native Indian would be revealed in all the
savage glory of warwhoop, song, and dance. . . . Sometimes they
would sing a song never heard before and the whole band of affected
media would sing as one person the new, strange melody, perhaps in
English, perhaps in Indian, perhaps a mixture of both.5
The purpose in coming, however, seems to have been
chiefly that of receiving instruction. According to tradi
tion and reports, they came in work hours, went into the
shops, there learned the trades of the white man, and were
instructed in the various trades followed by the brethren

and sisters. Thus the principles of industrial education
were applied to the Indians under the direction of
Mother Ann and "ante-dated half a century modern im
proved methods of educating savages."
After about ten years the visitations ceased, but not
without ceremony. The spirit visitors announced formally
that they were about to take leave of their earthly friends.
There was much sorrow over this leave-taking. Now it so
happens that an exercise which these spirits began was
that of kneeling and rapping on the floor when they
sought to be admitted or to attract the attention of earth
people. So it was that, when in 1848,
... in the city of Rochester, New York, the famous rappings began
at the home of the Fox sisters, the Shakers recognized the familiar
sounds and knew that their visitors for ten years past had, according
to their promise, gone out to visit "every city and hamlet, every palace
and cottage in the land." 8
There is a wealth of Shaker tradition and anecdote
which would itself fill a large volume.7 There is no
space here for reference to these stories and traditions,
though the one affecting the distinguished Lafayette is
much too good to be omitted.
The stately young French officer once attended a meet
ing of the Shakers at Mount Lebanon. Always a shrewd
observer, he became engrossed in the peculiar manifesta
tions of a certain Abijah Worcester. The young man had
the spirit upon him and as he sat under the spell of it he
twitched in a manner which, even to the Shakers of his
day, seemed quite remarkable. First engrossed, Lafayette
became transfixed as the manifestation continued. He
leaned toward the patient, studying his every move and
paroxysm intently. Abijah, however, suspected that he
was being used as a specimen and grew uncomfortable un
der the stare of the soldier. Turning to Lafayette he said,
"Would you desire this gift of spirits?" Lafayette, too
fascinated for a lengthy reply, said, "It is desirable."
And Abijah continued to twitch. At last, however, he

could stand the minute inspection no longer. Getting up,
he dashed from the room, but Lafayette was at his heels.
Abijah ran to the barn, with Lafayette behind him. To
disguise himself the subject picked up a broom and
started sweeping the floor diligently. But Lafayette was
with him. Unable to stand it longer, Abijah ran into the
cellar, but his pursuer was relentless. At last he dashed
into the loft of the meeting house, with the soldier of
fortune hard behind him. There it was that Lafayette
encountered Mother Ann and the elders in secret con
ference. From them Lafayette inquired the meaning of
the strange performance which had so captured his im
agination and attention. He was told that Abijah's
twitching was a part of the religious ceremony of the
Shakers. Upon hearing this, Lafayette is said to have
asked if he might not be admitted to the community.
Mother Ann told him that his function was on the earth
plane and that he was most needed at the courts of man.
Lafayette went away sorrowing, and though he never
became a Shaker, tradition has it that the Shakers in
America got message from the spiritual world of his
death fifteen days before the news arrived by boat from
Europe. He appeared to one of the sensitives in a vision,
reported his death, and said that he had seen Mother Ann
in the glory world.8
It is not surprising that any group so peculiar should
have been almost mercilessly persecuted, especially by
Americans. Anything at variance with our own beliefs
has always struck us as markedly sinful and preposterous.
No man can so gravely endanger his life in the land of
the free as he can by letting noise of an idiosyncrasy get
abroad among his neighbours. The persecution of the
Shakers is equalled, I think, by nothing else in our his
tory unless it be the drive against the Reds and Pinks dur
ing the late war. The account of it is long and gory, and
one who is avid for the gruesome details may find them
in any book on the Shakers. Suffice it to say that in 1810
a mob of five hundred, led by a Presbyterian minister
and accompanied by fifteen hundred spectators, attacked

the Shakers of Union Village. It was charged that the
community had stolen children, that they retained women
among their members by force, and that they had carnal
knowledge of their own women.9 Nothing serious came
of this mob's philandering, but the fact of it is sufficient.
The leader warned them in good Presbyterian manner
to give up their lewd dancing on the Sabbath. This they
refused to do, saying that if they had committed any
offense, they were responsible to the constituted authori
ties. From that time on, not to mention the indignities
which the Shakers were subjected to in the East, there
was a series of mobs in Ohio, all of them prompted by
the spirit of meddling and all governed by the holy im
pulse to guide the life of one's brother man. One trembles
to think what might have happened had the Shakers still
been obstreperous during the last reign of terror instituted
by the Ku Klux Klan.10
The mobs, I say, were moved by a holy animus. For
what are the Shakers but sinners and heretics when re
garded from the sound American point of view? They
practise communism; they deny the deity of Jesus by
asserting the equal deity of Mother Ann; they dress dif
ferently from their fellows and allow different customs
to prevail. Thus they commit sin against the holy trinity
of economic orthodoxy, theological respectability, and
American manners. And their downfall, so I have heard
from ministers, is to be traced to their godless practise
of communism.
Their downfall was of course due to several causes.
Their theology is a stench in the nostrils of the orthodox,
though critics among the standard Christians have al
ways been bewildered by the fact of their godly and un-
comprising lives. At best they" have been viewed with
self-conscious tolerance by the other Christian sects.
And they had little chance of evangelizing the world with
a theology so completely at variance with the accepted
one. Further, their rigid practice of asceticism has of

course prevented their numerical increase. Nay, it has
been a foremost cause of their decrease. Desertions for
the world have been frequent and they multiplied as the
nation made sin more and more attractive. The men and
women of the community have been scrupulously sepa
rated ; the keenest possible vigilance has been exercised
over them ; women dressed in such a manner as to conceal
their charms and to hide any hint of their femininity, as
is well for a mixed ascetic community. Whatever the hint
of scandal, and it has even touched the name of Mother
Ann, it is fairly certain that celibacy of a virginal and
unflagging sort has prevailed among the Shakers. They
have continued to believe with Mother Ann that the chief
sin, the cause of the world's woe, the cause of woman's
debasement, is sexual intercourse. This idea was ex
pressed in verse in 1803 :
Against the flesh we all unite,
And bear our cross by day and night,
For virgin purity we hold
More precious than Peruvian gold.
And with this people none can stay,
Unless they walk this narrow way.
I should not be surprised if the ostracism to which the
Shakers have been subjected has had much to do with
their failure. They must feel, as the psychologist would
say, inferior. They have acquired the same pathetic para
noia which in this day and time marks the Russellites. A
very old and fascinating Shaker document is not without
interest in this connexion. It is entitled The Lives and
Sufferings of Our Holy Saviour and Our Blessed Mother
Ann. It came by inspiration through William Leanord
in 1841. William was of the church at Harvard, Massa
chusetts, and he signs his message modestly with the word
"Instrument." The first part is given over to an auto
biography of Jesus in the vernacular and the second to
the same thing from Mother Ann. Jesus seems to have
told Mother Ann that the world would regret it if they
did not hear of her sufferings. She proceeds then, through
"Instrument," to record those sufferings, which are

largely the sufferings of the Shakers at the time the Mes
sage was received. Ann records that in childhood she had
many visions and that among them was one exceedingly
gloomy prison :
Through its gates I was never permitted to pass, nor even to glance
one single look; but on the outside of these gates there was printed in
large black letters:
"Within these gates and inclosed in these walls and gloomy cells
of torment dwell the persecutors, who have scourged, afflicted, and
tormented and put to death God's people through all the ages of the
world."
These persecutors were watched over by a group of
nasty angels whose business it was to torment continu
ously the unhappy and wretched souls of the tormentors
of God's people on earth. They were permitted to gaze
on "no spirit from heaven or earth that possessed one
ray of happiness, or that could extend to them one gleam
of hope."
It is easy for a psychiatrist, or any collegian who reads
the current stuff, to explain this vision from the spirit
world recorded through "Instrument." And yet the path
ology of it is not all nor is it over when it is explained.
The state of mind induced by persecution is not healthy,
nor does it conduce to longevity. We have come to accept
without question the sophistry that movements flourish
when persecuted and we fail to see that they are some
times annihilated. Persecution can kill and I am not so
sure but that the Shakers have been stifled as much by the
attitude of their fellow men as by the conspiracy of the
modern machine world against them.
As time went on the haunts of the Shakers became less
remote from the centres of Gentile civilization and, in
consequence, Shaker practices and ceremonies became
more and more a spectacle to the populace. The intelli
gentsia of the rural sections amused themselves by gazing
on the Shakers in their queer dances and odd whirling
movements. These dances were symbolic, and the sym
bolism was never quite appreciated by the witnesses. Dur

gesture of receiving divine blessings through the hands.
The shaking of the hands turned down symbolized the
shaking of sin and evil magnetism out of the body through
the finger tips. The men and women ranged themselves
at different ends of the room to begin the dance, then
approached each other in the manner of a stunt between
halves at a football game. It all must have been very
amusing to Philistines.
A superb description of the gift of prophecy often
induced by the sacred whirling dance is given in the ad
mirable collection of Sears:
At the close of the singing, one of the sisters began to rock to and
fro; at first gently, then in a more violent manner, until two of
the sisters, one on each side, supported her else she would have fallen
to the floor. She appeared to be wholly unconscious of her surroundings,
and to be moved by an invisible power. The shaking of the subject con
tinued to increase in violence, and it was with great difficulty that she
was restrained from throwing herself forcibly to the floor. Her limbs
became rigid, her face took on an ashen hue, her lips moved, and she
began to speak in a clear, distinct voice, every word of which pene
trated every part of the room, which was as still as death. Every
eye was on the recipient of the gift, every ear open to catch each word
as it fell from her lips. She spoke of the shortness of life, of the absolute
necessity of abandoning the world and its sinful pleasures before it was
too late; that in Shakerism were embodied all the virtues and none of
the vices of mankind; that through her the spirit of Mother Ann was
speaking to every Shaker present to remain steadfast to the

By now the Shakers, with venerable exceptions at Har
vard, Massachusetts and other New England points, have
perished from the earth. The historic community in Ohio
has become an orphanage and old people's home under
the control of the United Brethren Church, which bought
the remaining land and buildings for three hundred and
twenty-five thousand dollars in 191 2. The latter part of
the Nineteenth Century had been disastrous. In 1857 a

failed lamentably. In 1867 the number at Union Village,
Ohio had dwindled to a hundred and fifty-seven. In 1875
the world had made sharp inroads even upon the cus
toms of the godly, for a number of tottering apostates de
cided they wanted to wear beards, whereas the hoary cus
tom had been to shave once a week. In the eighties the
dance was given up, because the members of the com
munity were too few and too old to perform it properly.
The period from 1880 to 1891 was attended by fire, cy
clone, and disaster. Investments failed —such investments
as that placed in an apartment hotel in Minneapolis —
and the financial affairs of the body were sadly mis
managed. In 1908 -only eight old Shakers were left at
Union Village. Then four years later the United Breth
ren bought the properties of the meek for a song and
transformed it all into a colony for orphans and aged
widows and bachelors.12
Reasons for the decadence and final passing of the
Shakers—apart from those I have listed—seem to me
obvious. Again the case of the Indians is analagous, not
only in pathos but in fact. The Shaker community was
communistic, and, as the godly say, it could not thrive.
But more important still, the whole communistic arrange
ment was founded upon an agricultural economy and a
spirit of guild craftsmanship. The community, in its
palmy days, was entirely self-supporting. Its members
even raised the fruit from which its beverages were made.
Nay, more, they even wove the cloth from which the long,
light blue coats of the men and the severe garments of
the women were made. What is still more important, they
produced goods for sale in the outside world. The most
interesting document I have seen in Shaker annals is a
catalogue announcing Shaker chairs. This catalogue was
sent out as a tract, greeting the people, wishing them well,
calling them to repentance, and then giving the pictures
of the chairs which the community at Mount Lebanon
had made. And everyone admits, even those who regard
Mother Ann's assumption of deity as, let us say, over

stated, that the products of the community were invari
ably sound.
But with the impact of the machine on our agricultural
land, the Shakers came into sharp competition with
cheaper articles made by lathes and turned out as abun
dantly as Fords. Their products thus became, not chairs,
but curiosities. The net result of it all was that they were
crowded to the wall in precisely the same manner as were
the hand workers of the guilds at the beginning of the
Industrial Revolution. They were not fierce enough to go
about as did the hoodlums of the Ludlow riots and smash
the enemies which threatened them. They clung rather
to their divine way of living, hoping all the while that the
good Lord would make some provision for them whereby
they could conquer the world. They assigned their pass
ing, if one may judge from the sad essays written in the
last days, to the triumph of godlessness in this prosperous
land of ours. The orthodox, in turn, assigned it to the
triumph of godliness and the righteous defeat of com
munism. It seems to me that both the Shakers and their
accusers are mistaken. They faded under the stern en
croachment of the machine, an encroachment which nei
ther their theology, nor the theology of their enemies,
could possibly have avoided.
And thereby hangs an explanation which touches all
religion today. The scheme of the great faiths is agri
cultural. They set themselves in the midst of Western
civilization and wonder what is the matter. Only two
things are possible. Either the faith passes, or it adjusts
itself in some form of socialism to the conditions of the
time. And, if it passes, which is the more probable, it con
soles itself with the thought that its dogged righteousness
has been responsible for its downfall.
It was, then, a simple, relentless change of world econ
omy that brought the Shakers to their end. Their doc
trines may be mildly amusing now, but the character and
tenderness of these people is touching. Always the vic
tims of ingrates who took advantage of their hospitality,
they stand forth as the kindest and most humanitarian
of the sects. Carroll Stewart tells how on cold winter

SWEDENBORGIANISM
No sect of modern times has so great an eponym as the
Church of the New Jerusalem. Emanuel Swedenborg,
prior to his Divine Illumination and intercourse with an
gels at the age of fifty-seven, was a man of talent, charm,
and learning. He was a member of the Swedish House
of Lords, Extraordinary Assessor of the Royal Board of
Mines, a friend and confidant of the illustrious Polheim,
and himself a scientist and inventor of demonstrated
parts. In Principia, published in 1734, he propounded
the nebular hypothesis—twenty years in advance of
Kant's Natural History of the Heavens and sixty years
before La Place laboured the theory in his Systeme du
Monde. He tinkered with a contrivance which he de
scribed as "a certain ship which with its men was to go
under the surface of the sea and do great damage to the
fleet of the enemy," worked on a machine gun which
would discharge seventy bullets a minute without re
loading, and sketched the plan of a machine by which
"men could raise themselves and move about in the air."
He also invented an incipient steam engine, designed
a successful ear-trumpet and contrived a new stove. In
1910 an application for patent on a stove was denied by
the United States Government on the ground that Swe
denborg has described the design two hundred years be
fore. And this is the man who in his declining years
founded the Church of the New Jerusalem.
He was born in 1688, the second son of Jesper Swed-
berg, Lutheran Bishop of Akara and previously pro
fessor in the University of Upsala. The family was

£hnobled by the Queen in 1719, ten years after Emanuel
completed his studies at the University of Upsala and the
family name changed to Swedenborg. He was a child of
pious parents, and in later years wrote to a friend :
From my fourth to my tenth year I was constantly engaged in
thought upon God, salvation and the spiritual experience of men ; and
several times I revealed things at which my father and mother won
dered, saying that angels must be speaking through me.
And while it was well known that Martin Luther, in
his monkish days, had seen spirits and heard their voices,
Emanuel's mother informed his father that he "must
stop these celestial excursions," and Emanuel heard not
another tinkle from the glory world until he was fifty-
seven.
During his college days he wrote vagrant verse in
Latin and dedicated most of it to his father. His love for
music was enormous, and he often took the organ in the
absence of his father's organist. Helen Keller, his most
enthusiastic modern disciple, tells us that "he was never
known to unbend to the gayeties and sports of youth" and
that "he could not even in later life make love to the shy
young girl who inspired the only passion he ever knew."
He went instead to her father, the distinguished Pol-
heim, and "would have proved his love by means of
charts and diagrams. The father was willing and gave
the young man a warrant for the girl returnable in three
years, but the girl was so frightened that her brother
finally persuaded Swedenborg to give her up."
1
He received his doctorate from Upsala at the age of
twenty-one. His father wished him to enter the diplo
matic service, but the young man had a hankering for
science and decided to travel abroad. He had introduc
tions to the sovereigns of Europe, which he never used,
but went instead to call on Halley of comet fame. Two
years he spent in England, "studying Newton daily and
anxious to see and hear him"; afterwards he travelled
in Germany, Holland, and France, working all the time
on his pet inventions—and visiting libraries, museums,

picture galleries, churches, monasteries, asylums, theatres.
Then upon his return to Sweden in 1716 Charles XII
appointed him assayer of mines, and he spent the next
thirty years of his life studying the sciences. He wrote
every minute he could find, producing some sixty books
and pamphlets before his soul was opened to heavenly
things. Chief among his scientific volumes are The First
Principles of Natural Things, The Brain, The Economy
of the Animal Kingdom, and Rational Psychology. His
portrait hangs beside that of Linnseus in the hall of the
Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm.
It was while in labour with Rational Psychology that
he drifted rapidly toward the weird experience that
changed every emphasis of his amazing life. He said, "I
intend to examine, physically and philosophically, the
whole anatomy of the body." He then catalogued the or
gans and substances which he purposed to inspect min
utely.
I propose afterwards to give an Introduction to Rational Psychol
ogy, consisting of certain new doctrines [which he enumerated] through
the assistance of which we may be conducted from the material organ
ism of the body to a knowledge of the soul, which is immaterial.
In a measure he was on a quest to find the soul in the
human anatomy, and he was hot on the trail of this elu
sive entity when his Illumination came. "It came gradu
ally, a still small voice, at first from behind." But it came,
and in 1744 "he was fully admitted to intercourse with
angels and spirits by a process of speaking to them while
thoroughly conscious." In his own mind there was no un
certainty. He said, "I have seen, heard, felt." He said
of himself that through him
... the Lord Jesus Christ, the only wise God, our Saviour, [would
come] and found the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, by
means of a man who can not only receive the doctrines of this Church
with his understanding but can make them public by the press. That
the Lord manifested Himself before me, His Servant, and sent me on
this duty, and afterwards opened the sight of my spirit, thus intro
ducing me into the spiritual world, permitting me to see the heavens

and the hells, and also to coverse with angels and spirits, and this
now continually for many years, I testify now in truth.
His contemporary, Robsahm, records a conversation
in which he asked Svvedenborg "where and how it was
granted him to see and to hear what takes place in the
world of spirits, in heaven, and in hell." The answer was
that in the night one had come to him and said
. . . that He was the Lord God, the Creator of the world, and the
Redeemer, and that he had chosen me to explain to men the spiritual
sense of the Scripture, and that He Himself would explain to me what
I should write on this subject; that same night were opened to me,
so that I became thoroughly convinced of their reality, the world of
spirits, heaven and hell, and I recognized there many acquaintances
of every condition in life. From that day I gave up the study of all
worldly science, and laboured in spiritual things, according as the Lord
had commanded me to write. Afterward the Lord opened, daily very
often, my eyes, so that in the middle of the day I could see into the
other world, and in state of perfect wakefulness, converse with angels
and spirits.2
In 1766 he wrote to C. F. Oetinger:
1 can solemnly bear witness that the Lord Himself has appeared to
me, and that he has sent me to do what I am doing now, and that for
this purpose he has opened the interiors of my mind, which are those of
my spirit, so that I can see those things which are in the spiritual
world and hear those who are there, and which privileges I have
now had for twenty-two years.
In confirmation of his heavenly fellowship, he was
good enough to keep a diary of his daily contacts with
the denizens of the World of Spirits. This has been trans
lated by George Bush and others. For the edification of
the reader I quote at random from the entries in Bush's
translation, selecting, I confess, those which lend verisi
militude to the seer's claims.3 As for example:
It has been observed here and there that spirits have produced on my
body effects entirely perceptible to sense, just as external objects do:
for instance, they have scattered disagreeable and sweet odours often
enough . . . they have maltreated my body so as to cause very grievous

pain, and this on several occasions; they have most manifestly induced
cold and heat and cold more frequently. . . . Wherefore it should
not be doubted that they are organic substances, and not merely
thought.
Frequently he records, "It was this day granted me to
speak with angels," and in many cases he finds the angels
in happy agreement with him on ideas he had long en
tertained. He discovered that, as he had often thought,
"the sciences contribute nothing to salvation, but rather
confuse and distort ideas." Again:
I spoke with spirits concerning drunkenness, and it was confirmed
by them that it was an enormous sin, as well as that man becomes a
brute, no longer a man ; because that man is a man lies in his in
tellectual faculty; thus he becomes a brute, besides which he brings
damage on his body and so hastens his death, besides wasting in ex
travagance what might be of use to many.
As for sexual perverts, he finds among the angels a
holy disgust, greater, if possible, than that which he him
self often expressed. In one of his conversations he found
that
Sodomites in the other life are punished with infernal torments,
which are so dire that they can scarcely be described ; and moreover
constitute the region of the tail, where are the faces: because they are
dung and dwell in privies.
This is strong language for angels, yet often the ex
traordinary took place in these conversations:
Today it was granted me to experience some states which are entirely
unknown to men, and, indeed, many of them ineffable, and if it should
be endeavoured to form any idea thereof by words, yet they would be
wholly unintelligible, therefore incredible.
So frequent and intimate was his relationship that he
knows well the habits and schedules of the heavenly host:
Spirits also sleep. This night there have been many spirits around
me; in the morning I spoke concerning some one, or several of them,
and I have heard that they were asleep, and indeed in a sweet sleep.
It was not always that the experience was pleasant. On
one occasion he records:

In sleep I was harrassed by those who employed sorceries or trull-
dom, but I do not remember in what manner I was harassed. Having
awakened in the night, I perceived that such spirits were around me,
yea also in the skin of my head ; for when I awaked, many fled away,
and, indeed, as if from the skin of my head, here and there with a
slight hissing sound, like when some little distended visicle is perfo
rated.
Swedenborg was obviously convinced of the special dis
pensation on his behalf, and he at once cast aside the
paraphernalia of science as though it had been one of
the demimonde tempting him to sinful pleasures. He
resigned his assessorship, the better to assay the elements
and ores of the World of Spirits, and from his study re
moved all books and scientific instruments in which he
had previously delighted. On his table he placed copies
of the Old and New Testament Scriptures in Hebrew and
Greek and for twenty-eight years tinkered with infinity.
When we remember the distinction which Swedenborg
enjoyed, the booty of his forays into the scientific field,
the conversion of Paul on the Damascus Road seems a
mere New Year's resolution. The transformation could
not be more complete if William Hale Thompson should
devote his declining years to a study of English literature.
The effect of the change upon his contemporaries can
well be imagined. While the science of his day was not so
antipodal to theology as the science of our day, Sweden-
borg's change of life none the less brought no end of
ridicule and criticism in the circles of scholarship.
Among the saints, it was of course different. Here was a
man of parts to vindicate their cause, and a moderately
large number of Christians have accepted his revelations
since the day of his death. Before that day he composed
in Latin twenty-nine stupendous volumes, covering the
whole range of Christian eschatology and doctrine, and
laying so firm a basis for the faith he delivered that few
if any have been able to shake it. The churches of the
New Jerusalem have not been hampered greatly by here
sies. It has probably been as true as any institution to its
founder, and for the simple reason that he was so ad
mired, colossal, and impressive that none has dared to

change his emphasis. Indeed the lengths to which his
devotees will go may be seen from the following claim
of William McGeorge, a Philadelphia lawyer, who felt
that perhaps the New Church might be slipping just a
bit from her moorings:
I am quite unable to believe that it was due either to ignorance
or carelessness that he capitalized so many common words. Conse
quently I am constrained to believe that he had an intelligent purpose
in so doing, and that his so doing is an integral part of revelation.*
Among his followers, belief in the genuineness of his
Revelation and Illumination persists and grows apace.
He is regarded today as a divine seer who received spe
cial and particular information from the Lord God in
the Eighteenth Century, a holy prophet who interpreted
the Word with such wisdom and consummate insight that
his interpretations are to be accepted in preference to
the original Word itself. The Reverend John Goddard
says in familiar language, "He came not to destroy the
law or the prophets, but to fulfil them." The Reverend
Goddard also assures us that for twenty-eight years
Swedenborg "passed as freely from one world to an
other as we go in and out of our houses." 3
He argues for
the validity of the seer's supernatural experience by refer
ence to the instances in the New Testament where angels
appeared to men, notably to the shepherds, to Joseph and
Zacharias and Mary; moreover, "all the scenes in the
closing book of the Bible are laid in the spiritual world."
But we are "not to trust him because he proved his power
to communicate with the dead," but rather because his
unveilings were orderly and for a good purpose. This
fact distinguishes them from the arrogant claims of me
diums and the fakirs of modern Spiritualism.
Helen Keller compares Swedenborg to Saint John the
Divine: "What he saw in symbol, Swedenborg saw in
reality. He bore witness to the fulfillment of those
prophetic pictures, and explained every scene, so that the

Apocalypse is no longer a sealed book; it lies open, its
seals broken and its message shining with the splendour,
of the Lord's second coming." 6
The Reverend George
Bush, one time professor of Hebrew at New York Uni
versity, has written a book in which he sets forth the
opinion he once held of the Swedish seer:
With the mass of the Christian world, I contended myself with the
vague impression of his having been a man of respectable talents and
attainments, but who had unhappily fallen into a kind of monomania,
which made him the victim of strange delusions and dreams —the
honest but real dupe of the wildest phantasies in respect to the state of
man after death, and the constituent nature of Heaven and Hell.T
He became attracted to Swedenborg, however, by the
similarity of their beliefs in the resurrection— that it takes
place immediately after death —and became an earnest
votary of the seer until the day of his death. Like the ma
jority of those who accept the claims and disclosures of
Swedenborg, he exalted the man's spiritual achievements
far above any paltry feats he may have performed in the
realm of profane science.
It is this exaltation of the seer's religiosity which is by
long odds the chief characteristic of those who follow his
dictatorship in paths of righteousness. Speaking before
the International Swedenborgian Congress, a body as
sembled in 1910 to do belated honour to the many aspects
of the man's character, Dr. Edward John Broadfield,
president of the assembly, stated what virtually every
speaker took pains to reiterate:
Swedenborg advanced from stage to stage, but every stage was pre
paratory to its successor; and those of us who consider his Illumination,
as the starting point of his greatest period, recognize in all his pre
vious experience an all-embracing period of preparation.8

348 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
portant among his followers than the writings of, say,
Wesley among the Methodists, I must set down a clear-
cut statement of the New Church doctrine as recited
by Bishop Pendleton of the General Church of the New
Jerusalem. This branch of the Church, as we shall pres
ently see, is the more conservative of the two, for it
branched off from what is now known as the Convention
of the New Church in 1897, when certain followers
became convinced that the proper acknowledgment was
not being given to the writings of the seer. While it may
be that the Convention has modified its views and come
to regard the Swedish scientist as only a superb com
mentator, Bishop Pendleton leaves us in no doubt as to
the meaning which he and his followers attach to the
Swedenborgian revelation :
1. The Lord has made His Second Coming in the Writings of the
New Church, revealing Himself therein, in His own Divine Human,
as the only God of Heaven and earth. In those Writings, therefore,
is contained the very essential Word, which is the Lord. From them the
Lord speaks to His Church, and the Church acknowledges no other
Authority, and no other law.
2. The old or former Christian Church is consummated and dead,
with no hope of a resurrection ; nor can there be a genuine Church
except with those who separate themselves from it and come to the
Lord in His New Church. The New Church is to be distinct from
the Old, in faith and practice, in form and organization, in religion
and social life.
3. The Priesthood is the appointed means for the establishment of
the Church ; it is not to be placed under external bond in the exercise
of its function in the Church.
4. Baptism is the door of introduction into the New Church on
earth, and establishes consociation with those in the other world who
are in the faith of the Church.
5. The Holy Supper is the most holy act of the worship of the
Church ; and the wine of the Holy Supper is the pure, fermented juice
of the grape.
6. The marriage of conjugal love is between those who are of one
mind, in the true faith and the true religion. A marriage of one in
the faith of the Church, with one in a false faith, or in no faith,
is heinous in the sight of heaven.
7. Any interference on the part of man with the law of offspring in
marriage, is an abomination.

8. The laws, in the latter part of the work on Conjugal Love,
extending from n. 444 to 476 inclusive, are laws of order, given for the
preservation of the conjugal.
9. The Doctrine of the New Church is revealed from God out
of the inmost Heaven; the Doctrine
is,
therefore, in itself
a
celestial
Doctrine, and the New Church in itself
a
celestial Church, but the
doctrine
is
accommodated to every state of reception from first to last,
and the Church consists of all who receive, from the wise, even to the
simple. Celestial perception

the perception of the truth that
is

;

is
no perception outside of doctrine.
10. Unanimity
is
a law inscribed upon the life of Heaven, and
ought to be inscribed upon the life of the Church. Important action
should not be taken without essential unanimity. A doubt gives occasion
for delay, that there may be further time for consideration and re
flection, in order to reach
a
common understanding.9
II
Swedenborg began his labours by translating meticu
lously the Scriptures from Hebrew and Greek, master
ing the languages before he began. He then selected those
sections of the Bible which most obviously and "in
teriorly" were the Word of God—the Pentateuch,
Joshua, Judges,
I
and II Samuel,
I
and II Kings, Psalms,
the Prophets from Isaiah to Malachi, the four Gospels
and Revelation. To him the Word was "divine truth
it
self as
it
exists with God." But
it
goes without saying
that this divine truth
is
utterly incomprehensible to any
finite mind. To render
it
at least partially intelligible,
it
must assume successively lower and lower forms of ex
pression adapted to the comprehension of various degrees
of finite intelligence.
It was the business of Swedenborg, after he cast off
the shackles of science, to penetrate and elucidate the in
ternal meanings of Holy Writ. Indeed
if
we mix the
doctrines of Theosophy and those of the New Church,
there
is
reason to believe that Emanuel was the shade of
St. John incarnate and that he was infinitely purified and
improved by years of roving in the astral realm, where

his spirit sat at the feet of mahatmas and hoary adepts.
For it is the common belief of those who today accept his
revelation that his labours not only transcended those of
John but even superseded the work performed by the
whole pack of inspired writers in the past. The most pro
nounced statements of the General Church of the New
Jerusalem make him nothing short of another Jesus. It
seems to me extremely difficult to put any other inter
pretation on the pronouncement of the General Church
as set forth in the early part of this century. There are
two principles, according to this statement, which form
the basis of New Church education:
The first of these principles was the practical acknowledgment of
the Lord Jesus Christ in His Second Coming: that He is present with
His Church in and by the Revelation of Divine Truth which has
been given in and by the Theological Writings of His Servant Emanuel
Swedenborg, the rational yet inspired unfolding of the Internal sense
of the Word and the Heavenly Doctrine of the New Jerusalem. This
acknowledgment involved the recognition of the Divine and therefore
infallible authority of these Writings, as being the Voice and Word
of God Himself, and not of a mere man.10
Indeed the statement of doctrine issued by the General
Church in 1926 is even more explicit:
This Second Coming was effected by means of a man, His Servant
Emanuel Swedenborg, before whom He manifested Himself in person,
and whom He filled with His Spirit, to teach the doctrines of the
New Church, through the Word, from Him.11
Before I pass to a brief resume of his most conspicuous
pronunciamentos, I cannot forego reference to the Diary
Spiritual and Earthly of James Johnston, a devotee of
the faith during the Eighteenth Century, who evidently
thought himself to be the counterpart of the sainted
Emanuel. This remarkable exhibit has been edited by
John Martin, who was privy to the heavenly transactions
of Johnston and thought it to the best interests of the

Church of the New Jerusalem that the work be pub
lished. Unfortunately the original manuscript was lost.
The person to whom it was entrusted came to New York,
where he fell to the wiles of a "cheap spiritualistic me
dium," and that lady deprived him of his valuable pos
session. But Mr. Martin, the editor, is convinced that the
published diary is true to form.
It was during the year 1840 that the author, Johnston,
approached Martin and gave him to understand that
they had been brought together for a most important
use:
. . . that his mission was to be altogether different to that of Sweden-
borg, viz. —of a representative character, which would require three
individuals to unite with the angels in their work.
He was accepted into the union and was "often present
at the meetings in the heavens, which I suppose was
necessary to my work, but my sight was only opened on
three occasions."
The diary he issues, however, in rapt faith. The angels
were strangers to Swedenborg while he was yet on earth
if the intimate associations of James Johnston are to be
believed. He records most casually the most lordly do
ings:
Abraham met me according to promise, and amongst other things
said he and St. John would come on Wednesday and bring with them
thirty-six kings.
On Wednesday it is recorded that
Accordingly, St. John introduced the thirty-six kings, and I gave to
each an offering of half-penny. ... So Abraham asked me the news.
Here we find reference to two of the most frequent
occurrences in Johnston's spirit wanderings. He was al
ways telling the angels the news and they were always
hitting him for money. Even on the most auspicious oc
casions, the angels are mendicants. One time there was a
heavenly convocation to install Johnston as the medium
between heaven and earth:

Abraham now came forward and spoke as follows: James, you are
now about to witness this solemn union for which we are assembled.
You are this day a witness for us on earth, chosen to record the end
of the former ages and the commencement of a new and everlasting
age. After the blessing, Abraham added, This is done and then he again
said, I know that our finances are very low, but let us trust to the
giver of all good. Let us freely give something to charity this day.
So he asked me what I could afford to give. I told him that he knew
how I stood, therefore I left it to himself what to give. So he said that
he would venture two shillings and sixpense . . .
Again
I was introduced into the assembly at the time appointed. St. John's
daughter was the speaker. . . .
To this entry he adds the significant postscript:
I omitted to say that Daniel took me by the hand when he came
in.
Even on the occasion when Johnston received a visit
from the first created man, this finited being concluded
with these words:
Acts of charity are the principle of the Church. I wish to perform
an act of the kind now. What can you give me?
It appears, however, that the money was always put to
charitable uses and that the frequent requests of the an
gels were merely an evidence of their big hearts:
David and Emanuel Swedenborg and along with them twelve female
angels. So E. S. said that these females wished to see me, and for
that they had come. So I thanked the females for the honour they did
me by their visit. So one of them said, I will say this on behalf of our
selves, that we are highly gratified to be in your company thus far, but
we see that you are at present too busily engaged with your work to
attend to us, therefore we wish you to meet us tomorrow morning,
in the meantime we hope that we may ask one favour, and that is to
lend amongst us sixpense to give to the wife of Pendlebury . . . w«
wish to perform some good on earth since we are here.
Still another time he records:
I received a visit from Solomon, who said thus: My earthly father,
David, desired me to wait upon you, as he and Emanuel Swedenborg
have gone out with the females.

SWEDENBORGIANISM 353
How reputable this Diary is in the annals of the New
Jerusalem, I cannot say. Its phenomena, however, are in
accord with the experience which Emanuel himself and
perfectly credible in the light of the teachings which he
set forth. It is claimed that only one of his twenty-nine
volumes on religious subjects deals with the spiritual
world. This particular one, however, is sufficiently defi
nite to warrant experiences of the most extravagant sort.
Swedenborg established to his own satisfaction the exist
ence of angels and spirits. Given this, it is not strange that
James Johnston rubbed shoulders with them daily.
The World of Spirits must be very sharply distin
guished from the spiritual world. This latter is a generic
term that embraces the whole range of disembodied be
ings, including those who perform acts of beneficence
with borrowed money and those who gibber eternally in
a tortuous hell. It also includes that great host of disem
bodied souls who roost neither in heaven nor down below.
These form the World of Spirits. Here they remain in a
state of preparation for their permanent home. Into this
chasm the angels sometimes fall, for Swedenborg records
in his diary that they are often expelled from heaven:
This takes place very often and daily certain spirits are expelled
from heaven and brought back to the inferior spirits. Certain of them
talked with me after they had been expelled.
This world of Spirits is believed by the Swedenbor-
gians to be the place which Jesus referred to as a great
gulf. It is described as a wide expanse between heaven
and hell—not located of course in a grossly physical way
between the two—so large that "to those in it it appears
as a globe or a world, full of spirits." It corresponds, if
I may be allowed to point the obvious congruity, to the
purgatory of the Romish sect and the kamaloka of An
nie Besant. As the Reverend Joseph J. Thornton of Glas
gow points out, it may be likened to the great Judgment
Hall which the dying enter. Swedenborg says of
it,
"It
is
a
region into which the opposing influence of good and
evil come; for
it
receives
a
copious exhalation of evils
from hell and
a
copious and continuous inflow of good

from heaven." (TCR, p. 745 ).12 As in the kamaloka of
theosophy, the duration of the sojourn varies here with
the good and bad. Reverend Thornton says:
Those who, in this life, have been so far regenerated as to have
overcome such evils and oppose the Divine order, "are taken up into
heaven immediately" [AC, p. 1850]. With the inwardly wicked the
case is entirely opposite. Such as have filled up the measure of their
wickedness with wiles and have used goodness, as a means of deceiving,
are immediately sent into hell. [AC, p. 1850]
13
There are few of either extreme in the World of
Spirits. The vast majority of departed souls reside for
some time in the World of Spirits and pass through three
states. Reverend Thornton, speaking before the Inter
national Swedenborgian Conference, said, that in the
first state they are able to be recognized by friends and
that they show some of their earthly abilities. In the
second, they "act more freely from their real affections;
their qualities appear without disguise; and while the
inwardly wicked act more foolishly and insanely, the
good act more wisely than ever before." The third state,
if it is reached, is one of instruction.
In the second state, everyone makes a genuine revela
tion of character. This cannot be too greatly emphasized.
Swedenborg tells of certain naughty spirits who thought
they could deceive God.
They denied the crimes and enormities they had perpetuated in the
world. Lest they should be supposed to be innocent, all their actions
were laid open and recounted in order from their own memory. They
were chiefly adulteries and whoredoms. [HH, p. 462]
It is here, then, that the Divine Judgment of human
ity takes place; here the souls of men are read as open
books, and every man is judged according to the deeds
done in the flesh—it is now too late for repentance or sal
vation from the Lord.

by initials, and for very good reason. Thus, TCR stands for The True Christian
Religion, Containing the Universal Theology of the New Church Foretold bj

Swedenborg taught that two Judgments had been en
acted before his appearance and Revelation. The first was
the Flood, the second the advent of Christ, and the third
in the year 1757. This Last Judgment, like the others,
took place in the World of Spirits and did not touch
those who had previously ascended into Heaven or
pitched headlong into Hell. It cleared the World of
•Spirits, "removing vast myriads, so that they no longer
intercepted the flow of goodness and truth to the souls
of men." It was, Thornton tells us,
a great and general judgment upon those who had been permitted to
tarry longer than others in the world of spirits; that
is,
upon nominal
Christians, Mohammedans, Gentiles who were externally civil and
moral but not interiorly lovers of the Lord and their neighbours.14
These had set up fictious and pseudo heavens in false
security, and these the Lord quickly demolished. All of
this took place in the year A. D. 1757 and of its "actual
execution, character, and order, he [Swedenborg] was
made the prepared witness." The World of Spirits was
thus cleared of the infernal hordes that had been con
gregating there since the Lord's first coming and were
holding in prison many of the simple good.
The Second Advent of the Lord Jesus Christ was co
incident with this colossal purification of the world of
Spirits (1757). Thornton tells us that one of the pro
visions made by the Lord "for the safety and final exal
tation of his faithful ones
is
that which
is
parabolically
described in Revelation as the thousand years, during
which time the faithful are preserved from communica
tion with, and contamination by the seductive spirits then
infesting the world of Spirits." The Lord then fulfilled
his promise and came again and removed the ascendancy
of evil spirits.
So Divine Truth came into the world. He prepared Swedenborg
to be the human recipient, seer and scribe, by means of whose labours
he could give to this world
a
true understanding of the Holy Word,
together with many facts relating to the other life and
a
system of
philosophy and theology such as should suffice for the rational faculties
of men. ..."

He came, not in the flesh, but as lightning, according to
His prophecies.
After the souls have passed through the intermediate
state, the oasis between heaven and hell, they naturally
go to congregate with like-minded spirits. Thus the good
ascend into heaven. The wicked are not sent to hell, but
they simply go of their own sinful will and accord to the
society most .harmonious to their appetites. Thornton says
that the Lord is really good to those in Hell, that he is
ever full of great sympathy for them, but this "does not
annihilate the ever-horrible conditions that are superin
duced on the wicked by their own self-will." They ap
propriate only the bad things of the spiritual realm, "just
as poisonous and noxious weeds only use the heat of the
sun to ripen the most deadly juices." In Hell, says one
writer, one evil spirit wants to be master over another,
and finds his greatest joy in tormenting others. They are
kept in prisons and workhouses and severely punished for
their wickedness ; for the fear of punishment is in that
world "the only means by which their evils can be sub
dued" (HH, p. 509).
There is neither feasting nor psalms in the Sweden-
borgian City of God. Heaven is a place alive with the
energetic ministrations of angels, who derive their chief
pleasure from serving those on earth. There are no sepa
rately created angels. Swedenborg resents such an idea
most decidedly. Heaven is the reward of righteousness,
though it is not, curiously, entirely free from wickedness.
The angels, he tells us, are continually "advancing in the
Springtime of life," that "women who have died old and
worn out with age, if they have lived in faith in the Lord,
and in charity toward their neighbour, come, with the
succession of years, more and more into the flower of
youth and early womanhood." The angels, being led of
the Lord, are organized into societies. They always seek
the good of others and their occupations always "give
them unfailing delights."
The angels in heaven, as I have said, are not uniformly
good and wise. Their beauty is indescribable, but it varies
with the amount of Divine Truth soaked up. Their gar

having clothes of lustrous light, the next in rank having
bright and white garments, while the still lower have
coloured garments. The houses and scenery vary with the
various states, and there are spacious temples for the wor
ship of the Lord. The wisest are made governors of the
Various societies.
Swedenborg's view of death makes the "thought of go
ing hence positively attractive." He describes, from ac
tual experience, the process of dying and of being raised
to life in the other world. It was granted him to pass
through a state "nearly" like that of dying persons. He
tells us that when the respiration of the body was "almost
taken away," the respiration of the spirit remained. Com
munication was opened with the Lord's celestial king
dom in Heaven; angels were present; his own ideas were
taken away and his thoughts were received from the an
gels. "There was a drawing, and as it were, an attractive
force, pulling and extricating the spirit from the body;
light shone round about him and the angels crowded near
and sought to render service and to convey instruction"
(AC, p. 168, and HH, p. 449). He records in his diary
spiritual intelligence received from the angels to this
effect: "That man loses nothing of those things which
he possessed in the body life of the body, except the body
alone. Each man as he dies carries with him all the things
which belong to him as a natural man —his natural mem
ory included. "He retains everything he has read, seen,
learned, thought in the world; though natural things are
quiescent unless 'reproduced as the Lord pleases.'
"
To the Reverend John Goddard we are indebted for
the most tender thought of death of the Swedenborgian
Variety. He says that, "Whether one has lived well or ill,
angels from the highest realms are with him during the
sleep of death and during the first part of the wakening."
Death does not extend "beyond the time of our Lord's
sojourn in the sepulchre or beyond the third day." Dur

awakening these ministers of the Lord surround the dy

and love and peace—a sense of being carefully and tend
erly cared for. No evil influences, no anxious states are
permitted to approach. No thought of death is present,
but only life, life more abundant, life eternal, life blessed
and happy. ... At birth into the other world, the holiest
influences draw near.16
Then for the waking up. First comes dim conscious
ness, then more complete, then all the normal faculties
respond, and "one finds himself in a body and world as
complete in every respect as the body and world here.
All is substantial and real. ... So natural is it all that
one does not realize, until he is told, that he has changed
worlds. At first his companions are the highest and holiest
angels, who remain until they perceive their presence is
no longer congenial or useful." Finally he is surrounded
by just the angels he needs and for a time 'lives a life
not very dissimilar to the one he lived in the world. His
memory of the world is still quite active. He thinks of
his friends and his thought may bring their inward pres
ence, but he cannot see them or hear them, or touch them,
because the substances of the higher world, real as they
are, do not shade off into the substance of this, but are
wholly distinct in kind, the one never interfering with
the other." "
Prophet that he was, Swedenborg had a deal to say of
sex. Those of our salacious epoch who expect to find in
his works nourishment for their mental passions will,
however, be moderately disappointed. One of his works
is entitled, Conjugial Love and Its Chaste Delights and
offers the alluring subtitle, Adulterous Love and Its Sin
ful Pleasures. Nothing is to be found in the book but a
pompous soliloquy upon the dire effects of fornication
and concupiscence. He regarded conjugal love as a love
of the spirit, the marriage of kindred minds welded and
sealed by the benedictions of a solicitous God, and any
deviation from the course it plotted was sure to end disas
trously. Already we have seen what happens in hell to
those who practise sodomy ; any other kind of pervert is

liable to the same consignment if Swedenborg's Illumina
tion is authentic. While he himself never married, he had
solid ideas of those who did and he issued encyclicals
which made monogamy invulnerable both now and in
eternity.
It is clear that he assigned sex an important place in
the life of man and woman, but, to his mind, the whole
problem could be rather well taken care of through
monogamy. He followed Schmidius's translation of Jesus'
statement, "He that looketh upon a woman to lust hath
already committed adultery in his own heart," thus mak
ing it read, "He that looketh upon another's woman, etc."
This impregnable view of conjugal love carries over into
the glory land, for in Heaven and Hell, Swedenborg
gives us this report:
I once heard an angel describing love truly conjugial and its heavenly
delights in this manner: That it is the Divine of the Lord in the
heavens —which is the Divine good and the Divine truth—united in
two beings, yet in such a manner that they are not two but as one.
He said that two conjugial partners in heaven are that love, because
every one is his own good and his own truth, as to mind, as well as to
body; for the body is effigy of the mind, because formed in its likeness.
Hence he concluded that the Divine is effigied in two, who are in love
truly conjugial; and because the Divine is effigied in them, so also is
heaven. [HH, p. 374.]
Despite his wholly sacramental view of marriage, there
are passages in the Writings which have given pause and
pain to the pillars of the New Church. In his book, The
Delights of Wisdom pertaining to Conjugial Love after
Which Follow the Pleasures pertaining to Scortatory
Love he describes certain circumstances in which little
slips of virtue may be allowable. He proclaims that
. . . those who for various causes cannot enter into marriage, and on
account of salacity cannot control their lusts, it is possible that this
conjugial love may be preserved if the wandering love of the sex be
confined to one mistress.
Also he confesses that
. . . pellicacy is to be preferred to wandering lust, if only it be not
entered into with more than one; and not with a virgin or unravished

woman; nor with a married woman; and if it be kept apart from
conjugial loves.
There is no approach through pellicacy to the kinds
of lust most dangerous to conjugal love: the lust of de
floration, the lust of varieties, the lust of violation, and
the lust of seducing innocence. Thus
.... with those who labour under raging heat and cannot for many
reasons hasten and anticipate marriage, there seems no other refuge
and as it were asylum than to take a mistress, called in French a
maitresse.
It is possible that in this way conjugal flames may be
kept glowing and, too, a boy who in puberty is unable to
distinguish between fornication and debauchery may "in
pellicacy which is a more regulated and saner fornica
tion learn and see the distinctions." Of course excessive
fornications lead to all sorts of trouble, such as constant
want, and
. . . also foulness and immodesties, in consequence of which conjugial
love in its cleanness and chastity cannot be perceived and felt, and thus
neither in its sweetness nor in the delightfulness of its flower.
All "the dainties of conjugial love are taken away" and
"conjugial sports turned into tragical scenes."
In commenting on Swedenborg's entertainment of sex,
Mr. Charles H. Mann of Elkhart, Indiana, observes that
this particular book was written about "The Pleasures of
Insanity" and that its decretals do not operate in the case
of the average man. He says :
But even if one man should concede (as I do not) that Swedenborg in
tended to teach that certain milder forms of concubinage can be toler
ated as modes of practical living, the fact of his inculcating such a
yielding to the demons of the flesh as justifiable in his day would not
imply a corresponding compromise with immortality today.18
A prophet is not without honour, save in a later day
when his observations seem old-fashioned even to the
chaste.

If space allowed and the material were not so tedious,
something should be said of the other doctrines. When
simmered down to monosyllables, however the bulk of
the remainder do not differ from standard Christian dog
mas any more than the Republicans do from the Demo
crats. Take the doctrine of the Trinity, which is either a
tenet or a puzzle in most theologies. The Swedenbor-
gians teach that there is no trinity of persons in the God
head, but rather a trinity of essentials: the Father is Di
vine Love itself; the Son is Divine Truth; and the Holy
Spirit is the Divine Proceeding eternally operating in the
preservation and regeneration of man. The different
names signify different attributes—which is about all, as
far as I can detect, that the dogma amounts to in any
Christian creed, for upon no point is the average bishop
more vague or ridiculous than upon the personality of the
Holy Ghost.
Swedenborg claimed to restore the original teachings
of Christianity and to set them upon a new, rational, and
advanced basis. Indeed degeneracy had proceeded to a
grave extent in the Christian Church when the seer had
his visions; not only so, but doubt and scepticism were on
a rampage. Descartes and Leibnitz moulded the philoso
phy of the day, and in contradiction to their teachings,
Swedenborg entered the lists and, as I have said, spirit
ualized what little idealism was left. He demolished
ideas of sacramentalism, unhorsed the idea of Jesus's vi
carious death and atonement, and taught the Humanity
of a God who had hitherto been removed from the haunts
of man by craven adoration and pagan philosophism. All
the decadence which the Prophet saw about him tended,
in his mind, to destroy the real Christian Church and to
make another revelation from God necessary to restore
the kingdom.
The first movement toward the organization began in
London in 1782 when a printer, Robert Hindmarsh,
formed a class for the study of the writings. Gradually
a society developed, and in 1788 the first public services

were held. The first society of the New Church in
America was organized in Baltimore in 1792; in 1922
the Convention or regular branch reported a member
ship of 107 churches composed of 7066 persons. The nu
merical strength of the body has never been as great as it
seemed, but the sapient character of its members, to
gether with the audacity and vigour of its literature, has
made it a sect of extraordinary influence.
In recent years the General Church of the New Jeru
salem, which separated from the Convention in 1897, has
grown enormously both in influence and prestige. This
branch of the New Church has headquarters at Bryn
Athyn, Pennsylvania, where the Academy of the New
Church is located. It was, in fact, the growth of the Acad
emy which gave rise to the independence of this division.
For over one hundred years before the Academy was
founded (in 1877), it had become apparent to certain
rigorous members of the New Church that the body was
growing lax in the importance and authority attached to
the Writings; there were those who felt that, though the
Writings were beautiful and edifying they were by no
means divinely inspired ; there were others who believed
that the Writings might even become antiquated. It was
against the growth of such egregious heresies that the
founders of the Academy set their faces. They deter
mined that by a process of education the offspring of
New Church members would be properly indoctrinated
and kept within the fold. Then upon the separation of
the General Church from the Convention in 1897 the
properties of the Academy were taken over and the work
of the General Church has since that time centered
around the educational work performed at Bryn Athyn.
During the fifty years since its founding, the Academy
has grown to be a first-rate educational institution, com
prising all departments from kindergarten to graduate
work recognized by the highest universities. It publishes
three times a year The Journal of Education, which com
pares in tone and format quite favourably with any of
the pedagogical quarterlies and has nothing to distinguish
it greatly from the rest unless it be a preoccupation with

the writings of Swedenborg. The Bryn Athyn Cathedral,
which attracts more than a hundred thousand visitors a
year, is another feature which has brought this branch
to the fore. The Cathedral required six years for its con
struction, and its central tower rises one hundred and
fifty feet from the ground.
Some touch of realism is needed to bring this sketch
to a close. That touch is well provided by the behaviour
of Swedenborgians during the late war. With the reve
lation of the interior meanings of the Word which the
seer gave, and with all the claims which the New Church
lays to distinction in doctrine and conduct, we should ex
pect to find the writers of the sect presenting ideas dur
ing the war hysteria somewhat at variance with those of
the bulk of Christian ministers. But in the annals of The
New Church Review, official organ of the Convention,
one finds the same fatuous Scriptural condonement of the
War that is to be found in any journal of the period. Thus
E. H. Schneider quotes from Swedenborg to the effect
that "no idea can be had of spiritual life except what is
in civil life" and proceeds with the following observa
tions :
The Bride, the Lamb's wife, seeks an abode and resting place on
earth ; she cannot live in the poisonous atmosphere of autocracy ; that is
a proved fact; she is very uncomfortable in the atmosphere of autoc
racy. She can rear her offspring of spiritual good and truth only
in the sphere of mutual love and respect. After a thunderstorm the
lungs breathe purer air. After fermentation the wine is clear and the
dregs are at the bottom. . . . Monarchy like dregs is falling to the
bottom and we may rest assured that after this war no sane person
will dare to stand up before the people and defend monarchy. After
this fermentation in which the thought learns to distinguish clearly
the evil of monarchy, comes temptations in which the affections are
purified from substances which adhere to this fallacy. This is when the
New Church will reveal its real strength. On the plane of conscience
or spiritual good and truth, the New Church stands pre-eminent and
alone. 19
He feels that by the war the world was being cleansed
and prepared for the true Christian spirit.

commandment, Thou shalt not kill. Mr. Schack explains
that this command was given to natural or primitive man
and that it can be comfortably modified in the case of men
who can distinguish between good and evil motives. He
then shows that it is quite allowable for the allied sol
diers to kill Germans because they are prompted by a
lofty movement. Further :
... it is wrong and not allowable for the Germans, or those who
represent aggression and wrong, to kill a single British, French or Ameri
can soldier for those purposes or to take a single human life. They,
however, do it though it is not allowable but directly contrary to the law
of God, and they are also violating every other command of God.
The adroitness of his Swedenborgian mind will be seen
in the manner by which he wiggles out of the next diffi
culty. The Bible says, "Love your enemies."
Can we kill and at the same time love them, and reject hatred of
them ? Yes. There is no man or no nation so wicked but that we should
have some hope and desire and even be willing to pray, as indeed the
Lord told us to do, that if possible they might be led to repent of their
wickedness and finally be saved.20
He feels that possibly "among so many Germans there
may be some who are fighting for love of country, and
who, having been deceived by those in authority, really
do believe that their cause is just, and that they have
right on their side."
Perhaps it is unfair to throw the war-thinking of any
group into its face now that the War is over. I have no
doubt that Schack and Schneider have repented. Yet it is
obvious that war, like drunkenness, reduces us to our ac
tual selves. In war we are as we are all the time, except
more so. It must be a matter of chagrin to the followers
of Swedenborg that, with all "the complete Distinctive
ness of the New Church" and "the utterly vastated con
dition of the Old Church in all things, external and inter
nal," and with all its highblown claims to transcendent
social ethics, it had nothing to offer humanity in its last
great crisis but gory exegesis.

MORMONISM
THOSE who think that Mormonism has become de
funct since the Saints began the heretical practice of
monogamy, need only to have a look at the creed of Sena
tor Smoot, or read the strident tracts of any one of the
present Twelve Apostles. The menace has abated, to be
sure, and public interest has declined, for, as a people,
we are never actively concerned with anything that is not
a menace. No books, for example, appear today under
such a title as Uncle Sam's Abscess, and, in the main, our
view has become benign and tolerant. The Mormons have
become good Americans, and that suffices. During 1919
four Western Senators arose on the floor of the Senate
chamber and thanked God for the sober and solid cit
izenry of Utah, citing in evidence the fact that the Mor
mons yielded readily their quota to the draft and over
subscribed every patriotic drive launched among them.
What is more, two writers have recently pointed out that
Mormon mothers have more babies than any other
American women (i every 4.4 years, to be exact), and
this is further evidence of the sound and dependable citi
zens to be found among the Saints today. Though only
half the population of Salt Lake City is Mormon, both
the Kiwanis and Rotary Clubs protested bitterly when
the English novelist, Winifred Gates, tossed a brick at
the Mormons a few years back. Indeed the Mormons
have become so much like the Baptists that unless the
Apostle Talmage, say, is discovered to have eleven wives
concealed in his cellar, where they are starved, beaten,
and periodically ravished, the public will soon forget

this astounding American religion which built an em
pire, defied the federal government for years, outraged
Christendom in general, and even today numbers more
than seven hundred thousand adherents.
I have said that New Thought was our distinctive con
tribution to the faiths of mankind. In a sense it is. It
represents our rollicking optimism, our sturdy belief that
we are the chosen of the Lord, not as a race, but as in
dividuals. Yet to be exact, Mormonism is undoubtedly
the most indigenous of them all. Theosophy comes from
India, Bahaism from Persia, Russellism from the He
brew Scriptures, Rosicrucianism from the land of the
Hun, and so on down the line. Each of the others is in
some measure exotic, a transplanted religion which finds
congenial soil upon our continent. Not so with Mormon
ism. It was made in America, and that fact is appro
priately stamped all over its bottom. Its Bible came into
being at Palmyra, New York, it proclaimed Zion first
in Illinois and later in Utah, its prophet's name was
Smith, its sacred history deals with North and South
America, with landmarks familiar to us all, and not with
events in far off Judea. Its exodus took place across the
plains of our continent, its Red Sea was the Mississippi,
and when the last trumpet sounds Jesus is coming to
American soil, with headquarters in Salt Lake City. It's
all very real. And Senator Smoot sees all our material
improvements as the harbingers of that glad day when
earth's palingenesis shall be complete and the righteous
shall gather in Zion. And it is just as timely as it is real.
We are now living, says the Senator, in the Fullness of
Times: "This age is destined to witness the consumma
tion of God's purposes in relation to this planet."
The story told by the Book of Mormon is after this
fashion:
There was a man named Lehi who lived with his wife
and four sons in Jerusalem during the closing years of
the Seventh Century B. C. There came to him at that peril
ous time the word which came to so many Jews : he was
told to flee into a far country. He obeyed the divine com

mand, and with his children and another family wan
dered for eight years in the Arabian desert, during which
time Lehi and his faithful son, Nephi, had many mar
vellous revelations from God. They finally came to a halt
on the shores of the Arabian sea, where they received a
divine command to build a ship and launch out into the
deep. By faith they accomplished this, and within a short
time the party was headed for South America. They
reached that land without mishap, and because of its lux
uriance and fertility, they prospered and multiplied.
With properity came vicissitudes and dissensions.
Nephi was not the only son of Lehi; indeed there was
another very wicked son, and he was called Laman.
Quarreling commenced between the Nephites, who stood
for righteousness and Jehovah, and the Lamanites who
stood for idolatry and licentiousness. The Nephites pros
pered and grew fair of skin and beautiful to look upon,
while the Lamanites degenerated and God cursed them
with a ruddy skin. Things went on, with the Lamanites,
despite their sinfulness, becoming more powerful, for
they were a fierce and warlike band. The Nephites, how
ever, retained divine favour. At the time of His resurrec
tion and ascension, Jesus Christ came over and ministered
unto the Nephites. It was, by the way, to these Nephites
He referred when He said, "Other sheep have I which
are not of this fold."
But righteousness does not always triumph imme-
mediately. As a matter of fact, the Lamanites finally de
stroyed the Nephites in 429 A. D., and the final battle was
staged near Palmyra, New York. The Lamanites fur
ther degenerated and, of course, became the Indians
which Columbus found in the islands and other explorers
in their subsequent voyages. But the Nephites did not
pass without record of their doings. Those records were
stored safely in the golden tablets of what later became
known as the Book of Mormon. There were to be found
the instructions which they had received from God all
along and from Jesus Christ when he came back from
Jerusalem after his ascension. Thus it is that the Book

of Mormon merely supplements the Bible, and, quite
naturally, has equal footing with the other words of Holy
Writ in Mormon belief.
It was to. Joseph Smith, Jr., the son of a well-digger,
that this delightful document was first revealed. It was
originally inscribed upon heavy gold tablets and it was
through Joseph's diligence that the story was translated
from the "reformed Egyptian" in which it was written
to the high-sounding rhetoric of the book as we have it
today. Problems of textual and higher criticism start up
from every bush along the way, but we have neither the
time nor the right to scamper after them. More has been
written about the divine authenticity of the Book of Mor
mon than about any other moot matter on the human
record, unless it be the Genesis account of creation. It
suffices to say that foes of the Latter-Day faith are of one
accord: The Book was a fraud and utterly preposterous.
The Church itself continues warmly to defend its ethereal
origin and it has sent many eloquent and earnest advo
cates to the bar in the Book's defence. Either the book
came from God or it was the labour of human hand. If
it came from God, there's an end to the discussion.
I have space to cast in brief review only one theory
of the sceptics. That theory rests upon the case of Solo
mon Spaulding, a Congregational minister and mer
chant who died in 1816. The story has it that Spaulding,
while resident at Conneaut, Ohio, became interested in
the Indian mounds of the vicinity and later wrote a story
purporting to give an account of early Indian history. He
called his fraud Manuscript Found, and asserted that he
had unearthed it in one of the many mounds about Con
neaut. He was in the habit of reading the manuscript to
neighbours, so that it acquired extensive popularity.
In 181 2 Spaulding is said to have gone to Pittsburgh
for the purpose of getting his manuscript published. The
theory next has it that Spaulding left the manuscript with
a printer in Pittsburgh and that Sidney Rigdon, a Camp-
bellite preacher of Mentor, Ohio, obtained a copy and
with Joseph Smith at Palmyra contrived to make the
whole thing into the Book of Mormon. The connexion

with Rigdon is made by the son of the printer with whom
the manuscript was left in Pittsburg. The Mormon tra
dition has
it,
however, that in 1830 certain Mormon mis
sionaries, on the way West, called upon Rigdon at
Mentor, Ohio, and showed him the Book of Mormon for
the first time. He finally embraced the faith, left the
Campbellites, and founded
a
Mormon church in the com
munity.
Really the whole discussion
is
bootless. It
is
enough
for us to know that Brother Smith found the golden tab
lets at Palmyra. He was
a
young man who had previously
been converted —or half-converted as the orthodox now
say—in
a
Methodist revival. This left him in
a
quandary.
He looked about and tried to decide which church to
join, for there were scads of sects in the neighbourhood.
But, as Widtstoe points out in his book, Joseph Smith As
a Scientist, the lad, then fourteen years of age, went about
to decide the matter in
a
scientific manner. "Conse
quently he went out into
a
quiet grove and asked God to
reveal the truth to him." The result was all that any
scientist could wish, for God Himself came down out of
heaven to the unlettered boy and brought Jesus Christ
along with Him. Joseph testifies, and the testimony
is
to
this day an inlaid feature of the Mormon tradition: "I
saw two personages whose brightness and glory defy all
description, standing above me in the air. One of them
spoke to me, calling me by name, and said (pointing to
the other), 'This
is
my Beloved Son, hear Him.' "
Immediately the child inquired which sect was right
and proper. But Jesus Christ replied that he "must join
none of them," that in point of fact he, Joseph Smith, had
been chosen in divine circles to establish, rather to re
establish, the real Church of Jesus Christ on earth. This
was cheerful news to
a
lad not over fourteen years of
age, and the vision made him exceedingly self-conscious
and given to Swedenborgian illusions in the skies. To
these he had in fact always been addicted, just as had
Mother Besant and Emanuel of the Church of the New
Jerusalem. But, says Nephi Lowell Morris, in his very

Fulfillment, such supernatural experiences and visions
and communications were only normal in a lad who was
destined to be so great a prophet. Moreover, says Morris,
if these dreams, visions, and communications were neces
sary to the prophets of old, they were necessary to Joseph
Smith, and to deny them would be to undermine all
prophecy since the days of Adam.
This was the "first and most glorious of his revela
tions," and it occurred in the year 1820. The next came
along in 1823. Joseph reports that he was alone in prayer
when "immediately a personage appeared at my bed
side," and that personage turned out to be none other than
the angel Moroni. Moroni told Joseph as they talked to
gether that there was a book deposited, "written upon
gold plates," which told the authentic story of the pre
vious inhabitants upon this continent and further that
"the fullness of the everlasting gospel was contained in
it,
as delivered by the Saviour to the ancient inhabitants."
Moroni also spake unto him saying that there were
likewise (just as God would have it) two media with the
tablets, known as Urim and Thummim, which would
enable Joseph to translate the tablets without difficulty.
He was further instructed by Moroni that
if
he dared
show either the plates or the ponies to any one, he would
be destroyed. As the angel talked, Joseph saw with un
failing eye the place where the tablets reposed, so clearly
did he see the place in fact that he recognized
it
the next
day when he went to get them. But the time was not yet
ripe. This was
a
place "convenient to the village of Man
chester, Ontario County, New York."
In 1827, the fullness of time having come, Joseph
called for the plates. Again the heavenly messenger
charged him that he tell no man. And no sooner did Jo
seph have the plates than he realized the value of the
warning. He declares that the "most strenuous exertions
were used to get them from me; every stratagem that
could be invented was resorted to for that purpose." But,
noble Prophet that he was, Joseph Smith persevered.
He kept the plates safe from mortal eye, save the eyes
of three selected witnesses, until he had completed his

translation, with the kindly assistance of Urim and
Thummim, and then the messenger called for them and
they were returned to him for ever.
A testimony signed by three witnesses, Oliver Cowd-
ery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, appeared on
the Book of Mormon when it was first published,
solemnly declaring that these men had seen the sacred
plates with the "eye of faith," and with the naked eye as
well. Two of the witnesses, Cowdery and Whitmer, were
later chased out of Missouri when eighty Mormons de
clared that they were thieves and counterfeiters. The
third, Harris, pressed by a lawyer in Palmyra, amended
his testimony: "Why, I did not see them as I do that
pencil case, yet I saw them with the eye of faith. I saw
them just as distinctly as I saw anything about me—
though at the time they were covered over with a cloth."
Unfortunately, too, all three of the witnesses became
apostates of the faith. Cowdery went so far as to join'
the Methodist Church and to become superintendent
of the Sunday School at Tiffin, Ohio. He was later re-
baptised. Whitmer deserted after the adoption of polyg
amy and founded a small sect known as The Church of
Christ. Harris, who was roundly discredited by Smith,
first joined the Shakers and then became a missionary to
England for a small sect of Mormons that split off from
the main trunk. The flyleaf of the Book of Mormon that
bears the Testimony of the Three Witnesses carries "And
Also the Testimony of the Eight Witnesses." This state
ment contains the affirmation that "we have seen and
hefted and known of a surety that the said Smith has got
the plates of which we have spoken."
There was really no way to check the translation of the
Book of Mormon, for the angel took the plates away
with him after Smith had made his rendition. A later
book, however, has been tested among the scholars. That
was what Joseph Smith called The Book of Abraham.
He got it from Michael H. Chandler, a travelling show
man who came to Kirtland, Ohio, in 1833, with Egyptian
mummies and other curiosities. He bought some rolls of
papyri from Chandler and declared immediately that

he had a sacred document written by the holy hand of
Abraham. This he translated at once and it became a part
of the Mormon almanac of belief. Smith published a
crude reproduction of the hieroglyphics and drawings
of the papyri along with his translations. These were
submitted in 191 2 to eight outstanding scholars versed
in Egyptian lore, and one and all of these savants de
clared that the Egyptian scenes and figures were but poor
copies of the original and that they were ordinary funeral
apparatus having no more to do with Abraham than with
William Dean Howells. Dr. John Peters of the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania declared that the text and inter
pretation "displays an amusing ignorance." James H.
Breasted of the University of Chicago declared that the
Book of Abraham "very clearly demonstrates that he
[Joseph Smith] was totally unacquainted with the sig
nificance of these documents and absolutely ignorant of
the simplest facts of Egyptian writing and civilization."
The word "Mormon" as given in the Century Diction
ary is from a Greek word meaning "bugbear," and in
zoology it is the name of several animals, including the
baboon. But Joseph Smith didn't know this. His own
explanation was that since "mo" is the Egyptian word
for good, by a simple addition of "more" or "mor," the
contraction, we get the word "Mormon," which literally
means "more good." (Times and Seasons.) The truth is
that the term "Mormon" has been pretty well abandoned
among the Saints, and when it appears in their writings,
it is always in quotation marks. They prefer rather to call
themselves The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints."
The Words of Mormon, however, form a part of the
book that bears the name. In 3 Nephi V, 20, we read:
"I am Mormon and a pure descendant of Lehi." And the
Words of Mormon begins: "And now, I, Mormon, be
ing about to deliver up the record which I have been
making, into the hands of my son, Moroni, behold I have
witnessed almost all of the destruction of my people, the
Nephites." The first edition of the book bore the words,

tents, "By Joseph Smith, Junior, Author and Proprietor."
These words seemed a little brazen, too much like a res
taurant sign, as it were, and the later editions merely
credit Smith with the translation. The Book tells us that
there were on this continent even before the people of
Lehi got here, another race, the Jaredites, who came di
rectly after the confusion of tongues and were wholly de
stroyed before Lehi and his caravan arrived. The doings
of the Lehis were carefully preserved on various plates,
until they fell into the hands of one of Lehi's descend
ants, Mormon, who had an abridgment of them made in
384 A. D., and after burying the original plates in a hill
he gave the abridgment to his son, Moroni, who boxed the
affair, together with a story of the people of Jared and
buried them both in the hill "Cumorah in New York,
400 A. D.
A good portion of the sacred tome is lifted bodily from
the Bible. Hyde in his book, Mormonism, tells us that in
the first 428 pages there are 298 direct quotations from
the New Testament, and many chapters from both the
Old and New Testaments appear bodily in the Book of
Mormon. These quotations are from the Authorized Ver
sion of the English Bible, and, as Snowden cleverly points
out, they appear errors and all. The phrase of Shake
speare "the undiscovered country from whose bourne no
traveller returns" was used in 2 Nephi I, 14, twenty-two
hundred years before the bard was born. Reference is
made to the Gospel and to Christ six hundred years be
fore Christ ever came to earth or before the Christian
Churches were established. Christ appeared, as I have
said, to these people in America, preached great ser
mons to them from the mount and invited the whole
curious multitude to come and poke their fingers in his
side and feel the prints of the nails upon his hands and
feet. The emigration of Jared was accomplished upon
eight barges the length of a street, says the holy Book;
these barges were tossed about for three hundred and
forty-four days, carrying not only the passengers, but food
for all, together with more flocks and herds than Noah
ever thought of getting on the ark.

374 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
Upon these golden plates rest the sturdy and ample
buttocks of the present Mormon Church. Here is the
great American invention in the things of the spirit, a
religion which gives us our own peculiar contact with
God, and makes Gentiles of the Jews. For Joseph Smith
restored the Church of Jesus Christ and those who
do not accept the restoration but continue to hanker after
heresies are in danger of landing in the lowest order of
the graded Mormon hell.
II
Most folk, as I say, have come to regard the traditions
as interesting and to think wistfully of the tales Mamma
used to tell about the Mormons. The belief prevails that
the body is defunct and that it has surrendered its theol
ogy. To set ourselves aright on this item we need only to
read the writings of the modern authors of the faith. I
confess that the younger members of the Church, as in
all churches today, are properly shamefaced and silent
upon the mysteries. They talk much of fruits and have
little to say of roots. They talk of the fecundity of Mor
mon mothers and the success of the Liberty Loan. But
in its essentials the Faith remains unchanged and the gos
pel is spreading at a rate which few of the regular
branches of Christianity can equal. I have previously
alluded to The Prophecies of Joseph Smith and Their
Fulfillment, by Elder Morris. This is a book which was
published in 1926, and at no moment of Mormon history
could the devotion to the Prophet have been greater.
Morris regards a Prophet as one who has been "di
vinely designated to speak and act for God, and is com
missioned with divine authority for the purpose of guid
ing, directing, and instructing mankind in the things of
God." It is his abiding conviction that "we are now in
the Dispensation of the Fullness of Times." This is the
Dispensation referred to by the Apostle Peter and sub
scribed to by Senator Smoot. The instrument that gave us
this Dispensation which, as we have seen, will culminate
in the millennial reign of Christ, was none other than

Joseph Smith. As expressed by Morris, reiterated by the
Apostle Talmadge and believed by the vast majority
of adult Mormons, John the Baptist, "who held the keys
of the Lesser or Aaronic Priesthood in the earlier dis
pensation, appeared in his resurrected state and ordained
Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery." Later the presid
ing three of the first Twelve Apostles, to wit, Peter,
James, and John, ordained these men to "the holy apostle-
ship, conferring upon them the higher or Melchizedek
Priesthood. . . ." It must be emphasized that the pow
ers thus conferred upon Joseph Smith of Palmyra, New
York were the same which Jesus, Moses, and Elias con
ferred upon Peter, James, and John during the mystical
experience on the mount of Transfiguration. These pow
ers were transferred to Joseph Smith for the inaugura
tion of the New Dispensation on earth and the re-
establishment of the Church of Jesus Christ. Morris says
that Joseph thus had "transmitted to him, for the benefit
and endowment of the Church in this day and age, the
powers and keys of all preceding dispensations. They
were literally bestowed upon him and his associates at the
hands of angels, who were either resurrected or trans
lated beings, men who had ministered on earth in former
dispensations."
Therefore, says Mr. Morris, Joseph Smith must in
no wise be confused with the many reformers who have
founded sects, nor is he to be regarded as no better than
Calvin, Mother Eddy, or, let me add, Baha'u'llah. For,
like all the rest, Smith did not found a sect. He was
simply an instrument in the hands of God for the estab
lishment of the Church of Jesus Christ in these days of
apostasy. All churches were wrong and Joseph Smith
was sent to set them right. The Church of Jesus Christ
of the Latter-Day Saints claims no apostolic succession,
for all priesthoods save its own have gone off after the
whore of the world. It claims rather an apostolic res
toration. And in achieving this, says Morris, "Joseph
Smith stands exactly where the ancient prophets stood:
in direct communication with heaven, acting under di
vine commission and authority. After being ordained to

the Holy Priesthood at the hands of resurrected men, he
became the mouthpiece of God, and with the authority
and keys of the Apostleship, under divine instruction he
organized The Church."
Smith became known as the Prophet, Seer, and Reve-
lator. Not only is he so regarded today by Mormon fol
lowers, but, "As a matter of fact, that triple title
descends perpetually to his successors in office. We can
not see how any other kind of person can properly and
legitimately hold the keys of Presidency in The Church
of Christ. . . ."
Joseph Smith is one prophet who is not without hon
our even in his own Church today. For Morris regards
prognostication under divine guidance as one of the es
sentials of prophecy and he essays to show wherein the
Prophet of the Mormon Church foretold events which
history is fast vindicating. He asks, "Who but God knows
the future?" and answers "Only those to whom He has
revealed it." And he goes on to say that from 1824 to the
day of his unfortunate and untimely death, Joseph Smith
had divine revelation for the enlightenment of mankind.
One of these had to do with the Civil War, and by a
slight stretch of the imagination with the World War.
In 1832 Joseph heard a voice from heaven saying that the
fracas between the North and South would begin in
South Carolina—which wasn't a bad guess, for as Morris
is generous enough to point out, "A state of rebellion ac
tually existed in South Carolina at the very time the
prophecy was made." The breach must have been ob
vious, even in its details, to even a prophet in those days,
for South Carolina was in open rebellion against the
Union and its Senator was pounding Charles Sumner
over the head with a cane in Washington for his un
complimentary remarks. Joseph Smith also prophesied
other amazing details, such as the fact that brother would
be ranged against brother and father against son, which
was just as inevitable as his other prophecy to the effect
that the Southern states would call upon "other nations,
even the nation of Great Britain, as it is called, and they

will call upon other nations in order to defend them
selves against other nations."
This latter statement is taken by Morris to be a refer
ence to the World War, which was followed by flood,
famine, and pestilence, just as the divine seer had fore
warned. There were many other prophecies —among
them the prediction that the Saints would be persecuted,
—a safe enough bet—that many would apostasize, which
was even safer, and that others would be put to death.
Still another was that many of the Saints would die of
exposure and disease, a prophecy which Brigham Young
fulfilled when he started the pilgrims out across the
prairies toward Utah at the beginning of winter, with the
result that almost a third of the original number lost
their lives. Joseph also told Stephen Douglas point blank
that, though his chances to become President were great,
if he ever turned against the Mormons, hell and destruc
tion would befall him. Douglas joined the attack upon
the Saints and another prophecy was fulfilled. As Smith
predicted, Douglas felt "the weight of the hand of God
upon him."
So it goes. I think I have cited enough to show the
astounding veneration in which the founder of the church
is held. He laid the foundations of a great inland em
pire and built a church which this year maintains two
thousand missionaries in the field and recently erected
a six hundred thousand dollar temple in Canada, and
one costing two hundred thousand dollars in Hawaii.
Starting in 1830 with six members and few prospects, it
now has a membership of more than half a million, an
organization dominating an area of over two hundred
thousand square miles, and an income of approximately
four million dollars a year.

Cowdery, who "stood up and prophesied many things
which should shortly come to pass," —which things, as
Snowden points out, Smith discreetly failed to record.
Later, as I have shown, the fuller baptism of heaven,
which conferred upon them the higher priesthood, came
upon the men, and their positions were henceforth above
that of the Pope of Rome, having been bestowed by a
special act of God and not endlessly transferred through
an apostate apostolic succession. The brethren spread the
doctrine, and Smith began having the revelations to
which he was addicted throughout his career. Finally
six members of the community were rounded up and the
church established. Of this church Smith and Cowdery
were the first and second elders, but as the organization
grew, it became more complex, until it flowered into the
involved theocracy which marks the church today. Smith
got his guidance on polity from a series of revelations,
and, as one of the Twelve Apostles of the Church said
recently, "The Church's organic constitution was made
in heaven." David Whitmer in his "Address to Believers
in the Book of Mormon" naively remarks that when
Brother Joseph sought the Lord's mind on any point of
moment, "of course a revelation would come just as they
desired it." In one of these revelations, made in June,
1829, the appointment of Twelve Apostles for the mod
ern apostolic church was ordered and Smith himself was
directed to become Seer, Revelator, and Prophet, with
the understanding that his functions should devolve upon
his successors. The organization which Smith worked out
persists today. It is a glorious hierarchy with authority
centered in "the ruling sultan of the Church." Asso
ciated with him are two counsellors, and the three con
stitute the "first presidency," who are the modern
counterparts of Peter, James, and John. Next in order is
the patriarch, a figurehead who can have visions but not
revelations. This office seems to have been created for the
Smith family, and has never been of more than perfunc
tory importance. Then follows the order of the Twelve
Apostles, the first one of whom has authority equal to the
combined authority of the other eleven. They discharge

the services of the church, administer baptism and com
munion, and are in line for the presidency.
Below the Twelve are the quorums of the seventies.
Snowden explains that these bodies comprise elders di
vided into groups of seventy, of which groups there are
now about one hundred and fifty. Each group of seventy
has seven presidents, and every seven of the seventies has
a president, and all of these presidents constitute a
quorum. The presidents occupy the station of subordinate
apostles and they are the missionaries and propagandists
of the church. Then there are the high priests, who are
really surrogates, and the two orders of priesthood, that
of Aaron and that of Melchizedek. The dignitaries form
the latter, and the former is given over to a concern with
the practical affairs of the church. It is headed by a
bishop, whose function it is to supervise the collection of
tithes.
Few stories in our history are so rich or seamy as the
story of the Mormon conquest of the wilderness. Were it
not for the hardship worked upon the ladies, there would
be ground for thinking that the Saints deserved the pleas
ures of polygamy in reward for their heroism and suffer
ing. Smith and his elders soon found the clime at Pal
myra unfavourable to the growth of the new religion,
there being in that city certain ones who regarded him
and the whole Smith family as a pack of liars and fakirs,
so he dispatched several of the brethren on an expedition
of reconnoitring in the West. These brethren got as
far as Kirtland, Ohio, where they met and overthrew
the masterful Sidney Rigdon, a roaring Campbellite
preacher who held the countryside within the sway of
his pulpit influence. The Gentile theory is of course that
Rigdon knew about the Book of Mormon all along and
that his conversion was a fraud. Whatever the other facts,
this fact is certain : He became an open and aggressive
convert to the cult of Joseph Smith, and within several
months after his capitulation, there were more than a
thousand Mormons in and about Kirtland. The time and

miracles, its real flesh and blood prophet whose name was
Smith but who had none the less seen God face to face
and been commissioned by him to restore the Church
on earth. A study of the period shows that the Kentucky
revival had swept the land several years before, that the
Millerites were soon to come, and that the Shakers were
setting up communities in Ohio at this very time —1829-
183 1. Everything was favourable for the establishment of
a new American frontier religion which would give the
people the same incentive to conquer the wilds as the Is
raelites had many years before. The Mormons have been
known among friends and foes as superb colonizers, and
for the good reason, I believe, that they made a religion of
it. They regarded themselves called of God to go out from
the land of Pharaoh, and to found the walls of Zion in the
great open spaces of the West. Mormonism was the re
ligion of the pioneer. The Saint laboured not because he
wanted merely a home and liberty of conscience, but be
cause he was profoundly convinced that he formed a part
of the chosen people of the earth and that he moved under
the direction of Almighty God just as obviously as did
the children of ancient Israel. The inclusive missionary
work of the church began just here, and the Saints went
"by twos and without purse or script," not only West but
into Canada and back into New England as well, meeting
everywhere with astonishing success. The converts were
bundled up and sent to the New Jerusalem, which Jo
seph Smith decided to establish in Ohio, though he had
a lustful eye upon Missouri.
Opposition got under weigh, for the sect grew in stature
by leagues daily. Alexander Campbell bellowed against
it,

told, a buried treasure of gold was to be found in a va
cant house. "The Safety Society Bank," which floated a
hundred thousand dollars worth of bills "for the accom
modation of the public," refused to redeem the bills, for
that, said Rigdon, would defeat the purpose of the ven
ture. The state law came into operation, Rigdon and
Smith were tried and convicted. Their case was appealed,
but they were out of the state before a final decision was
reached.
All this while the Prophet Joseph Smith was behaving
like an ordinary fellow. He told a convert who had come
from Canada to join his church, "not to bray so much
like a jackass," and his tact in other dealings was of a
similar cut. He was arrested on a charge of having hired
two Mormons to kill a farmer who had been outspoken
in his denunciation of the cult, but he was discharged. He
had also begun his polygamous hankering and prac
tices, according to Linn, though the divine revelation
approving plural wives had not yet been handed down
to him. The suspicion of polygamy was in the air, and
the church issued a pronunciamento saying that they
would not approve that ungodly thing. The statement
was sufficiently strong to indicate that the charges had
been frequent and violent. On the night of March 25,
1832, Smith and Rigdon were disapproved of in a genu
ine American way; they were tarred and feathered by a
band of respectable citizens who held them to be peculiar
and therefore better dispensed with.
By now Kirtland was no better clime for the Church
of Jesus Christ and the Holy City of Zion than Palmyra,
New York. The Saints fell to bickering among them
selves. There were dissensions and charges of gross im
morality, and in January, 1838, Smith and Rigdon, hav
ing made a final stand against the charges brought against
them, left Zion on horseback and never returned.
Joseph Smith had had the feeling that Kirtland might
not be Zion after all. Missouri seemed more likely, and
like Joshua of old, he sent emissaries across to spy out the
land and see that it was good. These returned and, con

mons felt themselves to be re-acting, they described the
land as one "flowing with milk and honey, upon which
there shall be no curse when the Lord cometh." Smith
and a small band of his followers went over into Missouri
as early as 1831, and immediately a revelation showed him
that this was really the Promised Land after all. Emigra
tion from Kirtland was provoked by Smith, and in less
than two years the Mormons numbered more than twelve
hundred in and around Independence, Missouri, and
were one-third of the population of Jackson County. Op
position grew apace, however, and the solid citizens soon
warned the Mormons that they would have to move on.
Smith got a revelation saying "Zion shall not be moved
out of her place," a prophecy which the Mormons still
regard as good, for they intend some day to return to
Independence and erect a gala temple there. But Zion
was moved temporarily, for the attacks upon the Mor
mons continued and they were forced to move into Clay
and other counties to the north. Shortly afterwards
they founded the town of Far West, and it was to this
place that Smith fled when he left Ohio in 1838. Several
of the high authorities of the church were promptly
expelled for their continued opposition to Smith, and
once more a temple was built with great pomp and cere
mony.
Opposition grew, if indeed any room was left for
growth, and a state of virtual civil war prevailed. Gov
ernor Boggs made an ass of himself and martyrs of the
Mormons by assembling four hundred militia men and
declaring that the Mormons "must be exterminated or

In Illinois the disconsolate band of God's people fared
better for a while. They were strong enough to purchase

Jng "a beautiful place." They waxed strong financially
and numerically, strong enough so that they became a
political force, and both contending parties in the state
capital sought to please them. The result was that the
city of Nauvoo was given a special charter which guaran
teed it privileges tantamount to those of a separate com
munity, providing even for an army of militia under the
command of Joseph Smith to protect the peace of the
place and to be used as General Smith saw fit. This time
the spire rose to a height of a hundred and sixty feet and
the whole building cost more than a million dollars. A
timely revelation showed that Zion had been moved from
Jackson County, Missouri, to Nauvoo. This stately edi
fice disappeared entirely with the Mormons, and the
place is now marked by a small town of scarcely thirteen
hundred inhabitants, boasting only two modern build
ings. For a while, however, it was entirely prosperous.
Smith, flushed with fresh victories, decided to run for
President of the United States, having tried in vain to
get both candidates at the time to commit themselves to
Mormon favouritism. An editorial announcing Smith's
candicacy appeared in Times and Seasons, and imme
diately earnest Saints went east and west and north and
south to stir the political waters. It is claimed that as
many as three thousand speakers were put into the field
and these were diligently dividing the Word when Jo
seph Smith met his Golgotha. The trouble was precipi
tated when Smith's lackeys, at his command, destroyed
the office of the Nauvoo Expositor, a paper which had
been launched to show the horrors of Mormon rule and
practice. Smith was arrested, and again released, where
upon he issued a blood and thunder proclamation against
the enemies of Zion. This had little effect save that of
troubling already seething waters. Within a short time a
public meeting was held down the river and a war of
extermination declared against the Mormons. Governor
Ford promised to protect Smith and his associates if they
would surrender. With his brother Hyrum and John
Taylor, Smith gave himself over to the protection of the
state. The Carthage Greys, a body of citizens especially

hostile to the Mormons were selected, either through
stupidity or foresight, as guards. On the morning of June
17, 1844, members of this body forced their way up the
stairs to the room in which the prisoners were confined,
and began firing. Hyrum was killed at once. Taylor was
wounded. Joseph Smith was struck as he leaped from a
window, crying eloquently, "O Lord, my God."
That was the end of Zion in Illinois. The Smith Broth
ers were buried with solemn pomp from the Temple al
tar, though tradition has it that their bodies were not in
the coffins which were carried to the graves but had really
been buried the night before and that they now repose
in unmarked graves along the Mississippi.
Upon the scene just here stalks the man who made
Mormonism what it is. Brigham Young was a Methodist
before he became a Mormon. He came, like Smith, from
the native state of Calvin Coolidge. He was unschooled
in youth, a jack-of-all-trades, and he cast his lot with
Smith while the Saints tarried at Kirtland, Ohio. He kept
quietly in the background from the time of his baptism
up to the time of the tragedy at Nauvoo. At that time
he was off campaigning for Smith in New Hampshire.
Quickly he returned to headquarters, and with the giant
wisdom that he showed on most occasions, kept the mat
ter of Joseph Smith's successor appropriately unsettled
until he could himself gain the ascendancy. Rigdon as
serted his claims, but Young had him expelled from the
church for his pains. He went without muttering, at
tempted to found a church of his own, which, like most
of the Mormon sects, failed utterly, and died without
further saintly activities. Whatever he knew about the
Book of Mormon, which, it is alleged, he contrived with
Smith, he never told.
Meanwhile Young managed the church as head of the
Twelve Apostles until 1847, when he was chosen Presi
dent. William Smith, brother of Joseph and Hyrum, put
in his claims, but they were passed unnoticed. He paid
his respects to Brigham Young as the greatest tyrant since
the days of Nero, and laid the foundation for the only
successful apostasy ever accomplished against the Mor

mons. It was not until i860, however, that Joseph Smith,
son of the Prophet, was ordained as the true successor to
his father; here there sprang into being the Reorganized
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, a body
which has come to be known as the Josephites. They stood
always against polygamy and Brigham Young and have
shown those same qualities of aggression and enterprise
that have characterized all Mormon activity. The Jo
sephites now number a hundred thousand members and
have two hundred missionaries in the field. In fact, they
have invaded Utah, where they claim a thousand ad
herents.
But the brayings of discord never for one moment
fazed Brigham Young. Already the state of Illinois had
warned the Saints that they must go. By the early part of
1846 the greater part of the Mormons had made their
way across the Mississippi and established the Camp of
Israel on Sugar Creek in Iowa. Here began their actual
exodus, their supreme venture of faith, and here the feel
ing that they were the children of God and the modern
counterparts of Abraham and Moses served them in best
stead. The Middle West was Egypt to them. Nothing re
mained but to head for the uncertain land beyond the
Rockies. They started, "they knew not whither."
Brigham Young had at this time his first and only
revelation. It was characteristic. It offered none of the
sanctimonious poppycock with which Smith had doc
tored all of his. It had to do with practical items and it
descended into Scriptural anachronisms only for a mo
ment at the close. The scheme was this: Some of the
Saints were to go in advance and prepare fields of grain
and habitations for those who were yet to come. Four
months after it was issued the whole body had reached
the Missouri River and established a temporary village
near the site of what is now Omaha. All the while, for
months afterwards, stragglers, comprising converts from
the East and from Europe, kept arriving at the place
established.
From this point a pioneering expedition under Brig
ham Young set out for the Rockies. By the first of June

they were more than five hundred miles from the starting
point and over five hundred miles from the Great Salt
Lake. Here if ever was demonstrated the final persever
ance of the Saints, for in July they came suddenly upon
a broad and fertile valley, at the end of which glistened
the waters of the Great Salt Lake. There could be no
doubt that God had put that lake there for this very mo
ment: "The Land of Promise —held in reserve by the
hand of God for the resting place of his Saints."
At the risk of tedium I must emphasize the religious
motive which spurred this conquest of the Rockies. These
men were more than pioneers; they were apostles to
whom God had promised earthly as well as heavenly
reward. They began their journey with divine assur
ance, they completed it with divine vindication. They
were the chosen people of the modern world, led out of
the wilderness by a doppelganger of Moses, and into a
land as rich and bountiful as Canaan ever dared to be.
Repeated streams of emigration followed hard upon
the heels of the explorers until within a few years more
than three thousand Saints were gathered in the Western
Zion. Only one disaster marred the glory of the enter
prise. That was the hand-cart expedition which so abun
dantly fulfilled the prophecy of Father Joseph that
"many should die of exposure." Brigham Young, staunch
executive that he was, wanted very much to speed up
production and curtail the operating expenses. He con
cluded in 1855 that the heavy wagons and other items of
equipment were quite needless and that a light hand-cart
could be used just as effectively to transport the Lord's
people. Accordingly he issued a proclamation to Elder
Richards in Liverpool that the next expedition should
foot it and haul its baggage in the carts.
The results of that expedition only serve to show what
colossal mistakes those who can build empires sometimes
make. To begin with, the carts were not ready when the
thirteen hundred immigrants arrived at Iowa City to be
gin the trek of eleven hundred miles across the plains.
Here was delay, and a winter was coming on. The carts
were equipped for carrying only the lightest loads. Five

companies started, some as late as July and August. In
the face of the divine edict Elder Levi Savage warned
these companies that they would never make it. He was
properly rebuked for lack of faith and the companies
began the trek.
Soon the sick and aged began to fall by the wayside.
The carts broke down and were constantly in need of re
pair. Sickness spread rapidly among the ranks, and to
aggravate it all, winter caught the Saints in the moun
tains. The scenes that followed are terrible even to re
member. John Chislett, a member of the expedition, has
written a superb and graphic account of it all in Sten-
house's Rocky Mountain Saints. The whole of it was
tragical in a terrifying Russian way, and all because, as
Chislett says, the people's greatest "sin was believing
with a faith too simple that God would for their benefit
reverse the order of nature." Of the company of six hun
dred of which he was a member, over one fourth were
frozen to death. Other companies suffered proportionate
losses and it was a bedraggled and pathetic crowd of
Saints who staggered into Zion.
But already stone upon stone the foundations of the
gigantic Mormon empire had been placed, and reverses
could not destroy the foundations so ably laid. The peo
ple of the Lord flourished, even as the ancient Jews had
promised that they would flourish. Wealth and influence
accumulated and within a quarter of a century the whole
of the territory of Utah was under saintly domination.
Only the efforts of the federal Government to stop polyg
amy in the latter part of the Nineteenth Century taught
the American people the extent and depth of the grasp
which the Latter-Day Saints had upon the commonwealth
of which they were a part. From that time on they be
gan to be referred to as a national abscess which ought
to be removed from the body politic.

their faces steadfastly against its practice. There
is,
how
ever, what may roughly be called evidence to show that
Joseph fell into the practice of
it
out of pure love of
woman-flesh in the early days of his Prophetic incarna
tion, and
it
was not surprising that he received
a
reve
lation condoning, nay, enjoining the practice, in 1843.
This revelation did not become
a
part of the official creed
of the church until 1852, when
it
was announced at Salt
Lake City, and
it
has since remained an undeleted sec
tion of the amazing creed of the American Mohamme
dans. Once begun, the saints took to the new require
ment with
a
vengeance. It was
a
source of spiritual bless
ing which they did not propose to leave untapped.
It
grew of course, from the practices of the Old Testament
and was but
a
logical extension of the favourite Mormon
idea that the Latter Day Saints were the modern repre
sentatives of the Lord;
it
only pressed the analogy with
the children of Israel just
a
bit further than
it
was pushed
when they set forth to find the Land of Promise in the
Western part of the United States. It
is
very definitely
tied up, too, with the Mormon belief in the other world
—that
a
man's relations go on to the glory land and that
women need to have some men on the golden streets to
care for them. It insured an abundant progeny and, by
a
logical bit of thinking, insured that many more in
habitants in heaven.
The extent of its practice
is
a
matter which cannot be
discussed without the introduction of documents which
the space for this epitome does not allow. Writing in
1857, however, Elder John Hyde describes Salt Lake
City in such
a
manner as the following, "Wilford Wood
ruff and five wives reside in another large house still
further West," and so on. There
is
one delightful ac
count written by the apostate wife of Brigham Young,
published under the modest and abnegating title, Wife
No. IQ. She declared that the marriage of mother and
daughter to the same man was so common as not to be
commented upon, and that she had often heard little girls
talk of growing up and "marrying Papa." She further
affirms that the leaders encouraged the ladies to withdraw

from the eligibility lists as soon as they grew unattractive
but allowed the saints to philander up to the age of one
hundred. Brigham married her after she was divorced
from another man, and, so she says, simply because he
wanted to show her that his will was stronger. She re
mained in the clutches of the villain for several years,
until he shipped her to a farm and she deserted both him
and the faith and spent the rest of her life lecturing on
the evils of polygamy.
In 1
870 a giant debate on the Biblical sanction of polyg
amy was held in the Temple at Salt Lake City, with
Professor Orson Pratt, one of the Twelve Apostles,
chosen by Brigham Young as the spokesman of the Mor
mon practice and the Reverend Dr. John P. Newman,
chaplain of the United States Senate, opposing the doc
trine and practice. The whole affair was based on the
Bible. The debate arose when Dr. Newman preached a
sermon in Washington declaring that the Bible taught
monogamy. He was challenged. Skirmishes ensued and
the debate was arranged. It lasted three days, with each
speaker allotted an hour a day.
Pratt, true to Mormon form, began by showing that
the Israelites practised polygamy. He went rapidly on
to modern conditions, showing that the resumption of
Biblical practice was calculated to put brothels out of
business: "For who does not know that females as a gen
eral thing would rather be married than prostitute them
selves as they do at the present time?—and they would
lie in wait in order that they might entrap this man and
that man and the other man for the purpose of being
married to get out of those brothels."
But the government refused to see the blessings of the
system of the pertinence of Biblical arguments. Once the
people were free of preoccupation with the Civil War,
they began to look about for other national concerns, and
with eagerness saw the menace of Mormon polygamy, a
blight upon the fair name of the land to be removed at
all costs. Presidents Garfield, Arthur, and Cleveland pro
nounced against the system, and Arthur signed the first
effective bill against
it,
in 1881. It provided that Mor

mons who had plural wives should not be allowed to act
as jurors, and seemed, at the time, to sew the situation up.
This law was strengthened in 1887, and the very ex
istence of Mormon integrity threatened. Whereupon the
leaders of the cult denounced it roundly and the members
of the flock saw little need to obey its rigid provisions. As
it stood the Edmunds law practically disenfranchised any
man who had two wives. This the Mormons regarded as
persecution of the most bitter sort, and in 1885 the First
Presidency issued a proclamation saying, in•small part:
Upward of forty years ago the Lord revealed to his church the
principle of celestial marriage. . . . Who would suppose that any
man in this land of religious liberty would presume to say to his fellow-
man that he had no right to take such steps as he thought necessary
to escape damnation?
The Utah Territorial Commission began its work in
1882, and within two years more than twelve thousand
Mormons had been disenfranchised.
The result was that in 1889 the non-Mormons put over
a candidate for Mayor, electing him by a majority of
forty-one, and putting the words Mene, Tekel, Upharsin
on the walls for Mormonism. In 1890 the Supreme Court
of the United States affirmed the decision of a lower court
confiscating the entire property of the Mormon Church
and declaring that church to be organized rebellion. The
Mormons saw that the time for concession was at hand.
President Wilford W. Woodruff, eighty-three years
old at the time, issued the manifesto against the practice in
1890. He had seen his share of women in his day, but he
promised that it was his intention to abide by the laws of
the land in the future, and he called upon his brother
Saints to do likewise. This manifesto was affirmed by the
General Conference of the Church in 1891. Thirteen
months later Woodruff explained to the world that the
step had been taken because Jesus Christ laid it upon his
heart and the heart of his brethren. Amnesty was granted
by President Harrison and the property of the Church re
stored.
Whether the laws of the land were obeyed is doubtful.

his book, Lights and Shadows of Mormonism, that John
W. Taylor and Abraham H. Cannon married plural
wives after the amnesty proclamation, and supplies the
proof. The same charge was made and proven before the
Senate committee investigating the eligibility of Apostle
Reed Smoot. And in 1906 a majority of the committee
of the Senate reported that the Apostle Smoot was not
entitled to a seat because he was one of the body high in
church circles who favoured a continuation of polygamy.
The facts remain that the celestial marriage arrange
ment still is written in the laws of the church and that, if
it is obeyed, it is out of expediency. For the Mormons
helieve in its divine authenticity as firmly as the Metho
dists believe in the witness of the Spirit, or the Dukhobors
in no marriage whatsoever. Everywhere among the Mor
mons prevails the most credulous and naive acceptance
of the revelations of Joseph Smith.
So far as I am able to determine, the Saints still wear
their long, peculiar drawers as a part of the faith. Wife
No. 19 was promised that she should be a celestial queen
and should receive the Endowments of the order. She
tells of having been led into a bathroom, where she was
abluted and then anointed from head to foot with olive
oil. She was next given the sacred drawers, "like a child's
sleeping-robe, with waist and drawers combined." It
reaches from the neck to the feet and is of white, bleached
muslin, and "untrimmed." Everyone who has received the
Endowments, a peculiar series of ceremonies initiating
the Mormons into the inner mysteries, wears this. Wife
No. 19 was charged never to remove
it,
and
it
is
said
that Smith would never have been shot
if
he had not
neglected to don his holy underwear the morning of his
arrest. Those who receive their Endowments are buried
in the paraphernalia of the inner cult—cotton drawers,
white shoes and stockings, and the fig-leaf apron which
the neophytes put on as
a
part of the initiation ceremony.
As
I
have once indicated, the practice of polygamy
is
definitely tied up with the belief in the after world. Har-

is the proper marital condition. Plural marriage, they
say
. . . found its justification in the possibility it afforded for a large
posterity which would contribute to eternal joy. Making marriage
eternal has greatly added to the race's chastity. ... It has likewise
materially lowered the divorce-rate and heightened the birth-rate.
Along with the Thedsophists and Swedenborgians, the
Mormons believe in eternal progression beyond the
grave. In a sermon delivered in 1844, Joseph Smith de
clared : "God Himself was once as we are now, and is an
exalted Man and sits enthroned yonder in the Heavens."
The author of Joseph Smith the Scientist quotes this state
ment of the Prophet: "Man is to develop until, in com
parison with his present condition, he becomes a God."
There are planes to the Mormon heaven. The Celestial
Kingdom is reserved for the really blessed and exalted.
Those who have died in ignorance of the true gospel and
those who are merely honourable by the codes of man
go to the Terrestial Kingdom. The Telestial Kingdom
is where the unbelievers go and remain with the devil
until the last resurrection. Far below is the old-time hell,
reserved for the sons of perdition who have stiffened their
necks and remained in sin.
It is a cardinal tenet of Mormon theology that the liv
ing can be baptized for the dead. Apostle Talmadge tells
us that the gospel is being preached in the spirit world
today and that the living must submit to the ordinances
on behalf of those who have passed on. Joseph Smith
solemnly affirmed that Elijah the prophet of ancient
Israel appeared in the Temple erected by the Saints at
Kirtland, Ohio, and effected the fulfilment of Malachi's
predictions, giving to the Saints the injunction that they
save those in the spiritual world who have gone on be
fore without the blessings of the true faith.

Church and today two thousand are kept in the field,
"without purse or script," though of course the Saints
live off of converts and prospects and other members of
the body. As early as 1837 missionaries were sent to Eng
land. In 1840 Orson Hyde was sent on a special mission to
the Jews in London, Amsterdam, Constantinople, and
Jerusalem. And the same year, says Stenhouse, "mission
aries were sent to Australia, Wales, Ireland, the Isle of
Man, and the East Indies." By i860 they were scattered
all over the world from the Cape of Good Hope to Ice
land. By 1
85 1 there were reported to be over fifty thou
sand converts in England, some seventeen thousand of
which had emigrated to Zion.
Whatever else may be said of
it,
Mormonism has
shown vitality. It has demonstrated that
a
religion can
flourish evangelically and financially without historical
truth of any sort beneath it. It
is
only necessary that the
people believe in what
is
alleged to have happened. The
Mormons do. It
is
not the facts of their origin viewed
objectively that accounts for their astonishing growth,
but rather the fact that the Saints believe in these facts.
They have grown with the land. They were born in
a
re
vival, they were led of God across new frontiers, they
prospered and amassed wealth, and they are now faced
with that perplexity which faces all religious bodies:
How shall youth be led to see the divine glory of the
old system? And the answer probably
is
that they won't.

THE MAID OF ANGELUS
Mrs. AlMEE Semple McPherson has had more than
her share of publicity as a vaudevillian. But the good
lady's charms and capers have so consumed the attention
of our writers that her mysterious labours have some
how escaped us. It is for the very reason that Sister her
self has been the centre of attraction that I wish in brief
to sketch the cult she has established and point to its sim
ilarities to other cults at present functioning in the
democracy. After all, she is not an individual, however
winsome and striking she may be on parade. She is a
goddess in the eyes of her followers, and their number is
legion. She is the executive of a vast and enormously suc
cessful enterprise, the geometric centre of a theophany.
Those loyal zealots who make up the horde of her pa
trons care only in a most incidental way, I fancy, for her
ankles and for her devilish ways. There are other senti
ments to the fore in their loyalties. We must deliver our
selves of the feeling that the woman's radiance and charm
are the essentials of her success; her charm is but an
other token of her priesthood —and it is not a thing to be
considered sensually or practically as so many column
ists are likely to consider it. Those who gape lovingly at
her as she emerges from the inner sanctuary and takes
her place within a shrine of flowers as the holy service
opens are doubtless moved by the figure and grace of the
woman, but unconsciously. The emotions they feel are
those commonly associated with the loftiest realm of the
spirit. She offers not merely a spectacle but a religious
spectacle ; she is not merely a performer but a performer

Let the financial element be forgotten for a moment. It

the property of the order is an effect and not a cause.

an oracle of health and happiness. She is all these before
she is a financier, and if it were not for her ability to
traffic in religion and if she did not understand the basic
elements which make up religious behaviour, she would
be at best a moderately well off real estate agent in the
Middle West, with little more than a comfortable home
for her widowed mother.
We Americans, particularly if we live in villages or
have moved from villages to cities, are quick to herald a
new messiah. We have a mania for incarnations. We must
coagulate about some prophet and make him the object
of our adoration and loyalty. We are for ever on the look
out for something tangible. If we look intimately at the
work which Sister does or if we but inspect the scene in
and around the Church of J. Frank Norris in Fort
[Worth, Texas, we find operating there all the primitive
elements which make the religion of mankind. Both of
these Churches —the Angelus Temple in Los Angeles
and the First Baptist Church of Fort Worth—are re
ligions in miniature, comprising every component to be
found on a large scale in any of the world religions.
Norris came out of the sticks of Texas not a great many
years ago, found that the church to which he had been
assigned was, not unlike a great many others in the
vicinity, moribund. There followed certain sensational
events—among them the burning of his church and the
mysterious bullet fired through the window of his study.
He was tried for arson. Now the work of the Lord was
gloriously on foot. The sleepy cow-town was waked up by
the rumpus in court. People began to flock to his serv

ices, and it was not many months before he exercised an
influence which made many of his fellow Protestant
clergymen regard him as a menace. He fell out with his
denominational headquarters. Evolution came along, and
evolution has made many a great preacher. Then fol
lowed the menace of Catholicism. By now Norris had
become a fighter of the first water. A row arose over some
Catholic property; the pastor charged the Mayor with
graft and conspiracy with the Pope; a friend resented the
charge; circumstances developed; D. E. Chipps, the
friend, called upon the pastor and was killed in his study.
Norris a few months later was freed on the ground of
self-defence.
And that, by the way, is the ground upon which he has
always been freed and upon which he has always suc
ceeded. He was a man whose mind was sufficiently far
above that of his followers to inspire respect but not envy.
He believed as they did and became the aegis of their
ideas. He identified himself with their causes, became the
champion of their attitudes, and so cleverly insinuated
himself into their affections and emotions that they took
any attack upon their sacred beliefs to be an attack upon
him. The members of the circle learned to regard him
as the blood and flesh of the high principle anti-Catholi
cism, of White Supremacy, of literal and reverent scrip
tural interpretation. Obviously, then, he has become
more than the common mangy pastor of the Texas
prairies. His band has stood as solidly for him in the
midst of litigation and scandal as the devotees of Ange-
lus. He knows the religious value of paranoia and he
turns events into persecutions as quickly as the followers
of Pastor Russell. The lamented Chipps of course came
as the arch tool of a conspiracy to murder him. The local
authorities are leagued against him, and consequently
against righteousness, when on behalf of iniquity they
prosecute him for arson and perjury or indict him for
murder. To all practical appearances and as far as the
human side of religious behaviour is concerned, J. Frank
Norris is the god of his tribe, the centre of its affections,
the object of its loyalties, and the totem of its beliefs. His

cult is one of those local phenomena that are common in
America, and the only thing extraordinary about it is the
sharpness of its lines. We witness within the regular
borders of the orthodox church the coagulation of a
group of zealous followers about a single person whose
doctrines are not distinct but simply harsher than those of
fellow priests; we find these zealous followers ready at
a moment's notice to follow their leader if a rupture
comes between headquarters and the local body; we dis
cover that the devotion of the people grows more and
more unwavering and that the sect takes on features of
distinction until it has developed what is in the end a new
cultus. It is the story of Menno, of Mother Ann Lee,
of Wesley, of Jacob Amman, of F. N. D. Buchman, of
Aimee Semple McPherson.
II
What Doctor Norris has done in a state Aimee Semple
McPherson is fast doing in a nation. She has performed
on that lavish scale and with the regal ado which counts
for everything in this land of silk and money. It can
hardly be gainsaid that she possesses a more elaborate
sense of the dramatic; but what is of greater importance,
she has a keener sense of the religious. She was born in
the Canadian wilds and lived on a small farm there un
til the time of her conversion at the age of seventeen. She
lost her faith early in life through the irreverence of the
chemistry teacher in the local high school, who made
certain snooty remarks about Genesis. She got it back
through one Robert Semple, who appeared in her native
village to hold a Full Gospel Revival at the time when
she felt herself in direst straits. She describes herself as
swept completely into the fold by the earnest, rugged, un
compromising gospel which Semple preached. Her con
version at his hands was apparently sound for she went
straight home and swept all the ragtime music off the
piano and said it would be the Bible and the hymn book
for her from then on. And it was.

neighbour to sit up with sick children. As the weary hours
of the night wore on, who should come to that house but
Robert Semple! He had been holding another meeting
in the vicinity and explained his presence merely by say
ing that he had heard the children were ill and dropped
in to see about them. As they sat together, Aimee thanked
him for the letters of encouragement in faith he had writ
ten her, showed him as best she could what inspiration
they had been, and told him proudly that she looked up
every scripture reference for the triumph over sin that
he had sent her. The conversation moved on until Robert
Semple found it in his heart to tell her he had been
called to carry the Gospel to idol-ridden China. There
was a map in the room. They arose and looked at it to
gether while the evangelist pointed out Hong Kong. She
told him then how she longed to be a winner of souls and
that nothing would please her more than to have some
part in taking the Gospel to China. "No, I wasn't hint
ing," she explains in her autobiography. But whether
she was or not, Robert Semple was willing. He asked her
to go and refused to take her answer until the two had
knelt together and asked God's will in the matter. As
they prayed she felt her hand imprisoned in his, and a
few months later they sailed for China.
There her first husband died, and a while later their
child was born. She returned to America, lost and lonely
without the man she loved. Within a few years she had
married again, this time to a New England wholesale
groceryman. They married with the understanding that,
in the event she ever felt moved to take up religious work
again, she should have her freedom. It was not long un
til she felt so moved. Mr. McPherson went with her for
a while, then turned back into the world of business.
"But as for my call," she says, "there was no going back.
I found truly, as that servant of old, 'Woe is me if I fail
to preach the gospel.'

of the active work her health began to fail. She suffered
a complete nervous and physical breakdown. Insistently
the call of the Lord came to her as she hovered between
life and death, and finally she answered in the death
chamber, "Yes, Lord, I'll go." When she returned to the
work her health was restored —yea, even upon her de
cision to return, and she declares that she has never been
sick a day since that moment of wondrous decision, even
though her schedule of work at Angelus makes the man-
killing job of the Presidency seem recreational.
When she said, "Yes, Lord, I'll go," she meant it. She
went first to the mourner's bench and got religion in one
of those doses which only a woman of her physique and
temperament can stand. This took place in a little village
called Berlin before the War and Kitchener after it. As
soon as the light came she began work. She turned to the
brother on her right and prayed that he too might re
ceive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Then she offered the
evangelist her services. He was a bit timid about taking
them and she landed in the tent where dishes were
washed, there gladly performing menial service for the
King.
That was only the beginning. A while later she was
given a chance to paint a sign announcing the revival,
and this act is significantly her first great step in the serv
ice. She made that sign an item which the villagers talk
about to this day. Not long after that she decided to enter
the work on her own. She went to help a local pastor with
a meeting but the crowds which turned out were negligi
ble. That would never do. She had to have a crowd, and
she got it. She took a chair and carried it down to the
main corner on the main street. She climbed up on it
and started to pray, largely because she didn't know any
thing else to do. (There has always been this na'ive mix
ture of religious purpose and canny method in her work.)
As she tells the incident in her book there is the follow
ing touch that lends verisimilitude to the story as a whole :

"What's the matter with her?"
"Dunno."
"What ya reckon it is?"
"Maybe a cataleptic state."
"What kind of a state?"
"Cataleptic; sorta unconscious-like."
"Think so?"
"Sure."
She continued to pray, though she heard enough of
what went on about her to record the above conversation
with convincing reality years later. As soon as she heard
enough folks milling around her chair, she jumped down,
took the chair, and crying "Quick! Quick! Come with
me!" fairly flew up the street, with the crowd at her heels.
"From that day to this," she says, "I have always
preached to crowds." 2
At the end of the first week's service she was reminded
by the pastor that she had taken no collection ; and with
timidity and reluctance she gave the folks a chance to
contribute to the work of the Lord. That was her method
and it worked as well then as it does today, when she
stands in her pulpit with fifty thousand dollars to raise
and says, "Now, I'll let only ten of God's children give
me a thousand dollars each"; and there is always a
scramble and a deal of good-natured rivalry to deter
mine which are the first ten to have their hands in the
air. That first night she got sixty-five dollars. She sat up
most of the night watching
it,
she says, and the next day
she bought
a
tent with it. That tent turned out to be moth-
eaten, but
it
gave the opportunity for her first miracle.
It threatened one day to rip and the next day
it
did rip.
The whole canvas started to cave. Not knowing what
else to do, Mrs. McPherson cried out: "In the name of

or not, that tent caught on

always where she believed the Lord was leading. She
gives us one incident to show the manner in which she
was led.
In this particular instance, while in prayer the word "Corona" kept
recurring to my mind.
As a contributor to several religious magazines, I had been praying
for a Corona typewriter and my first thought was that this was the
reason. However, in a few days came the shrill whistle of the postman
and the missive that he bore ran:
Dear Sister McPherson:
Come at once to Corona, Long Island. Revival clouds are ready to
burst on our heads. The Lord hath need of thee."
She didn't know the woman who signed it but the letter
bore the hallmark of divine command and the next move
she made was to Corona, Long Island. She looked up the
address of the one who had summoned her and found
there a negro mammy who thought that in view of the
sin in Corona and surrounding points, it was 'bout time
for a special blessing. No preparations of any sort had
been made, but Providence would have its way for her
and it was not long until she had pitched the community
into the throes of a monstrous upheaval emanating from
the Swedish Methodist Church.
The winter was coming on and she felt the call of the
Lord to go to Florida for a series of tent meetings. There
her success increased and soon she abounded in the knowl
edge that her work should not be confined to any single
sphere or hemisphere. Her healing labours grew apace,
and in Florida she healed a man with a broken arm, to
the great delight of his wife and to the consternation of a
scoffing infidel who warned the man of the McPherson
method. This infidel was the apostate son of a Methodist
minister and before the evangelist left town she had the
pleasure of wiring the father that the prodigal had re
turned. Her fame grew by leaps and bounds, and the time
seemed propitious to move upon California, a state that
has always offered abnormal religionists the promise of
Canaan. Now occurred a significant and prophetic inci
dent. Her daughter fell ill, and it was only by much wres

the life of her own child. But she succeeded, and in her
attempt to encourage little Roberta, she promised her a
bungalow in California. She simply felt moved to make
the promise, and it was not in vain, for later she fulfilled
it and threw in a cathedral and a mansion to boot. Little
Roberta is now pastor of the junior congregation of An-
gelus Temple, a congregation that numbers between four
teen and fifteen hundred members at the last church
census, though doubtless a few hundred others have been
added since.
Ill
All of this time the lot upon which the Temple now
stands was covered with weeds and tin cans, and no pa
per in Los Angeles had ever carried a line about Aimee
Semple McPherson. Four years after she landed in that
city she had established a congregation of fifteen thou
sand, built an edifice seating fifty-three hundred, started
on its world-redeeming way a Bible Institute housed in a
six-story building, and set up branches of the parent
Temple throughout the land.
Did she do it through financial shrewdness? She can-
nily understands and earnestly takes active part in re
ligious hullabaloos because she believes in them and en
joys them. She is a woman whose mind roves in religious
orbits and whose emotions find chief solace in a con
spicuously religious atmosphere. Perhaps she is not with
out guile and possibly she has an eye to the material, but
I can see no grounds for the absurd statement made by
a great many intelligent writers that she is not religious.
If not, then neither was Mohammed. I have heard her
proclaim the gospel and I solemnly testify that I have
never beheld one more painfully bent upon the salvation
of souls than the woman who pounded the Holy Book
upon the pulpit before her and shouted with priestly
hoarseness that she believed it from cover to cover. She is
severely religious, and whatever she has done has been
through the instrumentality of organized and buoyant re
ligion.

THE MAID OF ANGELUS 403
It was when she reached Los Angeles that she began
to hear the commission to build a house unto the Lord.
"It was while meditating," she explains, "upon the
strange manner of my having been so strongly impressed
to come to California . . . that I began to realize that
there was a far greater plan back of it all than a bunga
low for the babies and that it was the will of the Mas
ter that I build a house unto the Lord." She goes on:
I felt the call to build a Temple of Prayer, but was perplexed as to
how far to proceed, until one day, while driving about the city, I came
upon a spot —a little paradise in itself —which was then quite a dis
tance from the business district.
Immediately the structure rose in her mind. She caught
a vision of thousands coming in from all directions, of
automobiles parked for miles, of rich and poor with
Bibles beneath their arms pouring into the temple of the
Lord. Once started, her thoughts ran riot.
Going over to the "For Sale" sign posted on the ground, upon which
was drawn the shape and dimensions of the lot, I sat down and began
to sketch my plans for the temple. The building should be circular in
front with a score of crystal glass doors. The interior, with the main
floor and two balconies, should be shaped like a great piece of pie with
seven aisles in the main floor and every aisle and rampart leading to
the altar.4
The walls were to be wonderfully tinted and punc
tured here and there by lurid pictures taken from the life
of Jesus; the dome would be a blue, star-studded sky.
And it all turned out just that way. Angelus Temple
boasts the largest fire-proof auditorium in the world and
its grandeur is the subject of comment upon the lips of
everyone who has had the high privilege of entering it.
It arose in a vision; it swam before the eyes of a woman
who had been commissioned to build a house of prayer
unto the Lord.
She had not the money at that time, she avers. So there
began again that wide and sweeping tour of the conti
nent; activities were even extended over into Australia,
which, by the way, has always been a rich field for evan

gelistic endeavour. She took what was given as a love
offering and added to this amount the direct gifts of
those who had heard of the project. The speed and di
mensions of her success need not be recorded here. Suf
fice it to say that she wrought the whole astounding mod
ern miracle in less time than it took to build the Sherry-
Netherland and four years after her first peep at the
Pacific she was inaccessibly enshrined in a Temple which
has since become the secret envy of every itinerant
evangelist.
Of the relation she bore that Temple she never left
anyone in doubt—least of all her mother, Mrs. Minnie
Kennedy. When during the recent squabble with that lady
Sister returned post-haste from Alton, Pennsylvania, she
issued this ukase: "Like the captain of a ship or the Presi
dent of the United States, I am pastor and President of
Angelus Temple, and as such am going to control my
congregation. I have come back to take the helm." 5
In the account she gives of her singular achievements
there is never a mention of anyone save herself and the
Lord. Yet the account never reads like that of an ego
maniac; it is rather the naive and straightforward story
of a prophet who wrought and does not regard that fact
as any marvel. She tells it all with the simplicity born of
a crusader's faith.
As for her thousands of devotees, their loyalty is un
failing. She has brought rich and poor together in the
fellowship of religion that answers daily and nightly
needs. Rich folk, Mrs. McPherson tells us, want to be
on the level that all must reach before God. The result
was that when the temple was first opened, "they all
donned the simple white uniform of the Temple, the
plain cotton gown that can be bought for three or four
dollars, left their limousines a block away, and walked to
the Temple that they might in appearance be one with
the joyous multitude."
One has only to read the accounts of their solidarity
during the recent kidnapping crisis to understand the sa
cred manner in which she is regarded. The story of her

kidnapping is familiar. She had been leading a hectic life
of service and sought occasional surcease from it in the
waters of the Pacific. She reports that it was not un
common for another car to overtake hers while she was
out driving and for her to be rushed to some needy per
son. She was always acceding to these demands, though
she had been repeatedly warned, in view of her frequent
attacks upon the underworld, that it might some day lead
to disaster. On May 18, 1926, she rushed to Venice, a
beach suburb of Los Angeles, for a dip. Her secretary
accompanied her, and Aimee took her Bible along to
prepare several sermons before she walked into the water.
While in for a swim her secretary went to a near-by
hotel to telephone and Sister McPherson saw two men
and a woman standing on the beach signalling to her.
Upon hearing that the woman's baby was seriously ill she
went with them to a car, and, as she later charged, was
whisked away by the three of them and held until her
miraculous escape somewhere over the border of Mexico.
When her secretary returned, Sister was nowhere to be
seen and the report was circulated that she was drowned.
For more than a month she was missing and a memorial
fund of twenty-five thousand dollars was raised by the
initiates of Angelus. Then one day came an anonymous
letter to her mother, saying that she was alive and ask
ing for a ransom of half a million dollars. The Post Office
records show, according to the New York Times of July
8th, that the ransom letter was delivered to Mrs. Kennedy
before the memorial service was held.
On June 24th, the evangelist herself turned up in Agua
Prieta, just across the border of Mexico, after having
walked twenty miles from the hut of her kidnappers. The
vivid account which she gives in her autobiography of
her torturous and joyous return to the land of law and
order would repay anyone's reading. Here it can only be
said that she approached first a slaughter house and that
she was directed on into the town, where she fell into a
swoon upon a doorstep. She failed later to find this house
where first she reached friends, though she made a thor
ough search for it before leaving Douglas. Arizona. She

failed also to find the hut in which she had been held so
long and ended up by offering a five hundred dollar re
ward for its discovery.
Thanks to a dull season of the year and the growing
interest in stories with both religious and sex appeal, she
became a nationally known figure. After a period of re
cuperation, Sister was taken back to Los Angeles on a
special train. There she was greeted by what the Los
Angeles Examiner describes as "a riot of frantic cheer
ing, of shrieking automobile sirens, of factory whistles.
. . . Presidents have travelled across the country and
found along the way a lesser demonstration." Often her
train was halted en route to Los Angeles at wayside junc
tions, and admirers, many times in the wee hours of the
night, would crowd around for one glimpse of the god
dess. Once off the train, she was surrounded by a milling
crowd of thousands, and she trod upon a carpet of roses.
When she appeared first at Angelus Temple she told of
her trials to seventy-five hundred listeners. The place was
packed, and her story was emptied into the overflow
quarters by means of loud speakers.
Then she was brought to court. The authorities had
certain questions which they wished to clear up in con
nexion with her alleged abduction. Five witnesses pointed
her out as the woman they had seen at Carmel-by-the-Sea
with a man identified as Ormiston, her radio operator.
To her followers that trial was nothing but another
ghastly Sanhedrin, another travesty before another Pi
late. As she entered the Hall of Justice she walked be
tween two lines of white-clad women, each of whom
carried a hymn book. The scene of the inquiry was sur
rounded by five thousand people. Tension was incredible.
A band of Temple worshippers bore down upon and
demolished a side-show in Los Angeles purporting to
dramatize what had actually happened. She was charged
with intent to carry out criminal conspiracy and also with
falsely and maliciously planning to charge another with
kidnapping.
Conspiracy? It was the conspiracy of the underworld.

charged most repeatedly before her congregation and in
the columns of the papers which carried her syndicated
account of the affair. She had been warned to soften her,
remarks about sin; these warnings she had scoffed. By
a very simple and time-honoured method she succeeded in
turning the charges of the state into a heartless persecu
tion of her and her flock. In her running account which
the newspapers carried she said: "I have waged unre
lenting battle with the Bat-like Demons from Hell and
they fear me and revile me as the Devil hates holy water."
The method by which the transfer from her to the Lord
and the Lord's people is made may be seen from the fol
lowing quotation taken from her account:
Scheme, scheme, scheme, cry the pack, snarling at my heels, biting at
God's cloak. ... It isn't me that my detractors hurt—they do not real
ize that they are striking at God in their attempt to pull down His
temple. . . . Already the wraths of heaven are descending upon those
who have accused me. It is not I, but they, the detractors of His
servant, who will soon be in the Hades of torment.
Again she says, in a language which smacks strangely
of that used by Colonel Simmons: "I am being crucified
by the very bats of hell, who have gone the limit in per
fidy." The whole world has turned against her, with the

nasty publicity it got, she stands still unscathed, and her
believers unshaken. Can we say that this is not a religious
coup d'etat?
Writing in the February 1928 Bridal Call Foursquare,
Reverend Oscar Lewis leaves no doubt as to how she is
regarded by her followers: "Sister McPherson is your
pastor and what a vast congregation Sister enjoys here,
but Sister McPherson does not belong to you. She belongs
to the races and to God and to the nations." And in the
April issue Dr. A. L. Fraser continues the legend by
referring to her as one "whose foot like Noah's dove, has
found a transient rest in the ark of Angelus Temple, but
whose parish is the world." She obviously sustains no
ordinary pastoral relationship to her flock.
There are points in which she compares almost line
for line with the other great women leaders who have
founded sects. In common with Mrs. Besant, Mrs. Eddy,
Madame Blavatsky, Mother Ann Lee, she has not found
the restraints of married life to her liking. She has the
iron will and steel nerve which all of the foregoing have;
she hasn't anything like the mind that Mrs. Besant has,
nor the harsh and at times vicious temperament of Ma
dame Blavatsky. She has the genius for organization
that was Mrs. Eddy's and something the same canny
ability to sew up the whole organization. But she has
more than any one of them and more than all of them
put together, and that is genius for using modern meth
ods in promulgating her sect. She
is,
let us say, Mother
Eddy in modern dress. She

fact the instruments of salvation. Inventions signalize
change and decay in old systems. Thus to find the old
system actively at work in Angelus Temple is a most po
tent and striking evidence, to those who want that sort
of evidence, that religion is changeless and eternal, that
the Lord is still with us. In brief, Angelus Temple jus
tifies the Twentieth Century religiously.
It is obvious to any serious student of religion that
Christianity, founded upon an agricultural economy, has
hard sledding in a world so utterly mechanized as ours
today. This fact is equally obvious to those credulous and
fearful people who make up Sister's congregation. They
want to feel at home and lordly in the wretched society
that matures there. The world they live in is alien to
the spirit, and they welcome with great hearts and re
joicing any attempt to make that world by its own in
struments a paradise of religion. Angelus Temple does
that. In the first place, the Lord built it. That is the
solemn utterance of the pastor and the equally solemn
belief of the people. Mrs. McPherson says: "With the
hand of the Lord to guide us, it was done. We made of
Beautiful Angelus Temple, of the adjoining six-story
building of the International Institute of Foursquare
Evangelism, places of worship that were open and in use
three hundred and sixty-five days of the year and twenty-
four hours of the day." Yet if one imagines for a mo
ment that Angelus Temple is no more than a machine of
one hundred percent, efficiency, let him observe the spirit
ual dynamo of the Church. "There is not a minute, day
or night, week in, week out," says Sister, "in which An
gelus Temple does not lay the golden coin of reverent
prayer before the Throne. In the Watch Tower close to
the stars for over four years now four volunteers have
been constantly and without interruption sending their
supplications to God. In two-hour shifts four devoted
women pray during the day, each volunteer participating
only one shift a week, and during the still hours of the
night the men take up the joyous task." Every member of
the congregation is a spiritual specialist, ready at all times
to help the needy, and even the janitors have been known

to convert sinners in the dead of night while conducting
them to the heights of the Watch Tower. Every statistic
has loving significance.
Angelus Temple maintains a vast and far-flung serv
ice station for quick relief, and it meets the age-old prob
lems of the average sufferer in a modern fashion-—
modern in the sense that machinery is used for the
achievement of good. Mrs. McPherson tells us that daily
and nightly the temple receives hundreds upon hundreds
of messages —hurry-up calls for help. She reports: "A
woman will phone : 'I am despondent. I am going to end
it all and I am going to turn on the gas right this minute.
If there is anything Angelus Temple can do, for God's
sake do it now or it will be too late.' We say, 'Stop! Stop!
and tell her the story of Jesus, then run out and get her
and she gives her heart to Jesus." It is in order to meet
these daily exigencies that the Foursquare Gospel Light
house System has decided to install cruisers. They are
motor-cars fitted up like efficient life-boats and they are
to dash out on emergency calls and bring the despond
ent ones to the Temple, where relief can be given at once.
It is both mechanics and psychology which Sister uses
in the healing services that have made her so adored. She
describes in her autobiography the manner in which one
of these services is conducted. First there is the singing —
rampant, hilarious, ecstatic singing. Then comes the tes
timony of one who has been previously healed. As the
specimen mounts the platform the great organ bellows
forth an impressive melody and following that are the
words of the man who was once a cripple. Mrs. McPher
son notes : "Mentally, they were comparing their ills with
his . . . Lo! He stood before them whole. They were
all drinking it in. . . ." 8
When the man had finished the organ pealed out again.
There was a growth of exaltation, a growth of power;
it grew a thousand fold as the organ played, and soon
the audience quivered with its own sense of strength.
Then came more singing. "Sweet Hour of Prayer";
"What A Friend We Have in Jesus"; "I Need Thee,

Oh I Need Thee." The singing quieted, but still they
played a soft obligate. It was at this time that the priestess
stepped forward:
Speaking to them of the necessity of their faith, I told them that the
Lord would heal them, but only if they believed in Him; that Christ
was the same, with the same compassion, the same power, yesterday, to
day and for ever.
"I believe! Oh, I believe!"
It was a mighty shout as I finished, an inspiring crescendo of faith
from those thousand of weakened throats. But there was no wavering
in their voices now, nothing but a high-pitched chorus of eagerness.
The maimed, the halt, and the blind had been care
fully marshalled, ready for leading on to the platform.
The signal was given at the proper moment and the first
sufferer was brought forward. The first one was a para
lytic who had not set foot to the ground for years. Turn
ing to her, Sister said, after inquiring as to her faith:
"Then the Lord maketh thee whole. Arise and glorify
His name!" A tense moment followed, then the woman
lame from infancy did walk. At this point, "The organ,
full-throated now, poured forth in transcending pzans
of praise, 'All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name.' The on-
looking throng thundered their hallelujahs. Those wait
ing in that long line were strengthened in their faith by
that which had already come to pass for that one who
was first."
In the temple there is a special room reserved for
wheel chairs and crutches left as evidences of complete
healing. The list of solid cures and the candour of the
testimonies available rival those of the School of Silent
Unity. But Angelus Temple has the edge on all the cults
because it seems merely to restore to full reputability and
efficacy the faith that was so long ago delivered unto the
saints. From Greenland's icy mountains to India's coral
strand the work of Angelus is growing and spreading
rapidly. At present there is no mission in New York,
"although we hope sometime in the near future to see the
Foursquare Gospel Lighthouse rays flashing across the
skies of that metropolis." There are, however, one hun

and others coming in all the while. There is one now in the
fertile little town of Booker, Texas, for example, and the
cult has extended its domain into every territory where
the people want a new and simple gospel. Within the
past three months two missionaries have left for China
and a family of five for the Panama Canal Zone to carry
the gospel message to those in darkness. Brother V. A.
Howell, missionary to India, reports in the latest issue of
the Foursquare Crusader that in three weeks the Lord
"baptised thirty-five with the blessed Holy Spirit." The
first was a young man "who came through in the Telagoo
language." Another, a Salvation Army worker, while
Howell was preaching, "fell under the power and after
eight hours in his baptism came through in the Chinese
language." In the amazing scenes which followed "forty-
three were baptised with their Lord and some went un
der the water talking in tongues."
It is the fact of primitive religious emotions and
mediaeval theology functioning to all appearances so
properly in the midst of Twentieth Century machinery
that attracts the multitudes and keeps them joyous. It at
tracts the hang-overs of the last generation and the un
stable members of the one now rising. It uses the old
hymns that have shaken sinners for a century, the old
catch phrases that have put the fear of God into the
hearts of sailors and prostitutes, the old assurances that
have brought to drab and lowly mammals the sense of
peace and kingship in an alien and ominous order of
society.
The religion we have within the tinted walls of An-
gelus is of course not merely apostolic; it is primitive and
savage in its naive spirit. The whole sanctuary has been
planned with an eye to theatricality. Songs often punc
tuate Sister's discourses, so that the effect is precisely
that of a group of Negroes wailing their sorrows in prose
and suddenly bursting forth into the plaintive and creepy
tones of some melodious spiritual. We witness the kind
of spectacle one finds among Free Methodist camp meet
ings on the scorched plains of Texas, where women sweat
and howl and kick upon the floor to the glory of the God

she leads a lonely and thwarted throng of primitive
Americans in the mystic rites of the whirling tribal dance
—and all of it takes place in an edifice costing two hun
dred and fifty thousand dollars and goes out over radio.
To marvel at the success of Sister's venture is only to
show one's ignorance of religious history, particularly
in America, and to laugh at it is only to show one's failure
to understand the rudiments of religious behaviour. After
all, Angelus Temple has given us what we regard as most
convincing—a well-housed and efficient organization that
gets tangible spiritual results. It uses the methods of
Steinmetz and Edison to practise the religion of Paul and
Silas. It is not surprising that its influence has grown so
enormously, for as a people we are mechanically ad
vanced but emotionally primitive.

THE MENNONITES
SINCE this book was prompted by a friend who asked
me why the Mennonites wear hooks instead of buttons
on their breeches, I suppose that vital question should be
answered first. And I am not sure but that in the answer
lies the whole story of these odd people who have with
stood so long and successfully the wickedness of modern
civilization. Older by two centuries than the Methodists,
they yet retain those idiosyncratic customs and beliefs
which set them apart and make them singular speci
mens in the study of modern religious sects. Anyone
who in childhood who has come suddenly upon six
bearded giants driving a wagon across an Oklahoma
creek bottom and has had his inquiries silenced by the
mere explanation that they were Mennonites will readily
understand why no book on the current religious scene
is complete without the Mennonites. They are by long
odds the queerest of the lot, and simply because their
dress and speech and practices have so thoroughly os
tracized and caged them for the inspection of us mod
erns. The Quakers are always commonplace when one
gets to know them, but the Mennonites never are. The
Holy Rollers are theatrical, the Mennonites are a per
manent exhibit. The Dukhobors withdraw from the
haunts of men, the Mennonites live among us and are
never known even by those outsiders who associate with
them most frequently. Occultists are a worldly lot, fol
lowers of eerie and creepy things; the Mennonites are
in the world but not of
it,
sojourners for
a
time upon this
planet but only waiting for the summons to the world
above. And whereas occultists take this planet as

less route to higher things, the Mennonites regard it as a
mere Siberia to be endured until they are gathered up
into everlasting glory.
The truth is that the vast majority have gone over to
buttons, have forsaken the traditions of their elders and
adopted both buttons and suspenders. In what is com
monly regarded as the parent church in America, not only
are these devices legal, but even shaving has of late be
come optional. For despite what I have said, America
has cast its sinister influence upon the sect, and the mod
ern world of machine and noise and sin has not left the
disciples of Menno uncontaminated. The Shakers per
ished from the earth because they refused so intrepidly
to adapt themselves to the world which grew up about
them. The Mennonites have, with worthy and extensive
exceptions, made compromises and adjustments and now
promise to survive along with the rest of the fittest. The
Mennonite Church in America, as the parent body is
called, stands today in the halls of the mighty. It has its
publishing house, its evangelists, its board of education,
and maintains a bustling mission among the heathen of
India. What is more, it issues bulletins and has statis
ticians showing the net gain from year to year. It is com
petently managed from a financial point of view, sends
out journals with dry discussions of God and the Devil,
conceals what peculiarities that remain to
it,
and
is
on
the whole simply another religious body—quite as colour
less and enterprising as the Southern Methodists. Its
headquarters and efficient organization have placed
it
upon an equal footing for competition with any of the
large denominations, and as the reward of its progressive
tactics, the adherents of the body numbered forty-five
thousand at the end of 1927. Under the auspices of the
Mennonite Book and Tract Society, "over six hundred
tracts under as many different titles have been printed by
the hundreds of thousands and distributed promiscu
ously."

showed its ugly head as long as twemy years ago, when a
group of young professors arose with the idea that the
Mennonites were old-fashioned. It was evident that
"some of the students were imbibing the corroding and
deadly influences of the so-called higher criticism"; im
mediately the members of the Mennonite Board of Edu
cation became alert and with strong arm and pure heart
cleaned out Goshen College.
Progressive forces are everywhere in the ascend
ancy, and though there is an inherent tendency toward
conservatism which holds over—almost as a vestigial or
gan —the Mennonites today are fast becoming standard
ized, fast coming to repeat the performances of every
one of the greatest common denominations.
By dint of efficiency methods and high pressure, the
regulars were able to report in 1927 a substantial growth
of the fold. "This," the annual report says, "is encourag
ing and helps to spur us on to do greater things in the
coming years, if the Lord tarries." The Mennonites have
sallied out to save the world and gather the sinners into
the fold before the end finally comes. Their first mis
sionaries were appointed at Elkhart, Indiana, in 1898,
and the place to which the Lord led them was Dhamtari
in the Central Provinces of India, where they now have
twenty-seven missionaries, seven churches, and eleven
hundred communicants. The main body comprises fif
teen conferences, stretching from ocean to ocean, and the
conference in India is large enough to stand alone. It is
engaged now in the task of getting the more conservative
branches, the old dyed-in-the-wool Mennonites, who
constitute some more than a hundred miscellaneous
bodies and are by far the most interesting of the lot, into
the regular organization. But the work is confessedly
slow and tedious. For Mennonism began as a reaction
against a reaction and every one of its innumerable cel
lular divisions since has been a further retrogression to
ward conservatism. Only the regular church has pro
gressed, and that not far enough to take it completely out
of the curious class.

THE MENNONITES 417
have sprung from the holy impulse to put the church once
again upon an apostolic basis. The Campbellites may be
taken as a classic example, and this motive on the part
of the Mormons is too obvious to mention. Both Alex
ander Campbell, who thundered noisily against Joseph
Smith, and the Prophet himself, had this in common:
They wanted to restore the primitive church; modern
innovations were heresies; the proper movement was
backward. This applies as well to the Mennonites. It
sprang, in the main, from the profound feeling on the
part of certain reformers that the reformation had really
not gone deep enough. It is closely linked with the Ana
baptist movement, though the regulars today deny and
resent the implication that the Mennonites evolved from
the Anabaptists. They rather gave force to the Anabaptist
movement.
Suffice it to say that the Mennonites, regular, Amish,
and conservative, owe their name to the Priest Menno
Simons. Menno was a heretic. He was but twelve years
of age when Luther sounded the clarion call of the Ref
ormation. After finishing his studies he became a sort
of vicar in the village of Pingium, in Germany. Up to
this time he had not read the Bible. His associates in the
Church had some knowledge of Scripture, but Menno
himself declares that he never read it for fear of the con
tagion of heresy. It was as popular among the priests of
his day as "Bad Girl" in Boston today. However, Menno
was soon to touch the forbidden fruit, for about 1530 he
came to be flagellated with doubts about the mass. These
he bore as long as he could, then in desperation, he read
the New Testament to reassure himself. The disastrous
result was the conviction that transubstantiation was a
fable and that the various tenets of the Holy Roman
Church had no more ground in the Bible than did the
ungodly practice of infant baptism. Mustering his cour
age, Menno now passed from "the bosom of Rome to
the banners of reform," avowing two doctrines, which,
as Mosheim says, were looked "upon as flagitous and in
tolerable heresies." The first was the denial of infant bap
tism and the second was the baptism of all believers upon

the confession of their sins and the reception of the Holy
Ghost.
From then on Menno was chased hither and thither
in Europe until his death in 1559. Prior to his apostasy,
the Anabaptism movement had gotten under weigh in
Switzerland, where Konrad Grebel and Felix Mans,
members of the congregation of Zwingli, dissatisfied with
the half-hearted reforms which their leader had insti
tuted, went considerably farther and condemned the bap
tism of infants as the "greatest abomination of the devil
and the Roman pope." They likewise set out to re
establish apostolic Christianity and sought to preserve
only the two ceremonies which Christ used on earth, the
Lord's Supper and Baptism. They denied the authority
of civil government, rejected the paid ministry and the
use of the sword, and became the objects of intolerable
persecution throughout the Sixteenth and Seventeenth
centuries. It was with these scattered and often fanatical
devotees that the former priest of the Holy Church,
Menno Simons, identified himself. He became their
spokesman; he made their doctrines articulate; he gave
weight to their thought and fuel to their conviction. Thus
they became known at first broadly and then particularly
as Mennonites. A price was put upon Menno's head by
the civil and religious authorities and a written descrip
tion of his clothing and personal appearance was posted
on the doors of all the churches. He was unpopular, even
with the reformers, whose principles his own ministry
logically carried out. Martin Luther refers to him as a
"hedge-preacher, and one of those sneaking fellows who
associate themselves with labourers in the harvest fields,
or charcoal burners in the woods."
Among the ancient Anabaptists, whose teachings the
Mennonites perpetuate today, there were as many curi
ous cults as there are in America right now. For example,
there were the Apostolic, who travelled without staff or
shoes and carried no money. They preached from house
tops and acted like children, accepting literally the Bible
adage, "Except you become as a little child, ye shall in
no wise enter the Kingdom of Heaven." These were com

munistic. Then there were the Holy, Sinless Baptists,
who surrendered belief in the Fall of Man and believed
that they themselves could commit no sin. They omitted
from the Lord's Prayer the line, "Forgive us our tres
passes as we forgive those who trespass against us." There
were the Silent Brethren, who, when asked about their
faith, merely kept silent. There were also the Enthu
siasts, and it was of their number that the worst excesses
were committed. In 1536, six men and women ran naked
through the streets of Amsterdam, fell into a trance and
warned the citizenry of the wrath to come. The Free
Brethren had their property and their women in com
mon. They, too, were apostolic, believing as the modern
Dukhobors do that Christ wanted his followers to have
liberty of life and happiness.2
It was into this howling mass that the Priest Menno
Simons fell when he leaped from the Church of Rome.
And it was out of this motley host that the Mennonites of
today emerged. And though migrations have gone into
Russia and into Canada, the majority of these Sixteenth
century zealots have settled in the United States, where,
whatever may be said of their peculiar customs, they are
known to be honest, industrious and prosperous. Like the
Shakers and the Quakers, the Mennonites are, I believe,
universally respected as citizens, and it is difficult to
write intimately of their life, without growing sentimen
tal in appreciation of their kindness of heart and hos
pitality.
A number of the beliefs and practises that the early
Mennonites instituted in Switzerland and Holland have
carried over bodily in America, and though each of the
interesting divisions which I shall discuss presently em
bodies and lends emphasis to a particular trait, it should
be noted here that these early worshippers had qualities
which set them sharply apart in their own day. They
regarded themselves as strangers on earth; they refused
to believe that the Holy Ghost was a person; they held
than any wedding performed outside of the community
was worldly and invalid; they combined the rite of foot

washing with the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; and
they set up the ban of excommunication: when a man
sinned he was excommunicated from the body and the
brothers and sisters were not permitted to have any sort
of intercourse with him. The preachers were elected by
a majority vote and were not ordained; neither did they
wear any distinctive garb, for they do not constitute a
profession and demand no authority.
It is probable that the first Mennonites came to these
shores as early as 1650, though the first permanent settle
ment was made in Pennsylvania in 1683. The first who
came, before this permanent establishment, were the
Dutch, who came to New Amsterdam. When the English
arrived in Gotham, Heatwole says that these Mennonites
went over to Long Island, and that they settled with the
Quakers somewhere near Gravesend Bay. Those thirteen
families who established the settlement in Pennsylvania
purchased eight thousand acres of land, where they laid

number in Pennsylvania was greatly augmented and is

majority of American Mennonites are of Swiss origin.
Despite the inroads of modernism, the main body of
Mennonites in America still retain many of these cus
toms. This branch believes in the "Washing (literally
with hands) of the Saint's feet," and it declared in a
statement of Christian Fundamentals, prepared at the
Conference at Garden City, Missouri, that "footwash-
ing as an ordinance should literally be observed by all
believers." For the purpose of promoting the cause of
Scriptural attire, the Mennonite General Conference ap
pointed an advisory dress committee to study the prob
lem from various angles. This committee laboured on the
momentous matter for ten years and finally issued its re
port, together with interesting facts and data, under the
title of Dress. The whole tendency is toward conserva
tism and Apostolic rule and plainness. In Lancaster

County, Pennsylvania, Smith points out that the term
"turning plain" means joining the Mennonite Church.
It should be further noted that Christian women praying
or prophesying in this branch of the Church should have
their heads covered, that "the salutation of the holy kiss
should be appropriately observed by all believers," that
the Sacrament of annointing the sick with oil should be
administered to all who call for it in faith, and that "life
insurance is inconsistent with the filial trust in the provi
dence and care of our Heavenly Father."
Within the main body the attitude toward war has al
ways given weight and distinction to the Mennonites. Not
believing in "carnal warfare," they refused to take any
part in the Civil War. Some of the brethren refused to
fight or perform any labour remotely connected with the
work of the war. Those who were conscripted often re
fused to draw a gun on the enemy, and the outraged of
ficers had to put them on K. P. duty if they expected to
get any service out of them. Some of these deserted and
headed West, were overtaken by Southern soldiers and
placed in the Libby prison at Richmond. The brethren
back home offered the confederacy five hundred dollars
for their release, and it was accomplished. They never
made good soldiers, and never will. During the World
War they refused to fight, to buy thrift stamps or Liberty
Bonds, or to be conscripted into any service which had
the advancement of the Allied cause as its object. The
result was that in many sections of this illustrious com
monwealth they were tarred and feathered and their
houses painted yellow—the two standard American ways
of expressing distaste. Assembled in the Yellow Creek
Mennonite Church at Yellow Creek, Indiana, on the eve
of America's entry into the War, they sounded their dis
pleasure with the whole war system in terms and sincerity
which make the mealy utterances of Fosdick read like a
pamphlet of the National Security League. Some of their
sons were confined to Leavenworth.
So it is clear, then, that while the Mennonites may
show signs of turning Methodist they still have, even
among the most progressive elements, features which

mark them off from their colourless brethren in the Lord.
They are always seclusive, as Smith points out, because
they have always been so persecuted that they felt few
of the world's rights were theirs. "Nowhere else in
America," he declares, "can one get so close to the spirit
and customs of the common people of Switzerland and
Germany of three hundred years ago as among the Amish
Mennonites and some of the Mennonites of Pennsyl
vania." They are always the last to lay the old aside and
they are intensely suspicious that everything new is
worldly.
This is true not so much of the Mennonite Church in
America (the main body) but of the many sects which,
convinced that the parent Church was becoming careless
and fleshly, have stemmed from it and formed branches
of their own. A diagram of the one hundred and twenty-
odd different groups among the Mennonites of America
shows a division almost constantly in the direction of con
servatism. This is not a singularly Mennonite phenom
enon, I grant. There are some seventeen divisions of
Methodism, including the Free Methodists, the Inde
pendent Methodists, the Zion Union Apostolic Church,
and the Primitive Methodists who believe that the regu
lar followers of Wesley have gone off after the world,
the flesh, and the devil. The same thing may be said for
the Baptists, one group of which is appropriately called
the Hardshells. But growth by splitting has not been as
enormous among Methodists and Baptists as it has among
the Mennonites.3
Jacob Amman was one of the first backward reform
ers among the Mennonites. He visited the Swiss Church
in 1693 and was astounded at the worldly practises which
had crept in. For example, footwashing had been aban
doned and the Saints were growing careless in the matter
of shunning those who had been excommunicated from
the community. Amman insisted upon the restoration of
old practices and prescribed that those who had been ex
pelled should be denied all intercourse, that even husband

and wife should not be allowed to eat together after one
one of them had been turned out for sin.
It was Jacob Amman, too, who instituted the custom
of wearing hooks instead of buttons. It will be recalled
that buttons in that day were made entirely of bones, and
bones came from animals, and the true Mennonites, like
the Dukhobors, believed in using nothing from animals
which they could do without. Hence metal devices for
fastening on the trousers and coat were deemed sufficient.
Smith also indicates that hooks were a relic of an older
day when buttons were unknown, and that Amman was
bent upon being apostolic in a forthright and uncom
promising way.
Amman was opposed in his reform campaign by Hans
Reist, and the antagonism between the two was developed
to such an extent that they refused to ride down the
Rhine on the same boat during the exodus from Switz
erland in 1711. The Amish Mennonites, who are known
popularly as the Hookers, or Hook-and-Eye Mennonites,
came first to America in 1727 and continued to come until.
1757. They were a migratory and venturesome people,
settling first in the East then moving to the west and south
west. They set themselves up in Indiana in 1840 and in
Iowa during the same year. They were in Kansas in the
early eighties and have by now moved as far into the
southwest as Oklahoma, where there are several pros
perous settlements. Their principal centres, however, re
main in Lancaster and Mifflin counties, Pennsylvania.
The Old Order of the Amish still maintains rigorously
the customs imported from Switzerland. They have no
conferences and each community is independent. They
never believed in meeting houses or formal church build
ings. Indeed all such edifices were looked upon by the
entire Mennonite movement as worldly up until 1850.
With the Amish they are still unnecessary. They meet
about from farm to farm, generally every two weeks, and
worship in the kitchen or the largest room in the house.
They use the language of their ancestors. They are op
posed to Sunday Schools and revival meetings and to
meetings in the evening. They regard curtains, pictures,

and carpets as signs of pride unbecoming to a true Chris
tian. Among the new devices still under the ban are store-
bought suspenders, telephones, musical instruments, top
buggies, bicycles, furnaces and hymn books which have
notes in them. They all sing the melody of the hymn at
their services, for the use of notes with hymns was re
garded as savouring of pride and was for that reason pro
hibited, and to sing any more than one part of the four
parts set down with notes was considered a work of the
devil.* Their whole feeling was that to be worldly meant
to be like the people whom they saw around them, and
with high spiritual convictions they preserved and cul
tivated their peculiarities. Hooks and eyes are worn on
their vests and breeches. Their clothes are made of a pre
scribed material and divinely ordained pattern. Every
young man is required as soon as he is able to grow a
beard; the hair is long and cut according to the pre
scribed rule of the community. Preachers, being elected
and not appointed, are plentiful among them. At one
time in Illinois in the Patridge Community alone, there
were thirteen preachers, four of whom were bishops.
But there is great diversity even among the Amish.
The churches to be found in Mifflin County, Pennsyl
vania, illustrate this diversity. Smith tells us that there are
five varieties of Amish within the valley. These range
all the way from the very conservative, known locally as
the "Nebraskas," whose women still wear the old Shaker
hat and avoid bonnets like the plague and whose men are
not permitted to adorn themselves with suspenders, to
those Amish who worship in regular meetin' houses,
maintain Sunday Schools and have discarded most of
the restrictions, with the exception of the bonnet. Two
steps above the Nebraskas are the "Peacheyites," who
may wear a single suspender, provided it is home-made.
Next above these stands the group whose men-folk are
permitted to hold up their trousers with manufactured
suspenders but are allowed few of the other sinful pleas
ures of life.5

THEMENNONITES 425
The New Amish or Apostolic Church is by far the
most rigid of the lot. It originated with Sam Frolich in
Switzerland in 1832 and in 1846-1847 a number of the
New Amish migrated to Ohio. By 1909 there were sev
eral thousand there. They are remarkably exclusive,
obeying literally the Biblical injunction, "Salute no man
by the way." Since 1911 they have had headquarters in
Central Illinois. They will not listen, nor do the bishops
allow any members of the communion to listen, to preach
ing or praying or any form of religious exercise unless
it is performed by a minister of their own faith. For this
reason they never attend weddings or funeral services
of relatives or friends if these relatives or friends are not
members of their own body. They enforce the ban in a
manner which would have delighted Jacob Amman half
to death, for they allow husband and wife no privileges
once the ban has been pronounced against them. They
cannot eat at the same table nor sleep in the same bed.
This enforcement has worked havoc, so Smith tells us,
with a number of families. There were several cases,
notably that of Sam Moser, where the excommunicated
saint was ultimately driven into an insane rage and mur
dered the family which refused to have aught to do with
him.
Another conservative group gathered about a man
named Wisler in 1871. Wisler set his face staunchly
against four-part singing. But there was a young smart-
aleck in his congregation who set his face with equal de
termination to introduce newer methods. He went about
performing such heresies as preaching in English, and
Wisler in desperation forbade the young man, named
Daniel Brenemen, to introduce anything else new into
worship on pain of excommunication. Brenemen was
tried in 1870, and at the trial Wisler conducted himself so
shamefully that he was deprived of his ministerial con
nexion. He forthwith formed his own denomination and
it was strengthened in 1886 by the addition of a number
of conservatives from a settlement at Woolwich, Ontario,
who withdrew from the main body there on the ground
that it tolerated English preaching, Sunday Schools, eve

bers.
What little literature that is to be found on these va
grant Mennonite bodies is the product of hard toil and
conjecture. They are of course the most intriguing of the
lot, but the sad fact remains that they keep no record of
their doings. A few years back the regular Mennonites
started out to collect information on the status and polity
of the multifarious sects. At once they confronted this
impediment: The Mennonites of many bodies raised no
stones to their dead and kept no archives. While their
present status is hard to determine, every indication points
to a continuation among them of that same hard, uncom
promising conservatism that has always marked them off.
They owe nothing to the world, and while they are in
variably hospitable and beneficent in their dealings with
those they have to meet, they keep rigidly to themselves
and let the world puzzle about them as it pleases.

XX
ATHEISM
Atheism is by several howls the most fervent and
evangelical cult in the United States today. President
Charles Smith and the shrill Mr. Hopgood, his inimi
table secretary, will doubtless sue me for libel when I put
them in the same class with Pastor Russell, Mother Eddy,
Annie Besant, Swedenborg, and Frank N. D. Buchman,
but that is precisely where they belong. They have, by the
adroit use of propaganda and reverberating phrases built
up in the American Association for the Advancement of
Atheism an organization that rivals any sect, both in
the fervour of its appeal and the religiosity of its program
and tactics. I am inclined to think that the student of re
ligious abnormality in our times could safely overlook
all the others and confine himself to the zealous words
and deeds of the "4A,"as it is lovingly called in its
pamphlets; for we have here the most clear-cut example
of how a religion gets formed, what it does, and how it
operates. The movement parallels in every detail the
growth of other sects, and it has the advantage of being
sufficiently exaggerated and egregious to offer materials
for a rare case study in pathology.
The 4A movement is not the first to make a cult of
Atheism. Charles Bradlaugh did it in the middle of the
Nineteenth Century, and did it well. He did it by his
excellent speaking voice, his power of painting word
pictures, his captivating appearance and personality, his
ability to dramatize the devil and rally the hosts of
wickedness into a Cause. He shook London from centre
to circumference by his masterful addresses. He made

Atheism oratorical and consequently oracular. Together
with Annie Besant, who later deserted the fold of ma
terialism for the rapturous cult of Madame Blavatsky,
he launched and came near consummating a program
of social reform which could have brought in the atheis
tic Kingdom of God. He was a man of charm, of sincerity,
and of conviction —what more is needed in a prophet?
He believed as heartily in the absence of God as the
eminent Doctor Straton believes in his existence. His
belief in non-existence amounted to a faith, and his be
haviour, psychologically, was every whit as religious as
Straton's.
Nor must we forget the labours of our own Robert
Green Ingersoll. He made Atheism a faith, but he was
either not shrewd enough or too discreet to organize his
forces after him. He was but a voice crying in the wilder
ness, so that what work he performed now lingers chiefly
in the form of personal influence and lectures read on the
sly by young men in theological seminaries. He is cher
ished among the present zealots as a saint and as a sym
bol. He laid the basis for the sect of non-believers.
There have been other efforts, but none as successful
or naked as that of Charles Smith of Arkansas, who in
'1925, after some opposition from the bench, secured a
charter for the American Association for the Advance
ment of Atheism. The time, of course, was ripe. Dis
content had stirred the land. All of our emotions were
intensified by the War, with the result that those inclined
toward conventional religious ideas hastened off to the
excesses of the nightgown boys or grouped themselves
into Fundamentalist classes and declared war to the finish
upon the unbelievers both in and out of the Church.
Everybody saw red. Fundamentalism could never have
descended with such fury upon us if it had not been for
the War and its premature termination. It was essentially
—and this same obvious fact applies to the Klan —an
emotional movement expressing itself in abnormal re
ligious activity.
In short, religion became more egregious than it had
ever been before in this generation. Methodists, Baptists,

Presbyterians, Campbellites and all were given to ex
cesses and to extravagant utterance and action. Such a
teeming hullabaloo was sure to bring a reaction—and of
the very sort that the hullabaloo had modelled. Atheism
was as inevitable as either the French or the Russian Rev
olutions. The world was prepared emotionally for the
clarion call which it sounded —and it seems to me no evi
dence of its organizing power that more than one hundred
thousand of our citizens flocked to the banners within a
year after the Association was formed. Christian Science
rose to power because the orthodox Churches were de
cadent and moribund. Atheism started with a whoop
because the Churches were ridiculous and hysterical.
II
The first request for a charter was made in October,
1925. This request was promptly refused by the august
and outraged judge to whom application was presented.
The application was promptly put in again and just as
promptly it was turned down once more. Finally in No
vember of the same year, however, the charter was
granted, and there came into being the first organization
outside of Russia for the aggressive promulgation of
Atheism. It began at once to call itself a "Militant Foe
of the Church and Clergy," and at once set in motion its
messianic machinery. President Smith announced that
"We are going to undermine the Churches of America
as certainly as time." The organization at once resorted
to high-pressure evangelistic tactics, knowing full well
that it is by organization and engineering that anything
from soup to religion is put across to-day; and a year
and a half later Secretary Hopgood announced, that,
"We have found putting over Atheism in the United
States much easier than we anticipated."

Baptist University of Rochester—and had gotten its mes

the movement had already reached to the back places, for
chapters were to be found in the University of Texas,
the University of Kentucky, and the University of Kansas.
All of which goes to show how happy the hour was for
the opening of the campaign of the new religion. A paper
called The Truth Seeker had been founded for propa
ganda purposes, and its tirades upon spirituality had
grown as high-pitched as the attacks of the Texas Chris
tian Advocate on Burton Roscoe and Mr. Mencken. The
Ingersoll Forum had been established, and was soon to
become the Mother Forum for others in various cities
where Atheism managed to get a toe-hold. The seat of
this Forum in New York was soon moved to a hall im
mediately across the street from the Calvary Baptist
Church of the ineffable Doctor Straton, and though
President Smith denied that the location of the Forum
there was due to any animus, he did go on to say, "If
Straton doesn't like
it,
I
guess he can move."
Smith and Hopgood form the team that put Atheism
across. Smith
is
the silent power of the movement, and
Hopgood
is
the orator. Smith came from Arkansas and
Oklahoma. He had one year in Harvard and has prac
tised as
a
lawyer. He became an Atheist through the
reading of Thomas Jefferson's Bible. Hopgood, whose
appearance greatly resembles that of an earnest young
Epworth League worker,
is
oratorical and argumentative.
His later pictures show the wrinkles between the eyes
which grave concern for the Cause have wrought there.
He
is
clever,
a
maker of captivating phrases, and as
fearless as the Apostle Paul. He employs the same rhe
torical devices and the same thundering eloquence as
Colonel William Joseph Simmons used on the gathering
of the Klan. He calls the Bible
a
cesspool of Asiatic
superstition, says that in three hundred years there won't
be
a
church in America, and
is
hell-bent to rid the land of
the Big-Man-up-in-the-Sky stuff. He hopes also to open
the skulls of the younger generation, let out Catholic
superstition and Christian bunk, and insert logic and
truth.

of Atheism set sail from America. Here again the tend
ency to adopt the methods and purposes of the existing
religions is obvious. On that date Mr. Edwin Bergstrom,
who had organized a branch in British Columbia, left
New York to spread the good news in Sweden. The an
nual report of the Association says that a delegation was
at the pier to see him off, and that "Near by a group of
Christians waved farewell to a missionary of their own."
Atheism has its Fundamentals and it makes no bones
about it. The Atheists have set out to combat the Funda
mentalists and the ridiculous God idea. They have taken
their cue from their enemy. At any rate, here follow the
Five Fundamentals of Atheism r
(i) Materialism. —The doctrine that Matter, with its indwelling
property, Force, constitutes the reality of the Universe.
(2) Sensationalism. —The doctrine that all ideas arise out of sensation
and that, therefore, man can have no conception of an infinite God, or
of ultimate causation, or of that absolute moral imperative which certain
philosophers have made the foundation of Theism.
(3) Evolution.—The doctrine that organisms are not designed, but
have evolved, mechanically, through Natural Selection.
(4) The existence of evil. —The patent fact that renders irrational
the belief in a beneficent, omnipotent being who cares for man.
(5) Hedonism. —The doctrine that happiness here and now should
be the motive of conduct.
Can anyone read these windy Fundamentals and longer
doubt that Atheism is a religion?
It is as though the apostles of the 4A had gone care
fully through the catalogue of theology and set down
the opposite of every conventional doctrine. And what
is the result but a new theology and a new series of canons,
all of them to be rigidly enforced? Anyone who is ac
quainted with even the rudiments of psychology knows
that to deny the generally accepted God gives one just
as great a psychic kick as to affirm Him, and that it brings
to the individual just as great a sense of cosmic import
ance. Solemn denial of God is a religious act. Atheism
affirms the high importance of man in the manner of,
say, the Vedanta philosophy, by exalting him above the
standard idea of God. In its credo God is pictured as

a harmful delusion and consequently as a devil; man
is regarded as an enchanted wretch who is to be freed
of the God-idea and raised to a state of lofty character.
So it is that when Atheism erects a literature and
preaches a gospel on the non-existence of God, it occupies
precisely the same place in the social scheme of the Twen
tieth Century that Christianity occupied in the first. It
presents an outlawed religious idea; and to maintain a
position of outlawry some purposive conviction and
action are needed. The opposition is launched, not essen
tially against God as a being but against the idea of God.
The 4A, then, offers man a new idea of God—one that
comes into conflict with prevailing theologies and de
mands a martyr. The martyr is forthcoming, not only
because he believes in the new idea but because he real
izes emotionally that devotion to the idea pits him
against society; once this realization is in his mind he
will not surrender his belief, for it becomes the instru
ment of his importance, his individuality and singularity.
Then, too, there is a highblown social program, in
addition to the Fundamentals of the Atheists. There are
certain definite reforms which, if accomplished, will
usher in the atheistic millennium. These include such
sweeping and senseless proposals as the removal of "In
God We Trust" from coins. Their opposition to the em
blems of the enemy is ridiculous and quite as asinine as
the objection on the part of Methodist bishops to the
very existence of the atheistic organization. Their cam
paign literature carries the slogan: "Fight With the 4A.
Kill the Beast!" The Christ becomes the anti-Christ and
the whole scheme of the sect becomes an exact reproduc
tion of the early sect which at Antioch was first called
Christian. If one should go through the propaganda of
Atheism and change here and there the word Atheist
to Baptist, the result would not be noticeably different.
The verbs, the rhetoric, the zeal, the cosmic insolence,
the hatred—all could be left untouched and would
fit
as well into the scheme of the Christian Fundamentalists

ducted and Fundamentalism as it has been conducted
since the War.
Both the Messianic scheme of the Association and the
childish tactics to which it resorts in names and organiza
tions are strangely reminiscent of the more conventional
forms of religion. In a letter addressed to patrons and
prospects under date of February 7, 1928, Brother Free
man Hopgood writes with the zeal of a recently converted
layman, as follows:
Religion is dying, but so slowly that it may linger a thousand years,
blighting the life of man, unless organized, relentless war is waged
against it on a vast scale. You are invited to become a soldier in the
army for the liberation of humanity. Can you not enlist others under
the 4A banner? Together let's kill the Beast!
Take away the ideas and catchphrases for which
Brother Hopgood is indebted to religionists, and what is
left? Religion as interpreted here is sin, a sort of cosmic
blight and curse which must be eradicated from the earth.
"Relentless war" and "organized war" must be "waged
against it"—and not only so, but on a "vast scale." A
soldier in the army for the liberation of humanity! Where
is an evangelical religion which did not pull that wheeze?
"The 4A banner" as a phrase emblazons evangelistic
balderdash and smells to high heaven of the methods
which the archfiend of Atheism, William A. Sunday,
has used every since the day he deserted the professional
baseball for the sawdust trail. "Together let's kill the
Beast I" What is the Beast but a religion symbol? the
emblem of wickedness and sin and suffering and oppres
sions and all the other horrors both local and cosmic to
which every militant religion has addressed itself?
Take further the pathetic claims which the Atheists
make of illustrious personages. If Aristotle were alive to
day, says President Smith, he would be a member of the
Association. The same is true of Abe Lincoln. As it is
there is Clement Wood, Sinclair Lewis, E. Haldeman-
Julius, Rupert Hughes, and George A. Dorsey. We must
not forget Jim Tully, the President reminds us, nor that
Mencken would be one if he did not object to labels. So

it goes. Just as the village pastor got a profound thrill
when the late Judge Gary said the Bible must stand or
civilization will perish, and just as he claims the judge
and every other celebrity he can fasten his Christian
hooks upon, so does the Association prowl through the
catalogue of eminence and find those names which it can
use to bolster up its cause.
And suppose we look at the names which the various
branches over the country have given themselves. Is there
a vast difference between the "Busy Bees" of The Presby
terian Sunday School at Kaufman, Texas, and the
"Devil's Angels" of Los Angeles? Both are childish affec-
tatious and both are mildly funny. "The Society of the
Godless" in New York and the "Sons of Satan" in Okla
homa City (later changed to the "Truth Seekers") are
both names which have the yowl of adolescence about
them. They are poses, they are emblematic, and they are
unspeakably silly. None but a religious body could think
of such names. When a Sunday School class calls itself
the "Willing Workers," it accepts a banner, a religious
ideal, and it intends to fit itself into a tradition. When the
college students of the University of Rochester call them
selves the "Damned Souls," they are being just as
emblematic and religious. In Philadelphia are "God's
Black Sheep," and out in the University of North Dakota
is the "Legion of the Damned," whose high mogul calls
himself "His Satanic Majesty."
The time for self-conscious blasphemy
is,
of course,
most opportune. The profanation and desecration of the
temple has become
a
sanctimonious process to be re
ligiously performed. The whole truth of Atheism
is
that
it
is
frightfully religious-conscious. It
is
much too aware
of religion to be genuinely atheistic.
I
doubt not that there
have been and are many Atheists upon the earth. They
are for the most part silent fellows who have forgotten
that religion exists and they learn of
it
ever and anon
.with
a
start. But they do not form the back bone of the
Cause. The ranks of Atheism are recruited from young
fellows who are just out of their hippins. They have
not yet learned to live without
a
purpose. This,

is borne out of the fact that nine tenths of the young
folks within the ranks were formerly Epworth League
workers in days just around the corner. I cite the case of
Miss Christine Walker of Gap, Pennsylvania, who
now supervises the work of the Junior Atheist League.
She might as well be working on the Junior Epworth
League for all it amounts to her personally, for be
fore her desertion she was a staunch and dependable
worker in the Christian Endeavor Society of Gap. Those
who have given up the standard religion of their youth
and are not strong enough to stand alone and idle,
gravitate toward the ranks of the Atheists. The raw
material as well as the rhetoric of the present day move
ment is drawn from violent Christianity. Atheists today
are for the most part congenital religionists. When an
infidel talks incessantly of religion, I become suspicious
of his infidelity. The Atheists make a big point of the
fact that there are thousands upon thousands of men in
America who are privately Atheists but will not join
the Cause. They are, I suspect, entirely correct in their
estimate. But the point is not favourable to Atheism. They
will never recruit from those who are privately Atheists.
When a man has learned to keep his religion to himself,
he is much too civilized to join the strident chorus of
a bunch of puerile "damned souls" who want to take
"In God We Trust" off the coins of our Great Republic.
The true Atheist, if he were worth his salt, would not
give a tinker's dam about the liberation of humanity. Nor
would it make the slightest difference to him whether
the beast of religion were ever killed or not. In the
summary which it gives of the first year's work, the
Association reports that "We are instrumental in de
feating the vicious attempt of the religionists of New
York to have the Ten Commandments read in the public
schools." Would any really irreligious man care whether
they are read or not? Only those who have joined the
Cause can see the horror of religious practices. There
is a vast gulf between the irreligious and the Atheistic.

It need hardly be said that Atheism has been given
|what it needed to make it flourish as a cult, namely, per
secution. Salvatore Russo, head of the Society of Damned
Souls at Rochester when it was organized in 1926, was
taken out and beaten with a coal shovel by his fellow
students, then left alone on a country road with no choice
but to walk home after the beating. His father is a
spaghetti manufacturer, and the old gentleman's business
has suffered lamentably since the son became a theological
leper in his own community. Like most of the others,
iSalvatore was an ardent religionist in his earlier youth.
Now he has more than fifty of the Haldeman-Julius Blue
Books in his library, probably picked up at a bargain
when the Kansas publisher made his final offer in 1903.
He is as popular on the campus as a Christian Science
healer would be in Rochester, Minnesota.
During the early part of 1927 President Smith toured
|the Southwest, which in the judgment of the Association
is the citadel of the Devil. Its forces are to be concentrated
upon that backward territory with the hope that it may
be evangelized before it is too late. In Dallas, a strong
hold of Methodist culture, a young man became so en
raged at President Smith's evangelical faith in the non
existence of God that he challenged the silken Arkan-
sawyer to fight the whole question out with pistols. If
Smith had been killed, it would have demonstrated con
clusively, I suppose, that there is a God after all. The
hill-billies of Hunter, Arkansas, mobbed Our Leader,
showering him with stones and eggs. He barely escaped
with his life, and once again the whole question of Athe
ism versus Theism came near being settled in the good
old American way.

Legislature of his native state to abrogate those fatuous
regulations which forbid Atheists' holding office in that
commonwealth. While loafing about the State capital,
he saw several representatives gather about the Speaker's
rostrum and to his amazement heard them singing,
"When The Roll Is Called Up Yonder, I'll Be There."
It is as though Bishop Manning should one day find a
group of Columbia students gathered in the nave of the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine singing the ditty about
the widow and the barber's son. Our Leader was properly
outraged at the sacrilege and abomination of the temple
of state and he exclaimed, ere he could check himself,
"What a disgrace to the state!" The report got out that
the Atheist had said just those words, with the double
result that the Arkansas Legislature passed a resolution
declaring that the Constitution affirms the existence of
God and a lay Methodist preacher threatened to beat up
Our Leader unless he left town by the next express.
At Huntington, West Virginia, the clergy became
hysterical when they learned that the Atheist was to dis
cuss the merits of religion within the township. They
prevailed upon the Mayor to cancel the contract for the
use of the town hall. Then the state armory was engaged,
but the clergy again prevailed —this time upon the Adju
tant General of the state —and this contract was cancelled.
A private hall was rented, and it seemed that the stage
would be set. But two hours before the hour announced,
the clergyman, the Mayor, and one of the "Key men of
America" warned the hall owner that he would be ruined
financially, so the whole program was called off at the
last moment. In Boston, which the Association reports
is "culturally as low as Arkansas itself," practically the
same unhappy result followed the attempt to engage in
debate there.
Other incidents of persecution are to be found, for the
Association, like all good and shrewd religious bodies,
lists, catalogues and advertises them. It is said that, at
the request of Rev. Dr. Daniel A. Poling of New York,

sacred walls of the Marble Collegiate Church. Another
Atheist is reported to have been dismissed as fireman of
the furnace at Drew Theological Seminary, and later
beaten, for distributing the literature of the cult on the
campus. Arthur L. Evans, now of Cleveland, is said to
have been set upon and severely pummeled by several in
a place which the Association does not name. Jack Bryan,
an organizer for the Association, was threatened with tat;
and feathers in Ravenna, Ohio.
Of course John Roach Straton has done his bit toward
making the Atheists popular among every liberal-minded
person from coast to coast. He instituted suit against
President Smith upon the preposterous charge of annoy
ance by mail. It all seems to have grown out of the fracas
over little Uldine Utley. It was President Smith who
started action looking to the suppression of little Uldine
on the ground that she was a minor being exploited by
Brother Straton. The action got nowhere because the
child was not gainfully employed, and since she relied
entirely upon free will offerings for her support, the state
had no right to interfere.
At the height of Uldine's revival, President SmitK
sent Straton a challenge to engage in a debate with
Clement Wood at the Ingersoll Open Forum across the
street. Straton accepted on the condition that officers of
the Association attend his church. This they did, but on
the appointed day for the debate with Wood, who in the
light of his recent Outline of Man's Knowledge would
doubtless have disemboweled the pastor, Doctor Straton
was out of the city.
The failure to get together threw the weight of the
controversy upon correspondence. During the corre
spondence, the Association says, "President Smith en
deavored to enlighten Doctor Straton, even entertaining
hope of converting him from Christianity to Atheism, by
mailing him four pieces of propaganda literature."
Six months later, while President Smith was "in dark
est Arkansas," the pastor filed suit against the official of
the Atheists for annoyance by mail. An able counsel was
engaged and for the next six months the case was argued

off and on before Magistrate Gottlieb. The Magistrate,
a Jew, heard the case patiently, but with a curious Ameri
can twist to his thinking took offence at certain humor
ous references which were made to the Virgin Mary
during the course of the trial, and upon the basis of
these references, the Association charges, President Smith
was held for trial in Special Sessions Court. A few days
later the defendant sued out a writ of habeas corpus be
fore Justice Thomas C. T. Crain of the Supreme Court,
who upheld the writ and ordered the defendant dis
charged. But Straton and the District Attorney's office
appealed the case.
In commenting upon the action of the clergyman and
the first decisions of the Court, the Association says :
Not Mr. Smith, but Atheism is on trial. The success of the Asso
ciation, not the mailing of four pieces of literature, spurred the fanatics
to action. Dr. Straton is out to crush the 4A. This he will never do,
for "there is more solidarity among Atheists, and there are more
Atheists than he suspects."
Mr. Smith was later found guilty and fined one
hundred dollars. There will follow, no doubt, a number
of appeals.

The every-day activities of the Association are as
puerile and frantic as the names of its branch societies.
During 1927 Secretary Hopgood telegraphed President
Coolidge, asking him to forgo the customary Thanks
giving Proclamation. The President, curiously enough,
refused. When Coolidge declared that "the Bible is the
foundation of good government," the Association sent
him a telegram "giving evidence that it is a most un-
American book." Billy Sunday is hounded about the
country by blood-thirsty pamphlets, and when last sum
mer he went to speak in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, he
received a letter saying that leaflets and letters attacking
him would be distributed during the campaign. The
Association viewed his appearance as "a calamity" and

warned him to retire. In Portland, Oregon, when "the
ministerial alliance announced its nefarious campaign to
disrupt the public schools once a week, we warned that if
they proceeded, we would distribute immense quantities
of literature exposing the Bible." Vigorous protest has
been lodged with Postmaster General New against the
use of the walls of post offices by Christian evangelists
for poster advertising. Christine Walker, of Gap, Penn
sylvania, sent Uldine Utley a challenge to debate the
question, "Is The Bible A Safe Moral Guide?" and Free
man Hopgood threw down the gauntlet to Irving T.
Bush, the question which he proposed to decide by debate
being, "Is There A God?" When Mrs. Lillian Knudseri
of York, Pennsylvania, was prosecuted last summer for
blasphemy, the Association telegraphed an offer of legal
support.
By a clever and altogether admirable system of organ
ization the Association has begun to get its messianic
program under weigh. "Birth control," says the Associ
ation, "is practical Atheism. It substitutes the providence
of man for the providence of God by taking thought of
tomorrow. The so-called Word of God says 'It is good not
to touch a woman.' Birth control says it is good to touch
a woman. The Bible lies." During 1928 it founded the
American Anti-Bible Society under the leadership of
Tennessee's Grand Old Man, William S. Bryan. The
purpose and fervent hope of this branch of the Associ
ation is "to make a laughing-stock of the Christian fetisli
book, causing people to smile wherever it is named." The
"first engagement with the enemy" occurred when the
Chicago secretary of the Gideons warned Mr. Bryan and;
his followers "against stealing Bibles out of guest rooms
in hotels." The Society proposes to circularize hotel own
ers and commercial travelling men with a leaflet pointing
out the "more objectionable Bible teachings."
Proper use has been made of the "revolt of modern'
youth." This revolt makes the progress of Atheism all
the easier. Systematic agitation goes on among students
from kindergarden to graduate school and results have
been most encouraging. A branch has recently

organized in California which calls itself "The Hedonic
Host of Hell-bent Heathens." This branch had, at last
reporting, thirty-five members and "with systematic
proselyting hopes to have one hundred by the end of the
school year. The leader is an enthusiastic young genius,'
until recently very active in the church."
A seminary for the proper study of the cardinal doc
trines has been formed by the Association in New York.
Young men and women and boys and girls are trained
in public speaking, for it is oratory that Atheism pro
poses to convert the world from God. The beginning is
modest, but is hoped that it will some day culminate
in the existence of a seminary of Atheism in every large
city.
To combat the superstition fostered by the Catholic
Church in Mexico and Central America, the Confeder
ation Americana del Ateismo, with headquarters in'
Mexico City, has recently been formed. The leader of
"this gigantic undertaking to conquer a continent with
Science and Reason is Nanni Leone Castelli. . . . The
time is ripe to strike the death-blow to religion and in
South America openly to attack the clergy."
So the Cause advances merrily. Apart from the obstacle
of women, whom the Atheists regard as their greatest
foe, there is nothing that promises to stem the tide. It
seeks to establish branches in every community of im
portance, and to conduct silent, individual propaganda
where no flag is hoisted. It has opened a fund to prove
that man and the ape are kin by an experiment in
hybridization, and as soon as others have contributed
to the fund as generously as has one George T. Smith
and the proper candidates can be led to consent, man
and ape will breed to the consternation of the clergy.
A headquarters fund has been launched and a building
with club rooms and library will be erected as soon as
the damned souls of the Republic can be persuaded to
pay fifty thousand dollars for the liberation of humanity.
An ecumenical conference will be staged just as soon
as there are enough affiliated groups to swing

type awaiting release. An appeal has been issued to those
in all lands "who desire to rid the world of religion," and
a superb response is anticipated, for, say the Atheists,
their camp is not divided by bickering over various
Christs and revelations and gods. Yet I, for one, dare
to doubt it. Within two years I predict that there will
be the True American Association, the Liberal 4A, and
a probable Primitive 4A, with a follow-up by the New
Reform A. A. A. A. and the Authentic Apostolic
American Association for the advancement of Atheism.
The appeal of the present Association is issued exclu
sively to he-men and aggressive women, to adventurers
who will breast the storm of opposition for the new faith
and martyr themselves if need be in the arena of the
holy American Empire. "It neither apologizes to nor
compromises with the enemy." It avows:
Religion deserves no respect. It rests on the God-lie. We now know,
as well as we know anything, that there is no God. The time for doubt
and dodging is past. There is no excuse for calling oneself a Modernist,
Unitarian, Rationalist, Freethinker, or Agnostic. Atheist is the honest
and honourable title.
,The effort is made to enlist all classes of doubters and
seekers under the one honest and honourable title. Pussy-
footers are not allowed. There are those who respect and
adore the works of Paine, Ingersoll and Voltaire, yet like
the indifferent Christians, will not turn a hand in the
Cause of the saints. These are not wanted ; such
"
'respect
ables' don't belong in the 4A. They should join a
church," says Hopgood. Only these who will stand loyal
in the face of steady fire and hold aloft the flag of god-
lessness are desired. Particularly is the challenge issued
to youth, for youth, weary of the orthodox churches'
indifference and utter lack of crusading spirit, is ready
to volunteer at once for the fight on behalf of Atheism. A
pimpled youth may withstand the onslaughts of Billy
Sunday or Sherwood Eddy; but how can any red-blooded
young American resist this appeal?
Religion must go. It poisons life. If you would free mankind of its
frightful curse, fight with the 4A.

If there exists a young man who would not fight to
free humanity from a frightful curse he is a lousy pacifist.
[Youth has responded to such an appeal in every age;
certainly it cannot stand, fiddling and indifferent in this
hour of monstrous crisis.
The Atheists should be grateful that mankind is in
curably, explosively, religious; if it were not so, the
present method and appeal of its propaganda would be
as weak and futile as unexaggerated advertising.
I have exhibited the Fundamentals, the Saints, the
appeal, of Atheism. I have shown that their passion is for
martyrdom, their hope for the millennium. That they
have their devil is obvious, and it seems tedious to mention
the fact again. But I cannot resist giving the words of
the Atheists :
We treat Theists as they treat us—as enemies. To the tiresome
and timid noncombatants who continually chatter that more flies are
caught with syrup than vinegar, we answer the best way is to swat
them.
And that, I believe, is the best picture we have of
current Atheism—it is a sort of national fly-swatting
campaign, with unbuttoned boys and girls chasing about
the land murdering gnats and insects, with orators
haranguing the multitude and headquarters mailing to
innocent ministers a lot of vicious literature. There is not
a caper or antic in the whole side-splitting history of
religion, from the days of Astarte to Pastor Russell, of
which the modern Atheists are not guilty. Not by frontal
attacks or insidious indoctrination will they harm relig
ion, but by showing the world that they are relig
ionists and that religious behavior is the same the world
over, whether prompted by Baha'u'llah or by Freeman
Hopgood.

passages from the pages of Holy Writ, circulated gratis
to prospects and young converts to or from Christianity.
Its representation of the Bible is quite as fair and pur
posive as John Roach Straton's sermons on the 4A activi
ties. The New Doxology is a revised and uncopyrighted
version of that famous hymn, pointing out the catastro
phes which have befallen humanity since the days of the
flood. The Lost Boy is an exposition for deluded mothers,
for it "shows the folly of prayer." The books which the
Association backs, apparently because it regards them
as favourable to its cause, include Elmer Gantry, The
Companionate Marriage, Why we Behave Like Human
Beings, and that Gibraltar of human reason, The Outline
of Man's Knowledge by Clement Wood. In addition to
these there is now a monthly bulletin, soon to be converted
into a weekly paper, and the regular monthly issue of the
Truth Seeker, the official organ of the church. And over
and beyond all of these are the diatribes which the youth
ful members have written under the divine afflatus of
Atheism. One of the converts is Queen Silver, that
prodigy of Los Angeles, who conducts her own magazine,
though she is scarcely seventeen, and fills it with such
blasphemy as must make heaven reverberate with the
pained and angry cries of God. One verse will probably
escape the editor :
Arrogance —forgery —lies —
Arson and rapine and fraud ;
Tyranny —terror and spies—
This is the book of God.
I can do no better than to draw this comedy to a close
with words which I suspect leaped from the pen of the
fiery Mr. Hopgood. Whatever else may be said of him,
I'll say that he thoroughly enjoys the drama of Atheism
and that he has an imagination and power of expression
which should be put to less dangerous purposes than
driving a Lord from his throne. When all had been said
and done for the 1928 Bulletin, Hopgood closes with
these words :

The hour to overthrow the Church has come. Arise, ye prisoners

ful because you are on your knees. Stand up ! Cast aside supernatural
faith and fear! Be men!
The truth
is,
of course, that Brother Hopgood

boweled William Sunday. Change his nouns and the
whigmaleeries are the same. Just as
it
must cause sincere

a
great deal of pain to see some of their bish
ops perform, so
it
must give stolid and reticent Atheists
a
great deal of sadness, tempered by some amusement, to
see the capers of the 4A.
I
imagine they feel, and with
good reason, that the shrill and raucous ballyhoo of the
Association has turned back the progress of the cause of
irreligion at least
a
hundred years. Every Cause must
suffer from its excesses. This fact Christianity has sug
gested during the course of its two thousand years of
existence, and organized Atheism has shown conclusively
in its two.
The most concentrated and highly organized rebellion
against the God-idea in the history of the race, backed
by the superb methods to which American business enter
prise has given rise, ended by being

new religion—God,

A BRIEF DICTIONARY OF SECTS
Adonia Sromo, The. This sect grew
out of the Millerite revival through
the belief of a converted Quaker,
F. T. Howland, that he had be
come inspired. With a number of
followers who believed in a spiritual
dispensation to precede the mil
lennium, an association was formed
in iS6i, and in 1864 it made a set
tlement in Petersham, Massachusetts.
The sect was communistic, observed
Saturday as the Sabbath, and had
the Lord's Prayer as a basis of wor
ship. It was chartered in 1876, five
years after the founder's death. Con
trol was in the hands of a lawyer
whose character was questioned.
Dissension followed, and dissolution
occurred in 1897.
Advent Christian Church. Although
its beginning was claimed as occur
ring in 1844, this branch really be
gan in 1854. Its members hold that
man is unconscious in death till the
return of Christ Their faith is sim
ple and consists chiefly in a belief
that Christ's return is imminent.
Resurrection is considered the gift,
of God. The practice of immersion
and the Lord's Supper forms their
only ordinance. The church is evan
gelical, has churches in thirty-six
states, and in 1916 had a member
ship of more than thirty-thousand
which represented a healthy growth
during the preceding ten years.
Adventists, Evangelical. The oldest
of the Millerites (g. v.). They be
lieve in contradistinction to the
Advent Christians, that the wicked
are conscious in hell; the righteous
are to arise at the beginning of
the millennium and receive eternal
bliss. The wicked will be called
forth at the same time but con
signed to everlasting torment.
Adventists, Seventh Day. This church
originated in 1845-1846 upon the in
terpretation of Daniel VIII, 13-14:
"Then shall the sanctuary be
cleansed"—as meaning that heaven
was here, since the date of 1844, set
as the coming of the Kingdom, was
correct. Leaders were Joseph Bates,
James White, Mrs. Ellen G. White,
a prophet. They worshipped accord
ing to their name and believed in
immersion, unconsciousness in death,
the impending personal coming of
Christ. The use of alcohol or to
bacco results in expulsion from the
organization. In 1916 they numbered
more than sixty thousand.
Adventists, Other Groups. These in
clude the Church of God (Advent-
ist), the Life and Advent Union,
and the Churches of God in Christ
Jesus. The first of these seceded in
1863 because they doubted the divine
inspiration of Mrs. White. The
second was formed by those who
believed there was no resurrection
for the wicked. The third resulted
from a union of independent
churches in 1888. Doctrine and theol
ogy conform in the main with the
other branches.

450 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
ALTRUISTS, THE. This communistic
group is located in Sulphur Springs,
Missouri, and has one outstanding
trait which distinguishes it from
the majority of cooperative socie
ties: No religious requirements or
restrictions obtain and no interfer
ence in religion, politics, or family
relations is permitted.
AMANA SOCIETY. It arose in Germany
in 1714 and had a fugitive existence
until 1826, when a large estate was
leased in Marienborn, Hesse, and
by 1835 was quite prosperous. Per
secuted, Christian Metz and others
came to America in 1842. After
securing the Seneca Indian reserva
tion, 800 immigrated here. They
were called the Ebenezer Society
and were arranged in four villages.
In 1855 growth caused move to
present location in Iowa County,
Iowa. They were incorporated as
the Amana Society in 1859. Prop
erty is held in common fund and
only principal is returned upon with
drawal. There has been no prophet
since 1883. They use no water bap
tism, observe a biennial Lord's Sup
per, indulge in foot-washing for the
highest spiritual order only. Com
munistic entirely, the sect has no
amusements, although the order is
not ascetic. In 1916 the community
had a membership of 1,534.
APOSTOLIC CHRISTIAN CHURCH. Rev. S.
H. Droeltlich, a Swiss who came to
America about 1850 organized this
sect. It holds the doctrine of entire
sanctification. In 1916 the member
ship was more than four thousand.
APOSTOLIC CHURCH. Organized in 1888
in Philadelphia by Albert F. At-
wood, it has branches in Virginia,
Delaware, and Pennsylvania. It is
based solely on the New Testament.
Its reported membership in 1916
was 112.
APOSTOLIC FAITH MOVEMENT. It ap
peared in 1900. It is not a denomina
tion but an evangelistic movement
carried on by preachers. They visit
and pray for the sick without
charge. Distant ill are treated
through correspondence. They send
blessed handkerchiefs and similar
tokens for relief. Headquarters are
in Los Angeles, California, and
Portland, Oregon, and Minneapolis,
Minnesota. In 1916 there were 2,196,
which represented a sharp loss since
1906.
ATHEISM. American Association for
the Advancement of Atheism. Its
charter was granted in 1925 to
Charles Smith after two previous
court refusals. It has chapteri in
twenty colleges. Smith with Free
man Hopgood leads the movement,
which has met with apparent suc
cess among the younger minds. The
movement is highly evangelical and
militant and sends out floods of lit
erature to every name on its mailing
list. On January i, 1927, the first
foreign missionary sailed, with
Sweden as his objective. Its five
fundamentals are Materialism, Sen
sationalism, Evolution, the Existence
of Evil, and Hedonism.
BAHAISM. Name of followers of Ba-
ha'u'llah, self-proclaimed divine
leader of the Babis in Persia in
1853. Mohammedan in origin and
linked with the Shi-he sect of the
Twelve Imams. Believed that the
Bab, who manifested himself in
1848, restored communication be
tween the last Imam and his follow
ers. The Bab, martyred in 1850 in
Tabriz, before his death, however,
arranged for its continuance under
the leadership of the half brother
of BahaVllah. When BahaVllah
announced himself as a still greater
manifestation than the Bab, trouble
ensued, but his followers gained
control gradually and the name,
Bahais, has become general. Intro
duced in America by Ibrahim

George Kharu'Ilah in the nineties

fiaba'u'llah's successor. The great,
nine-sided temple, begun in 1902 on
the shores of Lake Michigan, is still
unfinished. Believe all previous
revelations of every religion ful
filled in that of Baha'u'llah. Hu
manitarian in interest. Counts more
than nine million adherents through
out the world, many of them of
other faiths, and has centres in some
thirty American cities.
Baptists, Duck River. They are chiefly
located in the mountainous regions
of Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia,
and Alabama. They appeared in the
Elk River basin in 1808 and were
brought more closely together by
conflict with the Methodists. There
are several kindred groups. They
are liberal Calvinists and believe in
immersion and foot-washing. In
1916 their rolls carried nearly seven
thousand names.
Baptists, Free. Benjamin Randall was
dropped by the Calvinists in 1779
and soon had adherents of his own.
In 1826 the first organization took
place. They have used a variety of
names, the present one being adopted
in 189a. In 1835 they took a stand
against slavery. The sect is not a
variant from the main church in
doctrine. The drop in membership
from more than one hundred thou
sand to twelve thousand was a re
sult of union with the Baptists.
Baptists, Free Will. This church had
its origin in a Welsh church in
Pennsylvania in 1703. It spread into
North Carolina in 1717 under Paul
Palmer. It grew healthily and re
ceived some of the Free Baptists,
who rebelled at the general union.
They believe in foot-washing and
anointing the sick with oil. Their
doctrinal basis is Arminian. In 1916
they numbered 54,000.
Baptists, General. The first church
was established in Holland in 1607
or 1 610. A number of them come
early to America. Robert Nordin
came to Virginia in 1714 from a
London church. They later merged
with the Free Baptists to form the
Free Will Baptists. The present
General Baptist church grew from
the colonists sent into the Cumber
land region in the early days. They
believe in the general atonement,
salvation to the individual, regen
eration through repentance, and the
possibility of falling from grace.
In 1916 they counted more than
thirty-three thousand.
Baptists, General Six Principle.
This branch originated in Provi
dence, Rhode Island. They are de
cadent in the extreme, and in 1916
were credited with 456 members,
scattered throughout Rhode Island,
Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania.
They are Arminian rather than Cal-
vinistic. The six principles are: re
pentance, faith, baptism, the laying
on of hands, resurrection, and eter
nal judgment. According to their be
lief the laying on of hands really
gives the Holy Ghost.
Baptists, Primitive. This branch arose
from opposition to missionary soci
eties and Sunday schools. First an
nouncement was made in North
Carolina in 1827. It is not organized
with the usual convention, etc.
"Hard-shell" and "Anti-missions"
are other names for the sect. It is
strongly Calvinistic. Some believe in
predestination. Immersion is consid
ered the only form of baptism and
is a prerequisite for participation in
the Lord's Supper. Ministers have
to be called of God and ordained.
It opposes instrumental music in the
church. Its membership in 1916 was
8,000, a distinct falling off.
Baptists, Seventh Day. In 1664 Stephen
Mumford settled in Newport,
Rhode Island. He attracted a fol-

THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
lowing, and the organization wa
completed in 1671. It is Calvinistic
and does not hold to strict com
munion. Celebration of the seventh
day is the chief distinguishing char
acteristic. Its membership in 191 6
was 8,000.
Baptists, Two-seed-in-the-Spirit Pre-
destinariav. Early in the Nineteenth
Century this form came into being
through protests of rigid Calvinists.
They were strongest in Tennessee
and Kentucky, although scattered
throughout the Southwest. Daniel
Parker was the great leader. He was
ordained in 1848. The churches were
scattered without organization. They
closely resembled the Primitives.
Their churches are extremely inde
pendent. Its name is derived from
the theory of two seeds, good and
evil which are both present in the
soul of man. Predestination is one
of the church's beliefs. Membership
in 1916 was 679.
Buchmanism. Name applied to the fol
lowers of F. D. Buchman, Lutheran
minister and Y. M. C. A. worker,
who went about among universities
both in America and Europe con
ducting confessionals, believing that
sins can be "washed out" only after
having admitted them in verisimilar
detail. These confessionals were
carried on at various house parties.
The chief appeal has been to un
dergraduates and rich youg rulers.
Buchman and his practices were
denounced by President Hibben of
Princeton in 1924.
Catholic Apostolic Church. It grew
out of the prevalent belief around
1825 of the coming of Christ in 1830.
Some received manifestations of the
Holy Ghost. By 1832 certain men
were considered apostles, and three
years later the number had grown
to twelve. The first church was or
ganized in 1851 in Potsdam, New
York, and the second in 1857. They
subscribe to the Apostle's Creed, the
Nicene creed, and the Athanasian.
The Holy Scripture is inspired and
the authority over all. Marriage if
inspired and indissoluble. They be
lieve in the laying on of hands, the
gift of tongues, prophecy, tithing, and
the speedy return of Christ. In 1916
there were 2,907 members reported.
Christian Science. Came from the
wellspring of Science and Health, by
Mary Baker Eddy, published in
1875. The organization came into be
ing with the institution in 1S79 of
the First Church of Christ, Scientist,
and has spread remarkably. It has
become a refuge for worried and de
feated souls of every rank. Mrs.
Eddy indubitably owed many of her
basic ideas to P. P. Quimby, al
though she denied this hotly. She
preached the sole existence of the
Divine Mind with the resulting non
existence of all matter including evil
and disease. Her spirit was the
driving force of the order until her
death, when it had received such im
petus that it is now rolling along
under its own power. The Boston
church is styled the "Mother
Church" and is the centre of au
thority. Policies of control and pol
icy have caused bitter dissension
with the splitting off of sundry
groups. In 1896 there were 400
churches and societies. From 1890 to
1906 the membership increased 900
per cent. The church has licensed
teachers, multitudinous reading
rooms for the public, and publishes
numerous papers.
Christian Union. Various bodies or
ganized in 1864, though the Evan
gelical Christian Union, composed
of seven congregations, had been
gathered together in 1857 by Rev.
E. P. Farmer. Dissension occurred
at the outbreak of the Civil War
and resulted in the formation of
the Christian Union, in 1864. The

Union gathered to its standards all
those who were opposed to the War
and to political preaching. In 1916
there were 13,000 communicants.
Church of God and Saints of Christ.
William S. Crowdy, a Negro cook
on the Santa Fe Railroad, in 1896
had a vision of God commanding
him to lead people to religion and
making him a prophet. He soon or
ganized a church with headquarters
-
in Kansas City. He was made
bishop, and later two white men
were elected to the episcopacy. He
claimed the Negroes to be descend
ants of the Lost Tribes of Israel.
The church teaches the Ten Com
mandments, a literal Bible, the Jew
ish Sunday, feast days with Hebrew
nomenclature, repentance, immer
sion, use of unleavened bread and
water as Lord's Supper, foot-wash
ing, the holy kiss. The last has been
dropped. Temperance is upheld and
no marriage is permitted outside the
elect without permission. In 1916 the
membership was 3,300.
Dukhobors. Of a venerable and much
persecuted Russian origin, this group
came to Saskatchewan, Canada, in
1899, after a stop-over on the island
of Cyprus. They came under the
patronage of Count Leo Tolstoy
and under the guidance of their
leader, Peter Verigin. They were
settled on good land by the Canad
ian government and have been
treated throughout with remarkable
kindness for a constituted govern
ment, in spite of the fact that they
eschew the registration of mar
riages and births and the attend
ance of their school by their chil
dren. The church is communistic
and pious, with a childlike faith. In
1902 sixteen hundred started on
a pilgrimage to meet the Messiah
in the northland. After suffering un
told privations they were persuaded
with difficulty to return. They have
prospered in numbers and wealth
with introduction of some modern
farming methods. Radical branches
do not believe in the domestication
of animals, and pull their own
ploughs and wagons.
Dunkards (German Baptist Breth
ren). This sect is commonly called
Dunkers or Tunkers. It originated
in 1708 and was founded by Alex
ander Mack. Its members immedi
ately found refuge in Holland and
then came to the United States, set
tling near Philadelphia. They were
early divided in two branches, with
some animosity between the rival
leaders. They have missions in
Europe, India and Asia Minor. They
believe in immersion, give their min
isters no stipend, and resemble the
Quakers in dress, avoidance of
oaths, and pacifism. There are the
Conservatives, the Progressives, and
the Old Order, differing principally
on degree of conformity to social
customs, habits of dress, and wor
ship. The Conservatives number
100,000, the Progressives 17,435, *nd
the Old Order 4,000.
Ethical Culture, Society for. Es
sentially a religious organization in
that it buries the dead, performs the
marriage service, and gives instruc
tion, this society makes no exactions
for membership, its constituents
varying widely on such usually
moot and important questions as the
nature of God and the probability
of immortality. The basis of union
is a sense of the common need for
betterment. It was founded in 1878
by Professor Felix Adler in the form
of a school, and has adhered tena
ciously to a policy of education and
uplift. Its organizations are scattered
in the larger cities of the United
States and Europe. It has always en
joyed the patronage of prominent
leaders and educators. New York is
the place of its origin and is still
its chief headquarters. Its growth
has been steady and sound.

454 THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
FOURSQUARE GOSPEL LIGHTHOUSE, THE.
Evangelistic cult founded by and
around Aitnee Semple McPherson
in Los Angeles. Angelus Temple
boasts the largest fireproof auditor
ium in the world. The membership
of 15,000 wear uniform white robes
to services. "Sister" McPherson prac-
ticcs healing of the lame. Pray
ers ascend from the Watch Tower
night and day by volunteers work
ing in shifts. Motor-car "lifeboats"
rush to despondent persons to carry
spiritual relief. Foursquare Gospel
Lighthouses are now in many itatei
and countries.
HARMONY SOCIETY (RAPPITES OR ECON-
OMISTS). The Harmony Society wai
founded by George Rapp in 1787 in
Wittenberg. In 1804 600 landed in
America and took up land near
Pittsburgh. In the following year it
became "The Harmony Society."
Possessions were held in a common
fund. There was uniform dress. It
was a success from the beginning.
Belief in the second coming of
Christ and celibacy prevailed. In
1814 they removed to Indiana and
ten years later sold the property to
Robert Owen, who named it "New
Harmony." Returning to Pittsburgh,
the community was called "Econ
omy." Adhering faithfully to celi
bacy, the group had disappeared by
1903.
HOUSE OF DAVID. Directly connected
with the cult of the Seven Angelic
Messengers which began with Joan
na Southcott as the First Messenger
in 1792. Benjamin Purnell, a broom
maker, in 1902 announced himself
to be the Seventh Messenger and
established a colony for the consum
mation of the Lord's work at Benton
Harbor, Michigan. He was to as
semble the 144,000 chosen males and
an equal number of females for
the millenium. Property later valued
at $375,000, with membership of
about six hundred. Believed that
members of the colony who kept
faith would never die. Opposed,
avowedly, to all sexual intercourse,
yet Benjamin himself was charged
and convicted of statutory rape upon
many girls. He died soon after the
trial in 1927. His followers expected
his resurrection and secured a
special permit from the city to post
pone the burial.
KNIGHTS OF THE Ku KLUX KLAS-.
Founded by William Joseph Sim
mons in 1915 officially on the top of
Stone Mountain near Atlanta. It
has a tenuous connection with the
Ku Klux Klan of post Civil War
days. Gained members slowly until
taken in hand and promoted by Ed
ward Young Clarke, who made a
great success. The order has voiced
its motives in high-sounding words
as the preservation of white supre
macy, national patriotism, and the
Protestant religion. It is clothed in
robes and much tomfoolery. At
various times it has exerted enor
mous political influence, especially
in certain state elections. It has met
with much opposition. Hiram W.
Evans succeeded Simmons as the
head of the order rather forcibly
in 1921.
LIBERAL CATHOLIC CHURCH. A body
entirely independent of the Church
of Rome but tracing its lineage
through the Old Catholic Church of
Holland and thus preserving its
apostolic succession intact. It was
organized in 1918 and by 1919 had
enough root in America to justify
the ordination of Irving Steiger
Cooper as Regionary Bishop of the
United States. It is now active in
seven countries. Its priests are free
to chose between celibacy and mar
riage and it claims to have no dog
mas. Its presiding bishop is the
noted theosophist, Charles W. Lead-
beater, who has given the present
twist to its theology. It is chiefly
an attempt to interpret the liturgy

of the Roman Church in terms of
theosophy. Bishop Leadbeater argues
that a bubble, visible to the trained
spiritual eye, forms over the church
during the mass, and that its form,
colour, and size depend upon the
attitude of the congregation and the
skill of the attending angel.
Llano Cooperative Colony, The. Job
Harriman, Los Angeles lawyer and
Marxian, founded the order in 1914
in California on the Llano del Rio,
with each member giving $1,000.
Membership grew to 700. Poor land
and dissension brought failure. A
large part moved to Louisiana where,
in 1926, they had paid oS the large
debt incurred there and in Cali
fornia. They had control of 20,000
acres of land. Harrison had previ
ously gone back to the California
group, which had practically dis
banded. An influx of colonists from
Texas proved unhappily detrimental.
Communistic from the beginning,
the colony became a success when
George T. Pickett, a capable execu
tive, gained control, although his
position modified the communism
practised. The present settlement is
called New Llano and is located
near Leesville, Louisiana.
Mennonites. Had beginning with
Priest Menno Simons, a German,
who broke with the Church of Rome
about 1530. He made articulate the
doctrines of many diverse groups
of anabaptists, and they came gradu
ally to be known by his name. First
settlement of any size in America
was made in Pennsylvania in 1683.
Main and progressive branch to
day has 15 conferences, 45,000 ad
herents, a college in Goshen, In
diana, 27 missionaries in India.
The conservative and old-fashioned
branches are opposed to war, sus
penders, buttons, top buggies, church
buildings, Sunday Schools, and four-
part music.
There are approximately 120 dif
ferent smaller sects of the Men
nonites alone in America. The chief
of these are as follows:
Amish Mennonites (Old Order),
membership 7,746; Reformed Men
nonites, membership 2,794; General
Conference Mennonites, membership
20,000; Stauffer People; Church of
God in Christ, Mennonite, member
ship 2,100; Defenceless Mennonites,
membership 1,040; Wisler Mennon
ites, membership 1,940; Mennonite
Brethren in Christ, membership 7,-
587; Central Illinois Conference of
Menonites, membership 2,874 ; Amish
Mennonites (Conservative), mem
bership 2,794; Russian Mennonites.
Methodists, Free. In 1850 in general
conference of Methodist Episcopal
Church Rev. Benjamin T. Roberts
thought the church had fallen away
from early standards. He published
an article in 1857 showing examples
of defection and suffered a repri
mand. The article was later repub
lished by another, and he was un
frocked despite his protestation of
innocence. With him a large num
ber were expelled. These, coupled
with withdrawals, organized at
Pekin, New York, in i860. Rob
erts was the first general superin
tendent. There was a membership
of 35,291 in 1916.
Methodist, Primitive. This was
formed in a circuitous way by the in
troduction of the American camp
meeting into England. The later ex
pulsion of believers brought the
group to America. The first mis
sionaries came in 1829. It closely
resembles the Methodist Episcopal
Church in doctrine and faith. Its
reported strength in 1916 was 9,353.

Church. By a clever interpretation
of prophecies he taught that the
millennium would follow, not pre
cede, the end of the world. The
year 1843 was set as the end of the
world; that failing, the fall of 1844
was named. After that Miller dis
couraged the setting of any definite
time. A conference at Albany, New
York, in 1845, resulted in seven di
visions of the Second Adventists.
Miller died at Low Hampton, New
York, in 1849, but his followers are
still aggressive. They spend over
four hundred thousand dollars an
nually in world missions.
Moravian Bodies, The. Moravian

ship 26,373; Evangelical Union of
Bohemian and Moravian Breth
ren in North America, membership
1 714; Independent Bohemian and
Moravian Brethren Churches, mem

lations with Luther and Calvin.
Their interest early turned to ed
ucation with a translation of
the Bible as a result. Persecution
caused their removal to Saxony with
establishment of the present church
in 1735. They are evangelical in na
ture. This attribute caused them
soon to push to North America. They
were first in Pennsylvania and
Georgia. Bethlehem was founded in
1741, and a cooperative union ran
until 1762. Their organization was
modernized in the period from 1844
to 1856. Essentially Protestant, they
have no decided creed. The church
organization is a modified epis
copacy. They are missionary, evan
gelistic, and strongly educational.
Mormonism. The Church of the
Latter-Day Saints. Originated by
Joseph Smith, Jr. who discovered
and translated Book of Mormon
from miraculously given gold plates
in 1829. Started his sect in 1830 at
Palmyra, N. Y., and a year later
moved to Kirtland, Ohio. Next went
to Illinois and founded Nauvoo. In
1844, after the destruction of an
opposing printing press, Smith and
his brother were killed by a mob.
Brigham Young, elected in 1847
to the headship, led them in the
long trek to Utah, where Salt Lake
City was begun. The revelation of
"celestial marriage" and polygamy
came in 1852, and the latter prac
tice was continued until 1890, when
the church officially frowned upon it.
Polygamy led the Mormons into
open conflict with the federal gov-
erment. The church is prosperous
and fairly innocuous at present. The
Reorganized Church of the Lat
ter-Day Saints. Broke off from the
main body in i860 because of dis
agreement with Brigham Young.
In i860 Joseph Smith, son of the
founder, became president The
church has headquarters in Lamoni,
Iowa. It opposed polygamy from
the outset and its members are
popularly known as The Josephites.
New Apostolic Church. This sect had
the same origin as the Catholic
Apostolic Church, coming with
the excommunication of Bishop
Schwarz. Prenss became leader, and
the movement spread. They believe
in the Apostle's Creed, the inspired
Bible, the sacrament, baptism, and
the Lord's Supper. Also they sub
scribe to the laying on of hands and
the speedy personal premillennial
coming of Christ. In 1916 the roll
carried 2,828 names.
New Icarians, The. Organized orig
inally upon the theories of Etienr.e
Cabet, a French socialist, the per
secuted adherents emigrated to
Texas in 1848, but because of a poor
location were glad to take the place
left vacant by the Mormons in Nau

part who removed to St. Louis. The
original body split again in 1879
into the Separatists and the New
Icarians. The former group was
communistic and faded eight years
later while the Icarians went into a
receivership and dissolution in 1901.
New Thought. This movement, wide
spread and diversified, had its origin
in the 'eighties in Boston. Warren
Felt Evans, with his writings and
interpretations of the doctrines of
P. P. Quimby, gave the impetus for
the movements which have become
considered as the New Thought
cults. The first church was the
Church of Higher Life, founded in
Boston in 1894. It has since spread
throughout the world, as churches,
as movements, and most commonly as
incorporated syndicates for the sale
of its supposed benefits. In its be
ginning its selling point was drugless
health, as in the case of Christian
Science, but latterly its leading com
modity has been personality and push.
Perfectionists (Oneida Community.)
The Perfectionists were the product
of the revival of the 1830's. Led by
John Humphrey Noyes they oper
ated on the belief that they needed
a reconstructed society to be able to
attain salvation. In 1838 the nucleus
was started in Putney, Vermont.
They were driven from Putney by
the force of popular opinion and
settled in Oneida, Madison County,
New York. Oneida, together with
Wallingford, became the headquar
ters of the sect. They believed that
selfishness was the chief sin, so
they embraced communism. Their
venture was an economic success.
Their doctrine of free love, in which
. every man was, potentially at least,
every woman's husband, and vice
versa, caused their dissolution in
1880 before an overpowering pub
lic disapproval. The venture became
a company with a guarantee of
every member's well-being. Perfec
tion was considered a result of
divine grace from Christ attained
from individual effort with freedom
from outward law.
Pentecostal Holiness Church. It was
organized in August, 1898, at An
derson, South Carolina, to fill the
need of closer union of churches
which came up after the revival
through the south and west. It tends
toward joyous expression in wor
ship and offers great allegiance to
the President of the United States.
It resembles Methodism in doctrine
and is premillenially inclined. Doc
tors are used in spite of belief that
provision is made for the body's
healing. Membership is limited to
the consciously regenerated. They
believe in baptism and the Lord's
Supper. In 1916 there was a mem
bership of 5,353 in twelve states.
Plymouth Brethren. This Christian
sect has extended itself since 1830
throughout the British Empire, Eu
rope, and the United States. It orig
inated in John Nelson Darby, which
caused the Continental name of
"Darbyites." The congregation at
Plymouth was founded in 1830. Its
tenets are founded on the most lit
eral interpretations of the Scripture,
each word of which is divinely in
spired. Premillenarian views ob
tain. The Lord's Supper is celebrated
every Sunday. They reject all ec
clesiastical authority. Practically any
brother may pray or preach, but
those "not gifted with utterance" are
quietly discouraged from officiating.
A schism occurred over the human
nature of Christ, and Darby and his
followers withdrew. They later
subdivided more than once over
question of doctrine. There are four
branches with more than ten thou
sand, eight hundred communicants.
Rosicrucians. As at present rampant
in the democracy, the ancient order
of Rosicrucians comprises three

rnnin divisions: The Societas Rosi-
cruciana, the Rosy Cross of Amer
ica, and the Rosicrucian Fellowship.
All branches are based upon the
assumed existence of one Rosen
Kreuz in the Fifteenth Century
who had visited the Orient and im
bibed sacred mysteries there. His
society is closely connected with free
masonry but the present branches
have little or no connection with
the original society —though each of
course claims to be the authentic
guardian of the arcana. The So
cietas Rosicruciana maintains the
most dignified front and numbers
cultured people among its members.
The order of the Rosy Cross has
t following in innumerable small
towns throughout the country. The
Fellowship at Oceanside, California
sprang into prominence with the
conversion to its teachings of former
Governor Johnson of Oklahoma
and the subsequent political up
heaval in that stormy state.
RUSSELLISM (INTERNATIONAL BIBLE
STUDENTS ASSOCIATION). Sprang and
pulsed from the lifeblood of "Pas
tor" Charles Taze Russell, who in the
latter part of the Nineteenth Century
worked out a creed which included
the nonexistence of hell. He early
employed the sure-fire device of
prophesying the millennium and the
imminent coming of Christ when the
existing order would be overthrown
and the forces of the devil, includ
ing all other churches and creeds,
destroyed. The elect, that
is,
the
Russellites, were to take control. He
travelled widely, preached with
equal latitude, and gained many fol
lowers. He came to New York in
1909, and with the rapid growth of
his organization moved to gigantic
quarters in Brooklyn. His previous
divorce and the scandal of "miracle
wheat" were two of the off-colour
phases of his career. He died in
191$. The stubborn persistence of
the world in existing, and the neces
sary postponements of the millen
nium, have not daunted his fol
lowers in the least

SCHWENKFELDERS. Kaspar von
Schwenkfelder was an enthusiastic
worker in the reformation. He died
in 1561. Two hundred of his fol
lowers came to Philadelphia in Sep
tember, 1734. They moved to Le-
high County and the surrounding
country and established themselves.
The majority have remained there.
A closer union was effected in 1782.
They opposed war, secret societies,
and the taking of oaths. They have
dropped the ban on secret societies
and leave the attitude toward war
to the individual conscience. They
maintain the Perkiomen School. The

the only basis, of their be

unimportant. In 1916 the member
ship was 1,127.
SHAKERISM (United Body of Believer*
in Christ's Second Appearing).
Brought to this country in 1774. from
a
sect of Shaking Quakers in Eng
land by Ann Lee, believed to be the
Mother of God or the Christ Spirit
in its consummating manifestation.
The Shaking Quakers by whom
Mother Ann was received as the
new messiah, sprang from the
French Prophets,
a
band of Protest
ants who were mercilessly perse
cuted first in France and later in
England. They were seized by
vigorous shakings, which often in
duced the gift of prophecy. The
Shakers met with similar persecu
tions in pioneer America. Their

this latter outpouring. The strength
was greatest during the 1840's.
Practically extinct today. Colony
at Union City, Ohic, sold in 1912.
Few remain at Mount Lebanon and
at Harvard, Massachusetts. Groups
lived by communistic arrangement
and scorned machine-made commod
ities. Considered sex the worst sin
and forbade intercourse even be
tween man and wife.
Society of Separatists at Zoar. In
1817 wealthy dissenters driven from
Wittenberg came to America and
settled in Ohio. The presence of other
old and poor believers forced them
into communism. In 18 18 there were
225 members. Celibacy was advo
cated by Joseph Baumeler and was
permitted, although it never became
popular. In 1874 there were 300
members with a title to 7,000 acres
of land and proportionate wealth.
They were pacifists, opposers of state
schools ; they refused to bow in wor
ship, had no ceremonies, no ordained
ministers, worshipped in song, sanc
tioned sexual intercourse solely for
propagation, and deemed celibacy
better than marriage. The commun
ity was finally dissolved in 1898.
Spiritualism. Had its origin in the
alleged spirit rapping of the Fox
sisters at Hydesville, New York, in
1848, and by the enterprising work
of an older sister the cult soon
spread as far as St. Louis and had
produced phenomena throughout
New England. Some eighteen years
later it was introduced into Eng
land by D. D. Home. Claimed mil
lions of adherents, but in 1910 the
census reported 50,000. There is a
National Assembly, twenty-two state
auxiliaries, and some five hundred
local societies. Although the Fox
sisters confessed the rappings were
made with their big toes and that all
was a grand fraud, the followers
still believe in communication with
the dead by feats of mediums.
Swedenborcianism. Comprises two
main branches in America —the Gen
eral Church of the New Jerusalem,
dating from 1817 and the General
Church of the New Jerusalem, or
ganized in 1897. The General
Church has headquarters in Bryn
Athyn, Pennsylvania, where it main
tains a first rate college known as
the Academy. First movement to
ward organization made in London
in 1782 when Robert Hindmarsh, a
printer, formed a class to study the
writings of Swedenborg. Whole
scheme of both churches founded
upon belief that Emanuel Sweden
borg, a Swedish scientist, received a
divine illumination in 1744. At this
time he claimed to have been ad
mitted to full intercourse with the
world of spirits and to have re
ceived a special gift for interpreting
and fulfilling Holy Writ. He wrote
twenty-eight large volumes setting
forth his doctrine. These Writings
are the final court of appeal among
his followers. Complete editions of
his works in English have been is
sued by the American Swedenborg
Printing and Publishing Society of
New York.
Theosophy. The first Theosophical So
ciety was founded in New York City
in 1875 by Madame Helena Petrovna
Blavatsky, aided by Col. H. S. Ol-
cott and W. Q. Judge. As at present
organized it numbers more than
fourteen hundred branches all over
the world. General headquarters are
at Adyar, India. Madame Blavat
sky claimed (and her claims are ac
cepted by Theosophists) to have
penetrated the trans-Himalayan
fastness of Tibet and there to have
communed with certain Mahatmas.
These were the Elder Brothers of
the race, men of infinitely superior
wisdom, and they commissioned her
to found an occult brotherhood for
the perpetuation of their teachings.
Mrs. Annie Besant, a noted free
thinker, joined the movement in 1891

and hat since become its most dis
tinguished representative. In 1908
Mrs. Besant discovered Jiddu Krish-
namurti, in India, and became con
vinced that he was to incarnate the
spirit of the World Teacher in his
next appearing. The belief runs that
all religions have their origins in a
•ingle source, the Great White
Brotherhood of adepts. Besides the
belief in the Mahatmas, the most dis
tinctive tenet of Theosophy is belief
in reincarnation. A separate organ
ization resulted when W. Q. Judge
withdrew from the convention in
Boston in 1895. Mrs. Katherine
Tingley later succeeded the Judge
as president of this branch, the
Universal Brotherhood and Theo-
sophical Society.
UNITY SCHOOL OF CHRISTIANITY.
Founded in 1889 at Kansas City,
Missouri, upon the inspiration of
Myrtle Fillmore and with the assist
ance of her husband, Charles Fill-
more. Mrs. Fillmore's illumination
came at the end of a long period of
family hard luck; she visualized
both prosperity and health, and both
came. The two started devoting all
their time to the printing of tracts
bearing the good news, and within a
few years an enormous organization
had grown up. Doctrine closely al
lied with that of Christian Science
and the New Thought, and it is
chiefly the business principles and the
enterprising work of the founders
that have given the Unity School
distinction. They teach that it is pos
sible to attain immortality in the
body, corresponding in that detail to
the House of David. Maintain ab
sent healing department and report
countless cures of every manner of
disease by prayer and pamphlets.
Literature said to reach more than
two million people annually. Have
recently purchased a farm near
Kansas City, where they propose to
establish an ideal community.
UVIVERSAMSM. This began with the ar
rival in Good Luck, New Hamp
shire, in 1770 of John Murray,
where he was recognized by Rev.
Thomas Potter as the preacher sent
by the Lord in answer to this prayer
and expectation. Murray became the
pillar apostle of American Univer-
salism. The belief was organized in
1803. In 1900 the General Conven
tion at Boston said that their belief
was: I. Universal Fatherhood of
God ; 2. The Spiritual authority and
leadership of His Son; 3. Trust
worthiness of the Bible as a revela
tion of God ; 4. Certainty of just
retribution for sin; 5. Final har
mony of all souls with God. This
last belief is the chief factor in their
creed. They hold that this life is
"the suburb of the life elysian," that
death is a necessary prelude to
immortal life, that all must pay for
sins, but that all will eventually be
reconciled with God. In 1920 650
societies had 58,566 communicants.
Boston and Chicago are centres for
headquarters.
YOOODA SAT-SANGA SOCIETY. Estab
lished in America in 1920 by the
Swami Yogananda, following his
visit to Boston as a delegate from
India to the International Congress
of Religions. He had previously es
tablished schools for teaching Yo-
goda—a system of attaining Cosmic
Consciousness and superabundant
vitality—in Ranchi, India. He found
American soil fertile for his doc
trine and headquarters were in
evitably moved to Los Angeles,
where he conducts correspondence
courses and long-distance healing
services. There are 10,000 students
of Yogoda with centres in ten
American cities. The Swami num
bers a host of famous persons among
his students, including Amelita
Galli-Curci, Countess Ilya Tolstoy,
the late Luther Burbank, and
others.
