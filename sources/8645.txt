Your article touched on some understanding I derived from my NDE.&nbsp;   The &nbsp;concept of soulmates or helpmates was something I came back  with although I &nbsp;thought it was an original idea unique to me.&nbsp;   I didn't talk about it for fear that I'd be ridiculed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The  concepts of interacting with karmic and dharmic helpers seem to be an &nbsp;instinctive  part of my life since my NDE.&nbsp;  I  seem to recognize and assimilate &nbsp;those core groups you mentioned and then  transcend them to move on.&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel I am able to do this by not forming  any lasting bonds with those I &nbsp;interact with.&nbsp;   After my NDE I considered myself restored to some primeval &nbsp;understanding  of my function in this world.&nbsp;  At that level any sort of relationship with a modern thinking  individual is impossible.&nbsp;  I  consider modern notions of sentimental attachment both a crutch and a liability  distracting and thereby preventing folks from facing the question of whether  what they are doing with their lives has any meaning.&nbsp;</o:p>   </p>  </body>
