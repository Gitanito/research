you
my name is Frederick Marshall Fox I was
born in White Plains New York 1938 I
served in the Navy from 1960 to 1965 on
active duty I was in the Vietnam War on
the USS Ticonderoga during the Gulf of
Tonkin incident and then I served three
years in the reserves and was recalled
for the Pueblo Crisis and I flew for the
airlines for 33 years with American
Airlines retired at age 60 flew as
flight engineer for a cargo company and
now I&#39;m enjoying retirement I retired as
a lieutenant my rankin was a lieutenant
and I was a nuclear weapons delivery
pilot so I had top-secret clearance
well as far as the Navy goes I was code
for pubs which was confidential
publications and communications officer
there was a publication called John up
146 echo which had a section which says
that you will not reveal any information
regarding UFO phenomenon under penalty
of $10,000 fine and ten years in jail so
they they were quite adamant about
whatever experiences you had you&#39;re not
to go public with it without their
permission the only experience that I
had in the military with a close
encounter of whatever type it was was
one night I flew attack planes the a4
Skyhawk and they&#39;d have us go out and do
play bogey so the CIC could vector the
fighters and everything I was at about
180 miles from the carry one night by
myself at about 20,000 feet when an
object showed up on my left side and it
didn&#39;t freak me out
I didn&#39;t have any hostile intent it was
just there observing me and I sort of
observed it and I came away with a very
peaceful feeling and I never said
anything to anybody until later in my
career were the airlines I found out a
fellow ship mate of mine had a similar
incident
I would say maybe 30 feet you know a
small Scout craft to man one man
whatever maybe he was an
intelligence-gathering disc I don&#39;t know
but it was well I was saucer shape yeah
it was saucer shape from what I could
ascertain twenty thirty feet in diameter
or we oh it was right off my wing I mean
it was there I could feel its presence
if anything it was it was protecting me
you know I&#39;m out there alone at night
180 miles from the carrier by myself and
it can be a little you know a little
anxious
of course this during their Vietnam war
than anything so you don&#39;t know what&#39;s
going on 1964 it was August or September
it just appeared
I mean I&#39;m there alone and all of a
sudden I&#39;m aware of something and I look
out and here it is and after observing
it and having this close encounter on
whatever level was taking place then it
just sort of disappeared it D
materialized
like a black shape in the black night
there were no lights or anything it was
no lights but there was a form there was
a form I suppose if there had been
lights it might have created a an
anxiety which maybe whomever was there
didn&#39;t want me to experience at the time
I mean it was what 24 at the time there
were events over the course of my career
where I observed classic saucer shaped
cigar-shaped objects places over
military installations white sands
Albuquerque the subject never came up
with air traffic control in any event I
would never have opened my mouth because
they were I think there was a captain
Pete Killian that&#39;s written about in
some of the UFO books that was a captain
with American Airlines back in the 50s
that evidently had a sighting and
testified before the Senate committees
and then there was another captain that
actually took a photograph of one office
wings and of course they were subject to
ridicule and everything and I didn&#39;t
want to go that direction so I never
reported anything to FAA or the military
a lot of pilots just didn&#39;t want to get
involved in this because of peer
pressure and ridicule and the secret has
been kept I happen to have friends from
Japan
that are very open the Japanese are very
open about this in fact I was put in
touch with the captain of the jail 747
freighter that had the close encounter
with that huge spherical UFO over
Anchorage Alaska I think that you
mentioned in your your talk that the FAA
was brought in on and etc etcetera of
course even he succumbed to peer
pressure and whatever and was relegated
to a desk job and training and insecure
you know obscurity
I had more sightings in the airlines
than I did in the military I had the one
episode the one encounter over in
Vietnam and that that was the only
sighting and anything I ever had that
I&#39;m aware of
okay most of my other sightings took
place either at night I will mention one
sighting that took place in January back
in the late 60s I was flying a night
freighter 74 from LA to Kennedy and it
was a crystal-clear night there was a
partial moon so you could see and I was
sitting in the right seat and I saw two
lights red lights singular non blinking
red lights like they were flying in
formation I saw them out to my front
right and I watched and this was about
30 degrees off my horizon and I&#39;m flying
at 37,000 feet so they&#39;re they&#39;re up
pretty high and they went from the
eastern horizon to the western horizon
in about three seconds that&#39;s pretty
that&#39;s pretty what they were I have no
idea in 1978 a friend of mine by the
name of F Lee Spiegel who worked for one
of the major radio networks in New York
evidently found out through information
he received aboard one of our flights
that I was particularly interested in
the UFO phenomenon and I was contacted
and asked to be an representative of the
airlines at the symposium for the
peaceful uses of outer space at the
United Nations in November of 1978
I have a very personal friend that was a
b24 pilot during World War two that got
into OSS and he was one of the first
people into Japan after the atomic bomb
was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki he
ended up on Project Blue Book section 13
which I believe was the top-secret
portion of that investigation at the
time he was a captain in the Air Force
he&#39;s in his late 70s now and he&#39;s still
being carried on active duty as a
captain I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s been paid
but if he&#39;s on active duty he should be
a three-star general would time in rank
and he should be paid and the whole
reason they kept him on active duty was
to keep his national security oath
active because of what he knew and there
are certain things that he will not talk
to me about because of that security
oath even though I had a top secret
clearance with the Navy and we&#39;re both
very interested in the same thing so I
find that very interesting for whatever
reason the government are those agencies
of government Dean necessary to protect
their agendas which obviously now aren&#39;t
our agendas
and based on the information that you
gave us here at this symposium I think
it&#39;s time for us to to act to to end
this Sharad and to take whatever steps
are necessary to ensure that the human
race evolves properly and you know can
enjoy the fruits of that evolution
