 This  journal  was the diminished rump of the journals devoted to Parsival Braun's Grail Order (Gral-Orden) (see the note under Christliche Theosophie).  It was edited, after the withdrawal of P. Ch. Martens and F.E. Baumann from the venture, by Karl Heise, a notable Swiss anti-Mason and Ariosophist who became the head of what was then called the "Free Grail Community," the loose organization of "Gralfreunde" (Grail-friends) who remained interested in self-improvement through the Grail legends after the failure of Braun's formal, ritualistic Gral-Ordens in the late 1920s.  It was published for the "brothers and sisters of the Grail Order as a guide on the Grail way to truth."  ZDB: Berlin SBB Haus Potsdamer Str; Halle/S UuLB; Leipzig DNB.
