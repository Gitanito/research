  		              		Experience Description   

    I was jumping off the top of a small dam into the river. I followed the example of some older boys who were doing it for fun. It was a dangerous and risky activity, but I thought I could do it successfully. My first few jumps off the dam were exhilarating. I just needed to be sure that I jumped out far enough to clear the cascade of water falling down from the dam. Otherwise, one could get pulled down under the water and pinned to the river bottom. Needless to say, I made too short of a jump, and fell into the cascading water. I was tumbled and pushed to the bottom of the river and pinned down flat by the water pressure. I tried to break free, but  was not strong enough.  I held my breath and thought to myself,  'This is it, I am going to die.' The moment I drew water into my lungs, I thought, 'Dying is so easy, only one breath-span between here and there.' It was soft,  like gossamer on a butterfly's wing.
  
  My life flashed before my eyes in rapid sequence, like flashcards or playing cards being ruffled quickly. All of my life moments, including the inconsequential moments as well as important instances.  They all came flooding through. From the red canvas of my tennis shoes, to  the wind and smell of the oak trees I loved to climb; everything I experienced was shown frame-by-frame in a part-second. I was suddenly pulled by many filaments located in the center of my chest. I went  forward like a kite of a string, down through a tunnel or wormhole. I went extremely fast, like a  bottle rocket - whoosh! I was flying toward a bright light at the end of the tunnel. 

  Then I was standing in bare feet on river sand. I was standing on the edge of a great river which flowed from left to right. It looked to be a couple of miles wide. Behind me were stabilized dunes with willow and alder trees, intermittently spaced along the rivers edge. There was grass in the dunes. I first looked for the sun, but found nothing that provided a light source for the daylight conditions. I then looked across the river, to see such an amazing  world of mountains, trees, waterfalls, exotic flowers. Everywhere was  green, green, green! It looked like our own natural world, but on steroids. There was so much life with  colors, textures, light, and smells that were all in a state of absolute perfection and abundance. I could scarcely take it in.

  Then whoooooooosh! I felt myself being pulled behind by the same filaments between my shoulder blades back through the wornhole. I found myself being resuscitated at the rivers edge. A couple of teenage boys had jumped into the water, found me, and pulled me out.

  At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   I experienced a duplication of this NDE with my grandmother's passing. We had a Shared NDE.

  It was in June 1989. I was working in mineral exploration as a biogeochemist and soil microbiologist. I had finished my lab work a bit late, was in a hurry to get home, and dumped two vials of chemicals into the laboratory basin to get rid of them. A strong chemical reactive vapor rose up from the sink and hit me full on in the face. I immediately rinsed off my eyes and face in the laboratory emergency shower. I ended up having an allergic reaction to the vapor which resulted in my eyes being swollen shut.
  
  Thank goodness the next day was Saturday. I was unable to do much around the house, so I lay down on the couch with ice packs over my eyes to reduce the swelling. My partner was in the room with me when I was doing this. As I lay on the couch, images began to flow into my mind. The creak of the kitchen, metal-cabinet door at my grandmother's house would creak everytime she went to open it. I saw a bare spot on the carpet inside her front door, and saw her watering pansies in her back yard. I remember telling my partner that I thought I was dying since it appeared that my life was beginning to flash before my eyes like in the NDE as a teenager. I even asked her, 'Am I dying?' She said, 'No', that she didn't think so.  
  
  With that feedback, I began to look more closely at the images flashing through my brain. Although they were familiar, I could recognize that they were not particularly mine. I told my partner, ' I think these pictures belong to my Grandmother.' She  said, 'We should check the time.'  We wrote it down as  11:26 am. Immediately after that, I felt pulled by my solar plexus filaments, into the wormhole and toward the light. It all looked and felt exactly like what  had happened before. I felt calm and curious, but was wondering what was happening.
  
    Whoooooooosh! I landed with my feet in wet river sand, barefoot again. Right back where I had visited before. 'Whoa!' was the only thought that came to mind. My senses were operating at a high level of sensitivity. The color of blue in the sky was robin's egg blue, and it was so crisp and clear. The sky was the  bluest of all blues. I could see each  grain of the sand with such  clarity. I could smell the acrid scent of leaves and saw small debris floating in the water. I heard the breeze rustle through the grass on the dune, as clear as sandpaper rubbing against a chalk board. Everything seemed alive, full of the energy of life, bursting the seams in abundance, wellness and potency. Again, I was  facing the river. 
  
I heard heavy sobbing off to my right and saw my grandmother crumpled on the ground in the sand at the river's edge. I knew what was wrong, she had always been terrified of water her entire life.  'Grandma, Grandma, can you hear me? Can you hear me?' I asked as I gently went to touch her left shoulder. 'Grandma, it's Barbara. Barbara. do you remember me?' She was inconsolable and continued to weep. I placed my arm around her shoulders and whispered to her, 'The water is not deep Grandma. It's only an illusion, it barely comes up to your ankles.' She continued to weep.  
  
  As I was holding her, a young man about the age of 16 came running over the dunes toward us. He had on long swimming trunks with a towel over his shoulder. He stopped short when he saw us and asked if he could help. I told him the problem. He placed his hand on her right shoulder and asked if it was true that she was afraid of the water. She looked at him and said, 'Yes.' He returned her gaze and said, 'Camille, l'm here to help you. Let's do this together.' She looked at him again, and you could see wonder ripple across her face. 'Clinton?' she asked. 'Yes,' he replied. It turned out to be my grandfather, her husband as a young man and her only love. He helped her up off  the ground, brushed her off, and they both stepped into the river together. At that moment, I was jerked back through the wormhole by the filaments between my shoulder blades.  I woke up on the couch and told my partner all about it.  
  
  One day later, I receive the call that my grandmother had died. I asked my sister the time of death. She replied,  '11:26 yesterday morning.' 

  I brought this story forward at my grandmother's wake and told them all about what I had seen and experienced. The room was dead silent. Then my mother smacked the table with her hand and said, 'Hot damn! I knew someone would catch the crossing. In our family someone always catches the crossing.' I never asked her about that comment, but she sure sounded familiar with other stories in her own family. I have not had this occur again, but I can see the landscape and the situation clearly in my memory as if it were yesterday.
