 Art, Science et Peuple.
 Par la Science, avec l'Art vers l'Homme meilleur
 1919
 Paris, France.  Language:  French.  Editor: Salvator Schiff.
 1/1, March 15, 1919, perhaps the only issue published.  This was the work of the disciples of the Mouvement Cosmique after the deaths of Max Theon and his wife.  The Mouvement was based on the visions of Madame Theon ("Una, high priestess of Pan, the Light God and Eros" who was born Mary Ware) under the guidance of her husband.  After the death of the Theons the organization in France was under the leadership of Louis “Themanlys” (Moyse) and his wife, Claire.  The journal carried contributions by Clair Themanlys, Eugene Blot (Claire's father), Pierre Lecomte de Nouy, Edme Goyard, Georged Leblanc, Doro Hahary and others, and was focused on the occult meaning of art.
