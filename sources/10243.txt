The cab was moving towards New Deli, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. My head was in the lap of my younger brother, he was trying me to awaken me but I was not able to do so.

I felt darkness, no horn, no traffic sound nothing. Just I was feeling very light, there was no pain, nothing and vomiting going on and I was not having any feeling for that.  My earlier life was coming to me in PowerPoint presentation type images. Then darkness, I was feeling free.

Finally, after six hours, I came to know that doctors had done banding, esophageal virus was the problem.

Then I continued the repeated banding for a year, then I became jaundiced after five years. I come to know the portal pressure is very much that's why CBD chunks. One surgery failed for this LR-shunt, now mesocaval shunt has been done and I am back on my job.

Many times, I feel, I will not live but I have NO FEAR because it will not be death, actually it will be a transfer of duties.
