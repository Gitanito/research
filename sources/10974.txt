Everything was going normally until the nurse injected something into my IV.
  				    
    Immediately I heard the loud alert on the heart monitor go off.  I suddenly saw everything become a light grey color. I felt as if I was not only lying down, but had the sensation that I was being pulled in a backwards motion. I didn't see anyone in particular. But the feeling that I had was of absolute peace. This lasted for some minutes, but I wouldn't be able to say how many minutes.      From seemingly nothing, I felt pulled backwards. 

As I opened my eyes, I noticed all of the nurses were super-attentive. They were looking at me as if something had almost happened.       My daughter was born safely and perfectly. I never had this type of experience again.
