  		              		Experience Description   

  I was about 6 weeks pregnant and knew there was something terribly wrong the day of the experience. I knew already there was a possibility that one of the embryos was in the fallopian tube. In the late afternoon, I began to projectile vomit and was experiencing abdominal pain that felt like what I imagine being stabbed would feel. When I arrived at the hospital, I aspirated on my vomit, but the nurses took care of that.  I seemed to feel a bit better. I was placed in an OB/GYN emergency room with another woman who was also experiencing an ectopic pregnancy. This room was equipped especially for women with pregnancy complications. While I was speaking to the other patient my abdominal pain was getting worse and more unbearable, so the other woman called for the nurse. A code team was called in and the last thing I remember was the doctor asking me, 'Are you going?' I then felt no pain, but it was more than that. I couldn't feel my body at all. 

  At that time I had been a traumatic amputee for 9 years and lived with chronic bone and nerve pain which I  always felt. 

  During the experience, there was no pain!  I felt like I was floating and free from any physical encumbrances. I was in a dark tunnel that had  a light at the end of it. I wanted to go towards that light. As I moved closer to the light, I could feel a sense of peace and love like I never had before. I knew I was close to death and it was okay.  I thought, 'I'm good and dying is okay.  I'm not afraid.' Then I started to think about my husband and one year-old son having to live without me.  But I believed my husband would do a good job raising our son and they would ultimately be all right. It was at that moment that  I felt myself being pulled back by force.  
  
  I was awake and heard everyone shouting and the lights in the room were too bright. I was so disappointed to be back and the pain I was feeling was again unbearable. The doctors rushed me to the operating room. They explained that I had suffered a fallopian tube rupture and  was bleeding internally. If they didn't perform surgery right away, I would die.

Before the experience, I believed God would meet me when I died. But I thought I would see him as though I had eyes.  Instead, I just felt Him and 'knew.'

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Moderate changes in my life.     I have been able to take care of dying relatives and am comfortable in discussing dying, faith and God, and the afterlife. Before this experience it made me very uncomfortable  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I believe I remember this event more accurately because I shared it with others very soon afterwards and many times over the years.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    The day afterward I shared it with my mother who was very shaken because she knew I was in danger, but didn't know how close to death I had been. Last year my mother passed away and during her last weeks of life she was afraid of dying, but we talked again about my experience which seemed to calm her and allowed her to accept what was happening to her. It gave her hope.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   I watched a talk show where people shared their experiences. I don't remember being impressed one way or the other by the stories.  

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.During the days and weeks afterward, my physicians talked to me about how sick I was and how close to death I came. During the experience I was well aware that I was dying and they confirmed it with specific information. I knew that an experience like that couldn't occur unless I was close to death.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     Since the experience I have read about other people's experience, and I have been with family during their illnesses and death.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No
