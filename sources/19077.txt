let&#39;s go out into space and look at our
planet world wars weapons of mass
destruction going into space in a
competitive way with the Soviet Union
degradation and destruction of our
environment our targeting of
extraterrestrial assets around the earth
and in space and successfully killing
many ETS and downing their spacecraft
the New York Times revealed the
existence of a secret government program
to investigate UFO site I have put a
briefing together for every president
since Bill Clinton this is the next big
thing that they want the public to be
afraid of
the national security state we&#39;re
constantly spinning this story that this
is a threat we must have American
dominance in space a concerted effort
between mainstream media social media
platforms and tech giants to say let&#39;s
gain control back of the narratives that
we require I think this is a national
security imperative we need to do things
so that the public will accept in blood
and treasure the sacrifice is needed to
have an interplanetary war unquote
we went out to Oracle and sure enough I
mean we did these protocols and you know
things started to appear it just
appeared it&#39;s got on the radar the
intelligence community and they knew
that we had come across the rosetta
stone of contacting and communicating
with interstellar civilizations and it
worked that is what started the
intelligence community coming after what
we were saying and doing and trying to
intercept it this is in fact cosmic
disobedience on a grand scale we&#39;re
gonna bypass the sociopaths in these
covert programs and do this directly
