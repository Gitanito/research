He has conducted multiple surveys on the prevalence of birth, pre-birth, intermission and past-life memories in children.

Ohkado1 was born on 12 September 1963 in the city of Ise in Mie Prefecture, Japan. He earned his baccalaureate in English studies from the Osaka University of foreign studies in 1986, his masters in English linguistics from Nagoya University in 1988, and his PhD in Liberal Arts from the University of Amsterdam in 2005.2

Though Ise is home to one of Japan’s greatest religious shrines, Ohkado’s parents rarely spoke of spiritual matters, and his father, a junior high school teacher, strongly advocated materialistic science. His son followed in that position until he started reading books on the meaning of life and death in response to family bereavements and other striking events, including one of his students joining the mass-murdering cult Aum Shinriko, and the Kobe child murders of 1997. &nbsp;

The book Value of Life by Iida Fumihiko introduced him to the study of reincarnation, near-death experiences (NDEs) and past-life regression. Ohkado found the evidence persuasive and resolved to pursue the research himself,3 struck by how little of it came from Japanese sources, and also unsatisfied by materialistic explanations for human linguistic ability.

Ohkado also has musical interests as a pop/rock singer, songwriter and guitarist. He has released three CDs (all available on amazon.co.jp) and some of his songs can be watched on his YouTube channel.) His song lyrics (all in Japanese) and some photos and videos can be seen on his website here.

He grew up with one younger brother and has a wife and two daughters.  Positions Held

Ohkado is currently a professor in the Department of Language and Cultures, Graduate School of Global Humanics, Department of General Education at Chubu University, Japan, having accepted the position in April 2011. Previously he has held other teaching positions at Chubu University and other institutions including Osaka Kyoiku University.

Ohkado has been a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Amsterdam, and the Division of Perceptual Studies, University of Virginia Medical School Department of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences, USA – the division originally headed by the pioneering reincarnation researcher Ian Stevenson – since March 2012.

He has also served with several Japanese organizations involved in postmortem survival research. At the International Society of Life Information Science, whose purpose is the scientific study of unexplained phenomena of mind, consciousness and spirit, he held the positions of director, managing director and member of the editorial board. He has also served the Society for Mind-Body Science as director and the Japan Medical Hypnosis Association as advisor.4  Reincarnation Research

Ohkado’s mainstream academic interest is linguistics, specifically concerning the English language and its history. Accordingly, for his first reincarnation investigation he sought out a case of xenoglossy (linguistic ability without apparent learning). In 2009, he discovered a Japanese housewife who, under hypnotic regression, remembered a past life in Nepal as a village chief. Several remembered facts were verified and with the aid of a native Nepali speaker she was found under hypnosis to be able to converse in Nepali (responsive xenoglossy).5

Subsequently Ohkado investigated and published several Japanese reincarnation cases including the historical case of Koyata Katsugoro, a young farmer’s son whose past-life memories were investigated by respected scholars in the early nineteenth century. Ohkado published a report of Katsugoro’s case in the Japanese publication Bouekifuu in 2011 and more recently in the Psi Encyclopedia here.

Ohkado published two international cases. One concerned Tomo, a young Japanese boy who recalled a life in ‘Edinbua’ (Edinburgh) and showed a striking ease in learning English; he also learned to read Latin characters before learning Japanese, and was heard singing along with the Carpenters’ song ‘Top of the World’.6 In the second, a young Japanese girl recalled a life in India and drew pictures of her past self wearing a bindi, the forehead marking worn by Hindu women.7 Samples of her drawings can be seen here.

In 2014, Ohkado published the results of an innovative experiment testing whether Burmese children who recalled lives as Japanese soldiers during the Japanese occupation of Burma really did have Japanese-looking facial features, as local people claimed. He had a group of Japanese subjects look at two sets of photographs, one set showing Burmese children with claimed non-Japanese past lives, and the others of Burmese children with claimed Japanese past lives. The subjects did indeed rate the latter as having features that looked more Japanese to a statistically significant degree.8

Ohkado has also explored same-family reincarnation cases, suicide cases and a case involving abortion.  Children’s Birth, Prebirth, Intermission and Past-Life Memories

Ohkado collaborated on several publications with Ikegawa Akira, a medical doctor who came across children with past-life memories while studying children’s prenatal memories. In their first report, they gave examples of children who described intermission memories but not past-life memories, suggesting that these be viewed within the larger context of birth, prebirth, intermission and past-life memories.9

Ohkado and Ikegawa published We Can Be Reborn in Japanese in 2015.

Independently, Ohkado published a paper in the Journal of Prenatal and Perinatal Psychology and Health on a large-scale internet survey he conducted with parents in Japan, in which he found a surprisingly high prevalence of children remembering birth, being in the womb, intermissions and past lives, in descending order.10  Near-Death Experiences

In a co-authored paper, Okhado and Bruce Greyson probed key differences between Japanese and Western near-death experiences with regard to the way experiencers interpreted and interacted with their visions of light and images of heaven, concluding that these were due to cultural factors. They also commented on the absence in Japanese cases of the life review. Okhado notes, however, that in a separate investigation he was told by several children of a ‘reflection room’, a dark space that spirits could voluntarily enter to contemplate their past actions.11

Ohkado also co-authored with Greyson a study comparing the scores of two groups of subjects&nbsp;‒ ones who underwent spontaneous NDEs versus ones who had death experiences while under hypnotic regression&nbsp;‒ on Greyson’s NDE scale, which measures depth of experience. Results showed the regression scores as comparable to the NDE scores and in fact higher than those from one NDE study, warranting further research. 12  Awards for Parapsychological Achievements
