so I I haven&#39;t been watching a lot of TV
shows but I have been watching movies
and I just saw this movie that I think
you&#39;ll really love called Close
Encounters of the fifth kind is that
like a super old one no it&#39;s not it&#39;s a
brand new documentary and it was just
released this in April so yeah I was
just released on Apple TV but it&#39;s all
about actually meditation and okay the
well technically it&#39;s about aliens but
you they talk about how you can have a
close encounter of the fifth time which
is the fifth of contact with aliens so
that the close encounters would be like
the first encounter would be like seeing
a UFO the second would be like some kind
of proof being left behind the third
encounter would be like like you have
some sort of interaction with the alien
the fourth cause like you&#39;re on board
you get abducted and then the fifth is
like human initiated contact with aliens
I found nuts right I love it I think
there&#39;s a correlation between you know
the shift in the Mayan calendar where it
was like where everyone said the world
was gonna end in 2012 but all that
people had like people had said for a
long time there was gonna be the shift
in consciousness but I really think that
was the beginning of it Jorund this
documentary is talking about that shift
of consciousness and I think that like
it&#39;s just also interesting that it was
one of the top viewed movies on an Apple
TV they give it from the top most
watched and I think this time right now
is forcing a lot of people to like look
within themselves and that consciousness
is totally shifting so I think you&#39;d
really like it and I want to hear your
thoughts so text me out okay yes maybe
tango it&#39;s cops Close Encounters of the
fifth kind yeah okay yeah
