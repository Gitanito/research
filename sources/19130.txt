my name is Charles L Brown better known
as Charlie Brown I&#39;m a retired
lieutenant colonel United States Air
Force I spent approximately 23 years in
military service and l seven years as a
senior Foreign Service
Officer in my career I spent about 15
years
abroad I started out as an enlisted man
in the Army in on the West Virginia
National Guard in the fall of
1939 en listed in the regular US Army in
the signal Corps in June of 1940 upon
graduation from high school started
training as a pilot in July of
1942 was commissioned as a a second
Lieutenant pilot in April of
43 trained as a B17 pilot aircraft
Commander went to
Europe arrived there early November of
1943 commenced combat as a B7 pilot on
uh 13 December
1943 flew my 29th and last complete
mission on the 11th of April
1944 combat during this period was very
fairly severe I just completed a survey
of my 31 attempts at missions and every
time we went into the air we had
235 casualties during those 31
missions and then we very fortunate to
complete
it fed aircraft around the United
Kingdom for two or three months came
back to the States&#39;s instructor pilot
volunteered for overseas again and then
went out to the Pacific as a c-54 pilot
flew into China Burma
India left to service December 45 one
year of college very bored back into the
army for a year went to Japan as a
military police officer and ended up
commanding a Counter Intelligence unit
out of the service in
1947 the fall in order to complete
College finish college in August of 49
recalled to active duty in October of
49 given a regular Air Force Commission
in early
1950 left active duty in the fall of
65 gave up my promotion to Colonel to
accept an appointment as a senior
Foreign Service Officer served seven
years with the agency for International
Development six of those seven years
being spent in Southeast Asia as a
regional inspector for the
agency
basically because of my Counter
Intelligence training and police work in
an outfit called office of special
investigations since I had one of the
few pilot trained
investigators I ended up investig doing
a lot of Investigations of aircraft
unusual aircraft accidents in which
sabotage was
suspected and as a consequence became
acquainted with some outstanding
scientist and worked with the air
technical Intelligence
Center on a project called
Grudge at that
time offic of special investigations was
a worldwide investigative unit in the
Air Force and were given the
responsibility of
investigating what became known as
unidentified flying
objects the title within the center was
Project Grudge my job was to the
district do5 of R Patterson we received
these worldwide
reports and my job was to hand carry
these reports over to the technical
center and coordin them coordinate them
with the project officer answer any
questions from an investigative
Viewpoint that I could assist
on and I did that for approximately 2
years until the fall of
1951 when I Left Right Patterson Colonel
Dunn was nice enough to give me a
two-page letter of appreciation for my
work with project
Grudge and so far as I know that is
certainly one of the early formal
recognitions of work of an Air Force
officer with project Grudge now the
behind the scenes efforts that could
have been going on
simultaneously fortunately I was not
privileged to but but I I did gain a
feeling in that many of the
investigations were never answered
normally in the investigative field you
have an allegation of something or in
the case of UFO a sighting let&#39;s say you
carry it through to its conclusion and a
result and in many of th those
instances although it&#39;s been a long time
ago I do know that there were no viable
scientific
results and as a consequence it
interested developed my interest or sort
of pequ my curiosity if you will
into the aspect of an unidentified
flying objects having spent several
hundred hours in the air at that
point uh I followed it throughout the
rest of my Air Force
career and in Tactical Air Command I was
a coordinator officer between the deputy
for intelligence and continental army
command which at that time had
responsible for the missile defense of
the United States and so there were two
or three instances in which I was called
over there well even though Langley was
very close to Port mon row normally my
Transit time even with one time with the
military police escort was still about
12 14 minutes and when an object is
moving a few thousand miles an hour 12
12 14 minutes is a tremendous amount
have lost time so I was never fortunate
enough to actually to see the actual
tracks but I do
remember speeds in excess of four to
5,000 miles an hour which uh were far in
excess of any known aircraft that we had
or any of the enemies and being an
intelligence officer one of my
responsibilities was to have at least a
rough idea of enemy capabilities and of
their equip equipment we flew into uh I
think it was Las Vegas NIS Air Force Bas
and another pilot and I were driving
aird and normally the sky out there is
either very bad or very clear and we
were coming up out of there and I
glanced up and the sky was totally clear
and an object went across from probably
Southwest to
Northeast and it Transit the entire
heaven looking at it from my right went
out of sight on the left in probably
less than 15 seconds it was moving at a
speed that I couldn&#39;t even begin to
calculate it was certainly no satellite
it was not a satellite orbit it it was a
controlled craft and things like that
some of the object reported were tracked
on
radar we had objects with four-way
confirmation ground visual ground radar
Airborne visual Airborne radar and so
far as I&#39;m concerned it don&#39;t get no
better than that you&#39;re not talking
about someone&#39;s
imagination and in the time frame I
heard so-called experts at the Air Force
brought in and one thing and another
from Swamp gas to things like that
anyone who flies for as a profession an
airline pilot private Air Force Army
Navy military whatever
you&#39;re exposed to literally hundreds of
objects in Flight that are not not
always clearly discernible but normally
there&#39;s a flight pattern that takes
place if it&#39;s an aircraft with wings and
the laws of aerodynamic Supply you don&#39;t
stop that thing and reverse it in an eye
blank of an eye and things like that did
occur it&#39;s I don&#39;t know it&#39;s sort of
strange but we send people people to
prison we send people to their death
because of eyewitness accounts of crimes
our legal
system is based on that to a large
degree yet in my following of unusual
area Phenom aerial phenomenon for the
past 50 years there seems to be some
reason to
discredit very viable and very reputable
Witnesses
when they say something is
unidentified well you show me the in
individual that can identify everything
in the
heavens and I will show you the second
coming just that simple because I don&#39;t
care how technically qualified you are
and for someone who is not
there to voice an opinion oh they saw
such and such and such and such every
time I see a special on UFOs
or unidentified phenomena you always
have experts and my question is where
when did they get off what was the stop
that dropped them that qualified them to
be experts and I have a real problem
with that I truly believe that phenomena
have been visiting this planet long
before project Grudge I think that
there&#39;s adequate evidence of it and the
more we learn about the planet the more
we learn how little we truly know and so
the advance of science is something that
has to keep evolving and we have to keep
learning and I get real
discouraged when I hear people they
think they know it if you will the old
expression is a
know-it-all when really all they are
doing is expressing their ignorance
without knowing it I do not I do not
remember much of that and I would do
very little in terms of of looking at
gun camera film for example photographs
I tried to to do rather well on but did
had you heard that they exist I had
every reason to believe they existed but
I also had reason to believe that the
gun camera film was handled very
carefully not for General OB obervations
President Truman who was a rather direct
individual they&#39;re they&#39;re violating
airspace over the White House and there
no question I&#39;ve seen radar
photographs of
organized flights of unidentified
objects balls of light if you will and
these were on radar ground visual ground
radar Airborne visual Airborne radar now
the Airborne visual strangely enough by
the time they get a couple Fighters down
there those things apparently
disappeared whenever they wanted to so
anyway back to the story so President
Truman gets involved he sees all of the
newspaper headlines and things he says I
want the man who&#39;s responsible for
investigating these things so I think
General John Samford was a Air Force
assistant chief of staff intelligence so
someone said well General Samford is the
chief of Air Force intelligence
so President Truman said is he the guy
that&#39;s responsible for it well they said
well yes sir overall but he said is he
handling the investigation they said no
sir that would be a man out of right P
he said that&#39;s the man I want to brief
me so I do know that they flew Ed to
Washington while I was there they were
having a NATO exercise out in the North
Sea
area and a couple of these little
friendly balls of light
they were having night Landings carry
Landings and they got into the traffic
pattern well you can imagine what
happened when they came down on the Flew
Over the deck without Landing needless
to say and it threw the Navy into
absolute consternation as you can
imagine well the newspapers picked it up
and they were those days able to talk to
the sailors and the Airmen involved and
anyway
everyone screaming for an investigation
they say we have no investigative agency
blah
blah well to make a long story short
some years later the group Captain I
worked for retired as an air viice
marshal and I ran into
him and uh out and he was air officer
commanding at that time was near
Commodore in Singapore or in uh Hong
Kong anyway we were talking about it and
I had been told
by a former I think it was a Police
Inspector who went from London out
there and working for the Hong Kong
police and he
said that the UK agency investigating
UFOs was one floor above me in the same
building that I worked in for three and
a half years and yet they did not admit
its existence uh this is just the tip of
the iceberg because some of the very
unusual sightings were in the UK and
they were talking about the uh little
Foo Fighters that were over
Germany and the ger stra see the Germans
thought they were ours and we thought
they were Germans now in the real
world balls of
light do not have a place being Guided
by an
Intelligence being airborne and causing
consternation or playing games and this
they have been known to do I.E the the
Royal Navy and I looked up and directly
across the street to the South I see 11
balls of light they look like Windows in
an aircraft and all of a sudden my mind
is working a mile a minute no they&#39;re
round aircraft windows are not round
then they wouldn&#39;t be that large we had
five on top of
six moving at a very nominal speed maybe
3 or 400 miles
hour and I just started to say something
to my friend look at that whatever it
is and they turned off they appeared and
they disappeared I was looking at the
point in the sky when they
appeared they
disappeared so what do you do with it so
far as I&#39;m concerned that is totally
inexplicable
based on my judgment my background and
my research they are from someplace
else I do know
that there are agencies of our
government that can
manipulate data if you will
images and particularly in the last 20
near 30
years with the Advent of such as I&#39;m
speaking into this beautiful digital
camera you can create or
recreate my fascination with UFOs is
based on my
belief that
craft intelligently operated
craft that basically violated our laws
on this planet our physical laws
and they have done that for a long
time the fact that the
government at this point I know we&#39;ve
been investigating since
1947 has not come up with an
answer to
me indicates that there&#39;s something
seriously
wrong are we this incompetent in
science I don&#39;t think so are we this
incompetent in intelligence I know we&#39;re
not this incompetent in
intelligence now the image put
out Project Blue Book when it was
closed by Dr condon&#39;s
group I have every reason to believe
that this was a total deliberate
whitewash and uh my judgment is that
there&#39;s an excellent
chance that
elements of the United States government
for reasons
unknown have failed to advise the
public of everything that has
transpired investigation of UFOs I
believe that they have been investigated
for an extended period of
time and that the general
public is not being made aware fully
aware bits and
pieces programmed responses and things
like that so it&#39;s strange that you
should be interviewing me in an prior to
a national election because all you have
to do is turn on a television set or
listen to to a
radio and you hear and see the
results of professional programming we
make Blind Men see
and injured people walk and things like
that and uh we make people
talk in a certain fashion and we give
them intelligence
and we we can we can do a lot of things
we can also hide a lot of things I knew
from engineering manuals and from
research done at MIT that if you went
from totally dry air to totally
saturated air you should improve the
efficiency of an engine by about
2% well by humidifying air at that time
I thought it was all I was doing I was
getting 20 30% Improvement in the
efficiency of an internal combustion
engine engineering people and scientists
just wouldn&#39;t believe it so I&#39;m going
ahead not KN better I started selling
telling them well some strange things
started to happen and government
agencies moved in and uh particularly
the Federal Trade
Commission uh EPA was satisfied but no
government
support fined the administrator of EPA
had asked the director of their research
lab in North Carolina if he would if I
ever showed up if he would work with me
so I showed up without knowing that he
had called
it with a diesel vehicle
very spectacular results in that so far
as I know it was the first diesel ever
tested in a United States EPA laboratory
that simultaneously reduced all aspects
of measured diesel
emissions plus improved fuel economy up
to
23% so far as I know no one has ever
equaled it
the Federal Trade
Commission
had performed
literally an illegal
act the statement precise statement made
to the attorney for a large dealer in
Washington was we without identifying
we don&#39;t
care whether it works or not we just
don&#39;t want people buying these large
American
CS I could not when I got that report I
couldn&#39;t imagine an officer of the
United States government this is
19798 saying that I flew to
Washington went into the congress met
the general counsel he questioned me at
length I had
documentation he then said they would
act on
that when I pointed out the unfairness
of the FTC aspect by
documentation he wrote a skating letter
to the chairman of the Federal Trade
Commission sent me a copy of it within
three weeks from that date I lost my
vehicle about $100,000 worth of
equipment a test vehicle
stolen I had sponsored the US Army race
team on a little sprite racing car they
stole my unit off of that car after we
had just won the
thing the captain of the army race team
was a master sergeant in the Army we had
created a super
car and they stole that car from the US
Army in Van ni California so in three
weeks psychologically I was wiped out
this is no longer just talk there&#39;s a
real world out there and as one who had
engaged in been in around the combat
zone nine years of my life to have to
come back to this and 15 years abroad it
it was quite
traumatic so finally after a project
that I went into with the maritime
Administration which was very
successful the conclusion was I could
either add I modified one engine on a
towboat push towboat I could either add
20% in Horsepower or 20% in fuel
reduction at the same time simultaneous
with reducing emissions by
40% near the end of the project 2 months
before
mayad said our agreement&#39;s off we&#39;re
going to cancel the project and I said
you can&#39;t do this we&#39;ve done
it I said well I&#39;m going to finish the
project the agreement was 5050 I paid
for the last two months of the
test at this point when I finished the
project they said we don&#39;t want 50
copies we&#39;re not going to distribute it
we only want
10 not only that we want all of your
notes
and all of your
records I&#39;m saying you really don&#39;t have
a right to those yes we do we pay for so
you don&#39;t argue with the government so I
made copies of everything I had several
copies distributed them at various
points and sent them The Originals of
all of
this what I did not know at the time I
put in a call to the chief engineer who
would set up the project
was never available the number two
engineer was never available so I
finally called the
controller and he said they&#39;re no longer
with it I said what are you talking
about he said they have eliminated the
research
division of the maritime
Administration so someone did not
want this concept to be successful at
two minutes after midnight just into my
birthday
call come into my room I&#39;m just getting
ready for bed I gotten back from a
little restaurant
nearby please get out of your room sir
immediately and I said well if you tell
me who you are and why I&#39;ll get out well
this is the desk clerk and this poor
man&#39;s voice was breaking he said we&#39;ve
just got a call there&#39;s a bomb in your
room I said I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll discuss
this any further so I hung up went out
low Motel single thing by this time
they&#39;re evacuating the whole Motel
people get out 12:30 at this point in
the
night police come huge numbers and the
fire department and one thing another
and and so I said I&#39;ll check in to
Holiday In which I
did parked lighted area right in front
of the front just meet up old car I let
the outside go down but the mechanics of
it and I had several thousands of
dollars worth of equipment in next
morning quter to 7 I look out there&#39;s a
blank space where my car was that stolen
my car police recovered it two or three
weeks later uh all of my test equipment
I had built a prototype carburetor that
was the last time I ever did that I&#39;d
actually built the thing and uh
everything was gone and psychologically
again it sort of Zapped me so somebody
was following me my phone was
tapped no question about this there was
no logical reason for it my unit was
offered by this
dealer for
with every new American car truck or van
purchased I made that stipulation it had
to be American made my concept really I
truly believe I think I&#39;ve just opened a
door on a whole new field of science
this is not just my judgment but at
least three or four phds in in physics
chemistry and engineering and out of air
I make it more than just providing
oxygen for the combustion process there
are combustion stimulating molecules and
radicals generated in this
process thunderstorm in a
bottle my concept can work as a retrofit
item on older vehicles and people who
want to keep them but particularly on
the polluting major polluting Vehicles
which
are 18
wheelers diesel
automobiles the diesel diesel cars and
or buses and stuff in
cities uh towboats such things Oceano
vessels even I think the potential is
for power generating
plants based on Research done in
Europe in England and and by Max Blanc
and and Germany I have every reason to
believe it can be made to work on power
generating
plants you would not even see white
smoke coming out of
one I&#39;m 90% certain this can be made to
happen with a minimal
investment had at the beginning 25 years
ago the oil company&#39;s gotten fully
behind me and whatnot it might
extend the useful
life of existing oil on this planet
which is a finite source and they have
been using a substance called mtbe for
years and this now we&#39;re just learning
well we&#39;ve known for a long time but
early approval of
that was done without any logical
scientific base was done on a Wishful
basis let&#39;s do this and hope it doesn&#39;t
hurt well it hurts so anyway my
concept adds oxygen to the air among
other things everything it adds is an
oxidant it helps the
planet even CO2 when you use less fuel
CO2 is not a
controlled
emission but if I can reduce it by
20% that is going to help the ozone
layer all right the mixtures of various
gases including CO2 so so far as I know
it is probably the most fault-free
concept and in essence I was advised by
an agency of the United States
government a few years ago that if I
could do what I say I can do it was a
new field of science well I&#39;ve known
it&#39;s a new field of science since I can
find no Competitive Concepts it&#39;s
always confused if you will and I use
that&#39;s a polite term as a vapor injector
or a water
injector it is neither one of those I
have used it on a vehicle with a water
injector and with a vapor injector and
it still performs performs a function
that NE one of those perform so it is a
method of
enriching the combustion air or charge
air on any heat cycle engine I&#39;ve tested
on
propane limited testing extensive
multi-million mile testing on diesel and
gasoline I&#39;ve tested on gasoline from 75
to 125 octane I can run a vehicle that
normally requires 92 octane on 75 octane
without knock and perform and I have
done so for a period of three
months
so potential I&#39;ve just scratched the
surface they could not find any markings
on the
aircraft uh they could not find any uh
visible signs that the thing had wings a
tail Windows a
cockpit uh or anything like that or any
markings from any country I would
describe him as being
um
scared
