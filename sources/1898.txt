    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 	Word, The.
 A Monthly Journal of Reform.
 1872—1893  Monthly (irregular)
 Princeton, then Cambridge, then Princeton, MA.  Editor: Ezra Hervey Heywood and Angela Tilton Heywood, with occasional assistance from Benjamin R. Tucker.
 1/1, 1872-April 1893 (not published in 1891).

  This was, even by the standards of the time, a radical journal.  Heywood (1829-1893) was a spiritualist and a prolific writer on anarchism, free speech, abolition, the rights of labor, sexual and marriage liberation, socialism, and general reform.  He was most notably the author of Cupid’s Yokes, or, The Binding Forces of Conjugal Life: An Essay to Consider Some Moral and Physiological Phases of Love and Marriage, Wherein is Asserted the Natural Right and Necessity of Sexual Self-Government (Princeton,MA: Co-operative Publishing Company, n.d. [1876]), the pamphlet for selling which D.M. Bennett and Heywood were sent to jail, and which split the reform movement in the United States.  Contributions by, among others, J.K. Ingalls and Lois Waisbrooker.  Heywood was arrested at least five times for  his writings, the last time in 1890 for a series of articles by him and his wife in The Word on sexual subjects.  He died shortly after his release from jail.  NYPL.
