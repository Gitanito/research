PREFACE
My second book, and I am so hap
py to have it published. This story
was given to me by a well-known
screen star, who is now in Spirit.
I was inspired to write The Circle
April 9th, 1926. I wrote three chap
ters, then lost connection somehow.
I again was inspired November 3rd,
1926, and promptings came to me
rapidly and I soon finished my story.
I lost one poem and one sonnet; I
tried very hard to get them but could
not. I hope they are not lost forever,
and perchance this same kind spirit
may guide and inspire some other
girl, in another clime, to write to his
dictation the poems that are lost to
me.
I want you to like Donald, Dorothy
and Sylvia, my characters in The
Circle.

PROLOGUE
Rarely do we meet upon the Earth
Plane, the mate, so intended by the
Higher Power. So be it that each
and every one is always looking for
a thrill or sensation that would make
them complete.
The feeling that someone is miss
ing, makes them desirous to have
someone, sometimes a person not
even interested. For that one, too, is
after a mate, and is wildly chasing
another, and when they catch up to
them, after a hard run, they find all
their castles and desires in ashes.
*
THE CIRCLE
But to each and everyone, is a mate
—the forming of a perfect pair. This
mating is acknowledged as soon as
one sheds their earthly body. They
see a circle, and in it their beloved,
bright, lovely and happy.
To complete this current, many
wait years and years. Some are
thrown together in a short season
upon the earth plane, as with Donald
and Sylvia, our pair of the Circle.
10
Chapter I
BUDDING
To the little boy of yesterday
God bless this little man.
He knew each stick and stone and tree-
His mind was clean and his heart was
free
And before him laid the earth to span.
Let us turn back to yesterday,
when Donald was a boy of eleven,
serious, bright-eyed little fellow, who
sometimes wanted to be alone. His
dear little golden-haired sister, Dru-
cil, seemed a bore and a pest to him,
but he loved her.
11
THE CIRCLE
Adoration for his mother and fath
er, but, after obeying and loving
them as parents, he had no further
interest. Donald though, had a pal
in his grandfather. This great man
meant something in his small life.
Grandpa Clermont loved the out of
doors, and he lived a life such as we
seldom hear about. He hailed from
old England, was truthful, kind and
patient.
In his younger days, he was a great
Archer—proud of all this sport had
given him. He brought his beloved
bows to America. The cousins and
nephews that he left in England,
learned to shoot the bow and loved
their instructor. But his only son
12
THE CIRCLE
held no interest in this sport, so he
was much alone.
Then came the happy day, when
Donald asked his grandfather to make
him a bow and some arrows. Then
through the glasses of time, he saw
his own image in his grandchild and
was happy.
It was so promised that this gift
should be completed, on and for Don
ald's twelfth birthday. The days be
came very long ones to Donald,
seemed as though the joyous day
would never come. To Duke the
days were too short, he worked
hard and long and late into the night.
Time will pass, and Donald thanked
his father, mother and sister for
13
THE CIRCLE
their gifts to him, put them all care
fully away. Then with his bow and
arrow, he wandered into the garden.
Let us tell about Clemont's gar
den, for we may spend happy min
utes therein. It was spacious, with
sloping ground covered with a velvet
green carpet. Here many of their
friends met and put up their ten pins.
They would bowl for hours out there
on the green, you could hear the balls
as they broke into the pins and scat
tered them, then hear the peals of
laughter from the Scotch players.
Most of the neighbors were Scotch
and so was their game. It was called
"Bowling on the Green."
It was over this ground that Don
14
THE CIRCLE
aid wandered with his new toy. He
was too happy to want even Duke,
a name given his grandfather. A
wonderfully large tree stood at the
end of the garden, with spreading
branches and nice soft grass beneath.
Here, Donald comfortably settled
himself. He placed the bow and
arrow beside him so that he could
admire and pet them to his heart's
desire.
15
Chapter II
SWEET WILLIAM
A Spiritual pal of deep devotion—
Of a force so strongly given
That the very stars above them,
Smile as angels do in heaven.
While staring at his new posses
sion a queer thrill passed over him,
and there, right at his feet, was the
nicest little boy he had ever seen, a
boy just like himself. The queer part
to Donald was, he too, had a bow and
some arrows. Then sister came run
ning to him, to tell him they had com
pany, and his boy disappeared.
17
THE CIRCLE
Drucil had caused this, had taken
something from him, he knew.
"Shucks" was all he could say but it
meant a lot. And would this nice boy
come back , and just who would he
tell—anyway he would wait until to
morrow then go back and sit beneath
the same tree.
We will not dwell upon the time
spent with his little friends and sis
ter. Late that night Donald felt a
little pressure on his arm, rubbing
his eyes, he awoke and looked into
the face of his new friend. Donald
smiled a welcome, stretched out a
hand, then the boy disappeared.
Donald lay awake for a while to won
ii
THE CIRCLE
der just why this boy left him so
quickly.
To the tree he trudged next morn
ing, and to his surprise, found the
boy waiting. He arose as Donald
approached and strolled by his side,
they were soon engulfed in the woods.
Donald turned to the boy and said,
"My name is Donald—mother calls
me Don—"
The boy answered, "My
name is Billy but mother calls me
Sweet William." "I shall call you
Billy," said Donald, and so another
bond twined around them.
Then Duke was taken into their
confidence, and although he could
not see the little fellow, he felt the
thrill and knew he was there.
THE CIRCLE
The three spent years of happy
times together, shooting the bow and
taking long jaunts in the woods. But
now they were growing into precious
manhood and Duke was growing old.
Wonderful youths, these two, the
pride of Heaven and Earth ; and sis
ter was sweet and pretty to look up
on. Still, to Donald, a pest who could
and would not be serious, not even
for a day.
20
Chapter III
THE PARTING
It's lost, this day is done
But may it come again for me
And give me happiness,
Because I'll spend it, dear, with thee.
The splendor of it all—Donald
was to be twenty-one, and guests
were invited from far and near. The
old house was gone over with paint,
soap and water. Empty spots were
filled with new furniture, and flowers
were everywhere. Donald was happy
for this was his companion's birth
day, also, and it brought great joy to
11
THE CIRCLE
his heart. Well he knew that upon
this day something of importance
was to take place. He thought of
everything he wanted and knew most
of his wishes would be granted.
Donald just beamed on each and
everyone and smiled a great smile
into the eyes of each little girl, and
every heart beat fast, for they all
thought Donald a wondrous lad.
Donald slipped away and threw
himself beneath the same tree to wel
come Billy. Soon he was at his feet,
with a sweet smile, half sad. "Our
birthday," he was saying, "a great
day has passed Donald, a happy
day—but nothing lasts upon the
earth plane, and this grand compan
22
THE CIRCLE
ionship, love and understanding is
your foundation for a wonderful
future. Today I leave you, my pal—
for my mother tells me, that upon the
earth plane is my perfect love, my
vibration, my complete circle—I must
go to her, watch and wait, for soon
she will be with me. I shall come to
you again, years may pass, but I
promise to come and when you shall
need me most."
Donald's heart seemed to stand
still, never to see Billy again —could
he bear up under such a strain, this
world would be cold and empty with
out Billy But he knew he could not
wish or persuade when his dear Billy
2)
THE CIRCLE
had a great work to do, and Billy
would be happy in his new love.
Then he said, "Sweet William, I
shall miss you. I shall count the days
until your return, and though my
heart is sinking within me, I shall
think of you, dream of you, love you
always. I owe my perfect being, my
God-like thoughts, to your dear
spirit, to be guided by you through
these years. This guidance has giv
en to me a true understanding of all
things, after you leave me may I be
a brave, true and capable being. Let
us pull our bows, dear pal—and send
an arrow into the heart of that great
oak—there to remain until we meet
again."
24
THE CIRCLE
After they shot—then turned to
one another for a long last look, and
with the sad smile on his face Sweet
William disappeared.
25
Chapter IV
ALONE
Life would be a lonesome one
Through many, many years
Without his dear Sweet William
To share his sunshine and his tears.
For a long time Donald waited, he
knew not why, then strains of music
reached him, they seemed to call to
him, so he walked slowly to the
house. He just can't remember how
his tortured heart bore up under the
strain, the chattering, dancing,
laughing youths made his sorrow
harder to bear. Next morning Don
27
THE CIRCLE
aid confided in his grandfather, and
the dear soul was sorry and tried to
comfort his darling — to him, Donald
was still a boy.
Together, Donald and Duke, went
for long walks, hesitating on familiar
spots, but Sweet William did not
appear. One day Duke said to Don
ald, "Suppose we change our scenery,
let us move westward for a year.
Uncle Robert would be very pleased
to have us with him and Aunt Bar
bara would love it. I feel strong and
would like to see the other side of
this country."
They laid their plans before his
mother and father, quite reluctantly
they gave their consent. So after a
28
THE CIRCLE
month of entertaining, packing and
saying "Good Byes," Duke and Don
ald left New York for the sunny
west.
29
Chapter V
ONWARD
An exciting trip to Donald, for this
was his first long trip. He made a
memorandum of every interesting
town, of the mountains, the valleys,
the rivers; he wrote how he enjoyed
his meals on the train and the berth
pleased him too—this he put in letter
form and mailed home. He bought
some little Indian dolls for Drucil, a
shawl for his mother and a pair of
moccasins for his father, and Duke
enjoyed the paying for them. Four
days and four nights and then they
31
THE CIRCLE
arrived at a little station in South
ern California called Vermont.
With bag and baggage they waited
on the platform in a heavy rain
storm, it poured and the lightning
was piercing, it thundered, and Don
ald thought this an omen—for it sel
dom rained in California, that is, in
the southern part. This rain came
straight down with no wind to drive
it. He made his fears known to his
grandfather.
They waited but a few minutes,
when a man called their names. It
was the house butler, driver, pro
tector and chief counsellor to his
uncle, Robert Sawyer. Donald made
his Duke comfortable in the back seat
32
THE CIRCLE
with some of the grips, suit-cases,
bows and what not, then he climbed
in with the driver. By this time it not
only rained, but a mist came up, and
between the two, the driver had all
he could do to see the way—however
he told them the roads were not dan
gerous.
Donald peered ahead, and in front
of him stood a figure signalling for
him to go back —he asked the driver
to stop—the kind man obeyed and
Donald explained. "I have no belief
in such things but I will take another
road, for there is a small bridge
ahead and I will follow your hunch."
It so happened that the bridge was
no more. And so the wet drive ended
33
THE CIRCLE
and Donald found himself in a warm,
lighted room, and aunt Barbara kiss
ing his cold cheek and welcoming him
in a loving manner. She was almost
draped in a big, soft, wool shawl
which clung to his buttons when she
walked away.
"A good sign, Donald, it means a
strong tie of affection and I have al
ways wanted a big boy to love, cher
ish and deal out advice to."
She was sitting now in an old
chintz covered chair — Donald
thought her a picture, for she was
quite old and dainty and her hair was
the whitest ever. Duke was busy
talking and together they enjoyed
living in the long ago.
34
THE CIRCLE
An old darky drawled out from
the kitchen, that she had made ready
the lunch —though almost midnight,
these good souls knew their guests
would be hungry. They had a bowl
of milk and some crackers, while
Duke and Donald ate quite a hearty
meal. Then goodnight and to bed—
the pair were so tired they were soon
fast asleep.
35
Chapter VI
PANSLET
Next morning Donald pushed aside
the heavy net curtains. The sky was
strewn with little fleeting clouds,
through which an orange sun shone
brightly and encouragingly, then he
lowered his eyes to the garden, there
was a feast to behold. Flowers of all
colors, a little fountain in the center
of blooming shrubs, and sweet mag
nolia trees. He called to Duke and
together they looked long upon this
garden and knew they were going to
love it.
37
THE CIRCLE
Donald then took stock of his
room, it all carried comfort. It was
large, with a wall-tinting of gray, a
pink ceiling and a mixed carpet, the
furniture was oak and strongly built,
but the thing that pleased Donald
most, was the nice roomy closet and
desk, for his use. Let us look into the
adjoining room, the one for Duke's
comfort. A bed of walnut, with cov
erings, pillows and quilts soft as
down, all made in the long ago. Hand
made rugs upon the floor and two
great chairs to read and rest in. A
large bay-window where Duke could
sit and view a tennis court, garden
path, artistic benches and a summer
house, all belonging to a neighbor.
THE CIRCLE
Duke chuckled to himself at the
idea of having the company of
Robert. Pleasant morning greetings,
a tasty breakfast, and Donald felt at
home and acquainted. Ben Lloyd,
the chauffeur, butler and advisor, sat
at the same table, in fact he was part
of the family. The old darkey's name
was Hannah, and her hot biscuits and
fried chicken held the world's record,
at least in this little world called
"Panslet" —the name given to the
estate of Sawyer.
Donald strolled about the grounds
and found, to his delight, a place to
plant his target. This bit of delight
he immediately carried to Duke, and
these two started to work and in a
39
THE CIRCLE
short time were ready to try their
bows. Uncle Bob was an interested
spectator and wanted to learn to
shoot the bow. Here was a new joy
for Duke. Donald was fast losing
his Duke to his uncle Bob, so he was
left much alone.
40
Chapter VII
SYLVIA
My dearest phantom of delight,
When first she gleamed upon my sight;
A lovely vibration sent
To be a moment's ornament;
Her eyes as stars of twilight fair,
Like twilight, too, her dusky hair ;
But all things else about her drawn
From moonbeams to the cheerful dawn ;
A dreamy shape, an image gay,
To haunt, to startle and waylay.
And so he became moody, sitting
thus one night, he heard his name
spoken, and at his feet upon a tuffet
sat Sweet William. This recalled the
first time, when as a boy, he saw
41
THE CIRCLE
Billy at his feet. "I have some news
for you, Donald—your dear mate is
over here—and I am going to bring
her to you—have you see her, know
her and love her." Donald said it
was time he was having a mate of
some kind, and for the first time he
became homesick.
"Then, Dear Donald," said Billy,
"let me bring to you, Sylvia—the life
and joy of the spirit world." Then, be
fore him, stood a living spirit, as
clear and bright as an earth being—
with dark hair all waved in ringlets,
dark eyes that were brown and vel
vety, and an artistic nose, mouth and
chin. Donald, being an artist, saw
42
THE CIRCLE
the beauty and picture of it all—for
love had not entered his heart.
She beamed upon him, this Sylvia,
she came close and touched his hair,
his eyes and his hands. Thrilled from
his head to his feet, Donald dropped
upon his knees—he wanted to kiss
her gown, but it was so spiritual, he
could not feel it.
Sweet William stood by, with the
air of a man that has just accom
plished a great deed. Sylvia disap
peared and Donald relaxed and
smiled, and was again alone. He was
made happy, for had not he seen
Billy again, and seen Sylvia; but,
mused Donald, it would be far nicer
to have a mate upon the earth than
43
THE CIRCLE
one that one cannot touch, but he
wished her to come again. He in
tended to watch for her, as he had
for Billy beneath the tree. And she
did come again and again, their meet
ings became part of the routine of
the day, and Donald looked forward
to them with a great joy.
44
Chapter VIII
THE ARTISTS' CLUB
This litttle town of Vermont boast
ed of an exclusive Artists' Club, so
with the help of Uncle Bob and his
friends, Donald became a member—
all men of high standing and acknowl
edged artists were members of this
club. With his easel and paints, Don
ald went on locations and loved the
work, and so was inspired by a Spirit
Artist named Jerome Nowattny,
who had been a professor of art for
years upon the earth plane. With
his coaching, Donald's work was un
45
THE CIRCLE
dergoing a change—life grew into
the things he painted, birds seemed
to fly—flowers to bloom, and brooks
to ripple. All this, with his beloved
bow, and the visits of Sylvia, made
Donald's life a living joy.
Invitations were extended to the
members of the Artists' Club to
spend a few days on the outskirts of
San Francisco. A wealthy member
had a large estate there, he was a Jap
artist—the estate covered acres. All
the architecture was Japanese—sum
mer houses, benches, bridges and
gardens —all food for the brush.
Donald painted so fast his wrist
ached, his eyes took in more than he
could accomplish. At night they
4«
THE CIRCLE
were entertained in the heart of San
Francisco. Donald was as though in
a dream, for this Japanese element
pleased his artistic soul and for so
short a time allotted—Donald saw
and tasted his way into another
world.
Leaving the night's entertainment,
Donald spied a little Jap boy standing
on the curb, crying as though his
heart would break. He went over to
the boy and to his surprise found he
could speak English, that his parents
were dead and he, poor chap, belong-
to nobody. Donald liked the boy, and
encouraged by his friends, took him
along. When Donald arrived home
he was greeted with looks of sur
47
THE CIRCLE
prise, for all eyes were riveted upon
his little ragged Jap.
Within a week Donald changed the
ragamuffin into a little prince; he
got him a dark red uniform and in
this outfit he looked quite wise and
pert. Donald was pleased with this
unique little heathen and he took him
entirely into his service. He carried
the easel and oil box when Donald
painted, and occupied the back seat
of the car.
During his day-time walks, the boy
was ever at his heels, and would
bring the arrows from the target.
This strong, subtle little creature
would play upon a funny little instru
ment given to him by the Jap artist—
this wierd music fascinated Donald at
43
THE CIRCLE
times, but when he played too often
or too long Donald would ask him to
stop—then he would look hurt and
slyly sneak away and hide.
49
I

Chapter IX
THE SURPRISE
Donald returned one evening from
a hike in the woods, whistled a tune
to Hannah a warning of hunger. He
could see the wavering glare of the
log fire in the drawing-room. With
his hand on the drawing-room door,
he paused, it seemed as if some actual
force was urging him not to enter.
As if by impulse he thrust the door
wide open and went rushing into the
room, there, before the fire, stood
what he thought was Sylvia. The
figure came toward him with out
51
THE CIRCLE
stretched hand and a sweet voice
said, "So you are Donald — I am
Dorothy Lane—I live next door."
Donald took the hand, a material
hand full of earthly vibration.
He shut his eyes, fearing abso
lutely to look at her. "Is the fire too
bright for your eyes, Donald?" "I
heard so much about you and you so
resemble a loved one that you start
led me as I have never been startled
before." Donald excused himself and
left her to dress for dinner—seemed
but a few moments when he re-en
tered the room.
He is handsome, thought Dorothy,
but not broad enough shouldered, and
he is too tall—fine nose and loving
52
THE CIRCLE
mouth —lots of will-power. Donald
seemed ill at little sullen—and
his answers to her questions were
short. Poor Donald, 'twas the like
ness between this Dorothy Lane and
his Sylva that hurt him. Each gest
ure, figure and face were all identi
cal, the high, modelled forehead—
eyes of darkest pools—what trick
was nature playing upon him.
Dorothy was delightful, frank and
and original, in a word—but Donald
was overcome by the great likeness.
When Dorothy took leave, he walked
with her to her home, she invited him
to visit her next day.
He kept his tryst with Sylvia—his
soul-mate. This night she seemed
53
THE CIRCLE
more beautiful than ever before. He
feasted his eyes upon her, she looked
grieved and Donald inquired, "What
is it Sylvia? Is it because of Doro
thy?" She nodded her head and left
him.
Next day Donald did not go to visit
Dorothy —for the sad look upon the
face of Sylvia remained with him all
day.
And so a week had passed and
Donald worked very hard, for he was
sending some of his pictures to an
art exhibit. His uncle Bob was
learning to pull the bow, although it
had taken him a long time, he never
grew tired, and in this he was re
si
THE CIRCLE
warded with a love from both Duke
and Donald.
One day Donald decided he wanted
to fish, and equipped with his fishing
tackle, he tramped through the
woods to a small brook, with Sam,
the Jap boy, right at his heels. He
tried to find a comfortable way to
sit, when he heard a gurgling laugh,
and there, perched upon some rocks,
sat Dorothy. "You remind me of a
cat, Donald, trying to find a softer
place on the pillow; help me down,
you great big man." Donald scam
pered to her rescue, and when her
hand touched his, he felt a thrill, the
blood mounted to his face, he grew
sullen, afraid he had betrayed his
55
THE CIRCLE
adorable Sylvia. Then he changed
his mood and acted much like an in
terested admirer. Dorothy seemed
to understand—for she asked him to
tell her of her double. Donald
frowned again, "Never mention her
to me," he said. "But," said Dorothy,
"I should so much like to know of
her, please tell me, is she someone
you left in the east, have you quar
relled?" "She has passed on, is in
Spirit World," said Donald.
The statement made Dorothy very
happy, for she liked Donald and did
not want him to be longing for a liv
ing love, she thought to try and have
him forget, have him interested in
herself. Had Donald taken her into
56
THE CIRCLE
his entire confidence, this thought
would never have transpired.
Donald just hated his being when
he caught himself taking side glan
ces at Dorothy —he did not want to
know how her hair curled around her
face—or to notice her classic profile,
or to see her trim little ankle. He
had to upbraid himself for he was en
joying all these things, he was sure—
and was Sylvia looking down from
above with that sad sweet smile still
on her face? He hoped she could not
see or know he was walking by Doro
thy's side. Dorothy gave Donald her
hand and looked wistfully up at him,
he looked past her dear head as if
in a dream.
57
Chapter X
THE AWAKENING
Do not grieve Dorothy, your
eyes are wet,
Let laughter come,
and tears forget—
Though heartaches now bring
you sorrow's tears
Smiles shall be yours
in future years;
To cry, my dear, is
Nature's own way,
Your time will come and
you will stay.
Dorothy walked slowly into the
house, she was in a love dream. She
went to her room —admired herself—
59
THE CIRCLE
pressed her face close to the mirror
so that her full warm lips pressed the
cold glass. "Foolish girl, Dorothy,
he doesn't love you." Then she fell
upon her knees and sobbed, "Love me
—me—love me—oh! God, make him
love me—she has gone —is dead, I tell
you, dead." She fell upon the floor
and writhed and sobbed until the
very walls vibrated with her ago
nized sobs. Tears fell thick and
fast, heated and smarted her face.
"Poor Dorothy," she cried, "poor
Dorothy." Then she stood upon her
feet, and reaching for her perfume,
she patted her hair, her shoulders,
and her bare arms with the soothing,
cooling odor, then she sank into a
to
THE CIRCLE
chair and tried to reason out this new
feeling that was upon her—her first
love, she wondered —did it come to
each and every one in this manner?
—finally darkness crept in upon her.
Next day Donald called at the Lane
home, he had tea with Dorothy and
her aunt. They put forth the best
china and the daintiest cakes, with
crystallized jam. He liked Dorothy's
aunt and liked being in Dorothy's
home. In fact he felt so jovial that,
for the first time he invited Dorothy
to try her hand at his beloved sport.
Dorothy's eyes just danced, she hug
ged and kissed her aunt to show how
the invitation had pleased her. They
were to meet next day at one o'clock.
61
THE CIRCLE
Donald made it known at home
that night, that Dorothy was to learn
to shoot the bow, he also mentioned
the time, and he would like also to
borrow uncle Bob's bow, for he prob
ably would not be playing at this
time. Duke and Uncle stole glances
at one another, adding a knowing
wink or two.
One o'clock and Dorothy was skip
ping across the green to Panslet.
Donald was waiting, he saw her com
ing, and when she drew near, he
blushed like a school boy. Hours
flew by, Dorothy was an apt pupil
and Donald a good teacher, so both
got along well together. They grew
warm and tired, and quit in time to
62
THE CIRCLE
dress for dinner. When they parted,
it was to be but a few hours, for they
were to meet again at twilight.
Happy day for Dorothy, she lived
every moment of it to the fullest.
Donald too, was glad, and as the sun
cast her golden rays on Dorothy,
Donald found a subject for his next
painting, he saw the clear cut feat
ures of the Madonna and now, in the
twilight, he told her of his desire and
begged her to model for him. Doro
thy was only too willing and wanted
to pinch herself to see if she were
dreaming.
So, thereafter, each day Dorothy
visited Panslet and posed for two
hours for the portrait, and each day
63

she would bring a box of lunch for
two; in this way enchanting hours
were spent and a glorious being was
transferred to the canvas. Dorothy
wore a pale lavender frock with the
daintiest of lace, and little bows of
ribbons were its trimming, she re
minded Donald of a violet, and angel,
or sea shell—each day he had a new
fancy.
After the two hours were spent on
the painting, they would go for a
stroll or shoot the bow, then a part
ing to meet at twilight, and into each
hour was woven the song of love.
One night Donald returned home,
after swinging on Dorothy's gate for
over an hour. Right in the doorway
64
THE CIRCLE
stood Sweet William, this was indeed
a joy for Donald. They walked in
the garden while Billy told of his
love and his happiness, and when he
was ready to leave his last words
were, "Donald, what of Sylvia?"
That night his happy heart turned
as to stone and he cried with pain,
he called Sylvia and begged her to
come to him, nothing but his own
voice echoed in his ears.
Dorothy was thrilled and her heart
was filled with ecstasy, she was glad,
then fell into the calm, peaceful sleep
of a tired child. Donald slept not,
he worried and fretted the entire
night. Finally he thought of going
to Duke, for he could bear his burden
65
THE CIRCLE
no longer—his dear grandfather,
half asleep, listened to the sad tale
between the living and the dead, his
heart went out to his boy—and he
would try to help him.
"Donald," he said, "we cannot live
with the dead, it was wonderful to
have Billy for a pal—but now that
you have grown into manhood, you
will want a wife, a home and children
to gladden your heart when you grow
old. Donald, suppose your father
had not married, what would my life
have been like, I lived again in you,
my dear. And Donald, Dorothy is
everything that is lovely and good,
and I know both your father and
mother would approve such a union
66
THE CIRCLE
and welcome Dorothy with parental
love. Be happy, dear child, upon the
earth plane, be brave, true to your
self and true to others, and you will
be happy in this world and in the
next." He patted Donald's hand,
assuring him that he was doing that
which was noble and good. In an
easier state of mind, Donald went
back to bed and the few hours that
were left, were filled with dreams of
Dorothy's portrait and orange blos
soms.
While painting Dorothy's portrait,
a few days later, he tilted her chin,
and in so doing, came in close con
tact, he put both arms about her and
kissed her many, many times as
67
THE CIRCLE
though he were starved and could
not release her. Dorothy just went
limp with joy, she freed herself from
his arms and flew homeward as fast
as she could, then to her room—
there, upon her knees, she thanked
God for the fulfillment of her great
desire.
Donald stood rooted to the spot
for a long time, he still could feel her
in his arms and he did not want to
move, just live those precious min
utes over and over again. He knew
Dorothy loved him and right here he
promised his gods to love, honor and
protect her, he would tell her so that
very night.
Chapter XI
TWILIGHT
Twilight, as love, may come and go,
Between the light and dark, 'twas
ever so,
In other years to those that pray
The wish to leave this earth, not stay
At Twilight.
Living, eating, drinking, then pay
At Twilight, the passing of the day,
Days come running their allotted span
That the Earth has made possible for
man
At Twilight.
And so we all shall have a way
When we will not tarry ev'n for a day,
With our life completed and soul-mate
found
Who shall say, we are earth bound
At Twilight.
69
THE CIRCLE
Twilight, their trysting time, but
this twilight was the best of all—
for Donald forgot there were two
worlds, he just lived in one, Doro
thy's world. He told his love story
over and over, and they sat for
hours, either holding hands or their
arms around each other, and the
great moon looked on and smiled.
They were in their own land of
dreams.
In their land of dreams,
Happy land of dreams,
As they sit hand in hand
And they both understand
How true it all seems;
Now the twilight is low,
Shadows come and go
70
THE CIRCLE
But the whole world is bright
For they are happy tonight
In the land of dreams.
Donald's brain was in a whirl—
he wanted to be married right now.
It was so hard to part.
When Donald woke upon the mor
row, he sought for Duke. He found
both Duke and Uncle Bob on the
range. Since Dorothy learned to
shoot the bow, Uncle Bob and Duke
gave up to the children, as they called
them, and found the early morning
hours the best for their sport.
Donald eagerly told them of his
engagement to Dorothy —this broke
up the game and all walked back
to the house as happy as bluebirds.
71
THE CIRCLE
Duke promised Donald to build a
love nest for them and Uncle Bob,
not to be outdone—gave him the
land to build it on. "Ah !" said Duke,
"his parents shall furnish the house."
In this way the morning passed too
quickly, spent in eager speculation
on the coming nuptial. At midday,
Aunt Barbara called them to lunch
—she was so happy, she beamed upon
Donald with mother love. Donald
then hastened to get busy on the
portrait of Dorothy —there was the
exhibit at Chicago to again think
about, dream of, and talk to Dorothy
about. So each touch of the brush
was a touch of loving care, a stroke
of beauty and of joy.

Chapter XII
PLANNING
"THE GARDEN"
Let us grow a garden like of old,
There is so many things to do
To place a fountain in its center
With shells, bird baths and songs for
you.
There will be blossoms on the trees,
Their perfume, to waft, and to hold
And many lovely things like these
With flowers gay, a picture to behold.
Donald intended drawing the plans
for his own home, this pleased
Dorothy, so instead of sitting in the
moonlight, one could look in the
THE CIRCLE
drawing room and see two eager
heads bending over great sheets of
paper, and soon upon it will grow a
house, a garden with flower beds and
a fountain. Lovely trees and benches
for lovers to sit upon, a bird bath
for little birds to drink at, bathe and
arrange their feathery clothes. Then
they sigh happy sighs of love and
contentment. It was on such a night
as this that Donald left Dorothy at
her gate—wandered home, and with
love's abandon, threw himself within
an easy chair to ponder over his new
found happiness.
Suddenly he felt cold, then warm,
then a sad fear gripped his heart,
for gliding into the room, came the
74
THE CIRCLE
glorious form of Sylvia. And stand
ing before Donald in all her radiance,
she looked at him sadly and yearn
ingly—"This cannot be, Donald."
She drew nearer and nearer, then
bending her graceful form over him,
she touched his brow, she kissed his
mouth and was gone.
Poor Donald, how hard was the
life of a seer, not to be able to choose
your bride —from the living or the
dead. In the days gone by, Donald
could carry burdens such as this to
Duke. But now that Duke was so
happy over his engagement to Doro
thy, he did not want to change this
condition, so Duke was permitted to
sleep in blissful ignorance. Donald
75
THE CIRCLE
had pledged his love to Dorothy and
he swore he would never cause her
one moment of regret.
Next day Donald decided to take
Dorothy into his confidence, tell her
of Sweet William and Sylvia. He
would relate each visit, he then went
over and lived through the past, of
the pleasure and the wonder of it all.
But when he saw Dorothy next day,
he could not tell her. Sylvia came
to Donald for three nights and stood
radiantly in the moonlight, an angel,
a lovely lady to behold. Donald
thought her more beautiful than ever
before, knew that he loved her and
was sorry and ashamed of his earth
ly love. He knelt before her, begging
76
THE CIRCLE
for forgiveness, his heart torn cruel
ly for love—the living power that
should make us more happy. Once
again she left a dewy Mss upon
his mouth and disappeared.
77
Chapter XIII
A TRIP IN THE NIGHT
'Tis love's sunshine sets the rivers free,
Rushing in torrents to the sea,
And in each morning's sunlight beam
'Tis love unlocks each frozen stream.
If warm or cold neglect be thine,
Fond love thaws out the wintry wind,
And o'er the hills and valleys fair
The sun warms out the winter's air.
Coldness in your heart cannot be long
When nature charms with love and song.
Love's sway alone may the heart unclose
Fragrant as the budding rose,
Within its heart the diamond dew
Refreshes its soul with life anew.
Donald could stand this strain no
longer, so he packed his grip and
went out into the night, he drove
79
THE CIRCLE
like mad. Early dawn found him
once more in San Francisco. He
drove to the Art Club, had breakfast,
put up his grips, then went out for
a walk. He walked for an hour or
more, he thought how unreasonable
this trip had been, he knew he was
sorrowful, he tried so hard to reason
why the lovely Dorothy should not
be his without hurting Sylvia so.
He called upon a few friends in
their studios, told in glowing words
of the portrait of Dorothy and that
he had a permit for the exhibition
at Chicago, and that it would be
finished soon. He told them of his
engagement and love for Dorothy,
of the plans of his home and of the
10
THE CIRCLE
gifts bestowed upon him by his
grandfather and Uncle Bob. He
promised to have dinner at the club
and attend a party at night, a hasty
affair to be given in his honor. For
he also told them he would leave
next day for Panslet.
Donald took a room at the club,
threw himself on the bed, his
thoughts flew homeward and he
wondered just how much anxiety
he was causing his Aunt, Uncle and
Duke, and also his beloved Dorothy.
He arose immediately and sent a
wire to Dorothy and explained he
would be home next night. Now
that this was attended to, Donald
si
THE CIRCLE
took forty winks, and awoke just in
time to dress for dinner.
Sorrow seemed to leave him and
once again he knew that Dorothy
was all that mattered, for was she
not a soul in the flesh, and he could
feel her very heart beats, and her
warm lips upon his mouth. He could
hold her fast in his arms and she
loved him, 'twas true, and beautiful
to look upon—he decided he was in
deed blest, and would not worry
again.
Donald made the best of his visit,
just as though it were all planned, he
was jovial, almost happy. Their
pleasure lasted until midnight and it
was a very tired Donald that climbed
82
THE CIRCLE
into bed. He fully intended to get an
early start next morning, but the sun
was streaming into his room at an
angle that told Donald it was past
nine o'clock.
He dressed hurriedly, breakfasted,
and started homeward. He arrived
at night. All were gathered in the
dining-room waiting his return —
anxious to know what took him away
from home in such a secretive man
ner. Donald would relate all to Duke
—but just now he could not explain—
he did say he went for a long walk
and bought this—and from a velvet
case, glistened the ring that was
to be placed on a third finger
of the shapely hand of Doro
13
THE CIRCLE
thy. All further inquiries were for
gotten. After Donald had dined,
they gathered about to chat. Donald
took Dorothy in his arms, kissed her
and placed the ring upon her finger.
The days following were devoted
to the portrait. Dorothy posed until
she was so exhausted she almost
went into a sleep during the sittings.
One day Dorothy stepped back a few
paces to better admire the painting,
she looked long and hard at
it,
a
queer feeling passing through her
body, "Donald," she said, "those eyes
in the portrait seem different from
mine—
I
find
a
look of sadness that
I
did not see before." Donald noticed
it
too,
it
did seem different, "perhaps
84
THE CIRCLE
we are both tired and have become
blind to the painting; let us rest to
morrow, dear one, or have a picnic
in the woods." The next day was a
day of love's abandon, idleness and
pleasure. Dorothy danced, ran, and
loved to her heart's content; never,
never would she forget this day—and
she must have something for her
treasure box. "Donald dear, let me
have a curl from your head—I want
it to place with a sprig of Rosemary
—for sweet remembrance."
The curl still remained upon Don
ald's head until they sat side by side
in the living room of the Lanes'.
Dorothy opened her sewing basket,
took from it a tiny pair of scissors,
85
THE CIRCLE
then gathering a curl between her
fingers, she deftly cut it off. She
pressed it to her lips, she could not
tell why, but tears fell softly upon
the head of Donald. And when he
discovered more in her eyes, he kiss
ed them all away. Dorothy thought
they were tears of happiness. So
they petted and cooed as all lovers do,
until they had to part, until the mor
row.
96
Chapter XIV
A TEAR
Donald was tired and fell into a
deep slumber in which he had a
dream, he saw Dorothy running to
wards him, he gathered her in his
arms and when he wanted to kiss her
lips, he found them to be Sylvia's.
When he awoke in the morning, he
remembered this dream clearly.
Aunt Barbara beamed on him with
a motherly love, had a breakfast for
him fit for a king. She was happy to
have this nice boy with her and on
this day wished to tell him so. "What
17
THE CIRCLE
is
it,
Aunt Barbara," asked Donald,
"have you good news for me?" "Yes,
Donald,
I
have
a
letter from your
mother, they are all coming out here
to live and they will be here for the
wedding. They wanted so to sur
prise you, but
Iam too happy to keep
their secret, for, Donald dear,
I
was
so afraid that they would grow lone
some and wish their son to return to
them—that would leave me lonely,
for
I
have learned to love you."
Donald kissed his aunt and thanked
her for this great love, the happiness
she had given him, the comfort and
the cheer.
Donald hurried to his studio, un-
draped his painting, wiped his brush
81
THE CIRCLE
es, and while slipping into his smock,
glanced at the painting; truly he was
not blind to his work this morning—
but as he looked, he saw a tear fall
from the eye of the portrait. He
walked over to better examine
it,
it
was now part of the portrait, for
it
was painted on so naturally that
it
seemed as though
it
could be brushed
off. He wiped
it
out before Dorothy
could discover it. So tediously he
worked, until
it
was as before —
a
portrait of
a
lovely lady.
Dorothy came in with
a
smile on
her lips and
a
song in her heart, she
made many little exclamatory "Oh!
Oh's
!"
She loved this masterpiece of
Donald's and she told him so over and
89
THE CIRCLE
over. Then she posed and Donald
painted and the morning passed
quickly— they went over to Doro
thy's home for lunch then back to
work again—giving every minute in
the name of art. Donald wanted to
win a prize, he was eager and ex
pectant, both Dorothy and Donald
could talk of nothing else.
But sad foreboding thoughts crept
over Donald when he would think of
the dream and the tear on the canvas,
so real that no earthly artist could
have painted it. But youth and love
soon forget sorrow and Donald was
happy once again.
Next day Donald told Dorothy she
might rest. So, to make others
98
THE CIRCLE
happy, Dorothy joined Duke and Un
cle Bob at their sport, while Donald
remained at the studio to paint the
lovely lace upon the dress. He laid
the dress upon a chair and when he
would arrange
it,
he would caress
the folds and often touch his lips to
its softness. While working thus—
he felt
a
presence and Sylvia stood
near, the first time she had visited
him in the studio.
Donald greeted her, and in this
nervous state painted the portrait,
she looked long and piercingly, and
Donald was sure he heard
a
little
sigh, as she vanished from his sight.
He tried to be calm and work, but
not accomplishing anything, he
thought
it
best to leave and in
a
short
91
THE CIRCLE
time stood beside Dorothy, ready to
aim at his beloved target.
Donald had much to do upon the
dress, so he again offered Dorothy a
day of rest. He arranged the gar
ment as before and went eagerly
about his work, but in his mind this
arrangement did not please him, for
the folds of lace would not behave.
He plodded on, raised his head and
behold ! there sat Sylvia in the dress,
she nodded to him to continue his
work, and he did. He painted like a
mad man, and it grew, this lace
under his brush—such lace, such
folds, was ever an artist so inspired
and blessed before. And she, dear
Spirit, sat until it was finished —
92
THE CIRCLE
Donald walked forward to thank her,
but as he drew near, she left, leaving
the dress in a little heap upon the
throne.
Donald wanted so to confide in
someone, but he had lost Duke as his
right bower. He left the studio very
tired in mind and body and walked
slowly to the house. He went early
to bed that night, for on the morrow
he would finish the portrait.
Chapter XV
THE PORTRAIT
Dorothy was the first to enter the
studio on the morrow, she stood spell
bound, had ever a girl looked upon a
portrait of herself and found it so
wonderful —the dress was a surprise
to her, she could not admire it
enough—the meshes of lace looked
as though you could feel their fine
ness. Donald truly was a remark
able artist and lover too—thought
Dorothy. She was quite sure there
was no other like him. She grew
restless alone and finally wandered
95
THE CIRCLE
out to meet him—in her stroll she
soon reached the house, she called in
at the open door and Donald spied
her, drank in the love from her
laughing eyes. Dorothy told him of
her early hour at the studio and how
she praised the work on the dress,
how she adored her portrait, and she
just knew she could not be anything
but vain after looking at such a
canvas in all its splendor.
Arm in arm they returned to work
and within a few hours the portrait
was finished. The lovers stood gaz
ing, commenting, praising and wor
shipping the work before them. That
night they had a plan to invite
all the friends and neighbors that
»6
THE CIRCLE
were near to visit next day, at tea,
to see Donald's masterpiece. They
kept the phone busy for hours and
two very tired young people went to
bed and to peaceful slumbers.
Next morning everybody was
busy. The studio was made clean
and neat, chairs were brought in
from the Sawyers and the Lanes,
and the great tea urn was filled with
tea, cookies were baked—hearts were
made light with love and laughter.
Donald curtained his portrait with
great care, as he did this, he felt a
light touch on his arm—and to his
satisfied surprise—there stood Sweet
William. "Let us walk, dear Don
ald," —so out into the open they
97
THE CIRCLE
strolled, these two boys, one in the
spirit, the other a proud specimen of
early manhood. "So glad for your
return, Billy, I have no one to talk to
or confide in since you ceased to be
ever at my side, and you are happy
Billy dear, and you do like the por
trait of Dorothy?" He did not give
Sweet William a chance to answer.
But Sweet William was happy, he
also thought Dorothy lovely and
beautiful but could not understand
how Donald could prefer her to the
radiant Sylvia, knowing Sylvia was
his true soul-mate. Donald read
Billy's thoughts, then tried to explain
that he was an earth being, full of
youth and love. "But, dear Donald,
THE CIRCLE
I have a happy little surprise for you,
you shall be happy on earth and also
in Spirit World, this shall be the
fruit of my toil for my pal—it shall
be my gift to you—dearest Donald,"
and with this lovely message —Sweet
William left him.
That afternoon Dorothy came over,
all dressed in white, it startled
Donald for she looked so spiritually
pure and exactly like Sylvia. The
lawn was soon dotted with pretty
dresses of all hues and designs. Don
ald was kept busy showing his be
loved portrait and hearing honest,
friendly praise. Aunt Barbara too,
was busy, she poured the tea and
chatted like a magpie, for she was
99
THE CIRCLE
proud and filled with mother love.
This day ended all too soon for just
everyone.
Next day the house echoed with
happy voices for Donald's loved ones
had arrived. Donald showed them
the portrait and eagerly watched
their faces for approval and parent
al pride, he saw love light shining in
their eyes and knew that they loved
their son. They praised the beauty
of the girl model, his Dorothy. And
when they did meet Dorothy, their
hearts went out to her with a great
love.
The portrait was crated and soon
on its way to the exhibit in the Chi
cago Institute. Many will be the
1
100
THE CIRCLE
guides that will help Donald win
reognition and become a great artist
of fame and fortune.

Chapter XVI
UNITED SPIRITUAL FORCES
A month has passed, Dorothy and
Drucil had become fast friends, and
Donald's parents became her parents,
she won their love and was glad. It
was again the time when the full
moon shone from above. Donald and
Dorothy wended their way through
the garden and stopped beside the
fountain. Dorothy looked unusually
beautiful this night, her eyes were
star lit, her mouth seemed redder
than ever before. He was about to
take her in his arms, when, gliding
toward him, came Sylvia.
103
THE CIRCLE
Donald's heart stood still within
his body, his tongue became para
lyzed in his mouth, he could but stare
straight ahead of him. Dorothy did
not see, just stood as in a trance —
like some lovely sculptured figure—
slowly came the radiant Sylvia, she
seemed to rise above Dorothy, then
she melted into her being. Dorothy
was speaking and Donald tried to
hear —her voice seemed so far away.
I am so happy dear Donald, happier
than ever before,I feel as if some
burden has been lifted from my
heart. Then it all dawned upon him
—his Sylvia had mingled her spirit
with the life of Dorothy —she was
willing to share with her, one body,
104
THE CIRCLE
one heart and one man. Donald's
problem was solved through the love
of Sweet William.
We all do fade as a leaf—
The bodies that hold the soul,
Our lives on earth are but brief
Retarding the reach of our goal.
To know we live another day
On a plane near, and still far—
When we discard the house of clay
To walk through the door ajar.
Then is the day of wondrous life
With love and ecstasy for aye,
Without a care of storm or strife
We receive this greater pay,
To live forever and a day
In Spirit World.
FINIS.
