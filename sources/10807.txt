  		              		Experience Description:   

I ended up in the hospital with severe bleeding in my esophagus which needed to be operated on. I lost a lot of blood and my HV values were 6.2, where 17-21 is the norm. One night, I don't know which one, I saw myself floating in a very intense yet peaceful light and in that moment I had the feeling of complete peace, and absolute freedom in my soul. It was a sensation that is very difficult to describe - but it was very beautiful and ever since that moment I no longer fear death.
