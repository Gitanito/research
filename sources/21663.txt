RELIGION
D
ESTINY is determined, for na-
tions and for individuals, by
factors and forces that are
really fundamental-such as men's atti-
tude toward one another. Ideals and
motives are more potent than events in
shaping History. What people think
about the abiding concerns of life means
more than any contemporary agitation or
upheaval.
A few centuries ago it was thought
that we must choose between the Bible
and Galileo. Fifty years ago it was
thought that we must choose between
the Bible and Darwin, but as Dean W.
R. Inge, of St. Paul's Cathedral, Lon-
don, says: "Every educated man knows
that the main facts of organic evolution
599
'The ~w Psychology
are firmly established, and that they are
quite different from the legends bor-
rowed by the ancient Hebrews from the
Babylonians. We are not required to do
violence to our reason by rejecting the
assured results of modern research. Tra-
ditional Christianity must be simplified
and spiritualized. It is at present en-
cumbered by bad science and caricatured
by bad ec;onomics and the more con-
vinced we are of this, the less disposed
we shall be to stake the existence of our
faith on superstitions which are the re-
ligion of the irreligious and the science
of the unscientific."
Modern discontent and unsatisfactory
conditions are the symptoms of a deep
seated and destructive disease. Remedies
applied to these symptoms in the form
of legislation and suppression may re-
lieve the symptoms, but they do not cure
600
:R_digion
the disease which will manifest in other
and worse symptoms . Patches applied
to an old decaying and obsolete garment
in no way improve the garment. Con-
structive measures must be applied to the
foundations of our ,civilization and that
is our thought.
A philosophy of life having as its basis
blind optimism, a religion that won't
work seven days a week, or a proposi-
tion that isn't practical appeals to the
intelligent not at all. It is results that
we want and to all such the acid test is:
Will it work?
The apparent impossibilities are the
very things that help us to realize the
possible. We must go over the unbeaten
trail of thought, cross the desert of ig-
norance, wade through the "Swamp of
Superstition" and scale the mountains
of rites and ceremomes if we ever ex-
6or

pect to come into the "promised land of
revelation." Intelligence rules! Thought
intelligently directed is a creative force
which automatically causes its object to
manifest on a material plane. Let him
that hath an ear to hear, hear!
One of the characteristic signs of a
general awakening is the optimism shin-
ing through the midst of doubt and un-
rest. This optimism is taking the form
of illumination, and as the illumination
becomes general, fear, anger, doubt,
selfishness and greed pass away. We are
anticipating a more general realization
of the Truth which is to make men free.
That there may be one man or one
woman who shall first realize this Truth
in the new era is barely possible, but
the preponderance of evidence is for a
more general awakening to the light of
illumination.
602
'R!}igion
Everything which we hold in our con-
sciousness for any length of time becomes
impressed upon our subconsciousness and
so becomes a pattern which the creative
energy will weave into our life and en-
vironment. This is the secret of the
power of prayer.
The operation of this law · has been
known to a few in all ages, but nothing
was more improbable than the unauthor-
ized revelation of this information by
. any student of the great esoteric schools
of philosophy. This was true because
those in authority were afraid that an
unprepared public mind might not be
ready to make the proper use of the ex-
traordinary power which the application
of these principles disclosed.
We know that the universe is governed
by law; that for every effect there must
be a cause, and that the same cause,
603
:!he :J...&..,w
Psychology
under the same conditions, will invari-
ably produce the same effect. Conse-
quently, if prayer has ever been an-
swered, it will always be answered, if
the proper conditions are complied with.
This must necessarily be true; otherwise
the universe · would be a chaos instead
of a cosmos. The answer to prayer is
therefore subject to law, and this law is
definite, exact and scientific, just as are
the laws governing gravitation and elec-
tnc1ty. An understanding of this law
takes the foundation of Christianity out
of the realm of superstition and credulity
and places it upon the firm rock of sci-
entific understanding.
The Creative Principle of the Uni-
verse makes no exception, nor does it
act through caprice or from anger, jeal-
ousy or wrath; neither can it be cajoled,
flattered nor moved by sympathy nor peti-
604
~igion
tion; but when we understand our unity
with this Universal Principle, we shall
appear to be favored because we shall
have found the source of all wisdom and
power.
It must be conceded by every thinking
person that the answer to prayer fur-
nishes the evidence of an all-pervasive,
omnipotent intelligence which is immi-
nent in all things and all persons. We
have heretofore personalized this ever-
present intelligence and called it God,
but the idea of personality has become
associated with form and form is a prod-
uct of matter. The ever-present intelli-
gence or mind must be the Creator of
all form, the director of all energy, the
source of all wisdom.
In order to secure the best thought of
the world on the value of prayer, "The
Walker Trust," recently offered a pnze
605
'Ihe J\(f_,wPsychology
of $rno.oo for the best essay on "Prayer;
The meaning, the reality and the power
of prayer, its place and value to the in-
dividual, to the church and the state, in
the every day affairs of life, in the heal-
ing of disease, in times of distress and
national danger, and in relation to na-
tional ideals and to the world progress."
In response to the invitation 1667
essays were received. They came from
every quarter of the globe, they were
written in nineteen different languages.
The prize of $IOo.oo was awarded to the
Rev. Samuel McComb, D.D., of Balti-
more, Md. A comparative study of
these essays is published by the Macmil-
lan Company of New York. In giving
his impressions Mr. David Russell of
the Walker Trust says: "To practically
all the contributors prayer is something
606
'J?digion
real and of inestimable value, but un-
fortunately there is little information
given as to the method by which the law
is placed in operation." Mr. Russell,
himself, agrees that the answer to prayer
must be the operation of a Natural
Law, he says: "We know, that to make
use of a Natural Law, the intelligence
must be able to comprehend its condi-
tions and to direct or control its se-
quences. Can we doubt that to an in-
telligence great enough to encompass the
spirit, there would be revealed a realm
of spiritual law?" It seems that we are
rapidly coming into an understanding of
this law and understanding is control.
The value of prayer depends upon the
law of spiritual activity. Spirit is the
Creative Princi pie of the Uni verse and
is Omnipot~nt, Omniscient and Omni-
present. Thinking is a spiritual activ-
607
The ~w Psychology
ity, and consists of the reaction of the In-
dividual against the Universal Mind. "I
think, therefore I am," when "I cease to
think, I cease to exist." Thinking is the
only activity which spirit possesses.
Spirit is creative, thinking therefore is
a creative process, but as the larger part
of our thinking processes are subjective
rather than objective, most of our crea-
tive work is carried on subjectively. But
because this work is spiritual work it is
none the less real. We know that all the
great eternal forces of Nature are in-
visible rather than visible, spiJitual
rather than material, subjective rather
than objective.
But exactly because thinking is a crea-
tive process, most of us are creating de,
structive condit ions, we are thinking
death rather than life, we are thinking
lack rather than abundance, we are
608
7?,gigion
thinking disease rather than health, we
are thinking inharmony rather than har-
mony, and our experiences and the ex-
periences of our loved ones eventually
reflect the attitude of Mind which we
habitually entertain, for be it known that
if we can pray for those we love, we can
also injure them by entertaining and
harboring destructive thoughts concern-
ing them. We are free moral agents and
may freely choose what we think, but
the result of our thought is governed by
an immutable law; this is the modern
scientific phraseology for the Scriptural
statement: "Be not deceived for God
is not mocked, whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap."
Prayer is thought in the form of a
petition, and an affirmation is a state-
ment of Truth, and when reinforced
by Faith, another powerful form of
609
'Ihe ¾w 'Psychology
thought, they become invincible, because
"Faith is the substance of things hoped
for, the evidence of things not seen."
This substance is spiritual substance
which contains within itself the Creator
and the Created, the germ, the Elohim,
that which enters in, goes forth and be-
comes one with its object.
But prayers and affirmations are not
the only forms of creative thought. The
architect, when he plans to erect a won-
derful new building, seeks the quiet of
his studio, calls on his imagination for
new or novel features embodying addi-
tional comforts or utilities and is seldom
disappointed in the results.
The engineer who designs to span a
chasm or river, visualizes the entire
structure before making any attempt to
embody it in form, this visualization is
the mental image which precedes and
610
7?.digion
predetermines the character of the struc-
ture which will eventually take form in
the objective world.
The chemist seeks the quiet of his lab-
oratory and then becomes receptive to
the ideas from which the world will
eventually profit by some new comfort or
luxury.
The financier retires to his office or
counting room and concentrates on some
problem in organization or finance and
soon the world learns of another co-or-
dination of industry requiring millions
of additional capital.
Imagination, Visualization, Concen-
tration are all spiritual faculties, and are
all creative, because spirit is the one
Creative Principle of the Universe, and
he who has found the secret of the crea-
tive power of mind has found the secret
of the ages. The law stated in scientific
6u
'The ~w 'Psychology
terms is, that "thought will correlate
with its object," but unfortunately the
large majority are allowing their
thoughts to dwell upon lack, limitation,
poverty and every other form of de-
structive thought, and as the law is no re-
specter of persons these things become
objectified in their environment.
Finally, there is love, which is also
a form of thought. Love is nothing
material and yet no one will deny that it
is something very real. St. John tells
us that "God is Love"; again he says:
"Now are we all sons of God?" which
means that Love is the Creative Prin-
ciple of the Universe and St. Paul tells
us "In Him we live and move and have
our being."
Love is a product of the emotions, the
emotions are governed by the Solar
Plexus and the sympathetic nervous sys-
612
~eft'gion
tern. It is therefore a subconscious ac-
tivity and is entirely under the control
of the involuntary system of nerves. For
this reason it is frequently actuated by
motives which are dictated neither by
reason nor intellect. Every political dem-
agogue and religious revivalist takes ad-
vantage of this principle, they know
that if they can arouse the emotions, the
result is assured, so that the demagogue
always appeals to the passions and prej-
udices of his audience, never to the rea -
son. The revivalist always appeals to
the emotions through the love nature and
never to the intellect, they both know
that when the emotions are aroused in-
tellect and reason are stilled.
Here we find the same result obtained
through opposite polarities, one appeal-
ing to hatred, revenge, class prejudices
and jealousy; the other appealing to
6r3
'The X!._,wPsychology
love, service, hope and joy, but the prin-
ciple is the same. One attracts, the other
repels; one is constructive, the other de-
structive; one is positive, the other nega-
tive; the same power is being placed in
operation in the same way, but for dif-
ferent purposes. Love and hatred are
simply the opposite polarities of the
same force, just as electricity or any
other force may be used for destructive
purposes just as readily as it may be
used for constructive purposes.
Some will say that if God is Spirit and
is Omnipotent and Omnipresent, how
can He be responsible for destructive
conditions; He cannot bring about dis-
aster, want, disease and death. Cer-
tainly not, but we can bring these things
upon ourselves by a non-compliance with
the spiritual laws. If we do not know
that thought is creative, we may enter-
614
_'l\digion
tain thoughts of inharmony, lack and
disease, which will eventually result in
the condition of which these thoughts are
the seed forms, but by an understanding
of the law we can reverse the process and
thereby bring about a different result.
Good and evil are thereby seen to be
but relative terms indicating the result
of our thoughts and actions. If we en-
tertain constructive thoughts only, the
result will benefit ourselves or others,
this benefit we call good, if on the other
hand we entertain destructive thought,
this will result in inharmony for our-
selves and others, this inharmony we
call evil, but the power is the same in
either event. There is but one source
of power and we can use the power for
good or for evil, just as we can make use
of electricity for light, heat or power by
an understanding of the laws governing
615
'Ihe :A{£w Psychology
electricity, but if we are careless or ig-
norant of the laws governing electricity,
the result may be disastrous. The power
is not good in one case and evil in the
other; the good or evil depend upon our
compliance with the law.
Many will ask, "how does this thought
agree with the scripture?" Many mil-
lions of Bibles are sold annually, and
every discovery in chemistry, science or
philosophy must be in agreement with
the vital Truth of religious thought.
What then was the thought of the
Master concerning the Creator? It will
be remembered that the question was put
to him by a lawyer: "Master what
shall I do to inherit eternal life?" Did
He evade the question? Did He quote
some ancient authority? Did He recom-
mend some creed or theological dogma?
He did not. His answer was direct and
616
~igion
to the point: "Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God with all thy heart, with all thy
soul, with all thy mind and with all thy
strength, and thy neighbor as thyself."
Where is this God which the lawyer
is told to love? Jesus refers to Him as
the Father. "He that hath seen me hath
seen the Father," again, "The Father
and I are one," again, "It is not I that
doeth the work, but the Father that
dwelleth in me, He doeth the work,"
again, He taught His disciples to pray:
"Our Father which art in Heaven," and
when asked concerning the location of
Heaven, He said: "Men shall not say
Lo here or Lo there, for behold the
Kingdom of Heaven is within you."
Here then is authority as to the imma-
nence of the Creator, the Father, from
the Master Physician himself. Thus, we
find that Science and Religion are not
617
The :A(j_,w
Psychology
m conflict and that within the Church
and without there is a setting aside of
traditional creeds and a return to the
things which the Great Teacher taught
and the things for which He stood.
The Old Testament has much to say
concerning the God of Jacob and of
Moses, but this conception of an An-
thropomorphic God is principally in-
teresting as indicating the thought of a
people who believed that the world was
flat, that the sun moved, when science
was but magic and religion the dogma
of the scholastics.
This was the result of the deductive
method of reasoning which originated
with certain statements of fact which
were universal and absolute, and which
were incapable of verification, all other
facts must be arrived at by a process of
deduction from these original axioms.
618
'R.fjigion
If facts were observed which seemed to
contradict the deductions from which
these original axioms were formulated,
so much the worse for the facts, they
could not be f~cts. Facts are nothing
compared with "statements of Truth" as
given by the scholastics. If there were
those who persisted in seeing these un-
welcome facts, there was the hemlock,
or the stake or the cross.
But in the New Tes~ament all of this
is reversed, the doctrine of the imma-
nence of God is taught, an objective God
is converted into a subjective God, we
are told that, "In Him we live and move
and have our Being," we are told that
"The Kingdom of Heaven is within
you," and we are led to infer that God
is always in the "Kingdom ."
It will readily be seen that the Naz-
arene completely reversed the process of
619
'The J\(f_,wPsychology
thought in vogue at that time, instead of
using the deductive method of thinking
he used the inductive. He accepted no
authority, no dogma, no creed, instead of
reasoning from the seen to the unseen,
the visible to the invisible, from things
temporal to things eternal, He reversed
this process completely, and as the idea
of this immanent God took hold of man,
as they began to understand that, "Closer
is He than breathing, nearer than hands
or feet," then gradually came an awak-
ening, which marks the birth of a splen-
dor such as had never before been
known.
In this connection it is interesting to
note that the miscellaneous collection of
manuscripts which have finally been
put together and called the Bible were
written by many different men, of many
different locations, and at widely differ-
620
~igion
ent times. At first these manuscripts
were circulated separatdy, later they
were collected into a single volume and
for a long time there were serious dis-
putes among the ancient Jews and the
early Church Ecclesiastics as to what
manuscripts should have a place in the
sacred book. In fact, until quite re-
cently there were many of these manu-
scripts included which are not now to be
found in the Bible as recognized by the
Protestant Church of today.
The manuscripts comprising the Old
Testament were written originally in He-
brew, those of the New Testament in
Greek, and not a single original manu-
script of any book either of the Old or
the New Testament is in existence today,
nor have ~hey been in existence for hun-
dreds of years. We have then only
621
The ~w Psychology
copies of copies of copies many times
removed from the o iginal.
When we remember that those who
undertook to translate these manuscripts
into the English language for the pur-
pose of giving them to the people met
with violent opposition, frequently being
driven from the country and excommu-
nicated from the church, we see that
there was little uniformity in the various
translations of these manuscripts which
are now called the Bible or the "Word
of God."
The King James edition which finally
became popular with the people was the
work of fifty-four . churchmen who
agreed with each other that all differ-
ences of opinion should be settled at
special meetings to be held from time to
time and that all marginal notes con-
cerning the Greek . or Hebrew text
622
1?.!ji"gion
should be eliminated. The fact that
this edition had the sanction of the King
was probably the determining factor in
favor of its general adoption, but aside
from this the work came to be held in
high esteem by the scholastics because
of the smoothness and beauty of the dic-
tion, the churchmen who had the re-
vision in charge evidently sacrificing
accuracy for euphony and rhetoric.
And now we have a strictly "Ameri-
can" Bible, the work of the American
Revision Committee in which the fa-
mous definition of Faith by St. Paul,
"Now Faith is the substance of things
hoped for, the evidence of things not
seen" is changed to "Now Faith is the
assurance of things hoped for, a con-
viction of things not seen," from which
it would appear that Paul did not be-
gin to have the insight, the vision, the
623
'The ~w Psychology
intuition with which he has been cred-
ited, the latter translation completely
nullifying and destroying what has here -
tofore been the most wonderful defini-
tion of faith ever given to the world.
If the inductive method of reasoning
obtained in religion, we should find all
religions co-operating for the purpose of
bringing about ."Peace on Earth and
good will toward men." We should find
every school of theology co-operating
with every other school for the purpose
of spreading the "glad tidings of great
joy," telling of a Redeemer who has
come "That we might have life and
have it more abundantly," and that this
abundant life may be had by looking
within instead of without. That objec -
tive peace is the result of subjective
peace, that harmony without is the nat-
ural consequence which follows harmony
624
'R.fji'gi'on
within, that "men do not gather figs from
thistles, or grapes from thorns," and that
a man's character is the evidence of the
value of his religion: "For by their
fruits shall they be known," such a re-
ligion satisfies the brain as well as the
heart, religion is to love justice, to long
for the right, to love mercy, to forget
wrongs and remember benefits, to love
the truth, to be sincere, to love liberty,
to cultivate the mind, to be familiar with
the mighty thoughts that genius has ex-
pressed, the noble deeds of all the world,
to cultivate courage and cheerfulness.
To make others happy, to receive new
truths with gladness, to cultivate hope,
to see the calm beyond the storm, the
dawn beyond the night. This is the
religion of reason, the creed of science.

HE primitive races never develop
sufficiently to embody their ideas
in a literature; they are the so-
called savage and barbarous tribes of an-
cient and modern times, and may be
known to some extent through the sur-
vival of their ideas and customs, through
their civilized descendants and through
writings of these same descendants .
In the early period we are impressed
by the psychological Unity of man. De-
tails of these early races differ, of course,
yet the variations are far less than one
would suspect, for it is a surprising fact,
that in all parts of the world, the Minds
of Men, as they reach to the fundamental
facts of existence, work very nearly in the
same way.
The :J\(j_,w
'Psychology
The Psychological likeness of the
process of man's mind is one of the most
striking discoveries of modern times.
The essential part of the religions of
antiquity is not so much one of belief, as
of Practice-Man had not yet evolved
enough to reason-to weigh and compare
his thoughts. He needed discipline to
train his body and his emotions; he was
therefore given exercises suitable for this
purpose. His struggle for existence
caused him to look up to supernatural Be-
ings, whom he designated as Gods to se-
cure their aid; to avert their anger, he
must make sacrifices ; Gods were to be
feared.
Life after death is another universal
belief. Some souls went to the Under-
world, some to Heaven. Another belief
was called Animism or belief that every-
thing-not only animals, but the trees,
630
(omparat£ve 'J?.digion
the thunder, water, earth, fire, etc.-had
a soul or spirit.
Spirits might wreak their vengeance
on man, if they became displeased with
his actions, so these in turn were to be
fe.ared.
This fear system was allowed, for by it
man learned to obey orders. Many tribes
had ideas such as, that inanimate parts of
an animal, as bones, claws, tails, feet, etc.,
retained something of the Power of the
living thing and this was called Fe-
tishism.
Closely related to Fetishism was Idol
Worship. We therefore see that social
organizations down to this day are af-
fected by ancient conceptions entertained
of the Gods.
Man thought at that time, of the Earth
as a Goddess-the mother of inexhausti-
631
'The :7'{£wPsychology
ble fertility-of thunder, as warriors'
bolts.
These conceptions, we readily admit,
color all of our literature, and are the
origin of many supe rstitions.
Totemism is a name. given to the sys-
tem of tribal subdivisions, denoted by
Totem . Totems are usually natural ob-
jects, such as animals, but also trees and
plants , as the emblem of a clan or tribe.
Totem is an American Indian word,
denoting "Ancestor" or F~mily History
-yet the practice exists in many parts of
the world. Sacrifice has always been of~
fered in all parts of the world.
In these primitive religions, all so-
called civilized religions have had their
roots. Some substance of a tree comes
through its roots, more comes from the
air through its leaves, so civilized reli-
632
(omparati've 'R.!Ji'g;z'on
gions owe much to the inheritance of the
remote uncivilized past.
Their beliefs are often irrational and
their practices revolting, but through
them the way outward and upward is
opened.
Since humanity has never reached per-
fection, so no religion has ever been a per-
fect religion, and religion has always
suffered from the attempt to crystallize it
into form. But all religions are funda-
mentally the same, they are but the innate
desire of the ego of Humanity, through
its long Journey from the clod, to deepen
faith by adding to faith, Knowledge.
Man has ever been religious in his na-
ture-there has ever been within him an
eternal Urge, that has pushed him on, in
his threefold unfoldment-and that
something is within itself. It is the Life
633
'The ~w Psychology
Principle-and so we migh t call religion
the Technique of Unfolding Life.
We are now living in a period of time,
called by students of the higher thought,
the Aryan Period. This is the fifth pe-
riod of time in World History . Through
the other four periods, man was busy
with his unfoldment and the acquirement
of his faculties; and a religion suitable
to his meager understanding was a neces-
sary means to this end.
As "man is heir to the ages," we find
that in each primitive period, there were
teachings, that were handed down, to
later periods, and incorporated into their
beliefs, thus we have the Legends and
Folk Lore stories which still come to us,
from the long past ages.
As we read and compare these far
away traditions and legends, it is inter-
esting to note that through them have
634
Comparative'R.!Ji'gion
come the story of the serpent, the story of
the separation of the Sexes, as Adam and
Eve, the story of the Garden of Eden,
and the story of an Egg, which is to this
day an emblem of life-and many other
similar stories which are given in modern
religions as emblems of Truth.
There was also, always in each, a story
of a flood, and this is important, because
it coincides with science, which says that
the earth has been inundated many times.
Babylonia, Assyria and Egypt have all
left legacies of thought and philosophy,
that have had an influence on the human
heart and mind.
But who has not read of that wonder
land of Egypt ?-and having read, did
not feel an at-one-ment with old Egypt,
and did not have a mystical longing to be
there-that he might feel this at-one-
ment deeper.
635
'The J'lflw Psychology
This mighty land of a lost romanc~,
was in reality created out of a desert by
the thrice romantic river Nile.
Here is, perhaps, one of this earth's old -
est civilizations-History is lost in the
dim far away past, but far beyond 5000
years B.C., there were tribes, whose many
Gods were living there, and each tribe
had their "Totems."
Birds, and animals, played a large part
as regard their religious symbology.
As the neighboring nations had their
Gods "of fertility," so their more popular
Gods were Osiris and his sister wife Isis.
Osiris was represented by the N ile, and
Isis by the land of Egypt, and at certain
seasons the Nile overflowed and irrigated
the otherwise desert land, which by the
overflow yielded a plentiful harvest, and
the Harvest represented Horns, the Child
God.
Comparative7<.digion
Egypt's Gods were many, yet as time
wore on, her ideas and ideals changed
somewhat, and her Gods were grouped,
as in families, and finally numbered
Nine, which later was called by the
Greeks an "Eunead." This grouping was
because of our numerical system of nine
digits.
The effect of this religion was felt in a
development of a sensitive social con-
sciousness. It became an age of reflection
and philosophical study.
Egypt was however becoming skeptic.
In its early days it was only the kings
who ascended to heaven. "Now," they
asked, "why not the common man as
well?" Here we see the seeds of democ-
racy sprouting.
It is said that there arose a king, who
was intensely religious, and who tried to
bring man's mind to the One God idea.
637
'The ~w Psychology
This idea was embraced in the God "Ra,"
-a Sun God, but Egypt was not yet pre-
pared for such an innovatio n and clung
to her old Gods.
Under Rameses II, and Seti I, Egypt
came under Asiatic influence but the
deities, Baal, and Anah-Ashtar, left no
deep impression upon Egypti an ideals.

T
HE famous land of Palestine-a
long narrow strip of country, pos-
sessing many fertile valleys and
high mountains, lies east of the Mediter-
ranean Sea, and west of the Arabian Des-
ert, 70 miles wide by 12 5 in length-
about as large in area as the State of
Missouri.
Within it is the Dead Sea, 1300 feet
below sea level, and in it, is also Mount
Hermon, rising 9166 feet above sea level
and covered with snow from November
to August.
This remarkable land, and its varied
climates played an heroic part in the
birth of the Religion that has had much
influence upon the world.
The early books of the Bible were
641
The ~w Psychology
written much later than is generally sup-
posed, and the collection of the Hebrew
Patriarch stories, in the book of Genesis,
consists largely of traditions of a later
tribal history.
It is indicated by tradition that the
early Hebrew nations were composed of
four tribes, which were said to be de-
scended from four mothers, and of which
two are considered of importance, the
"Leah" and "Rachel" tribes-Leah
means "Wild Cow" and Rachel means an
Ewe.
Opinions differ as to whether these
were Totems or economic symbols.-The
Leah tribe might have been cattle rais-
ers, while the Rachel tribe sheep raisers
-The time is recorded at about 1300
B.C.-and it was probably the Rachel
tribes only, which were in Egypt and
were later led out by Moses.
642
Judaism
Reasoning by analogy it is probable
that the religion of these tribes before
they entered Palestine, did not differ
materially from that of the other tribes
about them-for the primitive Semitic
Pillars, Circumcision, the harem, etc.,
were perpetuated by them into much
later times. It is then reasonable to
think their religion similar to that of
those around them. Each tribe may
have had its deity; we read of the God
"Gad" which was probably the God of
the tribe of Asher, the Goddess Ashera.
The Kenite God was "Yahweh," or
Jehova and ancient Hebrew writers say
this worship went back to earliest times.
This early God was like many others
of that age, thought to be a God of
Fertility, and was said to mean, "He
who causes passionate love." They at-
tributed all activity to him, like the
643
The J\{j_,wPsych ology
eruption of a volcano, victories over their
enemies, etc.
There are indications that "Yahweh"
may have been a Divine name in North
Arabia for thousands of years before
Moses, and that the roaming emigrants
from this region to Babylonia and Pales-
tine, had carried this name and worship
to those countries.
Perhaps the greatest figure, in all this
history was Moses, born and reared in
Egypt while the Hebrew Nation was
held in bondage. There he was the
adopted son of a Princess who brought
him up in all the learning of Egypt.
But seeing the oppression of his people,
it is recorded that he slew an Egyptian
one day, and then in fear of vengeance,
fled from Egypt to the country of the
Medianites-Kenites and lived there
many years.
Judaism
While there he married Jethro's
daughter; Jethro was a Priest of Yah-
weh. At the "Burning Bush" on Yah-
weh's volcanic mountain, he was so im-
pressed with the power and majesty of
Yahweh, as to become his follower-
and he returned to Egypt to preach to
his enslaved people a way of escape
through this same power of Yahweh.
The escape was made and at the
Burning Mountain a "Covenant" was
made to make Yahweh their God and
to serve Him,-but later Moses and his
brother Aaron were made Priests, and
the covenant was placed in a box or
Ark that could be easily carried from
place to place, and which contained the
sacred emblems, which were emblematic
of Yahweh's presence with them.
His new worshipers' duties were
summed up into a code of ten laws-
645
'The ~w Psychology
today known as the "Ten Command-
ments," thought by most people to be
ten because this infant race could count
them on their fingers. This was a moral
code of laws with a strict mathematical
basis and what is most remarkable, this
code has stood the test of the ages and
still holds good, and is embodied in the
Laws of most countries of the earth
today.
It is true that the contemporary reli-
gions, and later ones had in them prac-
tically most of the laws given to Moses,
but somehow, these have stood out clear
and have been used by all nations as a
basis for law.
Yahweh's emphatic demand of the
"One God" idea, or monotheism, was
the first great ethical teaching-next
was for righteousness, between man and
man-His first Prophets held to the
646
Judaism
ideas of sacrifice and justice-later ones
told of Yahweh 's love. "Yahweh had
chosen Israel for a bride" and her faith-
lessness to him was base ingratitude, and
deeply grieved his heart.
Later prophets spoke of a new teacher
to come-of a Messiah-also of a change
of heart and an inwardness of religion
-and the teachings of the Prophets
Isaiah and Jeremiah did much to set
religion free from time worn shackles.
The development of Israel's · religion,
from its primitive Semitic beginning to
the formation of Judaism, is one of the
most significant chapters in human his-
tory-for in other countries as in Egypt,
the Monotheistic idea was grasped by
but a few-In Israel alone, was it made
the possession of the people. It is on
account of this that the Hebrew Reli-
gion became mother to three great mon-
647
'The ~w Psychology
atheistic religions of the world-Juda-
ism, Mohammedanism and Christianity
-Jerusalem was "Yahweh's Holy City,"
and is to this day. But to follow the
Hebrews, who are later called Jews,
through their long history of rises and
falls, of their captivity and return, of
their national evolution, and then their
final "scattering among the nations," is
not our purpose.
Man has always been a roving animal,
and coming in contact with other na-
tions led to national troubles-we read
of friction between the Jews and the
Samaritans, and later with Persia and
Babylonia, and Greece and Rome, and
they then felt the influence of the various
currents of life and thought that swayed
the world.
The Sages and Seers, Philosophers
and Poets of these foreign nations had
648
Judaism
their weight, and we see the result in the
Proverbs of Solomon and the Psalms
of David, and note the Greek thought in
the book of Ecclesiasties.
MOHAMMEDANISM
T
HE city of Mecca was the seat
of a powerful tribe of Korei:sch
people, and was a place to which
all the people of Arabia came each year
to celebrate a festival, or to trade.
It was under these conditions that
Mohammed was born at Mecca, 570
A.D.
Before his birth a sect had Broken
away from the old religion, and claimed
to be seeking for the faith of Abraham.
Mohammed seems to have been much
given to Mystical and religious things.
He lived in Mecca till he was 50 years
old, having in the meantime married
and had six children, two sons and four
daughters. At one time he was agitated
by grave doubts, and withdrawing from
651
'The ~w Psychology
his family, and Mecca, spent two years
in a cave in prayer and meditation, and
at the end came back with a strong con-
viction that God had commissioned him
to be a prophet to his people, and he at
once began and continued preaching for
ten years during which period he at-
tracted but few followers, these however
were loyal ones-and in time the number
grew.
His cardinal doctrine was the "One-
ness," and Aloneness of God.
This God he called "Allah" meaning
"The God."
He saw God as a Great Human Being
or a transcendent man-He had hands,
feet, eyes and all other human attributes.
He was all-wise, and powerful and an
absolute despot of the world.
It was useless for man to try to under-
652
Jteohammedanism
stand him; but He would be merciful if
man submitted to His will.
The next doctrine to be taught was
that Mohammed was His prophet-"N o
prophet was to come after Mohammed"
-Religion was to give man peace, the
Arabic root of which is "Salama," said
to be "The Infinitive" of the causative
stem of which is "Islam" "to submit"
' '
and as he preached the doctrine of Sub-
mission, he called his religion "Islam."
As time went on he added to these
doctrines many material teachings, as
reward and punishment; believers were
to be rewarded with a material para-
dise, in the way of a Harem Home-and
unbelievers were to be tortured in a very
material Hell-two passages from the
Koran illustrate this-"Is the reward of
Goodness, aught but goodness? Then
653
The ~w Psychology
which of your Lord's bounties will ye
deny? and besides these are gardens
twain-with green foliages-in each are
two gushing springs-in each fruits and
palms, and Pomegranates-In them are
maidens best and fairest-bright and
large-eyed maidens, kept in their tents,
reclining in cushions and beautiful car-
pets-Blessed be the name of the Lord,
possessed of honor and maj.esty" (Koran-
Sura LV060-75).
So much for rewards-But also note
these punishments-"To those who mis-
believe, for them are cut out garments
of fire-Then shall be poured over their
heads boiling water-wherewith what is
in their bellies shall be dissolved and
their skins too, and for them are maces
of iron, whenever they desire to come
forth therefrom through pain, they are
654
utfohammedanism
sent back into it, and taste ye the tor-
ment of the Burning" (Koran-Sura-
XXII, 20). The doctrines of angels
and Satan were borrowed from Juda-
1sm.
On account of some dislike by the
people of Mecca for Mohammed, he
fled from there to Medina. This is a
great point in Mohammedanism, for
from this, their time is marked-at
Medina, Mohammed was accepted as
their ruler and in it Islam was changed
somewhat.
For some time as had been his custom,
he continued to pray with his face
towards Jerusalem, for he fondly hoped
that the Jews, of which there were many
in Medina, would accept him as a suc-
cessor of their prophets. In this he was
sadly disappointed.
655
The ~w Psychology
He then changed the direction of
prayer from Jerusalem to Mecca-and
the ideals of Arabia soon became more
influential than those of Jerusalem and
Israel.
ZOROASTRIANISM
I
F WE read of some of the older
religions, with the idea of seeing
. what the people of that religion be-
lieved, we may get a wrong idea or con-
cept, of that belief, because the time and
the locality are an important indication
of its teachings.
Zoroastrianism was born in Persia, a
great table-land country about one fifth
the area of the United States. It is
almost surrounded by high mountains,
which open only through rocky passes.
It has but few rivers and these lose them-
selves in the sandy soil.
As Zoroaster was said to be the great
agricultural God, we can more readily
see why agriculture became a part of
religious duty.
'The :J{£w 'Psychology
The struggle with nature in this ele-
vated table-land produced an efficient
and practical people, not unlike the
Romans in general characteristics. But
note the differ .ence of their kinsmen, in
India, where there was a milder cli-
mate. Here you see the speculative,
contemplative and highly mystical char-
acter; but the Persia n remained to the
end an active and alert body, more inter-
ested in things objective than meta-
physical. So to them was sent a Teacher
and Master who could reach their
minds, hearts and abilities-and Zo-
roaster's teachings are quite different
from all others.
The book of the "Avestas," or
"Knowledge" was written long after
Zoroaster's days, but it carries his teach-
ings and ideals in the form of poems
658
Zoroastrianism
(not unlike our psalms), they composed
their religion.
The old Iranian religion, still held
sway and while Zoroaster opposed these,
still Ahura, under Zoroaster became
"Ahura-Mad-Masdah," a fire God-So
he taught Astronomy to his people with
the fire of the Sun as the life of all liv-
ing things.
Zoroaster was at first called Zara-
thustra-and the names are no doubt
indicative of office, rather than person,
like our word "president" or "judge"-
but it is certain there was one great Zo-
roaster-One with new ideals and a
system.
At about twenty years of age he re-
tired from his fellows and sought his
own Faith and no doubt began to formu-
late the general truths of his system;
and again like Jesus, we see him at 30
659
The ~w Psychology
years of age getting visions and revela-
tions.
In a vision that was thrice repeated in
one day, he was admitted to the presence
of Ahura-Masdah-the Supreme Being
Himself, and was taught by Him, in
Heaven.
Upon Zoroaster's return to earth, he at
once began to preach to the then ruling
Priests, his own reli gion, the worship
of Masdah 1 the glor ification of Arch-
angels, denouncing Demons 1 etc.
Later he was given six more visions,
in which each of the Archangels ap-
peared to him and each of these became
to him personified qualities 1 such as
"Good Thought"- "Good Words"-
"Good Deeds," etc.
Zoroaster was a practical Monotheist.
In his thought "Ahura-Masdah" was the
one God Supreme.
66o
Zoroastrianism
He was diplomatic in that he incor-
porated or so used the ideals, with new
interpretations, as to lessen the offence
and shock to his new converts.
He taught that man had two natures
-an animal and a Divine nature, and
through practice of good thoughts, "Per-
fect Righteousness," etc., man would be
one at last with Masdah, and to those
who were trying, Masdah gave help, if
asked to do so.
He assumed that man is the arbiter
of his own destiny; he can do right if he
will.
Right is truthfulness, the practice of
justice, and the fostering of agriculture.
Wrong is lying, robbery and the de-
struction of irrigation, cattle or crops.
Rewards and punishments were alike
the results of these acts.
661
THE VEDIC RELIGION
I
NDIA, extending from the Hima-
laya Mountains, on the North, to
the Indian Ocean on the South,
presents a variety of temperatures and
climate. It is a great three-cornered
country, 1000 miles North and South
and almost the same distance East and
West.
The scene of the Vedic Religion, how-
ever is only concerned with the two
great river valleys of the Indus and the
Ganges. In the upper part of the val-
ley of the Indus, where the rivers are fed
by the melting of the snows, on the
Himalayas, the climate is that of a tem-
perate zone, much like that of our
Central States. The valley of the
Ganges lies further to the South, and is
663
'The ~w Psyc/20/ogy
dependent for its fertility upon the rains
brought over by the monsoons. The
climate is not favorable to human life
and the struggle for existence is severe.
There came into the upper Indus val-
ley, through the passes of the Kush
Mountains, some tribes of Aryan stock.
They spread over the northern part of
the Indus valley and lived here for some
centuries, and here were composed the
Vedas-a sort of Bible or Epic of Di-
vine Wisdom. Later some of this race
passed into the Ganges valley, and some
writers hold that the splitting of the
religions that followed was due to the
depressing effect of the climate of that
valley.
More than 100 books are called Vedas
-the principal of which are the Rig-
Veda-the Yagur-Veda and the Sama-
Veda. Veda means "wit" or "Knowl-
664
The Vedic 'R,digion
edge"-the oldest of the Vedas 1s the
Rig-Veda, and consists of Hymns of
praise, containing about 10,000 stanzas,
though not all are stanzas of praise-
some are called family books, some are
Books of Blessing and Curses, etc.
They are supposed to have been com-
posed by different poets and seers-The
other Vedas were dedications and some
were set to music.
The Brahamanas are theological treat-
ises, written in prose and deal with sac-
rificial ceremonies, they often reveal a
reflective spirit which was unsatisfied
with the mere offering of animal sacri-
fices, and sought for union with a spir-
itual Being.
Closely connected with the Brahma-
nas' reflective side, are the Upanishads,
which are a new and quite different re-
665
'Ihe :J{£w Psyc/20/ogy
ligion. The Upanishads as literature,
are of next importance to the Rig-Vedas.
It is generally agreed that the Upani-
shads were written before the time of
Gautama, called the Buddha, who died
487 B.C. and this seems certain because
the whole Buddhistic system of thought
presupposes the philosophic conceptions
of the Upanishads. It is therefore rea-
sonable that Brahmanas and Upanishads
developed in the period 800 to 500 B.C.
The Rig-Veda was more like a so-
cial order-a simple patriarchal so-
ciety, ruled by chieftains called Rajas.
In Rig-Veda, the family was the foun-
dation of society-the father, the Lord
of the house, was also a priest, who
offered sacrifice; the wife though sub-
jected to him, occupied a position of
greater honor than in the age of the
Brahmanas, for she took part in the
666
'Ihe Vedi"c<Jvjz"gi"on
offering of sacrifice-she was the mis-
tress of the house and shared control
of the children, the slaves and the un-
married brothers and sisters of the
husband.
The standards of morality were high.
The community was agricultural, and
the standard of value was a cow, though
the metals Gold and Bronze are referred
to-later, conquests were made by abo-
rigines of other countries, especially in
the Ganges valley and in the course of
struggles thus entailed there came about
a difference of occupation and eventu -
ally there was a Priestly class, a warrior
class and an agricultural class, and here
is the beginning of the caste systems of
those countries.
Of the Vedic Deities, it was claimed
there were thirty-three, a very signifi-
cant number in human evolution, but the
667
'Ihe ~w Psychology
most important was Indra, who was a
tribal God, supposed to be the fighter of
the national battles-and this fighting
character he has never thrown off.
He is of the earth, earthy. He slays
dragons and monsters . He was a glut-
ton, a drunkard and a poaster.
Another God was Agui, God of fire.
-It is well here to stop and consider
the remarkable fact, that in nearly all
of these early religions, this considera-
tion of the Sacredness of the four ele-
ments, Earth, Air, Water and Fire-
This is a universal teaching of those
early religions, and is the same in all
parts of the world.
These ancient people of India mani-
fested a strong lust, towards the multi-
plication of Gods through the personifi-
cation of the Powers of nature and of
668
'Ihe Vedt'c.'R,di'gt'on
the Morning and the Evening Stars, or
Sun and Moon, and Mother Earth, etc.
In the Rig-Veda, the Creation is re-
ferred to as an act of natural Generation
(Rig-Veda. IV-2).
The king of Death was called Yama,
and ruled over the places of the dead,
both good and bad.
Their idea of immortality was very
vague, though a strong desire for it is
indicated in later literature, the U pani-
shad and the Mahabharata; there are
clear traces of an Indian belief in a Hell
and in a Heaven.
The Brahamanas was a book of rituals,
relating both to sacrifice and to worship,
and also to the duties of the four differ-
ent castes called "The Brahman" or
Priestly class, the Rajauya, or warrior
class-the Viazga or agricultural class,
and the Indra or servant class.
669
BUDDHISM
L
KE Jesus of Nazareth, Gautama,
founder of the Buddhist teach-
ings, has left no books of his own
writing to the world, though there are
some which include his doctrine that
have been ascribed to him.
He was born near Benares, about 567
B.C. His father was a prince named
Suddhodana.
At the time of his birth, the mother
was on her way to her father's home, but
her son was born under some tall. trees
in a pleasant grove, called "Lumbini."
The mother died a week later, and her
sister reared the boy.
It is related that Gautama had little
or no interest in his princely duties and
in reality abandoned his home, wife and
671
'The :J\&_,w
Psychology
child to devote his time to study and
religion-but this was not unusual, for
with the rise of the Upanishads, there
had grown up a body of Ascetics who
abandoned the world, lived in poverty
and in forests and mountains and begged
their food.
Gautama was led to this step by Four
visions: that of beholding a man de-
crepit through age; a sick man; a de-
caying corpse and a dignified hermit.
Before leaving home, he stole into the
chamber of his sleeping wife and child
to look at them for a last time.
This parting the Buddhists call the
"Great Renunciation."
He then went South-East and South
of the Ganges where he spent some time
studying the Brahman Philosophy under
two distinguished teachers-But this did
not satisfy him and he withdrew into a
672
'Buddhism
jungle and for six years gave himself to
the severest asceticism, and thereby
gained fame in India.
But still he had no peace of soul until
one day through intensified fasting, he
fell in a swoon and was regarded by his
disciples as dead, but he recovered, and
despairing of further profit from such
rigorous penance he began to take regu-
lar food, and gave up his self-mortifi-
cation.
There now followed a second crisis
in Gautama's career. All the teachings
of Hindu philosophy had failed him,
and he almost despaired of reaching his
goal.
While wandering and meditating he
sat down under a Banyan tree-Here he
reviewed the years of his life, and fought
with temptation, in much the same way
as that recorded of Jesus; as the day
673
'The ~w Psychotogy
ended he saw in a vision a new path and
saw that he himself was Buddha or the
"Enlightened One."
This tree was called the "Bo" tree-
the tree of enlightenment. His secret
was his Peace in the power over the
human heart; of inward culture and
Love for others.
Because of his experience, the Bo-tree
has become to the Buddhist, almost what
the Cross is to the Christian.
Man has had his symbols for unseen
or metaphysical qualities, throughout
all the ages.
He taught the idea of a Supreme God,
and that the Devas or Gods of the old
religion were real beings, but that they
were like men, entangled with the mate-
rial meshes.
He taught Karma and Reincarnation 1
or the doctrine of cause and effect.
674
YOGA SYSTEM
W
E CANNOT leave India
and her mighty schools of
thought without glancing at
the modern development and we must
turn to history to see how the ancient be-
liefs became changed.
Neither the Vedic religion nor the
Upanishads, was supplanted by the
Buddhist religion nor by the Jainistic
heresies, for each lived on and in turn
has undergone many changes in the
course of the centuries.
India has had many upheavals, and
has been subjugated by different peo-
ple at different periods, as by the
Syrians, the Partheni.ans, and the Mo-
hammedans, but the most important con-
quest was that by Great Britain in
1803 A.D.
675
The :J\(f_,w
·Psychology
The various systems of philosophy,
that were evolved out of the thought
of the Upanishads, maintained that there
are two Eternal Beings; this was the
theory of the Great Th inker Kapila who
revolted from the monotheistic theory
of the Upanishads and who recognized
only matter and the individual soul-he
recognized no God.
The Yoga system was still later estab-
lished by one Patangali-"Y oga" means
Yoke or "Union," in this case union with
God or the higher self, and lays em-
phasis on experience and knowledge,
rather than on asceticism, fasting and
other penances that had long been prac-
ticed in India. These were taken up
and enforced by the Yoga, with phil-
osophical explanations, and with the
object of isolating the soul from matter,
that it might be united with God.
676
Yoga System
To stand with mud caked in the hair
of one's head, till the birds nested in it,
immovable because the soul was in static
abstraction, was one of the extreme mani-
festations of the practice of the Yoga
Philosophy.
Still another development of the
Upanishads was that of the "Vedanta,"
originated by a commentator on the
Veda who lived about 800 A.D.
It claims the phenomenal world has
no reality of existence, any more than
that of a dream, and that the bad dream
of birth and rebirth will go on until
each soul recognizes that there is no real
existence except Brahman-Alman.
Then the knowledge of itself becomes
salvation.
Here Brahman sometimes meant God
Supreme, and at others a Supreme Per-
677
The ~w Psychology
sonal God-and here is the origin of
some of our very recent ideals such as
the unreality of matter and the belief
that the Supreme God, can become per-
sonal, as held by some of our Orthodox
Churches.
The Madhabharata, the great Indian
Epic, is a great work of many authors,
whose mass of material was a gradual
growth, and based on stories dating far
back into Indian Antiquity, it is a story
of many wars, intrigues, hatred, loves,
etc., and centers around a hero Krishna,
who was later deified and became a God
to the people, who worshipped him as
"Bhagavata" or the "Adorable."
The Bagavad-Gita or song of the
Blessed, lends probability to the theory
just mentioned. This story, so popular
in this day, among advanced students all
over the world is an episode from the
678
Yoga System
sixth book of the Mahabharata. It
points out the two natures in man, the
lower and the higher self, and that these
are ever at war with each other. The
teaching is given in dialogue form, and
Arjuna asks Krishna many questions, to
which he replies with much spiritual in-
formation and illustration.
In Him Pantheism is made personal
-the great struggle of life is the strug-
gle between one's Higher and Lower
self. There are other Epic Poems,
which have much significance in India,
as the Ramayama. The teaching in gen-
eral stands for lofty ideals, while some
have more or less degenerated into im-
morality.
Hinduism is today a religion of nearly
200,000,000 people and presents many
varieties of faiths and practices. These
diversities have been created by an end-
679
'The ~w Psychology
less lot of influences, internal and ex-
ternal that have come to India at large
since the Vedic age. It has left to it
some ideas that are beautiful and many
noble. But the one great ideal, is a men-
tal conception of religion, rather than a
spiritual one.
68o
CONFUCIANISM
"}\_WAYS and in every thing let
there be reverence; with the
deportment grave, as when
one is thinking, and with the speech
composed and definite."-Li-Ki-I-1.
The above is a quotation from one
of the old, old Chinese writers, and
when one stops to consider the Chinese
character of this late day, we know that
this teaching has sunken deeply into
the Chinese character. There is no race
with as much natural dignity, poise and
reverence.
The beginning of Chinese civilization
appears to have been in N. W. China in
those provinces watered by the Yellow
River in a dry and bracing climate, with
681
'Ihe ~w Psychology
a productive soil, that grows apples,
pears, grapes, nuts and millet.
Modern metaphysics, is beginning to
see that there is a hidden side to every
object in the U niverse, - and the high
initiates of that day probably did not
look upon this hidden side as containing
a deity, to be worshipped, but they did
see and teach an unseen quality or spirit-
ual force much the same as we of a later
day do.
They account for the origin of the
Universe by generation from two souls
or "Breaths," called "Yang" and "Ying"
-Yang was warmth, light and life-
also the Heavens from which all good
things come-Ying was darkness, cold,
death,-also the earth-Yang was sub-
divided into a number of good spirits,
called Shen.
Ying was divided into evil spirits
682
Confudanism
called, kwel, or specters and these two
kinds of Spirits animated the human
race.
Birth consisted in the infusion of these
souls-Death separated them-and the
"Shen" qualities returned to Yang and
Kwel to the Ying or earth.
As man had one Supreme ruler, so
also the Spirit world had a Supreme
Ruler-Shang-Ti-was the Ruler, but
they sacrificed to many lesser rulers
nevertheless.
The early religions are based on five
canonical books, Confucius rescued
from the early past of his days and
transmitted to Posterity, a book of His-
tory, a book of Odes-a book of filial
Piety, a book of Changes (Astrology)
and a book of rituals.
These teachings have largely made
Chinese character, what it is, to this day
683
The ~w Psychology
-The Emperor is thought to be the
"Son of Heaven"-and reverence for
ancestors has been a chief feature of in-
struction-Temples are scattered all
over the land, and two great festivals
were held at the Winter and Summer
Solstices showing that they knew what
the esoteric significance of these were.
The most influential person in Chinese
history is Confucius, who lived some-
where between 550 to 480 B.C.-As rec-
ords show, his life was similar to that
of any ordinary life, in any age.
At the age of fifteen, he bent his mind
to learning-later he married and had a
child, but domestic life was not con-
genial and he divorced his wife and be-
came a teacher, and here he found time
for study and meditation, two things
dear to the Mystic soul.
At thirty he stood firm-He had
684
(onf ucianism
formed his own opinion-and he became
famous and drew to himself many youths
of noble families, as pupils-and it is
said that at one time he had 3000 pupils.
He was a strict formalist in all things-
N ever a reformer, but to the end, his
religion was that of his ancestors.
The remote past was to him a golden
age, and to perpetuate it was his aim.
His noblest saying was this: "That
which I do not want others to put upon
me, I also wish not to put upon them."
A golden rule, truly the ruling principle
of this religion, is that the highest aim in
heaven and earth is "Virtue, for Virtue's
sake"-"Order is Heaven's only law."
Lao-Izz, was a second great Teacher
and Mystic in China. He was born
about 600 B.C. He occupied some high
position at the imperial court for many
years, but when signs of old age began
685
'The ~w 'Psychology
to show on him, he resigned and went
into seclusion and there he wrote that
remarkable book of wisdom, the "Tao-
Teh-King."
This gives the oldest teachings of Lao-
Izz-In his system the Great and ador-
able thing is the Tao-which may be
translated as the "Way," or "Power" or
"Nature" or even God.
To Lao-Izz, the Tao seemed the in-
expressible infinite, as he expresses in
these words. "He who knows the Tao,
does not care to speak of it: he who is
ever ready to speak about it, does not
know it. How pure and still the Tao
is, as if it would ever so continue; I do
not know whose son the Tao is. It
might appear to have been before
Shang-ti"-See in this "the feeling after
God" that St. Paul speaks of-Again
he says-"The highest excellence is like
686
(on/ uctanism
that of water. The excellence of water
appears in its benefitting all things, and
in its occupying without striving the low
places, which all men dislike-Hence its
way is near to that of the Tao."
All through his works we see a self
effacement and a sort of fatalism,
Buddhism, in its northern form; the
Mahayana was brought over into China,
in about 75 A.D. but knowledge of it
had reached there long before and for
some centuries, no Chinese were allowed
to become monks, but as time went on,
Chinese students made journeys to India
to farther learn of her beliefs.
But Confucianism was ever opposed
to that of Buddhism and much internal
dissatisfaction was the result, for in
Buddhism many found the spiritual
something which they needed, and to-
day Chinese Buddhism is nearly akin
687
'The :J,./lwPsychology
to that of Thibet. Their beliefs m
Prayer, in heaven and hell as a place of
abodes, between incarnations, etc., and so
in China we see Confucianism, Taoism
and Buddhism, not exclusive religions
but each affecting the whole.
We find that in summing up that
Confucianism ministers to the moral
man-Taoism to the problems of the
spirit forces, which play upon the pres-
ent life of man, and Buddhism makes
vivid the future life. Confucianism
deals with the visible present, Taoism
with the invisible present and Buddhism
with the invisible future.
688
SHINTOISM
J
APAN is a group of Islands off the
eastern coast of Asia, which stretch
in a curve, from about 31° to 45° N.
Latitude. Its early inhabitants were
probably of two races, the Aium and the
Yamato.
Traditions are about the same as of
other neighboring races. The Yamato
conquered most of the territory, but the
evolution was slow-the people lived in
huts-there were neither cities nor tem-
ples-they lived chiefly by hunting and
fishing-some crude efforts to raise rice
were made-Iron implements were used
-Marriage and the family was only
partially organized, but at a later date
evolution was hastened by influence
from China,-writing was introduced-
689
'The :J..&.,w
Psychology
also the Buddhist religious teachings be-
gan to have influence-a little later came
Confucianism, which has always been
more of a material philosophy, than that
of a spiritual religion, and through this
came Japan's state Religion.
The "Shint"-J apan's Emperors were
always held in thought as descending
from two primitive Deities, who gave
birth to all other gods of Japan. The
primitive religion was the conception
that man, animals and Gods formed one
society, their word for God, "Kami"
meaning super being - Kami was some-
times applied to the Sun, heavens or even
winds, also to a serpent-sometimes to
jewels, stones and in fact to any and all
things that excite wonder-to them as
to the semitic, the mystery of the propa-
gation of life, was most marvelous-
hence the numerous symbols of phalic
690
Shintoism
worship, but be it said of the Japanese,
that they saw the higher lesson in Phalic
symbology-and not the lower, for in
reverencing the symbolic forms, they
reverenced the Divine in its most won-
derful and beneficent form and it would
be well for modern Psychologists to for-
ever put from their minds, the old idea
that any of these object lessons given to
men for their upliftment, should ever be
thought of as a degenerate practice.
Creation was told as a tale of genera-
tion by a God and a goddess-our same
Positive and Negative forces-there was
no idea of a soul or of sin though there
was an idea of Heaven and the under-
world, but happy to say, neither of these
carried ideas of rewards and punish-
ments. Confucian Philosophy brought
the great reverence for Ancestry and es-
pecially that of the Rulers. This is
691
The ~w Psychology
called "Shintoism" in Japan as in China
and through it the "Family" and mar-
riage became more regulated and these
took next rank to that of the "Kami"-
thus in Shint's doctrines, man is in this
life, akin to the Divine and after death
joins the company of those who are
reverenced-How nearly akin is this
idea to our modern Brotherhood of
Man, as "Sons of God"!
It is said of the Japanese, that they
pray not for forgiveness of sins, but for
the sweet things of life; and for happi-
ness, but not for blessedness, and again
it is said, that the worshiper "May be
conscious, that his heart is not of Divine
quaEty, of purity, but he can of his own
accord, blow it off like dust, or wash it
off like a stain and regain its purity"-
all of which if analyzed, we find it to be
excellent modern Psychology.
692
Shintoi'.rm
So today we see Japan as a leading
oriental nation-Christianity has made
some converts, but Buddhism prevails-
while her progressive spirit was prob-
ably most fostered by China, through
Confucius' teachings, and there we see
more clearly, "How man is heir to the
nations' gains."

THE PHILOSOPHY OF
GREECE
T
HE religion of Greece was a re-
ligion of music, literature, statu-
ary and painting. The religious
side had in it, more of Philosophy than
Religion, nevertheless there was a medi-
tative note, running through it all, show-
ing that here the human mind began a
real analytical review of the vast work-
ings of the Universe about it.
The early inhabitants, reaching back
to 3000 B.C. and beginning in the Stone
Age, evolved in a similar manner to
those of Babylonia, Egypt, and China.
Inda-Europeans entered from the North
and passed through the valley of the
Danube, and in turn came under the in-
fluence of the Bronze Age. All these
695
'Ihe :l\(£w Psychology
mingled and were transformed and
absorbed.
The Pantheon was but a fusion of all
the deities.
Some of the grea ter Gods were Apollo
and Hermes.
In Miletus, an Ionian City in Asia
in the sixth century B.C., Thales, Anaxi-
mander and Ana ximanes, perceived a
unity of the world about, but sought for
one element that was the origin of all,
the transformation of which would ac-
count for all.
Thales called it Water, Anaximander
called it Air, but Pythagoras, who prob-
ably had studied in Arabia and Baby-
lonia, held that numerical relations ex-
plained all things, and we find that even
today, this science of numbers is still
being taught by teachers of the higher
thought.
696
'The 'Philosophy of <;;reece
Other great minds advanced other
great ideas. One philosopher held that
God is one, not many, and that he was
not like man. All things are one, and
nothing comes into being or is ever de-
stroyed. This philosopher was Xenoph-
anes.
Socrates, 469-397 B.C., was the critic
philosopher of his age. He showed the
shallowness of much pretended knowl-
edge, and at the same time, tried to draw
men to self-realization. He was pre-
eminently a teacher, and his method of
teaching, by means of questions and
answers, has never been surpassed. He
believed that there was within himself,
a spirit that would guide him and his
idea was to find the best way to live
here and now. He lived the simple life,
and when condemned to death, died
bravely and cheerfully.
697
'Ihe ~w 'Psychology
Plato, Socrates' pupil for eight years,
was one of the world's greatest philoso-
phers, teachers and authors. He taught
that all things outward are subject to
ceaseless change, and ideas only are
permanent and eternal. That sensuous
existences have originated from attempts
to express an eternal idea. The soul, in
his view, stands midway between ideas
and the corpore al world, and unites
both. The soul belongs to the world
above the senses, and in it only can we
find true and lasting existence.
Aristotle, a pupil of Plato, found
reality, not in ideas, but in things.
"Things are ever chang ing, but the spe-
cies remain." His idea of the ruler of
the universe was a mind eternal. These
great minds were followed by the
founders of such schools as the Stoics
and the Epicurea ns.
698
CHRISTIANITY
J
ESUS was born in Palestine, which
country had been the "Holy Land"
of the Jews.
This part of the world, was at the
time of his birth under Roman govern-
ment, for Rome had indeed by this time
become the "Mistress of the World,"
but many Jewish officials, had charge,
under the Romans, as "Herod the
Great" King over this particular do-
main, it was during his reign that Jesus
was born.
His mother Mary was wife of the
carpenter Joseph. Jesus was brought up
to this trade and followed it till he was
about 30 years old.
Shortly before he reached that age,
his cousin John the Baptist had begun
699
'Ihe ~w Psychology
to preach, that "the Kingdom of God
was at hand" and to baptize men, m
token of their desire to be ready for its
commg. Jesus went to be baptized of
John, and as he was coming out of the
water, a voice from Heaven spoke to
him declaring that he was The Son of
God, and the expected Messiah. Jesus
had been reared among those who shared
the belief in the coming of a Messiah,
who would indeed be not only a Spir-
itual savior, but would be their king,
and assist in the restoration of their lost
glory as a nation.
The conviction that he was to fulfill
these expectations, overwhelmed him
and he retired to the wilderness, to think
out what it meant.
The story of his struggle there is told
in the narrative of his temptation, and
from this struggle he came forth with a
700
Christt'anity
new conception of the Messiahship and
of the kingdom of God.
He put away the political ideal defi-
nitely. That ideal involved the estab-
lishment of a rule over the body of men
by force of arms.
He chose the rule of self-sacrifice and
love.
H_
e staunchly held to a Messianic mis-
sion, but it was to be one of a Spiritual
and not of a political realm.
In His teachings concerning this
Kingdom, Jesus taught that it is every
man's privilege to come under the direct
personal guidance of the God within
himself, as on occasion he would say
to them this: "Said I not unto you, 'Ye
are Gods' " and again, "the Kingdom of
Heaven is within you." This kingdom
was no longer, simply a monarchy, with
God as a far off sovereign; it was a
701
'The ~w Psychology
family of which God was the loving
Father and all men were brothers. The
heart of his message is told in the par-
able of the Prodigal Son.
He chose twelve men from the every
day, simple walks of life, to be his disci-
ples, and companions, and spent more
than a year, traveling here and there in
their company preaching and healing
the sick and when he at last disclosed
to them his conception of Messiahshi p,
they could not understand his uncom-
promising denunciation of sham, his
emphasis for personal righteousness.
The light value h,e set UPON CERE-
MONIAL, set those in higher power
against him, and finally they accom-
plished his death through crucifixion.
Jesus himself wrote nothing, but his
matchless discourses ,and his parables,-
showing his insight into the nature of
702
Christianity
God and man,-were afterwards com-
piled by his disciples, and are now em-
bodied in our New Testament.
The story of the Christian Church,
which was established by the Apostles
soon after Jesus had left them-is a long
one with which we are more or less
familiar. The believers and the Apos-
tles were enthusiastic missionaries and
through the three centuries after Jesus'
death, succeeded in planting the teach-
ings in many countries around the Med-
iterranean Sea.
But at Rome, in Italy, was perhaps
the greatest center, and it was there
that the great Roman Catholic Church
was established and today claims a
larger part of the Christian followers.
In the middle cent~ries, the church
became able to assert its power over the
703
'The ~w Psychology
state and finally became supreme, m
name at least.
About 1300 A.D. men began to find
the need of new ideals, one of which was
for more Religious Liberty-which par-
tially came about through the great re-
ligious reformations, headed by Martin
Luther and John Calvin-from these
came our Protestant churches of the 18th
and 19th centuries, and because of a still
larger liberty, political as well as reli-
gious, our own American Colonies were
formed, and here grew and flourished
such churches as the Presbyterian, and
Methodist, Baptist, and others.
Confucius said, for the races a splen-
did ideal of fine physical attainment-
and no hardier, more capable of endur-
ance, race or races exist, than those who
came within or under his influence.
Almost contemporary, to Confucius,
704
Christianity
was the effect of Zoroaster's great agri-
cultural development, and his lessons in
planetary influence on man and nature,
for Nature herself has to be lifted, as
man is lifted.
Then came the Hebrew race, with the
idea of "Sacrifice" and Egypt, with a
search for the truth as to immortality,
and the working out of the Ethics of a
new civilization.
Buddha's great message, was one of a
deeply spiritual nature, teaching men
the contemplative side of Life, as a
means to man's ultimate goal.
Greece reached God through her love
and creation of the beautiful, and is still
recognized as the mother of art.
Rome gave us government, both indi-
vidual and national-and with these
great fundamentals acquired by man, he
was now ready for another great ideal,
705
The :},(£w Psychology
and Jesus, the Christ, came, "for when
the pupil is ready, the Master will
appear."
In the early part o'f the 19th century,
the Religions of our Western World,
had become a recognized establishment,
namely, Catholicism, and Protestantism
were the two great distinct bodies, rep-
resenting Christianity. By "Western
World," we mean not only the Ameri-
cas, but all of Europe as well.
By this time though, the "Age of Rea-
son," was stirring men's minds, and the
indwelling Spirit, was also stirring some
few to the working of nature's invisible
forces, round and about us.
In Euro J e, philosophy and scientific
research flew to what was, for the time,
very dizzy heights-and in America, at
or around /1850 A.D., much investiga-
tion began.
/ 106
Christianity
A craving for a more definite knowl-
edge as to the soul's immortality, led to
the great wave of what is now called
"Spiritualism," and the organization of
a church by this name. But like all
religions, it has suffered from many per-
versions of its real purpose.
Contemporaneous with the rise of
spiritualism, there were other ideals
being advanced. The old time, or Christ
form of Healing was revived, and then
that great modern American Seer, Poet
and Prophet, Ralph Waldo Emerson be-
gan swaying men's minds, and lifting
them to spiritual heights heretofore un-
dreamed of.
Then came Christian Science and the
New Thought movements, that have
been the means of spiritual and mental
unfoldment-and then another great re-
ligious awakening when Madame Helen
707
l.
'The :N:!.,w
Psychology
P. Blavatsky , came. with her old and
new message of the "Secret Doctrines"
of the Budd hist faith, from which was
established, the Theosophical Society,
and which has even at this early time,
been a means of many modifications m
the New Thought Movement.
