IN1'RODUCTION.
TuE following reply to the "Awful Exposure,"
consists of two parts. Part I. is occupied with
an examination and refutation ofthat book. And Part
II. contains the principal arguments, which may be
adduced in confirmation of Maria l\lonk's "Awful
Disclosures." The work is somewhat more exten-
sive than it was first designed to be ; and yet, in
some respects, it is less full than could be wished,
or than was originally intended. On some points,
the author has failed in his attempts to obtain from
Canada, such information as he has sought for.
It appears that, for some cause or other, several of
his letters sent by mail to gentlemen in Montreal,
have never been received by the persons to whom
. they were directed.
The author has also found an extreme backward-
ness on the part of individuals, especially in Canada,
to furnish such testimony as they possess, in support
of Miss Monk's claims to public confidence; in
some instances, he has met with an absolute refusal;
in others, he has received ::t. strict prohibition to pub·
!ish any thing in c.onnexion with their names. 'I'f1is
is particularly true, as it respects Miss Monk's near-
est relatives, some of whom arc using every means
in their power to induce her to deny the truth of
•

h~r narrative, going so far as even to threaten het
life, if she does not do it. '!'he public will deduce
their own inferences from s~,;rh conduct.
'l'he author would further remark, that his pro-
duction has the usual defects of haste in composi-
tion. From a variety of circumstances, he has felt
himself compelled to hasten his publication, as rnp·
idly as possible. He has done the best he could
under existing circumstances. His sole object has
been to elicit and exhibit the truth, in regard to th3
"Awful Disclosures." He has, therefore, one re-
quest to make of the public, and it Js certainly a
very just one. It is, that he may receive an impar-
tial trial, before he shall be condemned, either as to
his motives or his conduct. The subject i~ extreme-
ly exciting, and is attended with difficulties peculiar
to itself It would be a wonder, therefore, ifhe had
not erred in some minor particulars; but he will ac-
knowledge his errors, whatever they may be, as soon
as they shall be satisfactorily pointed out to him. The
subject is one of deep and solemn interest to the
parties l!oncerned, and all he wishes in regard to
the matter is, that the truth, whatever it may be,
may be brough.t to light.

DENO!Ill:">ATim "AWFUL EXPOSURE OF AN ATROCIOUS. PLOT
FORi\IEO BY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AGAINST THE CLERGY
AND NUNS OF LOWER CANADA, THROUGH THE INTERVEN·
TION OF :MARIA MONK:.
C HA PTER I.
GENERAL REMARKS.
Culp:~ble r.onduct of the priests-Authors of the "Awful Exposure"-
Entitled the Priests' Book-its contents-its style and spirit vulgar-
Clamorouii about matters of trillin[ importance-·Extraneous mattt:r.
Ir Maria Monk be an impostor, the conduct of the
Montreal Roman priesthood is unpardonable. At the
commeacement of the controversy, they ought to have
shown it, so clearly as to have silenced every renson-
a!.lle doubt on the subject. This could have been done
with very little trouble, and have s~~ Yed the world from
the painful excitement which her disclosures have
produced. Had the dvm; of the Hotel Dieu Nunnery
been opened for the inspection of a few impartial ex-
aminers, when she first appealed to the test of exami-
nation, in the August of 1835; or had a single page
of credible testimony been produced, clearly proving
an alibi in her case-the work would have been ac-
complished, and the "Awful Disclosures" would never
ve seen the light.
But very different has been the course pursued by
opponents. They steadfastly refused. for the space
12 REPLY TO THE PRIESTS' BOOK.
of about one year, to subject that convent to the pro-
posed test; and even then refused to have it explored,
except by individuals of their own selecting, such as
were known to be hostile to Miss Monk's claims. 1'he
consequence has been to deep.:>n the conviction on the .
public mind, that her pretensions, as an ex:nun, are ·
founded in truth.
It is true, they collected ancl published to the world
in November, 1835, several afliJavits, the object of
which was to prove tlw < she was unworthy of confi-
dence, and that she had never been a nun. These
affidavits, however, were of such a character as to
produce an effect, opposite to their intention, on the
minds of those who had the means and the ability
intelligently to examine them.
The book recently published in New York, entitled,
"A·wful Exposure of the atrocious plot formed by cer-
tain individuals against the clergy and nuns of Lower
Canada, through the intervention of Maria Monk," is
of such a character, that it will by no means terminate
the dispute between Maria Monk and the priests.
"Wiw is the author?" is an inquiry which naturally ·
springs up in the mind, when we first take up a book
to read, that we have never seen before. In regard to
the book above named, it is believed, that the inquiry
will be mnde in vain. As to authorship, it is name-
less. According to the title page, its publishers are
'Jones & Co., of Montreal." Mr. Jones bas made
different and contradictory statements as to who wrote
it. He has repeatedly alleged hirr.self to be the au-
thor, and as such, responsible for its contents. He
has also said that a gentleman by the name of Mr.
MeGan, was its author. But a Philadelphia priest,
in a letter from Montreal to the Catholic Herald, says,

"I am happy to be able to inform you that there is
forthcoming a most satisfactory review of the Yile
work, (Awful Disclosures,) from the pen of a talented
Scott'!h gentleman of this place." Now, Mr. Jones is
11 French Canadian, and Mr. MeGan an Irishman.
We have then, according to these statements, a trio ol
authors; a Canauian Frenchman, an Irishman, and
Scotchman ; the representatives of three different
nations. The probability is, that neither of them
wrote it.
The book is written in defence of the Canadian
priests anti nuns; and was announced before publica-
tion, and recommended after it, by priests in this am\
other cities. And if crediblP. report be true, money
from the priests' treasury sustained the expense of
getting it up. It undoubtedly has their sanction. I
can, therefore, sec no imr;opriety in calling it, The
Priests' Book. If they did not write it themselves, it
was written for them in their defence, and may at
least, be called theirs in this sense, if in no other.
Having thus found a name for it, let us proceed in our
examination of its contents and general character.* .
The book before us is a small 18mo., containing
about l 30 pages. After the introduction, which con-
tains a fulsome eulogy on the exalted character of the
* I have understood that 1\fr. Jones is endeavoring tc pro-
duce the impression thnt the priests of Lower Canada wholly
disregard this hook-not having purchased a single copy of it.
I trust that none will be gulled by this priestly manrnuvre. It
is undoubtedly the object of the wily priests to conceal them-
selves behind lllr. Jones uuu others, whom they use as the
mere t?ols of their defence. The priests are celebrated for this
mode of warfare. I expect a flourish in respect to this matter.
Perhaps l\lr. Jones will falsify himself, once atleast, in refer·

REPLY TO THE PRIESTS' BOOK..
priest8, nuns, and convents of Lower Canada, we
have 71 pages occupied with U!.:asupported denials of
the truth of Maria Monk's statements, intersper11ed
with jeers and scoffs at her and her friends. Then
comes a chapter of some eight or nine pages as a
"biographical article on the life of Maria Monk,"-
the character of which I forbear naming at present.
The remainder of the book contains affidavits and let-
ters, the object of which is to prove, 1st, that Maria
~ ..unk has never been a nun-2d, that she lived in
sundry specified places dunng the time, which, she
says, she spent in the convent-3d, that she obtained
her nunnery knowledge from thP Montreal Magdalen
Asylum-4th, that she has d~l5cribed the asylum in-
stead of the nunnery-5th, that her character from her
earlie,st youth has been· lewd, lying, thievish, and ad-
venturous-6th, that the father of her child is not
priest Phelan, but or.e Loui!'l Malo of Montreal. Such
is an outline of the priests' book.
Whoever will take the trouble to examine this book
of the priests, wiH find it to be of a character ex-
tremely vulgar, both in its !:tyle and in its spirit. Its
spirit is any thing rather than what it should be. Th1s
is the more to be regretted by the friends of truth, be-
cause of the immense importance of the subject dis-
cussed. Such are ~11 xious to know the truth; and if
Miss Monk is an impodor, they wish to know it, that
they r.- :y treat her and her disclosures accordingly.
On the other hand, if her narrative is essentially true,
they wish to be convinced of it, in order that they may
make such use of it, as the cause ofsuffering humanity
and religion demand. But how will they be repulsed
with the grossness, the bitterness, and the denunci~
atory spirit, of this book ! One thing is very certain,

and that is, if the priests have the truth on their side,
their cause is most wretchedly managed in the pre-
sent instance.
A specimen of the ('r)arse vulgarity spoken cf may
be seen, in the manner in which Miss Monk is gener-
ally spoken of by the priest.;. They call her" Monk
the thief," "the tool Afonk," "the prostitute Monk,"
&.c. &c. In a single chapter she is called "Afonk"
upwards of seventy times. Now, whatever the char-
acter of Maria Monk may he, it can afford no justifi-
cation for so gross a breach on the appropriate use of
language. It both offends and insults the readers
themselves.
The authors of the "Awful Exposure," are very
clamorous respecting matters i;n Maria Monk's book
which are of trifling importance to mankind,-such
as Miss Monk's ignorance of dates-of the proper use
and translation of French phrases-of the correct
spelling of names-of the true names of the different
convents, and of their founders, &c. &c. Now sup-
pose she has erred in these matters, what does it
amount to? If in spelling Bourgeois, she spells it
Bourgeoise, adding the letter e, when, according tc
the priests, it should not be added, what is the mis-
chief done 1 This mistake is more than once gravely
pointed out, by the writers of the "Awful Exposure."
Respecting dates they remark:-" We repeat here that
the utter absence of dates from the pretended 'Dis-
closures,' ought in itself to have been sufficient to
cause their rejection by a man of common sense and
common honesty." This is very remarkable indeed.

lect the dates, when such and such things narrat_
u
·hr her o~-~urrcd! One is instinctively led to as~
whether the writer of this passage can possibly be in
earnest 1 Nuns have little or no occasion to disci-
pline their memories to retain dates. They are pro-
fessedly dead to the world, and all its variations of
time. To them, life is made up of one monoto-
nous round of senseless ce1emonies. Besides, wlJat
is it to the world whether Maria Monk is a correct
·scholar or no, so as accurately to mark dates-to trans-
,late French phrases-to spell names, &c.7 The
great question is, has she correctly delineated the.
character of Canadian priests and Convents 1 But
were it not trifling with the reader's patience, it were
easy to show that most of the charges brought
against her book, in respect to these matters, are with-
out foundation. It were easy to point out two literary
blunders in their own book, for every one that can be
marked in hers. But I forbear, as it would be of no
use to the cause of truth. The assertion, however,
that her book is without dates is untrue, the priests
themselves contradicting it, as will be shown hereaf-
ter. And as for bad spelling in Miss Monk's book,
seeing the priests have so much to say about it, I will
furnish my readers with a single specimen of their
own. They give us an affidavit from a woman,
whose name is spelt at its commencement, Jane Mc-
Coy, but at its close, it is spelt, Jean McKay. If the
priests will point out as great a blunder as this, in
Miss Monk's book, I will yield to them the victory in
point uf spelling. l
There are many statements in the book before us, 1
which have little or nothing to do with the great ques- I

tor, and, of course, her disclosures a mere fiction-
" the vicioug workings of a distempered brain." Eve-
ry thing disconnected with this, will be passed over
unnoticed, as extraneous matter. Among the state-
ments referred to, are those which speak of her vi-
cious habits out of the Convent, and at the very time
she professes to have been a cloistered nun. Of
course, if it be proved that her profession is founded
in truth, then all these assertions, affidavits, &c. must
be so many false aspersions upon her character.

THE " Awful Exposure" devotes one of its chap-
ters to pointing out misrepresentations, said to be con-
tained in Maria Monk's book. This chapter, however,
like several others, is occupied simply with contradic-
tions, and ridicule of het· statements. Maria Monk
declares that certain things and practices existed in
the Congregational Nunnery and in the Hotel Dieu,
during the timt! of her residence in those Convents ;
and her opponents stoutly deny the truth of what she
asserts. Now which of the parties are to be credited 1

a fair trial. And now, at this late period, they give

'JS a book in which, upon their own unsupported au.
t'lority, they flatly contrauict what she says. Again,
. a~k, whom shall we believe 1 Whose conduct best
comports with the appearance of honesty and truth '1.
Maria Monk travelled from New York to Montreal,
and there, upon oath, made her solemn charges against
the inmates and visiters of the Convent; and appeal-.
ed to a simple test, easily applied, by which, if untrue,
they could have been disproved in a single hour..
Certainly, on her part, this looks like honesty, in the
highest degree. On the other hand, the conduct. of
the priests has every appearance of conscious guilt.
Matters being thus, therefore, the unsupported con-·
tradictions of the priests, when placed in the scale op-
posite to Miss Monk's statements, are lighter than a
"puff of empty air."
It is not my design to notice all the particulars,
concerning which, the priests declare that Maria
Monk has made false statefl'\ents. In themselves
con~idered, many of these things are of no consequence.
I shall thl~refore notice only a fe'V of them; eno~gh,
!lowever, to show that the writers of the "Awful Expo·
sure" are as destitute of veracity, as they would fain ·
have us to believe that Miss 1\1. is. I confess that m}r
main object at present is to show, that no confidence
whatever can be reposed in any thing these men say.;
For this purpose I will present my readers with a few
(if I may be allowed to express myself in plain Eng·
lish) of their most palpable lies j take~ irrespective·
of order from different parts their book. ·
It is admitted on all hands, that Maria Monk was'in:
jail for a few days in the month of No·vember, 1834."
She had stated it, and it had been written down be:
fore her opponents ever mentioned it. She states in
20 REPLY TO TB.E PRIJ:8T81

her narrative, that after leaving the Convent she took
passage in a steamboat for Quebec-that the Captain;
mistrusting who she was, detained her as a prisoner,
and brought her back to Montreal-that she escaped
from his boat, quite early in thn morning, and wan-
dered about the city of Montreal-that amidst her suf-
ferings and fears, .abe determined to drown herself,
and accordingly flung herself into the Lachine Canal--
that she wu rescued ere life w,ts extinct, and brought
before Doctor Robertson, whose questions to her, as
to who she was, she declined, from prudential rea~
sons, to answer; aud that h(l, " thinking her to be ob-
stinate and unreasonable, sent her to jail." S\.~ch is
the substance of Maria Monk's statement of the mat-
ter. See Awful Disclosures, p. 262.*
On page 7, of t!1eir book, the priests declare that
she was imprisoned for theft. On page 94, Doctf'r
Robertson says in his affidavit:-" As she could not
give a satisfa~tory account of herself, I, as a Justice
o1: the Peace, sent h~r to jail as a vagrant." Here
then the priests declare that her imprisonment was
(or theft ; while the magistrate who imprisoned her
affirms, that he did it on the ground of her being a
vagrant. Who tells the truth, the priests or Doctor
Robertson '1 One thing is certain, either the priests
have told an untruth for the purpose of sinking the
character of Maria Monk, or their Doctor has perjur-
~d himself. I leave it for them to decide which is
true. I will only add, that the unfeeling paragraph,
on page 66, respecting " Monk's being immured in
the Montreal house of cqrrection," refers to the same
imprisonment: and that what is said on page 74,

especting "Capt. Armstrong's carrying her on board
ois boat to Quebec; and looking upon her as insane
and locking her up in his statc-room,"-evidcntly re-
fers to the voyage which she says she made on board
of his boat, just before her attempt to drown herself in
the Lachine canal. This was in Novl!niher, 1834,
though it is said in the priests' account of it, to have
been in the year 1829. Now it is my deliberate opin-
IOn, that Lhe priests have inserted 1$29, in the place
of 1834. How could Miss Monk's account of the
voyage agree so cxacLly with that of Capt. Arm-
strong's, except the year, unless they both refer to the
same voyage 1 "Awful Disclosures," page 262.
'fhe priests say that Maria Monk was an inmate of
the Montreal Magdalen Asylum, from the close ol
November, 1834, until nbout the beginning of March,
1835. Respecting her conduct while there, on page
78 they say:-" It was even discovered that the se-
clusion of the Asylum, did not prevP.nt her from re-
newing her intercourse with the constable. She re~
ceived his visits, and held converse with him through
the yard enclosure." Now compare this with what
the constable Malo says in his affidavit, page 93. He
affirms that he parted with Maria Monk somttime in
October, 1834, and that he "never heard of her after-
wards, until ailout the early part of the month of
September last, ( 1835. )" Here then· is a direct con-
tradiction between the parties. The priests declare
t:1at the constable paid his visits to Maria Monk du~
ring the winter of 1834-35; while the constable af-
firms Lhat he never heard of her from October, 1834,
until September, 1835. Here again the priests have
f'lbricated a malignant falsehood, in order to asperse
:~nd blacken Maria Monk's character, or Louis Malo

hu perjrtrtd himst'lf. It is to b(.' hoped that th" old
adage will prove true in this instance, that "when
rogues fall out, honest men will get their due." Now
if the priests and their witnesses thus contradict cnch
other, what confidence can be put in the testimon~· of
tither 1
Again, on page 96, we are told-" That there are
four periods mentioned in the' Awful Disclosures,' at
which it is pretended thnt Miss Monk wa!! an inmate
of the Hotel Dicu." What is said here, is :-epeatedly
denied in other parts of their book. On page 8, there
is the following unqualified declaration, expressed in
italics: "In the Awful Disclosures, there i8 not a
lingle date from the commencement to the end !11
Thus this work of the priests broadly asserts 11 thing
in oue place, a;;.::! then as flatly contradicts it in an-
other. A house divided against itseif cannot stand.
On page 67 of their work, it reads thus :-" We cite
the following additional instance of the contradictions
in the 'Disclosures,' and we ask the candid reader if
there can be found language too strong to express the
just abhorrence which the conduct of the advisers of
Monk must inspire. It ii: stated at page 222, that it
was well known to some of the nuns that she had
twice left the convent from choice. Now we defy the
most subtle inquirer to discover from the rrevious
narrative that she had twice left the convent, either
from choice or otherwise.'' If the reader will take the
trouble to look on page 22 of "Awful Disclosures,"
he may read as follows:-" After I had been in the
Congregational Nunnery about two years, I left it,"
&c. Here, then, she tells us that she left the convent
for the first time. On page 34, she tells us that, while
she was 11 novice in the Hotel Dieu, c:he became c!is-

satistit'd on account of certain treatment which ahe
received, and that she forthwith left the establishment.
Here then is the second time of her leaving the con-
vent.
Again, on page 21, we read as follows:-" Another
story is told her (Maria Monk,) by a girl of the school,
nf a murder committed by a priest on the pe!'son of a
1 oung squaw. Why the priest murdered, and why he
then ran away, are most ingeniously accounted for;
at is intimated as a reason for the latter, that timely
notice was conveyed to him in a note by an Indian.''
Maria l\lonk's narrative of this affair may he seen on
page 20, of her book. Sh. states there, that, "a note
was found on his (the priest's) table, addressed to
him, telling him to fly if he was guilty." She does
not intimate that "timely notice was conveyed to him
in a note by an Indian." Thi<:~ is another priesd ~
misrepresentation, made for the purpose of excitiug
contempt for her statements.
In speaking ol' the three convents of Montreal,
Maria Monk says on page 15 of her work, that, ".In
all, large quantities of various ornaments are made by
the nuns, which arc exposed for sale in the orna11,.ent
rooms, and afford large pecuniary receipts every year,
which contribute much to their incomes." On this
passage, the "Awful Exposure•' remarks:-" It is
true, t!Jat at one time articles of fancy were made st
the convent, but those ar<cles were produced for sale
in the !'-ick-wards, anrl .he rroducts expended in pro-
curing additional c .nforts for the sick and infirm.
The sale was t~onfined to strangers, and, as may read-
ily be imagined, was trifling. The custom is now
dropped, and the nuns have sacrificed their 'large
-pecuniary receipts' to the more important objeets o(
24 REPLY TO THE PRIES'l'S' DOOK.
·peace and freedom from impertinence." Now be it
xnown to all the world, that there are fancy articlei
now in this city, (New York, ) in the possession of a
highly respectable and Chri ;;tian lady, whieh she pur-
chased in the Gray and Hotel convents of Montreal,
about the midtlle of last Augu::;t, 1836, and for which
she paid so:ne three or four times their real value.
The.:;e articles, I have both seen and handled, so tha_
t
there can be no mistake in the matter. ·what then
can we think of a set of men, who are so utterly los .
to all truth, as to be capable of fabricating a falsehood,
so palpable, for the sake of making good their decln:-
ration, "that Maria Monk has not made a correct
statement in her book concerning the convents.'.'
This declaration Jones and Leclerc made times al-
mos£ without number in this city, while their book was
publishing. Since the foregoing was penned, Col.
Stone, their recent ehampion, thus contradicts them:
"In each of the apar!!llents visited, articles of fan~y
needlework were produced, sales of ·which are made
for the benefit of the institution. We appeal on this
subject to every person ·who has ever visited the Hotel
Dieu.
It is stated by Maria Monk in ht.r disclosures, that
nuns ·of the Congregational Nunnery, or sisters of
charity, as they are sometimes called, are sent to dif-
ferent parts of the United States, as instructresses of
schools. This her opponents deny, as usual. There
is, however, something rather uncommon about this
.deni.al, viz. a reason assigned for it in these words:-
" 'fhe rules of the foundation expressly limit the
labours of the sisterhood to Canada." God has a rule
also, which is, that men should always speak the truth

rules, whether they be ordained of God, or of them-
selves, if they cross their wishes 1 Now, there is,
or was a short time since:, a f~male, call her a sister
of charity or a Congregational nun, or whatever else
you please, in New York, who is in someway con-
nected with the M')ntrcal convents. H er name is
Miss Keoph, and she is a teacher of young ladies, and
when she gets a company of them suitably bewitched
to go to the Montreal convents ':to finish their educa-
tion," she packs off with them. "When making her
second trip from thia city to CanaJa, some three or
four years ·since, accompanied by six of her pupils,
she travelled in company with my informant, a gen-
tleman of respectability, during the latter part of her
journey. She stated to him that she was connected
with the Congregational Nunnery-that she teceived
her education there--that she had intended to take the
veil; but was refused on the ground of" her levity !"
and was appointed to the work of teaching in the
States. I doubt not, that many more might be found
of the same description in the States on a little in-
quiry~ notwithstanding " their rules limit their labors
to Canada." So much for their "rules."
In describing the ceremonies connected with her
taking the veil, Maria Monk speaks of a coffin into
which she placed herself, as if deud ; thus signifying
her renunciation ol, or 1ather d'ying unto the world:
(and I have no doubt but the prie3ts have wished a
thousand times that her dying had been real in3tead
of farci~al.) The use of.a·coffin on suclt- occasions is
denied by the authors of the book before us. "Is 'it
necessary," they ask, "to say that there is no such
coffin?" I answer, yes, if l\/Iaria Monk is to be con-
tradiCted in all her statements. But if it be asked,
3
26 REPLY TO THE PRIESTS' BOOK.
whether truth demands ir, I answer, no. It is ama-
zing that these men should have the impudence to
insinuate that no such coffin is used on such occa•
sions; when they must know that every person who
has any knowledge on the subject, knows that their
insinuation is untrue. A multitude of witnesses
might be obta: ~ed, if it were necessary, to confirm
Miss Monk's statement. I will mention a Catholie
gentleman, by the name of Guerin dit La Fontain,
who re3ide3 in La Prairie, near Montreal. Thi$
gentleman was recently in New York, and, although
not a believer in the "Awful Disclosures," yet· he
stated that he was present, sometime ~ince, at the
rcceptwn of a nun into the Hotel Dieu, and that on
thllt occas on a coffin was used.
On page 7·'l, we have an account of a voyage made
by Maria Monk to Quebec, on board the Hercu2et
steamer. This, we are told, was in the year 182~.
"On her return to Montreal, her mother was induced
to endeavor to get her received into a Convent." But
Mrs. Monk failed in her endeavor. Three reasons are
mentioned as the ground of her failure. First, Mrs.
Monk's poverty. On page 42, we are informed that
the admission fee into the Nunnery, is "three thou-
sand francs, or about five hundred and sixty dollars."
But· Mrs. Monk was too poor to pay so great a sum;
therefore her daughter could not be admitted into the
Romish " holy of holies." None but the rich, it
seems·, are allowed to eut.er the popish heaven througb
this exalted .channel. Very -charitable, indeed, for a
bouse of charity. Another reason assigneJ ~for Mrs.
Monk's failure is, that "Maria was not a Roman Ca-
tholic," though she expressed a "readiness to become
one." The remaining reason is expressed in the fol-

not asylums for corrected vice, or reformed profligacy,
Maria's previous habits rendered her admittance, even
as a postulante, utterly impossible." In reading this
passage, one is naturally lead to ask-Suppose that
Maria Monk had been as vicious and profliga.te as is
here insinuated, and that she wished to reform and
Jive a life of purity, placing herself beyond the reach

tion of their reforming, :center into the kingdom of

But my design in noticing this passage, is to show
that, what is said here respecting Maria Monk's ha-
bits of vice and profligacy, is as untrue as it is base
and calumnious. The first sentence in the chapter
from which the above extract is taken, is in the fol-
lowing words :-"Maria Monk was born at St.
John's, in Lower Canada, about the year 1817, and
is now in her nineteenth year." It was in the year
1829, we are told, that the application of her mother
to have her received into the nunnery, was refused
for the above reasons. It was seven years ago ; of
course, according to their own showing, she must
have been in her twelfth year! and yet, habituated
in -vic.: and profligacy ! I leave the reader to select
his own language, in which to express his abhorrence
of such mendacity.
The gross absurdities and falsehoo<.os into which
the Compilers of the " Awful Exposure," in their un-
righteous attempts to annihilate the slightest appear-

almost 3$ endles~ as they are sickening to a virtuous
mind. On page 85, speaking of her residence in St
Denis, they say :-" She pursued her adopted profes
sion (school teaching) during the spring, summer
and autumn of 1833, and on the 2d of December ir
the same year, entered the employment of Miss
Louise Bousquet, government School Mistress, as
her English Assistant." Miss Bousquet testifies that
she remained as English teacher in her school about
seven months. The point to which I wish to direct
the attention of the reader, in this co:1nexion, is
this :-That a girl of Maria Monk's alleged charac-
ter 'should have been thus employed as a school
teacher. It seems that this singular compound of
"confirmed vag1·ancy," "strange flightiness and
una'ccountable ir-regularities," "insanity," "thiev-
ery," "lies," and "profligacy," was employed from
the spring of 1833, until the month of July, 1834, as
an English school teacher, in St. Denis! In the fol-
lowing November, they tell us, she entered the Mag-
dalen Asylum, of Montreal, under the management
of "the exemplary and charitable Mrs: McDonell,''
who, "after making oath on the Holy Evangelists,
declared: That she understood.that the said Maria
bad, for many years, led the life of a stroller and a
prcstitute." Several of Mrs. McDonell's pupils in the
Asylum swear to the same thing. Thus we are told
on one page that Maria Monk was teaching schoq
in St. Denis, for some 14 or 15 months: and then on
another, a wholP- tribe of Magdalens, Matron and all
come forward and swear that she was leading, at tha
same time, the life of a wandering prostitute. Oh,
shame, where is thy blush!

ter of Maria Monk unblackened, these men charge
upon her the want of respect towards her mother.
On page 82, they say:-" The conduct of Monk
iowards her mother has always been ungrateful ; and
her habit of indulging in calumnious remarks on her
parent, could be testified to by hundreds of witness·
es." Yes: so could any thing else by such wit-
nesses. It were no great matter to prove, by such
characters, that the sun was a jack-o'·lantern, the
moon a haystack, and the stars, a flock of sheep.
The charge here brought against Miss Monk, by
her imbittered enemies, I am confident, has no foun·
dation in truth. One thing is certain, if ever a child
had cause for unkind feeling towards a parent, it is
Maria Monk. Mrs. Monk has treated her daughter
in a most unfeeling and unparental manner. Her
conduct relating to her pretended affidavit, is unpar-
donable. Alas, that a mother could ever become so
callous in her feelings towards an own child, bone of
her bone, and flesh of her flesh! Mrs. Monk knows,
as well as she knows any thing, that many of the
statements, which she is represented as making in
her affidavit, are untrue. She ought, therefore, to re-
pent for having sold herself to such a body ofunprin-
cipled men, as are the Montreal Romish priests. It
is true, as I believe, she has represented to Maria,
that she never swore to the affidavit which bears her
name ; that the priests carried it to her, and secured
a pwmise from her that she never would contradict
its statements. Hence the fact, that it is without her
signature. This she ought to publish to the world, and
to do all she can to vindicate her daughter, from the
numberless calumnies which are heaped upon her.
On the other hand, the feelings of Maria towards her

mother, since she has been in New York, have been
of a very filial r.haracter, as all who have any know.:-
lcdge on the subject would readily testify. On all
occasions, she goes as far as truth will admit, in vin...
dicating her mother's conduct. Tlie severe, though
perhaps just, remarki on the character of Mrs. Monk,
which are contained in the dissertation published.in
the Appendix to the "Awful Disclosures," from the
hand of a gentleman of this city, have always been
a source of grief to Maria. I well recollect how she
felt when she first saw them; but it was too late
then to make alterations.
On page 73, we have the celebrated pencil story.
It is as follows:-" It appears that Maria, while at
school, had her ear perforated by a slate pencil, and
that a piece of the pencil has remained in _
her ear to
this
1
.day. Her sufferings arising from this cause have
been acute, and have led to the supposition that her
intellect has been from the time of the accident, seri-
ously and badly affected. It is known to medical
jurisconsults, that no question is of more difficult de-
termination than that of alleged insanity. Thus it
has happened that the cause of her malady .still sub-
~ists, and that she still endures its effects." To say
the lea~t, this is a curious piece of historic knowledge.
There are, however, two statements in it, which are
as distant from truth, as the southern from the north;.
ern pole. First, the declaration that a piece of a slate
pencil remains in her ear to this day, is too ridicu-
lously false to deserve hardly a passing notice. The
or_
igin of the story is this; when Maria Monk was
quite a child, she and another little girl were at play,
and they put each into the other's ear a piece of slate
'pencil. Maria say~ the piece in her ear remained for

tively tell, now, whether it was in her right, or in
her left ear. 'I'he assertion, therefore, that it remain!!
to this day in her ear, and that she still suffers from
it, is destitute of thtl least semblance of truth. But
we are told that the pencil remains, seriously affect-
ing her intelll'ct, and prouudng, if not abs<;>lute in~
sanity, "strange flightiness und unaccountable irregu-
larities." But to talk of an effect without a.caus~
is an absurdity ; and in the present case we see tbat
the alleged cause does not exist. Therefore .the al·
leged effect cannot exist. If Maria Monk is insane,
it is unaccountable that none of her friends in New
York have ever been able to discover the least indica·
tions of it. When her friends call to mind ~hat .she
has passed through since she left the convent, they
wonder that she has not been driven to insanity.
Not one female in ten thousand would have endure4
the ordeal, through which !:ihe has been enabled to
pass without injury. 'With an infant in her arms,
she commenced the contest. She told her sad· tale;
but scarce anybody was prepared to believe it. It
was too horrible for belief. Hence all about her was
suspicion. Her circumstances were suspicious. She
was examined, re-examined, and cross-examined by
every sort of people. She has been persecuted by
Catholics and by Protestants. Malice has direct:

in the multipled charges of im1
anity whieh arf! made
against her in the "Awful Expc:iure 1" Sad indeed
must be the predicament of truth, if it needs for its
support such weapons.
But this charge itself is one of the proofs of her
haviiJg been a nun. It appears to be the standing or-
der to charge upon every female who makes disdo·
sures, disadvantageous to convents, madness and in-
aanity. Rome set the example. Says Scipio de
Ricci, "they say at Rome, to defend the Monks, that
the two nuns are mati ; but up to the present hour, no
one has ever taken them for such." Thus Miss Reed
was mad or insane, and also Miss Harrison, and now
:Maria Monk.
"Among the instructions given us by the priests,"
says1
Maria Monk, "some of the most pointed were
those directed against the Protestant Bible. They
often enlarged upon the evil tendency of that book, and
told us t~at but for it many a soul now condemned to
hell, and s~.ffering eternal punishment, might have
been in happiness. They could not say any thing
in its favor;. for that would be speaking against re-
ligion and against God. They warned us against it
as Q. thing very dangerous to our souls." In com-
menting on this passage, the "Awful Exposure" be-
comes quite wa,rm and wrathful. It is denounced as
the" language of a New York Conventicle." "It is
~Jt~erly incredible, nay, impossible in the ordinary
(!OUrse of things, that the language Mcribed to the
pr~es\s should ~- ;re been used by them." " The word
ofGod is the Christian's text, Protestants and Catho-

tion. In 1713, Pope Clement XI. i'Ssued·the celebra;..
ted bull Unigenitus. In this he condemns . certain
"Moral· reflections on the New Testament," ·by Fa;.
ther Quesnel, stigmatizing them as ""fah·e, captious,
schocking, offensive to.pious ears: scandalous, perni•
cious, rash, seditious, impious, blasphemou!l." Among
the reftectiuns thus unmercifully condemned by "his
holiness," the following are to be found: that ·" it.is
useful and necessary, at ·all times, in:all places, ;and
for all sorts of persons, to study and· know the spirit;
piety, and mysteries of the Holy Scripture;" that "the
reading of the Holy Scripture is for everybody-;"
that '' t:te Lord's day ought to be sanctified by Chris.;
tians in reading pious bocks, and above all, the Holy
Scriptures." In 1816, Pope Pius VII. writing to the
Archbishop of Gnezn, calls the Bible Society a ·" most
c:rafty device:' .vhich the very foundations of religion'
are undermi~ed,'' a "pestilence," and" defilement of
the faith, most imminently dangerous to souls." Pope'
Leo XII. in 1824, speaking of the same institution,
says that it " strolls with effrontery throughout the·
world, contemning the traditions of the Holy Fathers,
ind contrary to the well known decree of the Coun-'

.eil of Trt.lf ~lbors with all its might, and by every
means, to translate or rather to pervert, the Holy Bi-
ble into the vulg1n languages of every nation." Thus
bitter are the popes against a society which labors
to furnish mankind with the word of God, in lan-
guages which they can read. Bu~ as the subject is of
such vital importance, and as some Catholics admit
that popes may err in their decisions, but all agree
that a general council sanctioned by a pope cannot,
I will here subjoin the fourth rule of the Congrega-
tion of the Index, of the Council of Trent, which is
the last general council ever held by the Romish
Church. It is as follows:-" Inasmuch as it is mani-
fest from experience, that if the Holy Bible, transla-
ted into the vulgar tongue, be indiscriminately allow-
ed t,o every one, the temerity of men will cause more
evil than good to arise from it, it is, on this point, re-
ferred to the judgment of the bishops, or inquisitors,
who may, hy the advice of the priests or confessors,
permit the reading of the Bible translated into the
Yulgar tongue by Catholic authors, to those persons
whose faith a.;tU piety, they apprehend, will be aug-
mented, and not injured by it; and this permission
they must have in writing. But if any one shall have
the presumption to read or possess it witho11t such

shall neither read nor purchase such Bibles withou&
n special license from their superiors."
Trul y, the Bible must be a very bad book, or ir,fal-
lihility must have erred in this instance. The truth
is, there is no book in the world so destructive to
Catholicism as is the Bible. It is not to be wondered
at, therefore, that general councils, popes, bishops,
and priests, are so anxious to lock it up in a language
which the people do not understand. Nor is it to be
wondered at, tha~ wbtn the people become so rebel..
liou~ as to demand it in their mother tongue, their
priests put them oti with something as remote from
the true Bible, as they can possibly satisfy them with.
Hence, in different countries the people have different
Bibles, graduated according to the light with which
they are surrounded. In countries where there are
but few heretics, a mere primer, called the Bible, will
answer every purpose. A curious specimen of this
was observed by the learned and pious Daniel Wilson,
bishop of the Episcopal church in the East Indies,
during his travels in the summer of 1833, on the con-
tinent of Europe. Says he, "as I walked down the
hill, I asked our guide if he had a Bible. He told me
he had, and that he read it constantly. I asked him
a few questions about the Old and New Testament
history ; when I discovered that his Bible was a pam-
phlet of eighteen or nineteen pages, drawn up by the
priests. He had no idea that there was any boo1t
such as we mean by the Bible-so sad is the igM-
rance of these poor people." Here is popery in i~­
meridian splendors, if darkness have splendors. H9W
numerous are the tricks of Roman priests to counter-

· The priests contradict the statement of Miss Monk,
1hat ·nuns, on.their reception, have assigned to them
"the names of saints, as St. Mary, St. Eustace, St.
!Frances, &c. They also deny that priests, with the
·exception of the chaplain of each, ever visit either the
Hotel Dicu or the Congregational nunneries. These
denials are so notoriou!'ly untrue, that it is matter of
.astoni~hment, how the priests were ever so foohsh as
to m'ake them. Aslr almost any female, Catholic or
·Protestant, who ever attended the Congregational
·nunnery school, and ~he will tell you at once that the
·priests are in error. They deny Maria Monk's state-
·ment that there are about one hundred and fifty priests
connectE:d. with the seminary of Montreal, which is a
place of general rendezvous for all the pnests in the
·districtofMontreal. Now they do not deny that there
·are this number of priests in the district, nor that they
all occasionally resort to the seminary; but they deny
'that all are <'Onnected with the seminary as an incor
porated body. This is marvellous. They also deny
Miss Monk's statements respecting the number ot

inform it; and it is doubtles~ their policy to produce:
the belief that the number of novices and nuns is
-nuch smaller tha!l it really is. The fact, that the
committee who examined the Hotel Dicu in July last,
and since then Col. Stone, found the number of nuns
to agree with the statement of this old almanac, has
led some to doubt Maria Monk's statement as to their
number. Such should remember that it is a very
easy matter for the priests to remove as great a num-
ber as they choose. They call remove them to the
Quebec Hotel Dieu, and to the nun's island, and to
other fillhy establishments, which the priests have
scattered about Lower Canada. I will here add, that
what they say about certain legislative enactments,
requiring girls to be of a certain age before "they can
take the religious habit," and also that they should
sign some kinrl of a deed, attested by others, &c., may
be true, or untrue; none the more either way, how-
ever, for their saying so. But if such enactments ex-
ist, they are observed or not, doubtless, just as it suits
the pleasure of the priests. What civil magistrate
ever entered the cloistered apartments of the Hotel
Dieu, in order to ascertain whether or not such laws
were obeyed 1 To the proof of this we challenge
them; they might as well show us the law of God to
prove their holiness. The priests conclude what they
have to say about Miss Monk's misstatements in rela-
tion to the Congregational Nunnery, as follows:-
'!We have examined all the representations concern-
the Congregational nunnery, and we have shown
them to be false in every instance." Now I have
taken pains to converse somewhat extensively with
several ladies who have been educated, to a greater or

Miss Monk's representations of that nunnery are gen-
erally very cnrrect. The subjoined statement is from
one who was there about three years. Her name is
suppressed for several reasons, all of which are justi-
fiable in her case. The fullest credit, however, may
be reposed in her testimony, for she is a lady of char-
acter and standing, and a member of the Protestant
Episcopal Church•
. "I was at the school in the Congregational Nunnery
of Montreal nearly three years. When I entered the
school I was a Protestant ; but I had not been th~re
more than three months before my faith was shaken :
and I began to think that the Catholic religion was
the only true religion. I was young, and nearly all
my 'companions were Catholics, and I had none but
Catholic books to read. I at length became unwaver-
ing in my Catholie belief.
. "My impressions respecting the cloistered life of the
nuns, were of the most exalted kind. My feelings at
length became so excited that I determined to taka
the veil. I felt that there was no other way for me
to secure the salvation of my soul. I felt that I had,
what they call in the nunnery, a calling to become a
cloistered nun. I never have been able to this day,
to understand how my mind arrived to such a degree
of excitement, for I was all but distracted, such was

lived at some distance, with the fixed determination
to enter the Hotel Dieu on my return; but they, un-

Maker for so ordering it in His kind Providence.

correct. I can't doubt for a moment but what she
has been a scholar in the nunnery, as she states in her
book.
"The fact that her descriptions of the Congregation-
al Nunnery are so correct, has alwayg led me to be-
lieve what she says of the Hotel Dieu ; though the
description is so awful that I am sometimes led to
doubt its truth. But then when I recollect what I
have read, seen, and heard, of the character of Roman
priests, my doubts vanish. I have thought a thou-
sand times of a remark that priest Larkin, who was
professor of Moral Philosophy in the College at
Montreal, made to us one day in the public school-
room. It was this: he said if he was able he would
hang every Protestant there was on the face oJ. the
earth. Though I was a Catholic then, my feehngs
were shocked at such a remark."
Here it seems was Father Larkin, although not the
chaplain of the nur nery, instructing the young ladie13,
and endeavoring to imbue their minds with the true
spirit of Romanism.

·· FoR the priests to prove an ~libi in the case of
Maria Monk, provided it be true that she never was
a nun, must be a task easily accomplished. They
possess every imaginable facility for doing it. They
are dispersed over the entire face of Canada, and
nearly all the inhabitants in the province are dispo-
sed to render them every assistance in their power to
accomplish it. By their management, they have
created a strong popular prejudice in favor of their
cause, and against Miss Monk. Indeed, such is the
state of feeling in Canada, that it is almost impossi-

know. Public opinion rides over every law, both hu-
man and divine.
Matters being thus, no evidence which the priests
or their advocates may offer in proof of an alibi, ought
to be received, unless it be of an unexceptionable
c!taracter. The reason is extremely obvious. The
momentous importance of the subject demands it ;
and if it be true that Maria Monk has never been a
cloistered nun, it is an easy matter to produce such
evidence iu proof of it. If Maria Monk was, as is
maintained, at service for some ten or eleven months
in Sorel, and some six months in St. Denis, and for
some fourteen or fifteen months a school mistress in
the same place, at the very time she professes to have
been in the nunnery-it must be a matter of public
notoriety. Hence there can be no difficulty in furnish-
ing unexceptionable testimony of the fact, if it be so.
Ought the testimony of Roman Catholics, unsup-
ported by respectable Ptotestants, to be received as
such evidence ? I answer, no. The reason is obvi-
ous. It is h!l established principle, acted on for ages
in the Catholic church, " that the end sanctifies the
-means." And according to this principle, he is a
good Catholic that falsifies his word, if by so doing
he may thereby promote a good end; and what end,
in the eye of a faithful Catholic, is so precious as the
honor of his church? Among C~tholics the priest·
hood constitutes the church. Hence every Roman
Catholic on earth is bound, by his religion, to defend
the priesthood, right or wrong. No intelligent reader
of Catholic authors will dispute the truth of this posi
tion. Let me not be misundt>rstood; I speak now
with reference to a single point-that of defending
the honor· of the Romish church .; and I speak of

thorough going Catholics, not nomiual ones Jiving
amidst intelligent Protestants.
The first testimony presented to us in the "Awful
Exposure," is that of Charles Gouin, of Sorel. He
states that Maria Monk was a servant girl in his fam-
ily, from the mvnth of November, 1831, until Sep-
tember of the following year. This testimony is
either true or false : if true, it overthrows Maria
Monk's claims as an eloped nun. That it is false,
there can be no- doubt. Mr. Gouin is stated, by very
respectable authority, to be a Roman Catholic, so far
as he has any religion. A man notoriously destitute
of moral principle; a bankrupt, owing much and pay-
ing litrle. He is described by his own friends, as
"an active conspirator, unworthy of confidence·."
Before presenting counter testimony, I wish to put
my readers in possession of all the evidence which
the priests have furnished in confirmation of Mr.
Gouin's statement. A woman by the name of Mary
Angelica Monk, of Sorel, makes oath that Maria
Monk was in her service as a domestic, one week in
the autumn of 1832. She states that she understood
that Maria had been a servant girl in the family of
Mr. Gouin. 'Vho then is this Mary Angelica Monk 1
We are told by the priests, that she is not a relative
of Maria Monk ; and it is very certain, from respecte
able testimony received here, that her relationship
would be no honor, either to Maria Monk, or to any
other person. She is an impure woman ; having
been separated from her husband, on the ground of her
criminal connexion with a man by the name of Hall.
Report also says, that she is very intimate with the
notoriously profligate priest Kelly, of Sorel. Of what
value, then, is the testimony of such a pe.rson 1

The statements of Mr. Gouin and Mrs. Monk; are
confirmed by the testimony of one Martel Paul Hus
Cournoier. The affidavit of this man has every
appearance of having been fabricated, for the sole
purpose of bolstering up, not only the testimony of
Mr. Gouin and Mrs. Monk, but also that of other in-
dividuals, to be examined hereafter. He is described
by those who know him, "as an illiterate fellow, who
can neither read nor write ; an active speculator, of
no property, little credit, reputation for virtue or in-
tegrity ; having not long since debauched one of his
own creed named Couthnay." He was convicted of
perjury in the case of the King ~.gainst Isaac Jones
and others, for the murder of Louis Marcoux. If any
man in Canada doubts the truth of this, he is refer-
red to the legal registers of that Province, for the
proof of it. Such, then, is the unprincipled charac-
ter of Martel Paul : and I ask, what confidence can
be reposed in the affidavit of such a perjured igno-
ramus?
Here, then, is the testimony adduced by the priests,
to prove that Maria Monk resided in Sorel, as a serv-
ant girl, for some ten or eleven months of the time
which she alleges herselfto have passed in the Hotel
Dieu nunnery, of MontreaL And that it is false, is
evident from the following reasons:-
1. The individuals thus testifying, have little or no
character for veracity. This the priests well knfw,
and they never would have rested their cause on
such testimony, if they could have procured better.
Can any man believe, that if Maria Monk had resi·
ded for ten or eleven months in Sorel, the priests could
not have obtained such evidence of the fact, as would
have challenged even sm~picion itself! Sorel or Wil- .

liam Henry, is a small place on the southeastern
bank of the St. Lawrence river, containing about
fifteen hundred inhabitants, so that each individual
of the town is generally known to every other.
Hence, if Maria Monk had been there, as is main-
tained by the priests, she would have been generally
known b}· the inhabitants of that village ; and the
testimony of any number could have b;;•:.n 1btained.
2. Maria Monk declares that she nev~r was in
Sorel; and it is very evident that she is altogether
ignorant of the place, except what she knows from
mere report. Before she had seen Dr. Robertson's
affidavit in Nov. 1835, she was examined with refer-
ence to her knowledge of Sorel, and it was evident
that she knew nothing about it. I took special pains
to ascertain, before she knew any thing of the priests'
attempt to prove that she had resided in Sorel, whether
she knew their witnesses. She evidently had never
heard of Mr. Gouin, and Mr. Paul ; but of Angelica
Monk she had some knowledge, as she had formerly
resided near her mother's, in Montreal.
3. All the multiplied and varied evidence of her
having been a nun, hereafter to be offered to the read-
er, proves that the testimony of these witnesses is
false.
4. Mr. Buttery, a reputable merchant of Sorel, was
in New York in June or July last, and called upon
Maria Monk. This was before the priests' book
made its appearance, but Doctor Robertson, of Mon-
treal, had given it as his opinion, formed on mere
hearsay testir.'lony, that she had resided, during the
summer of 1832, in Sorel. Special pains, therefore,
were taken to ascertain whether Mr. Buttery and
Maria Monk had ever seen each other before, and it

was evident to those present that they never had.
Mr. Buttery declared, that it was impossible for her
to have resided in Sorel, as above stated, without his
having had some knowledge of it. He was, there·
fore, decidedly of the opinion that she had never liv-
ed in that place. Mr. Buttery lives near Mr. Gouin's,
and would of course have seen her, had she lived
there for ten months.
5. The following testimony of Mr. John Edler, of
New York, is decisive on the point. Mr. Edler first
became acquainted with Maria Monk some time in
the summer of 1836, in the city of New York. His
statement is as follows:-
"I have friends, a grand-parent and a brother, re-
siding in Sorel or William Henry, whom I have fre-
quently visited in that place. My mother resided
there before her decease. I am personally acquaint-
ed with Mr. Charles Gouin and his family, who keep
a tavern in Sorel, Their residence is in the immedi-
ate vicinity of my relatives. On one occasion Ire-
sided with my connexions in Sorel, for about the
space of nine months, immediately preceding the
commencement of the Cholera in July, 1832. Du-
ring this period I was often at Mr. Gouin's, and per-
sonally knew the members of his household; an·d
I am very certain that Maria Monk, authoress of
the " .Awful Disclosures," was not, during this period
of time, a member of Mr. Gouin's family, in any
sense whatever. Nor did ! ever henr of her living in
Sorel, until I recently heard of it in New York. I
first became acquainted with Maria Monk in New
York, some three or four months since."
Mr. Edler's testimony covers eight out of the ten
:nonths: during which time, Mr. Gouin says, that
46 REPLY TO THE PRIESTS' BOOK.
Maria Monk was a menial in his family. Mr. Edler,
&o far as I have been able to ascertain, is a young
gentleman of veracity and industry. His statement,
therefore, can be relied on as true.
Since writing the above, a lady from Sorel has
visited Maria Monk in New York. And she gives
it as her decided opmion, that the authoress of the
"Awful Disclosures" has never been a resident of
Sorel, as testified by the priests' witnesses. Thus
the evidence, that Charles Gouin, Martel Paul Hus
Cournoier, and Angelica Monk, have given false tes-
timony, is constantly augmenting.
It is evident, therefore, that Maria Monk, authoress
of the "Awful Disclosures," has not resided iu Sorel,
as maintained by the priests and their perjured sup-
porters. It seems, however, that a person assuming
the name of Maria Monk, rlid reside at Mr. Gouin's
in Sorel, at the time specified. A gentleman of char-
acter and standing, who appears .to have faithfully
examined the matter, writes as follows :-" From all
then that I can ascertain-and it is in the mind of
others-I suspect that a ll.faria Monk was made by
the priests and nuns of Montreal, in anticipation of
what should follow from the disclosures of the true
Maria Monk after leaving the convent." This is a
right priestly trick-what the venerable Baxter would
denominate "Jesuit juggling." Who can fathom the
depths of their deceptive workings-prophetically
called by the Apostle Paul, "the deceitfulness of all
unrighteousness 1" The &!'ts of deception have been
cultivated by them, now, for more than one thousand
years.
After Maria Monk left Sorel, we are told by the
pnests, that she went to reside in St: Denis. Here

she resided, it is said, .rom the month of October,
1832, until the month of July, 1834, ahout one year
and nine months. They tell us that she was em-
ployed as a domestic servant for the first six months,
in the family of Mrs. St. Germain; and the remainder
the time in school-t.~aching. All the witnesses
by the priests, to prove her residence in St.
is, are Roman Catholics; two out of the five :>re-
ted are incapable of writing their names.
Mrs. St. Germain, styled in her affidavit Angelica

We have an affidavit from a young man, by the

the St. Lawrence suburbs of Montreal. He testi-
that he "attended a school kept by the so-called

lie also says that he saw the said Maria on the 29th
day of June, 183·1, in St. Denill. He further declares
that in the summer of 1835, Maria Monk, accompanied
" by a man dressed in black," called on him, at the
Lar of Philip Lavoie!, tavern keeper in the St. Law-
rence suburbs, where he resided, and requested him to
write a letter to Miss Louise Bousquet of St. Denis,
and invite her to come to Montreal and receive two
hundred pounds currency, which Maria had for her.
We shall see more of this currency matter; when we
come to examine the testimony of Louise Bousquet.
The testimony of this young man is evidently a
compound of truth and.falsehood. While Miss Monk
was an assistant teacher to Miss Bousquet, in St
Denis, this young man, then but a boy, attended her
school. The man "dressed in black" was Mr. Hoyt;
ne and Miss Monl:c called on him, as he states. Their
object was to learn, if possible, the precise time that
Miss Monk was employed as assistant teacher to
Louise Bousquet. He thought that it was in the year
1829 or 1830. His statement, therefore, in his affida-
vit, that he attended her school in the summer of 1833,
is manifestly untrue. There is something on the very
face of it, which strongly indicates it to be so. He
was quite a youth, being a bar-keeper when Mr. Hoyt
and Miss Monk called on him, in th~August of 1835,
which was about two years from the time he says, in
..is affidavit, that he attended her school. In 1833, he ·
must have been some fourteen'or fifteen years of age.
The idea, therefore, that a youth of his age should
attend. on the i1

ble; especially in a country town, in the heart of the
summer, when the business of the fnrmer is most ur-
gent. Moreover, his statement that he was requested
by Maria Monk, to write to Louise Bousquet and in·
form her, that if she would come to Montreal she
should receive two hundred pound!! currency, is so
absurdly false as to show that little or no confidence
can be put in whatever he may say.
Another witness is Martel Paul Hus Cournoier.
He states that he knew of Maria Monk residing in
St. Denis; but he does not tell us when it was. The
worthless character of this man has been already
noticed.
The only remaining testimony to be examined is
that of Louise Bousquet.
Maria Monk states in her Disclosures, that while a
novice in the Hotel Dieu, she became displeased, and
left the convent and went to St. Denis, aQd ea1gaged
as an assistant teacher in the Government school to
Louise Bousquet. She states that she remained with
Miss Bousquet about three months, and then returned
to the convent. Miss Bou!'quet testifies to ti.e fact, '
that Maria Monk was at one time in her employment,
as an assislant teacher. There is, therefore, an agree-
ment between them, as to the fact, that they were
once associated together as instructresses of children
in St. Denis j but in evE'ry thing else they disagree.
Miss Bousquet contradicts every statement that
Maria Monk has made in her book, which is in any
way connected with her, except it be the one just
noticed. The only point of importance, however, re·
spects the time when Miss Monk was associated with
her, as teacher in St. Denis. Miss Bousquet affirms
that it was from December, 1833, till July, 1834-,-the-
5
50 hEPLY TO TilE PRIESTS' 0001:.
very time when Miss Monk declares that she was a
nun in the Hotel Dieu. There are two things in
Miss Bousquet's affidavit, which especially give to
her testimony the appearance of fabrication: 1. The
fact that she denies all Miss Monk's statements re-
specting her, some of which are of no importance,
with the single exception of the one that they were
associated together in teaching school. This looks
like art, not like the utterings of simple nature or
truth. She does not contradict Miss Monk's state-
ments in the gross, but in the detail, :me after another·
2. Her statement that she received two letters in the
month of August, 1835, one in English, signed
"Hoyte," which she "remained ignorant of because
she could not read English:" the other in French,
signed "Ambroise Vigeaut," which invited her to go
to Montreal and receive two hundred pounds curren-
cy," which a lady in Montreal was commissioned to
give her." She tells us that she proceeded to Mon•
treal, and called on Ambroise Vigeaut, who informed·
her that the lady was Maria Monk. She then called
on Maria's mot~er, " who in an angry manner burned
the letters on the spot," saying " that her daughter
was a victim anrl an unfortunate." Now the mean·
ing of all this is, that Mr. Hoyt and Miss Monk wish·
ed to bribe her, with two hundred pouni.s currency, to
testify that Maria Monk had been a nun in the Hotel
f, Dieu-thus insinuating that a vile conspiracy had
t be.en formed against the nunnery. This is known,
however, to be absolutely false, for Miss Monk com·
municated her principal statements respecting the·
Hotel Dieu, before she ever saw or heard of Mr.
Hoyt; as will be seen hereafter. Besides, Mr. Hoyt and'

hundred pounds currency. How then could they offer
it 1 But suppose that they had wished to bribe her.
Would they have offered her two hundred pounds,
currency, when the fiftieth part would have answered
every purpose 1 Would they have sent her a letter
in English, which Maria Monk must have known she
could not read 1 Would they thus foolishly have ex-
posed themselves to detection 'I Would they have
employed Ambroise Vigenut to make her the offer in
French, when Maria Monk could have done it herself,
and thus have kept him out of the secret 1 The whole
affair is absurd and false. Of what value then is the
testimony of Louise Bousl}uet, and of Ambroise Vi-
geaut1
Thus we have reviewed all the evidence which the
priests have produced, to prove that Maria Monk resi-
ded at St. Denis, from October, 1832, until July, 1834.
Setting asidv the fact, that all the witnesses are Catho-
lics, the mere tools of the priests, their testimony
bears internal marks offabrication. Had Maria Monk
resided twenty-one months in St. Denis, how easy a
matter for the priests to adduce such proof of the fact,
as would remove every reasonable doubt on the sub-
ject!
The inhabitants of St. Denis are nearly all of them
Catholics. Hence the difficulty of obtaining any tes-
timony from that place, which would be favorable to
Miss Monk's claims, and which would, as a matter
of course, militate against the cause of the priests.
Even the few Protestants there, are so intimately con-
nected with the Catholics, that they cannot do any
thing on the subject, without securing to themselves
consequences highly disagreeable. I wrote to a gen-
tleman of that town, requesting his assistance in the
•I

·matter; and the following is an extract from his re.
ply :-" I am sorry to say I am unable to meet with
your views, as I cannot give you any information re·
specting her (Maria Monk) from personal knowledge;
and I must at the same time posr:tively decline making
the inquiries you desired me to make, as it might,
and would lead to consequences highly disagreeable
to myself hereafter." I would here observe that such
is the situation of this gentleman, that if Maria Monk
had resided in St. Denis, as maintained by the priests
and sworn to by their vassals, he must have had some
"personal knowledge" of her.
Another serious difficulty with which I have met
in attempting to secure such an investigation of the
matter, as I have wished, has been the interception of
.letters, as I suppose in the Post-office at Montreal•
.Since receiving the one, from which an extract is ~iv­
en above, I have written several letters to gentlemen
in Montreal on the subject, which appear never to
have been received, by those to whom they were ad·
dressed. I do not say who has done this. I simply
state a fact, and leave my readers to make their own
inferences.
1'he following statement, as will he seen, is direct·
ly to the point. It is presented without being sworn
to, and without the young man's signature. It is
proper that I should state the reason of this. It is
simply the fact, that all his friends are Catholics, and
.of course unwilling that he should do any thing to
establish the truth of Maria Monk's claims. A short
time since I had an interview with him, when he very
readily communir.ated to me the facts contained in this
statement. At that time he was uncertain, whether

1831, that Maria Monk was assistant teacher to Louise
Bousquet in St. Denis; but he thought, however, he
could ascertain by examining his papers. This he
agreed to do, and to call on me the Saturday follow-
ing--it being on Monday we had the interview.
During the intervening time, I arranged the facts
which he communicated to me, leaving a blank for
dates to be filled when he should call according to his
agreement; when i expected that he would confirm
the whole on oath. Saturday arrived, but he did not
rall, as he engaged to do. During the following
week, I engaged a gentleman to visit him in Brook-
lyn, and have him fill the blank dates, correct any
error which might exist in the statement, and confirm
it before a magistrate. The gentleman called on htm
and read to him the statement, but he declined to con-
firm it on oath: or to have his name published in con-
nexion with it, as that would offend his friends in
Canada, and he felt himself to be among strangers
here. He stated that he had received a letter from
his brother, stating that it was in the summer of 1833,
that Maria Monk was in St. Denis. I have been thuH
particular in detailing these facts, in order that the
public may be enabled to judge ia the matter. The
statement that Maria Monk was connected with
J,ouise Bousquet's school in the summer of1833, r.on-
tradicts all the testimony which the priests have pro-
ducerl on the subject. Louise Bousquet, as we have
seen, testifies that it was in the summer c!' 1834.
This Canadian tampering does not help the matter.

"I was born and brought up in St. Denis, Lower
Canada, where most of my relatives still live. I am
acquainted with Maria Monk, authoress of ' Awful
Disclosures.' I first became acquainted with her in
the year of 1830, or 1831, in St. Denis. She was then
an assistant teacher, as I understood, in the Govern-
ment school, taught by one Louise Bousquet. She was
frequently at my mother's house, as my three brothers
younger than m}'Self attended her school, two of

she bad been residing for several weeks in St. Denis,
I left home, and went to reside for two months in
Montreal. When I returned home in the latter part
of the summer, 1 inquired for the little English girl,
as we used to call het', and was informed by my
mother and others that she had left St. Denis. Af-
ter this I never knew nor heard any thing as to where
she was, until after she published her 'Disclosures'

Three things are rendered very clear by this man's
testimony :-1st, That Maria Monk was in St. Denis
but a short time, as stated in her "Disclosures." 2d,
That during this time she was connected with Lou-
ise Bousquet's school. 3d, That she was not connect-
ed with the families before mentioned. And thus
her account of her residence in St. Denis, is con-
firmed.
'V'e are told that Maria Monk proceeded directly
from St. Denis to Montreal, and entered into the ser-
vice of Charles D. S. Lov1s, where she remained
from the 12th of July, 1834, until the 7th or 8th of
the following month. Mr. Lovis testifies that, while
she was in his family, "she was often deranged in
her mind;" and that she expressed a wish "to be-
come a Roman Catholic, and be baptized." Mr.
Lovis is a Roman Catholic, and his testimony is to
be received as such. The following statement of
Mr. Jones, one of the publishers of the " Awful Ex-
posure," made at the interview which he and his
coadjutor, Mr. Le Clerc, had with Miss Monk, in
New York, on the 17th of August, 1836, does much
towards overthrowing the affidavit of Mr. Lovis :-
"Mr. Lovis, of Montreal, told me that Maria Monk
left his service in July, 1834; and about that time
Fanny Johnson came to live with us. She stayed
with us about a week, and was dismissed on account
of her negligent habits. She answered the descrip-
tion given by Mr. Lovis so well, and having declared
that she came from Mr. Lovis', I was strongly im-
pressed with the belief that they ·were the same per-
son. But now I see my mistake. You (Miss Monk)
56 REFLY TO THE PRIESTS' BOOR:,
are not Fanny Johntaon." There is no doubt but that
f Mr. Lovis, (provided he is an honest man,) should
see Miss Monk, he would also see his mistake, and
see that his Maria Monk was Fanny Johnson, or
some other person.
That the affidavit or' Mr. Lovis is false, I hav(: not
the least doubt. 1. We have seen that Maria Monk
did not come to his house directly from St. Denis, in
July, 1834; for it is evident that she was not in St.
Denis during that year. 2. The above statement of
Mr. Jones is enough to show that Maria Monk was not
in his service ; but that .t was one Fanny Johnson.
3. Mr. Lovis' declaration that "she was often de
ranged in her mind," during the three or four weeks,
that, he says, she was in his service, is evidently un·
true of Maria Monk, and is enough in itself to show
that his testimony is unworthy of the least confi~
dence. They tell us that she was a teacher in the
Government school for a long time, immediately pre~
ceding this; and would a deranged person have been
thus employed 1 Besides, she has evinced no symp-
toms of derangement during her residence in New
York, for the last year and a half. Doctor Robert~
son, of Montreal, who examined her hands some
three months afterwards, states in his affidavit, that
"From the appearance of her hands, she evidently
had not been used to work." It is very manifest
from the whole appearance and conduct of Miss
Monk, that she has never been a servant girl in any
family. This is the decidec~ opinion of the families,
in which she has resided since she came to New
York. Hence the affidavits of Mr. Gouin, and Mrs.
Angelica Monk, of Sorel, and of Mrs. St. Germain,
of St. Denis, anti Mr. Lovis, of Montreal, all of them

testifying, that she has been at service in their fami-
lies,-are undoubtedly false.
W c have next a statement from one Lawrence
Kidd. This consists of a conversation which he had
sometim~ in the summer of 1834, with Capt. Ryan,
"master of a steamer." Mr. Kidd state!! that "Capt.
Ryan told him that Monk had journeyed on board
his boat from SorJ'i to Montreal ;" and that he
had lost his watch, and that he suspected that
"Monk" had stolen it.-The priests think that this
must have been after she left the service of Mr.
Lavis. But what does it all amount to '1 Mr. Kidcl
says, that Mr. Ryan told him thus and thus. An<l
who is Capt. Ryan '1 He is a miserable atheist;
ejected, on account of his vile atheism, from his of-
fice, by the government authorities. Of what value
then is his idle tale '1
We are furnished in the next place with a long
affidavit from one Louis Malo, a constable of Mont-
real. He tells us that in October, 1834, he arre~ted
Maria Monk for stealing-" that on account of her
youth, and the respectability of her family," the man
from whom she stole declined prosecuting her-and
that he, taking pity on her, took her to a tavern, where
he kept her two or three days-and that a few days
afterwards, being sent for by her, he saw her again at
another tavern-and that the next time he saw her
was in September, 1835, when she, being in a house
of ill-fame, sent for him, and told him that .-she had
come to Montreal from New York, with Mr. Hoyt,
with whom she had left his (Malo's) child, at
Goodenough's tavern. It is in this way that this
contemptible creature, aided by the priests) wishes to

·t(lll the world that he is the father of Maria Monk's
child. Thus he glories in his own shame.
A full delineation of this man's character would
pollute even pollution itself. I must, therefore, be
excused from the loathsome task of even attempting it.
I will only say, that he is considered by all who know
him, as the greatest of blackguards, a perfect paragon
of im""lorality, a man destituttl of veracity, whose
oath, unsupported by others, even Mr. Jones himself
admitted in New York, was worthy of no confidence.
He owns some two or three houses in one of the
Montreal suburbs, all devoted to the goddess .of in-
famy, ~imself being the presiding genius over each
of them. What confidence, then, can possibly be
placed in this man's affidavit-an affidavit covering
some two or three pages of detail, all of which bear
the marks of sheer fabrication? Thus I will take my
leave of Louis Malo, with the simple remark, that
his affidavit appears to have been fabricated by the
priests or their agents, for the single purpose of find-
ing a father for Maria Monk's child, other than priest
Phelan, of Montreal, on whom she had sworn it.
Maria Monk professes to have eloped from the
Hotel Dieu nunnery in the early part of November,
1834. The priests say, that she left the service of
Mr. Lovis on the 7th or 8th of August, of the same
year. There is, therefore, some three months inter-
vening between the two points of time-from the time
she is said to have left Mr. Lovis' until the time she
professes to have escaped from the convent. Where
was she during these three months 1 The priests
t~ll us that " she took up her habitation in various

And is their testimony to be received against the per-

·we have thus traced their account of the different
places, in which they say Maria Monk resided from
the autumn of 1831, to November, 1834. And what
is the result 1 Is it not manifest, that all the state-

that the priests have given U! a true accoun1 'rMaria
Monk's residence during the time specified 1 Where
then was she during this time 1 · Before answering
this question, we must examine the statement of
Doctor Nelson. He says:-" That when I was the
medical attendant of the Hotel Dieu hospital, and
occasionally of the convent, which is the cloistered
part of the establishment, I never once saw Miss
Monk there; but more than once, at her mother's re-
quest, I saw her at the Government housekeeper's
apartments, which are those occupied by her mother;"
On page 184, Awful Disclosures, Maria Monk states ·
that she frequently at:ended Or. Nelson in his visits
to the public hospital, and wrote dowri his prescrip-
tions, &c. One or other of them, therefore, must be
mistaken, or a wilful deceiver. The doctor's state-
ment consists of two parts :-1. He denies having
seen her in the nunnery. This may be true, and yet ·
she may have been there, and he not have known her'io
her nun's apparel as being Miss Monk; though he·
must in that case have kno'.vn her as Saint Eustaee;

60 REPLY TO THE PRIESTS' BOOK.
2. He says that by her mother's request, he saw her
more than once at her mother's house. The question
is, when did he thus repeatedly see her at her mo·
ther's house 1 Was it during the time she professes
to have been in the nunnery 1 The doctor's declara-
tion is equivocal, and I fear designedly so. If he re-
peatedly saw her at her mother's request, at her resi·
dence, she must have been sick there. Now, if the doc-
tor's declaration, that he more than once saw her at her
mother's house, means any thing to the point, it means
that he saw her there during the time she professes to
have been a nun in the Hotel Dieu. But the priests
Jave professedly proved, that she lived during this
lime, in Sorel, St. Denis, Mr. Lovis', and in the Griffin
Town brothels. How could she have lived in these
places, and at the same time be sick at her mother's
house, under the care of Dr. Nelson 1 Let Dr. Nel·
son and the priests explain this, if th1 . can, for it is
more than I can comprehend. One thing, however,
is certain, viz. that Dr. Nelson's testimony either
proves no alibi from the nunnery, or else an alibi from
Sorel and St. Denis.
· However skilful Dr. Nelson may be as a physician,
his veracity appears to be, especially on this subject,
at a very low ebb. He is or has been physician to
the nuns. The priests call him a Protestant; but he
is not a Protestant, but a professed ridiculer of all re-
ligion. He keeps a mistress ; and, according to the
statement of Maria Monk, his conduct when in the
nunnery is very little better than that of the priesrs.

The testimony of Dr. Robertson and Mrs. Monk,
tdaria's mother, re-presented in the "Awful Expo-
sure," has been for a long time before the publie. It
amounts to little or nothiDg on the question, whether
or no Miss Monk has been an inmate in the nunnery.
Dr. Robertson expresses his opinion frofll hear say
testimony, that Maria Monk was in Sorel and St.
Denis, during a greater part of the time she profess-
es to have been in the nunnery. I suppose the priests
or their agents told him so. Mrs. Monk states that,
in conversation with certain gentlemen, she told them
t utt her daughter had never been in the nunnery.
The long affidavit of Mrs. Monk is a mere farce,
uever confirmed by her. Hence it has not her signa-
ture. It was fabricated under the direction of the
priests, who obtained a promise from her that she
would not contradict its statements. But if this were
not so, still we have the affidavit of Mr. William
Miller, who testifies that Mrs. Monk told him in the
summer of 1833, that her daughter Maria was then
in the nunH~ry: Awful Disclosures, page 237. The
reader may judge at which time she told the t!'ilth.
At the time she stated the fact to Mr. Miller, she was
under no temptation to tell an untruth. But not so
in August, 1835, when she says that she told certain
individuals, that her daughter had never been in the
nunnery. Besides, Mr. Jones expressly declared in
New York, in August, 1836, that the affidavit of
Mrs. Monk was now considered as injurious to their
cause, and that its first publication was regretted.
The affirmations of the Montreal tribe of Magda-
leos are beneath contempt. They affirm that, in the
_
winter of .1834-5, Maria Monk told them of her resi-
4ing in SQrel, St. Denis, &c., but never intimated to

them nnr thing respecting her having been a nun in
the Hotel Dieu. Admitting all they say on thi'!J sub-
ject were tr!Je, however, it would amount simply to
this, that Miss Monk, for the sake of her own safety,
practised deception upon them as to the fact of her
having eloped from the convent. But who has any
confidence in this fictitious tribe of Magdalens 1 Well
did Mr. Jones, publisher of the "Awful Exposure,"
sny to me in New York, that many of hilt witnesses
could not be found, and that I should need his assist-
ance to find them. Some of these Magdalens have
been searched for, but lo, they were not to be found !
Respecting thia manrnuvre of the priests, I shall hne
occasion to remark more at length hereafter. Suffice
it to'say, that the priests could never have expected to
gull anybody with this Magdalen trick, except it
were such as " love darkness rather than light."
These Magdalens and Louis Malo are at direct antip-
odes in their affidavits. They affirm that he had in-
tercourse with Maria Monk, during the winter of
1834-5, in the yard·of the Asylum. He affirms that
he never heard of her from October, 1834, until Sept.
1835.
This completes our review of the documentary tes-
timony presented by the priests, to prove an alibi in
the case of Maria Monk-that she resided elsewhere
than in the nunnery, during the time she professes to
have been a nun in that establishment. What then

ne~s, unless it be the notoriously profligate ·Mary An-
gelica Monk-the intimate friend of Kelly, the most
licentious priest there is in Canada. Not a single un-
exceptionable witness is to be found among them.
I wish my readers to remember, how easy a matter
it is to prove an alibi in Maria Monk's case, provided
she has never been a nun in the Hotel Dieu. If she
lived about one yP.ar in Sorel, and about one year and
a half in St. Denis, as maintained by the priests, how
easy a matter it would have been to prov6 ,(, br un-
exceptionable witnesses 1 If true, why present to us
as witnesses, such unprincipled characters as Martel
Pau~ Charles Gouin, Angelica Monk, &c.7 The
very fact, that the priests have been unable to furnish
any better testimony, after the labor of so may months,
is in itself evidence of the desperateness o~ their un-
dertaking. I beg of my readers to ponder well this
particular roint, for it is of gn•at importance ia the
controversy. 'Vhen I take into consideration aU the
circumstances of the case-the length of time which
the priests have had to collect evidence-the fact
that Maria Monk is said to have lived for two years
and a half in the two plac('s specified-the fact that
the mass of the people in these two towns are favora-
ble to the priests, and of course, decidedly hostile to
Miss Monk's claims---and above all, when I consider
its immense importance to the priests; that upon it
is suspentted the strength of their defence; and then
look at the testimony adduced-! feel constrained to
say that, in my judgment, the priests and their
agents ha·ve utterly failed in their attempt to prove
an alibi.

Stone's Report the result o>f a mere hoax-Resolutions of August,
1836, passed in New York.
FROM the time of her visit to Montreal, in August,
1835, Maria Monk, in confirmation of the fact that
she had been an inmate of the Hotel Dieu, appealed
to an impartial examination of that convent-staking
the truth of her claims to public confidence on the
result of such an examination. She thus challenged
her ovponents to test the matter by a fair tribunal.
This challenge the friends of the priests pretend to
say, has been accepted, because on the fifteenth day
of July, 1836, they subjected the nunnery to the ex-
amination of a few individuals, as a committee, ap-
pointed by themselves for that purpose. But before
receiving the report of this committee, as deci~ing
6*
I,
66 REPLY TO THE PRIES'rs' EOOlt.·
the point in controversy, several things should be dis·
tmctly noticed.
1. The time which elapsed from the period sh~;;
l~ft the convent, until the day the examination was
made. She professes to have eloped from the nun-
nery in the early part of November, 1834, and the
examination took place in July, 1836. T hus about
one year and eight months intervened between the
points of time. A period of time more than sufficient
to have rebuilt the nunnery, if they had been so dis-
pned. .
2. She first made her appeal to this test in the Au-
gust of 1835; so that eleven months intervened, be-
fore the pretended examination of it was made. .
3. It was announced in the public prints in Octo-
ber, 1835, that men were employed in making altera~
tions in the Hotel Dieu; so that this announcement,
uncontrr.dicted, was before the public c.~out nine
months, prior to the examination. On page 6"3, of
her book, which was published in the following Janu-
ary, Miss Monk makes the same charge in these
word!! :-"And I have been credibly informed, that
masons have been employed in the nunnery since I
left it." Such assurances she had while in Montreal,
as well as since her return to New York.
So much in reference to time for making altera-
tions. The next thing worthy of notice, is the ap·
pointment and character of the committee, who made
the examination. In the appointment of this com-
mittee, neithe! Maria Monk, nor her friends, had any
voice whatever. It was chosen exclusively by her
avowed enemies. Mr. Jones, the agent of the priests,
and publisher of the "Awful Exposure," declared, in
New York, again ancl again, that he selected and in-

Yited the individuals composing it. It was, therefore,
altogether an exparte committee.
As to the·qualifications of these judges in the case,
were it consistent with the demands of truth and
justice, I would gladly pass them over in tnute si·
Jence. But fidelity to the task I have undertaken,
peremptorily forbids it, however unpleasant it may
be. The public stand which these gentlemen have.
taken, and the tremendous responsibility which they
have voluntarily assumed, in taking upon themselves·
the office of judges in the case, and publishing their
verdict to the world, authorizes every man to examine
their qualifications, as well as their right, thus to act.·
I remark, then, that one and all of them have, from
the commencement of the controverl'y, been the de-
cided opponents of Maria Monk. Mr. Jones, the os-
tensible leader in all the movements which have bee!l
made to vindicate the criminated priests-avows him-
self to be a Roman Catholic, though he is understood
to be, by those who know him, ,an infidel-a man in
whose word, little or no confidence can be placed.
He det:lared in New York, iu the presence of several
gentlemen, that he published the first article that was
ever published against Maria Monk in Canada, be-
fore hP. ever saw either her or her book: and then on
another occasion, when he was shown that. that very
article was in direct opposition to the whole tenor of
his book, he denied that he ever had published it.
Mr. Holmes is a decided opponent of Miss Monk.
The Re':. Mr. Esson is a Scotch clergyman; a man
whose character has labored exceedingly for several
years past. His name is quite con1<picuous in the
nricus documents which have been issued, from tim~
to time in Montreal, against Maria Monk. Of .'the
I
UEPLY ~~ TilE PRIESTS' BOQJt,
genetal characters of the Rev. Messrs. Perkins and
Curry, I have nothing to say, but what is praJsewor-
th) ,f them. As ministers of Christ, they have the
gene1.1l confidence of the Christian community. But,
unfortunately, both for themselves and the cause of
tru~h, they have been led to pursue a course, in ~efer­
cnce to the controversy between Miss Monk and the
pri~sts, which appears to me, every enlightened and
unprejudiced man must unhesitatingly condemn. It
is known, that, from the first, they have, in their let-
ters, and in their conversation, been active ·in oppo-
sing the claims of Maria Monk. Being early prejudiced
~gainst her, they took a decided stand in their oppo-
sition,; and thus becoming partisans, they have been
goaded on from step to step in vindication \)i' their
own conduct. I speak advisedly on this subject, and
with no other feelings, than those of kindness to-
wards these gentlemen.
The origin and growth of their prejudice can be
easily traced. Miss Monk ~ent in company with
Mr. Hoyt, from New York to Montreal, to procure a
legal investigation of her charges against the priests.
An unhappy difference existed between Mr. Perkins
and Mr. Hoyt, who had been residing for some time
previous in and about Montreal, as an agent for some
benevolent societies. This fact, connected with the
circumstance that Mr. Hoyt was ~ member of the
Free Presbyterian church of that city, and was espe-

fallen into other hands, it is probable Mr. Perkins
would never have occupied the unnatural position in
which he now presents himself, to the astonishment
of the Protestant public. His position is not the re-
sult of any friendship which he feels towards priests,
nuns, and their religion. Popery in all its forms he
abominates.
It was evident from an early date, to those who
were investigating Miss Monk's case, in New York,
·that he was under strong excitement : for he replied
only in terms of passion to a respectfullt>tter address-
ed to him, for information on the 3Ubject. .
Mr. Curry, having then but recently arrived in
· Canada, and being intimately associated with Mr.
Perkins, was, amidst the generql unpopularity ·ot
Miss Monk's cause, easily led to array himself against
her claims ; and the sarcastic tone of his letter sta-
ting the results of his examination of the Conv.ent
exhibits the violence of his prejudice. · ·He has since
been serving the cause of the priests, however much
he may dislike their religion. The first intimation!
received in New York, respecting Maria Monk's hav-
ing described the Montreal Magdalen Asylum, in-
stead of the Hotel Dieu nunnery-a fiction of recent
·date-were connected with his movements. He was
represented as searching the building, and applying
·the test; and Mr. Jones, in the presence of the Edi-
tors of the New York Sun, declared to the writer of
·this, on his (Mr. C.'s) authority, that he (Mr. C.)
found Maria Monk's plan to be an exact fac-simile of
the interior of that Asylum ! !
Such, then, were the qualifications of the examining
eomiDittee. And that I have not misjudged in the
matter, I feel quite confident) tRpecially in rei'erence

BOOK,
tt. the Rev. Mr. Perkins,-whose opinion is perhaps
considered to be the most important of any in the
committee-for I have several letters from him, which
abundantly evince the imbittered state of his feelings
on this subject.*
One word respecting the time occupied in examin-
ing the nunnery. The building is a huge affair. Ac-
cording to Bouchette's Topographical Description of
Lower Canada, it is 324 feet in front, on St. Paul
street, by 468 feet in depth, on St. Joseph street. Now
Mr. Jones declared in Nr!w York that the committee
were occupied only between two and three hours in
making their examination, "from garret to ceJlar."
This being the case, it is impossible that the examina-
tion could have been any thing like a thorough one.
Such being the circumstances of the case, it may
be asked, what but an unfavorable report could be
expected, by the friends of Miss Monk, from such
·~ committee 1 But let us examine the report itself,
and see what it amounts to. It is professedly written
by the Rev. Mr. Curry, and sanctioned by the remain-
der ofthe committee.

tence; s~ys Mr. Curry,." I did a few weeks since, in

report of the committee, he says :-
But the community who know the facts of the case will not
be satisfied with such an examination; for all the five gentle-

company with N. B. Doucet and J.P. Lacroix, Esqs.,
and without sending any previous notice, visit said
nunnery," &c. He goes on to state that he examined
every thing "from the cellar to the roof," out-houses
and all, except the cloistered department ; and that
the lady Superior and the nuns, to whom he was in-
troduced, offered him every facility ; and that he was
assured by one ofthem "that ifthey had had timely no-
tice of his visit, a permit from the bishop would have
been obtained to give him immediate access to the
whole of the cloistered department." Now the im-
pression that all this is adapted to make is, that Mr~
Curry's visit was unexpected to the nuns, and that
they and their lady Superior earnestly courted an ex-
amination of their convent. But be it known that
N. B. Doucet and J.P. Lacroix, Esquires, Mr. Curry's
associates in his adventure, are Roman Catholics,
and great friends of the prie·sts; and Maria Monk de-
clares that they are habitual visiters of the Hotel
Dieu, for the same purpose that the priests visit that'
house of ill-fame. Hence the probability is, that the
priests, nuns, and their two comrades, liad the matter·
all "cut and dried," in order that they might make
the·'e:tperiment, and see how far they could mislead
Mr. Curry ; and thus judge whether they might pru-
dently admit a committee, in part under his general-
ship, to explore the nunnery. It appears that the ex-
periment succeeded just as they would have it. In
this exploration, Mr. Cumr found nothing that bore
any resemblance, as he tells us, to Maria Monk's de-
scriptions. This may be called the first part or' the·
examination-a sort of preparation for the work of thi
iuture committee.
Some time after this the committee was organizei:l~·
,_.
72 REPLY '1'0 THE PRI£81':!: BOOk.
and the examination made. The result was the same
as before with Mr. Curry ; the committee " were
nnable to discover the remotest resemblance between
any part of said building, and the plan or description.
of Maria Monk." Maria's name was not to be found,
either in "the register of deaths," or in "the register
in which are entered the names, ages, and dates of
the taking the veil of each nun." No trace of her
was to be foun.J; not even the names of those men-
tioned in her disclosures.
This report of the committee is all negatives. The
~mmittee tell us that they repeatedly traversed every
section of the nunnery," and could find nothing re-
sembling Maria Monk's descriptions. But they do
not'tell us what they did find ; whether a greater or
less number of rooms, thr..n she mentions in her de-
scriptions. We are thus left to grope our way in all
the darkness of negatives•
. In a letter from the Rev. Mr. P1•rkins, written im·
mediately after the examination took place, he in-
forms the writer of these pages, that Maria " has pla-
ced the cloistered part of the establishment where the
kitchen is : and that the whole concem is turned up·
side down." It appears from this statement, and
from a conversation which I had with Mr. Jones,
eonfirmed by the testimony of Mr. Ostell, that the
eloistered part of the Hotel Dieu nunnery, is not, at
present, the rear central wing of that building, as de-
scribed by Maria Monk. The truth is, that amidst
the changes and alterations which have taken place
in that convent, since she left it, the nuns' depart-
ment has been changed from the rear middle wing, to
another part ofthe building. That they formerly oc-

Monk, is a (act that the priests dare not deny. It is
a fact that can be proved by several witnesses, now
residing in New York. Hence " the whole concern,' ·
a~ Mr. Perkins says, "is turned upside down" from
what she described it. And well it should Le, for she
does not, in her published writings, attempt to de-
scribe the present habitation of the nuns.
From Mr. Jones, I learned that that part of the
building described by Miss Monk, is now occupied a'
a kitchen, sleeping-rooms for servants, storage-rooms,
a place for old rubbish, &c. &c. How easy, then, to
mislead and bewilder such a committee, hastening
through the nunnery as they must have done, seeing
they despatched their search in so short a time !-
Since the report of the committee, some of Miss
Monk's friends have attempted to examine this part
of the building, and have been peremptorily excluded.
Why is this 1 My readers can easily conjecture.
Before leaving this exparte report of the commit·
tee, two things mentioned in it, deserve a passing
notice. First, speaking of the register of names, Mr.
Curry says: " To ascertain whether this was the real
register, I called for the name of a nun with whom I
had become acquainted about one year since, and was
immediately referred to it. In this record, which. was
an old book, there were no erasures, no mutilations.
We searched for the name of Maria Monk, and others
mentioned in her boqk; no such names were there."
Now this looks like a'piece of accomplished Jesuitism
on the part of the priests and nuns. Who knows but
this book may have been prepared with said names,
for the express purpose of deception1 Mr. Curry has
said, in conversation, that he was expressly request•
eel by the mother of said nun to make inquiries re-
7
UEP I.Y 'l'O 'I'll£ I':U t:::T.:;' t OO K.
specting her daughter. It was therefore known before-
hand that Mr. Gurry would inquire for her. Or, per-
~aps, it is an old register of a<lmissions, but false or
~mperfect. But to settle the question beyond dispute,
let the bishop and the Superior present it to the pub-
iic; and let its names be transcribed; and let inquiry
~e made, and·see if it contains the name of every in-
dividual who has been known to enter that convent.
No one can raise an objection to this course.
' The other thing to be noticed is the statement, that
Maria Monk in passing from the nunnery through the
yard into the street, according to the course which she
says she took-" must have passed directly over, under,
:Or through, at least, three high stone walls." This
may ;he true, as things now exist in that yard. But it
is known that alterations have been made in that yard.
·By referring to the ground plan of the drawing in her
book, which was taken in the autumn of 1835, by a
~competent gentleman in Montreal, it will be seen
that no walls then existed in the course she describes
herself to have taken, until she arrived to the one on
Jean Bapti::.te street, in which she says there was a
:small gate, opening on the inside, through which she
:passed into the street. I have been credibly inform-
'ed that such a gate formerly existed in that wall.*
·BL•t be that as it may, it ig matter of little conse-
,quence. She may be mistaken in this particular;
,and may have passed into Jean Baptiste street,
through the gate leading out of the yard of the Con-

gregational Nunnery, or in some othcr ·wl,\y. -It wa~
dark, and she had just left the nunnery, and was,
doubtless, much terrified and bewildered, hardly
knowing what course she did take. She knew that
she had just violated the awful oaths by which she
had been bound to the convent, and that she was
fearfully exposing herself to be taken and cruelly
punished, if not absolutely murdered, as her saintly
sister St. Francis had been. This being the case,
the committee ought to be ashamed of their unfeeling
and contemptuous statement, that "she must have
passed directly over, under, or through at least three
high stone walls that would have discouraged a less
adventurous .lady." .
Appended to the report of the examining commit:-
tee, we have a statement from Mr. John Ostell, ar;
chitect and surveyo;:, giving us the result of a pr~
fessional application of Maria Monk's plan or draw:
ing, to that part of the Hotel Dieu professedly de-
scribed by her-the centre wing. He " declares i~ tp
ba his opinion, that, architecturally speaking, ·an~
with reference to the practice prevailing in Canada,
in the construction of buildings, it is impossible that
the said plan should have any real existence," in co~,­
nexion with that part of the nunnery. Mr. Ostel~
assigns three reasons for his opinion.. The presen.t
cloistered apartments, he informs us, "he was ~ot
permitted to enter.." .)
One of the three reasons mentioned by Mr. Oste~~
has nothing to do with the subject. It is a disc~­
pancy between Maria Monk's drawing of the inte;
rior, and the ground or block plan, of the building,
drawn by .another person. Miss Monk distinctlJ
states in her book, "that the general plan of the
'76 REPLY TO YH£ I'RIESTS1
BOOK.
grounds and buildings, were in some respects dcfcc·
dve and erroneous," and that she was not responsi·
ble for its errors. It was drawn by a gentleman in
Montreal, who was fnlly competent to do it correctly,
and who would bnvc lloi:L' it so, had he not been
driven unceremoniously out of the yard. Sec Awful
Disclosures, p. 374. Why Mr. Ostcll should men·
lion, as a rt!nson for his opinion, n discrepancy, which
exists between her drawing of the interior, and a
drawing of the exterior, of the nunnery, by nno!her
person, I am unable to understand.
Another reason assigned, is m the following
words:-" Thnt the partition wa1ls on the first and
second stories, have no correspondence with each
other, commencing and ending on each separate
!tory ; whereas it is nece!lsary that such walls should
not only correspond with each other, but that they
should commence in the cellar." According to what
is said here, by Mr. O!ltell, Canadian houses must be
very singular in their construction-each story, from
the cellar upwards, must have an equal number of ·
rooms, of equal size. For example, if there be five
rooms on the first floor, there must be five, of pre-
cisely the same dimensions, on the second floor, and
also in the cellar. If there be a bed-room in the
third story, of a three story house, there must be a
bed-room in each story beneath, even down into the
cellar. If this be so, all I have to say is, that the
mode of constructing houses in Canada, is a very
absmd mode. There is no doubt, however, but what
mr.ny of the walls are one and the same, beginning
in the ce1lar, and pa~sing through each story in the
house; but to say that this is the case with e!'ch
j'artition wall, is evidently incorrect.

'l'lte temnining reason is, that-" The second story
plnn showtc a portion of huilding nt one extremity,
without nny similar suh~tructure in the lower sto·
ries." This ts true, and w.ts spoken of by myHelf
and the gentleman who assisterl Miss Monk in Ut'·
rauging her drawing for the engraver. It was uis·
tinctly pomtcd out to her, but !~he was unable to rc-
riwve the difficulty. All she knew was, that on the
second story, there were such and such rooms, thu.,;
and thus located, containing such anti s1wh furniture,
and devoted to such and such usc:ol. S he showed
nouc of that ready wit and expedient, which her
enemies so liberally attribute to her; nor did she evl'n
attempt to reconcile tht:' discrepancy pointed out to
her. She exhibited the artlessness of a child in the
matter.
It is proper here to say a word or two, respecting
the origin of Miss Monk's drawing of the interior of
the Hotel Dicu, or that part of it form erly occupied
by the cloistered nuns. At the time it was done, ~;h e
had been out of the nunnery some fifteen or sixteen
months-months of excitement and varied trials and
sufferings, such as few females of her age arc ever
called upon, in the providence of God, to endure. It
was madt> solely from memory, and in cor.sidcrahle
haste; for the idea of drawing an entire plan of the
department was not suggested, until the edition, iu
which it was to be inserted, was nearly ready for the
press, although several sketches of different parts had
been previ.ougly drawn. The building described, is
a huge establishment; containing many rooms, and
of cour~e, a description of them, solely from recollec-
tion, wa<> attended with much perplexing difficulty.
T '1is will he readily seen by every reflecting.mind ; and

if any man doubts it, let him remove his doubts, by at·
tempting to give a drawing from memory, even of the
house in which he was born and raised. Under these
circumstances, nothing but an imperfect and general
description, could possibly have been expected. The
demand, that she should have given to each room its
exact proportionate size, so as to have the separating
walls on each story exactly correspond with each
other, is beyond measure unreasonable. No man on
earth could do it, except he were on the spot, with
his measuring rule in his hand. How preposterous,
then, to require it of a girl in her situation I
The two discrepancies between her drawing and
the building, pointed out by Mr. Ostell, were known
to exist before her plan was published. It was known
that the walls between the rooms on each story, did
not correspond with each other ; nor was such a cor
respondence even sought for, much less professed.
It was also known that a portion of the second story
extended beyond the first story, so as to be without
any corresponding substructure. Miss Monk knew
it ; and had she been an impostor, and of course her
drawing a mere fancy work, her fancy would have
created a room or two more for the first story, and
thus have removed the want of the substructure spo-
ken of. This is a ~trong evidence of her honesty.
Or had we who a~:;isted her in arranging it, been so
disposed, we could have done it; but that would have
been contrary to our determination from the first,
which was, thaL every thing ascribed to Miss Monk,
in her book, should be her own production, and not
ours. As we sought nothing but truth, it was our
determination, that she should ~tand or fall by her
own descriptions.

And now, understanding the subject, as I do, I so·
lemnly aver, that the architectural r~port of Mr. Os-
tell presents to my mind, irresiuti ~lc e1· Jdence of the
fact, that Maria Monk has dt>~.c.ribt:r1
, Lhough \mper-
f~ctly, the centre wing or main .,, ;j,: :ng of the Hotel
Dieu,Jrom a personal kno1o!~:dg..·, it, obtained by
a long residence in that establ.\.-;hmP-nt. Her de·
scription of it appears, from this r"port, to be quite
as accurate R!l I ever !!Upposed it to be. In speaking
of a portion of :he first story, on page 396 of her
book, Miss Monk says:-" Of the size anil precise
number of the two or three succeeding rooms, I am not
very certain. I think I have drawn them pretty nearly
right." Now, suppose-what is probably the truth in
the case-that, in the indistinctne~s of her recollec-
tion alluded to in this passage, she has omitted in her
drawing, a single room; would not the omission ac-
count for the discrepancies spoken of by Mr. Ostel11
Would it not represent the first story of that long
building, as being shorter than the second, and thus
produce the absence of the substructure spoken of1
And would it not produce the want of a general cor-
respondence in the separating walls, on the two sto-
ries of the building1
I beg of the reader to pause and consiJer this pro-
fMsional report of Mr. Ostell, for a single moment.
Maria Monk, in the first place, gave us a general de-
scription of the first story of the nunnery-her former
abode ; and then of the second story. We compared
the two together, to see if they corresponded with
each other ; and we saw that they did not. ·we saw
tl_lat she had made the second story somewhat long·
t'!' than the first, and of course that there was a want
of ageneral correspondence in the walls, separating
80 REPLY TO THE PRIESTS1
ROOK.
the roQDls in each story. We stated the fact to her,
and she made another e!l'ort, but came to the same re-
sult, saying, "I have done a!:! well as I could, and if
there are mistakes, I can't help i t.'~ We saw that she
was confused in her recollections, respecting a por-
tion of the first story-where the rooms are number-
ed, the 4th, 5th and 6th. This imperfection of mem-
ory is alluded to in the above extract from her book.
Bu! notwithstanding this known imperfection in her
drawing, we published it; and what is the result 1
An architect is employed, some time afterwards, ~y
her opponents, to compare the drawing with the
buihling ; and he reports unfavorably, a~signing as
his reasons, the very imperfections which we knew
exi~'t:!d before the drawing W:lR published. I ask,
th~n, what stronger evidence could be presented to
our minds, than ts here offered by Mr. Ostell, of the
fact, that her drawing is not the work of fancy, but
of sober reality 1 If Mr. Ostell had found any other
discrepancies than these two, between her drawing
and the building, he unquestionably would have
named them, in place of mentioning the one first no-
ticed above, which has nothing to do with the sub-
j€:ct-the discrepancy between her drawing of the
interior, and the plan of the exterior, of the building,
furnished by another persGn. He d0cs not intimate
any incorrectness as to the general form and size of
the building, as descr:. bed in her drawing.
If any man will take into consic~:.:ration the entire
circumstances of the case-her youth and inexperi-
ence in such matterz-the undisciplined state of her
mind--the size of the building, and consequent diffi-
culty attending its description-the agitations, trials,
and sufferings she had experienced-the long time

~hich had elapsed sioce her elopement from the nun-
nery ; he must see, in the light of Mr. Ostell's report,
that the drawing of Miss Monk is as accurate as could
have been reasonably expecteu. He must and will
see the intrinsic absurdity of the idea, that she drew
her p!an of the interior of the nunnery from the mere
workings of a wild, undisciplined ~magination. The
man that can understandingly beli·
:Jve, that her draw-
ing is mere fancy work, can believe any thing, how-
ever absurd. His belief is beyond the point of being
infiuenced by evidence ; and of course it were an ab-
surdity to attempt to reason with him on the subject.
What then is the conclusion 1 Have not the priests
failed in this attempt to mislead the public 1 Is not
their attempt here as fruitless, as that in the preceding
chapter to prove an alibi 1 Nay, this attempt is more
than a failure. It furnishes evidence of a high degree
in support of Miss Monk's claims.
In connexion with Mr. Ostell's report, how reck-
less does the following declaration of Mr. Curry,
sanctioned by the other members of the committee, ap-
pear!-" In conclusion, I declare, to all whom it may
concern, that if Maria Monk has told the truth in her
description of the interior of the Hotel Dieu nunnery
of Montreal, I shall not be slow to klieve that th~
nuns of Canada yet retain the power of working mira-
cles with stone and mortar."* No miracle need to
have been wrought, nor a particle of stone or mortar
used, and yet it is extremely manifest from Mr. Os-
tell's professional report, that her description of the
interior of the nunnery has its foundation in truth.

But then there can be no doubt but what extensive
alterations have been made in that convent, since
Maria Monk left it ; and the priests, in any responsi-
ble manner, dare not deny it.* Mr. Curry knows
that alterations have been made; for he has declared,
as I have bet:n crt::dibly informed, that he saw a hole,
or well, newly dug, in the cellar ofthat establishment;
and when asked why he did not mention it in his
report, he replied, that he did not feel himself called
upon to state what he saw in the nunnery !" True,
if he wished faithfully to serve the priesthood of Mon-
treal, he was not called upon to report any thing un-
favorable to their interests. Alas, for such a commit-
tee! What motive could have influenced them to
take upon themselves the performance of a task,
for which they must have known themselves to be so
incompetent 1 They knew, as well as they knew they
existed, that they were among the bitterest of Miss
Monk's opponents; and they also must have known
*The Rev. Mr. Clary of Montreal, published in August, 1836,
to the world, over his own eignaturc, the following statement,
which, so far as I know, remains unconiradicted by any respon-
sible person in Montrsal. "Material alterations hat•e been
made in and around the Con-vent!1! Those persons living
where they can look over the wall into the enclosure of the
convent, say, that cartmen and masons have been at work

Again in October 17th, 183fi, speaking
of Mr. Stone'&report, he says:-" He said nothing about the
recent building and repairing of stone walls within the enclo-
sure of the convent, and which everybody who wishes can
see, nor the new wall within the building, as mentioned privately

the fact, that they were thus consideret1 by all who
were interested in ferreting out the truth of her awful
charges against that nunnery. Could they then for a
single moment have supposed, that an unfavorable
report from them would terminate the controversy?
And they must have known, that the priests would nev-
el have selected them for the task, unless they hadfelt
quite sure of obtaining such a report from them.
What object, then, could they hope to gain by serving
on such a committee 1 It is to he hoped, that Messrs.
Perkins and Curry-as to the rest of the committee,
it is of little consequence what ranks they occupy-
will hereafter leave the priests and nuns to defend
their own unnatural and impure institutions. They
are in bad company, and in had business.
Before leaving this subject, I wish briefly to notice
the senseless fiction, that Maria Monk has described
the interior of the Magdalen Asylum of Montreal,
instead of the interior of the Hotel Dieu nunnery. I
call this a senseles3 fiction, recently fabricated for the
purpose ofdeception. Mrs. McDonell, matron of the
Asylum, states on oath, "that the description given
in the said 'Disclosures,' of the interior of the Hotel
Dieu, is an incorrect description of the apartments of
the said Asylum." Here is a fair specimen ofjesuitism,
found in the phrase "incorrect description." What
does Mrs. McDonell mean by it 1 Does she mean to
say that Maria Monk attemptfd to describe the Asy-
lum, and has done it incorrectly ? r.~· does she mean,
that Maria Monk's attempted d·c.:.;cr.iption of the Hotel
Dieu, incorrectly resem hl.~s the Asylum 1 I am una-
·hie to conceive of a••y ~;ther rr.e;.ming which may h2
-attached to it. To sr. y titat .~!aria Monk attempted
'to give a description of her Asylum, is a declaration
84 REPLY TO TU£ PRIESTS' DOOJ:,
so absurd as not to be within the limits or reason or
common sense. It cannot therefore be reasoned about.
And to affirm that Miss Monk's descriptions bear an
incorrect resemblance to her Asylum, i::l about as rele-
vant as it would be to affirm, that they bore an incor--
rect resemblance to the moun ; for both the moon and
Mrs. McDonell's Asylum have the dimensions of
length, breadth, height, and depth, and so has Maria
Monk's drawing; and in this respect there is an
incorrect resemblance between all of them.
The truth is, this "exemplary and charitable"
woman is unworthy of the least confidence. She has
perjured herself in several instances in her affidavit.
She affirms that Maria Monk had led the life of a
stroller and a prostitute, for many years, in direct
opposition to all the priests' witnesses, who affirD'l
that she had been living during this time in Sorel and
St. Denis- in the latter as a school mistress, for
some fifteen months, while Dr. Nelson says she was
a part of the time with her mother. She also affirms
that Louis Malo was in the habit of visiting Maria
Monk during the winter of 1834-5, whilst he affirms
that he never heard of her during this period. She is
a mere tool of the priests, ready to swear to any thing
which they command her. R especting this tri<~k or
the priests, I have more to say hereafter.
I will conclude this chapter with the subjoined ex-
pressive resolutions, simply observing that the com•
mittet> therein named to explore the convent, in
company with Maria Monk, have as yet received no
permi~;sion from the proper authorities, to discharge
the duty assigned thelfl. Why is this 1 If Maria

the public will hereafter duly appreciate the reports
of l'Xparte and superficial examiners of the nunnery,
such a~ the one already examined ; and also that
recently published in New York by Mr. William L.
Stone, who, according to his own narrative, appears
not to have seen a single room in that part of the
convent professedly described by Maria Monk. He
appears to have been completely duped by the priests
and nuns; and of course, his report is a sheer imposi-
tion on the public, and should be treated as such.
RESOLUTIONS.
RESPECTING MARU MONK .
" At a meeting convened in the American Tract
Jociety's Rooms, at the call of several gentlemen,
for the purpose of considering the controversy existing
between Maria Monk and the Romish Priests of the
Montreal Diocess, Francis D. Allen, Esq. was called
to the chair, and the R ev. Octavius Winslow ap-

1836 ;-I have tried to get permission for a Committee of gen-
tlemen j1·om New York, with others j 1·om this place, to go in,
and take Maria Monk with them, but I ha~e not succeeded. In
his letter of October the 17th, he says :-on the same da:,r of
the examination of the convent, made in July last, under the
guidance of Mr. Jones, the C11tholic editor of this city, ! made
upplication to him for permission for a few gentlemen from
New York, with others from this city, under the guidance of
Maria Monk, to examine the convent, whose report I deemed
the only one which would bring out the truth or satisfy the
community. He seemed in favor of this proposal on the con-
dition that if they failed t.o prove the troth of tha Disclosures,

pointed as Secretary. The following Preamble and
Resolutions were unanimously adopted :
" Whereas, Maria Monk has hitherto appealed in
vain to the Canadian authorities, both civil and eccle-
siastical, to bring her charges against the Romish
priests of the Montreal Diocess, to some equitable
tribunal for investigation; and, whereas, she now ap-
peals to the people of the United States, invoking
them to interpose in her behalf, and demand that jus-
tict': be rendered to her, a lonely girl, in her peculiarly
trying and unequal controversy with the priests of the
Romish church; and, whereas, the people of the
United States-besides being always disposed to lis-
'
ten to the voice of the friendless and the persecuted-
have a deep and solemn interest in the matter in dis-
pute, in consequence of the rapid increase of Popery
and of popish institutions in their country ; and also,
in consequence of the contiguity of the Canadian
nunneries, and their intimate connexion with, and
influence upon, the rising institutions of America:-
Therefore.
"Resol·ved, 1st, That it is the sense of this meeting
that the appeal vf Maria Monk to the American peo-
ple, ought to be prompily and efficiently responded to,
so far as the nature of the case will admit 01~
"Resolved, 2d, That the conduct of the Romish
Montreal priests and their advocates-(1) in attempt-
mg, by every means, to asperse and vilify the charac-
ter of Maria Monk; and (2) in attempting, through
the most artful deceptions, to O.:'coy her into their
hands; ·and (3) in refusing, for the space of one full
·.:year,,td allow the matter in controversy to be brought
· tch~:, fair .trial; bespeaks any thing rather than manly
honesty and virtuou~ innocence.

"Resolved, 3d, That the recent examination, said
to have been made, of the Hotel Dieu nunnery of
Montreal, is altogether unsatisfactory ; because ( 1)
the gentlemen engaged in it have been, from the be-
ginning, strongly and actively prejudiced against
Maria Monk. Mr. Jones, editor of a Romish paper,
under the am~pices of the priests, and principal mover
in getting up the book against Maria Monk, which is
about to appear, containing, among other things, the
results of this party examination, was their leader.
And because (2) material alterations are said to
'have been made in and around the convent dur1:ng
the past year-alterations, such as doubtless would
easily deceive such a committee of examiners. Fo.r
these reasons, any report unfavorable to Maria Monk,
made by these disqualified examiners, ought to have
no influence in deciding this controversy.
"Resolved, 4th, That the recent effort of the priests
and their defenders, to make it appear that Maria
Monk, instead of describing the Hotel Dieu nunnery
and. its inmates, has described a place which they
call a "Magdalen Asylum;"· and also, their attempts
to prove, by the affidavits of some unprincipled prof-
ligates and infidels, calling themselves protestants,
and of ignorant papists, that she never was a nun;
but that she has been of a bad charaeter, living in
brothels, &c., is highly characteristic of Jesuitism;
adapied t"o blind and bewilder the public mind, and
tum it' away from the single point to which it ought
to be directed, viz: an impartial examination ofthe
~Mffi~ .
"Resolved, 5th: That the demand made and reitera.:.
ted by Maria Monk, during the space of a full year,
viz : thnt herself in person, accompanied by her

friends, as well as enemies, should be permitted to
exp!ore the nunnery, is perfectly reasonable and
right; and that a further refusal: in the present state
of the case, forthwith to comply with it, on the part
of the Hotel Dieu Ecclesiastics, ought to be consid-
tred as equivalent tn an acknowledgment of lite
crimes alleged against thP.m by Maria Monk.
"Resolved, 6th, That a committee of four gentlemen
be now aJlpointed, with power to fill vacancies and
increase their number, either in the United State!' or
in Canada, to accompany Maria Monk to Montreal,
so soon as the authorities of Canada shall afford suit-
able protection to such a committee, and shall grant
them the necessary permission and facilities for tho-
roughly exploring the Hotel Dieu nunnery, and such
other establishment~ as are said to be connected with
it, viz., the Priest's Seminary, and the Congregational
Nunnery, connected by subterranean passages ; and
also the Black Nuns' Island, which seems to be a
component part of the Hotel Dieu nunnery of Mon-
treal ; and that the following gentlemen be appointed
on that committee,-George Hall, Esq., late Mayor of
Brooklyn, ProfessorS. F. B. Morse, David Wessen.
Esq., and Rev. J. J. Slocum.

induced to believe that Maria MJ.mk is not the sole
authoress of the disclosures attrib11ted to her. She is
yet in her youth, and according to the position assum-
ed and proved by them, as they say, she has hitherto
led the life of an infamous stroller, being subject to
fits of insanity from her childhood, and has never
been a Roman Catholic. Taking this ground, they
readily perceive that it will not do to admit that she,
and she alone, has furnished the matter of her disclo-
sures; for they know that all the world will see that
the thing is impossible in the nature of the case.
Yea, they know that it will not do, on any considera-
tion whatever, to admit that she is the sole authoress
of her works. The admission would ruin them ; for
it is utterly impossible that she should have produced
'the matter of her narrative, unless she had been an
inmate of the Hotel Dieu nunnery of Montreal. Thi&

\hey know full well. Hence the various and contra..
dietary sources, which they have alleged to be the
true origin of her disclosureR.-Let us notice some
two or three of these.
Immediately after the "Awful Disclosures" were
published, the Boston Pilot (a Catholic paper) issued
.the following statement, as disclosing their true ori-
gin:-
" We are ready and willing to declare upon oath,
that the extracts which we have seen in the New
York Transcript, Boston Morning Post, Salem Ga-
zette, and other respectable periodicals, purporting to
be extracts from the disclosures of Maria Monk, &c.,
are to be found, word for word, and letter for letter,
(proper names only being altered,) in a book transla-
ted from the Spanish or Portuguese language, in 1781,
called ' The Gates of Hell Opened, or a Develop-
ment of the Secrets of Nunneries,' and that we, at
present, are the owner of a copy of said book, which
was loaned by us, a year or two since, to.some person
in Marblehead or Salem, who has not returned it."
This statement was extensively circulated both
through the Catholic and Protestant papers, and mul-
titudes were led to believe that it was true. But time
has shown it to be otherwise. Miss Monkjs publish-
ers forthwith offered one hundred dollars, to any in-
dividual who would present them with a work thus
resembling the "Awful Disclo~ures." But the priest,
who fabricated and published the statement, and
who "was ready ancl willing to swear'' to his own
lie, has never been able to produce such a book.
The ground usually taken by the opponents of Miss
Monk is, "that she is a mere tool in the hands of
others," who have fabricated her disclosures, and

published them in her name. The writers ot the
"Awful Exposure" assume this position, as a truth
which needs no proof. Hence the title-page of their
book:-" Awful Exposure of the atrocious plot formed
by certain individuals against the Clergy and Nuns
of Lower Canada, through the intervention of Maria
Monk." Who tht'se individuals are, we are not in-
formed. But they are unmercifuJly denounced as,
"a band of fanatics," "an association of impostors,"
" abetters of Monk," "advisers ofMonk," "her crew,"
" infamous," "canting hypocrites," "calumniators"
"using Monic to convey their own slanders,"" rendered
insane by the instigations of their own malice," pos-
sessing "unparaJleled impudence and imbecility,"
"atrocious intentions," "minds prolific of calumny,"
''strange audacity," being unable "to construct a lie
of ordinary verisimilitude"-which by the way, is
equivalent to saying that they are not practised in
the art of lying.
On page 81 of their book, the priests speak as if the
" Awful Disclosures" were the production of some
one man ; whom they handle after their accustomed
manner. Say they:-" W hen this refutatior. and
these proofs shall meet the scurrilous and unhesita-
ting defamer, will he not seek to escape the light of
day and the regards of his fellow men'? The turbu-
lent current of his deliberate and blasphemous fanati-
cism will be heated by hot shame and unavailing re-
gret. The stupid and lying wretch, the base knave,
the imbecile criminal, will writhe in his anguish,
scorned and loathed by an insulted and indignant
community." Who the individual is, thus mauled: I
know not. But I think he must have been a name-
less man of straw, whom the priests, by this thunder

· · But the priests are not satisfied-or rather they
Ju9tty •think that the reflecting part of the community
:are ·Doi satisfied with either ofthesP. modes of account-
:ing ;for the origin of Miss Monk's disclosures. They
·have, therefore, recently lit upon auother, as novel as
it·is singular. They say that the materials, out of which
her disclosures were fabricated, were obtained by her
from the Montreal Magdalen Asylum. ·This is tru'y
'a marvellous discovery; and, in order that the reader
may be enabled to judge of its truth, it will be neces-
sary, here, briefly to state Miss Monk's connexion
with this establishment. This she has stated in her
first volume, pages 272-73; and the statement was
made by her1 long before her enemies even alluded
to the fact; and indeed, they appear to have first
learned it from her narrative. S he has stated all she
knew about it, though it appears that she was unac-
quainted with the nature of the establishmeut. She
states that she was never in the larger of the two
houses belonging to the Asylum, and of course knows
nothing about it. But when, how long, and how
came she in the Asylum 1 are questions which need
to be answered. It was in the winter of 1834-5, that
~ he was there, after she professes to have left the
nunnery. There is no disagreement on this point, be-
tw~e:l her and her opponents. There is, however,
as·•··it respects the length of time that she was ~here.
The Magdalens affirm that she was in the Asylum
about three months,while she thinks that she was there
but about six or seven weeks. It appears quite evi-
.dent that they are mistaken as to the length of time.

first of March, 1835. Now it is stated in the" Awful
Exposure," that she was rele~sed from jail on the
19th of November, and taken by her mother to the
Government House, of which she ia the keeper. And
it appears that she was at her mother's residence, for
several weeks before going ·to the: Asylum. She
could not, therefore, have been there for three
months.
But how came she in the Asylum 1 Her unfeeling
mother sent her there. But why should Mrs. Monk
place her in that establishment 1 It will be recol-
lected that Maria Monk had attempted to drown her·
self, and as a consequence, being considered an in-
sane vagrant, she had been imprisoned. · " Awful
Disclosures," 266-7. This attempt at self-destruc-
tion connected with her confin~ment, for a few days,
in jail, were considered by Mrs. Monk as disgracing
her family ; hence she wished to cover up the matter
as much as possible, by keeping her daughter con-
cealed from the eye of her friends. While Maria
remained with her mother, she was not allowed to
see any com}lany-this, however, was in accordance
with her own wishes, as she was in constant fear of
being apprehended by the priests-so that even her
own brother did not know that she was ~n the house,
until about two weeks after she entered it. But Mrs.
Monk becoming weary of keeping Maria after this
manner, procured a place for her in the Asylum, prob-
ably as a boarder. This conduct of Mrs. Monk, is
in perfect keeping with her general treatment of her
children-or at least of ~ome of them-which is any
thing rather than maternal. In consequence of he.
barbsuous conduct towards her oldest son, now a res
idenc of .New York, he .left her house when only

ten years of age. The same brutality which thus
drove her eldest son from under her roof, also drove
l1er eldest <laughter, Maria, to seek a refuge in the
nunnery. Much might be said on this subject, but
I forbear. 1
Maria Monk states that, during her residence in the t
Asylum, she kept her chamber from the day she enter~ I
ed1
until about the time she left it. She was in fee- l
ble health, though not as much so as she feigned her- 1
self to he, in order that she might be allowed to keep I
her room. Her motive was, the fear of being detect-
ed by the priests, one of whom-Father Bonin, cne ()
of the murderers of St. Francis-was the confessor a
of tile establishment. She states that she had as lit- a
tle·intercourse as possible with any in the house-not "
even seeing Mrs. McDonell above th;·ee or four times, tt
until the day r.he left the house. Hence the fact that p
Mrs. McDonell and a Miss Howard, both of :whom "

Having said thus much, we are now prepared to
inquire, whether Miss Monk did, m reality, obta.in
the matter of h t!;: disclosures from this Asylum, du-
ring the few weeks of her stay in one of its cham-
bers. But what could she have learned in this estab-
lishment, which bears any resemblance to the princi-
pal facts disclosed in her book?
I frankly confess, that I do not know what to say
on this subject, because of its gross absurdity. There
are some subjects that beggar all proof or disproof,
all explanation or illastration. They <lo not fall
within the sphere of argumentation. If a man wer~
to tell me that the proper place to learn temperance
principles was in a grog-shop, or that the sanctuary,
where Jehovah is worshipped in spirit and in truth,
and where his law and his gospel are faithfully ex-
pounded, was a fit place to learn all that is infamous
in crime-what could I say to him 1 Could I reason

of gathering the facl.s, narrated hy Miss Monk, 6-om

But the position cf the priests is so grossly absurd,
that I fear lest some may possibly think that I mis-
represent them; such may think that the priests
would be simply understood as saying, that Miss
Monk obtained her knowledge of conventual ceremo-
nies in the asylum. This, however, is not so. On
page 55, of their book, they say :-" In fact, there is
not, perhaps, a single lie told in the 'Disclosures,' for
which a similar (a practice in the asylum) origin
might not be found." Now, what are the practices
spoken of by Miss Monk, which the priests would
have us to believe are lies 1 Are they not those
which would disgrace a heathen and a publican 1
This strange resort of the priests, must convince
every unbiased mind, of the fact, that their cau~;e is
desperate. The mere statement of it, is enocgh to
expose its intrinsic absurdity.
Whether the astounding facts respecting the Hotel
Dieu nunnery of Montreal, which are narrated in the
"Awful Disclosures," be true or false, I hope to show
to the satisfaction of every honest mind, that Maria
Monk is the sole authoress of them.
The manner in which Miss Monk passed her time,
from the hour she left the convent, until she arrived
in New York, will be found narrated in the first four
chapters of her sequel, Awful Disclosllres, beginning
at page 257.
The affecting circumstances in which Mr. Hilliker
and his associates, first discovered Miss Monk, after
her arrival in New York, are briefly stated in the fol-

" John Hilliker, being duly sworn, doth depose and
say-that one day early in the month of May, 1835,
while shooting near the Third Avenue, opposite the
three mile stone, in company with three friends, I
saw a woman sitting in a field at a short distance,
who attracted our attention. On reaching her, we
found her sitting with her head down, and could not
make her return any answer to our questions. On
raising hP.r hat we saw that she was weeping. She
was dressed in an old calico frock, (I think of a green-
ish color,) with a checked apron, and an old black
bonnet. After much delay and weeping, she began
to answer my questions, but not until I had got my
companions to leave us, and assured her that I was a
married man, and disposed to befriend her.
"She then told me that her name was Maria, that
she had been a nun in a nunnery in Montreal, from
which she had made her escape, on account of the
treatment she ha~ received from priests in that insti-
tution, whose licentious conductshe strongly intimated
to me. She mentioned some particulars concerning
the convent and her escape. She spoke particularly
of a small room where she used to attend, until the
physician entered to see the sick, when she accompa-
nied him·to write down his prescriptions; and said
that shl? escaped through a door which he sometimes

'entered. She added, that she exchanged her ~ress
after leaving the nunnery, and that she came to New
York in company with a man, who left her as soon
as the steamboat arrived. She further stated, that
she expected soon to give birth to a child, having be-
come pregnant in the convent; that she had DQ frieq~,
and knew not where to find one ; that she thought
of destroying her life ; and wished me to leave her-
saying, that if I should hear of a woman being found
drowned in the East River, she earnestly desired me
never to speak of her.
" I asked if she had had any fo0d that day, to
which she answered, no; and I gave her money to
ge~ some at the grocery of Mr. Cox, in the neighbor-
hood. She left me, but I afterwards saw her in the
fields, going towards the river; and after much ur-
gency, prevailed upon her to go to a house where I
thought she might be accommodated, offering to pay
her expenses. Failing in this attempt, I persuaded
her, with much difficulty, to go to the Almshous~;
and there we gol her received, after I had promised
to call to see her, as she said she had something of
great consequence which she wished to communica~e
to me, and wished me to write a lett.er to Montreal.
"She had every appearance of telling the truth;
·so much so, that I h~ve never for a moment doubted
the truth of her story, but told it to many persons Qf
my acquaintance, with entire confidence in its truth.

she walked, as she has described the nuns as doing
in her 'Awful Disclosures.'
"I called at the Almshouse gate several times and
inquired for her; but having forgotten half of her
name, I could not make it understood whom I wished
to see, and did not see her until the last week. When
I saw some of the first extracts fron. her book in a
newspaper, I was confident that they were parts of
her story, and when I read the conclusion of the work,
I had not a doubt of it. Indeed, many things ;n the
course of the hook I was prepared for from what she
had told me.
" When I found her, I recognised her immediately,
although she did not know me at first, being in a very
different dress. As soon as she was informed where
she had seen me, she recognised me. I have not
found in the book any thing inconsistent with what
she had atated to me when I first saw her.
"When I first saw her in May, 1835, she had evi-
dently sought concealment. She had a letter in her
hand, which she refused to let me see ; and when she
found I was determined to remove her, she tore it 111
small pieces, and threw them down. Several days
after I visited the spot again and picked them up, to
-learn something of the contents, but could find noth•
ing intelligible, except the first part of the signature,
'Maria.'
"Of the truth of her story, I have not the slightest
doubt, and I think I never can until the nunnery i3
opened and examined. JoHN HILLIKER. :

closures," the priests say on page 122 of their book,
that:-" The earliest instigator of Monk'afabrications
appears to have been an individual named Hoyt."
Concerning this man they have much to say that is
untrue, to the disadvantage of Miss Monk. They
would have the world to believe, that there was an
improper intimacy between them, on their first arrival
at Mr. Goodenough's tavern in Montreal; and tb11t
this was observed by Judge Turner, of St. Albans,
Vermont, who accompani~d them to that city, for
the purpo.o;e of procuring a legal investigation of Miss
Monk's criminal charges against the priests. But
this is denied by the Judge.
However indiscreet Mr. Hoyt's management of
Miss Monk's affairs may have been, he appears to
have acted from upright motives, until a short time
before her book was completed for the press; when,
in attempting to secure its profits for himself, except
such as she needed for the immediate support of her-
self and child, he took a misstep, which involved him
in a multitude ofothers. Since then his conduct has
been very reprehensible. He has involved her in law-
suits, and occasioned her, besides much trouble and
vexation, the loss of considerable money. He is not
a " cast-off clergyman," as the priests call him; for
he never was a clergyman of any sect.*
..rhe important testimony of the Rev. Mr. Tappin
settles the question, both as to the origin of Miss
Monk's disclo3ures, and also her earliest acquaint-
ance with Mr. Hoyt.
• The bitter feelings which have existed, for some ten months
past, between Mr. Hoyt and Miss 1\lonk, is decisive evidence of
the fact, that there has been no collision between them, in ori·

The following statement respecting the ~ri_gin of
Maria Monk's disclosures, and her fir!it acquaintanc~
with Mr. Hoyt, has the sanction of the Rev. Mr.
Tappin, Chaplain, for several years past, of the Hu-
mane and Crimin1l Institutions of the city of New
York-a gentleman of unblemished character.
" In the summer of 1835, Maria Monk, authores!l
of the 'Awful Disclosures,' was 11eriously ill, and, as
she supposed, on the borders of the grave. In thi!i
situation, she sent for me, and with all the solemnity
of a dying hour, she communicated to me the priori-
pal statements respecting the Hotel Dieu nunnery
of Montreal, which she ha!> since published to the
world, in her disclosures. She did th1s by way of
penitential confession. Her object appeared to be,
not to criminate others, but to confess her own guilt,
and thus relieve her troubled conscience ; for she felt
that she had, in some sense, been a participator in the
horrid crime:i which she divulged. At the time,
it was very evident to my mind, that she had no idea
that her disclosures to me, would ever be made known
to the public. The impression, which I then receiv-
ed of her honest ~incerity, remains to this day unef-
faced. This was some time before her acquaintance
with Mr. Hoyt; who, having recently arrived ·in New
York from Canada, and having heard of her case,
called on me to make inquiries respecting it, and was,
by me, introduced to her acquaintance."
Here then we learn, when it was that Mr. Hoy!
first became acquainted with Miss Monk. Mr. Tap-
pin states that a short time after Miss Monk's con-
fession to him, he mentioned her case to a friend in
New York, under the expectation that it would have
been kept secret, at ]east for the time being. Mr.·
o•
~~ REPLY TO THE PRIESTS' BOOK:,
Hoyt, then recently from M~ntreal, called upon this
friend cf Mr. Tappin's, who communicated to him the
circumstances of the case. Hence the manner in
which Mr. Hoyt first heard of Miss Monk. And hav-
ing resided, as an agent for Sabbath schools, for some
time in Montreal, it was very natural that he should
feel an interest in the dieclosurcs which Miss Monk
had made. He accordingly sought an intervieY: with
her, and after consultation with her, and with a few
gentlemen in New York and Brooklyn, it was deem-
ed advisable that Miss Monk should go, as soon as
her health would admit of it, to Montreal a11d present
her criminal charges against the priests and nuns to
the civil authorities of that city for inve~~igatioa
She accordingly went, in company with Mr. Hoyt, to
Montreal.
Mr. Tappin's statement i~ of a. very impressive
character. Sufficiently so, it appears to me, to more
than outweigh all the opposing testimony, which the
opponents of Miss Monk have ever bet>n able to pro-
duce against the truth of her claims! There is some-
thing in the dying penitential confessions of an indi-
vidual, that precludes the possibility of intentional
misrepresentation. Such were the confessions of
Miss Monk, as she ~mpposed. She was then a Roman
Catholic, and as such, she suppost>d that the salvation
of her soul depended, in a great measure1 upon her
confessing t<' some minister of Christ before she died,
But then she supposed that her confessions would re-
main, locket} up in the breast of her confessor, as she
nad always been taught by the Roman priests.

of the highest character, will for ever silence the bois-

against certain nameless individuals, who, they say,
"have formed an atrocious plot agamst the clergy
and nuns of Lower Canada, through the interventiou
cf Maria Monk."
Copy of a letter from the editor of Miss Monk's
book, addressed to the Rev. J. J. Slocum, under d~te
of New York, Oct. 29th, 1836.
"You have requested from me a staiement of the
origin of the book called 'Awful Disclosurr.s,' &c.,
of the circumatances connect~d with hs prep..:ation,
a.uJ the motives of it~. publication.
"The fi•·st time I ever heard ofMiss Marhl Monk,was
in the month of October, 1835, when Mr. Hoyt called
01! me, in company with a friend of mine, (and, as I
afterwards under.stoou, at the suggestion of another
friend, a merchant of New York,) and proposed to
rue to write her narrative for publication. This I at
first declined, saying that my time was too much en-
grossed ; but being informed of some of the leading
particulars of her history and disclosures, (which are
now publicly known,) and assurE:d that her story was
worthy of investigation, I consented to devote a por-
tion of time to the subject for one week-that being
considered sufficient to perform at least an important
part of the task.
"It was stated to me at the time, that Miss Monk
had been unwilling, when first invited, to publish a
book, and that she might perhaps be prevented from
giving her testimony, t:.:.less advantage were taken of
the present time; and of the truth of these representll-
tions I afterwards became fully pe.rsuaded.
" ~n my first interview with Miss Mc.nk, I began to
!(}4 REPLY TO THE I'RIESTS' BOOK·.
note down briefly her statements; and this ! continued
to practise, with care, and all the accuracy I could;
during the many interviews which I afterwards !!ad~
I endeavored from the first to subjecJ her testimony
to the most rigid tests; and especially to try the con:.
sistency of her statements ; being satisfied that if th~
tale were not true, I should be able, first or last, tq
~..teet inconsistency. I often entertained suspicion8
of its truth ; and in order that I might detect and ex-
pose the imposture, I sought for evidence from differ··
eut qmuters. ·
"The narrator did not receive my confidence, indeed
she did not daim :t, independently of other testi:.
mony. She represented herself as accustomed to
syste~atic deception ; though then disposed to com-
municate "
the truth, and only the truth, on subjects of
moment connected with her experience and observa-
tion. I was but little acquainted with those pictures
of convents drawn by Roman Catholic writers; and,
although I had seen many of them in other countries,
and often. heard them condemned by foreigners of
intelligence an_
d virtue, many of them Roman Catho-
lics, I was not prepared to believe them the scenes of
crimes like those described by Miss Monk.
"I soon became satisfi~d that she had not fabdcated
her E::tory; for the originality and variety of characters
and scenes wJtich she introduced, appeared to me to
be beyond the invention of a young woman, onlr
nineteen or twentr years of age, scarcely able to
write intelligibly, arid to all appearance ignorant of
books, except a few such as may be used in nunrie-
ries and Canadian schools. I fouru.l foreign books,

disclosures, were evidently "uch as could not have
oe~n produced either by accidental conjecture, nor by
studied invention. On the contrary, they were of
scch a nature, and brought out in such connexions,
. as to show, beyond any reasonable doubt, that Miss
Monk drew, from recollec!ion, real scenes and char-
acters, with which she had been acquainted, in a so-
ciety fundamentally different from any known among
ourselves, or ever fully developed in any publications
I had seen or could discover.
"But there were other kinds of evidence to which
I had access. Although I never had entered the
Veiled Department of the Hotel Dieu, I had formerly
visited Montreal, and had more local acquaintance
with that city, than Mh:s Monk was at first aware of.
I had also means of testing some of her statements,
by resorting to the testimony of individuals, disposed
to render some assistance.
"Beside this, several scenes, ofmuch importance in
her narrative, had transpired in this neighborhood;
and some of the most impor~ant points connected
with the1.1, were confirmed by persons worthy of all
credit. We thus became satisfied, from an early
date, that she had been found in a friendless, exposed,
and suffering condition, and introduced into the Belle-
vue hospital ; that she was there sought for by Ro-
mon priests as a nun ; that she first made disclosures
when she supposed herself near death; that she af-
terwards visited Montreal, but failed in her attempt
to bring the }Jriests to trial ; and that, while on the
whole rather unwilling to divulge her story, she yet
appeared to regard the truth with scrupulous care, in
all the statements which she consented to make.

' ~d in conversation, and in her habits of thought, feel:
ing, and action, ever afforded powerful confirmation
of the truth of her story. She appeared to know
such things as a nun (according to her description of ~
a nun) would be likely to know; and to be ignorant I
of what such a person would be ign.orant of. Her ~
reflections, motives, fears, hopes, expectations, asso· a
ciations of ideas, supPrstitions and errors, were as r•
appropriate to the character to which she laid claim, d
a.s ;her Canadian dialect, to the city in which she p
pr.ofessed to have spent her life. The same may · be
said of her hasty, and sometimes tumultuous feel- fr
ings, when excited by apprehension or opposition ; g
the changeableness of her views, and the succes- fr
sive elevation and depression of her spirits. Her u
tnotives and reasons for speaking and acting, were s<
also often such as would be appropriate only to a re- p«
cluse, shut out.from the knowledge and sympathies e•
of the world, accustomed to be controlled by super'7 h
$tition, and liable to be subdued by force, when that o•
failed to .keep her within desired bounds. b
"She suffered a considerable part of the time, from ~
s~pers.itions, and other fears, which were sometimes b
almost too strong to be suppressed ; while a sense of
her friendless condition would at other times almost a
overcome her. She felt no personal interest in pub- v
Hshing her disclosures ; and the task was unpleasant r
!lnd laborious to her, while she thoup;ht it would ex- t
po~e ·her to many incc.Hveniences. Her expectations
of deriving pecuniary benefit from her book, may be
inferred from a single question she asked, when it
was in press. 'Do you think they will print as ·1

ever been her indifference to property. She has been
accused, by writers who spoke on conjecture, of hav-
ing fabricated her book for the sake of gain. A per-
son acquainted with her, would have be.en likely to
assign any other reason before this. In the first
place, !~he never proposed to publish it herself, and
\vas often half inclined to give over the undertaking;
and, in the second place, she has shown such a dis-
regard for money, that her friends have often found it
difficult to prevent her from giving away what she
possessed, to any person who wanted it.
"It was found difficult to obtain all the testimony
from Canada, which was to be desired. There were
gentlemen of high respectability, in New York, who
from the first scoutt!d the idea of Miss :Monk's hav-
ing been a nun ; and tHs was particularly true of
some of the Presbyterian clergymen; while it J.ap-
pencd that, for some time, only one of their number
ever was known to express a word in her favor. I
have no doubt, that had it not been for the exertio11s
of one or two laymen, Miss Monk's story would have
been rejected and suppressed, within the first few
weeks after her return from Montreal, and never have
been brought before the world.
· "•rhe opposition among the Presbyterian clergymen
alluded to, was found to be chiefly owing to letters
written by the R ev. Mr. Perkins, pastor of the Ame-
rican Pres.bvteria.n church, of Montreal, to warn
them against the impostures of Miss Monk, who, he
said, had never been a nun, and whose residence, he
stated, had been proved to have been among scenes
of vi~e, during a great part of the time when she
-oretended to ha ve been an inhabitant of the Hotei
·Dieu. ·su~h charges were coupled with accusations

·against Mr. Hoyt, who first mer with her in the Belle·
vue hospital, and accompa11:~d her to and from
Montreal. He had been the agent of a charitable
society in Mr. Perkins' congregation, (but was not a
clergyman, as had been erroneously; asserted.) Seve-
ral of the charges adduced by Mr. Perkins against
Mr. Hoyt, after an investigation here, were deemt'd
to be founded in mistake, and to have grown out of
the excitements of a personal difference between Mr.
Perkins and himself; and in this opinion some re-
spectable Americans, of Montreal, concurred.
"It then became a natural and important inquiry,
l10w far Mr. Perkins might have been led into errone-
ous conclusions concerning Miss Monk's history and
character, either by the circumstances above mention-
ed, or by the fact that she was countenanced whilst
in Montreal, by some persons connected with the
Free Church, then lately formed by a secession from
his own. ·when therefore it was stated, by a clergy-
man in a letter to New York, that there was satisfac-
tory evidence in the possession of respectable persons
in Montreal, to prove that Miss Monk had never been
a nun, a letter was addressed to Mr. Perkins request-
ing information, 1st, of the names of the witnesses,
and 2d, of the amount of their testimony.
"His reply com eyed none of the information asked,
but spoke of the aprlication as a deliberate insult.
Under these cir~amstances, the opinions of 'respecta-
ble persons, on the other side of the question, seemed to
merit some consideration, especially &s there were

"But there was another kind of evidence constantJy
before our eyes, which ever llfforded a strong corrobo·
ration of the story of Miss Monk, that is, its consis-
tency. All cross-questioning failed to confound or
confuse her ; and the familiarity with which she ex-
plained apparent inconsistencies at one moment, and
at another presented new scenes and characters, or
proceeded to develop them with new circumstances,
were as striking as the childish simplicity and igno-
rance which she often displayed in relation to things
of every-day occurrence among ourselves.
"It appeared to me utterly impossible, that a person
t~o young, and ill-educ:!ted and inexperienced in the
world, should be able to forge a tale so abounding in
scenes and characters, true to nature in the circum-
stances with which they were connected, yet ('ndless-

she should do all this in rapid conversation, and in
replying to qu~stions often designed to perplex her,
apparently without exertion or the slightest fear of
t>xposure. Such sketches of persons and occurrences.
as she has 'communicated, could not have been in-
vented by any ingenuity inferior to that of Scott or
Shakspeare, even if they might have been by one su-'

its nature, and the fact that it was designed to impose
upon· North Americans, should awaken the anxiety

What are his designs 'I would become natural and
reasonable questions. It therefore always ~ppeare.d to
me, that in every point ·of view the story ofMiss Monk
was worthy of investigation. '
"Several of the charges which have been made
agaim;t Miss Monk, have with reason been regarded
as affording evidence in favor of its truth. ·
"In the first place the book has not been copied or
formed, even in the smallest part, on any otlu!r. The
editor ofthe Boston (Roman Catholic) Pilot, solemnly
asserted, that a large part of it at least was copied
from an old Portuguese book he had possessed; but
while this was known to be utterly void of truth, the
charge gave us a strong confirmation of. its accuracy.
What better evidence cotdd be expected from the op-
position party, to prove that both the books were
faithful pictures of nunneries on both sides of the
Atlantic 1
"lil reply to several other charges it may be stated,
that it is known and can be proved, that the book \,·as
not written for the purpose of making money, The
primary object was the publication of important tru'th;
and its secondary, to procure the means of supporting
an unfortunate and friendless young female, and her
innocent babe. None of those who have assisted her
in preparing her book, or in defending it, have received
a fair equivalent for their time and labor ; ana, I
think I may safely assert, that all have repeatedly
declared they neither expecttld nor desired it. Th~ir
great object is the discovery of truth; and they will
hold themselves ready, if ever the fact shall be proved;
to confess that th~y have been deceived, and to make
all possible amends. The day when such evidence

Thus it·is evident, beyond all reasonable doubt,
that Miss Monk is the sole authoress of the facts,
contained in the disclosures attributed to her. And
it is proper to pause here a moment, and remind the
reader of the condition into which the advocates of
the nunnery have brought themselves, by endeavoring
to maintain their several positions, as to the origin of
her book, after it is thus rftHlered evident that they
cannot retain either one of them. The ground is
false, and their plea preposterouc;. 'l'!tey have there-

rendered very suspicious by heing thus driven back

MARIA MoNK affirms that she hRs been a nun in

statements respecting that establishment are such as
she knows, from her own experience and observation,
to be true. On the other hand, the priests anu their
advocates deny that she b!ls ever been an inmate of
that convent ; and, of course, maintr.in that her dis-
closures are so many fictions. The hinge, therefore,
on which the whp.le controversy turns, is the fact,

whether or not she has ever been a cloistered nun.
And, although this q'let~tion is distinct from the ques-
tion of the truth of her statements, in point of fact,
yt't, in the dis'.:ussion, they naturally run into each
other. The priests, on the one hand, attempt to draw
an argument from I he character of her disclosures, in
support of their position, that she has never been a
nun; while on the other hand, the friends of Miss
Monk reason from the same source, to prove that she
must have been an inmate of the nunnery. The for-
mer maintain that the crimes, which she alleges are
habitually practised by themselves and the nuns, are
incompatible with human nature; while the latter
argue that they are just what might be expected from
the circumstances of the case-that they are in perfect
accordance with the history of convents, and that a
girl in her situation cou'id never have become as
familiar with them as she is, unless she had been as-
sociated with a society addicted to their practice.
Hence the question, both as to the fact of her having
been a nun, and as to the truth of her disclosures,
are intimately blended in this discussion.
In this controversy, aside from truth, the priests
have greatiy the advantage. They are a numerous
and powerful body of men, skilled in the arts of con-
troversy. Miss Monk is an inexperienced girl, yet in
her youth, having no friends, except such as she has
gained by her apparent honesty and consistency,
since the controversy commenced. Moreover, from
a variety of circumstances, the mass of the people in
Canada are prejudiced in favor of the priests and
against her, so that they are disposed to afford them
any assistance in their power. This is the case to a
I
great extent, even with the Protestants', especially in
\
ue CONI'IaMATIOl'f OJ'
Montreal. Not only the ordinary relations which
bind society together exist between Catholics and
Protestants in Canada, but there are relations of a
special character existing in the present case. The
government, it is true, is nominally Protestant, but
then such is the state of parties there, that it requires,
in order tn its very existence, the 1=-atronage, to some
extent, of the priest~. This the wily priests give to
it; in order that they, in their turn, may receive the
special smiles of civil officers. Maria Monk states
another circumstance, respecting some few of the
more wealthy and nominal Protestants in nnd about
Montreal, which is, that they are licentious visiters of
the nunnery. If this be true, it exhibits a reason for
the violence of their opposition to her.
Another thing worthy of special notice is the fact,
that the field of nearly all Miss Monk's external testi-
mony is in the power of the priests. They have her
former associates and companions: nay, they have
her own blood-connexions, so completely under their
control and influence, as to restrain them from utter-
ing any thing favorable to her claims. They also
have the nunnery in their possession, and will not
allow it to be impartially examined. Hence the de-
mand for more external evidence, made by r,nany, is
unreasonable. Every subject has evidence appropri-
ate to itself; and that-and that alone ought to be all
that should be required.
The public press in Canada is either Catholic or
political. Hence it has from the first been violent in
its opposition to Miss Monk. It took its stand
agaiast her before she had published a single word.
Not a single art;c!e has ever been published there, so

exhibit the evidence in support of her truth. The
conseQuence is, that the people of Canllda are, in gen-
eral, profoundly ignorant in respect to the existence
of any such evidence ; and not only so, but they have
been led astray by the numberless misstatements,
which have been circulated by the pr!ests,· their
friends, and the Canadian press. Hence the strong
popular prejudice!!, which are believed to exiat to a
considerable extent in that province, against Miss
Monk.
I u.ight also remark respecting the horrid nature of
. the crimes, which M:ss Monk charges upon the
priests and nuns, in connexion with her own charac-
ter as a professed witness. By her own confession,
while in the convent, she lived in impurity, and was
taught the arts of deception and hypocri~y. ·Hence
an argument, very properly used to a limited extent,
against her as a witness. But, it may be asked, is
she not as good a witness as the nature of the case
can pvssibly furnish 1 If her story be true, are not all
the inmates of that convent alike in these respects 1
The criminal practices which she divulges are of the
deepest dye, insomuch that the more virtuo•Js portions
of society instinctively recoil at the very thought of
believing them. Hence they are predisposed to dis-
card them, without examining the· evidence of their
truth.
H ·t, notwithstanding all these difficulties, the evi-
dence in support of Miss Monk's claims, when col-
lected and intelligently considered, is irresistible.
The argument is cumulative. And I will now pro-
ceed, as succinctly as possible, to lay it before my
readers.
The character and conduct of Miss Monk furnish
. 118 CONFIRM.lTIOM OF
the strongest evidence in support of the general
truth of her claims, as a professed ex-nun.
1. Her incapacity to have acted the 1'art of an
impostor, is, in the ltighest degree, evident to all
1Dho are personally acquainted with her.-The co·
gency of this arguro~nt is acknowledged by her oppo·
neuts. Hence they deny that she is the authoress of
tht:- disclosures attributed to her. They maintain
that she is a mere tooi, in the hands of others, who
ha'!e fabricated and published them in her name.
But this, I trust, has been shown to the satisfaction
of the reader, to he untrue. It has been shown, that
she, and she alone, is the authoress of the dark tale,
which she has pablishecl to the astonishment of the
people of thi~ country.
Miss Mor,k is young, and possesses a mind alto·
gether undisciplined by study. Her education is in-
ferior to that of ord\nary country girls. Habits of
study she has none. Her knowl~dge of books is, cr
was when she first arrived in New York, next to no-
thing. And, if the " Awful Exposure" gives us a
true history of her life, she has never been either a
nun, or a Roman Catholic ; but "has Jed the life of
a stroller and a prostit1.1te." If this be true, it is ask-
ed, how a girl of her age, character, and attainments,
could possibly fabricate such books as her "Disclo·
sures ?" The supposition beggars all belief, but that
of blindness. If she has fabricated them, Rome,
with its numberless saints, may be fearlessly chal-
lenged to produce a miracle any thing like as great.
Besides, on the supposition, that she h&d fabricated
her "Disclosures," it is impossible that she should
have been able to act the part of an impostor, up to
the present time, without being detected. Many

minds have heen at work, for more than ii year past,
endeavoring to develop 1-.er true character. Both
friend3 and foes have bee~1 thus employed. Had she
been an impostor, it would have been discovered,
long before this day. She constitutionally possesses
transparency of character, to an uncommon degree.
Hence the predommant workings of her mind are
very apparent, to a penetrating observer. She has very
li~tle of that systP.matic concealment and forethought,
so necessary to a successful impostor. Her openness
of character, constitutionally considered, is almost the
first thing observed, by an intelligent stranger who
may chance to see and converse with her. Hence, if
such a person has been skeptically disposed !n regard
to the general truth of her claims, his skepticism, in
perhaps nineteen cases out of twenty, has been re-
moved by a free conversation with her. Such an in~
dividual readily perceives, that her mental constitu•
tion is such, as totally to disqualify her to act the
part of protracted imposture.
The argument, therefore, under this head, is two-
fold·-being fuunded, Is~, On her incapacity to create
her "Disdosures"-2d, On the supposition that she
possessed such ability, her incapacity to have suc-
cessfully concealed her imposture, up to the present
time.
2. Her minute and extensive nunnery knmoledgt,
connected 1vith tlte ease and dexterity ·with which
she can petform the ·many ceremonies of a conve-nt;
can be accounted for, on no other supposition, than that
of her having been a nun, as she states. Her prac-
tical knowledge of Popery and Jesuitism, of priests
and nuns, of the furniture and diversified apartment!
of the Hotel Dieu, of the ceremoniea and practices
120 CO:ofi'J.RMATIOif OF
of that establishment, is such as could have been ac-
quired by her, only by a residence of years in that
convent. She is as familiar with the mummery of
Popish observances, as a school-boy is with his al-
phabet-such as penances, hymns, Latin prayers, &c.
&c., though she is as ignorant of the meaning of
Latin words, as she is of the Chinese language. The
same is true w•th reference to the ease with which
she performs the various bodily ceremonies, some of
which she speaks of in her book, such as falling upon
the knees, and standing erect upon them, &c. &e.
With the Romish catechisms, she is perfectly famil-
iar. In a word, she is, in regard to these matters, all
that we might suppose her to be, on the supposition
that she has, for years, been a resident in the convent.
Speaking in the language of common life, "she has
learned her trade." And no man, in his senses, can
understandingly deny it. How, then, can this evi-
dence be resisted 1
3. Her ignorance of life, disconnected fi·om con-
,ents, can be accounted for, only on the supposition
of her having lived a conventual life. I spt>ak now
with special reference to what she was, when she first
arrived in New York, in the spring of 1835. At that
time, her acquaintance with matters and things, as
they appear in the domestic cucle, and in ordinary
life, was very limited. She was evidently a compar.:.
ative stranger to them; whilst all her movements
and manners were such, as bespoke her former life
to have been that of a cloistered nun. Says Mr.
Hilliker, in his affidavit :-" We observed also, that
she always folded her hands under her apr~n when
ehe walked, as she has described the nuns M doing

4. The mark. on her person, which were produced
Dy suffering penances, and other violent treatment,
afford an argument in support of her claims. She
has several of these, as she states in her first volume.
She speaks of having worn a broad belt around her
waist, "stuck full of sharp iron points, for the morti-
fication of her spirit." The writer of this has been
informed hy a respectable lady, who examined Miss
Monk's waist, that the scars produced by this belt,
are very manifest. To use her own language "it
looks distressing." . '
The marks of gagging are seen on her lips; and
ther~ are scars also on her thumbs, which were "cut
severely by the tight drawing ofthe band used to con-
fine her arms." These are the signs of Roinish pen-
ance and violence. But the "Awful Exposure" tells
us that she has never been a Roman Catholic !
5. The circum.stancea, in connexion with which
she was first dis~overed by Mr. Hilliker; and his as-
sociates, after her arrival in the city of New York
afford an argument in proof of Miss Monk's honesty:
See Mr. Hilliker's affidavit on page 97. She was
discovered by Mr. Hilliker and his compamons in a
retired place, above the city of New York, where she
had secreted herself for several days, and where she
had evidently made up her mind to die. She was
not far from death when thus found ; and it was witlt
much difficulty that she was prevailed upon to leave
the place of her concealment. Nay, she declined
leaving it, until she saw that the gentll.aen were de-
termined to remove her by force, unless she would go
voluntarily. She had already become so feeble as to
need to be supported, by two of the gentlemen, in
walking the distance of half a mile, to .the .alms-
11
12~ CONFIRMA'l'lO:S OF ·
house. She was in a strange country, under cireum-
stances peculiarly distressing. After Mr. Hiiliker
had conversed with her some time alone, and assured
her that he was a married man, and that he wished
to befriend her in every way he could, she stated to
him, that she was an eloped nun, and that she be-
came enciente in the convent. He states that h'e·
found her in tears, and that she wept for two hours
afterwards. He has mentioned several circumstances·
in his affidavit, all of which bear the marks of honest
sincerity, on the part of Miss Monk. It is impossible·
to account for them on any other supposition thin
that she told the truth, as to her elopement from the·
nunnery. It is impossible, that such circumstances
should mislead, for they cannot testify falsely, as guil-
ty man can, and often does, do.
6. The circumstances in connexion with which
Miss Monk first divulged the principal facts recorde_J
in her book, are such as to afford the strongest evi-
dence in support of her claims to public confidence.
These are detailed in the statement of the Rev·. Mr.
Tappin, on page 101. She made known these facts
to him by way of penitential confession, while sick in
the almshouse, and as she supposed, ready to die.
Mr. T appin states that it was perfectly manifest to
Ius mind, that she had no idea of criminating others,
or that her statements would ever be made public.
She and others thought, that she was on the borders
of the grave, and she wished to quiet her troubled
conscience, by confessing what she considered to be
her grossest sins. She was still a Roman c~tholic;
it was therefore in perfect accordance · with the reli~
gion. she. had been ta,lght, thus to confess. There

124 CONFIRMATION OF
Her circumstances have been peculiarly trying, an
sing in part from her comparative ignorance of the
world, connected with the discredit which has been
thrown upon her statements, and the consequent
violent denunciations which have been heaped upon
her by Protestants, especially editorR of newspapers,
who have taken very little pains to investigate the
subject. Often has she felt, as if she had scarcely a
real friend on earth-as if all the wodd was against
her, making her the helpless victim of its combined
contempt and indignation. Yet amidst all her trials,
she has exhibited, to those around her, that she felt
an unwavering consciousness of standing upon the
truth; and that the God of truth would one day vin-
dicat~ her honesty. Being possessed naturally of an
unusual degree of sensibility, and feeling her forlorn
situation, it is true, she has often wept in secret.
places, for having published her dark story, not be-
cause of its untruth, but becau&e of the cruel treat-
ment she has received in consequence of it.
She has invariably manifested a very strong desire
that the truth of her charges against the Roman
priests and nuns of Lower Canada, might be tested
by some equitable tribunal. Hence her visit to Mont-
real for this purpose, in the August of 1835, and before
she ever thought of publishing a book. She then and
there solemnly appealed to the civil authorities, to
investigate their truth. .She was accompanied by
•.wo American gentlemen, ofthe legal profession, who
assisted her in presenting her charges in due form,
attested on oath, to the Attorney General for prosecu-
tion. And after spendiug some three or four weeks,
in fruitless attempts to secure the object of her visit,

MARIA MONE's DISCLOSURES. 115
While at Montreal, it was denied by the pnett.
that she had ever been an inmate of the Hotel Dieu.
She at once offered a fair test of the fact, which, by a
very little trouble, would have settled the point lleyond
the power of contradiction. She proposed a descrip-
tion of the interior of the convent-its furniture, its
inmates and different apartments, and their uses-
and staked her ' all upon its correctness. But the
application of it was not allowed by her opponents;
on what ground, no mortal can conjecture, unless it
were that they were afraid to abide the results. -
On the fourteenth day of last July, I received a let-
from the Rev. Mr. Perkins of Montreal, informing
me, that on the following day a committee of gentle-
men were to apply the test, which she had proposed
nearly one year before. The thought immediately
occurred to me, if she be an impostor I can now dis-
cover it, by comm~nicating to her this unexpected
intelligence. I applied the test, in the best manner
to accomplish the end in view, that I was capable of;
and the result was such, as decidedly deepened my
convictions of her honesty. Other particulars might
be mentioned, were it necessary, all going to show
the consistency of her conduct; with the supposition,
ihat she feels herself standing upon the rock of truth.
On the other hand, if she be an impostor, her con-
duct has been, in the highest degree, preposterous and
unaccountable. Suppose that she bad described the
interior of the Magdalen Asylum of Montreal, instead
of the Hotel Dieu nunnery. She certainly must have
been sensiblP of the fact. And if so, is it supposable
that she would have gone to Montreal, for the purpose
of substantiating crimes, of the darkest hue, against
the Hotel Dieu ecclesiastics ; atld there make oath

·that abe had resided for years in ttae eonvent, where
.she -had witnessed their commission; and in pro~f,
.that she had thus resided in the convent, offer a de-
scription of the persons, furniture, and the interior ar·
-rangements of the Montreal Magdalen Asylum 1
The supposition is absurd, beyond the power of lan-
guage to express. Ifshe be an impostor, the extremes
of unparalleled genius, and the most stupid folly and
ignorance, meet in her. Considering her youth and
limited opportunities, she has exhibited a talent for
invention, in her works, compared with which th"
PQWers of Sir Waiter Scott are but as a drop to the
ocean; while on the other hand, she has evinced
stupidity, if possible more remarkable, in staking her
all upon the general truth of her desl!ription of the
interior of a huge building, of which she is as igno·
rant as she 1s of the palace of the king of China.
And then, to crown her folly, she has urged, with an
importunity that would accept of no denial, the a·p-
plico.tion of this test, which she must have known
would have procured her inevHable and hopeless ruin.
To believe, therefore, that she' is an impostor, when
the belief implies such an absurdity, I must say for
one, I cannot, without a degree of insanity which it
.would require, at least, as many as two "pencils"
in each ear to produce.
8. The artless manner in 'Which .Miss Monk nar·
ratea the principalfacts in her disclosur<?s, furnishes
a cogent argur-!t·....;t in support of her claims. This
may be called the internal evidence ofthe truth of her
book. The first ten or fiftetn thousand copies of her
work were given to the public, accompanied with no
o~ber evidence than this. Immense multitudes who
read thE' book, believed it, because they perceived t~at

it bore the internal marks of truth, notwithstanding
some of its statements divulged the perpetration of
crimes, by priests and nuns, under the cloak of reli-
gton, of so horrid a character as to make an honest
man shudder at the thought of them. I will mention
some two or three things which have been urged as in·
temal marks again~t the truth of the "disclosures;"
bJJt which, it appears to me, afford evidence in its favor.
The circumstances connected with the murdn of St.
Frances, is one of these. It is said " that its com-
parative publicity, and the number of individuals em-
ployed in it, are marks of its falsehood." Thus argues
the Rev. Mr. Perkins of Montreal. Now,·in the first
place, there was no publicity about it, except such as
belonged to the convent. It was done within the
walls of the nunnery, shut out from all communica·
tion with the world. In the second place, the fact,
when understandingly considered, that so many were
employed in it, is a circumstance corroborative of the
truth of the narrative. Two reasons may be assigned
for this :--1. It is the policy of such establishments
thus to do, for the double purpose of inspiring terror
at the thought of disobedience, and at the same time,
implicating all present in the crime committed. It
had this effect on Maria Monk. Hence her peniten-
tial confession, at the time she thought that she was
going to di(. > the Rev. Mr. Tappin. The second
reason is this, that it was a regular court, or inquisi-
torial tribunal, the bishop presiding as inquisitor gene-
ral. TheRe". W. C. Brownlee, D. D. of New York,
a gentleman as well versed in the history of popish
jurisprud<mce as any other Protestant in America,
mentioned this fact to me, as affording, to his mind,
one of the strongest internal marks in the book, of its·
-128 CONFutMA'J'ION OF
t.-b. Now Maria Monk knows nothing or these
:reatOJJI; all she knows is the simple fact, that such
* euch persons were present, and that they did as
she stntes in ber narrative. Had she forged the story,
:Undoubtedly she would have made it a more private
~air, and would have created reasons for every thing
connected with it. But as it is, it bears the stamp of
simple truth.
Maria Monk, on page 195 of ·her work, says that
she once saw a book in the superior's room, contain-
ing, among other things, a record of births which
occur in the convent. Now it is asked, "if infants
are immediately baptized and strangled after their
birth, what can be the object of such a record 1 Why
expose1 themselves, by mak,ing a.record of· their own
crime 1" Now, as in the case above, Miss Monk it
incapable oi assigning any reason why such a record
should be kept. All she knows, or pretends to know,
is the simple fact that such a record then existed.
Undoubtedly, if she were .an impostor, she never
would have created the statement, without creating a
reason for it at the same time. The same may be
said respecting there being no balu:;trade around the
"hole of.interment," described by her as existing in
the cellar of the Hotel Dieu. Had the description
been the work of fancy, fancy would have given us a
suitable balustrade.

and gave form to Miss Monk's disclosures, I am qu~te.

amanuensis, in so examining her as to render it im-
possible for her to have acted the part of an impo!!tor.
Miss Monk's mind is undisciplined, and is wholly
un~ccustomed to connected thought and orderly ar-
rangement. Hence her statements have all the sim-
plicity and want of connexion of those of a child.
This circumstance would have enabled her writer to
have caused her to contradict herself in her narrations,
had she not been based on the truth.
Miss Monk's narrative is consistent with it!!elf and
with reason. It is minute and specific in its details,
respecting places, persons, and facts.' In a word, it
has every internal appearance of truth. How can all
this be accounted for, if she be an impostor 1
9. The moral character of Mis1 Mun1l:'8 mind,
for many months after her arrival in New York, was
such as to furnish a high degree of evidence in sup-
port of her pretensions. She told us how and where
she had lived for several years past. The moral con-
dition of her mind bore its unequivocal testimony to
the truth of her narrative. She informed us of t~e
systematic deceptions which were inculcated and
practised in the society with which she had been
connected. The painful truth of this statement,
was easily discovered in the state of her mind. It
was seen that for her to speak truth, when a slight
temptation to deviate from it, presented itself, requir
ed an effort on her part. Truth•being the basis of
confidence, the latter, as matter of course, cannot ex-
ist in the absence of the former. It was, therefore,
evident that the inmatea of the Hotel Dieu, could
place little or no confidence in each other ; and that
jeaiousy and suspicion would naturally exist, to a
fearful extent, in such a community. . Thus it was
180 C...>NI'IHMA'rlON OF
with Maria Monk ; ulthough constitutionally iho
posseeecs the Gppositc quali\ies. She was suspicious
of evc.rybClly, and could confide in nobody. 'ro re-
pose full confidence in those around her, was a lesson,
which it took her some time to learn. In a word, ac-
cording to her statements, the character of the com-
munity with which she had been living, was pccu- ·
liar, such as cannot be found in civilized life; but
only in n .~loistered convent. It was in a high de-
gree selfish, subject to the violent exercise of the
darker passions of depraved human nature; such as
constant fear, jealousy, want of confidence, suspi-
cions, subjection to absolute authority, not out of re-
spect, but from fear, irritability, growing out of a
forced,!;ubmission to a code of contemptible ceremo:
nies ; in fine, the absence of whatsoever is pure,.
lovely, ond of good report, in the female' character.
She bore the impress of this wretched community on
her soul, thus evincing the character of the education
she had received ; although, as I had occasion. to re-
mark before, the moral text.ure of her mind, oonstitu-
tionally considered, is directly tbe opposite.. She is
naturally liberal, even to excess, open, frank, affec~
tionate, and confiding; and these traits of character
have been, for some time past, rapidly developing
themselves.
Ther.e can he no stamp without a corr.esponding
seal. But Miss Monk'!!! character furnishes us witb
a stamp or impress, altogether peculiar; and the
.question is, where is the seal or counterpart 1 If it
does not now exist, it certainly must have ~xisted at
the time the impression was made. I repektt the

u. Let' the priest8, then, tell the world where it can
btl found ; otherwise the world most believe Maria
Monk.
Such is n summary view of the arguments, in ·
confirmation of Miss Monk's claim to public confi. .
dcnce, as deduced from her character, per~on, con-
duct, and narrative. They are susceptible of much
P.Xpansion, as my object has been, rather to suggest
thought, than to expand it. The evidence thus de-
rived, is of n character peculiarly strong and con-
vincing. It is of an internal character, such as an
enlightened mind loves to confide in. It is the spon-
taneous testimony of natm·e. And can nature bear
false witnes31 Impossible I It is true, nature may,
to some extent, be counterfeited ; or we may mistake
her voice, and attribute testimony to her, which she
does not give, and thus deceive ourselves and others.
But it is impo~sihle that she should utter any thing,
but what is strictly true. Now, it is possible that
myself and others, have mi!linterpreted the language
of nature in the present instance; though I declare,
that I cannot realize it. Hence, if there were no
other e\·idence in confirmation of Miss Monk's testi-
mony to be found, I should feel that I stood on firm
ground, in endeavoring to support the truth of her
claims as an ex-nun. For I feel, that the statements
and affidavits of interested men, in opposition to the
evidence adduced in this chapter; are of no value.
In the scales of moral evidence, they are lighter than
a breath. They are like chaff to the wheat; fit only
to be given to the four winds of heaven. Unbelieving
Protestants may hence learn what has been the prin-
cipal ground, on which the friends of Miss Monk, in
New York, have stood, amidst the clamorous deuun·

IT i1 often asked, why the friends of Miss Monk,
provided she has resided for years in the Hotel Dieu,
uo not produce the testimony of a sufficient number
of living witnesses, to establish the fact, beyond the
power of contradiction. If a person has lived for
years in a given place, it is asked, is it not an easy
matter to prove it, by a multitude of witnesses 1 I
answer that it is, ~n ordinary cases. But the case of
Miss Monk is peculiar; perhaps without a parallel
on the pages of history. Her residence has been in a
cloister~d nunnery, shut out from the world. Since
she escaped from the convent, she has made known
the vile practices of her forintlr associates, the priests
and nuns; and they, in self-defence: deny that she
was ever one of their number. Moreover, by their
management thtly have sealed the lips of her friends,
out of the nunnery, in Canada, who might otherwise
testify as to the place of her former abode. Had the
matter heen otherwise managed at first, doubtless
witnes~es in abunda!ice could have been found, who
would have testified to the fact of her former residen~
in the Hotel DiPu Rut it was nc,t attended to, unts
12 '
134 CONFiRliU.TIOM OF
the priests had every opportunity they could desire,
to arrange matters according to their wishes. Go to
Montreal now, and inquire of its older inhabitants, if
they ever knew Maria Monk, and many of them will
tell you that they used to see her, some six or seven
years ago, at her mother's residence and at other pla-
ces, but that they saw nothing of her during the time
in which she alleges herself to have been in the nun-
nery. They all say, that during this period of time,
they have missed her; but as to the fact, whether or
no she was in the convent, during this time, they
know nothing about it. ·
The following is a specimen of the kind ofevidence
alluded to. A few days since, I saw a lady from
Montreal, who observed, that, a short time ago, she
was conversin; with a Mrs. **** of Montreal, a re-,
spectable and 0 hristian lady, who stated, that she had
known Maria Monlc from her childhood ; and that the.
last time she ever saw h2r, was about the time she
says that she returned from St. Denis and entered
the nunnery-that she (M. M.) then called on he~
(Mrs.****) to obtain money from her, for her motberi
and that she let her have some, though less than
what sh.e asked for. Now it will be recollected that
Maria Monk states, on page 38 of her book, that s~~
did obtain .money from several individuals~ on her
mother~s account, in .order to pay her entrance into
!he novi<'es' dep~rtment of the Hotel Dieu. .
T he following extract of a letter, from a worthy
gentleman.in Montreal, who has taken some pains to
mvestigate this matter, will enable the reader to un-
derstand something of the state of feeling, respecling
thi? subject, in anu about that city. After detaHing,th~

inquiries of those ·who ought to know something of
Miss Monk's past history, he writes as follows:-
·"Now the fact is just here, everybody is afraid to
know any thing ahout this matter: and all her rela-
tives ·seem backward to say what they might on the
~object. Romanism is so far predominant here, that
.there are only a very few who have· correct principle
andmoral courage enough to think, 8peak, or act,aright
in the concern. Political, pecuniary, and relative in-
terests and connexionEl, have occasioned such a com-
mingling of Romanism and Protestantism, that it is
difficult to reach the black heart of the Roman beast,
nominal Protetsants are so much in the way, A
bookseller said to me yesterday, that he and all the
other booksellers in the town were afraid to keep
Maria Monk's book in their stores, lest a mob should
attack them."
The subjoined testimony of Mr. Miller and Mrs.
Hahn has been some time before the public. That
of Mrs. Hahn is the more important. It is that of un
old companion, and of course there can be no mistake
as to her acquaintance with Miss Monk. Mrs. Hahn
described the person of Miss Monk, and stated the
.substance of her testimony before ~be saw her ; and
before Miss Monk knew any thing of Mrs. Hahn's
reRiding in New York. Collusion, .therefore;between
the parties is out of the questio41. Mr. ]ones, while
in New York, inquired of me what I should say re-
.specting Mrs. Hahn's testimony, if she herself were
to acknowledge that it was fah.e. I replied that it
would not in the least shake my confidence in its sub-
stantial truth, for such were the circumstances con~
neeted .with the ~iving of it, that my reliance was

chiefly upon them. Mrs. Hahn, however, rem;uns
unchanged as to the truth of her statements.
Mr. William Miller, a resident of New York for
several year~ past, and formerly an old schoolmate
of Maria's in Montreal, testifies that, on a visit to the
latter city, in the ~Summer of 1833, he called on Mrs.
Monk, the mother of Maria, and inquired for Maria ;
and was informed by her that her daughter Maria
was then in the nunnery. See his affidavit, Awful
Disclosures, page 237.-The priests, in their work,
dispose of this affidavit by exhorting Mr. Miller to
repent!
Mrs. Hahn, now a re~ident of New York and for-
merly a schoolmate of Miss Monk, testifies that she
was with Maria in the school of the Congregational
~unnery for about two years : that she was present
at the time that Maria was received as a novice in
the Hotel Dieu; and that she saw her some time after
this, while she was yet a novice: and that she saw
her a veiled nun, towards the close of the winter of
1833-4, in the hospital of the Hotel Dieu, which she
at that time frequently visited, in order to see a sick
friend: and that "a short time afterwards," she saw
her again in the same place among the veiled nuns.
See her testimony, Awful Disclosures: page 238.-
The circumstances connected with the giving of this
testimony were such, as to preclude almost the pos-
sibility of an error. The reader will see some of
these by referring to the whole of her testimony.
T he authors of the "Awful Exposure" glide over this
by a contemptuous sneer ! A summary way of dis-
posing of important _
testimony.

formed on evidence more ·or less concltJsive, which
ought to have its weight in determining this contro-
versy. There is the opinion of a large number of in-
dividuals, who have taken some considerable painR
to inform themselves on the subject, not only by read~
ing what has appeared in print on both sides of the
question, but also by ~ueh an examination of Miss
Monk, as has been satisfactoJ"y to themselves.
Among this class are to be found men of the first
stanJing in the different learned professions. I know
that this is mere opinion, and as such I give it for
what it is worth.-There is another class of persons,
whose opinion ou_ght to have still more weight, be-
cause their opportunities for forming it have been
much greater. Among these are the different fami-
lies in which Miss Monk has resided, since she came
to reside in New York. The celebrated Whitefield, I
think it was, was once asked his opinion respecting a
certain individual, with whom he had some acquaint·
ance. His reply was, that he did not know him, hav-
ing never been with him in his family, the only plac~
in which a man's true character could be disco·vercd.
Thus it is in regard to Maria Monk; her true charac-
ter is easily discovered by those with whom she daily
associates. And these, I think I m?y say without a
single exception, are thoroughly convinced that she is
not an impostor. The affidavits. of all Canada could
hardly·shake their belief.
To these I would add the unwavering opinh:m of
the gentleman who penned her works for her. He is
a gentleman of high standing in the community, for
literature, integrity, and piety. No man could h~we
felt a deeper solicitude .on the subject, than he has
fdt. , He has felt. that not ·only his own reputatio~

was at stake, but that truth-to him priceless-was
to achit>ve new 'Victories, or receive detriment, ac-
cording as Miss Monk'~ testimony should prove true
or false. Hence he has spared no pains to get at the
simple truth of the case, whatever that might be.
I trust that the reader will not consider it out of
place, for the writer of these pages to add his own
opinion to the above. It is now soine E'i~~h~ or nine
months, since Miss Monk came to reside u1.wng the
people of my pastoral charge. During this time •
have seen her in a variety of circumstances ; have!
heard her converse with friends and enemies, Prote~t
ants and Catholics, and men of all professions; have
improved every opportunity, which God in his provi-
dence has given me, to ferret out the truth in relatian
to her claims-and as the result of the whole, I delib-
erately !!lay, that I have never seen any thing which
led me, for any length of time, to doubt the general
truth of her story; but on the contrary, the evidence
oi its truth has been constantly augmenting, so that I
could now almost as easily believe any supposable
impos~ibility, a9 to believe that she has been acting
the part of an impostor, in what she has done.
The other class of individuals whose opinion is ot
some importance on the subject, are those who know
a part of Mi!1s Monk's statements to be true, and who
infer from that, the truth of the remainder. Among
these are to be found, those females scattered through
the country, who received their education in the
Congregational Nunnery of Montreal. A short time
since, I heard one of. this class speaking on the sub-
ject, after the following manner :-"Miss Monk's de-

Congregations! Nunnery of Montreal, are generally
so correct, that I cannot but think, that her descrip-
tions of things and practices in the Hotel Dieu, the
cloistered part of which I was never permitted to
visit, are also generally correct." I have heard gen-
tlemen who have long resided in Montreal, and who
were familiar with matters a!l~ things without the
::oncealed part of the convent, reason in a similar
manner.
It is known to many, that there is a subterranean
passage, leading from the priest's Seminary to the
Hotel Dieu. In addition to what is !'atd on pages 241
and 332 of Awful Disclosures, respecting this ·paasage,
the following, taken from the St. Albans Franklin
Journal, is subjoined. Even Mr. Jones, die publisher
of the "Awful Exposure," admitted, to several gen- ·
tiemen in New York, that there was such a passage ;
but that it was not more than thirty feet long! The
existence of this passage is known to many in Mont-
real. What is the object of such a passage 1 Can·
any thing virtuous require that a house of priests
should be thus united, by a concealed, under-ground
passage, to an establishment of secluded women 1
And I would further ask, how a man, who believes
in the existence of such a secret communication, can
disbelieve the "Awful Disclosure!" of Maria Monk 1.
If the priests are such licentious hypocrite!'!, as to need.
a dark, under-ground pt.ssage to the women of .the.
Hotel Dieu, from the commission of what crime
would they abstain, which the'Y considered necessary ·
to conceal their infamy from the publi~ eye 1 Would
they refrain from the murder of infants and nuns 'f

depravuy, that can believe they would. The follow-
ing is the communication alluded to.
. " As there is some excitement in the community
upo,n the subject of Popish licentiousness and vice
from the disclosures of Maria Monk, and as some af~
feet to disbelieve and ridicule her work as totally
false, being in possession of some strong evidence
that will confirm her statements, I give the public
the facts.
"In conversation with a gentleman, who was some
months since a Roman Catholic in Montreal, but has
renounced their blasphemous dogmas, and is now 'a
professed Christian, he told me, that he had been em-
ployed to labor in the cellars of the Priests' Seminary
at Montreal, and whilE.> there.engaged, he discovered
·a door in the wall of the cellar, which on opening, he
found it connected with a passage under ground. He
entered the passage and passed through it until he
came to some stairs, at the head of which was n trap
door. From the direction and distance of the passage,
he was perfectly certain that it must be a subterraile-
ous communic;1tion between the Seminary and the
convent. He further informed me, that from the tes-
timony of many fema:les, his relatives not excepted;
that at confession, the priests were in the habit of
asking the most licentious and revolting questions
that.could be propounded, not only to married ladies,
but also to girls of thirteen years.
"Likewise from the habiliments of the nuns, and·
their appearance at times, he was wholly confirmed
in the belief that their course in the nunnery was.any ,
thing but virtuous. At the time of. his making these
disclosures, I think Maria had not· written her .book.
I think testimony ofthis kind is powerfully corrobora-

tive, and that these things exist, I fully believe. Itis
truly painful to come before the public with so offl'ln-
sive a subject, but believing the contagion of death to
be spreading through the community by Catholicism~
leaving putrescence and wo behind, I feel constrained
thus to appear. "E. SPRAGUE.
"St. Albam, July, 1836."
The ensuing statement is from a gentleman who
was for many years a resident in Montreal. For
reasons satisfactory to himself, his name is withheld.
His testimony is undoubtedly true.
"I often heard of a subterranean passage, from the
Seminary to the Hotel Dieu nunnery, years ago; and
while the cathedral was building, I often saw that
part of it which was opened in digging for the founda-
tion. It was near the east corner of the cathedral,
where the waterworks were laid along St. Joseph's
street. Several years before, I saw the same paseage
opened in another place by the workmen, who had
removed several ;.tones ana exposed it to view. I
have often heard itspoken of, as a thing very generally
known ; and never heard any doubt of its existence,
until the appearance of Mr. Jones' book, and Mr.
Stone's pamphlet."
The following documents on the subject of the
subterranean passage, are extracted from the Ameri-
can Protestant Vindicator, of November 2, 1836~
They have appeared since the above was written:-
"The first witness is the Rev. Oliver Wetmore, of
Utica. In a late conversation with that beloved min-
ister of the gospel, he thus remarked-
" Mr. Stone says: 'No subterranean passage be-
tween the Seminary and the Hotel Dietl nunnery, ac
CONFIRMATION OF
Montreal, was ever seen or heard of!" That i8 not
true! When I travelled a$ a missionary in the ·north-
.ern parts of the State of New York, thirty~th1·ee
-pears ago, 1 was frequently at J.he house of Judge
Moers, who resided about a mile from the q;~n.~d.a
li~e. T~at gen!leman repeatedly talked with 1qe r~­
specting the Roman priests and Pop~ry, in Mon_
treal,
which he had often visited. He spoke of the subter-
ranean passage bet'!Deen the Seminary and the
Nunnerie~, as a matt,er of most public notoriety ; and
~etailed the dissolute lives of the priests, their habit-
ual gambling, intemperance, and profligacy, as well
as the licentiousness of the female convents of Mon-
treai; which Judge Moers said, were as open ma.tters
of talk at that period, in that city, just as much as
J~e most common affairs of life. Judge Moers also
rep~esented to me the prieits and nuns of Montreal,
from hj~ own personal acquaintance with them, in
exactly the same light and character, thirty~tlLree
years ago, as they have lately been exhibited before
the.Americ~n public. 1t1.1·. Stone, therefo~e, to rny
own certa1'n knowledge, ~ta,s published that which is
not true !' "
. lt appl;lars, from this stateme.nt, .that the existence
of an underground passage, between the Prie~ts'
Seminary ~~il the nunnery, has been a matter of con-
v~r~tJ~n for many years.

pany with different Christian brethren, I have also

period, during the completion of the cathedral in that

The following is the affidavit of Mr. Hogan, now
a respectable member of the Methodist church, of
New York, but formerly a Roman Catholic studenl
of the Seminary of Montreal :-
" New York, October 26, 183P
"Thomas Hogan, of the city of New York, being
duly affirmed, doth say : That in the year 1824, he
was a resident of the city of Montreal, Lower Can-
ada-that at that period, the existence of a subterra-
nean passage between the Seminary in Notre-Dame
street, and the Hotel Dieu convent, was a matter of
the most public notoriety ; and that he himself has
been in that passage, having entered it from the door
in the Seminary-and the said Hogan doth further
depose, that to his own personal knowledge, the Ro-
man priests were constantly in the practice of visiting
the nuns, for the purpose of licentious intercourse, by
that secret passage. THoMAS HoGAN.

"AoTtONs speak louder than words," is a maxim
as venerable for age, as it is just and true. Accord-
ing to this maxim, it is evident, that the conduct of
Miss Monk's opponents furnishes an argument of
great force against themselves, and, of course, in
support of her claims. The position, which they
have taken, that she is an impostor, and never has
been a nun, if true, could have been prond beyond
all doubt, with one-thousandth part of the labor,
which they have fruitlessly bestowed in their several
attempts to prove it. They admit thAt, until recently,
she has always lived in and about Montreal. Cou!d
they not then, with very little trouble, have shown us
where and with whom she lived, during the time sht
professes to have been a nun in the Hotel Dieu con-
vent1
But let us lcok at their conduct a little in the d•
taiL When Miss Monk visited Montreal in the
month of August, 1835, and there presented het
13
CONFIRMATION or
criminal charges against the priests and nuns, it was
denied that she had ever been a nun in the Hotel
Dieu nunnery. In proof that she had been an in-
mate of that con:v:ent, Miss. Mon)t offered to furnish
a description of its interior-its apartments, its pE'r-
sons, and their occupations, &c.-and urged the ex.:
amination of the nunnery, with a view to the appli-
cation of the proposed test. Certainly this was. fair
on her part. Why, then, d_
id not the priests ~omply
with the proposal? If she had· been an impostor,
what e;J,sjer and more ready mode of proving it, "
to the
satisfaction of all concerned, could they have desired 1
The reply often made, that she and her friends were
unworthy of their notice, and that the convent was a
sacred place, not to be inspected by men from toe
world, is not less insulting than it is untrue ; for-they
did notice .her, by collecting and publishing affidavits
against her; and men from_tl1e world, such. as they
have been pleased to select, have been admitted intQ
the .nunnery to inspe~t it. Does not their conduct.i~
this.particular betray guilt ?
A short time after Miss. Monk returned to New
York from MontreaJ, her opponents made an attempt to
prove an alibi-to show that she was e]sewhere than
in the convent, during the time in which s~e. declares
herself to have heen in that:establishment. They col-
lected and published six or. eight affidavits, the im-
port. and chal"acter of which is known to the pu~lic.
Five of them refer excht~ively to matters subsequent
to her arrival in Montreal. The other two are those
of Dr. Robertson and her mother, Mrs. Monk. Dr.
Robertson states, that on inquiry, he had ascertaine!l
that she -was at-t>ervice in Sorel and St. Denis, a por-

the nunnery ; and Mrs. Monk says, that s'ne :onck
told certain persons, that her dat!ghte'r had tiot ·been
in the ·nunnery. This is 'the amount 'of their te'sti:.
mony·; and, if Maria Monk had been 'an impostor,
can any man believe that the priests an'd their advo:.
cates, would have rested theil cau'se on a foun·dat'ion,
so unsubstantial as this 1 Does not the weakness o'C
their defence, show the unsoundness of their ·ca'usid
The next step ~Ol'thy of 'notice in the co'nduct o:
t
the priests, is the visit of father Phelan of Mo'nt'real
to New York, in order to decoy 'Mis·s Monk awar
from her friends in that city~ This was m the \'vi'n
ter of 1835~6. A detailed account of it may be se'en
in the first chapter of the pr'esent work by Miss Mo'nk.
As this priest came to New York in disguise, leavint
an impression in Montreal that he had gone to sp'end
a few weeks on Nuns' Island, it is presumed, that hi~
visit to this city will be denied. It can, however, ·b~
proved that he was in New York at the time ~pecift­
ed, and that the impression was made in Mobtreal
that he had gone to the Island. It has b'een publi~.h.:.
ed again and again, without being as yet contradict~
ed, from any responsible source. Why then should
that priest visit New York under such circums~ances,
unle.ss i~ were in som'' way to destroy Miss Monk';
testimony 1 He knew her feelings towards himself
as the father of her child ; and he knew ihat a spe;.
cial intimacy had been formed and cherishe~ betwe~ii
himself and her, during her residence in the .nunnery;
in a word, he knew that if a~1y nan could draw hiH
:
away from her friends in New Y ork, or induce her to
withhold her testimony, h~ was the n,av. Out of
regard to him, Miss Monk was perfec1.ly silent i'e•
specting his visit to New Y ork, until after the abduc-
ua cONFIRMATION OF
tion plot, during the following summer, had been de-
velop~d. It was, however, noticed by her friends,
_
that her feelings towards him, during this lapse of
lime, were different from what they were, prior to
this visit. Now if Miss Monk were an impostor, is
it supposable that this priest would have thus visited
her 1 And does not this visit stamp with the seal of
truth her claims as an ex-nun? What stronger evi-
dence can be demanded 1
In the present work by Miss Monk, will be found
an account of the attempt in May, 1836, to abduct her
away from New York. The principal facts in the case
are mentioned by her, in.her narrative of the attempt.
From personal knowledge, I know many of her state-
ments respecting this matter, to be true; and others
of them I believe on good authotity, to be equally
founded in truth. To mention particulars, such as
• know too be true, would occupy too much space.
fhey may. be seen in J.er narrative. My object at
present, is with the fact, that such an attempt was
made; and of this there can be no reasonable doubt
in the minds of such as are acquainted with the facts
in the case.
It is certain that several individuals were thus en-
gaged; and it is certain that some of them were Ca-
nadians. They were prowling about the neighbor-
hood for a number of days. They were seen again
and again, and her uncle, on the Sabbath specified by
Miss Monk, was overheard in conversation with her
respecting the matter.
The design of the plot was to induce Miss Monk,
voluntarily, to leave New York. The plot was well
formed, and well conducted; and would have· suc-
_
eeeded, had it not been thwarted by the uatiring vigi.

lance of Miss Monk's friends. Miss monk was corn.;.
pleiely deceiv~d by her uncle, until the time specified·
by her in her narrative of the affair, when a gentle_.
man called on her, and made known to her the true
nature and design of the plot. I was present at the
time when the gentleman called, and I regret that it is
not permitted me to mention, at present, particulars as
to the betrayal of one of the enemy, by \Vhich the ul-
timate object of the scheme was communica:ted to her.
Now they knew whether or not Miss Monk was an
impostor: on this point, they could not possibly be
mistaken. Would they then, be at so much trouble
and expense, to decoy away a known impostor?
The supposition is preposterous in the extreme. It
is ther~fore evident, that she is not an impostor.
The next attempt on the part of the priests to vin_.
dicate themselves, worthy of special consideration, is
to be found in their book, entitled, "Awful Expo-
sure." The contents of this book have been examined
in the first part of this work ; and it is believed, that
the candid reader is prepared to unite in pronouncing
the attempt to be an entire failure. Their object. has
been to destroy Miss Monk's testimony. To do this,
they have undertaken :-
1. Jn the first place, utterly to destroy her charac-
ter. They have attempted to prove that, besides be-
ing insane, she is a compound of all that is infamous
in the vilest of women. But in this, they have come
short. Their attempt only evinces the weakness of
their cause, and the infamy of their witnesses. Their
witnesses, as we have seen, are false witnesses, tes•
tifying in several instllnces, in direct opposition to
each other.
2. They have repeated their attempt to prove an
13•
CONFIRMATION OF
alibi-that at the tim~ she professes to have been m
the nunnery, she was living in Sorel, St. Denis, &c.
Here they have failed; and on what ground c:an their
failure be accounted for, unless it b~, the falseness !If
their position'l Is it possible rationally to conceive of
any other 'l If so, let it be made known.
3. Being themselves conscious of the incredibility
of their testimony to prove an alibi, they have en-
deavored to support it, by an exparte examination
of the nunnery. But this examination has only help-
ed to expose the unsoL:udness of their cause. We.
have seen, that the report of their professed architect
furnishes a high degrtJe of evidence of the fact, that
Miss Monk has, as corr('ctly as could have been ex-
pected, described the apartments of that portion of
the nunnery which she attempted to desCiibe. The
priests have, therefore, uttt:rly failed in this effort to
mislead and deceive the public. What, then, is the
consequence of their failure 1 Does it not prove them
to be false 1
4. But, as if sensible of the rottenness of their foun-
dation, they have, as a last desperate resort, taken
refuge in Mrs. McDonell's Magdalen Asylum.
Why should they go there, if they were satisfied with
the evidence which they had collected, to prove Miss
Monk to be an impostor1 They do not even pretend
that she wag ever there, prior to the time she profess-
es to have escaped from the convent. If they had
11atisfactorily proved to the world, that Miss ]\Ionk
did not obtain the facts, published in her book, from
a residence in the Hotel Dieu nunnery, why give
th~mselves any more trouble on the subject'l Ah,
they knew better ; they knew that she hau been a
nun, and they knew that they could not disprove it.

MARIA l\IONK'8 DlseLOSURES. 151
Respecting this movement ofthe priests, it is proper
to malte a few remarks, in order that its character
may the better be understood. The idea that Miss
Monk and her friends manufactured the " Awful Dis·
closures," from what she learned in the Asylum, is of
recent date. It was never head of in New York, sa
far as I can learn, until last summer, nearly a year
after she preferred her ~barges in Montreal, against
the priests. After this long period, they wish us to
believe that the conventual ceremonies, interior
apartments, and persons-themselves excepted, I sup-
pose, though they do not say so-described by Maria
Monk, are such as she saw in Mrs. McDonell's Asy-
lum. Miss Monk, in her book, speaking of her novi-
tiate state in the Hotel Dieu, mentions the names of
four novices, as also that of Jane Ray. The priests,
in order to carry forward their novel device, have fur-
nished us with five affidavits, from as many persons,
bearing the names mentioned by Miss Monk as in-
mates of the Hotel Dieu. These women are made
to testify that they were inmates of the Asylum at
the time Miss Monk was, and that she became ac-
quainted with them there. But who has ever seen
these individuals in the Asylum 1 A gentleman
from New York called there twice, but he could find
but one out of the five named, and she evidently had
never seen Maria Monk, for she described her as
having light hair, when in fact her hair is black.
Now, that this whole affair is a mere jesuitical de-
vice, designed to mislead the public, is not only mani-
fest from its intrinsic absurdity, but also from the fact,
that immediately after it was publicly announced, the
Asylum was said to be broken up and its inmates dis-
persed, because no more means could be obtained for

their support. How happens it that the t~treaml5'of
benevolence in Montreal should become dry ju~t at
that time '1 And how happens it, that if Maria Monk
has described the interior of Mrs. McDonell's estab-
lishment, it was not made known at an earlier date 'I
'\Vhy especially was it closed from inspection, a9
soon as the discovery was made 1 It does appear
that, if any thing can demonstrate the desperateness
of the priests' cause, it is this silly Magdalen trick
of theirs. I call it silly, for it does seem to evince a
degree of stupidity on the part of the priests, which
cannot be accounted for, unless it be on the principle,
that those whom the Almighty abandons to destruc-
tion for their vit~es, he often, in his providence, drives
to otherwise unaccountable folly and madness.
Th~s we have noticed the more prominent at-
tempts, which the priests have made to defend them-
selves from the charges preferred against them by
Maria Mot!k. Several minor attempts haVE been
passed over; such as their celebrated handbill, which
was so extensively circulated in New York and other
places, declaring that Miss Monk was a Protestant
girl, and had been living for four years with Mr. Hoyt;
and al"o their declaration, that her " book was a trans-
lation from an old Portuguese work;" and since then,
that it was not her production, but that of " certain in-
dividuals who had formed an atrocious plot against
the Clergy and Nuns of Lower Canada."
'What a mass of untruth and palpable contradic-
tions ! b the supposition possible, that the priests
arc innocent in this matter, when all their attempts
at self-defence have only served to sink them deeper
.and deepE>", in the bottomless abyss of falsehood and
infamy 1 One thi:1

able. It belies them in a manner that it is truly as·
tounding. With a voice that cannot be misunder·
stood, it proclaims them guilty.
In conclusion, I would seriously press the inquiry,
whether it is supposable, that, if the priests were in-
nocent they would have borne such a load of reproach
and infamy for so long a time, without having demon-
strated their innocency to the world. Especially when
it could have been done with so much ease, by pro-
ving Miss Monk to be an impostor, if she is an im-
postor as they maintain that she is. The belief of it
beggars credulity itself. The reply," they stand upon
their character," and that the "disclosures of Miss
Monk are unworthy of their notice," is as preposterous
as it is untrue. Stand upon their character!.Common
sense rebukes so gross an absurdity. The horrid
charges, preferred against them by Maria Monk, and
believed by thousands and tens of thousands to be
sober truth, "unworthy of their notice !" "Who can
believe this 1 If it be so, it may be asketl what i~ there
on earth, that can arrest their dignified attention1
Finally, it is manifest that the priests have utterly
failed, in every attemp~ they have made in their own
defence. What, thE'n, is the legitimate inference, from
this fact': Is it not, that they are guilty 1 That they
themselves are impostors, instead of Maria Monk's
being an impostor? In reason's name, it is asked, how
can it be otherwise 1 How can it be that they are in-
nocent, and that she is an impostor, when every thing
that speaks on the subject, proclaims the opposite to
be true. This is the voice-not only of her person,
character, conduct, narrative, of religion and nature,
and of the testimony of others-but it is also the
voice of every attempt '" hich they have made in self-
vindication.

the nun, at the confessional, must pour into the ear
of a man, the secret conflicts of her own breast, with
regard to this, very passion ; how, the priest ques-
tions; and how he may advise his fair penitent in se-
cret 1 Need I depict the voluntarily incurred temp-
tations to which both are exposed by·this most un-
n~tural intercf)urse? It can scarcely be otherwise,
than that crime should be the result. Both priests.
and nuns are kept from its commission by no human·

an assembly of youthful females, and then bind them, ,
not only with bolts and bars, but with the most sol-.
emn and superstitious vows and oaths, never more
to have any communication with the world? Why

I have never been able to find it. But I do find that
Christ was " to proclaim liberty to the captive11, ana
the openingofthejrri11on to them that are bound." Tho
voice of Christianity, therefore, is that the doors of
these female prison houses be opened, and that the
captives be set at liberty. Christianity is from hea-
ven. It came into the world, not to derange and
break up the institutions of man's social nature, but
to hallow and purify them. Did the God of nature
make woman for society, or to shut her up in a nun-
nery '1 Let the advocates of nunneries read the sec-
ond chapter of the first book in their Bibles, if they
have any; nnd they will learn that woman was made
for man, not to be shut up in prison. Revelation,
therefore, is against nunneries.
Reason still presses the inquiry, why should inof-
fensive and unsuspecting young ladies be decoyed
from the path of life, which Christianity prescribes,
and be intombed for life within thlil walls of a con-
vent '1 Young ladies, I say, for the priests will have
no others, unless it should be some who were very
rich, and received for the sake of their wealth. This
fact proves to a demonstration, that the object can-
not be of a religious character; for if it were, then
the aged and the infirm: who are now excluded,
would, of all others, be receive<!. I am aware of the
fact, that a religious profession is the bait, by which
young females are enticed, by the priests and their·
panders: into nunneries. They are made to believe
that the moment they enter a convent, they are
thenceforth removed from all worldly temptation
and are, during the remainder of their lives, to be
devoted exclusively to the holy duties of religion:

teshmony of eloped nuns, and others, but from the
above-named fact, viz., that the aged and infirm, to
whom such retirement and religious employment ·
might possiblj be desirable, are the very persons
who are excluded.
Nor can the object be for purposes of charity, such
as educating poor children, and nursing the sick. I
am aware that the latter is connected with the Hotel
Dieu-that there is a fine hospital there, and that
many of the sick have reaped essential benefit from
it. But, I ask, what necessary connexi01-. ~here is
between this charity, and the imprisonment, for life,
of scores of young and tender females 1 Cannot the
sick be taken care of, without doing such violence to
~he laws, both of God and nature 'I The sick are
nursed, and the poor are educated, to say the least,
among Protestants, who have no occasion for nun-
neries, as well as they are among Cathu.~cs. The ·
~ruth is, this charity business is a mere outward garb
-fair to appearance, like a "whited sepulchre"-
designed, in connexion with a " religious profes-
sion," to conceal from the public eye the real object
which the pricsis have in view, in sustaining clois-
tered convents. Roman priests are required by their·
:religion, habitually to violate a primary law of the
human constitution, in being required to live a life
">fcelibacy. But nature protests against the requi-
i!ition, and determines on seeking relief from some
other source. But concealment is requisite, in order
to give external consistency to their professions of
chastity. How then can gratification and conceal-
ment be secured 'I A cloistered nunnery, under the
colors· of peculiar san~tity and charity, presents it-
!'elf a!! afrording both the requisites. Concealment,
14
15A CONFIRMATION OP
however, requires something more thnn the most ·
arrant deceit and hypocrisy. Children and ref't'ac·
tory nuns must be disposed of; and' to secure this,
habitual. murder is necessary; as well ns a system or
the most severe and tyrannical discipline. Sin, in
its progress, being downward, where will it· stop 'I
What bounds can you set to it, when unbridled as in
a convent, concealed from the public eye 1 Tho
Hotel Dieu is of long standing, and has grown ripu •
in iniquity. Hence but a small portion of its diabol
ical abominations can be disclosed by Maria Monk
to the world. There are others which ought not to ·
be "once named as becometh saints."
It seems, then, that the real object of cloistered
nunner,ies is, so far as they respect the priests, their
own licentious gratification. Now I do not say that
this was their original intention. I think it was not.
But they soon degenerated into it. Hence the ulti- ·
mate design of the scores of .~ncipient nunneries in
these United States. Oh, that they were rightly un·
derstood by mothers and by daughters! Then we
should•hear of no more taking the veil.
The conclusion, therefore, of the whole matter un-
der this·head is·this,-That the disclosures of Maria
Monk are just what might rationally be expected,
from the nature -of. the case; from priestly celibacy
in conncxion with cloistered females. How futile,
then, is,the.followingquestion of the priests: "Now

S DISCLOSURES. 169
Defore closing this chapter, perhaps something
should be said, respecting the order of " sisters of
charity," as they are .called. These females have,
no doubt, done much to mitigate the sufferings of
the sick and destitute:; as :also to :impart papaliin-
struction to poor chihlrcn. This is natural to the
kind and sympathizing nature of the female sex.
Dut does this argue any thing in favor of this order
of women, who are required to live in a state 'Ofce-
,libacy 1 .Arc these amiable .female qualities confined
to this mode of life 'I .Must woman live a single life
in order to be kind and geneTous to the needy and
.the helpless 1 ·
But the question is, what is the object of the priests
in having these unmarried women clus~red about
them, as they always have, especially in the absence
of cloistered nunneries 1 Let Miss Monk's narrative
in the subsequent pages, respecting the Black Nuns'
Island, answer the question. It would seem that the
object of the priests, with reference to this order of
females, was substantially the same with that of con-
vents. Let, then, the lovers of good order and chas-
tity frown upon this order of women, until it shall
be broken up, together with conYents. And· let
young women avoid this vow of celibacy, as they
would avoid impurity and wretchedness. It is death
to all that is lovely in the female character.

THERE are two things, in the disclosures of Maria
Monk, which render them comparatively incredible
to the American community. First, the enormity
of the crimes which she declares are perpetrated in
the Hotel Dieu nunnery of Montreal; and, in the
second place, the cool-hearted manner in which
they are said to be habitually practised in that es-
tablishment. This objection, so frequently urged
against the truth of Mi~s Monk's narrative, arises
from two sources ;-lst, the cor11parative purity of
the american people :-and 2d, the want of historic
information respecting the character of the Roman
priesthood, in all former ages. The latter of these
is the more prominent obstacle in the way of gaining
ful! confidence in the truth of her statements.

in popish history, as also those who have s~
journed somewhat extensively in popish countries,
find nc difficulty in believing the "Awful Disclo-
sures" to be substaniially true. Hence, too, the fact,
that gentlemen of extensive observation, who have
been reared in Catholic countries, amidst the vices
of Roman priests, not unfrequently ridicule the in•
credulity of the American people, in reference to
this matter.
Roman Catholics glory in the infallibility of their
church; and, of course, its immutability. .It is,
say they, the one church of Christ, the same in
every age and in every country. The author of
these pages is aware of the fact, that when the con-
sequences of this principle are pressed upon the ad-
vocates of popery, they P
.ttempt to evade them by
eome Jesuitical prank or other. Still, it is true, if the
tree is one and the same in all ages and in all climed,
its fruit must be substantially the same, under all
circumstances. Thus, in regard to the spirit of po-
pery, it is one and the same the world over, and in
every age; and bears substantially the same fruit,
wherever it is allowed to arrive to full maturity.
Now, what is this spirit, as exhibited on the impar-
tial page of history 1 Does it contradict the reign-
ing s!_)irit of the Montreal cloistered convent, as il-
lustrated by the disclosures of Maria Monk 1 Are
the crimes which are divulged by her, such as mur..
der, hypocrisy, and the most unblushing licentious-
ness, novel things in the history of popery ? or are
they such as naturally fall in with that hi~tory? If
the pages of Roman Catholic history could be made
honestly to oppose the statements of Maria Monk,
the controversy would assume altogether a different
14*
162 CONFlR!\IATIO:q OF
aspect from what it now wears. Dut they cannot.
Truth is immutable, however much it may be falsi-
fied and glossed over. A few statements and ex-
tracts from well authenticated history will be suffi-
cient to show, not only that Maria :Monk's narratilo
is no libel on the Roman priests, but also to confirm
its trutl:, so far as the history of the past can do it.
And here I wish to be as brief as fidelity to the
cause of truth and humanity will admit of, for the
subject is painful to every virtuous mind.
1. In respect to the crime of murder.
Perhaps no subject more perfectly illustrates the
murderous spirit of Roman priests, in past ages,
than the "Holy Inquisition," as papists call it. This
"infernal tribunal" originated with the priests--it
was introduced into every country into which the~
had the power of introducing it-and by them it
was sustained, as long as thev had the oower of sus-
taining it. For cruelty, It stanas Witnout a rival on
earth, and, I hope, also in the dark domains of Sa-
tan below. Thank God, that humanity and the Pro-
testant religion have nearly banished it from the
earth, although its dreadful spirit still remains with
those who originated and sustained it. The object
of the inquisition is the destruction of "damnable
heresy,'' by torturing, in the most cruel manner, even
unto death, all such as dare to think and believe con-
trary to the wishes of the church; that is, the priest·
hood, from the pope downward, for such is the
meaning of the word church among Roman Catho-
lics. In Spain alone, its victims, according to the
estimate of Llorente, from 1481 to 1808, amounted
to 341,021. Of these 31,912 were burned, 17,659
wer.:l burned in effigy, and 291;456 were subjected

to severe penance. Here, then, were nearly 32,000
men and women burned to death, after suffering im-
prisonment, and a variety of tortures, simply tor re-
sisting the will of the priesthood. What is this but
the most cold-blooded murder 1 It is vain for the
friends of popery to attempt to blunt the edge of
these facts, by saying that they occurred in the dark
ages. Are not all ages dark where popery reigns 'l
And are not papists loud in their denunciation of
the reformation, by which the darkness that covered
Christendom was, in some measure, dissipated 1
Besides, what pope; cardinal, bishop, or priest, has
ever been known to utter a sentence of condemna-
tion against their " most holy inquisition 1" What,
condemn an institution which for ages had..the sanc-
tion of an infallible church! No, never. They will
soonel' defend it, as bishops England and Hughes
have had the hardihood to do, the one in Baltimore
and the other in Philadelphia.
The m~:~.nner in which the Pope and his court re-
ceived the intel1igence of the barbarOllS massacre
of the Protestants in France, commencing on the
eve of St. Bartholomew's day, in A. D. 1572,
is another instance which shows the mmderous
spirit of the priesthood. Perhaps the page of his-
tory does not contain a darker spot than this. The
principal Protestants of the kingdom were invited
to Paris, under a solemn oath of protection from
Charles IX., a papist, to attend the marriage of the
king's sister. They attended the wedding, and thus
fell into the snare that had been spread for their de-
struction. The design of the papists was to destroy
every Protestant in France, and they came wcllnigh.
accomplishing their m.<efariou~ project. Some ten
1~ CONFIRMATION OF
t~pu~anu were inhumanly butchered in the single
city of Paris, while the work of death was carried
.on in almost every part of the empire, until from
30,000 to 100,000 Protestants were slain.
And now, reader, how do you suppose the intelli-
g~nce of this dreadful slaughter was received at
Rome? Did the pope condemn the king for the
double crime of breaking his oath and murdering
h~s subjects? Did he grieve because so mllny hu-
man beings had been so fiendishly butchered? No,
reader. It was to him and hi!> court "gl:1d tidings
of great joy." The following is extracted from
"Duck's Theological Dictionary."-" When the let-
ters of the pope's legate were read in the assembly
of the cardinals, by which he assured the pope that
all was transacted by the express will and command
of the king, it was immediately decreed that the
pope should march with his cardinals to the churcll
of St. Mark, and in the most solemn manner give
thanks to God for so great a blessing conferred on
the See of Rome, and the Christian world; and that,
on the Monday after, solemn mass should be cele-
brated in the church of Minerva, at which the pope,
Gregory XIII., and cardinals were presen~; and tha~
a ,jubilee should be published throughout the whole
Christian world, and the cause of it declared to be,
to return thanks to God for the extirpation of the
enemies of the truth and church in France. In the
evening, the cannon of St. Angelo were fired to tes-
tify the public joy; the whole city illuminated with
bonfires; and no one sign of rejoicing omitted that
was usually made for the greatest victories obtained
iu favor of the Roman church!!!" Alas! what spirit
is lwre ? Is it thut of the compassionate Saviour 1

or that of Satan, " who was a murderer from tnt
beginning?"
Once more, and I have done on the crime of m~
der.
"Pope Gregory, drawing his fishpond, found more
than six thousand heads of infants in it; upon which
he deeply repented, and, confessing that the decree
of unnatural celibacy was the cause of so horrid a
slaughter, he condemned it, adding: 'It is better to
marry than to give occasion of death.' "-Hulderic
Epist. adv. constit. de Cleric. Celib.
Were it not a tax upon the reader's patience, I
would here add a few extracts from standard Roman
Catholic writers on morals, teaching the lawfulness
of murder for a variety of frivolous reasons. such as
might easily be offered by priests and nuns, in justi-
fication of the murders committed by them. But I
forbear. See Awf. Dis. p. 355.
Respecting the licentious character of the Romish
priesthood, but little need be said. If ever the gold-
en mean should be observed on any subject, it
should be on this. The subject is disgusting, and
requires a skilful pen so to manage it as not not to pro-
mote rather than destroy its practice. There is,
however, a fastidiousness about it which is contrary
both to scripture and sound reason. This vice, like
every other, in order to destroy it, must be exposed
to some extent. Nothing can be more pleasing to
the priests than the senseless clamors which are
raised against the suppl Jed licentious tendency of
Maria Monk's disclosures. None are louder on this
point than themselves. They are like the thief, who
is first to cry, stop thief! stop thief! Herein Satan

comes the staunchest advocate of chastity. Sec that
Canadian priest, so chaste that he cannot even shake
hands with his own mother, lest he should receive
pollution from the touch of woman! What hypoc-
l'isy!
It would seem, really, as if some of our newspa-
per editors had been under the tuition of the priests
on this subject. Such moralists, while they a,·oid

ter of Roman priests and convents must be known
before they can recciYc that treatment which of
right belongs to them. Ah ! how many thousands
of unsuspecting and virtuous young ladies have been
ruined for ever, for the want of just that knowledge
which is to be found in Maria Monk's disclosures!
And yet, how strange that guod men should be so
inconsiderate as to unite with profligate priests and
others in the only cry which can pnvent its diffu-
sion among the people.
I will here givc an extract from Da Costa, a Por-
tuguese Roman Catholic writer, who had suffered in
the Inquisition, in consequence of being accused of
Freemasonry. It illustrates the adulterous charac-
ter of Roman priests, as also the abominable char-
acter of the Confessional. Pope Paul IV., from some
cause or other, was induced to issue a bull, ordering
an investigation into the crime of solicitant, as it is
called-that is, when the confessional is used by the
priests for licentious purposes. This had reference
to the kingdom of Spain. The following is an ex-
tract from the bull:-" ·whereas certain ecclesiastics

the confessions of such penitents, have broken out
into such heinous acts of iniquity, as to abuse the
sacrament of penance in the very act of hearing the
confessions, not fearing to injure the same sncrn-
ment, and him who instituted it, our Lord God and
Saviour Jesus Christ, by enticing and provoking, or
trying to entice and provoke females to lewd actions
at the very time when they were making their con-
fessions."
" When this hull," says Da Co!'lta, " was first in-
troduced into Spain, the inquisitors pubhs!led a H
ol-
emn ediet in nil the churches belonging to the arch-
bishopric of Seville, that any person knowing, or
having heard of any friar or clergyman's having
committed the crime of abusing the Sacrnment of
Confession, or in any manner having imiiroperly
conducted himself during the confession of a female
penitent, should make a discovery of what he knew,
within thirty days, to the holy tribunal; and very
heavy censures were attached to those who should
neglect or despise this injunction. W hen this edict
was first published, such a considerable number of
females went to the palace of the Inquisition, only·
in the city of Seville, to reveal the conduct of their
infamous confessors, that twenty notaries, and as
many inquisitors, were appointed to minute down
their several informations against them; but these
being found insufficient to receive the depositions 1
of. so many witnesses; and the inquisitors being
thus overwhelmed, as it \Vere, with the pressure of·
such affairs, thirt~days more were allowed for ta-
king the accusations, and this lapse of time also pro-
ving inadequate to the intended purpose, a similar :
period was granted, not only for a third but a f~urth ,
168 CONFIRMATION OF
time. The ladies of rank, character, and noble fam-
ilies, had a difficult part to act ou this occasion, as
their discoveries could not be made of any particu-
lar time and place. On one side, a religious fear of
incurring the threatened censures, goaded their con-
sciences so much as to compel them to make the
required accusations; on the other side, a regard to
their husbands, to whom they justly feared to give
offence, by affording them any motives for suspecting
their private conduct, induced them to keep at home.
'I'o obviate these difficulties, they had recourse to the
measure of covering their faces with a veil, accord-.
ing to the fashion of Spain, and thus went to the in-
quisitors in the most secret manner they could adopt.
Very few, however, escaped the vigilance of their
husbands, who, on being informed of the discoveries
and accusations made by their wives, were filled
with suspicions; 11nd yet, notwithstanding this ac-
cumulation of proofs against the confessors, produ-
ced to the inquisitors, this holy tribunal, contrary to
the expectations of every one, put an end to the
business, by ordering, that all crimes of this nature,
proved by lawful evidence, should from thenceforth
be consigned to perpetual silence and oblivion."-

sure" have the brazen impudence to make the
following declaration, on page 56 of their book.
"Now the priests of Montreal and of Canada, do
enjoy, at least, public esteem for morality, and if
necessary, the testimony of every adult in the
province would be gladly yielded to their excellent
character." The father of lies could not fabricate
a purer untruth than this.*
I have taken some pains to inquire of gentlemen
from Canada, respecting the moral character of the
priests, out of the nunneries, and the result of my
inquiries is, that it would be doing them no injus-
tice to apply to them the above picture given of
their brethren, the priests of Spain. I could men-
tion names and particulars, if it were deemed advi-
sable. I will mention the name of one "aault," in
whose good opinion the friends o the nunnery
nppear to place much confidence. The gentleman
alluded to, i::~ the Rev. G. W. Perkins of Montreal.
In a letter, dated March 18, 1836, speaking of the
conyeut, he says:-" Now that fornication is com-
mitted, there is no reasonable question;" that is, in
the nunnery.t
• A Canadian, speaking of the intemper11nce of the priests
says-" that he had known a party of priests, with Bishop
Lartigue at their head, hold a convivial meeting in his village
on Saturday, and carry their revels so far that no one was til
to say mass on the following Sabbath."
t The foilowing is the testimony of one of Rome's best popes,
extracted from Baxter's Jesuit Juggling, page 219. "Pius II
was one of the best that the Papal seat a long time had; and
yet in his epistle to his father, Epist. 15, who was angry with him
for fornication, he saith: 'You say you are sorry for my crime,
I know not what opinion you have of me. You know what
you were yourself. Nor am I an hypocrite, that I should desire
lather to seem good, than to be good. It is an ancient and

170 CONFIRMATION OF
According to the above picture, what is the con-'
fessional1 Beyond all question, one of its grand
objects is to secure female victims for the impure
indulgence ofthe priests. Its history affords pain-
ful evidence of the trllth of this declaration ; and
were it properly understood, no virtuous family
would ever allow its female members to visit it, any
sooner than they would allow them to visit a
brothel.
For the truth of the following statement of facts,
I holJ myself responsible. A Catholic young wom-
an, ardently devoted to her religion, by the name of
Miss N--, lived in the family of Mr. M--, in New
York. In her appearance she was quite prepos-
scssin~, and probably of virtuous character, up to
the time to which this narrative refers. A short
time before good-Friday, which was the first day
of last April, she was observed to be uncommonly
devoted to the ceremonies of her church. About·
this time, she said to a young lady of the family,
"My father Confessor is a going to bestow upon me
a wonderful gift, about next good-Friday, if I am
faithful to go frequently to confession, and confess
all my sins, and answer all the questions which he
asks me." "What is it, a new gown?" replied the
lady. "Oh, no, not a carnal gift, but a spiritual one ;
I am to be exalted, and to be made a spii itual sister." ;
usual sin. I know not who is without it. This plague is..
spread far nnd near; though I see it not, seeing nature, which..
doth nothing amiss, hath bred this appetite in all living crea-
tures, tlJat mankind should be continued.' He who was the
glory of the Papacy, knew none of the Hierarchy without this ·
beastly sin."-No man, acquainted with the Romish priest- .

Miss N. increased her visits to 1the confessional,
going more frequently as the time ofhcr e:r:altation
' drew ncar. At length the time arrived. Miss N.
was to go to confess at that time in the evening.
She went, but did not return until early the next
morning. Sad disappoiutment and shame were de-
picted on her countenance. 'fo the question, asking
~er where she had passed the night, she declined
,giving a direct answer. On one occasion she said,
that she staid in the church all night; but then it
shouid :be known that the house of her father Con-
f~ssor was in the immediate neighborhood of the
church. Miss N remained in the family of Mr. M.
but a few days after this.
I leave my readers to make their own inferences.
Dut I would ask, if it be not the duty of the friends
of virt~1e and good order, to discountenance a prac-
tice so corrupting and so ruinous to all that is virtu-
ous in the female character, as is that of confession
to a corrupt priest. Destroy the confessional, and
you at once destroy that fatal power, which .the
-priests now have over their deluded followers; and
until this is done, all your efforts to enlighten and
elevate Catholics, will be thwarted by t}:lese enemie~
of the human race. Let, then, every lawful means
be used to accomplish this end, remembering that
·it is at the confessional those chains are forged, ap-
plied, and riveted, which hold in bondage so large
a portion of the human family ; a bondage more
dreadful than that of the African slave, because it Is
the bondage of the soul, which God made in his own
glorious image.
I will now furnish my readers with a few extracts
from a standard Cutholic author, for the purpose of

his memoir~. And it should be borne in mind, that
these disclo~-;ures were made by this Homnn prelate,
not in the d:u·k nges, but some fot·ty or fifty years
ago. And it should also be borne in mind, that
Scipio de Uicci wns not a Protcstnnt or an enemy ·
to convents, but n friend to the latter, and a stnunch
Catholic. And it should be remembered nlso, that
this p~clnte, not having been connedcd with con-
vents, knew nothing of them, sal'c what he learned
by report, and in his attempts to reform them;
when, instead of the inmates being inclined to di-
vulge their own infiuny, they were doubtless dis-
posed, out of regard to themselves, to conceal their
deeds of darkness. Dut the case with Maria Monk
is very different. She was an inmate of the convent
for years, where she had every opportunity of wit··
ncssing its abominations. Dut my readers will see
enough, in all conscience, to confirm Maria Monk's
statements, in the subjoined extracts :-
"The Dominican Monks, who were members of
one of the l .•vst numerous ecclesiastical orders, had
been the scandal of all Italy, during one hundred and
fifty years, for th ~ :r total corruption: and their di-

A llindoo brahmin, having become a Catholic
priest, says : " The Uomau priests in ludia arc like
the bonzes of Jnpa11. The nuns arc the diMciplcs of
Diana, and their nunneries arc seraglios for the
monks. They were more often pregnant than mar-
ried women in general. The Jesuits had become
brahmins, in order to enjoy the privileges of thllt
caste; ~mong which were exemption from death
for cri~c; ~nd the right of enjoying the favors of
every woman who pleased them, it being commonly
received, that a brahmin priest sanctifies the woman
whom he honors with his attcntions."-Vol. ii. pages
216, 217.
"The monks, confessors of the convents, openly
taught the Tuscany nuns atheism; encouraged the
mo~t disgraceful libcrtinism; and filled them with
imiJurity, s.acrilege, and debauchery of the foulest
kinds. Immorality was thus added to profanation;
a;td corruption brought forth impiety. By tolera-

indulgence of them; and by encouraging the com-
mission of those iniquities, ht!l llecame an accom·

" The false or forged virtues of the monks and
nuns, are but a tissue of hypocrisy, and a stimulant
to the most odious vices. The institutions called
Virginales, were schools of corruption and licen-
tiousness: and the soi-disant tribunul of penitence
is the constant source of infamous wickedness, by
those k ;pudent jugglers, whose authority depends
on the blindness of mau. The monks, the nuns,
their superiors, and even the pope himself, not only
tolerated these disorders, but took no measures to
arrest the infidelity and impiety of those who were
daily adding new victims to 1heir atheism and in-
ordinate voluptuousness."-Vol. ii. pages 276, 277.
But enough ofsuch filth; for it is filth of th3 dark-

the cause 11f humanity, virtue, and reHgion, demand
it, for the same reason that the Son of God divested
the ancient scribes and Pharisees, the embryo pro-
totypes of Hamish priests, of their hypoc:itical
robes, and thus enabled the people to see that they
were "FULL OF DEAD MEN'S BONES, AND OF ALL UN•
CLE}.NNEss."-Matt. xxiii. 27. The Saviour knew
that there was no other way to destroy the supersti-
tious veneration whh which the Jews regarded their
priests, just as the Catholics, only in a much highe1·
degree, regard theirs. The naming of such vices,
should be regarded as an evil, the object of which
is the removal of a much greater one; just in the
sense in which many a Jl1edical prescription is an
evil, absolutely necessary, however, to 1:e adminis-
tered, in order to remove disease, and secure health.

condemn the "healing art," because unskilful men
abuse it.
Before leaving this subject, I wish to add a single
remark further. And that is this: That all the vices
spoken of by Maria Monk as practised in the Hotel
Dieu, (yea, and more too,) are abundantly inculcated
by the standard writers on morals of the order of
Jesuits. Ifany man wishes proof cf this assertion,
I would refer him, among others, to Paschal's Pro-
vincial letters, a work of undying celebrity. Pas-
chal was himself a Roman Catholic, but opposed to
the Jesuits.
According to these moralists, a priest may com-
mit le\vdness on the ground of self-gratification;
and then on the ground of self-defence1 or defend-
ing his reputation, he may lawfully murder, deceive,
lie, and swear falsely, or employ others to do the
same for him. I know that these principles are hor-
rid beyond conception. But they ~re true ; and I
lwld myself pledged to prove them, giving chapter
and verse, if the priests, in any responsible manner,
have the audacity to deny them.
Who, then, after reading the preceding part of
this chapter, can· seriously question the general
truth of Maria Monk's statements respeeting the
character of the Canadian priests and nuns 1 Espe-
cially when it is recollected, that a large portion of
these ·priests are foreign Jesuits, expellerl from for-
eign countries, as an order of men too infamous to
be tolerated by civil governments. They have been
expeJled, as an order of men, from almost every
country in Europe, by Catholic as well as Protest-
ant governments. Hence they come in swarms to
the North American continent, bringing along witb
178 CONFIRMATION, ETC.
them their ill-gotten gain, by which they build col':'
leges, churches, nunneries, &c. The "disclosures"
of Miss Monk, therefore, are unquestionably true,
and they would be substantially true, even if it
should he proved that she had never been a n~n in
the Hotel Dieu. This i!:! the opinion of the mass of
the Protestant people in Canada. It is to be hoped,
therefore, that the testimony of Maria Monk will no
more be disbelieved on the ground that she disclo-
ses practices so abominable, as to cause virtue to
hide its blushing face at the very mention of them.
In conclusion, I will mention two facts, which
ought not to be forgotten. lst. A large number of
the Canadian priests are Jesuits, from France : and
2d. The .fact that when Bonaparte broke up the con-
vents in France, bones of murdered infants were
found in great abundance. Can it then be supposed,
that the French Jesuits are any better in Canada,
than they were in France 1

CONCLUSION.
WHAT then is the result of the whole matter 1 We
have, in the first place, examined the "Awful Ex-
posure," published in defence of the Canadian priests
and nuns; and have found it to be an entire failure;
nay, we have found it to furnish strong eVIdence, in
<'Onfirmation of Miss Monk's claims to public confi-
dence. Thus also in reference to every attempt made
by them, for the same object. We have, in the iec-
ond place, briefly noticed the principal arguments in
support of Miss Monk's claims to our confidence, as
an ex-nun, dertved from a consideration of her in-
capacity to have acted the part of an impostor-of her
minute and extensive nunnery knowledge-of her
comparative ignorance of other matters-of the marks
on her person, produced by the infliction of penance
and nunnery violence-of the forlorn condition in
which she was first discovered in New York-of her
!-1upposed dying penitential confession to the Rev.
Mr. Tappin-of her consistent conduct with the de-
mands of her supposed truth-of the internal evidence
of her book-of the moral impress, stamped on her
mind-of the testimony of others, direct and indirect
-of the failure of her opponents in th 'lr Vdried at-
tempts of self-defence-of revelaticn, reason, and na-
ture-of the past history of the R oman priesthood
and convents. And now, I reitel"'!e the question,
what is the conclusion 1 Is there a particle of ground
for suspense 1 If so, what i i; it? Is there a single
position, taken by her opponer.!s •
.mswcpt away 1 If
so, let it be named.
B•Jt, perhaps, some •.vill say , after dl, there Hi a pos·
sibilitl of her being false, of hP.r h:: in~ an impostor,
and o course, of the prie,;lt:; and r:•ms being innocent
178 CONIJLU!!ION.
of the crimes charged upon them. Yes ; there is a
possibility in the case; and so there is a possibility
of her heing changed into a "pillar of salt." Bu!
is there any probability of it 7 The ground of ration-
al conclusiOns, is not possibilities, ~ut probabilities.
When ~entlemen, in' their reasonings, substitute the
former m place of the latter, they place themselves
beyond the limits of reason.
With reasonable men the case is different. It i3
believed ,that the foregoing arguments are sufficient
to establis~ them in the 'belief, that Maria ~onk is
not an impostor,' but is truly what she professes to be,
and that she has told substantially the truth, respect-
ing the nunnery. Such will readily perceive the im-
portance of the " Awful Disclosures," as a means for
opposing ~he conventual system, as also the spread of
popery.·
Let Protestants, then, act reasonably in appropri-
ately using them for these objects. Let them remem-
ber the deplorable state of more than one half of
Christendom, in consequence of popery. Let them
look at wretched starving Ireland. Let them behold
bleeding and distracted Spain, as well as South
America. Let them consider the ignorance, poverty,
and oppression, of papal countries in general. Let
them call to mind the condition of Canada; a vast
majority of whose inhabitants are so ignorant, as to
be incapable of either reading or writing their names.
T hey are sunk not only in ignorance, but in vice.
Intemperance abcnnds to a fearful extent, the priests,
their spiritual guides, setting them the example. Let
the American people especially, open their eyes upon
their own beloved country, and see with what rapid
strides, popery has been spreading itself, for a few
years past, over the length and breadth of the land.
Let them count the number of its churches, mass-
housesi convents, colleges1 academies, and new!>pa-
pers, a I devoted to the dissemination of a religion
which is fundamentally hostile to every thing that is
truly American. Let them count the number of its
-devotees, all o~ them marshalled and kept in the most

Before closing, I wish to offer a smgle remark re-
specting the following work of Miss Monk. It has
been written by the same worthy gentleman that
penned her first volume ; and great care has been ex·
ercised in writing it, to give to the community nothing
but the simple statements of the authoress. The
subject matter is hers. With reference to this point,
I speak with the more confiden<"e, from the fact, that
it has been written, since she came to t·eside with the
people of my pastoral charge.
And now, in conclusion, I would guard the public
against being misled by the deceptive arts of Roman
prie! •s. They undoubtedly will do something forth-
with for the purpose of weakening the impression,
which the following "Disclosures" are adapted to
make. Tl1ey will be ready perhaps, to swear that they
are a translation from some old Portuguese work ;
or that there never was such 9 priest as the murdered
L'Esperance ; or that there is no such place as the
Island described ; or, perhaps, it being in the dead of
the winter, when a visit to Canada and such an ex·
amination of the nunneries, subterranean passages,
Seminary, and the Black Nuns' Island, as has been
proposed to make, would be attended with extreme
difficulty, they may possibly offer a compliance with
the conditions, specified by the meeting, held in New
York, in' August, 1836. A bewildering flourish of
some sort or other will unquestionably be made ; but
it is hoped that the community will remember the
deceptive tricks heretofore prnnis.~J on them by the
priests, and that all further ones w~ll be disregarded.
PREFACE
TnE following pnges contain disclosures
relating to various persons and scenes, many
of which were not alluded to in my former
volume. Some of these facts I did not consider
important ; and of others I felt a strong reluc-
tance to speak. I have at length come to the
conclusion to add thus much to the facts I have
laid before the American public, under a belief
that it is likely to prove useful.
Since the greater part of the following pages
were prepared for the press, my character and
the truth of my book have been strongly at
tacked by several persons. I do not entertain
any unkind feelings towards such as may be
honest in opposing me, nor do I fear the result ;
for I know I am speaking the truth, and they
will soon become convinced, and acknowledge
their error.
I 1
-:ave only to offer to my opponents the
following chapters, in which they will find
more facts to meet, new _
scenes and personages
to explain or justify. If they should accuse
me of deriving these also from the Montreal
Magdalen Asylum, I hope they will not keep
the place closed, nor disperse or conceal the
inmates, as they have done since they publish-
ed such a charge against the " Awful Disclo-
sures."

CHAPTER I.
DleeouragementtJ and DifficultietJ attending the first Publication
my Book.
I HAVE had various trials to undergo since my
escape from the Nunnery, many of which I havo
particularly stated in the sequel of my NarJ;ative,
which is contained in the last editions of my "Aw·
ful Disclosures." Other trials, however, have been
my portion, some of which may have arisen in part
from my want of acquaintance with the world, a.nd
• others from the peculiar situation in which I was
placed, among persons as ignorant of me, as I was
of them. I have met with none, or at most but very
few indeed, who were at first prepared to believe my
story ; and some have long remained incredulous,
at least in part. The doubts expressed by respect·
able persons around me, have often given me ex-
trepte pain: for they always intimated want of con·
fidence in me. '
16
2 ATTEJIPT8 TO ABDeOT
Besides, I have !:ldmetimes had to feel very keen- 1 ·
ly the effects·o{ my self-conviction;. for, in more a I
than one instance, I have heard disparaging re- Fa
marks thrown out 'by the inconsiderate or unfeeling. me
Perhaps it is not to be wondered at, then, in spite of an
the resolution I had formed, of making known the
my experiblice to the w·orld, if I 'should have felt, s1~
at some periods, a desire for retirement and tran· cu
quillity, in some 'pllice, no inatter how humble, tha
where I might be free from trials like these. 1m
At a period a little preceding the publication of thr
the first edition of my book, I was much disquieted str1
by the circumstances in which I found myself. I to J
felt extremely uncertain what reception a\vaitcd irie, J
and supposed that in case public incredulity should t)le
render the ·sale·of my book very small, !'should be disl
involved in heavy pecuniary responsibilities, With- the
out the remotest hope of deliverance. What ·ihe ~~
laws of the country might condemn me to, "
in such 'Wal
a case, I knew not; but I sometimes apprehended mil
they might be severe. say
Now, while I was in s~ch ·a state of mind, I reo • . post
ceived a letter, which excited my curiosity in im spol
uncommon degree. I had directed the penny-post corn
to bring to my lodgings any letters addressed ·to keej
me, because several intended for my 'hands, had ~y~
been lying a long time in the Post-office. He left V
one for me one day, dated in New York, written in fron
Canadi1:1n style, half French and half English, and mali
signed F. P., which I, of course, understood for the at le
initials of F ather Phelan, the father o{mv ~hiict. to (II

l presumed, nt the firs~ aight, t4at the l~er Ip~st be
a forged one, for I co~\q . not p~{suade my~elf that
Fa,.ther Phelan would.visit New York, at so incle-
ment a season, or that he would invite Dle to hold
~n interview with him. Yet, on the other hand,
the style and language of tl!e letter, as well as the
signatur~, reminded me strongly of hi~; and my
curiosity was excited, to discover who it could be,
that had made so good an imitation. The letter
invited me to go, between the hours of two and
three, to the cort}er of Franklin Square and Ferry
street, as the writer .had something important to say
to me.
I thought there could be no danger in going
t)lere, to see who the impostor might be.; and the
distance being short from my lodgings, ~!though
the weather was bad, I went. Near the comer 1
saw a man, whpm I irom~diately recognised. It
was Father Phelan; and he accosted me with
mildness, told me he had something of ir;nportance to
say to me, but wished to avoid obs~rvation, and .pro·
. posed that I should go somewhere to a more retired
spot. Without much reflection, I consented io ac-
company him, making a resolution, however, to
Iceep on my guard, feeling some dread of placing
~yself in his power. · ·
We proceeded to a very considerable distance
from the place of meeting, he asking questions, end
making remarks about my Disclosures, &c. ; and
at length he pointed at a house, which he proposed
to ~nter, thnt we might converse. at leisure. I, how·

ever, pomted at another, which had a shop, and
looked something like an inn, and told him] would
not object to entering 'there. He consented; and
we seated ourselves in a room which was shown
us, I telling him, that I would not trust myself in his
power, as I had reason to fear the consequences, but
that in that place I was not afraid of him. He spoke
as if disposed to quiet my apprehensions ; and then
entered into a long.conversation, in which he show·
ed that he was well acquainted with the contents of
the affidavit I made in Montreal, in August, 1835,
and which was left in the hands of Mr. Ogden, tho
King's Attorney. He, it appeared, must have had
it in his possession, although it had been retained
against my will, and I had not been able to regain
it, after presenting it as a ground for judicial inves-
tigation.
He made different inquiries abcut my plans and
intentions, and spoke of my btended publication
with much ~olicitude, but in such a manner as to
show that he !Supposed it contained nothing more
than the manuscript he had seen. He remarked
that the priests in Canada did not blame me for
what I had done, being disposed to throw it all on
my advisers. He said he was glad I had not men-
tioned his name in speaking of the death of St.
Frances, and in another case, in which also I had
called him a priest. He would rather not have it
published that he was engaged in either of these
scenes.

present stat~ of things, money was wanted to carry
it on, which I had not at my command. The ste-
reotype plates ~ad not been paid for. He immedi-
ately said, th~t ~e would supply me wit~ money, to
a large amount if I wished, if I would let him have
the plat~s. I did · I}Of refuse this offer, for, nt the
time, I did Jl9t ~n~o,y that I ~hould ever ~e able to
publish the wo~~. n!Jr was I sure that it woulq be safe
for me to qo j~, o,n the one1hand, or useful' to the
world, pn the othe.r. It we~s evident that the pros-
pect of· getting posse~sion t)f the plates, raised great
hopes in lti~ mind; and h·~ showed much earnest-
ness iq pressing pis requ.est. It appeared to me,
however, th!lt he had a very erroneous idea of the
impo~tanc~ of *is object; for he seemed to thjnk
that if h~ c~Hl~ once get the stereotype plates, the
work wouJd b~ ~ff~ctually and forever suppressed;
whereas I could at any time have prepared an·

Alt4.o~gh Fatper ~helan had invited me to an
interview, on the pret.et)ce that he h~d something of
much imp~rtance .to Pie to communicate, ~ur con·
versation took such a turq, during most of the tip:te
I was in his company, that the promised informa-
tion was left out of view. He several times advert·
ed to things in Canada, but told me nothing of mucl,l
importance of any thing there. Once or twice ~l~q,
he spoke of our child : but ~n sue~ t.~rms as to dis-
please me very much, making some such expres-
sion as this, that he would rather it should have its

brains knocked out, than be brought forward aa s
witness agains~ him.
The only thing I can recall, whtch might be con-
sidered as any thing like the important information
he had said he had to communicate, was his declara-
tion that those in whom I confided, in New Yo:rk,
were not my friends, but in reality my enemies.
Of this he gave me no evidence, and of cour,,e I
was not much disposed to rely on his word: yet I
felt, as I had often done, that there was then but
few, very few, who entirely relied on my story, or
who seemed disposed to treat me with kindness
and friendship. Whatever I might think of those
around me in New York, however, I would notal-
low myself to confida in him so far as to be put off
my guard; and I let him clearly understand, that
although I was willing to talk with him, I was de-
termined to rega1d him with caution and suspi-
cion.
After a long interview, we parted i with an agree·
ment to meet on a future time at a particular place
where I \vas to acquaint him with my determination
concerning the sale of the stereotype plates. On the
same day, I intimated to one of my acquaintances,
thRt I knew how to obtain money, if it was thought
best, in exchange for the plates; but this caused an
alarm among those who felt interested for me, and
measures were 1mon taken which rendered the
assistance of Father Phelan quite unnecessary.
Accordingly, at the second interview, he lelll'ned

reach,
which appeart..'<l to produce a momentary regret ;
but he soon remr..rked that that was a matter of no
very great importance, for there was to be a publi-
cation in opposition to the work, as soon as it should
appear, which would prevent the people of the Uni·
ted States from believjng it; and besides, if I would
leave New York, return to Canada, and reside
there, as he wished me to do, I could come out.
with a public denial of it, and that would have all
the effect he could desire.
Soon after this time I changed my residence, and
stayed a while lit Wehawken, in New Jersey, op·
posite New Yvrk. As I occasionally visited the
city, he found opportunities to meet me several
times, in different places. He sometimes requested
me to see him again, always :professing to have
something more to say to me. It might, perhaps,
be thought, that it would have been more safe, pro·
per, or judicious, in me~ if I had refused all inter·
views with him from the first: but I began with a
belief that some one had attempted to impose upon
me; and after I had found it' to be Father Phelan
himself, who had come on from Canada, and was
urgent to converse with me, I found no particular
objection to make against another and another in·
terview ; and feeling more and more confident thnt
he dared not make any attempt to do me injury, or
to get me into his power, whi1e I conducted with
caution, I saw him time after time; and if any one
is to zuffer from this publication of it, it seems to be
himself rather than I. Wha.tever my reade!s may

\hink of my pr14dence or imprudence, however, thq
will not forget that I have had little instructi"lD, in
the course of my life, in the opinions and customs of
tociety, out of the Convent; and I am telling facts,
not undertaking to apologize for what has hap-
pened.
I will therefore proceed to remark, that when
Father Phelan proposed a place for meeting ~e, it
was commonly a different place from that where we
had met last, and I uniformly refused to meet at the
place proposed, and chose another. Always when I
went there, I found he had taken his station at a
distance from it, where he could observ~ my ap-
proach, and that he always seemed to discover me
a considerable time before I saw him. ·
He inti>rmed me one day, that there was a priest
with whom he had been conversing, nho wished to
see me, and asked my consent to an interview. I
refused, and so resolutely, that although he appear-
ed to wish it, he soon ceased to urge that request,
but proposed to let him stand at a distance, so that
he might see me, while we were conversing to-
gether.
Father Phelan wrote me a letter, while I was at
Wehawken, enclosed in one superscribed to the
person at whose hot1
se I stayed, requesting me to
meet him on one ofthe occasions above referred to.
It was not signed ; but I knew the author from t.h,e
band, and other internal evidenc«lS. After my re-
turn to the city, .and while in a retired situation in
the upper part of it, near the Dry Dock, he sent·

me another letter, by two boys, in which he desired
that I would meet him at a particular corner near
the Park, at nine o'clock; and although I was not
on the spot till about eleven, he came up and accost·
ed me, and prevailed on me to take a turn down
Spruce street, aml one or two others, while he
communicated some requests with much cogency.
There was, he said, a woman in another part of the
city, somewhere above Rroadway and Canal street,
who was much disposed to befriend me, and in whom
1 might place entire confidence. He recommended
to me to go and see her, and to take up my abode
with her, as I should be sure of good treatment.
He added that the lady was much more a friend to
me than to him ; which led me to suppose that she
did not fully confide in the character of priests, and
was suspicious of his intentions towards me. What
he said was calculated·to make me thh.k she might
be one of those Roman Catholic women, who know
something of what I know, and at the same time
that she possessed humanity enough to afford me
aid and protection, while she credited my story. I
refused ~o visit the house he indicated. to me ; but
t.l).e character he gave of the lady, I did not forget.
This was the last time I saw Father Phelan.
When we separated, he requested me to see him
again, near the same place: but I did not comply
with that desire. A considerable time afterwards, a
letter was brought to my lodgings, by two boys, •
which bore some marks of his; but I am unable to
say with certainty, whether he was the writer or not.
10 A.TTJUIPTB TO ABDUCT
I am not sure of th~ precise tim.e at which h,~
left New York; but I believe it was not far from tha,t
period. Such was the etate nf my feelings arising
from the perplexities attending the prepamtion and
publication of my first editions, that I sometimes felt
great uncertainty about the course I ought to pur-
sue. I sometimes feared that my pecuniary affairs
might become serious}y embarrassed, and apprehend-
ed that one o:r another individual might yet involve
me in great difficulty, in case my book should prove
unsuccessful, as I sometimes thought it would.
Being very ignorant of the laws, as I before r~mark­
ed, I (or a 'while lived under the impression, that
I might be at any time imp~;isoned for debts I had
not yet the means of payin'g. The incredulity of
many Protestants with whom I met, oft~n weighed
heavily on my spirits, and led me to c

what purpose was I disquieting·my mind, and ex-

whose benefit I wished to promote, seemed as sus-

iolent denunciations of my book which ,I
read in several Protestnrit newspapers, and the ina·
lignant and often unfounded ·attacks made by some
of them against the few persons who had first be·
lieved my tale and befriended me, helped to depre!S
my spirits : while the Montreal affidavits contained
several things that greatly wound~d me. Some of
those documents cast the most unfounded aspersions
upon my character, which 'it was impossible for mo
at once to remove by. opposing evidence, froin the
very nature of the case; and these, I had no doubt,
must have produced impressions on the minds ·of
some honest people, unfavorable·to me. But none
of these causes gave me half as much pain ns'the
affidavit of my mother. That long paper, (which
the reader will ·find in the Appendix to· the new
editions of niy "A,¥ful Disclosures,") contained so
many aspersions of my character, tmd-·,-tas written
in such a spirit, 'that I knew'not 'which mtisf ·stiffer

tainly, 1 think some excuse will be found in them
for my frequent change of purpose and varying
views of things.
An incident occurred about this period, which led
to some painful thoughts. A woman, in a plain
black dress, and accompanied by a boy, obtained an
introduction to me one day, by making fair repre·
sentations to some of my friends, on pretence of hav-
ing been converted from the Roman fnith, after re-
ceiving an education in a Convent in France. She
said she had always entertained a high idea of the
sanctity of nuns, and C()uld not be persuaded to doubt
it, by any of her friends, until she had read my book,
which she was now unable to disbelieve, on account
of the internal evidence of truth which it presented.
She wished to converse with me, and put a few
questions, that her mind might be a little further en-
lightened. She was therefore introduced, after giv-
ing her name and address, which was that of a
teacher of a private school in the lower part of the
city.
This lady having expressed a wish to see me in
private, we withdrew for some time, during which
she said some things which led me to suspect her
being a Roman Catholic in diseuise. She put sev-
eral questions to me, which I think must have been
put into her mouth by some priest. From other
expressions, I became convinced that she knew much
of nunneries. She then turned to ask some ques-
tions about my infant, and remarked, that she could

a pity it should live-it would be a kmdness if some-
body would take it out ofthe way-she could hardly
keep her hands offfrom it-she wished its neck was
wrung. I began to be somewhat agitated, and was
glad to get back into the other room among the
family. But the:re, strange as it was, she repeated
one or two of these expressions about my child; yet
left a piece of money in its hand on going away.
The impression this interview left with me, was
painful, although so unintelligible was the stran-
ger's conduct.
· She afterwards made me two or three calls, when
,he seemed still more wild and crazy than before:
for she once brought a young man with her, whom
I never saw before nor since, but whom she told me
she had induced to consent to marry me, urging me
to take him without ~elay for a husband. I an-
swered the woman very shortly, but it did not dis-
courage her. One of my friends soon afterwards
called at her school, and informed her that she could
not be again admitted to see me; wh€m her appear-
ance and manners were so equivocal as to excite
some suspicion that she had some project in view,
but nothing further has ever come to our knowledge
in relation to her.
·. Since I have spoken so much at length on the
state of my feelings about that period, I may add, that
the recollection of scenes in the Convent still con-
tinued at times to distress me. Although it appears
. to be gradually diminishing, it has not yet entirely
passed away; and about the period of which I speak,

it was more vivid than it is at present. I still ocea-
sionally r~Jvert to one event and another which I
have there witnessed, and sometimes review ·some
of the circumstances through which I have passed,
at different periods of my life, with distressing feel·
ings. I have also reason to believe, that some super-
stitious ideas inspired in early life, are not easy to·
be entirely eradf.cnted, even ·after the judgment has
been convinced of their erroneous nature.
As an evidence of the excitability of my fears in
sleep, I may mention, that a female friend who
lodged in the same bed with me ·about the time of
which ;I was speaking, waked me one night from a
most distressing dream. She informed me aft.er-
wards,'that on coming to bed·after I had fallen asleep,
I sprung wildly·up, seized her, :md with the appear•
ance of extreme terror, endeavored to throw her
from me, and to avoid her. When she had succeed·
ed in ·,vaking me, it was a long time ·before she
could compose me. I had been dreaming that !the
priests 'had tne again in the Black Nunnery, and
were just laying 'hold of me to inflict upon me
some dreadful punishment. ·Some time ·in the lnst
sprina, 'I was informed ·by a young Canadian,
whom I had formerly known, and \Vith whom I
had several times met within a few ·weeks in New
'York,.that a man had ·arrivcd from Montreal who
had expressed a ·desire to see me. He had repre-
sented ·himself as ·a firm believer in my "Disclo-

I. consented to an introduction, u did those friends
with whom I commonly consulted in such cases;
and hemnde me several calls, in which he conversed
at first in n manner corresponding with what I had
been led to expect. But on one or two occasions,

ments of n different nature, and expressed suspicions
of the motives of my Protestant friends. He also
threw out remarks which led me to suspect that he
had bad intercourse with some of the priests before
l~ving Montreal. I was displeased with his appa·
rent duplicity, and gave him little encouragement to
proceed : so that if be had any project, he did not
make it known to me.
Not long after my last. interview with Father
Phelan, and when I presumed he must have been
gone back to Canada, I formed the resolution one
day of calling on Mrs. B., of whom he had spoken
in such favorable terms. I found the house in
which abe had lodgings without difficulty; and, on
introducing myself to her, met witn a very kind an~
friendly reception. I had been afraid to go there
with Father Phelan, or during his stay in the city,
·even aJone, because it was a place he had recom-
mended, lest some plan might·have been formed to
get me~ into his power. I never, I believe, thought
of going to any house which he proJ.>OSed, without
the reflection that I might have my mouth stopped
·with a plaster, or in some other way.
16 ATTEMPTS TO ADDUCT
Mr!l. B. npressed great interert in me; and her
friendly reception induced me to speak of my own
u.tfni1:~ and feelings with perfect frankness, in u. pri·
vnte interview she gav~ me in u. room by ourselves.
When she heard my expressions of anxiety about
the results of my publication, she advised me to pro~
ceed no further, but to give up all. And this she
urged, not on the ground that it would injure the
priests, but merely a9 what was expedient for myself.
She did not question the truth of any part of my
story-far from it, she appeared to admit and believe
it nil, and to entertain feelings ofgreat enmity against
the priests. But she remarked that 1 had ~!ono
much, indeed quite as much as anybody could rea·
sonably expect of me; and now I ought to withdraw
from a situation that exposed me to many unpleas•
ant things, and tempted those around me to make
false professions of regard for my interests, that they
might gain something for themselves. She told
me that if I was disposed to live with her, I should
c.njoy all the advantages of retirement and comfort,
and she would undertake to ensure me a pleasant
home as long as I flhould wish to remain.
She went on to say, that if I wo-ald consent, she
would take a house arlywhere ou: of New York,
nnd makd Father Phelan furnish the money neces·
sary for our expenses, saying, however, that I need
not go to Canada. To all this I objected, and then
hinted at a kind offer I once received from one of
my uncles in Montreal, which she said she would

She thon urged mo to bring away my child from my
lodging ·, and go directly to her. · She was unable,
however, to get any promise out of me; for although
I believed her sincere in her professions of friend·
s!lip, I felt some fenrs of trusting myaelf wholly in
the power of any stranger de·voted to the Roman
Catholic faith.
I once conversed with her about my mother's
affidavit. She offered to ".vrite to her, as an old ac·
quaintance, to make inquiries on the subject.
1 had another interview with Mrs. B. soon .dier
the i"Ublication of my b01>k, when she pointed ;lut
several little things which she considered as inacc ll·
rate or inconsistent; and when the Montreal affida-
vits ~arne out, she told me they would probably ruin
the work, by convmcing the public that it was falae.
I had some conversation with her, some time aub-
Bequently to this, on the expediency of having some
man to take charge of my .affairs; when she pro·
posed her husband. When I objected to him as a
person unknown out ·Of his imme·jJate sphere, she
seemed displeased ; and when I mentioned the name
of .a dergymnn who I thought might possibly un-
dertake the task, she expressed anger, and said if I
trusted him I should be a ·beggar-it would be
jumping from the frying pan into the fire--and she
·went on abmring me in rather severe terms. She
·went indeed, so far, that I left the house, telling her
.I would never return ; l:::1t she called me back, and
explained .o. little, wishing to remove unfavorable
impressions from my mind.

CHAPTER III.
Letter from Father Phelan to a friend-Hie proposition• reiterated-
A letter from my unde-His arrival in New York-Interview with
him.
SoME time after this, (how long I do not know
with precision,) I rec~ived an invitation from Mrs.
B. to call at her house. I complied, when she
showed me a letter from Father Phdan, in which
he invited me to go to 0 tjada. I examined the let-
ter, and had reason to believe it was from him, partly
because it contained an expression, (" cher creur"-
,lear heart,) in th~ first sentence, which was alluded to
nt the close as a mark of its genuineness, and which I
felt confident no person but he would have used, as
it was one w!lich he had often introduced in conver-
-sation in the Nunnery.
Mrs. B. then told me she had receind a reply to
her letter to my mother, in which she declared that
she had neither written nor signed the affidavit
which was published as hers; but that she had been
prevailed on by the agency of some of the priests to
allow it to go out uncontradicted-some person hav-
ing written and published it in her name. She then
produced the letter &.nd showed it to me; and Ire-
cognised my mother's handwriting, which is very
peculiar, and almost impossible to be mistaken.
She, however, refused to let me carry away either ll
of tho letters.

She then urged me to apply to Father Phelan.
and, notwithstanding my unwillingness, wrote an
answer, which she insisted on my signing, though 1t
contained nothing that appeared to me of much im-
portance. On other occasions she showed me more
than one letter from Father Phelan, in which some-
thing was commonly said of me or my affairs; but
during all this time I maintained an unshaken reso-
.lution never to trust myself in his power, or to con·
·fide far in any person who I might suspect of being
confederate with him.
It happened, that owing to circumstances similar
to some I have before detailed, some time in tho
month of May, 1836, I made up my mind, that I
had better withdraw, if possibl_
e, from the excitement
and trials to which I had been so long subject, and
retire into obscurity in some country place, where I
might spend my life unknown. I thought that I
had perhaps done all my duty-1 had revealed as
much as would be believed. in thifl strife of mind,
·I naturally recalled a flattering offer made to·me by
an uncle one day, in August, 1835, during my visit
to Montreal, after my exertions to bring my charges
.to a legal investigation had failed. I thought I
·might safely apply to him. I accordingly wrote
him a letter, requesting him, if he could, to come to
·N~w Ycrk and remove me to some retreat such as
I have described ; and taking it to Mrs. B's, asked
her to forward it for me to Canada. This was
•tep which Father Phehm had never proposed or
even hinted at ; and ona which, I presumed, he
AT'l'EIIIPTS TO ABDUCT
would not be likely to approve o£ It was one
which.I thought would effectually secure me from
the power of the priests, of whom I felt as much
·dread as ever. If Father Phelan had even made
·the most distant suggestion in favor of it, that alone
would have been sufficientto det~r me from deciding
11pon its adoption. Mrs. B. took my letter with
readiness, and promised to forward it to Canada.
After a few days, I called again, when Mrs. B.
gave me a letter from my uncle, in which he ac·
knowledged the receipt of mine, and expressed his
willingness to comply with my wishes, but said I
-
had written jn such a manner that he apprehended
I might change my mind, and wished me to write
again if I adhered to JllY intention. He added, that
he had sent on money, and Mrs. B. could accompany
me part of the way to Montreal. I wrote again,
accordingly, repeating the former request, but de·
daring that I could never consent to trust myself in I
,,
Canada, nnd received an answer to that letter also,
1n which my uncle still expressed doubts of the firm·
ness ·of my purpose, and requested that I would still
write once more, saying, on the receipt ofmyletter he
would immediately set out for New York. From
the time when I made up my mind pretty decidedly
to go, I began to speak of it freely with some of my
New York friends ; but they opposed me, and ar·
.gued with me against it.
Jhappened to call once more at Mrs. B's, too soon,
as I knew, for my last letter to bring him from Mon.-

in town. I replied that I could not beiieve it; soon
after which she said he was ir. sight in the street,
and a person entered directly afterwards, whom I
recognised as him. My feelings almost overcame
me. Whatever was the cause, I was quite unable
to speak, and could hardly stand. His unexpected
appearance in so sudden a manner, filled my mind
with many painful thoughts and apprehensions; and
I immediately began to realize that I had in fact a
great repugnance to a step which I had before con-
sidered as easy and pleasant. Some of my friends
had solemnly warned me against trusting myself in
the power of any one from Canada, without some
good security ; and the thought of what might be my
·
fate in case I should, when too late, find my confi·
dence betrayed, quite overpowered me. At the same
time, the sight of a person just from Montreal, re-
vived many of the mos£ distressing recollections. I
was able at length to master my feelings, and en-
gaged in conversation with my uncle.
He spoke as if he expected to take me offwithout
delay, and appeared surprised when I expressed a
doubt ofbeing ready immediately. After cor.versing
together for a time in the house, we walked out, and
conferred at leisure on several topics interesting to
me~ He told me, thal although he had at first
thought only of having me with him at his residence
near Montreal, as I preferred not to return there,
he was willing to change his abode; and would re-
move to Vergennes, in Vermont, if I chose. Being
a bachelor, he could easily change his residence;
ATTE MPt'S TO ABDUCT
and he was willing to repent t() me the propositions
ho had made to me while in Montreal last summer,
vi::. to support me and my child for life, give me
tho care of his household, in place of his house-
keeper, without requiring me to contradict any thing
I had suid, although I had now published a book, and
then had only made an affidavit. 'fhe only condition
·_
awould require ofme, was, that I should henceforth
be silent about those things which had given me so
much trouble. and never publish any thing mor~
about the Nunnery. He seemed to think that I
ahould thus save myself much ,·exation and anxiety;
not intimating at all that he wished me to be silent
on account of the priests, whose part he did not pre-
tend to take. So far, indeed, was my uncle from
appearing as their advocate, that he cursed them
whenever they were spoken of, and seemed to have
not much better opinion of them than I had.
He spok4e also of my ocok, and of the measures
taken in relation to it, as well as of my being a ward
in Chancery, with such familiarity as to surprise me.
lle informed me that he had made many inquiries
on these subjects, n...ntioning bookstores at which
he had called, individuals with whom he had con-
versed on different points, without letting them sus-
pect who he was, and documents to which he had
had nccess ; and claimed to lmow more of some of
rny concerns than I did mysel£ All this showed a
·great interest in tne ; and~ naturally attributed it all
·to his regard for his unfortunate niece. He told me

'that I ~ had placed too much confidence m several
persons, who, under fair pretences, had gained great
advantages t(' theme~lve:t; and from that time after·
wards,he occasionally threw out ineinuations against
some of those whom I had most confided in, with
the mention of circumstanaes to,which he gave an
unfavorable aspect. This 'might arise,1I thought,
from his partiality for :
me, •
and I·was ·disposed to
excuse ·him, as ·he was not acquainted with those
persons, and·l •could not ·prevail on him to be intro·
duced to them.
Before my uncle parted from me, he told me I
might say, if any of my friends inquired about him,
that he was soon going to New Haven for nine days.
He went to within a short distance of my lodgings,
and then appointed to meet me the next day at a
house in Chrystie street, where I understood lodged
a Miss F., a friend of :Mrs. B. Some of my friends
whom I informed of my interview with my uncle,
were incredulous, thinking it was not himself. be·
ing apprehensive that some plan was on foot to get
me into the power of my enemies. They therefore
began to put some impediments in my way, object·
ing to my leaving home, and endeavoring to amuse
me in the house. The next day, however, I called
at the house indicated by my uncle, where I found
Miss F. in company with my uncle and two other
men, one of whom, a tall man, somewhat lame, I
recognised as Mr. F., her brother. This man I had
occasionally seen in my childhood, at my mother's,

m Montreal, but never knew much abo.
ut ·him, or
whether he had any protession.
His sister, who is a mantuamaker, is a Canadian
by birth and education, and has numerous and re·
spectable family connexions in Canada. One of her
cot~sins, I know, is a priest; and I might have said
the same of Mrs. B. How long Miss F. has lived
in New York, I do not know. She boards in a
Protestant family, as I :Joon discovered, as he re·
quested us to speak nothing but French, for fear. I
might become known to those in the house.

CHAPTER IV.
Arrival ofseveral Canadians-Interviews with them.
I HAD but a short interview with my uncle that
day, and soon returned home, without speaking to
either of the other men. I asked him, however, who
they were, and he informed me that they had lately
arrived from Canada, on a mere visit. I inquired
whether they came with him; and I now remember
that he did not answer, but spoke of something else.
The next day, as I was walking in that part of the
city, I was met by those two men, who addressed me
\"'.'ith cordiality; saying, they had learned from my
uncle that I intended tp leave the city and live with
Lim. They said he was a good man, and they
thought it would be a wise step on my part. I
should by all means accept of his propositions; but
I ought to avoid the Catholics. " But," said I,
11 what are you but Catholics~~~ They smiled, and
answered, 11 Ah, but we are not such as you need to
fear-we don't count ourselves Catholics."
They told me that my uncle would perhaps want
to see me occasionally, if I did not go at once ; and
proposed to fix on some way in which he might
give me information. They thought the best means
would be by writing, and lea•.ring a note in some
safe and convenient place. They said it would be
better not to have my uncle introduced to my friends,
IS
ATT£MPTI TO ABDUCT
because they would probably wish to prevent my
departure.
All this tirno they did not urge me to go, but con·
l'tnntly spoke of my journey ns of what I hud freely
determined on, and on which they would not influ·
cnce me, except so far as to express their opprobn·
lion of my decision, and to say, that tho sooner I
went, tho better it would be f9r me. Before they left
me, they mentioned that one or two other Canadians
were in the city, whom they thought I might like
to sec. I mudo .no objection to seeing them, qs they
said they felt n friendly int~rest in me, nnd wou~d be
pleased to have an il)terview.
'rhcy told me also, that while I remn,ncd whero
I was, they, as well as my uncle, wQuld feel mucJi
~nxiety for me, qnd would wish to bo assured of my
welfnro vt~ry frequenlly; for they had so bncl nn
opinion of those who professed ~o. much frit;ndsh~p
for mo, thnt they believed they hnd y~ry ovil designs,
and would be glad to murder me. I cquld ppt per-
suade them thnt this was out of .the qucstio,n, and
they insisted that in 9td.er to.satisfy _
them, they must
hnv~ some way jn which they could ~scertain from
time to time whether I was still in my present lodg-
ings, and alive and well. They proposed that ·-I
$hould spend much of my.time _
in my chamber, the
window of which they got me-to point out to them;
nmJ. to appear,at it wh~never I might see my uncle or
either of them passing. . In case they had any writ-

take on opportunity to visit tho spot agreed on for
the dcposite of their notea, and so ascertain whore
and when they might wish me to speak with them.
I hod made up my inind so decidudly in favor of
leaving New York, nnd plaeing myself under my
uncle's protection; that I gave soverul of my friends
distinctly to uhder$t&nd thnf such was my intention,
as I have before stated. Fearing that their mis·
judged kindness (as I then considered it) might
raise embnrrailsments in my wny, I however did not
intend to communicate to them the exact period
when I inta'nded to leave thtm. Indeed, I did not
myself agree with my uncle on noy precise day and
hour, until a few days beforehand. He passed my
lodgings on Sunday, the 22d of May, and stopped to
converse with mo. We then pitched upon Wednes-
day, the 25th of Mny, nt- o'clock in the afternoon.
At thnt time I was to meet him at Mrs. B's; or if
any thing prevented, I wns to go where I could
with my· child, arid such of my clothes ns I could
bring with me, when he would be prepared soon to
remove mo beyond the reach of pursuit or inquiry.
I hnd been under much excitement nnd disquietude
for many days, nnd ll]Y trouble only increased a~ the
period approached. I haddone much to try the fnend·
snip of those around me, who had argued with me
agninAt the intentions Ihad a:vowtMI; but their interest
.inmewas not socooled but theycontinuedtowatch rne
1nd toke kind precautions to prevent my elopement.
28 ATTEMPTS TO ABDUOT
I did not inform them when I intended to set out
on my journey, but they had o. suspicion of it.
I was nt home on the afternoon of Sundl\y, May
22, and while I was sitting at the parlor window,
my uncle ond another man stopped before me
on the sidewalk, and began to talk with me. My
uncle proposed to me to leavt• the house and go with
him. He said, Mr. S. is now in church, you can
come as well as not. I replied that I would not go
without my child. He inquired where it wus, and
I told him a girl had taken it to Williarnsburgn. He
made particular inquiries about the thne when she
was to return, the way, and the appearance and dress
of the girl, to which I reaciily replied. He thea
soon left me, with his companion.
After a tiJ 1e, the girl returned with my babe; nne.:
of her own accord began to tell us that she had been
much alarmed by the conduct of a man who had
accosted her on board the ferry boat. She described
him in such a way as to convince me that it could
be nobody but my uncle. He had approached her,
spoke of the child, offered to take it in his arms,
ealled it his own, spoke to it, played with it, and
was hardly to be prevented from tr·.king it away
from her. She was unwilling to give its mother's
name in the boat, and suppressed it, but refused to
part with it, saying she was not permitted to let ~
stranger take it. The man, however, at length be·
came so urgent, that she was obliged to tell him
she would certainly call for help if he did not desi6t.

Pl.yarTaJIIcmenta to leave New York- Aecldcnlal defeat of my plau•-
Dlaappolntinent- Alarmlnl lntelll1ence-The IIJeret oporallnna of
my enemlu expo1ed.
I DID not inform my friends of the ~imc we hall
agreed on for my departure, for that I feared would
entirely defeat my intention. I sometimes fdt n little
doubt of the kindness of their feelings, so many
imputations had been cast upon their motives by my
uncle and his acquaintances. Even when I believed
them sincere, I thought they misjudged concerning
my real interests. From something that took place,
as I since have learned, my friends were very suspi·
cious that I intended to leave them on Wednesday;
and they wer~ doubly,watchful of me that day.
Knowing my unwillingness to be separated from
my babe, they felt little uneasiness about my leaving
them, so iong· as they had her in their possession ;
and t found an opportunity to go round to Mrs. B's
about 3 o'Clock on 'Vednesday, to request my
uncle to wait for me in a carriage at a near point,
where it would be more convenient to join him in
three·qtia'rters of an hour. I then set off for home
to get rhy babe, he accompanying me a part of the
way. I stopped a little in Grand street, to wait for
nil omnibus, when I felt a wish to see a family once
more ·whose residence was near, and from whom I
had received many ma.rl{s of disinterested kindness.
I \vent in and told them I hnd cal1ed to take leave,
18*
30 ATT.E.Ml''CS TO ABDUCT
as I expected soon to leave New York. They
were a little apprehensive, as I since have learn~
that I might then be on the eve of my departure, ond
wishing to detain me as long as possible, urged me
to sit again when I rose to depart. Their urgency
was so strong that I complied, and twice afterwards
was persuaded again to sent myself; At length J
got away, and hastened home to get my infant; but
here I had to encounter a new delay. Two of my
female acquaintances were in the house alone; and
when I entered I hoped they would not oppose my
wishes. To my disappointment, however, they made
decid~d opposition to my getting possession of my
child, good-naturcdly it is true and with every ex·
pression ofinterest in her and myself, but so resolute·
ly that I could do nothing. At length, after an hour's
delay, I got my babe into my arms, and proceeded
to the corner ofAvenue D and Houston street, where
I was to have met my unde about two hours before.
He was not there, but I presumed had got weary
of waiting for me, and perhaps becoming suspicious
of my inten~ions, might have gone away in disgust.
At a corner not fur off, I was accosted by three of
the Canadians I have before spoken of, though,
such was the excitement of iny feelings, I cannot
remember which they were. They told me my
uncle had been waiting for me at the time appointed,
and that they were willing to go and request him to
wait for me at Mrs. B's, at the same time advisin~
me to get into an omnibus. They immediately

·lowing them at once iu the first omnibus I could
find, when it occurred to me that I had better return
ltome n moment for my clothes, which I had previ·
ously arranged to take with me. 1 therefore called
in at the house of n woman whom I had occasion·
nlly seen, and requested permission to lt:nve my
child there for a few moments, till I could return
home, adding something else which 1 do not very
distinctly recollect. She not only consented to this,
but expressed a willingness to go and help me bring
away my clothes, when she understood that I had
no one to assist me in carrying them. Leaving my
child, therefore, we proceeded together to my lodg·
ings; but on reaching them, I found that my depar-
ture with my infant had caused much excitement
among my friends. One of them had already gone
to the police to prevent, if possible, my departme
from the city; and the'news had been communicated
to some ofthe newspaper offices, under the full persUii-
sion that I had been unsuspecting1y decoyed into the
power of my enemies, and that, ifI were once got out
ofthe city, I should probably n~ver again be heard of.
The two kind females whom I hgain found aloue
in the house, were therefore rejoiced to see me
again, but they were much more resolute than before
in opposing my wishes. One of them stepped out
and called her brother to her aid, who promptly
came, and interposed such impediments to my leav-
ing the bouse that I found myself again disappointed,
and compelled, though at the time with pain and re-
gr<'t, to abandon the plan I, as well as others, had
ta'kcn such trouble to acromvlish.

t afterwards learnt that eome of iny friends, whb
had heard from me that my uncle and other persons
from Canada, were making arrangements for my
departure from New York, had consulted on having
them apprehended. Application was first made to
one of the city magistrates, but he gave it as his
opinion that whatever sus}'3cion might be had, there
was not evidence enough to act upon. ~..4.. lawyer
was consulted by another of my friends, who recom·
mendeci the immediate adoption of measures for their
apprehension; in consequence of which, he applied
at the upper police. The magistrate, after hearing
the stihe of things, thought .the circumstances very
~;trcng, and that they gave room to presume that a
serious plot had been formed to get me away. He
called the next day to converse with me, accompa-
nied by another person; but when he had considered
the circ~mstances at leisure, he remarked that they
appeared to have kept just within the bounds of law,
and never to have transgressed, so that they had not
committed any overt aet which might have rendered
them amenable. He expressed surprise at the evi-
dence he found of their caution, and said it was
clear to him that they had been acting under first
rate advice.
I confess that it was pleasii1g to me, that they
were not to be proceeded against; for it was painful
to think of having persons arrested on a high
c~arge, with whom I had so rec'ently been on terms
ofapparcnt mutual confidenc·e.

llltionR made by my unde, and warmly approved
by the Canadians I ha.,,: SG• often met, were in
good faith, and dictated by a sincere interest in my
welfare. I fully believed their story, as they had
repeatedly declare..:. it, viz.: that the plan originated
with my uncle when I was last in Montreal; that
neither his Canadian companions nor any one else
had known of it, or had any interest in carrying it
through; that it was entirely owing to accident that
my uncle had met with any of his acquaintances in
New York; and that the pains they had taken to in-
duce me to accede to his wish, grew out of their
friendly disposition towards me.
An occurrence took piace, however, a short time
after tha e\'ents which I have narrated above, which
produced a sudden and very powerful change in my
feelings. An evening ,or two after the disappoint.
ment of my plans, a gentleman called on me, witG.
whom I had been acquainted for several months,
and in whose character. I had reason to place entire
confidence. He made some remarks, and asked
three or four questions which filled me with sur-
prise. I at once perceived that he had some know·
ledge of the Canadians I had conversed with, which
nobody but an intimate acquaintance could have
communicated. It is not my design here to convey
a particular account of this interview, as the time
has not yet arrived when it \vill be proper to do so.
I will only add, that in a few sentences my friend
introduced several expressions which had fallen
from the lips of the ~anadians in my hearing, and
84 ATTEMPT! TO ABDUCT
alluded to afew circumstances to which they also
had alluded; and although both the expressions and
the circ'umstances would nave been, of themselves,
unworthy of any serioiJs regard, in the connel:ion
in which they came lip; they convinced me, in a
inost'serious.and ~ogent mariner, that I had but just
escaped·a deep laid and dangerous pJot. One suh-
j~ct· to which allusion was thus blindly made was
the same to which the Canadian already mentioned,
had alluded in a: private interview with me. I
shuddered; for·I sa'w, to my own entire co~viction,
that the seventeen Canadians, instead of being my
friends, and merely. casual visiters in New York,
had com~ here only for thk .purpose of inveigling
me back into the power Of my enemies j and that
tltey had been for many days practising profound
duplreity merely for the purpose of deceiving me.
Even if this, though strongly indicated, w 89 not in
fact fully proved, yet I had unquestionable evidence
that the person from v.•hom the questions proposed
to me lind proceeded, must be intimately acquainted
\vith the character and intentions, the motives and
plans of the Canadian troo~nd I turned, with the
deepest solicitude, to my frie'nd, to inquire what infor·
matibn he had of them and their operations. 'l'o
my questions he replied, with solemn declarations
that I had barely escaped from a plot which had
been long maturing in Montreal ; and that the indi-
t idua'l primnnly engaged in directing its accom-
plish'ment, had acted under the promise of a reward
.of fiftee.i} tho·usund dollars in case of success.

Records made by me of my "diaclosures"-My first'opinion ofMiss

Intervlew with a New York lady about to become a nun.
SINCE the publication of my first edi~io~, I have
had different things brought to my memory, .which
I had forgotten :while reviewing in it the past sce~es
ofmy life. Some ofthese have presented themselv~s
to me while meditating alone, by day or by night; and
others have been brought to mind by conversing ~vi.~h
others. I have seen a.number of my former ~cqua.~~t·
ances, aQ.d in my interviews with them, my me~ory
~s .oft~n been refreshed ;~m one subject or another.
Duri~g a conversation I ~~d in Marcli last, with
Mr. John Hilliker of New York, who by so kindly
persisting in taking me frolll my exposed retreat,
:,aved my life ~s I believe, and introduced me to ~he
;Almshouse, .he recalled to n:tY mind a paper :whi<;h
I hdd in my hand when he found me in a field. I
did not mention that paper in my S~quel, because I
did not think of it. He rnenti~ns, in his affidavit,
that I refused to let him see it, and tore it in pieces,
when I found P,e was resolved to remo.ve me. I
.had made up my,mind that I was soc.,.. to die. .In·
deed, although I have felt unwilling to dec~are it
.heretofore, my intention had b.een to die by ·st~rva·
tion, in the lonely place where I had taken ~y
abode. Somotimes this resolution failed me for a
, r' ,
36 AT·rEMP't8 TO ABDUCT
time, and I would eat, and even send the little bey
who visited me, to buy a few cakes. Sometimes,also,
1 thought of destroying my life by other means j but
still thinking it would have some merit in the sight
of God, to disclose the worst of the crimes I had wit·
ncssed in the Nunnery, I determined to leave behind
me a record which might be picked up after my death,
whenever and ho\vever that event might come upon
me. I therefore one day sent Tommy to buy me some
paper; and, understanding I wanted to write, he·
brought me :m inkstand and pen, as I believe from
his mother's house. I wrote a brief statement offacts
upon' the paper, and folded it, I believe, in the form
ofa letter, after signing it, as I think, with my Chris·
tian name only, "Maria." T his was the paper which
Mr. Hilliker endeavored to obtain, and which I tore,
~o prevent it from being seen, when I thought deatl~
was not so near as I had supposed.
The Sunday before the birth of my child, I again
wrote, with similar feelings, and in a similar style,
and hid the paper. But I afterwarGs took it again
and burnt it.
While I was in the Asylum, a gentleman who
had Miss Reed's book,(" Six Months in a Convent,")
read some pa~~ages in my presence, which irritated
me so much that I spoke to him with passion, and
I fear almost insulted him. I had never heard of
such a person or such a book before, but I bel.ieved
.every thing I heard, because it corresponded with my
own experience, so far as it went ; but I thought, at
that momrnt, that it was wrong to make known such

things to the world, ns it was calculated to injure
the Church : in such an unsettled state did my
mind continue to be for a considerable time. It was
perfectly evident to me, however, that the institution
where she wns_. must be materially different from
the Black Nunnery, as it was far ~m being so
close, or governed by such strict rules. She also
had been in it too short a time to learn all; and be-
sides, being only a novice, it was impossible that
she should be fully acquainted with many things
which are communicated Jnly to nuns.
· While I was iu the Asylum, I had once made up·
my mind to confess to Mr. Conroy, after receiving
his invitations and threatening messages, being
strongly urged by some of the Catholic women
about me. It happened, most fortunately for me,
that I was befriended and advised by an excellent
woman, Mrs. Neil, who took great pains to instruct
and influence me aright. When I had decided on
obeying the summons of the priest, Mrs. Neil came
in, and hflving ascertained my intention, urged me
to reflect, and impressed it upon my mind, that I
was responsible to God, and not to man, for my con-
duct, and that his power and authority over me were
only pretended. I believe I had then sometimes
more confidence in priests than in God Almighty.
She assured me that I had rights, and had friends
there who wou]d protect me. I then determined
not to go to Confession.
I have generally found it easier to convince
Catholics than Protestants of the truth of my story,

if they come to me with doubts or evt"n unbelie£
Since the first appearance of my book, I have re·
ceivcd visits from a great number of persons in con·
sequence of what they had seen or heard of its con·
tents; and among these have bc~n a considerable
number of Catholics. While I am able to say that
I hnvc had the satisfaction of removing all doubts .
from the minds of some Protestants whom I have
seen, I must confess that in general I have received.
the greatest satisfaction from interviews with intelli·
gent Catholics. The reason of this is, that I know·
better bow to treat the latter in argument. Having
been one myself, I know where their difficulties
lie, how to appeal to their own minds, and how
to lead them to correct conclusions. Perhaps I can
best convey my meaning to my readers, by giving a
brief account of some of the interviews alluded to.
There is an interesting little girl whom I have.
repeatedly conversed with, (the daughter of an igno-.
rant Catholic woman,} who has enjoyed some of the
advantages of instruction in the scriptures, and sub-
mits with extreme reluctance to the ceremonies
which her mother requires her to perform, in com-
pliance with the requisitions of her priest. She be·
lieves my book, and she has reason for it. She ha·s
acknowledged to me, though with shame and reluc-
tance, that, when compelled by her mother to confess
to Father uu, in his private room, he has set with
h1s arms arou~d her, and often kissed her, refusing
money for the usual fee, on the plea that he never
requires pay for confessing pretty girls. He told

her the Virgin Mary would leave her if she told o.
it. His questions are much tho same as I have
heard. All this I can believe, and do believe. I
need not say that I tremble for her fate.
During the first week in March, 1836, I received
a visit at my lodgings in New York, from a young
woman, of a Protestant family in this city, who had
received a Roman Catholic education. Slie called,
as I understood, at the urgent request of her mother,
who was exceedingly distressed at her daughter's
intention to enter a Canadian nunnery.
Part of our interview was in private; for she re-
quested me to retire with her a little time, where
we might be alone; and I found her intention was,
by certain queries, to satisfy herself whether I had
ever been a Roman Catholic. She inquired if I ,.
could tell any of the questions commonly asked of
wome.n in the Confession box; and on my answer-
ing in the affirmative, she desired me to repent some,
which I did. This .satisfied her on that point; and
I soon became so far acquainted with the state of her
mind, as to perceive that she was prepared to nyoid
the influence of every argument that I could use
against the system to which she had become at-
tached.
She confessed to me, that she had given five hun-
dred dollars to the Cathedral, and n considerablQ
sum to St. Joseph's Church, and that she had decided
on entering a nunnery in Canada. I inquired why
she did not enter one in the United States. To this
she replied, that she had only one objection; her
ATTII:IIIt •U '1'0 ADD1J~T
Confessor, Father Pies, having told her thut he
would by no means recommend the latter, ant
greatly preferred the former, because the priests had
entire control over the Canadian nunneries, which
they had not of those in the States. This, and
some other parts of our conversation, took place in
the presence of other persons: and on hearing this
declaration of the priest, the motive of which was to
us so palpable, a lady present laughed outright.
While we were alone, on her expressing a doubt
of the crimes I have charged upon the priests, I
!aid, 1
but you admit that they havo said and dono
!uch and such things, (which I do not like to re~
pent.) She signified assent. 1,hen, said I, how can
you pretend that any thing is too bad for them to do~
I also said, you admit that they have asked you in the
Confession box, whether you ever wished to commit
bestiality. She replied, " Ycs ; but if we have not evil
thoughts, there is no harm." " You admit that they
have treated you with great familiarity at confes-
sion1" She replied, that she confessed to her priest
while he sat in a chair, and that he had ; 11
but,''
said she, 11
you know a priest is a holy man, and can·
not sin." And when I pressed her with another
question, she confessed that her priest h'l.d told her
she could not -
;.:,., sanctified without having perform-
ed an act commonly called criminal, and replied in a
similar manner.
She was ashamed or afraid to assert her full
faith in some of the doctrines she had been taught,
when I loudly and emphatically demnndccl of her,

whether she did indeed credit them. This was tho
case with her in regard to tho pardon of sins Ly
priests, the existence of purgatory, or a mid<.llo
place, &c. She spoke of these anll other subjects
as if sho believed in them: but when I said, 11

got it out of her, that she hnd conversed with her

that I was not royse)~ not Maria Monk, but an evil

WHILE I was a novice, there was a young lady
of our number from the Tannery,• named Ange-
lique Duran~eau, with whom I was somewhat ac-
quainted, and of whom I had a favorable opinion.
She was about -
:.:ighteen, and at the time of her en·
trance had every appearance of good health. Af.
ter she had been there a considerable time, it might , I
be about seven months, (as I know she was not near
the period when she could ml\ke her general confes·
sion, that is, at the end of the first year,) I saw her
under circumstances which made a strong impres·
.aion on my mind.
I had received a summons from the Superior to
attend in the Novices' sick-room, with several other
novices. When I entered, I found Fathers Savage
and Bonin reading a paper, and Miss Duran~e.au
m a bed, with a look so peculiar as quite to shock

me. Her complexion was dark, and of an unnl\tU·
rul color, her look strange, and she occasionally
startt~d and conducted very singularly indeed, though
she never spoke. Her whole appearance was such
as to make me think she h11d lost her reason, and
almost terrified me. The Superior informed us that
she wanted us as witnesses ; and the priests then
coming forward, presented the paper to Miss Duran·
~eau, and asked her if she was willing to give all
her property to the church. She replied with a feeble
motion of the head and body, and then, having n pen
put into her hands, wrote her name to it without
reading it, and relapsed into apparent unconscious·
ness. We were then requested to add our signa·
tures, which being done, we withdrew, as we enter-
ed, I believe without the sick novice having had any
knowledge of our presence, or of her own actions.
A few hours afterwards I was called to assist in
laying out her corpse, which was the first intimation
I had of her being dead. The Superior, myself,
and one or two other novices, had the whole of this
melancholy task to perform, being the only persons
admitted into the apartment where the body lay.
It was swelled very much. We placed it in a cof·
fin, and screwed on the cover alone. On account of
the rapid change taking piace in the corpse, it was
buried about twenty four hours after death.
Not long after the burial, two brothers of Miss
Duranl(eau came to the Convent, and were greatly
distressed when told that she was dead. They com·
plaincd of not being .informed of her sickness: but.
DLAOJt NUNNERY.
the Supc.lior assured them that it was at the urgent
request of their sister, who was po::;sessed of so
much humility, that she thought herself unworthy
of attracting the regard of any one, and not fit to
be lamented ev~n by her nearest friends. 11
'Vhat
was she," she had snid, according to the declara.
tions made by the Superior, 11
what was she that
sh~ should cause pain to her family?"
This wns not the only occasion on which I was
present at the laying out of the dead. I assisted in
three other cases. Two of the subjects died of con·
~Jumption, or some similar disease; one of whom
was ah old-country girl, and the other n squaw.-
The latter seemed to fa1lnway from the time when she
came into the nunnery, until she was reduced almost
to a shadow. She left to the Convent a large amount
of money.
Several stories were told us at different times, of
nuns who had gone into a state of sanctity in the
Convent. One, who had excited much attention and
wonder by prophesying, was at length found to be-
in such a condition, and was immediately released
from the duty of observing the common rules of the
Convent, as the superior considered her authority
over her as having in a manner ceased.
It was affirmed that many priests had been taken
to heaven, body nnd soul, after death.
The following story I was told by some of the
mms and the superior while I was a nCivice, and'
made a considerable impression upon my mind.-

room while the nuns were kneeling and engaged in
prayer. It addressed one of the nuns and the Supe·
rior, not only in an audible voice, but in a string of
French rhymes, which were repented to me so often
that I learnt them almost all by heart, a_
nd retcin seve-
ral to this day.

' Un grnnd honneur je voue confcre,

These were the first two lines. In the sequel the
dove informed the audience th!lt in eight days the
spirit of the nun should be raised to heaven, to join
its own, and that of other souls in that blessed place;
and spoke of the honor thus to be conferred upon
the nun, and on the Superior too, who had had the
training of one to such a grade of holiness.
When the day thu~ designated arrived, a number
of priests assembled, with the Superior, to witness
her expected translation; and while they were all
standing around her, she disappeared, her body and
soul being taken off together to heaven. The win·
dows had been previously fastened, yet these offer·
ed no obstacle, and she was seen rising upward like
a column moving through the air. 'fhe sweetest
music, as I was assured, accompanied her exit, and
continued to sound the Jemainder of the day, with
such charming and irresistible effect, that the usual
occupations of ihe nuns were interrupted, nnd all
joined in and sang in concert.

CHAPTER II.
Story of Ann, the S~otch Novice-Letters of her lover-The Superior'•
deception-1\lisR Farnes-Ann's determination to leave the Convent
-Means taken to persuade her to stay.
THERE was a young girJ, named Ann, who was
very stout and rather homely, but not of pleasing
manners, though of a good disposition, seventeen or
eighteen years of age, to whom I took a liking.
She was a novice with me, and the time of which I
am 1to speak, was not long after I returned from St.
Denis. The Superior also displayed a partiality for
her. and I found she was much in favor of having
her received.as a nun, if it could be accomplished.
·She was very handy at different kinds of work ; and,
wht~t I believe chiefly induced me to regard her
with kindness, she was a fatherless and motherless
child. She had a beau in town, who one day
called to see her at the nunnery, when she was
going to confession.
I was with the Superior at the time, who, on be-
ing informed that the young man was there, and of
his errand, requested me to go into the parlor with
her, to meet him. He put into the Superior's hands
a parcel and three letters, requesting her to give
them to Ann. She took them, with an expression
of assent, and he withdrew. Just as he had gone,
Ann tame hurrying into the parlor, saying that
some one had told her that the Superior had sent for

her. The Superior rebuked her sharply, and sent
her back, without, however, showing her what she
had promised to give her. Ann ~aid, that she had
understood a young man (mentioning her visiter)
had called to se~ her. 'fhis the Superior denied,
telling her never to come till she was wanted.
When Ann had gone, the Superior told me to go
with her to her room, which I did. She there first
made me promise never to tell of what she was go·
ing to do, and then produced the let~ers and package,
and hegan to open them. One of the letters, I re·
member, was folded in a singular manner, and fast·
ened with three seals. In the parcel was found a
miniature of the young man, a pair of ear rings, a
breast pin, and something else, what, I have now for·
gotten. The letters 'yere addressed to her by he·r !
lover, who adviscold her by all means to leave the
Convent. He informed her that a cousin of hers, a
tailor, had arrived from Scotland, who was in want
of a housekeeper; and urged her to live with him,
and never renounce the Protestant religion in which
she had been brought up.
I was surprised that the Superior should do what
I felt .to be very wrong and despicable; but she re-
presented it as perfectly justifiable on account of the
good which she had in view.
I considered myself as bound to be particularly
obedient to the Super!or, in order th11t I might make
my conduct correspond with the character given of
me to her, by Miss Bousquier, who, as I have men·
tioned in the sequel of my first volume, had shown

me an evidence of h~r friendship by recommending
me to her, and becoming, in some sense, responsi-
ble for my good conduct, to induce her to receive
me back into the nunnery. This was a strong rea·
son for my complying with the Superior's wish' in
the case of which I am speaking.
Since I have alluded here to the period of my re·
turn to the Convent, ! may remark that the Superi.
or took some pains to ascertain, by her own inqui-
ries, whether there was substantial reason for reli·
ance on the favorable opinion expressed to her of
me by Miss Bousquier. I recollect particularly her
iriquirmg of me whom I had conversed with, while
at St. Denis to persuade them to enter the Black
Nunnery: ;ur Miss Bousquier, I understood, had
informed her that I had shown my attachment to the
Hotel Dieu, by making favorable representations of
it while with her engaged in keeping school. To
the Superior's inquiries I replied, that I had urged
little Gueroutte to become n nun. She was the
daughter of Jean Richard, as he was familiarly
called, to distinguish him from a number of other
men of nearly the same name: for he had exten-
sive family connexions in that place. He livf:Jl op·
posite Miss Bousquier, so that I had had frequent op-
portunities to c.onverse with his daughter.
. But not to detain my readers longer on this di·
gression, I will return to my story and poor An~,
the Scotch girl. Having rec.eived particular instruc·
tions from the Superior, I promised to endeavor .to .
get into her confidence, for the purpose of influ~n-

cing her to take the veil, and to proceed in accord·
ance with the direc.tions given me. The Superior
told me by no means to make any approaches to her
at once, nor indeed for some tir:1e, lest she should
suspect our design; but to wait awhile, until she
could have no reason to think my movements might
have grown out of the circumstances above mention·
ed: for Ann appeared to be uncommonly penetrating,
as the Superior remarked; and of course much cau-
tion was necessary in dealing with her. Some time
subsequently, therefore, I cannot tell exactly how
long, I engaged in conversation with her .;.ne day,
in the course of which she remarked that Mil:ls
Farns, a confidential friend of hers, who had spent
a short time in the nunnery some time before, was
soon coming back.
This Miss Farm.' had come in . on trial, while I
was in the Convent, and I had often heard the Su-
perior say, that she must be separated from Ann,
because they were so much together, and so often
oreaking the rules. Ann now told me in confi-
dence, that he.r friend was coming back, not with
any real intention of staying, but only for the pur-
pose of giving her some ir.iormation favorable to her.
self, which she had obtai lP-d. This she wished to
become fully possessed of before she would decide
whether to leave the Convent or not.
All.this I communicated to the ·superior, who
then began to look for Miss Farns' return, with a
·'determination to treat her with every.appearance.of
kindness. She often, in the mean time, gave me lit·

tie delicnCiee, with directions to share them with
Ann. Miss Farns soon presented herself for re.
admission, and was admitted without any difficulty,
not being required even to change her dress. This
occurred, as nearly as •I can recollect, about six
weeks after the affair of intercepting Ann's letters;
mentioned a few pages back, and somewhere about
the close of summer, or the beginning of autumn.
Being allowed to do pretty much as they chose;
Ann and her friend were much together, and gen.
crnlly engaged in deep conversation : so that, as the
Su~erior declared, it was evident they were forming
some plan for ser.ret operations. I trit'd several
times to get near and overhear what they were talk-
ing about : but I could not learn any thing. The
next day Miss F arns departed, saying she never in·
tended to return; which offended the Superior so
much, that she said she would have the doors shut
if she ever came again.
The same evening Ann requested me to tell the
Supm·ior, that she wished to get her clothes, that
she might leave the Convent. 1 went to the Supc:
rior's room, where:.I found Fatller Bonin sitting on
the sofa talking with her. When they were informed
of Ann's message, the Superjor said, she would let
the girl go at once back to the world, and be given
up to the devil. Bonin argued a good deal against
this. 'rhe Superior replied, that she had set the old
nuns at work, but without success; they had not
been able to influence Ann as she desired ; and it
was a shame to keep such a creature within holy

she decided on the course to pursue; and turning
to me, said : take her up stairs, give her her c1othes,
yet argue with her in favor ofremaining in the Con·
vent, but at the same time tell her, that I am indif-
ferent about it, and care not whether she goes or
stays.
I accordingly returned to Ann, and telling her that
she might fol1ow me up stairs and get her clothes,
led the way, and delivered them to her. In obedi-
ence to my orders, I lost no time in representing
her intentions to depart from our holy residence as
an insinuation of the devil; and told her that he
was trying his best to draw her out into the world,
~hat he might secure her for himself. I told herthat
he had a strong hold upon her, and she ought to use
the greater exertions to resist his temptations; that
the Superior thought it might be better on the whole
if she departed, because her influence might be very
injurious to others if she remained; yet that I felt a
deep interest in her, and could not bear to have her
perform her intention, because I well knew that her
throwing off the holy dress th~ . 1he then wore, to
take her former one, would be the first step towards
damnation.
" You need not talk so to me/' replied Ann, " you
~ave done the same yourself." I told her that if I had,
~ had lived to regret it, and was glad to get back
t9 the Convent again. After a while an old nun

ease I should prevail with her to remain, to make
her go down and beg pardon for the scandal she
had caused by her conduct, and ask to be taken
back again into the flock of the good shepherd, as
the Superior was often called.
Poor Ann at length began to listen t0 :ne; and I
got her to repeat to me all that Miss Farw11
.Lid said to
her during her late short visit to the nunnery. The
amount of it was, that if Ann would come out ~t
dusk, and go to a particular house, she would find
her relations waiting for her, who had arrived from
Scotland-they were, if I mistake not, her brother
and1
cousin. Having prevailed upon her to break
her engagement to meet them, I soon persuaded her
to go down stairs as a penitent, apd there she hum.
bly kneeled, and in the usual manner kissed ·the
feet of the Superior, and all the novices, and begged
and obtained a penance, which was to serve as an
atonement for her offence. This was, to fast three
mornings, ask forgiveness of all her companions on
the same days, and perform acts of contrition.
That evening the Superior called me to tea in her
own room, when I told her all that I had learnt from
the confession of Ann, who I knew was fasting at
the time. When the Superior understood the plan
proposed by Miss Farns, she spoke of her in very
severe terms, and then commended me~ saying that
I ought to rejoice at having saved a soul from hell,
but ought to guard against pride, as I had accom·
plished what I had undertaken only by the help of
fue Virgin Mary.

Ann continued to behave as she l1ad promised,
and we heard nothing more of any attempt by her
friends to get her out of the nunnery. Not long
after, however, she was taken sick, and I ascertain·
ed, from observation and inquiry, that the cause of
it was her discontentment, r..~ she complained of
loneliness. I felt compassion for her, and told the
Superior that J thought she ought to be treated with
more leniency. She said she would get some of
the old nuns to talk with her a little more.
Ann was received, in due time, ns a nun. I was
not present at the ceremony, but I afterwards met
with her, and several times had a little conversatioft
with her.

CHAPTER III.
Miss noss.-Our early Pcquaintancc.-ller request.
THERE was a girl whom I knew from a child, a
Miss Ross, the recollection of whom gives me deep
pain: for I know too well that I have been-the cause o.f
great misfortunes to her. I remember being with
her at different times in my early days. After our
family removed to Montreal, and had our residence
in th.b Government House, we often had calls from
persons of our acquaintance, as many were fond of
walking in the garden, or green, as we commonly
called it.
Such of my readers as have visited that city will
be likely to remember the place of our residence:
for the Government House, of which my mother is
still the keeper, is of very large size: (I have some.
times heard it spoken of as the most ancient in
America.) It was said that the foundation stones of
that and the old French church were laid on the
same day, as recorded. The gateway is of stone,
and it is furnished in a manner becoming the resi.
dence of the Governor of the Province. The gar.
den and green are of great extent, and present fine
walks and flowers; and as the former overlooks
the esplanade, to which it is adjoining, it was a favor·
ite resort on Sunday afternoons, when the troops are
on parade.

MISS ROSS.
Miss Ross, I recollect, one evening m particular,
paid me a ,•isit with a Miss Robinson; and we
amul!cd ourselves together in the green. · Her moth·
er lived a little out of the city, near the Lachine road.
She was a Hcotch lady, and possessed a Jarge pro-
perty. When Miss Ross grew up, she became at•
tached to a young man of my acquaintance, and in·
deed a relation of my mother; but when it became
known, she found her mother very much opposed
to her wishes.
'Vhile I was a novice in the Hotel Dieu, Miss
Ross came in as one ; and we had frequent inter·
views together, as our acquaintanee still continued,
and indeed we had always been friends. She be-
came informed of my design of taking the black
veil-I presume I must have told her of it myself;
and one day she tofd me, that she had sometimes
thought of becoming a n~n, but still felt but little in·
elination that way; yet she requested me to do her
the favor to inform her how I was pleased with
that mode of life, after I should have been in long
enough to form an opinion. If I thought she would
be happy as a nun, she desired I would frankly in·
form her; and if not-as I was acquainted with her
disposition-that I would warn her against it. •We
often conversed on the subject afterwards; and it
was repeated, and plainly understood between us,
that I was to tell her the exact truth, as she would
probably be guided entirely by my opinion in the
courso she would adopt.
I went through many preparatory steps before my
56 BLACK NUNNERY.
admission, as I have mentioned in my first volume,
took the veil, and passed through some of the scenes
which I have before spoken of, before I ever particu-
larly reverted to the request of Miss Ross, so f.u as
I now can remember. One thing, however, I here'
stop to mention, which l omitted to say in my first
volume, and which I might forget hereafter, viz:-
that sooit after my admission as a "Received," the
Superior gave me the charge of her room, that or
the old nuns, and the adjoining community-room;
and thus kept me foi' about three months in a degree
more separate from the other nuns, than I should
l
otherwise have been. 'l'.his brought me more into
intercourse with the Superior, and in the same pro-
portion made some other nuns regard me with jeal-
ousy.: for some of ~~em occasionally, in some way
or other, would express dislike towards me. Per-
haps this state of things the more disposed me to
confide in the Superior.
After I harl been a nun for some weeks, I cannot
tell ~xactly how long, I rer.ollect that as I lay awake
one night, I began to think of Miss Ross, and to re-
call the conversations we had held together in the
novices' apartment. All at once it occurred to me
that I might probably do a great benefit to myself.
an honor to the nunnery and to true religion, as
well as save her, by inducing her to take the black
veil, especially as she had so much property to add
to the funds. A~ the same time the thought present-
ed itself to my mind, that by so doing I should gain a
very ex~lted place in heaven for myself: for I had

already heard a great deal aaid, and had l(>peatedly
rend the aame in our book, that to bring a person
into a Convent, was one of the highest kinds of mer-
it. I soon made up my mind to communicate to the
Superior all I knew; for although I questioned at
once whether it would not be shameful and sinful to
betray the confidence of my friend, this was easily
got over, by the thought of the vast benefits to result
from it, especially to herse)£
The next day I told one of the old nuns that I
wished to speak with the Superior : for as this was
commonly required, and nuns could not go into h~r
room without leav-e, I conformed to custom. I was
soon· admitted, when I told her all Miss Ross had
said to me, and added, that I wished to bet her to
take the veil. I apologized for my private conver-
sations. She said tfiey were perfectly justifiable.-
! think I never saw the Superior express more sat-
isfaction than she did on the receipt of ti1is intelli-
gence. · She appeared overjoyed; listened to all I
had to say with great attention, and highly appro-
ved of my proposition. When I informed her of
Miss Ross's attachment to young , she repli-
ed thnt that might explain the state of her mind ; for
the old nuns had for some time spoken of her de-
pressed appearance, and she had mentioned at con-
fession that something lay very heavy on her mind.
The Superior appeared from that moment to de-
vote her whole atten:ion to the consideration of the
subject. She seemed for a time almost lost in
thought; and remarked to me," We must consider·
58 ULACK N11NNERV.
this matter; we must consider the best way to bring
her into the nunnery : for some persons are harder
to get out of the devil's power than others. After
a little time ehc, LOld me I should be sent to read tho
lecture to the novices, and she would tell the old
nuns to allow me to converse with Miss Ross, which
they would not let me do, as I well knew, without
her express orders, as it was con,rary to the rules.
She then told me many things to say to Miss Ross,
and some of her instructions she repeated to me, so
that I might not be at a loss when I should converso
with her, no matter what objections she might raise.
Among other things which I most distinctly re·
collect, she told me to assure her, that as to the hap·
piness of a Convent, no person could possibly be
more happy than nuns; for there we were assured
of the favor of God, and of.heavenly enjoyments af.
ter death; tha~ while in the world, other young wo.
men would draw us off from our duty, and occupy
our minds with thoughts that would do us harm:
there we were exposed to no such dangers. The
sinfulness of vain thoughts. might ap}> )ar to us very
trifling, but it was very different in the sight of God;
and how could we hope to resist the temptations
surrounding us in such a manner in the world~
~f she made any allusion to her attachment to the
young man before mentioned, the Superior told me
to declaim against it, as an abomination to think of
such a thing in the nunnery; that I could not con.
verse with her if she spoke of it again, as not a.
.~roper person. If she appeared to heSitate at my

proposition, I was to tell her solemnly, that my offer
was a direct invitation from Jesus Christ to become
his spouse, which could not be rejected without
great guilt.
'l'he Superior told me that I should be richly re-
warded if I succeeded. She thought I would soon
be madn nn old (or confidential) nun; and she would
give me a most precious relic, with a piece of the
heart of Mary Magdalen, and intercede for me with
the Virgin.
After I had listened attentively to all these in-
structions received from a woman to whom I looked
with unbounded respect and veneration, I left her,
prepared to put them into practice to the best of my
ability, much excited with the hope of accomplish-
ing what I thought a truly great and meritorious
act, and one that would ensure the salvation of my
friend. ·
The reader may perhaps here recall the disclo-
:eures I have heretofore made, of the crimes I had
witnessed, and the sufferings I had undergone before
this period of my convent life, and wonder how I
could pol:lsibly have been so far deluded, as really to
believe what I was thus pr~pared to say. Such,
however, is indeed the truth; except that I must
.allow, that my conscience repeatedly disturbed me,
and seriously too, with the suggestion that I shoula
be guilty of direct deception, if I said, either that I
was happy in the Conv~nt, or that I had at all times
unshaken faith in any of the dc.!larations I was
about to make. More than once, too, I was shock·
BLACK NUNNERY.
ed ,at the idea of deceiving ·my confiding young
friend. But as I believed what I.had been so often
taught, about the virtue of deception in certain cir-
cumstances, I did my best to smother my scruples.
The promised arrangements were made by the
Superior; the old nuns were instructed not to inter·
rupt any conversation they might witness betweeu
Miss Ross and myself, and I was directed, at the
api"ointed hour, to read the lecture. I thus easily
found the opportunity I sought, and was soon with
Miss Ross, while the old nuns appeared very busy
in another part of the room, and unobserving.
Though under a repeated promise to reveal to her
the state of my mind, now that I had been lor.g fa.
miliar with the secrets of the nunnery, I most cnu·
tiously guarded myself, and assumed what did not
belong to me-the appearance of one devotedly fond
of the institution.
- I •told her that I had now been loi!.g enough a
"Received'' to be able to express an opinion; and I
must inform her that we lived a most happy life
within the institution; that I would urge her, as·a
friend, to take the veil, and withdraw from that
world which was so full of temptations. To this
she lent a very serious ear; and I saw that my
words produced a solemn and saddening effect upon
her feelings. She replied that she felt quite undeci·
ded what to do. She seemed solicitous to be still
Ja.rther assured of the happiness I had spoken of as
enjoyed by the nuns.

exactly.after the manner directed by the S~riot,
.and speaking rather harshly, inquired of hel1 "Do
you condemn the life of a mm then~, She instantly
answered, "No;'' and she ensily admitted all I said
about the attention paid to the comfort of those in
.the Convent. "But,11
said she, "my mother is very
much opposed to my taking the veil; she is a wid·
ow, and you know we are bound to honor and obey
ou:r parents-nature teaches us that.'~ The Supe·
rior had furnished me, in French, with an answer
to ~his objection ; and as we were accustomed to
converse in English, I. had only to .translate her
words, which were,
" Les droits de nos :>arens ne sont pas davant les
droits.de notre religion."
" The claims of our parents are not before those
of our religion.'' '
" I shan't be a nun P' said she, with determination.
I talked with her, however, some time, and she h&
gan again to listen patiently.
I then added, that Christ had commanded us to "for·
. sake father and ml,thcr" to be his discipl'esr- and that
we must have trials and tribulations before we could
enter the kingdom of heaven. She told me that she
felt then less inclined to the world'than sne h~.d.whe!4
we .had last conve1sed together ; but at le.1g1h she
alluded to Mr.--. "Never mention/' I exclaim·
. ed, " sucn abom.inations i It is sin, it is defilement
to . speak of such a thing in so holy aplace as a
Convent." This I said very w.uch in the mannl·r ·
and tone which the Superior had used in dictating

it to me. I then added, "Now this is the only ob-
stacle which the devil puts in the way of your sal·
vation-and see how he tries more to prevent you,
the nearer you are getting to it. All that you have
to do, then, is to resist the more." '·
And the repetition ofthese expressions has brought
to my mind many others which I often heard, not
only about that time, but frequently before and after·
wards. One brings up another ; and to speak .of
objections that might be made to any of our nunnery
doctrines, or to hear a question asked about our way
of ~ife, naturally calls to my memory the replies
which were made to them.
"Are you at liberty to buy a farm, and sell it
when you please~ No-Then how can you give
yourself to a young man when you please~"
"Must we not obey our parents ~-Quand les

[" When the rights or claims of religion are con·
cerned, the rights (or claims) of nature cease/']
When the question is put to an old nun-" Wha·
made you become a nun~~~ the regular, fiJred answer
always is, with a peculiar drawl-" Divine lOYe." '
But such things as these, although they come up
very strongly to my mind, may perha~ appear to
be not worth mentioning.
The conversation I held with poor Miss .Ross
was much longer than I can undertake to give a

that if she rejected it, it wou]d be a sin of deep in-

room; where I informed her of all that had passed.
She appeared very much delighted, and treated me·
with great condescension and kindness. She said,
however, that we should yet have to do much; for
it was plain to her that the novice had very strong
scruples to overcome--and she added, that the dev-
il's influence was very powerful over some persons.
We must therefore pursue a plan which would re·
quire great caution and skill on our part, but which,
she had no doubt, would prove successful. This
she communicated to me in few words. That even-
ing the Superior told the nuns that she had been
warned in a dream that some one was in great temp·
tations, and desired them to say a Pater and an Ave
for her.
We were to disgnise ourselves, and appear to Miss
Ross, I as Satan, and she as the Holy Mother.

struction~, I had better relate what was done in con-
formity with them.
When we were prepared to go through with,our
parts, in order that we might become familiar with
them, she ,gave me an old robe, which she. made me
wrap around me, and the devil's cap, head, and
horns, which is kept to scare the nuns, few of whom
know of it. 'l'hus I was concealed, every thing ex-
cept my eyes, and then approached a s:pot where we
imagined the novice to be lying. I addressed her
in a feigned voice, and invited her to become iny
servant, promising her a happy and easy life. In
an instant, at a moment when we supposed her to be
making the sign of the cross, I stopped speaking,
and hastily withdrew. A~er a ~hort time, I return-
ed, and made other propositions to her; and then,
after flying again from the cross, again ~arne back,
and promised her, in case she would comply, to
ensure her marriage with the man she loved. I
then retired once more; after which, the Superior
approached·, and w:ith as sweet and winning a voice
as she could assume, said that she had listened to
what had passed, and had come to assure her of her
protection.
After I had become familiar with my part in this
sad farce, and acted it to the s~tiofaction of the Supe-
rior she took measures to have it performed for the

last time. In this also I had a principal part to per·
form; for I was directed to hold another conversa·
&ion with my deceived friend ; and, in obedience to
'llStru:.tions, on Saturday evening took her into the
Examination of Conscience room, and informed her,.
that I had been inspired by the Virgin Mary to tell
her, that if she would go into the nuns' private
chapel, the Holy Mother would speak with her.
I informed her, however, that it would not be at all
surprising if the devil should appear to her, and en·
deavor to prevent her from holding so happy an
interview ; and that if she should be tempted, she
must cross herself, and Satan would instantly leave
her, because he could not withstand the power
of the sign. Then telling her that she must keep
a strict fast on Sunday evening, I informed her,
that on Monday morning I would be with her
again.
In the mean time, the Superior, With the help of
one of the old nuns, Saint Margarite, and myself, had
darkened the private chapel as much as we could,·
by means of black curtains, and placed only a sin-
gle light in it, and that a taper, burning by the side
of the altar. We also took down the cross, and laid
it on the floor, with the head turned towards the
door, and the foot towards the altar. When all was
prepared, I went to Miss Ross, and conducted her
into the chapel. I told her to lie down upon the
cross, with her arms extended, in the attitude of
the crucified Saviour, which she did; and then bound
her eyes tight with n bandage•. all just as the Supe;.

rior had ordered, telling her she might otherwise
see a horrid sight. I then retired by the door, just·
outside of which, the Superior was standing; and
there I was covered with the old robe; for although
It was so dark, the eyes of the poor girl were blind··
ed, and her head purposely so placed, that she could
hardly have.seen us under any circumstances, yet
the Superior said, perhaps she might peep a little
and see us.· If this plan failed, she said, she mus~
reson to some other.
W9 were both completely disguised ; and I
had not only the dress on, and devil's cap, but
a slice cut from a potato, and slit in different ways
so as to resemble great teeth, which was crowd·
ed into my mouth. The front part of my cap
had been turned up inside, and I painted my
cheeks with some red paint the Superior -gave
me; and she afterwards put on more, thinking I
had not enough.
After I had left Miss Ross in the chapel about a.
quarter of an hour, the Superior signified that it was
time to return, and begin my temptation. I there-
fore approached her, and standing a little distance·
from her head, repeated some of the words I had·
been taught; and the circumstances· are still most·
distinctly·before me, so that I remember the words
as if I had uttered them only yesterday. Per·
haps one reason of it is, that every few min.
u.tes during the whole time, my conscience stung·
me severely, so that I could scarcely go on · with
lilly part. /'

She raised her hand, without
speaking, and made the sign of the cross, saying,
11
Jesu, Maria, Joseph, ayez pitie de moi." (Jesus,
Mary, Joseph, have pity on me I) I waited no
longer, but immediately retired softly, as if I had.
vanished. After standing a few minutes beside the
auperior, just outside of the door, without either of
us speaking, she touched me, and I approached the
poor novice again.
'i Would you not like to come out of this place,"
I asked her, "and serve me 7 You shall bave
nothing but balls and pleasure of all 7-inds." .Miss
Ross made the sign of the cross again, and I van·
ished as quickly and silently as before. In a short
time I entered again, and told her, 11
If you will only
leave this nunnery, I will do any thing for you
you wish-! will get you married to the young man
you love so much.''
Still the poor unsuspecting girl, though doubtless
terrified, made the sign of the cross again and again;
and at length I left her saying "Jesu, Maria, Joseph,
ayez pitie de moi.'' I then took oft' my dress, when
~e Superior made me sit down, and signified that
l;must not make the slightest noise. She remarked,
~ W~ll, if this plan does not succeed, I will try force."
She then went in and addressed her, in French, in
this manner :

are, you must join the sisters this week, and make.
your vows before another Sabbath passes over your
head ; for I am afraid the devil is making great

I think you will be safe."
She then asked her if she was willing to give up
all she had to the Holy Church, and told her, that
unless she would part with all, she could not accept'
her. She then promised. her her protection, if she
was willing, and retired saying, "Peace be w' ~
you.''
In ·the afternoon I was sent to request her to go
into the Superior's room, as she wished to speak·
with hflr. On t>ntering it, we found the Superior·
of the Convent and the Superior of the Seminary·
both there. The former addressed her, tel!i:ng her
that she had had a vision, in which she was told·
that the young novice who- was doing penanee in
the chapel, was acceptable in the sight of God. At·
this, Miss Ross appeared quite &verjoyed, but scarce·
Jy able to speak.
The Superior then told her, that she ought to list-
en to any advice I might give her, for she had entire
confidence in me, nnd she ought to be guided by my
counsel. She requested her to return to the novices' ·
department, retire into a corner, and determine what
she would do. She then whispered to me, and de-
sired me to remain with her until the Superior of
the Seminary went away, wh1ch ! did. She then ..

told me to go to Miss Ross again, ~nd coax her to
be received almost immediately.
I went accordingly, and endeavored to get a prom
ise from her to that effect, but I was unable. She
persisted that she must see her mother before she
could take the veil. I iuquired of her the reason.
She replied, that she wished to give to the nunnery
all the property her mother could spare her. This
I communicated to the Superior, who told me to say
that .her mother should be sent for the next day.
Her mother came, and had nn interview with her,
in which she learnt her daughter's intention to be-
come a nun. This she opposed to her utmost ; but
a11 the arguments and entreaties she used, were
utterly vain--she could make no impression. Her
daughter had wished to see her only to tell her that
such was her resolution, and to request her to deliv·
er her that afternoon, all the money she intended
ever to give her. The witiow retired-th~ money
was sent-Miss Ross took the veil on the'Wednes·
4ay morning following, and brought o. large contri·
bution. I was not present at her reception ; and I
do not think it necessary to say any thing further on
o. subject, which is, and ever must be, all my life, on~
of the most painful with which I have had any con·
nexion. I will only add, that although I often saw
Saint Mel'y, (as she was called, after her supposed
patroness,) I never spoke with her after her .re·
ception. Opportunities, it is true, were not very
frequent; but, when they were offered, she re·

ONE of the nuns was from St. Mark's, and bore
the name of St. Mark. Her father visited the Su·
perior one day, and requested her to have the ~uns
pray for him daily for a short time, leaving with
her a considerable sum of money to pay for their
intercession. Such things were occasiona11y done
by different persons. He also sent about forty dol·
lars to his daughter, with a desire that they might
be distributed among the nuns, to purchase whatev·
er they might wish for. The Superior informed us
that it was quite inconsistent with the rules for the
nuns to receive such presents, but that, considering
the devout character of the giver, she would not en-
tirely forbid the execution of his request. She there-
fore furnished us with some molasses to make into
candy, and allowed us an unusual degree of liberty
d:uing a part of a day. A considerable quantity of
molasses was made into candy by some o( the most
skilled in the process : though by no means as mueh
as forty dollars' worth. The Superior, however,
had a trick played on her in cQnsequence of the in-
dulgence : for some of us attributed it to a desire of
pleasing the rich contributor, and not to any kind-
ness towards ourselves.

arrived, Jane Ray proposed to drop a little ·warm
candy in the chairs of tho Superior and two
old nuns. 1'his was soon done; and in a few min·
utcs those scats, as well as the others in the commu-
nity room, were occupied, and the prayers going on.
At the close the Superior attempted to rise, but fell
back again into her chair; and at the same mo·
ment the two old nuns did the same. After a few
unsuccessful attempts, their situation became evident
to all the assembly; and there was a great embar·
rassment at once among us all, arising from a dis-
position to speak and to laugh, opposed by the
endeavor to suppress both. The scene was a very
ludicrous one, and Jane enjoyed much amusement
before the Superior and the old nuns could be set
at liberty. · .
Jane Ray would' sometimes seem to be overcome
and lose courage, when detected and exposed for
some of her tricks, even though not condemned to
any severe penance. I have seen her cry, and even
roar, after committing some breach of rules ; and
then retire to a corner,-·and after composing herself,
begin to meditate a new trick. This she would
commonly carry into effect with success; and then,
laughing aloud, declare that she was satisfied and
happy again.
Sometimes she would submit to penances with per·
feet indifference, though they made her the constant
object of observation. To punish her for her habitu-
al negligence in dress, she was once ordered to
wear an old nightcap until it fell to pieces; but still

..he was seen again as usual, with her apron. half i>Q
nd half off, and with stockings of different colors.
She would occasionally slip into the Superior's
oom, steal pass tickets, and get into the hospital
.
.vith them; and this she did so boldly, that she was
the o~cnsion of the tickets being disused. Some·
times s~e would bring a Roman Catholic newspa-
per out of the Superior's room, and give it to the
~_uns to read; and sometimes repeat to us what sb~ .
had overheard said in private.
Sometimes scenes of great agitation wouid <x:cur,
·at"1(1 things would be cKrried to such a state, that one
and another of the n~ns would become desperate,.
and resist with violence. For it is to be remember·
ed, that unspeakable practices were sometimes resort-.
ed to, at the will of the priests or bishops, counte-;
nanced by the Superior; and sometimes, as I ha:ve
stated in my first volume, required on the authority.
of·the Pope.
Jane R.!ly sometimes appeared as a loud and via-
lent opposer of what were cons~dered the established
·T.Jles of the Convent. She would break ou.t in d~
nunciations of the priests, d'1d berate them in .a .style
wh~ch it would be diffic~tlt to imitate, if it were.
worth while. Other nuns wouldsometimes.exclaim.

lidPrable time she had her bed oppos1te mme, and
by watching for a moment. when she could do. it
without being seen by the night watch, she would
slip over to me, and get into my bed~ Thus we
have often spent hours together 1 and she found such
occasions very convenient for communicating to me
such plans as she devised.for amusement or revenge.
I sometimes lent an ear to her proposals, quite
. against my wiJl; for I commonly concluded with a
solemn confession of the wickedness, as I supposed
il, in which she thus induced, and sometimes almost
compelled me to engage. Indeed, it often happened
that I had nothing to do in the morning, as it were,
but to beg pardon; m1d when I was asked why !
had so much of that business to do, I commo=tly
laid it to Jane Ray., She, however, appeared to take
much pleasure in the stolen interviews we thus had·;
and when we were obliged to lie at a distance from
each other, she told me that it caused her to weep
more than she had ever done in her life.
I naturally felt much curiosity to learn something
of the history of Jane nay, and repeatedly asked
her questions intended to lead her to tell me soine·
thing of her family, her former residence, or life.
But, although so communicative on most other sub·
jeets, on this she evidently did not like to speak.
Repeatedly have I known her to waive my inqui·
ries, and many times, also, when I spoke very plain·
ly, she would become silent, and refuse to speak a
word. Ail this unwillinrucss, only served to in-
crease my desire to know the truth, but I never was

a~le to draw from her any thing more than a very
brief and general account of herself; for 'never, ex-
cept on a single occasion, did she comply with my
wishes so far as even to speak on the subject. ,
One night, when she had secretly left her bed
and entered mine, she happened to be in a very
communicative mood, though she appeared more de-
pressed and deeply sunk in melancholy than I had
ever known her before. She then informed' me,
that she had become attached to an officer of the
British army in Quebec, in whom she confided to
~er ruin, believing that he intended to :"Tlarry her.
She left her parents, and after a time proc~...ded with
him to Montreal. There he invited her to visit the
Hotel Dieu Nunnery, as a curiosity; but to. her
surprise, she suddenly found herselfdeserted by him,
and the doors closed upon her From what she
observed or heard, she soon learnt that this was don~
m consequence of an arrangement made between
the officer and the Superiors of the Seminary and
Convent, the first having paid a large sum of money
io have her shut up from the world.
I understood her to say that the officer was an
aid-de-camp of the former governor of Canada, Sir
Peregrine Maitland. The priests, she believed,
knew her story, but few of the nuns, she thought.
had any knowledge of it except myself.

CHAPTER VI.
My fear of the prleat-Ar&uments used to .lr.eep us In aubjcction---
Old DUDS.
I wAS kept in great fear of the-priests, by preten-
ces they made to various kinds of power. I was
once confessing to Father Bedar, who is now dead,
and told him I had something on my conscience
which I did not like to communicate. He said to
me, " I have power to strike you dead this minute;
but I will not. I will spare you. Go and examine
your conscience, and see if you cannot come back
and tell me what it is that you now conceal.11
I was much frightened; for I believed what ·he
18id, and supposed he could have taken away my
life on the spot by only wishing it. I therefore im-
;nediately \Vent to the examination of my conscience
with fear and trembling.
I have remarked in my first volume, more than
once, that we were told it was a duty to- :mbmit to
the lic>Jntious wishes of the priest~ This we were
urged to on various c~msiderations. We were told;
for instance, that being consecrated to God, we were
Bot our own, and eYen our persons were not to be
regarded aa at our disposal. Out of considerations-
elf gratitude, too, we were told, it was our duty to
auppress the doubts and misgivings which would
sometimes arise in our minds, when we allowed oar
(Onsciences to present' the 'natrtre·of Otir life·~ i~

own proper light. If thore were no priests, we wero
reminded we could never get to heaven ; and it
would be ungrateful in the extreme, after being in-
sured of eternal life by their kind offices, if wo
should deny them any wish whatever.
In spite, however, of all that was said, our feelings
often revolted, and arguments were rene·.ved. Not
only so, but now and then, as I have before remark-
ed, penances of different kinds were often resorted
to; to suppress them.
One of the tales told us by the priests, was this-
I~tcndcd to prove the power they exercise by means
of sacraments which none but they can administet
I recollect that it was recounted to us one day at
catechism, by one of the futhers.
u I was once travelling," said he, " in a desolate
region, when I saw something· flying like a white
dove. Believing it to be the Holy Spirit, I followed
it, and it led me to a house, over the door of which
it stopped. I went in, and found an old man on his
death-bed, who had never been baptized, nor ever
heard of any religion. I baptized him; and he went
off straight to heaven."•
• Among my early recollections, nre many anecdotes illustra-
ting the peculiar opinions and ceremonies of the Canadian
Catholics in and about Montreal. My grandmother,l\'Irs. Mills,
wa11 a Scotch woman, and a firm Protestant. She had a hand-
IIOme estate about four miles distantfrom the city, on the Lachine
road,where I repeatedly visited her. She wns required, like eve-
rybody else in the parish who wa» able, to furnish, in her turn,
what is called 11
holy bread," which is given out in church by
the priest before aacrament, but Mten afterwards. The prepa-
ration ofit was attended with much trouble and some expense 1

SEVEN &r.NS. 79
One reason why I did not like to approach the
cells occupied by the imprisoned nuns, was this:
the Superior had told me that they were possessed
by evil spirits, and that I must always make the
sign of the cross on going into the cellar. ·
There arc seven sins, as we were taught, which
priests cannot forgive, viz: that of refusing to pay
tythl's to the church, injuring dumb animals, setting
a house on fire, hearing a Protestant preach, rea-
ding Protestant books, and one more which I do
not remember. These, however, can be forgiven by
the Bishop or the Grand Vicar.
From what I heard and observed at different
time~. I had reason to believe that a serious mis-
for there were to be eleven loaves mode, ofdifferent sizes, though
they were all of considerable weight. They were made with a
good supply of eggs nnd'butter, and took nbout n bag of flour.
They were ornamented on the top with Peter's cock crowing,
having on his head n tinsel crown, and were starred over, in u
particular manner, which required great painstaking, and often
cost many trials befortl they would be done right. My grand-
mother used to say that it always cost her ten or twelve dollars to
prepare the holy bread; and the sacrifice of her feelings appear-
ed to be still more rcluctanlly submitted to; for she called it, in
her broad Scotch dialect, a service to the Dee'Dil.
She was a regular devout attendant on public worshtp;
notwithstanding her advanced age (above eighty) and the die·
tance from her church, in 1\'Iontrenl, she seldom or never failed
to attend, a1though in l'""scquence of certain unhappy circum-
lltanccs in her family, she could not for some years command
the services of the horses in the bnrn, and always had to walk.
I have lately conversed with 11 Protestant clergyman residing
in Canada, who 11poke in high h:rms of my grandmother, and
1aid he hod often overtaken heron the road home from church
in the !nO\V, and taken her up in hi8 sleigh.
After her death, the Roman Catholics dwelling in her neigh-·

understanding existed between the Bishop and Fa·
ther Richards. I have heard it hinted, in some way;
that the former would probably have had h1s resi-
dence in the nunnery but for the latter. But this I
state only as what I have been told.
The term "old nun," I did not particularly ex-
plain in my first edition. It did not refer entirely
to age. None of the nuns, indeed, were old women.
For some reason or other, none of them appeared
to me to be above forty years of age, and few more
than thirty. I never knew what made the differ.
qnce between them and the common veiled nuns.
like mysel£ It was el"sy to see that they stood on
a different footing from the rest of us, but what that
borhood held her memory in great dism·.e, and were not allowed
to pass over any part of her farm unitss they had holy water
about them, for fear of being beset by evil spirits.
A man I knew, whose name it is not necessary to mention,
the son of a Protestant mother, wished to marry a Catholic
woman, but knew he would be disinherited if he did so before
she dispotoed of her property. The priest al!owed them to live
together as man and wife, with the intention to be married at
a future time. When the neighbors began to talk about them,
the priest gave the woman permission to turn Protestant for a
time, and to be married by a Protestant clergyman, which wae
done by Mr. Black. Mter the dtJath of her mother-in-law, aho
threw off all disguise and avowed her Catholic sentiment•
again.
Asthis worthycouple lived in tho house ofthe parent, in accofd..
ance with custom they had to hsve the house blessed by a
priest, before it was thought to be proper or safe to inhabit it.
Accordingly the ceremonywas performt'd, ofdriving out the dev-
ils;. and a considerable sum of money was paid to the priest, :t
believe about a dollar for each window in the house. The man
(who appeared to have no rMl principle) had a priest on hie farm·

footing was I never could thoroughly under~tand.
They had a separate sleeping room, which I havo
described, and exercised much authority, not merely
in overseeing and directing operations in the nuns'
and novices' departments, but were allowed to in.
tlict various punishments without consulting the
Superior, and sometimes did punish with great se.
verity.
I sometimes imagined that there might be sonie
formal introduction to the dignity and authority of
an Old Nun, and that a highN grade existed, above
that of the "Received." It has occurred to me as
quite possible, (from what I knew of the difference
between novices and veiled nuns,) that "Old Nuns"
might have taken some peculiar oaths, and submit·
ted to rules of a special nature. All this, however,
ground, and to secure his crops from insects : for some of his
neighbora had persuaded him that it had been cursed in particu·
-lar spots where a Protestant minister had trodden, when he
visited it during th~Jlife of his mother, so that it was unfit to
produce the priests' blessed grain.
The ceremony of blessing ground and seeds is one very
commonly practised in those places in Canada, where I have
been. Before a farmer plants, he takes a handful of seed to his
priest, who blesses it, before it is fit to grow; and receives a
sum of moneyfor it, commonly, I believe, as many shillings as
there are grains. These are to be mixed with the rest of the
geed before sowing, and then you nrc sure of a good crop.-
\.t sowing time the pnests have often a good den! to do in this
.
vay, and receive much money. The farmers often pay them
n grain instead of money, which is commonly the best that is
o be had. I know that an uncle ofmine commonly bought his
eed wheat at the Seminary, because it was the best he could
·btain. The J?riests have in this wny a good deal of trade and
·-•"" to carry 011, as is well known in and about Montreal.
. 82 BLAOX NUNNERY,
I inferred only from their conduct, and the eon.
cert antl understanding which they appeared to
have with each other and the Superior. No fur-
ther light could I obtain on the subject; and
I am still as much in the dark as ever, although the
Superior once gave me much encouragement to
hope that I should become an "Old Nun."
Some of that class, as I began to say, were far
from being old ; and indeed a number of them were
below thirty years of age, according to my judg-
ment. As for their real names, families, or person-
al1history, I knew as little of them as others. We
called them, familiarly, Ma Mere (my mother,) or
Ma Tante, (my aunt,) and commonly obeyed them
without delay when they laid their commands upon
us.
I have no doubt, that, whatever was the process
by which "Old Nuns" are made, the reason of the
elevation of a " Received" to that dignity, is her su-
perior cunning. It was in consequence of my suc-
cess at imposture, that the Superior told me she
hoped I might become one ; and the old nuns whom
I best knew, were among the greatest adepts at du·
plicity I ever saw.

AxoNo the practices in the nunnery, is that of
shaving the hair of the nuns on their admission.-
Thisis done to most, but not all; as the hair of
some is more easily disposed in a manner thought
necessary to the proper arrangement of the head-
band and veil. My hair was shaved on my recep-
tion, and frequently afterwards. At the time of my
escape from the Convent, it was very short; since
when it has been growing, and it is now about six
inches long. We used sometimes to shave each
others heads, and I have done it for other.nuns.
It is a rule, that no novice shall be received.who·
is not in sound health. Miss Louise Bousquier, of
St. Denis, owed her escape from the life of a nun to
an affection of the head, on account of which.ahe
was discharged· from her noviciate when wjthin·
about three months of the period 'when she Would
have taken ..the veil.
Sometimes the.priests would come to the Superior
to borrow. money of her1 when she would show.lib-
erality towards some, but others l have heard her
blame for not paying what they already owed her.
In several instances I knew difficulties to arise from
money affairs.
84 BLACK NUNNERY.
One day I he~m! 11 C'JHversation between the
Bishop and the Superior of the Seminary about a
quantity of plate which an old lady, on her decease,
had bequeathed tfl the church. The Superior wish-
' ed to appropriate it to the expenses of the Semina-
ry, but the Bishop claimed it us his own. He said
he wanted a set of plate, and would have it sent to
his house for his own use. The Superior repli-
ed, that he could do that as soon as he had paid
the price which he could get for it at the silver
smith's. The Bishop asked him if he knew whom
he was talking to ; and things seemed likely to riso
to some height, when I left the room.
I heard a conversation, soon after my admission
as a nun, between the Bishop and the Superior of
the nunnery, in her room. The Bishop was com-
plaining that he could not get his proper dues from
the priests : for, as I understood, each priest is re-
quired to pay two English shillings out of every
dollar he receives, for his support in the Seminary;
while the whole of the profits of every high mass
fonhe dead, is considered the property of the Sem-
inary. The Superior of the nunnery replied, that
the ·priests would be better able to pay all their
debts if they did not gamble so much ; and the state
of the country at that time was unfavorable, and lit-
tle money was to be had. The Bishpp said he must
preach a sermon to the people, to make them more
liberal in their contrjbutions.
I saw a nun one day whose appearance struck
me in a singular manner. She was conducting a

priest through the sewing room, and had a large
bunch of keys, like an old nun. 1 could hardly
tell what to think when I looked on her. It seem-;.i
as if I must have seen her bcfo.re, and yet I could not
remember whP-n or where; and I had an impres-
sion that she could not be a nun. For some rea-
son or other which I could not understand, 1 felt a
great anxiety to know something about her, and in-
quired of Jane Ray, but she could tell me but little
or nothing. I then asked leave of the Superior to
speak with Sainte Thomas,-for that I understood
was her name.-She consented, on condition that
we should converse in her presence. I accordingly
addressed her : but, much to my mortification and
surprise, she replied very coldly, and showed at first
no disposition to interchange more than a salutation
with me. She soon, however, took an opportunity
to write something on a bit of paper with a pencil,
and to slip it into my hand, which I eagerly read
as soon as I could safely do so ; and there I found
an explanation of her conduct. She intimated that
she was unwilling to confide in the Superior, but
wished to see me alone the first opportunity.
We soon after had a secret interview, for one
night she stole into my bed, and we lay and.talked
together. She then appeared quite umeserved, and
perfectly cordia], and repeated that she believed the
.Superior was only a spy over us. We soon fo,und

had been in the Congregational Nunnery together,

street, and heard of her from some oile ; her family
being so wealthy, we had no intercourse in society.
She was from a place behind the mountain, where
her father, I believe, was a grocer, and a man of·
wealth. She had an uncle McDonald.
I learnt from her the circumstances under which ·
she entered the nunnery; and they were peculiar.
She had not passed a noviciate, but had purchased
her admission without such preparation, by the pay-
ment of a large sum of money, as she had peculiar
rea$ons for wishing for it.
My restless anxiety was thus in·a degree reliev-
ed, for I found that my impressions were right, and'
that St. Thomas was not a nun in the common·
meaning of the word; but, on the other hand, I
found l had been deceived in believing that all ad·
mitted into the Convent, had to pass through the
same long trial and training to which I had been
~ubject.
The·state of things in the nunnery cannot be ful-
ly understood, without a knowledge of the fact, that:
much iealousy always exists between some of tho-
nuns, on account of their preferences for particular
priests. And yet a priest once told me, that there

There was a nun who entrrt~ined a nry bitter

·She would sometimes get close by me on purpose,
while employed in ironing, or some other kind of
work which required us to be up, and in time of si-
.lence stand upon my feet, in order to make me
speak and get a penance. She once complained to
the Superior, that she saw me looking from a place
in the nunnery which she mentioned, and heard the
voice of some person speaking with me. Although
this was utterly false, the Superior thought I might
have so~e intention of escaping, and l!lentenced mo
to the most severe penance I ever endured-viz :
to live on bread and water for three weeks. This
diet appeared to reduce my strength ; and I suffered
more severely than usual from the kneeling posture
at prayers, which was always peculiarly distressing
to me, and made me almost desperate, so that I would
eometimes almost as readily die as live.

Man•
.' era of the Canadian Priests-Confessions of crimes by some of ,
the Priests-Story told by Aunt Susan, of her visit to a Quebeo
Nunnery-Nuns in Priests' dresses-Sister Turcot.
TnE priests who are natives of Canada, are gene·
rally very clownish in their manners, and often quite
brutish in their vicei!. The nuns would sometimes
laugh at ~eeing a Canadian priest from some coun-
try ~arish, coming in with a large piece of bread in
his hPnd, eating it as he walked. A large propor·
tion of the priests :ue foreigners; and a constant
intercourse appears to be kept up with France, as
we often heard of such and such a fathe.: just ar·
rived from that country. These are decidedly the
worst class. Most of the wickedness of which I
have any knowledge, I consider as their work. If
I should l'epeat o::te half the stories of wickedness
I have heard from the mouths of some of the
priests, I am afraid they would hardly be believed;
and yet I feel bound, since I have untlertaken to
make disclosures, not to omit them altogether.
It .
is not uncommort for priests to recount anec·
dotes of what they huve seen and none ; and seve·
ral stories which I have heard from some of
.hem I will briefly repeat.
A country priest said one day, that he knew a
priest in a parish better off than those of the Sern·
inary, for he had seven nun&all to himself.

daughters in Montreal, gro•,"-n up. Their mother
was a married woman. One of the daughters, he
added, now occasionally confessed to him, ignorant,
however, of any relationship.
Another said he was once applied to by a man
for advice, in consequence of suspicions he had of
his wife, and quieted his suspicions by telling him
a falsehood, when he knew the husband was not
jealous without cause, he himself having been her
seducer.
It may, it must offend the ear of the modest to
hear such exposures as these, even if made in the
most brief and guarded language tha.t can be used.
But I am compelhd to declare, that this is not all.
I shall stop here, but lest my readers should infer
that it is because the10 is nothing more that could
be said, I must first make the solemn declaration,
that tke're are crimes committed in tke Hotel Dieu
Nunnery too abominable to mention.
I remember a variety of stories relating to con-
fession, which I have heard told in the nunnery
by priests; who sometimes become very commu-
nicative when intoxicated. One of their favorite
topics is Confession. One of them showed a
watch, one day, which he said was worth a hun-
dred dollars. He had received it at confession, from
a fellow who had stolen it, telling him that he
must see it safely restored to the owner, while hi!J
intention was to get it into his possession to keep,
which he did, and boasted of what he had done.
I have known priests to sit and talk ~bout wl:;at

they had done in the Confessional, for three or four
hours at 11 time; and I have heard one give an-
other instructions how he might proceed, and what
he might C!o. One priest, I know, paid another fifty
dollars, to tell him what was confessed to him by
a young woman for whom he had a partiality, or
what he called love. Sometimes one will request
another to send a particular lady to confess to him,
either on account of her beauty or her property:
for considerable sums are in such cases obtained
from the rich.
In the country the common practice is, so far as
_ know, to fix the price of Confession for the year
at,some particular rate: as two bushels of wheat
out·of twelve; or if the person is not a farmer, o
~urn of money. ·
A priest one day said to another in my hearing,
You confess such a young lady, mentioning her
Bame. She does not like you, I understand, bc-
~-ause you kiss her. She is rich, and you have
more rich persons to confess than I think is your
share.
I knew a country priest, on a wager, drink a
shoe-full of wine. I was once near the priests'
parlor, (as I have called it,) when I heard two of
them in an altercation, about the speed cf two in-
sects; which led to a wager, on the question whether
that ir.sect would move quicker over a hot brick
or a cold o~~e. They told me to put a brick in the
cold, while ~hey heated one on the stove; and

AUNT SUSAN DISGUISED. 91
experiment~ This scene cauaed great excitement
nnd loud talking. I have mentioned it to give an
idea of the manner in which much time pusses in
the nunnery.
One day when I was employed in the hospital,
Aunt Susan came in, one of the old nuns, who had
been absent for several days, and just returned. The
circumstances which I am about to relate were
brought to my mind the other day, by reading in
Rosamond's book about the priests in Cuba taking
her into a monastery in disguise.
Aunt Susan was something like Aunt Margaret,
in having something the matter with her feet which
made her rather lame. I noticed something strange
in her appearance when she came into the hospital,
and found that she was unable to apply the cup in
cupping a patient for whom that remedy had been
prescribed, although she had been remarkably skil-
ful before, and now appeared to try her best. I
thought she must have taken too much wine, and
undertook t" perform the operation at her request;
which pleased her so well, that she sat down and
became very talkative, in a manner little consistent
with the rules and practicei:! of the 5nstitution.
She told me that she had jn~t r::~urned from Que·
bee, whither she had gone sor:i'l J ays before from
our Convent, on a visit to the Hotel Dieu Nunnery
of that city. She had ~~.:w;l) in the dress of a priest,
in company with some father, and had an opportu-
nity to witness the arrangement:3 and habits of that
ira&itution. She went on to mal{e remarks on dif
92 DLAC.K NUNKEllY.
ferent subjects which had come under her observa-
tion, while I was employed in operating on the pa·
tient. She represented the rules in the nunnery
which she had visited as less strict, or less strictly
regarded, than our own ; and said there was much
less order, peace, and quietness, than we enjoy. The
Superior, she said, had less command over the nuns,
and they were less orderly, and not so well content-
ed. She had a cousin there, as she informed me,
a Miss Durau~eau, who was very stubborn, and
unmanageable. If she were Superior, she decla-
red she would half murder her for her rebellious
conduct.
All that I knew about the story told by Aunt Su-
san, was what she told me. I did not see her in th~
dress of a priest, but I had reason to believe that.
the nuns often left the Convent in such a disguise.
and that this p~ut of her tale was by no means in-
credible. Indeed, during my stay in the Hotel
Dieu, I personally knew more than one case of the
kjnd.
There was an old nun, notorious in Montreal.
known by the name of Sister Turcot, her family
name. I was one day ernployed in the hospital,
when I saw her enter dressed like a priest, in com·
pany with one or two fathers. She spent a few
minutes there, during which she went up to one of
the patients' beds, and performed prayers instead of
one, and with such address that I should never have
suspected any thing irregular, I think, if I had not

the greatest difficulty that I refrained from laugh-
ing at a sight so ludicrous. She was at the time on
her way out of the nunnery, in company with the
·priests, and after a short tlelay left the hospital, and
went, as I supposed, into the street.
But I had still stronger evidence than thi3, of the
departure of nuns in open daylight, in the dress of
priests; for I was repeatedly called in to help them
put on their disguise. I have dressedthe nun Sainte
Felix, three or four times; nnd a hateful creature
she was, in consequence of her jealous disposition.
She was always thinking some one else a greater
favorite than herself, with some priest.
'rhe place where the change of dress was usu·
ally made was the Superior's room; and in the clos-
et in the adjoining passage, at the end nearest her
door, were always kept a number of priests' dresses,
nearly a shelf full; as well as several black-hood-
ed cloaks, like those worn by the Sisters of
Charity.
A priest once told me, that he had three nuns to
· take out of the Convent that day, and was troubled
to know how to do it. He had often taken out one
at a time, and had sometimes thought he might lose
them if they were disposed to run away. H e com-
monly directed them to limp as they passed along
the streets;-" for,'' said hP. "many of the priests
do so, and they might pass very \V

A vl1it to thl.' Dlahop's-My Recl.'ption-1\ly Occupations-The Bi•h-
op's Vislteu-Rcturn to the Nunnery.
ALTHOUGH it is a painful duty, I feel it incum·
bent on me to give my own experience, on the sub-
ject of disguising nuns as priests, that they may
leave the Convent unobserved.
The Superior one day informed me, that I WM
to pay a visit to the Bishop on the evening of the
next day. The intelligence surprised me ; and, as
no further information was given me, I did not
know exactly what to think of it. The period
of w·hich I speak might have been about a year
after I took the veil.'
On the evening appointed; I was taken to the
Superior's room, and furnished with a priest's
dress, which, in compliance with her directions, I
put on. Father Phelan, who was present, then
~onducted me ou~ of the Nunnery soon after dusk,
.according to my recollection. We passed down
towards my mother's house, across Notre Dame
street, and round Citadel Hill, till we reached a
house which 1 had never before· known for the
Bishop's, and stopped,at the door. No house ad·
joined it on my right. 'Ve rang ; and the door
was opened by the Bishop himself, which. greatly

ped and sat down. Supper was soon ready, which
was a rich one.
The room in which I was, was that in which I
remained during my stay, and the only one in the
house which I ever entered. It had windows look·
ing upon the street, but in the rear the remaining
part of that story appeared to be taken up with
dark cupboards, which I afterwards found contain·
ed clothes and other articles, in considerable num-
bers. There was a large staff, which the bishop
~aid was of solid gold, and cost seven or eight
thousand dollars.
After Father Phelan had gone away, the Bishop
invited me to play cards, which we did on that
and other evenings; commonly the game called
"catch the ten." The Bishop's table was set with
a complete service of plate, marked with two let·
ters, one was L. I spent a part of almost every
day in a small apartment or closet in one corner
of the room : for as there were commonly fre·
quent calls on the Bishop, when persons were ad·
mitted to that room, he chose to see them alone.
.The custom was, when any person called, for the
servant to give notice to him by ringing a bell t
and if he wished to have him brought up stairs,
he would ring one in reply; but if not, he took no
notice of it. There was a supply of excellent
wines and confectionary, in a closet in the large
room, which was always open.
During a part of my stay, I was employed in.

which he kept in an iron chest in the closet I have
mentioned. He told me that tho silver and gold
very soon became tarnished by lying there, and
that he found it necessary to have it cleaned once
a year. I should judge that he had ordered a nun
to be sent from the Convent, partly to perform this
task. He said that sometimes, when he had a
large sum of money to pay for land, he had felt
quite ashamed to give only tarnished silver and gold.
. I worked for hours at rubbing the coin, with
chamois cloth, to make it bright, and had to ar·
range it all with care upon a table, before put·
ting it away in the chest. 'rhe silver was prin-
cipally half dollars, which the bishop told me
to place in piles of six. The gold was kept in a
b!3autiful little box, and was quite tarnished, so that
he made me wipe it' over and over several times,
before he was satisfied with its appearance.
· Besides these, he had a large amount of money
in bank bills, princ.ipally of five dollars. These
he made me smooth out carefully with a hot iron,
which was brought to the door. When that was
done, I put them in parcels of fifty bills each. The
iron chest was studded, and locked itself when the
door was closed. While I was astonished at the
quantity of money I handled, I observed that I
was closely watched by the Bishop ; so that, if I
had wished, I knew I could not have taken any
of it without discovery.
Priest Bourgette was the most frequent visiter
at the bishop's during my stay, but he never saw

eight times a day. Father Phelan also came of·
ten; but generally during the bishop's absence,
who rode out every day. " 7
hencver the bishop
went out he locked the door and took away th'e
key ; but when Father Phelan came in his ab·
sence, he opened it with a key of his own, as I
suppose unknown to the bishop. He repeatedly
inquired of me what the bishop had said about
him ; and seemed very anxious to ascertain wheth·
er he stood high in his estimation or not. F ather
l
Tombeau or Tabeau, also had a key, and some·
times used it, but, I believe, with the bishop's
knowledge, although he never happened to see
me there.
The partition of the little room, or closet, was
so thin, that I could dist'nctly hear conversation
held in a considerabh: part of the great room.
Tombeau came in one day and said to the bishop,
I have'had a good day at confession, (with something
like an oath,) throwing down a quantity of money
on the table. 'l'he bishop replied, that so it ap·
pear-ed, and gathered it up. On another occasion
he·came in at evening, and said, "Well, I.am go·

One· day a number of gentlemen came to see

whom I had often seen from a child. He remain·
ed a considerable time after the others were gone,
and then I had to listen to the most vile conversa·
tion that I ever heard.
Persons came in at different times to confess ;
but as the bishop seated himself at the other end
of the room, I heard little or nothing of what they
said. One day a W'Jman came in who called her-
self Mrs. Green, of Montreal, and made a long
complaint against :ner husband for ill-treating her.
I got a sight of her face through the keyhole,
and found her quite handsome. This woman had
a dog with her, which caused some annoyance by
barking. She afterwards called several times;
and once, I think it was on her third visit, was ac·
companied by another woman, whose voice I
thought I recognised as soon as I heard it. After
~ little time I ascertained to a certainty that I was
not mistaken ; but the discovery was one of the
most painful I ever made. She confirmed the ac·
count the woman had given of the conduct of her
husband, and afterwards conversed with the bishop
on other subjects; for she remained there probably
not less than an hour and a half. The bishop
told her, that the next time the Governor carne to
town, he wished her to get him another interview
with him, to which she replied, that she always
did what she could to oblige him. T hey had also
a long talk about some furniture, which she had
lent him, and never received back. He said h~

had sent it baek to her at the Government
House.
The reply which the bishop finally gave to Mrs.
Green was, that she need not live with her hus·
band, but that she must confess·to him daily. He
afterwards told me he would not have had me seen
by one of those visiters for any thing in the
world.
Soon after I came to the bishop's, I found that
he was finishing the composition of a hymn, which
he was making, to be sung to a war song, begin·
ning with these words :
"En allant, marchant, contre lee canons,
A travers des feux, des feUlc: des battaillons."
He had the papers by him on which he was
writing it, and would often sing a part of it over
and over. I will give from memory a verse or
two, of the seven or eight of which it consisted,
and most of which I might recall, as I have since
heard it repeatedly sung in the Convent.

I eoon became extremely weary of staying in
that place, and asked for permission t<' return to
the Convent: but it was not allowed me until I had
been there about twelv~ or thirteen days. Much
apprehension was expressed lest I should be dis·
covered on the way; but at length, the arrange·
ment~ being made, and.I dressed again as a priest,
left the house with Father Phelan, and walked to
the nunnery, which, bad aa it was, I was glad
to see.

A REGARD to truth requires th!lt I should not
charge other persons with assuming the office of a
priest, without admitting that I have done so myself,
if 'my testimony is neces.3ary to convince my re~d·
ers that such things are ever done.
Early one morning, Father Bonin t0hl me that
h~ was quite indisposed, and felt unable to perform
the task of confessor in the church, which devolv-
ed upon him, and he thought I might take his place,
and go through the cP-remony without being dis-
covered. The priests have often expresser! in my ,
hearing a dislike of sitting for hours in the confes-
sional box, as a dull and wearisome task ; but Bo-
nin appeared at that time to be somewhat indisposed,
and offered to tell the Superior if she asked for me.
I did not make any serious opposition to his propo-
sal ; and he went on to give me instructions how to
proceed.
He told me that I must first put on his clothes
and gown, and cover my head with his hat, and •hen
proceed to the church through the subterranean
passages, enter the first confessional box by the chap·
el of Saint Magdalen, near the high altar, with all
the familiarity I could assume, take my s~at, put on
a little cap which I should find there, cover my face
with his handkerchief which he gave me, and pro·

ceed as I should think proper with such persons ns
should present themselves, remembering to speak
in a feigned voice. Particular instructions were
necessal'yto enable me to find my way to the chul'ch;
nncl i:e told me first to go through the subterr.am;an ·
passage leading into the cellar of the Congrtga·
tiona! Nunnery, then turning a corner a few steps
distant from the door, descend into another and fol~
low it to the end. There I should find a iight trap·
door, which I could raise with my head. This
would admit me into the sacristy of the church,
from which to my station the pu.ssage was duect.
J...fter reccifing such instructions in haste, though
nt ·greater length than I have given them here, and
having dressed myself in his dothes, I set out on
my errand; but the garments were so much too
large for me, that I founJ some difficulty in pro-
eeeding. I went down into the nunnery cellar, pro·
ceeded to the farther end of it, opened the low door
to the subterranean passage I was first to enter, and
soon reached its extremity. Following my direc~·
tions, though still in almost total darkness, I group·
ed my way round a corner of a stone wall, and
found a staircase, (I think of eleven steps,) down'
which I cautiously proceeded, then, by putt!ng ,up:
both hands, so as to touch both sides of the passage
to which they led me, I found my way along .with·
out much difficu1ty, except what arose from the siz~:
and weight of my dress. I had two falls in conse.·
quence of this ; but, not receiving any injurY., after'
a pretty long walk. I saw two or three streaks of

light above, and mounting a few steps, I found the
trap-door of which I had been informed. fressil}g
my head again:~t it a little, it easily rose, and I e~­
tercd an apartment above ground.
At the time when I left the Hotel Dieu, it was
scarcely daybreak, but the light was now so much
stronger, that I could distinguish objects with clear-
ness; and, proceeding at once towards the high al-
tar, and the cha.pel of Saint Magdalen, I made for
the first confessional box. There I saw a number
~f per~ons of ditferent descriptions, kneeling, on
b~Jh s~des of the box, engaged in preparing for
~or.fession ;.but I walked with as firm a step, and
~~ air of as much unconcern as I could, kneeled
~efore the altar, and said (or appeared to say) a
p~·ayer, then entered the box, closed the door, and
(~ok my seat on the little narrow bench on which
t\1,~ confessor sits.
But by this time my feelings had materially
.~hanged; l found myself in a place from '!hich I

10.that a trembling came over me. I leaned my
head upon my hand, and for a few instants heartily
wished myself out of a place which I still regard
ed as sacred.
All these thoughts, however, passed through my
mind much more rapidly than I have described
them. I had hardly time to sit down by the lattice
work, cast a glance through it about the church,
and reflect, that although a confessor can see every
thing from his box, he is himself in the dark, and
entirely concealed from all inspection, when I heard
a low and mournful voice murmuring in my ear-
" Mon pere, benissez moi, parce que j'ai peche!'
These words, with which confession commences,
'
came from an old man, who had earliest taken his
place by the confessional box in the morning, and
who, according to general custom, was entitl~d to
the first hearing. I let him run on with his story
without interru.ption, and was glad that he made it
lonO', as I dreaded to trust myself to speak. He
0 . .
said, "I have performed the penance which you
laid upon me, and I have sinned but once since my
last confession, when I got into a passion with my
wffe. But you ought to know what kind of a crea-
ture she is, and how impossible it is to get along
with her in peace.'' He at length brought his tale
to.an end, and then, to my surprise, asked me for
absolution. Up to this time I had not opened my
lips, ~nd did not like to trust my voice, even in the
lowest tone; but the thought of being called on to
bestow absolution, ignorant as I was of the Latin
.06 BLACK NUNNERY.
to;rm which I knew was necessary, although I had
heard it repeated, was dreadful to me. I thcref?r.e
$poke in a rough voice, and told him he must per·
form a penance for the sin he ha:l committed in be-
ing angry with his wife, by saying five acts ofcon·
trition and five Ave Marias that night on his knees
by his bedside, and repeat the same the next day,
nfter which he might come again for absolution.
The old man then rose, and sorrowfully went
away; while a young hd who had been long \vait·
ing next him on his knees, pushed up as close to me
as he could get, and began to tell his "futher11
hol~'
he had got into a dreadful predicament, through the
enmity of a woman who was disposed to do ~im all
'the harm she could, although she had an interest·
ing daughter for whom he had the highest respect.
He sai,
d that the mother was then in the church,
.having come to confess and accuse him; and he be-
lieved she had done so already. He then went on
to tell the particulars of the circumstances attend-
ing his case, and how a little act of civility and
kindness which he had shown the young lady,
had been misrepresented. He said he had come
Jtoping to get some indulgences that morning, but
feared that he should be refused. I replied that
~hat was out of the question until some future time.
He then-asked for a penance. I had become quite
amused by his foolish talking, and npw.asked who
lived in the house of the old woman ; and on learn·
ing that there were several persons, told him he

the family. He replied that he·could not do that ;
but r insist'ed that he could not be let off from such
an act of self-denial.
A~er this boy had gone away, a woman came up
and held- up to me a handful of silver, saying she
lmd told 'a great many lies tfJ her mistress, (she was
1 servant in a house in the city,) and had brought me
three dollars, mostly in British shillin~s. to pay for
high mass, which, she said, she thought would pro-
cure her forgiveness for the whole. She handed
the money to me, and i took it, telling her her
wish should be granted.
A young country girl afterwards presented her-
self, with a long story about a trick she had tried;
to find out whom she was to marry, and the fear
she had that the Devil had appeared to her. She
l:ad gone about dusk to a bridge, on the advice of
her mother, and thrown one of her garments to the·
opposite bank of the brook, when a young IPan·sud-
denly appeared, and restored it to her. He had in·
deed th-J form of a good young man she knew, but
she thought perhaps it m~ght have been· the·Evil
One in his shape. I'told her she had been guilty
or'sacrilege, ·in having any thing to do with such
tricks; and laid a penance upon her which 1' am '
sure she must have found both difficult and vexa- ·
tious, saying that I could by no means forgive·her
until she should have performed it. "My f.'lt.her,''
elie exclaimed, "but don't you remember what you
forgave me last year1 and· yet it w'ns .Something
worse than what I have now confessed., I reoli~

thnt this caae wu rather a difficult one, and I mUJt
e<?mmunicate with the Bishop before I could give
an answer. I
After this a woman took her place at the lattice,
and began a confession of a nature not proper to be
repeated, disclosing a character which disgusted me
extremely. I was obliged to lie:ten in silence, for
I could not invent any way to interrupt her; but
was glad when she had done. I do not recollect
the order in which all appeared whom I confessed
that morning, and shall not attempt to give it; nei-
1 ther can I fix with absolute certainty the exact
num.ber.
One man told me he had come for absolution for
the sin of drunkenness, which he had recently com-
mitted. I told him to get drunk again daily, and
return at the end of the week, and he should be ab-
solved from all together ; for I thought from what
I had seen in the Convent that drunkenness was its
own best punishment.
A girl brought me a parcel of money which she
had stolen from her mistrees, requesting me to re-
store·it to her, and informing me that her mistress'
name would be found in the parcel. This I took,
and on her asking me to bestow absolution upon
her, I told her to do an act ofcontrition, and ventured
to say ~omething over in a low voice which she
could not distinctly hear, and making the sign of
.he cro::;s with my hand, I sent her off well satisfied
that she was pardoned. ·

words: " My father, I was unable to come when
you wished, but I have come now." Not knowing
why she had been sent for or directed to come, I
dismisse(l her, as I had done others, by telling her
to come at another time.
One fellow nskcd my permi8sion to give his fa-
ther a good beating; for he said the old man hl\d
conducted so of late, that he did not know how to
get along with him. He often took opportunity
when he was absent, to give away things in the
house; and he was afraid he would soon.strip it of
all it contained. He could not tell why he had
been seized with such a whim, but he thought that
a good whipping might very probably reform hil!l,
and he wished to know how much money he must
pay me for leave to do it. I inquired whether his
father really deserved such treatment. He replied
that. I might be sure he never would have proposed
it if he did not. I told him I could not give my
consent then, but directed him to come again.
An older man confessed things which ought nev-
er to be repeated, and not less shocking than those
before alluded to in speaking of the confession of
one of the females.
There were tw·o little lattices opening to the con-
fession box, as usual ; and sometimes I sat at one
and sometimes at the other, al·cording as the appli-
cants stationed themselves. The curtain always
fell as I left one side before I raised that on the
other ; alld the door being kept closed, Q.Rd every
other part being tight, I was su much m the

dark that I !mew I was invisible, nnd ran no risk
of detection from any thing thnt could be seen, even
if I had not kept Father Bonin's handkerchief con-
~:;tantly over my face. At the ~arne time, as I men·
tioned before, I could at any time peep through the
lattice1 and distinctly sec n great part of the church.
'Vhenever I looked out, however, I was distressed
to find that there were numbers of persons still
kneeling ncar the box, waiting their turns for ~on­
fession, so that, in spite of all I had listened to, I
saw no prospect of being soon relc:ased from my
uJ\pleasant situation.
One of those who addressed me, was a fellow
who slyly showed me n bundle, which. he told me
contained some jewelry that he had brought to give
me. He had stolen a quantity, he said, from n man
from wh01n he had before stolen four times since
his last confession, and had brought half of it to
me. I was quite shocked at his communication,
and shrimk from receiving the bundle, telling him
I could not at present determine what directions tG
give hint
The :ast person I confessed was a poor simple-
ton, who acknowiedged with great appearance of
eofitrition that he had eaten a piece of liver on Fri-
day. I felt by this time so weary of my business;
ahd so milch perplexed to find n way to escape from
my box, thnt I imswered him rather shortly, telling
,him to do a penance for the offence he had commit-
ted, the next time he ate liver, by putting on it an
cqtinl quantity of mustard. At this he exelnilncd1

saying there was never such a thing in his father's
house; and went away complaining that I was
mo!'e severe with him than at his last confe'3sion.
I had by this time made up my mind, thn.t it
would be folly to try any longer to confe~ all who
W')re waiting their turns; and that I mi~·ht as well
desert my post then as at any other t'me, for I must
go abruptly sooner or later, if I intended to ge~
away before noon. I therefore rose as the last men·
tioned fellow withdrew, nnd h.\Ving changed my
cap for t.he hat, in a hasty man:.,er stepped out of
the box, without saying a word to any of those
around me, kneeled a moment at the altar, and cross·
ed into the sacristy. Lifting the trap-door, I ,de-
scended into the passage, and made my way as fast
as I could in the dark, first to the cellar of the Con-
gregational Nunnery, then back to the Hotel Dieu.
Returuing to the Priests' room, I found Father Bo-
nin, to whom I gave an account of my proceedings,
while I exchanged his hat and coat, &c. fur my
nun's apron and veil.
The Superior was present, and when she heard
me say that a bundle of jewelry had been offered
me, and I had refused to receive it, f.he betrayed
strong feelings of contempt and anger, saying-
" Vous etes plus bete que je ne pensais."
(You are a greater fool than I took you for.)
And t!len she scolded me very severely for mis-
sing such an opportunity to get sometbing val-
uable.
I gave the English shillings 'vhich one of the

to eacap11 fr«,~m the Nunnery.
During the first appearance of the Cholera at
Montreal in 1832, I witnessed the death of Mr.
Bedar, a priest, who came to the nunnery· sick.
Whether he was conscience··struck, or not, I do not
know; but I never saw a mnn die a more awful
death. . I spoke to Father H.ichards about him,
saying, that I thought his faith must be weak, as I
was surprised a Christian man like him should
dread the approach of death.
Father Richards replied, that his mind was not
strong enough to bear with the joys which his spi·
rit re~eivcd hom another world. His spHt, he
said, was already in heaven. I had been called 'fo
sit up with him the night before, and I had set up
with him all night. At different times in the
night, he would ask for a crucifix, and then ·occa·
sionally would throw it from him, as if he. wa$
afraid to appear before it. At different · timce
in the night, he wished to speak to one of his
nieces1· who was a novice, before his death, which
was granted bim. He said to Father Richards,
that it was the last request he had to. xnake. aAA h;e

me to try to o\·erhear what was said, through the
door, which was not quite shut. He told me the
old man was so overjoyed that he did not know
~vhat he was saying.
I therefore stood and 1istened, when I heard him
request his niece never to become a nun, but to
leave the nunnery before a fortnight, which she
did three days after his death. I was a novice .at
that time, and it was but a little before I was re-
ceived. As I was preparing to become a Veiled
Nun, it struck me as very strange; but still I
thought, as Father Richards had said, that Bedar
\Vas so overjoyed with a view of heaven, that he did
not know what he said. I had witnessed the sick-
ness of one person before, who appeared to be like a
man in horror, and the recollection of it was
awakened at that time.
Mr. Savage, the priest, told me, after the death of
Mr. Archambeau, that while, on the evening be-
fore he died, he was praying for him in his room,
near the window, he heard a r.oise like singing
and instrumental music, which he could not at first
account for, until an angel appeared, and told him
that there was no moru need of praying, and that
:they were already preparing a crown in heaven to
.receive Mr. Archambeau.
Not very long after I took the black veil, the
Superior, on two occasions, remarked to me, that
·!ome nuns had parcn•.s so unwilling to part ·with
'their money, that in order to get it for the use of

the Convent, it was necessary to resort to e.xtraordi-
na: v mE>ans ; and that fear was sometimes the most
successful. Soon afterwards she told me to stop at
her room that evening on my way to bed. With
this I of course complied, and when I reached the
passage in which is the staircase leading to our
sleeping-room, with the procession of nuns, I left
them, and entered the Superior's apartment.
On her bed lay a singular object, something like
a rude mask. with holes cut for :~yes and mouth,
and painted in such a mannt>r as to appear quite
hideous. She informed me that she had need of
my services: for th·~re were two nuns, Sainte Mar-
garet anci Sainte Susan, (not the lame ~ainte Susa.n,
whom we called "ln. boiteuse,11
) whose parents
withheld money which the Convent ought to have;
and they must be fri-ghtened. One of these wo-
men slept on one side of me, towards the end of
the room, and the other on the other side, beyond
the staircase, and both at some distance from my
place. Th0 Superior informrd me, that she wish-
ed me to be disguised, to represent the devH, to
visit them in succession, and in a feigned voice to
urge them to withhold from the nunnery all the
money they could. She remarked, that if I should
·urge them to give to the Convent, they would of
course think it their duty to withhold; but, aq
·whatever came from the devil must be wrong, they
would probably act contrary to his ad vjce, what~
,ever it might be.
she then took off my apron,,let down my black

gown, took tho thing I have spoken of from her
bed, and placed it on my head. It proved to be
the shell of a pumpkin, hollowed out, shaped, cut
and painted; and it went over my head S\) as to
cover it entirely, and show an awful face in front.
She then repented her instructions to me; and the
time being elapsed when the nuns were probably
all in bed, and somo of them asleep, she sent me
up stairs to execute my commission. I mouqtect
to the sleeping-room, and slipping along ns quietly
as possible, found my way to the bedside of Sainte
Susan. She seemed to be dozing, for she did not
at first appear to be aware of my presence, but di
rectly raised her eyes and started with fright, then
crossing herself, looked at me with~ut speaking.
I addressed her, as l ·had been directed, in n
feigned voice, telling her that she ought by no
means to let !ler parents give any of their property
to the Convent, to a set of people so religious, but
to spend it in pleasure and dissipation, at the the-
atre, and parties. She crossed herself again and
again , and then I withdrew, passed along the pas-
sage, and turning in again, stood by the side of
Sainte Margaret. She was wide awake, and shrunk
from me as soon as I approached her. I repeated
my diobolical counsel to her, pretty nearly in the
same words, and after withstanding two or three
crossings, left her, and hastened down to the Supe...
rior, where I gave her an account of what I had
done, and !eft my mask, Rnd th~n returning quietly,
retired for the night.

A short time afterwards I learnt from her, that
the parents of the two nuns had been solicited by
their d:.u~ghters to make liberal presents to the
nunnery, and had given something, but so little
that the Superior was very much dissatisfied.
One night, sometime after this, when I was go
ing up to bed, the Superior called me into her room,
and told me she wanted me to frighten another nun
for her. St. Charles, she said, had been conceal-
ing something from her confessor for two or three
weeks; and the way to make h-er brin_g- it out,
was to terrify her.
I had some acquaintance with the nun of whom
she spoke. She was a young woman who had been
occasionally in the apothecary's room. and I haa
conceived a considerable regard for her. I did not
like the thought of doing any thing unfriendly to
·her ; but the Superior's will was not to be opposed,
and I was not accustomed or prepared to show any
backwardness in complying. She told me that I
was to disguise myself as the Devil, and, in his
character, urge St. Charles to persist in withhold-
ing her confession.
She then went to a cupboard, and brought out a
she~t, which she put round me, and a singular
thing, which, on being unfolded, proved to be a cap,
with lappets to hang down the back and over the
face. The former was black and the other white;
it had two cows' horns sticking out at the sides.-
This she placed upon my head; and after some in-
structiom '$ent me to the apartment in the common
t18 BLACK NUNNERY.
aleepiug room occupied by the young nun. I pro·
eeeded cu.utiously along, according to the Superior's
directions, stepped in, as I believe, unnoticed, and
took my stand beside the bed of St. Charles. The
light was feeble, and she could have had only an
indistinct view of her unexpected visiter. I instant·
ly perceived that she was extremely terrified. She
had only the power to cross herself and say, "Sainte
Marie, Joseph, &c. have pity on me." I however
staid near her, told her that I was pleased thai she
had resisted the persuasions of her confessor, and
~oped she would continue to disobey him. She.re·
peatedly crossed herself, and murmured over and
over her prayers to the saints for mercy; and at
length, presuming I had done enough, I withdrew,
returned to the Superior's room, was relieved of my
disguise, and permitted to go to bed. ·
The next day, as the Superior afterwards inform·
ed me, St. Charles showed great urgency to see her
confe~sor, and made a frank and full exposure of all
the sins she had so long and so obstinately conct!al-
ed. The effect of this scene, however, was as great
on my own mind as on hers, though in a different
manner. I never afterwards heard of the appeaJ;"-
ance of the Devil, or any evil spirit in the sleeping
room with any degree of faith. It always brought
fresh to my mind my personating him, and led me
irresistibly to conclude, that the Sqperior had.only
employed some other nun in my place. This I
have not the least doubt ~he repeatedly did. I feel
little less confident, however, that there were nuns,

and a considerable number of them too, who were
never so employed, and were not let into the secret.
The fep rs expressed by some of those who had
been visited by such spectres we~e too genuine to
leave any room for doubt. However, the impres·
sion wns kept alive in the Convent, nnd the fear of
evil spirits operated powerfully, I believe, on ma-
ny; nhd every now and then a new case of the
Devil's appearance would be reported, which was
commonly soon followed by prayers, said in the
presence of all, for the perseverance or greater ho-
I;ne~s of some nun under temptr..tion.
Among the persons with whom I ·became tl.c·
quainted in the Congregational Nunnery, was a
girl named Mulligan, or Milligan, who helped to
teach me bark-work, considerable quantities of
which are sold at the Convent, in Montreal, as vis-
hers well know. This branch of work, by the
way, is not very difficult to Ie·arn. The bark is
purchased of the furriers in the city, and worked in
the dry state. The porcupine quills with which it
is se\ved, are purchased already colored; and their
points are commonly touched with a little wax.
Miss Milligan spoke with somethihg of an Irish
accent, from -which I concluded that she had Irish
parents, being herself, I believe, a native of Upper
Canada. Her manners were rather reserved, yet
of a much superior order to those of many of the
women around me, so that I regarded her with pe·
culiar respect. I think her family must have been
uncommonly intelligent and respectable. She was·

in her novitiate in the Congregational Nunnery·at
the time I knew her.
During the time when I was employed in the
Hospital of the Black Nunnery, Father Bonin told
me the following story of events, which, I under-
stood, took place about the time when I was re-
ceived. This Mi~s Milligan, who had been for
some time a Congregational nun, being attached to
a man much older than herself, made her escape by
night, ran off with him into some adjacent part of
1 the United States, and was married to him by a ma-
gistrate. The priests, however, got an early alarm,
and Father Bonin, with some others, joined in the
pui'suit " 'Ve liked her so well," said Bonin,
"that we could not think of losing her. 'V'e would
rather have lost three of the flock than her." The .
couple were overtaken in a very short time after
their marriage, and the bride was brought back to
Montre:~l, and put into the nunnery again. There
she soon became, or feigned to be, reconciled to her
former situation, so that she was set free from all
uncommon restraint On the Sa-bbath, as I have
remarked in my first volume, the Congregationai
nuns often go in a procession to church. Miss'Mil-
ligan was allowed to join them, and was on her
way through the streets, when her husband sudden-
ly appeared, accompanit>d by two other men, and
seizing her, carried her to a. carriage, and attempt-
ed to take her off.
Father Bonin, however, interfered, as he stated,
and with some difficulty, assistGd by others, again

"eeovered. her. The husband then prosecuted the
priests, and a public trial took place, which result-
ed in their favor, it being decided that the marriage
was not legal, having been performed only by a
magistrate; and the poor man was obliged to pay
se'::eral hundred dollars to the priests. I heard
expressions made by some of them on receiving the
~oney: Tiley said they would have no objectioa
to having several of the nuns run away, if they
rould get as well paid for it.
Some years ago there was a priest who was put
mto the madhouse. I was not acquainted with the
reason at the time, out I have since learned from a
young woman who was in the Congregatioriall'fun-
nery about the period when it happened, that he ran
nway with one of the Congregational nuns. He
was taken a few miles from Montreal and brought
back ; and, for fear he would expose the dreadful
deeds done there, they put him into the madhouse,
and he is there, I believe, to this day.

CHAPTER XI.
Father T. U. Mc~laboil-Fint ncwll,.ctlonR of hlm-Hisllablte In tho
Nunnery-A Fight In tbe Prlc11t11' l'aa·lor-8imlla":' Occurrence11. ·,
I HAD an acquaintance with Father T. B. Mc·
Mahon before I r.tet with him in the nunnery. He
used occasionally to call at the Government
House. 'Vhen the Governor ·visited Montreal,the
priests sometimes wished to hold nh intervie\\ with
him in private, after tho public reception of cit11.ens
t
was concluded. McMahon once applied to m.'•
f!10ther, in some way to procurf' hin1 an interview,
and as it was obtained, he expressed much pleasure,
and some gratitude to her. They commonly were
a.nxious to get a sight of the rolis of officers, when
a ilew detachment of 'troops arrived from Eng-
land; and this cou.ld be done by making favor
with some one who could admit them intq the
Government House, where they were tlccessible.
The cause, as I understood it, was this: No Ro-
man Catholic is allowed to hold an office in the
British army; but those who renounce that reli-
gion are admitted. Such as have renounced it are
marked in some way on the lists; and those names
the priests used to get and copy off, that they might
afterwards visit the officers, and g~t them to attend
their church. Frcm what I saw and heard, I
judged that the priests supposed ~hnt many of them
bad renounced only that they might become of·
ficers.

f saw Father McMahon so often, anc\ heard of
him so much before I entered tho nunn~ry, that I
~t,~ppose I was about as well acquainted with his
character ns many of the citizens of Montreal ;
lind to those who have intelligence, and are fl .;e
froll\ bigotry, I would appeal for the truth of what
I say in the next paragraph. He was intemperate,
and often was to be seen lolling from side to side
~n a calache, when driven through the streets, by
one of his spiritual children, as .Qe called the man;
though ho was held in such repute for sanctity, by
many of tho ignorant Canadians, that they woul~
say he wa3 holding communion with God, and had
h.is spirit in heaven. He was sometimes complain-
ed of to the bishop. who would often let him off,
calling him the persecuted McMahon..
After my entrance into the VeUed. Department,
I often. s~w McM~hon's character displayed~ under
ev:en less di~guise. He was a gre:1t friend of the
Super~or, and spent much time in the indulgence
of his favoti~e vice, intoxicati.on, as he enjoyed
great freedom in .the nunnery. He often drank
l1imself fast asleep, and tlv.•n was accommodated
with a bed un,til he was able to walk. When he
was sick, too, and resorted to the "Holy Retreat,,
he was aHowod as much indulgen<;e as any of the
priests. This was the case at a period when h~
was confined there by two of the most loathsome
dis,eases known in the world.
I was more than once ordered by the Superio:r
to make punch for her an,d Fathei: Mr.Mahon; and

I have known them to drink until both wcro evi•
dcntly affected by liquor, indeed, to such a degre~,
as to present a disgusting appearance. Several of
the old nuns were also addicted to drinking. ! was
one clay directed by the Superior to go with an·
other nun, and lift McMahon from the floor to tho
sofa in her room. \Ve obeyed her orders, although
the task was a degrading one, under tho circum-
stances in which we found him. There he lay
and slept until towards night, when he awoke,
~roped his way to the Seminary, through the sub-
terranean passage, and came back in clean clothes,
in time to say vespers in the private chapel. And
this was not a solitary instance of a similar kincl :
for several times afterwards, I knew of his being
in a state not less discreditable to his morality and
'religious character.
In consequence of his influence with the Supe-
rior, he had authority to demand the best wines
whenever he pleased. These were kept, in consid-
erable quantities, in the first range of closets, in
the cellar next to the stairs, at the end ; as I well
knew, by being often sent to bring up some : for
McMahon has sometimes used a very · rofar•e ex-
pression, when demanding the best v:iue-- 16
Bring

to the blood of Christ.
There were many occasi«J:ns on which the
Pr1 ~sts' Pu.rlor was a scene of riot; more than one
in which they proceeded to violence. I was one
'day alarmed, by hearing the Superior direct au

old nun to go to the Seminary through thQ f?Ubter~
raneau passage, and cnll for help, as there was a.
quarrfll in the apartment. There was much noise
there; and when the door was opened, two priests
appeared, who had been fighting for some time, and
wore bleeding as if half dead.
The priests' room in the nunnery, was frequent-
ly thus disturbed by disputes, quarrels, and fight-
ing. 'l'he causes were different, and I generallY.
knew st. .ncthing of them, especially when I wa,
employed in waiting on the priests, as I have men·
tioned in my first volume. I wns often sent to
carry waiters loaded with refreshments and liquors
to the dfjor, where I would set them down, and' af·
ter knocking, retire. So when the priests wished
any thing :removed, they would set it outside, and
knock for me to come.
They would often get deeply.engage~ in gaming,
either there or in some other room; and I have
known them stake tha profits of their next mass-
.
play, and lose them. Afterwards. quarrels would
80metimes arise when the account was to be set.
·
tied; as the winner, perhaps, would claim that it
was to be the profits of a high mass. whilst the
loser would say it was a low one. Even after
such a question had been settled, the winner would
sometimes charge the loser with promising a high
mass, aud paying a low one ; and then high words
and blows would ensue.
On Saturday afternoons, the priests were accus-
tomed ~o assemble in their parlor, ,or private ~oom,
26•
126 BLACK NUSNERY.
in the greatest numbers-sometimes twenty or
1hirty of them would be thPre together, drinking
and gambling. One day the bishop came in with
a blac1.. eye, and a priest asked him how he had
got it, insinuating something, in reply to which
the bishop told him he lied. The priest answered
that he cared for neither bishop nor devil, and
toon struck at him, and knocked off his hat. The
Dthe"'s interfered; and when some remonstrated,
and explained the ooormity of the sin, the offend-
<.er, though half intoxicated, threw him<>elf upon
his knees and humbly begged pardon, promising.
to pay him all the fees he should receive befoie a
particular time, which he mentioned.
On another occasion, a party of seven or eight,
who were drinking together there, at an, entertain-
ment given by the Superior of the Seminary, fell
Jnto a terrible battle. The cause of it, as I gather-
ed aftetwards, was this : A song had been made
m ridicule of Bishop Lartigue, I do not know
when, by some of the American priests, with whom
he was not popular. On this occasion, most ot
those in the room being Americans, some of them
began to sing it, after they had bten drinking to-
gether for some time. Those who were in favor
of the bishop, got angry at this, and they proceed-
ed to blows. The Superior of the Seminary, who
was one of the party, struck old Father Bonin,
when two others came up to take his part. The
table was covered with cut glass tumbler:;, &c. sent
.in by the Superior of the Seminary, and in '1. short

time tw!J of the party were dancing on it, and
kicking it about in all directions. The floor thu8
oecame strewed with broken glass; and in a violent
scuffle which ensued between them all, several
feJl, and were badly cut.
In the midst of it came in Bishop Lartigue, who
attempted to stop the fight, but could not succeed
for some time, and' got one oi two severe blows
himself, from nobody knew who. The noise and
confusion were dreadful. The nuns present were
all frightened, but could do nothing, and the Supe·
rior of the Convent stood by wringing her hands,
and crying bitterly. When the battle was over,
one of the nuns wa~. sent to Father Bonin, to dress
a wound he had receh·ed, but was too much a£:·ita·
ted to do it, and I took her place. The old man
llad a long and deep cut near the temple, and bled
very freely. He said he had fallen upon a piece
of glass and cut it, but told me he had long wanted
to give the bishop one good knock, and had taken
advantage of the confusion to strike him in the
face.
I found afterwards that his story was very likely
o be true ; for the bishop had a good large bruise
near his eye, which he did not like to have seen,
and in consequence spent the remainder of the dny
in the nunnery. After sunset his calache was smt
for, in which he took his departure for home.
Some of the most alarming scenes I ever knew,
were the fights which now and then took place in
the nuns' dortoir at night, between priests. One

heard an alarm, anP. ascertained that such a quar-

(old Saint Mary,) had had a limb broken in at-

ing, when she interfered, and received a blow from
one of them. which laid her up for a long time,
and from which, as·she used to say, she never en-

REMARKS ON MY OWN FEELINGS. 129
CHAPTER XII.
Remarks on my own state and feelings, during the last few monthi-
Rea!llm~ why I did not publish all I krew in my first book-Reuoaa
(l)r malting new disclosures in this volume.
SINCE the completion and publication of my first
ediiion, I have experienced so much kindness and
'!ympathy among persons of different classes, who
have taken an interest in me, that I feel less like
a lonely and friendless female, and suffer no less
from the apprehensions of falling into the hands
of those enemies whose power I was then inclined
too much to magnify and to dread. I have real-
ized, from experience, what one of my earliest
female friends in New-York tried to make me· be-
lieve while I was an ~nmate of the Bellevue Asy-
lum, that no Roman priP'5t could exercise over me,
in this country, any of that authority to w.hich I had
been subject in Canada, and which I was informe~
was claimed by Conroy and Kelly.
It is but seldom that I am visited, in my dreams,
with those awful recollections which so frequent·
ly haunted me when I closed my volume which
has already been before the public. I was then
often rendered miserable by visions which would
for a time seem as vh1d and real as truth; and those
who were near me at night would tell me that I
screamedand spoke French. Butnow I have beenfor
weeks an inmate of a kind and sympathizing Chris·
tian family, and enjoyed the attentions, the counsels.

and the care of friends ,,;ith whom God has blessed
me; and now, with improved health, a constitutton
shattered, but apparently improving, and feelings
more uniforma.,~d tranquil, I have reviewed my sor-.
rowful life with more care and deliberation, and not
only brought together the contents of ~he preceding
pages, but recalled a considerable amount besides,
which I h~ve thought ought now to be recorded
and. published.
l am nowt perhaps, better able than before to
judge what kir.d of information is most impol,'tant
tp be laid before the people of this country ; for,
having cqpversed with many of different stations in
life, I have found not only that they are desirous of
learning the truth, but what kinds of truth it is they
ar~ most ignorant of.
'Vhile preparing for my first book, the question
qften presented itself to my mind, what class of facts
wit_
hi.n my knowledge, ought I to publish, and what,
if 1.\.ny, it would be proper to withhold~ Before I
could form any satisfactory plan on this subject, i..
~eelT,led necessary to fix upon some general princi ·

reluctance I naturally felt to present myself volon·
tnrily as a participator in dreadful and shocking
scenes, I Still might question, \vhether by nai'ra~
ting them, even with the most scrupulous caution,
I might not propagate something of the very evil
of which I had to com11lain. But I was among a
people. who had no suspicion of the existence of
enormities with which I had been familiar; and
there was nobody but myself able to open their
eyes. It ~·3emed to me to be important to the peo·
ple ·of the United States, that they should know
the characters ·of the priests and nuns of Montreal,
as I had seen undeniable evidence of their being
connected with othe·rs in this country, and ha~ing
C.~onsiderable influence with them. If allowed to
go <>n, who could tell .h'o\v far they might succeed
in bringing things to such il c'ohdition as they are
in Canada~ I therefore determined to run th; risk
of putting the modest to t'he blush, by the disclo-
sure of truths necessary to be known for the 'safety of
a state of ~ocie'ty which I had already seen enough
of to 'admire and love. In making such disclosures,
ho,vever, I determined to use 'tl'le most guarded Ian·
·guage, and as mur.h brevity as could be made con-
sistent with a dear cxpos1ire of what seemed mo$t
necessary to be known.
In the second place, there \vas a considerabl'e
amount of information of \vhich I was in posses-
sion, which I had received from others, nnd "Could

atate fncts of which I had been a. witness or a.par·

at least the great body of it, that I might run no
risk of introducing any thing erroneous into my
oook, whose accuracy I designed to render proof
against any attack whatever. Facts of this class
I have therefore thus far abstained from introducing.
, In the third place, there was one more class of
1tatements which I had it in my power to m·ake,
·IOncerning which I felt greatly at a loss. These

however, when I feel it my duty to proceed to oth·

I !\lAY perhaps have excited the curiosity of some
of the readers of my first volume by my allusion
to my three vows, and yet withholding them. t
could not make up my mind at that time to mention
them; and now, after much consideration, I have
)lai'dly kno,vn whether I ought to give them to the
American public, or to pass them over in silence.
I ~ave ascertained, however, since I have conve'rs·
ed with so many persons of different 'characters and
stations in this city, that very little knowledge ex-
ists in relation to Convents, and the character of
our Canadian priests and nuns, which, it seems to
me, ought to be better understood. Besides, I have
undertaken in this volume to disclose things not
mentioned in my former one, which are intimately
connected with the purport of those vows, nnd in·
deed quite dependent upon them.
In doing this, which I have deliberately conclu-
ded to be a part of l he solemn duty I owe \~the
world, it must be recollected by those who might
be most disposed to blame me, that the fault is
chargeab:e, not upon her who proclaims the evil,
but upon those who commit and conceal it.
The import of the First Vmo was this :-that all
officers and citizens admitted into the nunnery in
priests' dresses were to be obeyed in all things.

The Second Vow was--that there are things in
the Island, which, if I know, I will not disclose.
'fhese two vows, and a third one, led to the com .
mission of many crimes.
Some time after I was received, to my great
amazement, after we had retired to our sleeping
room one night, a man in the dress of a priest spoke
to me, whom I recognised to be a gentleman, who
resided but a fr.:w streets. from my mother's.-1
spoke to him, and asked him if it was not he ; 1
told him it was of no usc to attempt to deceive me,
for I knew him. He requested me never to men-
tion that I had seen him there ; and informed me
that he had given five hundred dollars to the Semi·
nary for permission to come in under the garb of a
priest, through the subterranean passage. He in-
formed me that many British officers were admit·
ted in the same manner.
Not many weeks after my reception, an old priest,
Bresseau, came into the nunnery one day; aud not
long: anerwards, in the priests' sitting-room I found
him in a state of intoxication. He began by say·
ing how little he cared for the bishop, and then
spoke on a subject which seemed to be uppermost
with him-a controversy which existed between the
bishop and himself. Without any encouragement
on my part, beyond that of being a listen~r. which
I could not very well avoid, he told me a long sto-
ry, the substance of which I very well remember,
although I do not know that I had re•:urred to it in
many m')nths,·until it was accidentally brought to
136 BLACK NUNNERY.
my mind by n little circumstance which occurre-
just before the following record of it was commi~
ted to paper.
PI iest Brcsscau, as he stated, had been for many
·ears stationed at the parish of Barqui-the position
·or distance of which I do not know. It was, I be·
lieve, out of the districtcd country, and I presume,
is not to be found on the Montreal calendar. How
long he had his residence there I did not under-
stand ; but long enough, as he said, to have a fami-
ly of seven children in the house of a woman of
the parish, and one of four in another. Besides,
he mentioned a third caie of a somewhat similar
nature.
J Bishop Lartiguc, os my informant declared, had
'ractisedon this plan in many instances-viz: when
·he saw that any country-priest was making money
fast, he would soon send another to take his place,
and remove him to some less lucrative situation.-
In the circumstances above mentioned, Bresseau re·
~eived an order from the bishop to leave his parish.
·He wished to remain, however, long enough to
make provision for the support of his children, and
determined that he would remain at all hazards.-
" He cared not for the pope or bishop," as he told
me; and reoolvcd to do as he pleased. He there.
fore resolved to take the only means that he kne\1
-
of, to obtain legal authority for remaining in hiJ
parish. The Governor of the province, as he sta
ted, had a right, at iea.st in certain cases, to prevent
the bishop from removing a. priest ; and he peti·

tioned. him to interfere in his behal£ In this he
was successful ; and he was suffered to retain his
place. 1,he bishop, of course, could not hut be ·
displeased at such an interference; and the circum- ·
stances of the case Bresseo.u either knew, or pre·
1umed to be extensively known among the clergy.
In time he succeeded in the object he had so
much at heart; for he o.ccumulo.ted money, and
by some means got enough to purchase three or
four farms, which, or the incomes of which, he
secured for the support of his children. He then
determined to hold out in his opposition to the bish-
op no longer, feeling rather conscience-smitten nt
the thought that he had set his authority at defian'Ce.
He did not wish to remain in the position of a
determined opponent of him, and decided to pro-.
ceed to Montreal, and have the matter properly ar-
ranged, so that he might again enter into a good
understanding and connexion with the Seminary.·
He added that he had recently arrived in the city,
and was expecting the bishop's return, who was then
absent on one of his tours of visitation, and expected
to return before many days. It appeared that he
had found no impediment to his entrance into the
Seminary, and he certainly was received with free~
dom in the nunnery, as he had been indulging in a
too free use of wine when I saw him.
1 heard some of the main points of Bresseau's
story corroborntvd by remarks which fell from_
sev-
eral other priests in conversation, particularly Bo-
nin, WiJO spoke of the conduct of Bresseau in hii

opposition to the bishop, with much applause. He
said that if he should ever hereafier be well sta·
tioned in any country place, he never would submit
to be driven out of it. He would be as bold and
reso!ute, and have his own way.
It was no uncommon thing to hear t>riests spcal<
Jn strong terms agajnst Bishop Lartigne, when
lhey supposed they might do so without its reach·
1ng his ears. I have heard some of them c.urse 1'
him, and use different French terms of contempt.
At the same time there were alwavs numbers of d
ihe priests who would on every occa"sion advocate n
his part. t1
Some time after the occurrences above mention· b-
ed, I was in the sick-room one day, attending on r~
the sick nuns, when several priests came in great · hi
haste, and asked me where Dufresne was, (he was at
then Confessor in the nunnery.) I replied that he ca
was probably in the chapel ; when they desired en
me to send Sainte Susan for him immediately. We fe1
went into the little sitting-room adjoining, which I W•
have so often mentioned before, and waited a short
time for Father Dufresne. While there, the priests St
spoke of there being a dreadful state of things in m1
the Seminary : a scene of violence and bloodshed,· T !
1\·hieh had induced them to come through the sub· lie
terranean passage to obtain assistance. Bresseau, m1
.hey said, was severely inJured; they left him ly·
ing bleeding and helpless, and they presumed he he
would die. ho

whom she could not find ; and then the priests sent
me to call the Superior, as they wanted permission
to bring Brcsseau into the hospital of the nunnery.
Some said he could be brought through the under·
ground passage, to avoid observation. Others s~lid
no; he could not be, but had better be brought in
a caleche into the nunnery yard- but the gates
must be instantly closed, to shut out the spectators.
I hastened off to find the Superior, and, having-
delivered my message to her, she returned with
me to the sitting-room. The priests told her that
there was a terrible affray in the Seminary, caused
by Bresseau's appearance. The bishop, who . had
recently returned, had found him there, and order~d
him out. Bresseau refused to obey, and the bishop
attempted to force him out, when one and another
carne to the aid of each, and a scuffle and a fight
ensued, with chairs for weapons, in which the of-
fender hnd been severely, and probably mortally
wounded.
" That is exactly as it should be," replied the
Superior, on hearing the news: "that is what thoso
must always expect who disobey their superiors.
That is the proper reward for those who arc rebel-
lious. It is his own fault, and the right punish-
ment has befallen him-let him die." .
The priests told her that they wished to obtain
her permission to bring the wounded man into the
hospital. " That," said she, "would be setting a ·
bad example, and encouraging disobedience in
others. Th~ devil will have him-let him die.11
.-

140 DLACK NUN N ERY.
At length, however, she appeared to relent, and
said sh~ would admit him out of charity, and for·
the love of God; though not for his own sake.
Oue of ttle priests, therefore, hurried off under
ground, to have Bresseau brought from the Semi-
nary. I think it was Bonin who carried t.he·
message.
It was not long before I saw a caleche corning
through the yard.; and when I was near eriough
tJ observe distinctly, I saw Bresseau in it, with his
l head leaning on the left, and a long wound on
his right temple, from which the blood was flow-
ing .freely. Several priests were round him, en-
deavoring to stanch the blood with a towel, and a
substance, which I believe grows in Canada, call- ·
ed vest'l'ilieu,. '!'heir efforts, however, appeared to
be in vain: for the blood continued to flow freshly
in spite of their exertions.
Bresseau, I found, was not so far gone as to have
lost his senses, or the power of speech : for I soon
heard him cu.rsing in a great passion. " That
rajjea} of a bishop," said he, " has done it for me,
with the kick he gave me in the stomach with his
boot."
When the carriage stopped, he was taken up by
three or four priests, and carried into the priestst
sitting-room, or parlor, and laid on a bed.
It happened that while the calcche had been on
the way from the Seminary, and in passing along•
the street, the wounded priest had attracted the·
notice of several passengers; so that a number of·

persons were immediately at the nunnery door, to
Jearn what was the matter. The answer made to
them, as I understood, was, that the old man had
fallen down stairs in the Seminary, and was on his
way to the hospital to be taken care of.
· 'rhe care of Bresse~m was assigned to me; and
I was employed much of my time in attendance on
him. Of all the profane and infamous men I ever
knew, I thought I never had met with his equal.
Yet, what made it the more remarkable, I under-
~ood he had several sisters who were very re:spect·
able ladies. He was always in bad humor, and
gave vent to it in volleys of curses, and language
otherwise most offensive.
I had reason to believe that he was attended
more than once by the nunnery physician, Dr.
Nelson : for I was several times told by. the old
nnns, that the doctor had given such and such
1lirections about him. Among t.he instructions
given me, as by his authority, was one to let Bres·
seau have no more brandy. When he learnt th'at
this was to be denied him, he cursed the doctor,
and then once more abused the bishop ; saying,
that after death, if he found he had the power,
there was not a devil in hell that he would not
send to torment him. He one day handed me a
tumbler to get some brandy for him ; and on my
refusing, he threw it at my head. I was so much
frightened, that I screamed and ran away.
. Bresseau lingered in the nunnery, I think, about
thr-ee wetk:3. Several priests came in, at different
142 BLACK N UN XEll~·.
times, to ask his pardon in any thing they might
have offended him. He freely granted their re·
quests, bu~ always with. the condition, that they
should, on every occasion. that, might offer, give
the bishop a blow for him. He often indulged in
the most severe language against the bishop, but
w.as usuaJly more guarded in the presence of the.
old nuns, who sometimes checked him when he
went too far, by threatening to tell the Superior.
He knew that she had the power of turning him
out of the nunnery when she pleased, and that i(
he were turned out, he would have no better ac·
~ommodations than those afforded by the Seminary.
J.'here he might stay in his room, and receive th~1
attentions of a man, but the treatment of the sick
i~ ':astly inferior in that institution, to what IS se.,
<;UI:ed.t:o thf;II). in the Hotel Dieu.
Tl,le Superior one day called me to her room,.
saying she wished me to fix a cap for her to gQ
out wit}). I went to the. drawer to get one out.
when I heard tbe bishop's name mentioned as en
t.ering, and was, therefor~. induced to pay attention
~o the conversatiOn, which ensued between him
~nd th~ Superior, when otherwise, it was possibl~,
I might not. H e told her she had taken an im-
proper step, in admitting Bresseau into the nunnery.
She had done that which she had no busine~s to
do. The consequences would be bad-for if he
had remained in ·the Seminary, he would have
humbled himself, and submitted to hi:; authority,
but now he was encouraged to set him at defiance.

It would be worse for his soul, as he would suffer

The Superior listened to the reproof of the bishop
with seeming respr.!t, and did not attempt to justify
herself entireIy. " \Ve nre all ap! to err,11

said; " I as well as others. I thought I was doing

awful manner. A few moments after, having left
the room; I was informed that be had breathed

CHAPTER XIV.
~uos' Island What I heard of it in my Childhood-The dift"erent
Islands so called-Priest L'Esperance-My visit to Nuns' l::land.
JANE RAY, in a conversation she once had with
me, told me that she had been at Nuns' Island, and
mentioned strange things in relation to it, which
made a considerable impression on my mind: Of
the place to which she referred, I had before a lit-
1
tle knowledge, as much, I suppose, as is possessed
by most people in Montreal, and the vicinity. I
knew that there were several islands in the St.
Lawrence called Nuns' Islands, of which the'three
principal ones have large buildings upon them.
Some of these must have been noticed by almost
every person visiting Montreal, particularly the
one nearest that city, which belongs to the Gray
Nuns, and is in full view from Laprairie, and the
ferry. Many travellers from the United States
must also have noticed the Black Nuns' Island
near Lachine, several miles up the river. I had
often seen it when visiting my uncle, who lives
near that town ; and had heard reports and suspi·
cions concerning it.
A considerable part of it is shut in by a high
stone wall, which encloses three large buildings of
the same material ; but I never had been with any
person who gave me any description of it from
personal knowledge, as all access to it was said to

uncle sometimes sold cattle to persons employed tel
purchase for the island, but never visited the place
Some of the neighbors, parti~ularly old country
people, I have heard call the place 11
The Priests~
Wives' Island." I sometimes used to look towards
it with some curiosity; but even from my uncle's
garret vv·indow, little of the buildings v:as discern·
ible except the chimneys, according to my rec.ollec-
tion, the view of them being intercl•pted, I think,
by some high land on the great island; the other
.Nuns' Islands, as I might have mentioned before,
being called 11
Les petits isles ''-the s-mall ·islq,nds.
Thus it was that I knew little about the subject on
which Jane Ray spoke, on the occasion above a.-
luded to ; but what she said, although spoken with
reserve, ancl an air of mystery, impressed me with
the. conviction that the island was the scene of
strange things.
I must also stop here a moment to remark, that this
was not the first intimation I had in relation to that
place, though what I had before received was ve·ry
indistinct. It was conveyed to me in one of the-.
three oaths, which I was required to take immed~o..
ately on. my taking the Black Veil, as the read€\
wili find in my first volume.• Those oaths I fc\
much unwillingness to communicate in that booM;
because they bound us to perform things of a r&
volting· nature, and because they are connecte!

'"·ith disclosures which I thought best to reserve
for the time. In one of those oaths I had made a
most solemn promise to do every thing, that might
be required of mo at Nuns' Island, and never to
speak in the nunnery Gf things which I might
witness there. This w:1..:; accompanied with the
most dreadful imprecations on myself, in case I
should violate the oath : as that I might be sunk
to the lowest place in hell, have the worst of devils
"for my tormentors, and never see the face of the
! Savior. No information was given me, however,
from which I might form any idea of the condition
of Nuns' Island, or the scenes transacted there. I
could only form an unfavorable idea ·of the place.
I may stop here a moment, to speak of the
Priests' Farm. The Priests' Farm is a piece of
ground not far from Montreal, of which I ·repeat-
edly heard mention made while I was in the nun-
nery. Father Phelan told me most of what I then
heard said about it. No person, as I understood,
is ever admitted there without permission from the
Seminary. Priests, under penaQce for offences
committed in their pari$hes, arc sometimes sent
there for a time. I have reason to believe that
some old nuns are constantly kept there, and that
otht~rs are f~equently taken to and from there and
the nunnery, but always in priests' dresses.
Father Phelan told me, that if a priest wishes
'to get a. handsome woman in his pov<:er, he some-
'times manages to get her to the Farm, and then
her friends never hear from·her again: He told

.me also that the priests are sometimes punished
there, who have offended their superiors, by means
of a cap, which is drawn over their head and face,
and destroys life almost at once. From what he
said, I should judge that the <'.ap might be in so~e
respects like th,i.~ I have worn in the Nunnery,
'and that it was frequently used. If these in au-
thority are disobeyed in any manner, he said, the
offender is sure to be punished at the P riests' Farm.
There was a young priest, named VEsperance,
very ignorant and disagreeable, whom I saw a few
months after I took the veil. I had confessed to
him when in the Congregational Nunnery. He
came to the Black Nunnery several times, an4 I
had several conversations with him on different sub-
jects, particularly one Sunday, when he wished
me to stand by and see that he ~as not cheated at
cards. But one day he made a proposition tom~,
which I thought I 011ght to communicate to the
Superior. He informed me that he was going to
the United States a~ a missionary, and invited me
to go with him, as a teacher, and priv~tely live
as his wife. He said that the Bishop would
doubtless permit me to leave the Convent in secret,
and we should never be known. ! .made little re-
ply to this proposal ; but took an early opportunity,
when I found the Superior in her romp alone, to
acquaint her with it. It was one day while I was
fixing a dress for her. She expressed great dis·
,pleasure, and evidently appeared to regard the
subject very seriously.
•
148 BLACK NUNNERY.
I soon after found thi:lt she had informed Fathe!
Phelan, for he spoke of the proposal, and said,
·" Je lui d0nnerais un coup qu'il ne faut pas un
Becond." [l will give him a dose, (that is, either
blow or a drink,) that shall be the last.] From
·this time the Superior and others began to talk to
me of paying a visit to Nuns' Island. She some-
times said it would be good for my health, as I
needed air and exercise ; but I found that both she
·and Father Phelan had a particular wish that I
should go; and I was disposed to obey them, as I
1
considered it my duty. I found that the Superior
appeared, to L'Esperance, to give in and be his
frien<l. Something I now understand, which I
·could not as well penetrate at that time. I have
no doubt of the meaning of the expression of Fa-
ther Phelan, which I have given above, although
·its meaning is of itself rather equivocal.
At length the time was fixed for my visit to the
Island, and I was to go in company with L'Espe-
rance, at a late hour of the night, and in disguise,
to avoid d~s~overy. At the time appointed, I was
taken into the Superior's room, had a black cloak
thrown over me, (such as are worn by the "Sisters
of Charity," in the streets of New York,) and the
hood pulled over my head. This was taken from
a cupboard near the Superior's room, where a sup-
ply is always kept. We then left the Convent
by the same door through which I afterwards es-
caped, turned to the left round the end of the Veil-
ed Department, and at the gate opening on St. Jo-

aeph's street, found a coach (charrette) into which
we got.
We took our seats in the carriage, and the
coachman drove to the Seminary, where he stop-
ped, and my companion alighted, rang a bell, and
was admitted by the yardman, who then tame out
and addressed a few words to me, and remarked
that it was a raw night, and rather late to cross.
I am unable to speak with certainty of the season,
but I think it mus~ have been early in autumn.
After a delay of fifteen or twenty minutes, L'Espe·
ranee reappeared, with another priest, who took
his seat without being introduced, or na\:ted to me.
I did not remember ever to have seen him, and {lid
not afterwards learn his name or any thing con·
eerning him.
The city streets were still as we passed through
them, and nothing occurred worthy of notice, until
we reached the bank of the St. Lawrenc.e, at a soli•
tary spot, some distance below the outskirts of La·
chine. There we went down the bank to the
river's side, where we found a boat with two men,
who were addressed by my companions familiarly.
as Pierre and Jacques. They received us at .once,
;'!.S if they had expected our ·arrival; and, indeecJ,
complained that they had been o~liged to outsW.y
the appointed time by an hour or two.
These men I recognised, having repeatedly see~
them at the nunnery, on errands to the Superiq1~

time. They brought the green trees, or branches,
every year, wh~~h were put up before the Nun-
nery, at the time of the Procession, which is held in
..:~mmemoration of the Savior's entra.nr.e if:!to Jeru-
salem, when a priest walks under a canopy held
over.his hend, while lighted candles are carried,
flowers arc strown before him, and all the Congre-
gational Nuns o.re out.
The boatmen were evidently much besotted with
liquor ; and I had afterwards reason to believe that
they were kept in this condition, most if not all
1their time. . We were, however, at length safely
landed, and I found we were on Nuns' Island.
We proceeded up from the sho~e, passed under
th~;~ shade of trees, over turf still green, if I recol-
lect right, and soon reached a gate in a high wall:
where one of the priests rang a bell. An old man
opened it and freely admitted u~. as if prepared for
our arrival. Indeed, it was evident that he had ex·
pected the arrival of visiters, for he told us we
should find a light in the building. The priests
seemed well acquainted with the place, and led
me across a yard, towards three larf)'~ edifices, two
of which stood at right angles. 'Ve entered the
'ne on' the right, by a door which opened into a
narrow passage, on the left of whic~ an inner door
led us into a room with plain furniture, in which·

surprise, but rcccived me with cordiality, and ap~
pcared to have been sitting up till that late hour,
on purpose to await us. H ere I took a scat nnd
sat for some time. The oltl nuns brought me some.
refreshments, of which I partook; and then one.
of them led me to a chamber near the end of ·the
building, in which were two or three very wide
beds, at least one of which was occupied by
women. Into one of the others I soon got, at th~
proposition of my attendant, and she threw herself
down upon one of the others, near me, and enter-
ed into some conversation, with m-..:ch appearance
of kindness, in which she mentioned that infoTma-
tion had been sent from the nunnery, that our
party would arrive at the is)and that night, and that
the gardener, as weli as themselves, had been duJv
notified of it.
In the morning I found that I was at liberty to
go where I pleased, withou! leaving the wallF., as
no ceremonies were to be performed, or prayers
sa~d, as in the nunnery. I was under no obliga-
tion tc1 ·rise at any particular time, there was no
fixed hour for breakfast, no processions were to be
formed, no time of silence to be observed, and,
which was still better, no penances were to be ap-
prehended. I took advantage of the freedom al-
lowed me, to make some observations on things
around me. The following description embraces
things which I subsequently observed, and is in-
troduced here to make it more complete. An

several haBty drawings made with my own hand,
amonded in some points according to descriptions I
1nbsequemly gave. I do not pretend to perfect
accuracy in all things, for that cannot be reason·
ably expected in a case of this kind. As in my
plan of the Veiled Department of the Nunnery,
so here, I insist that the relative position of build·
ings and apartments, doors, windows, stair·cascs,
the furniture, and uses of different parts, as far as
I give them, are substantidly correct; and in
relation to this place, as well as to the Convent,
t I solemnly declare, the truth of my narrative will
be established whenever a fair examination of the
place shall be made. To that test I appeal, and
on that evidence I rely. What I have to say of
Nuns' Island may be by many questioned, or per-
haps wholly discredited. To such persons I will
iay-I have furnished you with all the evidence
in my power, and would gladly give more if it
were at my command. I take it upon myself, spon-
taneously, and wi~
1
\out any other motives than n
desire to publish the truth, the declaration of things,
which must expose me to the enmity of many per-
sons. If this volume is proved false, my former
one will of course lose all credit, and my charac-
ter must be past recovery. I shall be condemned
as a false-hearted, though probably a pretty inge-
nious fabricator, and must lose the confidence and
eountenance, the society and kindness of such
friends as I now possess. These considerationS
would lead to the presumption that what I am tO

say is not n deliberate forgery; but my renders may
ask for more decisi\'e e\'idence.
'l'o them I would say, that in the river St. Law·
renee lies Nuns' Island, and on that island are the
edifices I describe, surrounded by their wall, nnd
carefully sccludccl from the approach of all but the
vriests, nuns, and their confcdl'l'atcs and victims.
Within that wall are many \'isiblc and tangible
witnesses, ready to bear testimony to my truth.
If access can be obtained, and the premises exami·
ned, you will be con\'inccd, and 1shall be justified.
Maria Monk tells a tale which · it is important to
people of America to know; but she may perhaps
excite only·the unbelief, the cont.cmpt, or coridcrn-
nntion of some by her attempt to open their eyes:
but whenever Nuns' Island shall be examined, her
veracity will be established beyond the reach of
suspicion, and then, I rejoice to think, her motives
will, and must be appreciated. This confirmation
she may, perhaps, not lile to witness; but she has
the satisfaction of anticipating it as a thing abso·
lutely certain, as well as the hope to indulge, that
her child will at some future day reap some benefit
from it, in the regard of those among whom she
may dwell.

NuNs' IsLAND, (that is, the Black Nuns' b!and,)
lies in the St. Lawrence, not far, I think, from the
middle of it, a little below Lachine. The wall
l encloses a ::or.siderable space, but yet leaves an
extensive pasture outside, with fruit trees scattered
about it, and room for two or three small buildings.
It is so high as to shut out the view of the edifices
from any near point, except, perhaps, the roof and
some small part of the upper stories. It has but
or.e gate, which is generally closed, and sufficiently
watched by three or four yardmen, to keep out all
persons not allowed to enter, viz. such as bring no
permits from the Bishop, or the Superior of the
Seminary and Hotel Dieu Nunnery. rrhe yard-
men, as at the nunnery, are never allowed to enter
the buildings, unless it be such parts as are devuted
to the stable, fuel, &c.
The buildings are three in number. The lar-
gest stands in front, the second behind it, and the
third at right angles, on the right, as you enter
the first; and the last is that which I first entered.
F.ntering the first building by the front door, you

first story rooms along the front are sleeping·
rooms, and two of those in the rear are spacious
and elegant sitting-rooms, with windows that open
upon a gallery, which extends along the rear, and
one end of the building on the left hand. 'Vith it
a uoor communicates from one of them, and this
is the only way of access to it from this side of the
building, which looks towards Montreal. In the
gallery we sometimes walked for exercise.
The first large room had eleg:mt blue merino
curtains with tassels. There was an ottoman in it,
of blue cloth, bound with black velvet, with raised
corners, so formed us to afford a distinct seat Qn
each side, 'being the most elegant thing of the kind
I ever saw. In one corner of the room was n
sofa. The walls are pink, and the cornice is of
rich alabaster work, a piece of which I picked up
one day on the floor.
Adjoining this apartment is tbe dining-room,
which, like it, is carpeted. The walls are colored
blue, and the windows without curtains. Except
during meal times, a table commonly stood in this
room, with papers on it. From this room is a door
opening, (iike the windows,) upon the piazza,
which is the only direct access to it fj:om any of
the rooms.
Beyond th·~ dining-room is a large spare-room·,
ar1d another of some kinJ beyond that.
'rhe Maircase to the second story leads on from
that below, as well as up to the garnt. Near it
is a large stove for warming the ~:econd story in

the winter; nnd doors open on several sides. One
of them leads into a place '"hich I thought very
singular, and the use of which I c.ould not imagine.
ll is a large room without furniture, with a stone
floor, lighted, I believe, only by a small grated
window, with about four panes of glass. In the
midst of this room is a small one, capable of
containing about twenty persons, entirely unfur·
nished, and perfectly dark. The partitions are
so thin, that I think a conversation might bo
! overheard through them, even if conducted in a low
VOICe.
At one end of this story are four bed-rooms, each
with two windows, a bed, and other plain furniture.
These rooms are warmed by one stove, placed in
the middle partition, pipes from which extend both
ways through the other partitions.
The entrance to the basement is at one end.
The second room in it is the kitchen, with a large
Daking furnace and roasting jack, ancl several
t1mall furnaces, in a corner. A large table used to
stand in the middle, and the steps lead up outside to
the gallery, which is supported by timbers. The
next room has a stone floor, and the remaining one
on that side of the basement, a wooden floor; On
the front side, and adjoining, is a small cellar with
only a little light admitted through a narrow win-
dow, which I have peeped through from without.
The remajnder of the front cellar is all in one
room, and used for storing fuel.

The second and smallest building, which is in
the rear of this, I was in but three times. It has
iwo stories, with a n1!mber of small rooms, and lit·
tle furniture. It appeared to be principally devoted
to the priests, when I was there, as I recollect see-
ing a number of priests there, and several music::tl
instruments 1ying about.
The thi~·d building has a staircase leading up
from the visiters' room, which I first entered, into
the second story, which is oc~.:upied by sleeping-
rooms, with a passuge on one side i~to which they
open.
I have been in the garret of the third buildipg.
It is not partitioned off into rooms, but all thrown
into one, if I except a small part towards one end,
where pigeons are caught. There is a large looking·
glass, so placed that the birds may see themselves
in it as they fly by; and, some wheat being sca,lter-
cd near, considerable numbers are caught, most of
which are killed, and sen to market in MontreaL
The pigeons, }leing deceived, and taking their own
shadows for other birds, arc induced to stop, and
are then attracted in by the food, until they cannot
escape. This is a very common way of taking
i;hem in Canada. While in the garret, I some-
times looked out of the windows, at.d enjoyed a
fine view. I could see the river St. Lawrence for
a considerable distance, with boats of Canadians or
Indians passing down, or crossing to the village of
Caughnawaga, which was also in sight, as well as
the river's banks for .~;omu miles. According to
~9
I
(
158 BLACK NUNNERY.
my recollection, there are windows only at cne end,
and on one side of the garret.
They have a ciergerie, or candle·room in one of
the buildings, where, however, only tallow candles
are manufactured; there is sometimes a good deal
of work to be performed. in that branch of busi-
ness.
On1 i.ty Father Phelan met me in the Pink
Room, and informed me that he had something for
me to do. I of course did not dare to object, much
l less to disobey, after the solemn obligations of my
oath, and the hazard, or rather certainty of punish-
ment. I felt myself to be no less in the power of
others there, than when I was in the nunnery, and
believed that disobedience would be as surely fol-
lowed with a heavy penalty. Besides, I believed
that all authority was vested in the Priests, by the
divine law j and was disposed, on this account, (at
least a great portion of the time,) blindly to follow
their commands and indications, without presuming
to question the propriety of them.
Father Phelan told me that I should meet with
L'Esperance in the other building, that is, the se·
~ond, in an apartment whicfi he mentioned; and
he wishtJd me to take him to a chamber, which he
described, and give him a glass of wine. I should
find two bottles, he informed me, in the cupboard
in that room, one of them marked with a paper,
and that I should pour out for him a tumbler full
from that, and might drink some from the other

Jlddicted to drink, and always ready for wine. I
might, under other circumstances, have questioned
the object of the step required, or inquired wha.'l.
was the reason for proceeding in such a manner ;
whether there was any thing mixed with the wine
in either bottle, and if so, what, and in which.
But how could I dare to do so in my present situa-
tion 1 I can hardly think that any consideration
would have induced me. I therefore proceeded to
the place indicated, and met L'Esperance, invited
him to take some wine, aad led him to the apart-
ment. On opening the cupboard, I found two bot-
tles, as I had been told I should, one with a paper
upon it; and filling a tumbler from it with red
wine, and another from the other, I presented the
former tCl L'Esperance, and taking the ot~:er, began
to drink. Suddenly it occurred to me, with an im-
pression of horror, which I cannot describe, that if
there was poison in the wine I had given to the
priest, I should be the cause of his death. Phelan
had threatened, in the Convent, to give him a dose
that should be his last; and was not this the way in
which he intended to accomplish his purpose 1 My
feelings were entirely too strong to be restrained. I
became in an instant overpowered witli the conyic-
tion of the truth ; and I believe that no threat or
punishment in the power of those around me to in-
flict, would have induced me any longer to pursue
the plan on which I was proceeding.
I turned round to look at the priest, and saw
that he had not hesitated to take off the draught l
'160 DLACJ{ NUNNERY.
had·presented to him, and was then drinking the
dregs of the- cup. What I felt, it would be useless
for me to attempt to describe. I put down the
glass I held in my own hand, a considerable por-
tion from which I had swallowed, and hastened
out of the room without speaking, in a state of mind
distressing beyond endurance. I left the house,
ran across the yard to that from which I had pro-
ceeded, rushed into the room in which I had left
father Phelan, and threw myself upon the sofa. A
new thought had occurred to me on the way. Per•
haps my wine had been poisoned, either by de·
sign or accident : for how did I know that the pa·
per had not been put upon the wrong bottle, or
what reason had I to confide in the honour of any
person who would treat another as I supposed
L'Esperance had been treated1 In my extreme agi-
tation of mind, I did not stop to reason : but my
fears led me to believe the most dreadful thing
which suggested itself. I therefore at once em-
braced the idea that I was poisoned, and was soon
to die in agony. I began to cry, and ~oon to
scream with horror, regardless of every thing
around me. Some of the old nuns came to my as-
sistance, and first asked me to be quiet, and then
commanded me, lest others should learn the cause ;
but for a long time they found it impossible to paci-
fy me. From some remarks which fell from them,
I plainly understood that they had been watching
me while I was giving L'Esperance the wme,
probably through a glass door.

My health was seriously affected by the occur·

and there was confined about ten days, suffering
for a time great pain. My strength became gradu-
ally restored, but it was long before I could pru·
dently leave my room.

Young Women from the U. State11.
THERE were several beds in the same room,
occupied by young women, whose health was fee·
ble. 'Vhile I remained in the room, there were
several changes among the other occupants: for
~ometimes one would enter, and occasionally an-
other would leave us. The names of many I never
heard, and some of them seemed to be almost en-
tirely unknown to each other. These were com-
monly reserved and silent, apparently averse to
communicating any thing, and not well satisfied
with their condition or company. Some of those
who left the room while I was in it, I afterwards
met with in some of the apartments ; but others I
never saw again nor heard of.
What could be the object of having so many
young women assembled here-who they were,
and whence they had come, were natural ques-
tions : but at first I had no one to answer them.
The reserve and depression observable in such
ns I have mentioned, were not by any means exhi-
bited by all. Several of my room-mates, on the
contrary, were very willing to converse, and in-
deed quite communicative. From these I soon de.
rived information which explained what woull\

otherwise have appeared mysterious. I may, per-
haps, best convey to my readers the impressions
which I received, by giving it to them as I myself
received it.
. There was a young woman who occupied the
Ded directly opposite mine, who was called Ange·
lique. She was among the most communicative
of all, and one of the first who talked with me.
She felt no unwillingness to make known to me
her history, ancl conversed with apparent frankness
and sincerity. She was of middling stature, slen-
der, with dark eyes and hair. She informed me
that she had once been in the Congregational Nun·
nery, but arrived at the Island a few weeks before
from New York, where she had resided for somo
time; and that her visit to Canada was owing to
her intimacy \Vith a distinguished personage, at
whose house she used frequently to resort. She
stated that she used to go to his residence some..
times in the dress of a man, at evening ; and on
one occasion felt much apprehension of being dis-
covered. She happened to be late, and had to make
so much noise to gain admittance, that she attract~
~d the attention, not only of two men who appear-
ed to be at watch on a neighboring corner, but of
the neighbors, who raised their windows to see
what was the matter, when, seeing a head with a
Jlight-cap at the window, some one laughed in a
way calculated to express, and at the same time to
excite suspicion. She continued in this practice
until it was thought necessary, for the sake of con~

eealment, to send her to 1\ retired place for a time;
and she accordingly proceeded to Canada, and wu
received on Nuns' Island. She informed me fur·
ther, that she had then become a mother, had had
her child taken from her immediately, and had not
l!een it since; and expected to return to New
York when her health should be restored.
. She told me that most of the young women I
saw, were from the United States. They were the
victims of priests, who had access to them in the
!Chools and nunneries, to which they were attach·
eel. Some, I understood, were "Sisters of Charity,"
as they are called in this country, who had left
their missions for a time on similar emergencies j
but most of them were natives of the states, attach·
ed to the nunneries there, either as nuns, novices,
or scholars. These had come off under different
pretences ; the place of their retreat, as well as the
eause of their journey, being kept a profound se-
cret from their friends. I got the impression that
Angeliquc was one of the " Sisters of Charity"
herself, though I am not certain that she told
ine so.
She urged me to return to New York with her;
saying I should prefer it to Canada, and used such
arguments as she supposed would incline me to
accede to her proposition. As for herself, she said
she should suffer nothing on account of her expe•
dition to the island, as nobody could ever discover
that she had gone there for an:r thing but a com·
inon visit to Canada.

WOMEN FROM TilE UNITED.· STATES. 165
One of the young women, who conversed some•
what freely with me, was called Miss Gordon,
which I presumP. was her real name. She was
!mall, good-looking, with light hair, and had a scar
Dn her lip. She told me that she had been in a
Convent in some part of the United States, but not
J3 a nun- I suppose, as a scholar; and had come
to the Island for the same reason as many of the
others, having been sent ~ncre by the head priest.
She' was soon to return, and told me that she
was resolved to leave the Convent, and to return
to it no more. She carefully abstained from men·
tioning the place of her residence ; and this is
all I recollect about her, except ihat her infant,had
been takt>n from her, (a~ I was informed was the
common practice,) to be placed in the Orphan
Asylum, at the Gray Nunnery.
• Several of the young women told me they had
come from the United States, and mentioned their
places of residence ; but from my ignorance of the
country, I did not particularly regard them, nor
can I now remember them. One said she had been
there several times, and had sent several infants to
the Gray Nuns, and hoped to live to come adozen
times more. I judged her to be one of the "Sisters
of Charity," because she wore a hood like theirs: .
· ·One of these young women had a peculiar scar
on her cheek, and a mole on her lip, which I well
temember, and should know again anywhere. · I
nave wished, when meeting any of the " Sisters
~f Charity," in New York, to have their hood~

raised, as I might, perhaps, rer.ognise somo oC
them. Possibly I might find the peculiar scar, and·
the mole on one of their faces, or something else, I
have seen on Nuns1
Island-at least so I sometimes
think. I have been told by a young Catholic ·wo-
man, in New York,· that many of the "Sisters of
Charity" are Canadians, and that she knew one
who could hardly speak the English language. I
recollect to have seen several, at different times,
while in the school of the Congregational Nun-
nery, takmg leave, to go on missions to L'Ame-
rique, as they sometimes called the United States.
One of the women remarked, in conversation
one day, that the priests had more children born on
that Island in a year, than there commonly are in
a good-sized country village.
There were several arrivals of young women,
while I was on the island, and several left it, but I
never saw them coming or going, and was com•
monly left to infer it from circumstances which
carne under my notice. Some of the priests, I be-
lieve, were frequently going and coming : as there
is no obstacle in the way of those who have the
necessary authority.
A few days before my leaving the plact\ I miss-
ed Angelique from her bed, and on inquiry, was
inform'ea that she had left the island. She might
have been gone a day or two before I missed-her:
fur as we went to bed and rose when we pleased,
we were not regular in our hours, and did not ex•
pect to find each other r~gular.

RESTORATION TO REALTJI, 167
She wa~:~ not seen by me again, nor have I heard
of her since that day. I am still sometimes re-
minded of her, or some of the other visiters at
Nuns' Island, when I meet one of the "Sisters of
Charity" in the street.
After the restoration of my health, I began to
leave my room, and visit the different apartments
as before. I commonly spent most of the daytime
in the large building, (No. 1,) and often sat at the
window, at the end of the dark passage, enjoying
the air and the view, which was extensive a~d
agrefable.

h would be impossible for me to form any esti-
mate, on which I could place reliance, of the num-
ber of men or women I saw ou Nuns' Island. ·
There was no regular time fo:· breakfast, dinner·
! or supper. No bell was rung, no notice was given ·
l'or meals, any more than for retiring at night, or ·
rising in the morning. Food was always prepa-
red and ready, when any of us were disposed to eat;
and we went when we cnvse, a1one or in company,

Many of my readers may not be aware of the
ttyle of eating practised among many of the lower
Canadians. So many of the priests are of Cana-
dian origin, that their meals in the nunnery, and
on th. ..Aland, arP- often disposed of in a rude and
unmanner~ y way, with but little use of knives and.
forks. We often ate standing, while on the island,
nnd it was common to take even meat in the
fingers.
As there was no general call, or occasion for as-
sembling at any time, the inmates resorted to thei;
rooms, or lounged about the galleries, yard, or sit-

been impossible to count them all, eve!'l if I had
been disposed. But I did not ever think of do-
ing so.
Some of the priests, as I understood, were there
on penances. This was indeed a merf'ly nominal
thing. Priests who have been complained of by
their parishioners, in a formal manner, arc some-
times sent by the bishop to Nuns' Is!: td, and some-
times to the Priests' Farm, to f:atisfy their accusers
With the form of punishment. l had t·cnson, how-
ever, to believe thnt they generally suffered no pri-
vations, and were far from 1·cgarding their resi-
dence as a plac.e of punishment. On the contrary,
I often saw thmn partal'e of indulgences. ·'rho
edifice numbered 3, was specially devoted to the
priests : but they enjoyed much liberty, ar,d were
·allowed to go wherever they pleased.
Among their occupations, :some occasionally
spent a while in reading; and I saw a number of
books lying about in several rooms, which the wo-
men\vere not expected to look at. Some ·played
flutes and sang. I have SGmetimes heard several
of them play together. Most of their music, how-
ever, was vocal ; and while I was on the island I
heard a variety of songs sung, pnrticularJy those
which were most popular in the nunnery.
:'rhe women, that is those whose health would
permit, had a variety of work to periorm, ·particu-
larly with the "ecdle. Sometimes an order would
come from t"'~ Superior of the nunnery, to mako
a number of towels or sheets, and sometimes:si.t

or eight shirts were ordered for some priest, in
great haste. The old nuns would call upon us to
as~cmble, and gave us no peace till they were
done. Order!'! sometimes came for the Seminary,
Nunnery, Priests' Farm, and Bishop. It com-
monly happened, however, that the greater part of
the job was performed by a few of the most indus-
trious or good·natured ones; for the cross and in-
dolent would contrive to get off their part on who-
ever would do it. At certain seasons of the year
1
large quantities of soap were made, and then old
Aunts Margaret and Susan are sent from the nun-
nery to manage that depN~ment. Butter and
cheese are made from the milk of the cows kept
on the island ; and several of the nuns most expert.
in making them, are employed in the dairy.
I had often noticed a young woman, apparently •
rather older than myself, with a reculiarly un-
happy and depressed countenance ; but I had never
spoken with her. One day I was set to sew with
he~ on the same piece-a sheet which was to be
made. We sat together sewing a.whole afternoo.n,
during which little or nothing was said by either
of us. ~¥hen it grew too dark to do any more,
and our work was laid aside, we kept our places;
and she began to converse with a degree .of free.-
'dom which I had not expected. We were at the
end of.the long gallery in the building ·No. l, near
the window where I often sat, and knew that we
·could not be overheard. ..

,unhappy; and spoke of the wretchedness of such
a situation, to which I replied with equal freedom,
and in such a manner as to lead her on to say
·more. Indeed, she must have known, that if she
gave me opportunity to accuse her of complainin~,
and to get her subjected to severe penances or pun·
ishment, I equally committed myself.
She then went on to speak of her early life, and
the place of her former residence, which I do not
·recollect, although she named it. I have the im·
·pression that it was somewhere in Upper Canada,
a retired and pleasant spot. She said that she long-
.ed to get away from the nuns and priests, but knew
not how. She was a nun in some Conveqt, I do
not know where; and her Superior was very harsh
in her treatment, and had put some dreadful pen·
ilnces upon her. Once in particular, she had near·
ly destroyed her life; for she made her lie, for se-
veral weeks, upon a bed made of ropes, which
weakened and injured her so much, that she was
unable to sit up for six weeks. If we could con-
trive any way of escaping from the Island, we
might find our way to her native place, where she
·would be certain of getting a good and comfortable
residence, for me as well as herself. At the same
time she spoke of it as uttedy hopeless, shut up
and watched as we were. She spoke of the pen-
ances she had endured, with a kind of horror; and
said it was hard for her to believe that it was by
means of such sufferings that anybody coulJ get
to heaven. Indeed, she said heaven must be a
172 DLACK NUNNERY.
dreadful place, if such trials as she was subJect t~
were the way of introduction to it.
She did not speak particularly of the occasien
of her visit to the Island: but, from the state of
her health, and other circumstances, I had ·no
·doubt that it was similar to that which had brought
many others there.
I found that her melancholy was that of despair.
While speaking of her home, she seemed, indeed,
to forget,. for a moment, that it was impossible for
~er ever to see it again, and exclaimed, " 0, how
happy we sh<luld be, living there together I" But
then, when recurring again to her actual condi-
tion, she assured me that she constantly prayed for
death, and sometimes thought seriously that she
would take her own life.
-. I felt very much for her, and once told her I
would alinost venture to attempt an escape with
her. She said that would be entirely useless-we
had no chance at all. I afterwards trembled to
think how I had exposed myself, and that she
might possibly inform against me: but this she
never did. ..
I was not particular in noticing the number of
days I spent on Nuns' Island: but I believe I was
there very nearly three weeks. I am certain, at
kast, that three Sundays passed while I was there.
One evening an old nun told me I was to return
to the nunnery; and that night I set out in com·
pany· with three priests, and several nuns, after
putting on a black cloak and hood, as before.

Snvage was one of the priests, and Brunenu an·
other. The latter was then confessor at the nun·
nery. Sainte .Mary, I remember, was one of the
nuns in company, and two others were old nuns,
who expressed much regret at leaving the place,
saying, that if there was any thing to be done in
the nunnery more than common, they must al-
ways be sent for.
We proceeded from the gate of the wall on foot
to the shore, where Jacques and Pierre were ready
with their boat; and having entered it, they rowed
across to the river's shore, where we found a cha-
rette waiting for us, in which •ve rode to the city.
The driver stopped v.t the nunnery gate,. from
which I had started with L'Esperance, and having
alighted and rung, we were admitted into the nun-
nery through the chapel, the sacristy, and the long
passage I have more than once alluded to, in my
former work. Proceeding to the Superior's room,
she received me; and, having made me take off
my cloak and leave it there, she conducted me
into the nuns' sleeping-room, where I retired to
bed.
'fhe next morning, when Jane Ray met me, she
addressed me with a sarcastic look, saying-
" 'V< :i, so you've been to the White Cats' cas-
tle 7"
I never heard the name of L'Esperance men-
tioned after this, except on two occasions. Father
Pheian one day remarked, "So you gave him a
good dose!" thereby confirming my belief, that he

·tlake me feel certain of it. A considerable time
tfterwards, while I was in the sick-room, I was
called to attend a mass, to be celebrated in honor
.of L'Esperance ; so that his death was then' no

now to mention some circumstances''vhi~h occur-
red in the course of that time, previously to which
I may state a·few things in relation to the practi·
ces there. ·
Dr. Nelson commonly paid his morning visit at
about nine o'clock, and after he was gone, the office
of the Virgin Mary was performed, which occupi-
ed a long time, and consisted of many prayers, &c.,
attended with various and tiresome postures, whic~
often quite exhausted my strength. . We· would

Dr. Nelson had often much to say to the Supe-
rior. But one day I observed him in conversation
with her, after he had visited the sick, at a time
when I wished him away. It was Monday morn
ing; and then there was always an additional
amount of work to be done, and more hurry than
usual in doing it: for at that time more priests
than on other days come into the nunnery; and a$
they frequently passed through the sick-room, the
Superior wished to have every thing in good or·
der. The sheets were changed on that day, and
the Superior, who was always particular in hav·
ing things right there, would insist on our being
quick.
.- ·It mqst have been on a Monday morning when I
saw the Doctor talking with the Superior, because.
I remember that when I saw him, I thought he
would interfere with my prompt performance of
the laborious task I had before me. The Superior
soon called me to her, and, I rememter, used a
term which she often did when disposed to coax us
to any thing- ·
. "Vien a ta m~re, rna petite-fi1le.11
(Come to
yout mother, my little daughter.)
I approached her, and she made me take a seat.
between her and the Doctor, when she informed
me that she had something to say which I must not
repeat. ".The Doctor," said she, " wants the corpse
of St. Agnes, and will give forty dollars for it. He
will come this ~ven.ing to get it ; and when all is

:nention any thing of this to the old nuns, for they
will tell the Bishop."
She then gave me two keys, which I took; and
hen attended to the work I had to do. That even·
ing, at about half past nine, I went down to the
Superior's room, ready, in case of meeting any one
by the way who might question me, to say that I
was on business to the Superior, as she had told
me to answer. I was surprised to find Dr. Nelson
with her. They both rose, and proceeded with
me through the first story, to the little covered pas-
sage leading into the sacristy. Crossing that, we
came to a door at the corner, which I had never
noticed before; and that the Superior intended to
open, but found she had left the key behind. She
therefore made me and the doctor wait while she
returned to get it ; but after a time she came back,
h:wing been unable to find it.
The Superior then said that we must go another
way; and leading us t~ the door which opens into
the church of the Convent, went under the altar
and raised a trapdoor. Below this was another,
fastened by a large iron bolt, which the doctor re-
moved ; and beneath we saw the steps which...led
into the vaults. ·
I had be,en in the vaults before, but not by this
tvay. There is a.trapdoor in the floor of the
thurch, not far, I should ·think, from the middle,
~ut ~earer the altar than the front door ; and by
.nat I had gone down on some occasions of burial.
The steps were carpeted: One night, I recollect,
178 BLACK NUNNERY.
I was s~nt there with !Ome others, in consequence
of the l·~1m1 of the Superior, who thought old Susan
might havo ·eft some fire there, as she had gone
down with a light. I well remember the dread
with which I passed along the gloomy place, and •
the th0ught thnt some of the many dead persons
there might riso and catch hold of me.
But to return to the occasion of which I was
speaking. The doctor, I remember, remarked
that he had never been there before. When he
had opened the door, he came up, and going to the
front door of the church, called in two men who
were waiting there, and then we all went down
together. The smell of the place was oppressive
and disagreeable, as I had before found it. The
men took the coffin of Sainte Agnes, brought it up,
,and carried it into the street. The Superior and
myself accompanied them to the door. It was a
·hateful night, the air, I recollect, was cold; and I
stood a little behind the Superior, till the doctor
·and his men were gone; when she closed the door,
and locked and bolted it. The handle, I recollect,
was brass, and the inside considerably ornamented.
Some things occurred in the nunnery which I
never fully understood. There was a dreadful
alarm one night, during my attendance in the sick
rooin, tho recollection of which is very painful to
me. While I was sitting up, I heard shrieks at
some distance, but so loud that I sprung up imme-
.diately, as did all the sictk nuns who were able.

turn to their beds nod lie down ; for I knew th'
Superior ":ould blame me severely, if she should
come in and find them in such confusion. The
screams, however, continued, and they would not
• pay any attention to me, until they ceased, which
they did in a short time. They then lay down,
and every thing became pretty tranquil again. It
was very plain, however, that the curiosity of all
was excited by so extraordinary a noise, though
they were not allowed to talk about it, and of
course kept silence. My first thought wa8, that
some person was undergoing great suffering in the
little room to which I have several times referred
in my first volume, as the room of the three states,
or the Purgatory chamber : but the sounds seemed
too distant for that, and I presumed the sufferer,
whoever it was, must be farther off in some apart-
ment in that direction. There was a shrillness in
the sounds at first that made me think the voice that
of a nun ; but they afterwards seemed more like
that of a man.
"While I was reflecting on the subject, after the
lapse of a short time, the Superior opened the door;
and passed rapidly through the sick-room, accom-
panied by a few old nuns, without speaking a word:
She afterwards passed again and again. The last
time she passed, I was in the sitting-room ;· and it
happened, (owing to her flurry, as I presume,)
that she locked the door that led into: the· siek•.
room. A few moments after, the screams began
again, more loud and dreadful than before, so that
180 BLACK Nn~NJmV .
l sprung up and pulled at the door, to pr""'nt
another scene of confusion among tho sick nuns,
and then first found it locked. I could hear them
moving, and perceived that they were in a dread-
ful state of horror. Every moment the shrieks
seemed more terrific, till it appeared as if several
voices were mingled, at their highest pitch. At
length they ceased, and I never heard a word said
on the subject afterwards, nor obtained any light
whatever of the origin or cause. The night I
l spent seems to me one of the most dreadful I can
recollect in the whole course of my life.
I have seen the short letter from Dr. Nelson,
(the nunnery physician,) which is inserted in the
book called "Awful Exposure," published by Messrs.
Jones & Leclerc, in opposition to my "Awful Dis-
dosures ;" and as he professes never to have seen
me in that institution, it has occurred to me·that I
may assist his memory, not only by narrating the
preceding account of our visit to the vaults of the
church to obtain the body of Sainte Agnes, but by
requesting his attention to other circumsnnces
which he can hardly have forgotten.
· I would therefore address myself particu'.arly to
Dr. Nelson, and ask him if he remembe:.·s, about
the spring of 1834, entering the nuns' sick-room,
(No. 4,·in the second story of my plan of the veile11
department,) and speaking \vith a patient who occu-
pied· the bed in the cornet on the right han~.

been sent by him before with messages about medi-
cines, &c.~ Does he remember, that after speaking
and lqughing with several patients, and saying

they both knew,) he spoke with the sick nun first

nun to whom he gave the message~ Ifnot, I can
assist him. Her name was Maria Monk.
Perhaps he may have forgotten also in what
place he commonly washed his hands, and what
he said one day to a nun as she handed him a tow-
el. Also, the oranges he brought in privately for
little Betsey, and his request to have them placed
in the cupboard, to be given to her a few at a time,
to avoid the notice of the Superior.
For that young girl, little Betsey, I felt, and al-
ways shall feel, a peculiar interest. She had beau-
tiful black eyes, was remarkably handsome, and

her disposition was to be friendly nnd true. I did
not mention her in my first volume, lest I should
be the cause of h,.·.r suffering in some way or other.
It is not my intention now to add more than a sin-
gle paragraph respecting her.
She told me one day, that in consideration of a
sum of money paid to Father Dufresne, by a young
officer, whose name she mentioned, he was allow-
ed to take her from the nunnery, and place her in
a hired lodging in a part of the Governmelt
House, not under my motner's charge, where she
I remained for several weeks. She was present at
·the theatre and at other public places, where sha
apreared under a feigned character, and was after-
wards brought back to the nunnery, as a large sum
of money was pledged for her restoration. ,.

I WAll always fond of music from a child. I
have never received much instruction even in sing·
ing: my only teachers having been a few priests,
llho, as I mentioned in my first volume, used occa-
&onally to come into the nunnery on Saturdays,
and lead the nuns in performing some of the chant~
and hymns which were used in the chapel
In my childhood I heard a variety of songs, par-
ticularly among the Canadians, and in the French
enguage ; but in the nunnery I often used to hear
the priests smg a number which we:re entirely new
to me. All these contained expressions more o~
less disgusting and immoral; and there is not one
- of them which I ha.ve been able to recal, that I
zhould be willing to see printed in full. Indeed,
although there are but few which I can now re-
memher entire, there are verses or lines in·all
which a regard to morality should n-ever allow me
b make known. A few specimens I have conclu·
ded to give, of such passages as are not objectiona.·
ble, with a general account of the nature and sub·
jccts of the rest, since I have been advised to do
so, by persons whose opinions I respect. .
I should remark, by the way of explaining why
BLACK NUNNJ!:RY.
I have never mentioned them before, that the
thought even of ~ll~ding to them in a book, never
occurred to me, until a:few·\Veeks before the pres·
ent ·volume was put to press. I had often.caught
IJlyselfsinging my infant to sleep with tunes I had
heard in-the nunnery; and my friends had fre-
quen~ly _
noticed that I sung airs with which they
were unacquainted... Bui I never mentioned the
peculiar c~aracter of.ilum1ery songs toany of them;
or repeated· If single verse of them, until one ·day
wheri the subjec't was introduced by accident, while
eonv.ersing about the fight that occurred between
1
Bish~p ·Lartigue, old Bonin, ·and other priests,
which I :have described in a previous chapter of
tliis- volume. · I then alluded to'the affray. I was
4uestioned.about its ·origin j and having mentioned
ll1e ~ffen'sive song which was the cause of it, I was
asked ·forothers. Se.veral persons, being informed of
their nature,·expressed the opinion that they con·
tained in themselves an importimt kind 'of evidence,
o.nd a'desire that something respecting them might
be introdu~ed into the present volume. After some
hesitation I consented ; and such extracts and ·re-
marks as seem proper, will be found· on the suc-
ceeding pages. ·
· '1 may remark, that those who have urged me to
lake this .step, have done so on the following
~rounds ;:_1st. That if it should prove that these

in the nunnery, which is the fact. .. 2d. That being
sung by priests, and in some C;;tses at.least,.c;omposed
y them, they afford witness to the ~uth ~f what I
have said of their character and conduct, 'thus con-
demning them out of their own ·mouths. . Certain
it is that they are very favorite songs with them,
especially some of the most objectionable ; as I
have heard them, in spite of myself1 repeated over
and over again, particularly when the priests were
engaged in drinking and gaming.
I am not w~ll acquainted with the French lan-
guage, and there are some words and lines here
which I do not understand, and cannot get explain-
ed. I never saw any of these songs on pqper' be-

all would ring again.

The parody on this hymn is so profane and
8hameless, that it used to shock me to hear it, for
it impressed me with the dreadful conviction, that
the priests were perfect infidels and atheists. I
felt certain that they would never have sung such
lhings if they had any belief in a God.

This describes a handsome priest-with the re·
lmark, that all the priests fall in love. Then it
speaks of-a young widow who came to live in his
parish, and attracted the attention of the confessors
on entering the church at high mass. The rest

quarrels the priests had about her.

CONCLUSION.
I HAVE n.ow concluded all the " further Disclo·
suree'' whi.ch I deem it important to 1
.nake, in rela-
tion to the Hotel Dieu Nunnery. There are many
incidents which have been brought to my memory,·
while I have been employed in preparing the pre-
ceding pages; and I might name Rnd describe
many other persons with whom I had some qc-
quamtance, or of whom I heard particulars of dif·
ferent kinds. It is necessary, however, to put some
limits to myself; and, although I may not be the
best judge of what is most important to be known
to my readers, I think I have not kept back any
thing indispensable to them.
So far as I have been able, consistently 'with.
truth, and the interests of many, I have endeavored
to avoid giving pain to individuals, by exposing
what I know, even though they be culpable, and
some ofthem highly so. My object has not been
wantonly to destroy peace ; and of this I think seve·
ral persons will be convinced when they find that
I have not mentioned in this book things which
they know I am acquainted with.
The public will easily understand why I did
not allude in my first volume tc the fact that I sa.w
