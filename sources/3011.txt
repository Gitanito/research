    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Occult Truth Seeker, The.
 Devoted to  Occult Phenomena and Spiritual Philosophy.
 1901?-1915?  Monthly
 Lawrence, KS; Tampa, then Ruskin, FL.  Publisher: Truth Seeker Publishing Co..  Editor: Edward E. Gore.
 1/1, 1903(?)-1915(?)  Fifty cents a year.  Advertisement in Banner of Light, 94/23, January 20, 1904, 5, Self-Cure, January 1904, The Social Thought, March 1903, Religio-Philosophical Journal, 1905, Now, 1915, and noted in exchanges of The Mazdaznan, 1904, and The Swastika, 1907.

 The advertisement for this in The Life, 1908, carries a picture of the editor together with the promise: "I will heal ONE CASE in each neighborhood, no matter what the disease or how serious, free of charge.  A healed case is my best advertisement."  The healing offered was what was called "distant psychic healing."  A few years later Gore was advertising in C.P. Christensen’s The Spiritualist, not to cure the afflicted, but to sell "Healing Mediums "his secrets" ("perfectly legitimate") to increase their income.  Gore was still advertising his services in Gale’s Magazine, October 1919: "Cancers!  Deposit $25 with your town banker, to be sent me when cured or returned if not cured.  Circular and information on request."         Issues:Occult Truth Seeker V3 N28 Sep 1903       </p>
