It all started back in late 2005. I was really depressed because of personal issues and also the winter blues. I was on medication for depression and a sleeping pill to help me sleep at night. One day I was sitting at home and my mind started to wander, thinking of miscellaneous items stuff, which started to get me more depressed. I took out my bottle of pills, opened it up, and counted how many pills were inside the bottle.  I counted sixty five pills. I poured them all into the cup of my hand and grabbed a glass of milk with my other hand. I sat there thinking of what I was about to do. I was about to go on the ultimate journey of a lifetime. I sat there wondering if I would be able to handle it. I opened my mouth, poured all sixty five pills into my mouth, and drank them down with the glass of milk. I set the glass of milk down and realized what I had just done. I realized I was going to die and I started to get frightened. There was no turning back now. They were all ready inside my stomach. I slowly laid down on the bed and covered up with the warm blanket. I said the prayer of ‘Now I lay me down to sleep’ and closed my eyes. 

The next thing I remember it was jet-black. The darkness was peaceful as it consumed my entire vision. I started to notice a pinhole of a white light. It was directly in front of me. As I sat there looking at this light, it started to grow in size. It became so large that my entire vision was now white except the top corners, which were still jet-black. A circle of the brightest white light I have ever seen before in my life. The white light was so bright, that I was unable to see anything in or around it. What I did notice was that even though it was bright, it did not hurt my eyes. I began hearing my name being chanted. It sounded like one person was chanting my name. I became confused, because I was not sure who was calling my name. I kept staring into the bright white light but I was unable to see anything.  

As I sat there staring into the bright white light, I noticed three figures starting to approach me with their arms stretched out. I tried to focus on them, but the light was still too intense. I still heard my name being chanted as these three figures started to approach me. It became louder and clearer as these figures became closer. I started to notice something odd; there were no feet on these figures. They were slowly gliding towards me chanting my name with their arms stretched out towards me. I sat there in awe as I watched them draw closer to me. As frightening as this scene may have been, I still was calm and at peace.  

These three figures stopped five feet in front of me. I took a quick glance at them to gather details about them. There were no hands, no feet, and also no faces. The faces were dark as the night sky. They began to start talking to me telling me that everything was going to be ok, and this was not my time to pass away, and that I had a purpose in life. But they did not say exactly what my purpose was. I tried speaking to them, but I was unable to talk. I stood there thinking to myself this is what death is really like. As I stood there, the bright white light started to shrink in size and the three figures disappeared into the white light as it shrunk in size. The white light shrunk in size quickly and the next thing I realize is that it is pitch black once again. 

The next thing I remember, I was waking up in the hospital bed with a room full of doctors and nurses standing around me cheering. I was in a semi-conscious state when I started to wake up. I noticed that my chest hurt badly and I was unable to move. I laid there in the hospital bed as all these doctors and nurses began doing all these tests on me. As the time grew on that night, I began asking the doctors questions about what happened to me. They all told me I was lucky to be alive and I asked them, ‘Why?’   They replied was that I had died on them four times that night. I sat there in bed thinking to myself about the journey I had just taken and how I survived the ultimate journey, Death.
