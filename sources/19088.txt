hello i&#39;m right here can you hear me
okay
all righty great i&#39;d like to introduce
the folks uh
eric hecker i&#39;m saying your name
correctly that is correct all right good
good
and uh it&#39;s an interesting uh program
we&#39;re gonna do um
it&#39;s really dealing with some
information that i first learned in the
90s
um
from a classified source who had
uh developed neutrino light detectors
that were being
placed on satellites in space in the
1973-75
time period
that were being used to track
extraterrestrial vehicles target them
hit them down them
the this particular man was a
electromagnetic genius at his own
company near tampa
when he developed the neutrino light
detectors he got a national security
order
um from the nro national reconnaissance
office runs a lot of these top-secret
satellite systems
and they confiscated the uh invention
and the technologies to use for
covert purposes which is uh actually
happens quite frequently
um
that is that that story
is
you know been confirmed by a number of
people
since then such as the man who recently
came forward out of the
technology management office in the
pentagon
um systems that were on satellites that
could target and did target uh during
the iraq war a certain volume of space
and they could switch on the satellite
and the aircraft in that zone once we
cleared our own
aircraft out would fall out of the sky
like rocks and crash and in fact that&#39;s
how most of saddam hussein&#39;s
air force was destroyed according to
this source inside the pentagon who had
baseline clearance across
about 18
of these top secret unacknowledged
special access projects
so
uh you know a lot of these are data
points
that i&#39;ve heard various aspects of a
couple months ago
with streets how to by
mr hecker and
he uh
told me about uh an incident for
that where he was involved uh involving
the south pole so i think eric if you
can give people assume everyone on this
call
or this show know absolutely nothing
um i i don&#39;t jump over into a lot of
technical gobbledygooks speak if you
don&#39;t mind cause nobody&#39;s i don&#39;t think
very few people are physicists or
electromagnetic engineers here
um uh you know this is a general
population and not
the physicists that we&#39;re talking to so
if you can just tell about what when and
where and what you saw and just go
through what you directly saw and
experience
you got it uh first and foremost let me
just let everybody know
i spent an entire year at the south pole
station on the maintenance crew
and the ice cube neutrino detector was
simply one facility of many that i paid
attention to there and
in that
process you know i obviously learned the
science and stuff like that like you
said it&#39;s a lot of mumbo jumbo that
people don&#39;t really need to know about
but that&#39;s the pretense that it&#39;s
presented to the world that the national
science foundation cut a check for this
facility at the south pole station and
is doing science wonderfully complex
science
but what i have come to find out
is that this device not only is it a
passive
observational scientific device that is
massive and embedded in the ice at the
south pole
it also
transmits i provide provided
documentation for it anybody can look it
up now it is referenceable on the
internet i call the dom document and
it&#39;s on the archives at my website but
what it states is that this device which
has five thousand 5160
doms which is a digital optical module
the idea is that it&#39;s observing the
neutrino
interaction when it hits the nucleus of
an ice molecule down there that&#39;s what
it&#39;s supposed to be built to do but i
found in the paperwork that each of
these doms
also can transmit up to 247
volts
per dom that makes this a giant
powerful
active phased array system which i am
now doing due diligence to let the world
know what that means and the
possibilities list is huge well so
before we go out it&#39;s too far let&#39;s just
deal with the basics here is what i was
wanting to talk about
i know you were there working for
raytheon
yes sir okay so let&#39;s go through that
you were assigned there for a year
working with raytheon it was your x to y
i mean just you know the whole thing
before we get into a lot of the
technical you got it so from from the so
november of 2010 i i landed on the ice
at mcmurdo station and was rapidly
deployed further south to 90 degrees at
the south pole station i stayed there
for the 365 days
that um
that employment that um
time period i guess was
for the the summer season we had about
uh we peaked out at close to 280
personnel at the site
in the summer season the winter season
we went down to 49
and the the neutrino detector was
something that i was pretty much
obligated to go out to every single day
the
the equipment was so much this is
another thing that i learned that&#39;s
peculiar is there&#39;s actually so much
computer processing equipment remember
this is the south pole station in the
winter time
my job required me to go out there and
and people laugh at me for this and get
bad but i say it we had chicken wire on
the air inlet duct like a snorkel duct
that the snorkel side went up and
connected to the building and there was
louvers there that were temperature
activated louvers
so the processing of these computers
made so much heat
that in order to cool it down they&#39;re
opening the louvers to transfer exterior
air in
to keep these computers cold people
really i mean think about that i mean
this is a building at the it&#39;s sometimes
minus 80 degrees outside to think that
you need that type of cooling capacity
and that was what my job was to make
sure this building wasn&#39;t overheating in
the middle of winter at the south pole
and uh
you won&#39;t you describe i know you&#39;ve
told me before but for the audience the
the size the depth of the array how big
it was how how far down under the ice it
was
etc i mean
see again i want to get you know so
people have a visual you&#39;ve got what
we&#39;re talking about here because
otherwise and you know none of this
makes any sense so you gotta you know
let&#39;s paint a picture
of the facility the size of the array
how deep it was
um you know and you know was it
operational when you got there or was it
operational later all that detail you
got it so first and foremost the the
central facility where all the
processing happens is sitting atop the
ice south pole station which is 10
300 feet actual elevation and that is
ice above
earth
so
the
the ice cube drillers first had to go
and drill they would steam drill down
and go basically two miles down close to
32 to 34 inch diameter hole and they
would drop a string cable down with all
of these doms on it
each one of those holes
was drilled down and it made a it was um
drilled in a giant hexagon that covered
kilometers of area in a length in width
dimension and then as far as the
depth going all the way down close to
close to earth at approximately two
miles
down to that
and
everything was cabled and went back to
the central building where all the
processing computer server towers were
and all that stuff and that was the
facility that was being accessed every
day and and made to be chilled
now apparently this was being uh built
and developed by uh raytheon is that
right
uh yes that&#39;s correct and the season
that i was there which was um so fall
2010 was when i arrived we transitioned
it was right around i think january or
february that
ice cube officially transitioned from
operation i&#39;m sorry from construction to
operations and maintenance same same
thing with the elevated station itself
actually that year
okay and uh
these
the system what what was what
what were we were the people there told
about why it was there and what it was
doing allegedly
the the
intended purpose for the ice cream ice
cream ice cube neutrino detector
was to detect neutrinos through the the
muon creation which was when a neutrino
coming from anywhere in any direction it
could be from the other side of the
planet from off planet through the
planet it doesn&#39;t matter
but when any of those neutrinos
smashes into the nucleus of the water
molecule which is in the extremely pure
ice there&#39;s nothing else in there so
that&#39;s kind of why they&#39;re doing it
because they they know it&#39;s a
concentration of something specific
which is just pure water great
great product when it hits the nucleus
there&#39;s two things that occur a blue
flash of light and the the neutrino and
the nucleus are destroyed
and a new product called a muon is
created
the detector is searching for the blue
flash of light
so whatever direction it comes from
it would um it would make like a like a
blast through the array that when it
would hit the nucleus it would be like
um
a reaction through all of the different
doms because they&#39;re optical modules and
they&#39;re receiving at that point on the
receiving end there&#39;s just a bloom that
shows up in the array and from that
bloom and the amount of light that hits
each dom they can triangulate the
direction from which the neutrino came
from
i was told that they would then take
that information
transmit it to all the different
telescopes in the world and then that
would allow them to then look because
they&#39;re so curious as to what neutrinos
are and where they come from
and and so that was uh
what they were telling you is that this
was a
observation technology uh
related to astrophysics or astronomy
somehow
absolutely that&#39;s correct yep
and what did you discover it actually is
used for
quite much more the the ability to
transmit is a big deal and i i know a
lot of people
may not necessarily understand what that
means so i want to you know i want to
paint a picture for them you know it&#39;s
it&#39;s one thing to say that you know and
the government does this all the time
they sidestep stuff
it would be like if somebody walked up
to you and they had something you&#39;d
never ever seen before in your life and
they&#39;re just simply calling it a bullet
carrier
you know it&#39;s a bullet carrier carries
bullets
but if they never told you it&#39;s a pistol
or a handgun
they&#39;re being rather deceptive in what
that thing does
and that&#39;s the way i now look at the ice
cube neutrino detector is that this is a
savagely different device from what i
was presented and i&#39;m trying to express
to the world what that means because it
is absolutely
a very big deal
so you
you&#39;re convinced it was also had not
only uh data gathering but also office
defensive weapon capability i i&#39;m
absolutely suggesting that that is still
on the list of things to to check into
i&#39;m a firm advocate of occam&#39;s razor
that every possibility is left on the
table and i have to assess each one and
the split second i can negate something
as a possibility i will apply occam&#39;s
razor cut it off and remove it but so
far everything that&#39;s left on the table
is still possible
yes there is we can get into that in a
moment but i&#39;m trying to stick with you
know the things that are factually
happening observed and then we can talk
about implications
uh and our assessment in a moment
uh what
i mean you told me a very interesting
thing that happened
the instant they switched this system on
the new zealand event
i i have i have a high suspicion that
this is when it was going active and
they were dialing things in
and that they caused the christchurch
accident
that was there
you&#39;re referring to the earthquake
absolutely yes
yep i believe that they were dialing it
in
and there was a high probability that
that was just um
a misfire
and a side effect see one of the things
people just give a little background a
lot of people have heard me refer in the
past of
scalar and longitudinal
um
uh electromagnetic uh energy
which just give people not to geek out
too far here but
you know when you look at a normal light
wavelength there&#39;s a wave to it like
this and a laser is coherent light where
all the green spectrum is lined up
when you&#39;re doing something um with the
longitudinal scalar waves are actually a
point that goes out longitudinally
without the wave and is uh much
faster than the speed of light literally
and the normal speed of light is still
it&#39;s still light still electromagnetic
field
but it also can be uh weaponized so the
early
one of the euphemisms that are used
you&#39;re talking about the euphemism of
this being some kind of you know like
a bullet carrier when really it&#39;s a gun
uh
people don&#39;t realize that when jagger
hoover was written to by the field agent
uh there in roswell
the memo we have that&#39;s now become the
most viewed document on the fbi website
officially
uh states that there was a new
quote radar array
at roswell
um in fact what that what that is often
used at people i i i
have here i&#39;m in washington right now
who have worked in these systems radar
is often a euphemism or a catch-all
phrase for not only a passive detection
of an aircraft or you know bouncing
waves off the metal skin of an aircraft
radar but also an active warfare system
and they will piggyback them together
so this is a common motif it&#39;s a it&#39;s a
pattern
that i&#39;ve seen over the last 30 years of
working in this area
and i know that is also true that the
operational systems that were not only
the neutrino light detectors on
satellites in the you know almost 50
years ago now early mid 70s
those were quotes slaved
to active systems that were longitudinal
scalar
directional energy weapon type systems
that would then lock on now why is that
important when an interstellar vehicle
is stepping down let&#39;s call it out of
trans-dimensional uh space-time you know
resonating beyond the speed of light
matter electrons as we think of it
that&#39;s that whole area of physics has
been kept secret when they are going
from that into this dimension full on
the very first thing that happens is a
big burst of neutrino light
and that&#39;s what those that&#39;s why the
national reconnaissance office
that runs uh all the really super secret
uh satellite systems up in space wanted
this man&#39;s invention and system back in
the early 70s
so
we know that those systems have been
used for
detection connected to
uh
offensive weapon
targeting purposes
for that long
i think it&#39;s a stepping the game up
quite a bit if in fact there is a
similar system ground base at the south
pole
and and one thing you mentioned i want
to emphasize neutrinos go straight
through the earth matter anywhere
unimpeded so it the fact that it&#39;s on
the south pole doesn&#39;t mean that it can
only pick up neutrino bursts that are
coming from the direction of the south
pole out into space it can pick it up
circumferentially everywhere
yep
yeah a lot of people make that error
yeah
i i actually have um an understanding my
my ex-father-in-law passed away but
before he passed away he had informed me
that when he was in the army way back
when in world war ii he was in a very
special detail that was working with
first microwave line of sight radar
excuse me
very special stuff he was um super top
secret they never left the country
and they were ordered
to write letters
as if they were in the european front
right right
yeah well a lot of people don&#39;t realize
that these sort of electromagnetic uh
fields and experimentation these go back
to the late 1800s
and the early 1900s if you if you look
at this historically this is why
you know i at some point uh maybe in the
near future i want to work on
uh a documentary that&#39;s a you know a
special two-hour deep dive going back
over 100 years
on the sort of hidden
electromagnetic and related technologies
you know because obviously they can be
used to tap into the so-called zero
point or quantum vacuum and give us free
energy and save the biosphere
but
you know i always say this as a medical
doctor emergency doctor that you you
know you can take a knife to put
butter on your bread or to slice
someone&#39;s throat and unfortunately
um the latter
is what&#39;s been going on in these covert
programs because they&#39;ve all been
hoovered up like a giant vacuum cleaner
uh into a covert unacknowledged special
access projects
and
developed for military purposes and this
is an enormous problem because most of
those sort of systems by the way
you know if you bring something like
this up to
someone you know in the white house or
even most directors of the cia and and
or members of congress and intelligence
committee they know absolutely nothing i
mean when i say nothing i mean zero
about this
that&#39;s a problem i mean it&#39;s a huge
problem because there&#39;s no oversight
on it so tell us a little bit more of
what your your research into this has
uncovered and
any other people that you&#39;ve stayed in
touch with who have still worked in that
facility and
and with the status of it now 10 years
on
i think it&#39;s perfect where you were just
at because i think the reason those
people are ignorant about these types of
projects is because of
compartmentalization of information
it&#39;s amazing because here i am somebody
who actually wintered at the south pole
station
and from a crew i mean these are limited
numbers of people on the planet that do
this and even up that crew i&#39;m one of
the few that was able to see through the
compartments so yes i&#39;ve actually i&#39;ve
stayed in contact with people because a
lot of this has been
getting in touch with folks and saying
hey you know what you remember that time
that such and such happened yeah and we
had to respond and this was what we were
told and this was what was going on what
if we look at it this way i need to talk
to you so a lot of that has happened
i&#39;ve absolutely been in touch with a lot
of the hands from my crew
one of the main reasons that i&#39;m coming
forward is because i&#39;ve maintained that
contact and i do believe these people
have been negatively impacted by what i
believe are now called directed energy
weapons
that you know that
people have suffered there are
physical things that happen to people
that are near this equipment
when they&#39;re
figuring out how it works right and then
also i believe that because we had a
potential to go offensively i believe
there&#39;s a potential for us to have been
attacked
now what do you what kind of symptoms
you&#39;re referring on now to
sort of biological and brainwave um
problems that people have had i know we
talked about this before when i first
had a conversation with you can you go
into that what sort of sequela we&#39;d say
in medicine have people experienced
uh a lot of it has to do with the list
of things that are coming out now on the
um havana syndrome list so i apologize
for not having all the medical
terminology correct
i&#39;m just dealing with the folks and what
they&#39;re telling me we&#39;re having they&#39;re
having memory issues
they&#39;re having a lot of trouble sleeping
they&#39;re having um issues with
temperature uh rise out of nowhere these
things are all peculiar to me i mean i&#39;m
not trying to justify it or anything i&#39;m
just telling you what people are griping
and this is
becoming more and more prevalent it&#39;s
kind of why i came out of the shadows
because i was noticing this in my life
in my crew but now i&#39;m seeing things
like since last we spoke we have the
directed energy threat emergency
response act has come out as a house
resolution
you know the department of defense has
now has issued guidelines for their
personnel how to report these symptoms
internally so they can take care of it
appropriately right right so it&#39;s
getting very real in just the last
couple of weeks yeah
it&#39;s been a lot in the mainstream news
those of you who uh haven&#39;t heard about
this our embassy in havana had a lot of
personnel that had some kind of
a directional energy weapon targeted
them there&#39;s been more recent ones in
other countries um
at various facilities
and um they have experienced this whole
sort of constellation
of symptoms you know migraine
sleeplessness
um you know emotional instability
uh
you know big mood swings uh
you know and other physical problems
including what you know what you&#39;re
referring to
feeling like you&#39;re having a fever or
what have you now i remember this all
goes back to
this whole area of let&#39;s call it
forbidden science it deals with a scalar
longitudinal
trans-dimensional physics is is what has
been called that deal with these kinds
of uh electromagnetic fields is a little
i liken it a little bit to people
uh you know working unwittingly near the
hanford reactor
um you know and and ended up getting
radiation poisoning or
uh people who were near a downwind from
the plumes of the atomic bombs being
tested uh you know
there&#39;s a lot going on
and of course the government never wants
to admit that people are being injured
by anything like this they&#39;re doing
uh
because they don&#39;t even acknowledge the
project project exists this is one of
the big problems is that if you&#39;re not
going to even acknowledge the the fact
that these technologies are extant that
they&#39;re already all over the place
um and because they&#39;re that classified
then obviously you&#39;re going to deny the
symptomatology resulting from those
technologies being deployed or used even
if the the
negative effects on people are secondary
not the intended one although i will say
the so-called radionic psychotronic type
systems are not a mythology
those exist and have been developed
quite thoroughly over the last you know
70 80 years or more
and and are also um weapon systems
there&#39;s a there&#39;s a phrase in the
military when they come with systems
that maintain plausible deniability and
they say things like plausible
deniability must be maintained yes right
that means when there&#39;s collateral
damage and fallout
plausible deniability will be maintained
they&#39;re not going to discuss what
happened there will be a cover story
you&#39;ll get some swamp catch spiel yes
yes
absolutely
yeah so
what else have you discovered i know you
mentioned there was one supervisor
who was there a woman who who became
even while you were there became
seemingly unhinged
you just read my mind that was right
where i was going our our station
manager
was
made the news when we were there this is
all referenceable
she was having great issue i would just
say we&#39;ll put it that way
i&#39;m certainly not a doctor but i&#39;m a i&#39;m
a winter rover south pole expert and
from my knowledge and experience of
being a winter over at the south pole
she seemed to be in the throes of what
is
medically called winter over syndrome
they&#39;ve done studies there&#39;s a certain
mechanism of failure to the psyche that
occurs typically when you go down the
wrong path there i guess to say and she
seemed to be in that situation
and at the time
she was under the impression i believe
that she believed she had a stroke
but it it turned out that it didn&#39;t seem
she had a stroke i believe that she
believed it but i think this was again
an impact from something that occurred
during our winter season there that she
and others
um there was there was an event that
negatively impacted everybody we had a
we had a drill there was a drill out by
our
radio systems our a radio um array
and it was
her idea to set up a a
drill we had all kinds of response teams
fire teams medical teams and the idea
was in the harsh climate to test all of
our equipment and get out there long
story short is either a that equipment
wasn&#39;t properly isolated by accident
or on purpose
or some other
thing was going on and i still don&#39;t
know but that event
messed up a lot of folks oh okay
and the
you know the the powers that be want to
call it a whole bunch of other stuff but
that&#39;s just one singular event that i
know
that
it wasn&#39;t as presented people were
negatively impacted nobody was really
talking about it there was a lot of
compartmentalization
and i would i would say misinformation
and disinformation being spread around
because to this day i still don&#39;t know
exactly what happened there i&#39;m still
looking into it okay
and you know how many were there other
people at the base uh when they switched
the system on and this
christ church new zealand
devastating earthquake happened that
sort of sense like oops you know there&#39;s
something
related here
i would not have been in that info
stream at that time okay
but since then you&#39;ve learned to folks
who
yes yes that absolutely that was the
thought going on
because they they were very aware it was
rather rapid you know
i think when you when you pull the
trigger on something like that
you kind of know the target that you&#39;re
looking for and whether you hit the
bullseye or on the paper you&#39;re still
aware
so this array is two miles deep how far
across is it
oh it&#39;s a it&#39;s i would say
a couple of miles across okay
estimate
um i don&#39;t have it on this map here i&#39;m
sorry i have a different map yep
well the reason i bring that up i mean
this is not something i
a lot of times i&#39;ll have military and
intel or contractors come forward with
information
and i i sit on it until i get another
point of corroboration
because you know you don&#39;t want
something just be purely apocryphal
one-off as we say in science and end of
one
so uh
some years ago i was given a lecture in
um phoenix
and you know this commonly happened
there were hundreds of people there
and at the end of it there was this uh a
middle-aged man with two people with him
were clearly
with him as friends protectors
who waited till everyone cleared out
and he told me that he had been in
alaska
and deployed on a ship that was under
contract it was a private corporation
uh
under contract with the national
security agency
and uh this ship had a special scalar
electromagnetic system on it and they
went down to
uh the area off of indonesia over that
subduction zone
and when they turned that system on it
caused that massive earthquake
and it killed a quarter of a million
people
and he was so disturbed by this that he
went off the grid got an old car without
gps drove from alaska to phoenix with
these two security people to hand this
information off to me he was shaken i
mean he&#39;s
there&#39;s no question that he was telling
me the truth of what he knew about this
now you know again
whether that was an intentional or an
incidental event
the implication from him was that they
were testing a weapon system that could
destabilize uh unstable areas
of the earth&#39;s crust and to put them
past the tipping point
for an earthquake and and when you told
me this story about this system being
switched on
and the chrysler church uh earthquake
i put that in there with this
information from this
uh guy who is on the ship and witnessed
this happen
uh who took a lot of time and trouble to
try to hand this information off to us
i actually believe that a component like
that along with the component at the
south pole system is how these larger
systems actually work that it there&#39;s
this
something else going on because the
south pole station is relatively
stationary i mean granted a phase rate a
phased ray system like that has some
level of tunability as far as direction
but to have it be able to work in
conjunction with something else like
this floating system that you&#39;re talking
about is par for the course i mean
that&#39;s what i&#39;m finding doing the
research on the science is that
there&#39;s different ways um it&#39;s like
having a a a recording studio when you
connect the wire to this piece this way
and the other one this way you get
different functions
well in reality what i&#39;ve learned
you know over the years as people come
forward that they&#39;re based on
satellites in space
they&#39;re mobile on aircraft and ships
they&#39;re on land and they&#39;re under the
water there&#39;s a huge array under the
water
what some people would call the bermuda
triangle area
i have a military witness who was in a
hilo
helicopter military flying over that
area it was very clear and he could see
this massive array
uh it was very restricted area under the
the water
in the south atlantic their northern
caribbean
would this be like the sosus array is it
something similar to that
you know
he was not a technical guy he just said
there were these massive triangular
uh obviously electronic arrays that were
underneath the water visible i mean when
it was really clear water like that
and he didn&#39;t have any other information
at all it was an incidental
observation when he was being flown over
this restricted airspace
yeah it is my understanding that the
united states navy has a
a substantial amount of uh hydrophones
that they call um like so they call it
the celsius array that the
most of the oceans of the world they&#39;re
they&#39;re listening too passively
yeah this seemed more than that i you
know from what he described i suspect it
was uh both active and passive
um although they you know if it ever
leaked out i&#39;m sure they&#39;d say it was
purely a passive
data gathering system but that&#39;s you
that&#39;s the usual cover exactly
i&#39;m just spewing the navy commercial
right right
so uh
what else have you discovered since then
i know it&#39;s been a decade or so since
you left um
there&#39;s there&#39;s one more thing that i do
want to add about my time there that i
did discover now this is this is
something that i i don&#39;t have
documentation for the other things that
i&#39;ve been discussing so far i can
document but just in the standard of my
my work at the south pole station in my
experience i proved it the elf the extra
low frequency system
is also
energized i learned that firsthand when
i was there it&#39;s not something that can
document i didn&#39;t know at the time how
important it was but just um doing my
regular workload
i came across some equipment i had to
de-energize so safety&#39;s sake we have to
go over you know find the correct
circuit breaker panel lock out the
breaker panel you know put a lock on it
tag it you know make everything official
so everything&#39;s safe and nobody can hurt
themselves i&#39;m going through the
standard motions of doing this but now
in this sub panel that i&#39;m at i&#39;m
checking the circuits and it&#39;s you know
oh this is energized de-energized energy
and all of a sudden there&#39;s a there&#39;s a
switch that&#39;s out it&#39;s it&#39;s on when it&#39;s
supposed to be off
so now it gives me pause because
something&#39;s not right
so i&#39;m like all right i have to go check
with the engineer like what&#39;s going on
how come everything&#39;s not matching
at that point i become informed
that the elf breaker that&#39;s
on that i was under the impression it&#39;s
supposed to be off because it&#39;s off
that&#39;s what i was told it&#39;s off
i was wrong i was told it&#39;s on and it
stays on and it&#39;s supposed to be on so
go back to what you&#39;re doing
and i went back to what i was doing now
with full knowledge that the elf system
is not de-energized
and that&#39;s a big deal also so why don&#39;t
you tell people listening what elf is
what it can be used for what it does i
think a lot of people may have may not
be familiar with the science with elfs
elf is again going back like nikola
tesla type stuff and it&#39;s very complex
it&#39;s a huge antenna array again now
we&#39;re talking again miles and miles of
antenna embedded in the ice
one of the things that it could be used
for they said was used for way back when
was submarine communications globally
which is a really interesting thing
they&#39;re also stating to be using it for
science for the measuring of the
magnetos here which is very interesting
to certain aspects of science that i
love and what&#39;s been going on with the
temperature of our planet and many many
interesting things can be understood
from observing the medics neatos here
but again
since they&#39;re not telling anybody it&#39;s
on
i don&#39;t think it&#39;s being simply used for
such common things i think there&#39;s a
more nefarious aspect to this component
that&#39;s where i&#39;m at so far so what do
you think that could be used for that
would be
not just communication and passive
according to the work of dr james
giordano who gives us the new topic of
the the battlefield of the mind uh elf
and the south pole station&#39;s ice cube
neutrino detector these things are right
on the list of directed energy weapons
and v2k and all kinds of horrible things
that i don&#39;t want to think about but i
have to impress upon people that there
are
folks that think of these things that
like to manufacture these devices under
the pretense that well what if our
enemies come up with it first
you said v2k you want to tell people
what v2k means yes the v2k is voice to
skull and this is an actual technology
that&#39;s been around for quite some time
and it was even put to use in the um
desert storm conflict to disarm our
enemies there is a way to put a voice to
transmit into somebody else&#39;s head
in their own voice a message
so this is an interesting thing actually
because when you look on the list of the
havana syndrome stuff which they&#39;re now
actually calling ahi anomalous health
incidents which is a wonderful benign
term but the funny thing is is they keep
being very vague they&#39;re saying that on
the list of symptoms is people hearing
strange sounds
that&#39;s v2k folks they&#39;re not going to be
more specific than that right now but
what that means is they&#39;re hearing
information coming into their own head
in their own voice
i would suggest this is what our
ancestors were impressing upon us to
know thyself
when there was a technique that they
could do this by
contemporarily we&#39;re dealing with the
technology that can pull it off
well you know it&#39;s interesting it can
also be in someone else&#39;s voice um you
know
a lot of people uh you know if you look
carefully at the the what happened with
uh
carol rosin who was werner von braun&#39;s
spokesperson for the last four or five
years of her life
uh when he got sick he sent her out to
give his speeches
and she was had been a school teacher
and then became an aerospace uh one of
the first women aerospace industry
fairchild industries back in the 70s
and she she stood up and in front of
this huge gathering
to give his speech and this v2k
system switched on
but it was verner von braun speaking and
she just repeated what he was saying
and i mean most people would sound like
wow this sounds like a schizophrenia you
know as a doctor and uh you know someone
who in the emergency department have
seen plenty of
you know really severely mentally ill
people
um with delusional systems but no this
is a very specific system and it&#39;s not
tinfoil hat stuff this this has been
around for some time and remember that
was in 74 or 5 i think
um so uh that you know uh you can
imagine what you know 50 years or 70
years of
classified unacknowledged special access
projects trillions of dollars
of what the payoff has been in this
whole
basket of
technologies
sort of secret
uh highly classified technologies not
just energy and propulsion like we talk
about with
ufos et craft and man-made anti-gravity
vehicles
uh but also these other sort of systems
and uh back in the in in 93-45 when i
was first dealing with
president clinton and his cia director
and trying to get this stuff i said it&#39;s
not just that
it&#39;s not just that there are these
earth-saving
and life-saving technologies that are
being kept secret
it&#39;s that those same technologies
purposed repurposed
for harmful reasons or in the hands of
people who are unaccountable who have no
proper oversight
and who many of them that i&#39;ve known
over the years that are in these
programs are
quite frankly sociopaths uh and you know
for la or high functioning psychopaths
but so i think that you know you get
into it it&#39;s a very dangerous this kind
of secrecy
when those people have those sort of
technologies without any
moral ethical or oversight um of what
they&#39;re doing because they have free
reign you know who&#39;s looking into this
the senate intelligence committee the
president well they wouldn&#39;t even be
shown you know as one person said where
the
washroom is
with the projects dealing with this so
that&#39;s that&#39;s one of the really big
problems with this kind of extreme
secrecy that eisenhower recognized
that he knew that there were things
going on people think all this is all
newfangled i said look you know the big
the heyday
of massive breakthroughs and a lot of
this sort of science and technology
happened between the 20s and the 50s by
the 60s
many of these we already had field
propulsion so called anti-gravity we had
energy generation systems we had the v2k
capability we had psychotronics
radionics
elf i mean all kinds of things and
scalar and longitudinal systems that had
been deployed
early on when they downed the first uh
some of the early craft near roswell
which was the only nuclear atomic bomb
squadron in the world which is why the
ets were there very concerned about it
because they knew that we were doing
things when we detonate an atomic bomb
or worse a nuclear bomb
it there&#39;s the electromagnetic pulse
everyone knows about but there are the
other energy forms that are beyond uh
the speed of light
that are released that are actually
incredibly disruptive to to the
so-called super highway
of communication and travel interstellar
that&#39;s one of the things that tesla was
trying to get people to understand is
that you know even though we use hurt
scene wavelengths for everything that we
do it&#39;s not the only wavelength out
there there&#39;s so much more and that you
know like you were saying earlier the
scalar and the longitudinal that&#39;s you
know where he was going with with his
with his transformation of energy over
long distances it was simply
you know people are familiar with like
ac and dc transformation or a step up or
a step down transformer where you&#39;re
just simply using voltages all tesla was
doing was taking something from a
hertzian wavelength transforming it into
something else you call it scalar call
it longitudinal color whatever you want
to call it
it was a transformation
and then he would move it from one place
to another and transform it back which
is we do this with electricity all day
long in so many other ways right right
sure
yep exactly and you know this is this is
why
you know when nikola tesla died the fbi
came in like gangbusters and took all of
his papers out of his apartment
um i have a department of defense
document
the provenance of which is it was
officially released where the department
of defense was demanding that the fbi
turned those papers over to them because
they knew how important they were
yeah that was that what what happened
that
tesla&#39;s demise was really
inappropriate it wasn&#39;t supposed to go
down that way at all and i don&#39;t even
know how we&#39;re not um in any way trying
to
recover from that going down the wrong
path you know has anybody done due
diligence to try to get all those papers
back are we or are we just sitting here
confident that the government says
they&#39;re not around i mean i i myself
haven&#39;t done the legwork do you know of
anyone that&#39;s tried
not yet i mean i know for a fact that
the the fbi did get them now you know
here&#39;s what happens if you do a foia a
freedom of information act requests
because the nature of these not
acknowledged special access projects
these things get diverted
into a use app
that no foia officer in fact the
president and senate intelligence
committee chairman don&#39;t have access to
so if you send in a foia request people
think that&#39;s some sort of a magic bullet
that&#39;s going to open the vault for you
that&#39;s just delusional frankly it&#39;s
absolutely delusional
because they don&#39;t understand the level
of compartmentalization that is beyond
that um even the department of justice
when they were investigating a major
security breach
uh and it was being led out of the
technology management office and there
was a three-star general that i know who
was going to be prosecuted for violating
security at a
secure communication information
facility near fort sill oklahoma
he uh they could not pursue it because
the unacknowledged special access
project
refused to turn over the specifics of
what happened and where because it was
so highly classified that it was beyond
what even the most top-secret
prosecutors in the department of justice
would be given access to so the only
thing they could do is take a star off
the lapel of this guy and put him out to
pasture
so um it was what they did they
but i mean i know the details of that in
excruciating
information but but that gives you an
idea this is why when people go well we
can do a foia request and
now sometimes you know i mean even a
broken clock is right twice a day
um
you know somebody will release a tranche
of material of the documents and
there&#39;ll be some gems in it but to my
knowledge nobody has gotten
um you know pride out of the vault the
black vault
uh you know the the tesla papers that
the fbi absconded with
uh
when he died
yeah yet we seem to be living in a world
of where all of tesla&#39;s wildest uh
imaginations are just happening now in
the black projects
instead of you know for the benefit of
everyone like he intended sure and this
is the whole problem this is why i think
he died a very sad in a way bitter
person but i know so many people like
that i mean them some of the most
brilliant geniuses i have ever met have
spent most of their lives in a skiff
uh working under contract for some
corporation for the agency or whoever
but you know this sort of science and
technology this is the real problem
because you look at this world around us
and it&#39;s a faint shadow
of what it could be and should be
if these technologies were being used
for peaceful
energy generation and by the way these
same technologies that can create havana
syndrome type
uh
bad effects can be used for healing
and for good effects i mean speaking as
a doctor i&#39;ve seen this in an
underground facility i went to on the
mexican border near
el paso and i think this is another big
area of exploration but see the reason
that
you
