    Summary: &nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Brittan's Journal. Spiritual Science, Literature, Art and Inspiration.  The Dynamics of Subtile Agents; the Relations, Faculties and Functions of Mind; Philosophy of the Spiritual Life and World, and the Principles of Universal Progress. The Trumpets of the Angels are the Voices of the Reformers Other titles: Brittan's Journal of Spiritual Science, Literature, Art and Inspiration / Brittan's Quarterly Journal 1873-1874  Quarterly New York, NY.  Publisher: Standard Spiritual Library Association.  Editor: Samuel Byron Brittan (1815-1883).

 Corporate author:  Standard Spiritual Library Association 1/1, January 1873-2/4, October 1874.  6 1/2 x 11, 144 pp.  Illustrated by plates of prominent spiritualists (including Brittan himself) as frontispieces, and occasionally with musical scores.    Illustrated.  Though devoted to an intellectual approach to spiritualism, the journal and its editor were not immune to the sillier side of the phenomena.  In the first issue, Brittan himself wrote an article, "Invisible Artists" on the spirit art of Mrs. Miriam M. Thomas, and added a plate of the art so produced.  The journal featured the disquisitions of Brittan and Frances H. (Fanny) Green, and in volume two began a series on  "Living American Reformers" that featured vignettes on J.R. Buchanan, O.B. Frothingham; Lucretia Mott; Maria B. Hayden, M.D., and others. In reprinting the criticism of the journal in the New York Graphic, Brittan writes its most fitting epithet: "mortal patience is not sufficient to grapple with the tremendous essays written in an emancipated grammar . . . ."  "Reckoning with the Graphic," Brittan's Journal 2/2 (April 1874).  NY Historical Society; NY State Library; Los Angeles Public Library; University of Illinois; Brown University; LOC.
