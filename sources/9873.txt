  		              		Experience Description   

    We were playing a child game of squeezint each other. I apparently had such a lack of oxygen, that this might have been life-threatening.

  I was then passing out and my friend was putting me down to the ground.  Suddenly I saw myself lying on the ground in our living room. At the side of my head my friend was standing. My perspective of view was from above and I was looking down. My body was lying parallel to my point of view from the right (head) to the left (feet). Actually my perspective was impossible as I was looking down from a bigger height as the actual ceiling was. I guess about 4 meters. The real ceiling was a normal height of about 2.5 meters.

  My friend was moving at the side of my head, so it wasn't a fixed image.

  I had no pain or respiratory distress. Everything was relaxed.

  Then in the right upper angle of vision a bright shining circle appeared. From there came a squawking voice (like the voice of Mickey Mouse) that said to me that I could come if I wanted to. Everything would be okay. I knew that it would be very beautiful there. Harmony, knowledge, contentment. The light was very pleasant and bright, definitely of a white color. I also understood very well what my situation was, and I knew if I went into the light I would be dying. It was my decision to go or not. It was absolutely tempting, and the only thing that kept me from going were thoughts about my father. 

  I was thinking how badly my father would be mourning, and it's ONLY for this that I didn't go into the light.

  And then I came too immediately.

  My buddy was totally upset because of how long I was gone. Then I told him immediately.

NDE Elements:

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

The experience included:      Out of body experience  

Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  63/5000  The e.g. my friend stood at my head and did not knelt.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal   I think you mean the visual sight. It was bigger. All details were similar as in the daily vision, but with a much broader perspective.  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         On one hand, I had the greater visual perspective, and on the other hand, the knowledge about my condition and the aftermath of my possible decision. I just knew it.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     Time lost all meaning.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I think it was the same.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      That my friend was standing near the side of my head and wasn't kneeling for example.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain     I have seen this 'Passing into or through a tunnel'. I think that a 'passage' gets it better. With me nothing was dark or Passing into or through a tunnel like. But rather a brightly lit 'passage' that I didn't enter.  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

The experience included:       Unearthly light  

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         An unusually bright light  

Did you see an Unearthly light?         Yes   Pure white, very bright but not blinding. Very inviting.  

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         No       

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Absolute calm. Peace. Slight fear for my father.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         No  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about myself or others     I understood the context of what was just happening with me, completely. I believe I could have asked for answers about many questions, but I didn't do it, because it was of no importance.  

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life   As I wrote already, it was my decision to go into the light and experience the perfect harmony, or to return to the 'simple' life with its lumps and bumps and disharmony. The fear to see my father mourning me, made that I decided against the passage. Nobody forced or restrained me.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What importance did you place on your religious/spiritual life prior to your experience?         Not important to me  

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Unaffiliated- Atheist     

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Uncertain     Concerning religion nothing changed. About this I'm neutral. Concerning spirituality I'm not rejecting everything in the first place, but consider all aspects of it.  

What importance do you place on your religious/spiritual life after your experience?         Slightly important to me  

What is your religion now?         Unaffiliated- Atheist     

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     At 16 I was still very young and erratic, but clearly a natural scientist. I loved physics and chemistry. I was realist. With that, this experience was absolutely in contrast to my former understanding.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         No       The

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I heard a voice I could not identify   This voice was not Male nor Female. Rather squawking. But absolute peaceful, intelligible and clear.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Do you believe in the existence of God after your experience?         God does not exist  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

Did you believe that our earthly lives Are meaningful and significant prior to your experience?         Are meaningful and significant  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No     I did feel what it means to go to 'the other side' and so could compare it. Our life is edgy, hard, high in contrast and strenuous. The one on the 'other side' is soft, delicate, understanding.  

Did you believe in an afterlife prior to your experience?         An afterlife probably does not exist  

Do you believe in an afterlife after your experience?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     The total harmony and the great knowledge I was offered, means that life continues somehow after passing through the 'doorway'  

Did you fear death prior to your experience?         I moderately feared death  

Do you fear death after your experience?         I slightly fear death  

Were you fearful living your life prior to your experience?         Not fearful in living my earthly life  

Were you fearful living your life after your experience?         Not fearful in living my earthly life

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     I did feel what it means to go to 'the other side' and so could compare it. Our life is edgy, hard, high in contrast and strenuous. The one on the 'other side' is soft, delicate, understanding.  

Were you compassionate prior to your experience?         Greatly compassionate toward others  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Uncertain     The love for my father brought me back, and it was apparently stronger than the 'love' from the other side. I think. I'm not sure if my decision resulted from love or compassion.  

Were you compassionate after your experience?         Greatly compassionate toward others  

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Slight changes in my life     The thing is, that I was in the height of puberty. In full growth. So many things changed, that I can't say what of this was changed by the experience. Yet, I definitely believe more in spiritual, intangible things as before.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Uncertain   In order to describe what I saw I would have to draw it. The 'implanted' knowledge was even more far reaching, but not of importance for me at that moment. It was a feeling to know a great lot more.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  This experience in a way has shaped me. In this respect the memory of the experience is stronger. But everything is fading more and more. I also wrote down my experience somewhere, immediately after the experience. But I have to look for this document. I hope I will find it.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The experience itself shows, that there is still something waiting for us after death.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Before my experience I didn't know at all that something like an NDE existed. The later knowledge about NDE even confirmed my experience.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     Everything I saw from my perspective was correct. I even climbed on a ladder to be able to judge the view and perspective.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     Through reading and my own research, my experience kept being affirmed. I'm not a storyteller and still very interested in natural science-nevertheless I know what I experienced. No thought construct.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Uncertain   Last year my father died suddenly at the age of 74. He was reanimated following a pulmonary embolism. After the reanimation I arrived at the hospital. He was alive but without consciousness. I went to his bed, kissed him on his cheek and just said to him 'Everything is fine Dad'. At the same moment his heart stopped and he died.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         An upload for pictures, of our own sketches.
