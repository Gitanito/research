I asked that they not inject too much because I am very sensitive to it (which is true). Suddenly I'm sitting upright, I find myself in empty, cold but bright and dead quiet surroundings. I cough but fail to hear this. I begin to feel claustrophobic.

Suddenly I'm without a body and am overcome by a feeling of wellbeing; I know everything and yet nothing. This is it: death = life; LOVE! It is impossible for me to describe the feeling. I felt myself so connected to everything; it was so heavenly and easy! I didn't have to breathe; I didn't have to do anything, only BE! This wonderful feeling was so overwhelming I was almost glad to be dead; it will be heavenly at life's end.

I want to comfort people who lose someone but don't quite dare.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       No

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    But I was not taken seriously so I prefer not to talk openly about it. Two days afterwards I talked to a doctor but got a vague smile as a response.

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     Yes   I've read and heard of NDEs but doubt I was influenced by them; my experience came unexpectedly.

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real     It was unbelievable and I was thankful to have been permitted to feel something so wonderfully real and convincing.

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real     As above.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       I don't think we should grieve at anyone's passing; they live on and are oh so fortunate.
