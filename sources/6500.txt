     Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Spiritual Messenger, The.
 A Magazine Devoted to Spiritualism, Mesmerism, and Other Branches of Psychological Science.
 1858–1859  Monthly
 London, England.  Publisher: W. Horsell.  Editor: W. Carpenter.

 1/1, September 1858-May 1859.  The British Spiritual Telegraph, 284, notes no. 6 of this journal as having articles on  "Mesmerism versus Drugs," "The Exercise of the Will," etc.  Frank Podmore, Modern Spiritualism (1902), 2:24 says that "this was the private speculation of one Carpenter, a Mesmerist who conducted meetings every Sunday at Greenwich, at which a trance medium discoursed with a collection afterwards."  He notes that the lack of native British material to chronicle "was compensated by liberal importations from America."  Carpenter, in a letter to Medium and Daybreak in 1875, noted sadly that "the duties of compositor, editor, general correspondent, and publisher were centered in one individual" — himself.  A review of the new journal in the Cambridge Independent notes that "the publisher is Mr. Horsell, whose name is well known amongst vegetarians, teetotallers, and other extreme or eccentric sects," and concludes severely that "this particular form of imposture waxes bolder every day."
