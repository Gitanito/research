  		              		Experience Description   

   I was hopping a train and my legs were about to be cut off via catching them on the wheel.  I was so frightened, that my life flashed before my eyes in  a life review. 

   Within two seconds, my full life played before me and I felt as though I comprehended it all. I could not understand how I could do this and have pondered this ever since my experience. I’ve also had a few other God encounters: healing 1979; dreams: both dream occurred on back to back nights in October 1984 that led to personal salvation the following day.
