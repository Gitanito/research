  		              		Experience Description   

    Murdered by My Sister in September 1973

  In fall of 1973, at the University of Central Arkansas, I shared a college dorm room with my big sister. During the night, as I was sleeping, she gently turned me over from my side to laying on my back. She kneeled over me, and stabbed me in the chest with a large kitchen knife. When I felt the large hard object, up under my ribs, near my heart, my first thought was 'it’s mortal' 

  My spirit rose up above my body, to a place near the ceiling. As I was rising up, my first experience was sadness about what happened. Then, looking down on the scene. I saw my sister kneeling over my body, carefully checking my pulse. Another girl opened the door, and looked into the room. She had heard my sister scream, and asked if everything was OK. My sister said we were OK, and commanded her to leave. 

  From above the scene, I experienced a brief communication on the matter. Such as, an agreement that I had not achieved my mission yet. I questioned how I might be able to use that body anymore. I’m not sure at exactly what moment I reentered my body, or how my body was made whole again. It just happened. 

  During the night, the dorm mother and the other girl came into the room. They inspected my body. And were surprised to discover no apparent injuries. However, the bed and floor were soaked with a LOT of blood. The dorm mother asked 'Where did all that blood come from?'

  In the early morning, my sister called my parents crying hysterically. She reported that she had murdered me. She said it’s a big mess and she didn’t know what to do with the body. She was asking them for help. They didn’t believe her, and refused to help. I told my sister to tell them 'I’m alive.' She told my parents it was just my ghost.

  When it came time for class, I got up and got dressed, just like any other day. My sister was shocked and didn’t believe it. She demanded to see my chest, where the stab wound was supposed to be. She insisted on leaving together. We both tried to walk down the hallway to class, but I felt weak and dizzy. We agreed that I had lost a lot of blood. We were both too tired for school, so we went back to bed. It took a few days for me to build my strength back up to normal.

  There are a LOT more details regarding the clean-up, dorm mother, parents, and further attempts to end my life. 

  About a month later, the girl in the room below us, down stairs, showed me her ceiling, where the blood had flowed down along the wall, and stained her ceiling. She told me that was my blood. But I had blocked out the traumatic event and did not remember. 

  Gossip had spread around campus about what happened, but I was unable to answer questions. However, a special group of spiritual New Age kids invited me into their social group. Now, I had good friends to share conversation and adventures. I gained a sense of importance and belonging.

  Two Bodies Explained:

  Around 1970 - 1971, at Holloman AFB, NM, I talked to a German physicist about his ability to be in two places at once. He said there are 2 realities, which exist in the same place. They are almost identical, but not exactly the same. With just one's awareness, it is possible to have the use of two bodies. One of his was currently located in a different place. And the other one, who I was talking to. I asked him if the phenomena is like the 2 poles on a magnet. He said the principle is similar, but that’s not what it is. He said there are only 2 realities coexisting, no more than 2. 

  Others people using their alternate body:

  Around 1983 I met a beautiful and wealthy young woman, who had been murdered by her twin sister. She told me she did not know how or why she was alive. Her mother had kept her hidden her from her sister, so she would not be murdered again. However, I heard years later, she was murdered the second time, and her sister committed suicide in jail.

  Around 2009, in Iowa City, IA, I went to see Amma, a traveling saint from India. I saw 2 Indian women, who had survived death. Each with their deceased body still visible, in another dimension. There was a worried older woman, who looked peaceful in death. And a beautiful young woman, who had been hanged. I could see her stretched out neck, with her head laying sideways on her shoulder, in another dimension. She was walking, cheerfully talking to her young husband.

  About 3 years ago, I saw an older man dragging his right foot, but his manifest body walked normally. This man has no memory of any medical difficulties with is right foot.  About 10 years ago, I saw a woman, whose right hand was curled up and not responsive. She was aware of the presence of this alternate body. She talked about experiences of her illness and miraculous healing.

  Historical:

  There are many historical accounts of people rising from the dead. Which is why people hold a 'wake' and keep an eye on the dead body for a few days. In case it 'wakes up'

  Medical Psychic:

  In 2015, I had surgery at the University of Iowa Hospitals. Before the operation, my anesthesiologist came to talk to me. He said he could see injuries all over my body, from head to toe. The worst abuse he had ever seen. He asked me if I want to talk about it? I said his time is extremely valuable. There isn't enough time to describe it all. Just ask me a question about the most important thing. He said, he could see that I had been stabbed in the chest. He wanted very much to understand how I had survived it. He asked, 'Who murdered you?' I said I’ve been recovering repressed memories of extreme trauma for decades. I remember a LOT of abuse trauma. But I do not remember that one yet. He asked 'Who do you think?' I guess, it was probably my sister. She made the most attempts, and had the most access. He said, when you remember, please contact me and tell me, let me know what happened. Tell me how you survived. He told me how to say his name in Chinese. That his name would be in my medical record. So later, when I remembered, I sent the story to him, twice. Once through the surgeon, by email. Also, through the hospital snail mail system. I included a lot more information about the German physicist. Which goes into details about interdimensional research and development by the USAF. All that information is probably hidden somewhere in my medical records. And so, it has probably been read by University of Iowa Hospital personnel.

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   There is an interdimensional presence, who has always been with me. Someone who I talk to, and who helps me, in times of crisis. I believe it's my guardian angel. I have seen this being manifested, in a physical body, many times. This being has saved my life at other times.  This being is probably who I communicated with during this event. To whom I expressed feeling sad. Someone gave me the intuitive message that I have not accomplished my mission yet. Someone to whom I told; I do not see how I could use that body anymore. I did NOT hear a voice. I did NOT see any beings. But the presence felt familiar. Sometimes I feel the presence of other helpers.

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I was born with the experience of cosmic consciousness. Which was with me during this event.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     Someone familiar, interdimensional, on the other side, who helps me in a crisis, was there.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I know I have a special mission to accomplish in this lifetime.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     I was in agreement with the being who was helping me, that I had not completed my mission yet. I knew I had a mission for this lifetime.  

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     My physical body was dead, murdered. But I, my spirit, was still conscious and awake. I was watching the scene from several feet above. Someone familiar was with me.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     I do not know why some individuals are given another chance to fulfil their goals in life. And other individual’s lives end, before they complete their divine mission. Why some people have helper, who save them from death. Whereas others do not receive that assistance. I’ve been told this is because of good karma, acquired from past lives.  

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     I was in agreement with the being who was helping me, that I had not completed my mission yet.  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     Campus gossip got around. There was a small group of philosophical kids who reached out to include me in their group. Those friendships gave companionship, content and meaning to my life. The group leader saved me from ending my life.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes Absolutely. Because of campus gossip, I gained a great group of intellectual new friends, who nurtured me through college.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Uncertain   I blocked this out of my memory, along with a massive amount of other abuse trauma. I was unable to answer questions, because I did not remember.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I repressed traumatic events throughout my entire life. And have been recovering repressed memories for 30 years. Once a repressed memory is fully recovered and processed, it feels like a normal memory. During the process of filling out this form. I recovered the part where, at first, I first felt sad about having been murdered. Now, I can add that into the details.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     My new set of friends enriched my life with many wonderful experiences. I found myself stronger, more capable and with deeper experiences of consciousness.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          My role in society changed. I became important.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Around 2017, I sent this story to my anesthesiologist, as requested. I did not get a reply.  At the time of this event, there was gossip around campus. I was questioned. But was unable to remember the trauma at that time. This event did influence my life, because I gained a group of very good friends, as a result of this happening.  I did not remember that the reason I gained that group of friends was because of campus gossip, until filling out this form. Now, I can add that detail to my story.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Uncertain   I grew up in the Roman Catholic Church. Where there is a belief in life after death, rising from the dead, healing the sick. We have saints, angels and all sorts of beings on the 'other side'  

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably not real      I had almost no memory of the event. Because I blocked out all traumatic experiences. Except, I was able to carry on a conversation with the dorm mother about what to do, or not do, next. And I was able to avoid having it happen again.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     I have now recovered this repressed memory. And during the process of filling out this form, have filled in a few more details.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   OMG so many strange and mystical things have happened to me in this lifetime. I've met deities, manifested objects, fulfilled prophecies and predictions. As I said, my guardian angel saved my life, by transporting me to a different location. I've experienced levitation. Alternate dimensions of time. Visited other dimensions as described by others in NDE. I remember past lives.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Thank you for helping me remember a few more details, I had not realized before this process.
