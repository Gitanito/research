Foreword
The preparation of this vocabulary, and code, was sug
gested by the difficulty of assembling words having the same
significance, yet applying to dissimilar names or places under
numerous letters. As an example:
Under the alphabetical order of names and places it is diffi
cult to quickly refer to the names having the same meaning,
therefore, we have reversed the order, placing the meanings in
alphabetical continuity instead of the names.
This, however, only applies to the initial letter of the
words, which still leaves a partial alphabetical order for the
names under each letter.
One should use in conjunction with this arrangement the
usual Biblical dictionary, for quickly obtaining the meaning of
a given name or place. We have found this arrangement of
tremendous assistance in translations. We trust it may prove
an equal benefit to those who use it.
This code proves beyond all doubt or quibble, that, the
Bible, read literally, does not reveal its true significance, but
conceals a subtle meaning, of sinister purport, and wholly
irreligious.

may be an ornament, or a fetter.
Adorned by Jehovah. (Adaiah.)
Grandfather of Josiah, god-healed, the Lord burns, the fire
of the Lord. Josiah is the son of Amon, mystery, an Egyp
tian sun-god worshiped at ancient Thebes. Thebes means
the life of the god —life is symbolized by light. Egypt means
oppression and trouble. The suffix iah, or jah, always refers
to God as light or fire. Jah is also Jehovah, god, self -exalted,
self -raised— the sun.

tors. The son of Elmodam, meaning the measure. He was

ment. Addi is father of Melchi, king, counsel.
Answering. (Anah.)
Father-in-law of 'Esau, hairy, earthy. Esau is brother of
Jacob, the supplanter, the smooth man. Jacob becomes Israel,
the Church of Christ, who prevails with God. Anah also
means poor, afflicted. He is the son of Zibeon, the robber, a
Horite cave-dweller. Esau chose his wives from wickedness,
fear and poverty. (Gen. 36:2.)
Answer. (Anath.)
Father of Shamgar, the sword, astonished, stranger. Shamgar
is also Shomer, a keeper, prison. He slew 600 Philistines,
villagers with an ox-goad. He delivered Israel. Ox symbo
lizes burden. Sword means slaughter.

Jebus, trader, contempt. Read II Sam., 24.
Approaching. (Assos, Assus.)
Place from whence Paul, the church worker, was taken to
Mitylene, curtailed, associated with Mysia, criminal, abom
inable.
Afflicted by God. (Ath-aliah.)
The wicked wife of Jehoram, god-exalted. Aliah means
wickedness —see Alvah. She introduced the worship of
Baal, husband. This is duplicated in Ahab and Jezreel — (II
Kings, 10). Baal is Belus, the Sun, worshiped by the Phoe
nicians.
Avenging Help. (Azrikam.)
Descendant of Saul, the destroyer, the grave. Saul is the
Hebrew name of Paul, the church worker. Also a descendant
of Zerubbabel, meaning born in Babylon; mixture and con
fusion.
Affliction (son of ) . (Baanah.)
Co-murderer of Ish-bosheth, killed by David. Ish-bosheth
means man of shame, son of Saul, the grave. David is
named the father of Christ (Matt. 1:1). Saul is the Hebrew
name of Paul, the church-worker.
Alone. (Bedad.)
Father of Hadad, brave, noisy, rejoicing. Expression. Bedad
also means solitary in the bosom, thought, meditation. The

Scene of the massacre by Shalman, meaning Shalmaneser,
lenient, reward, compensation.
"Shalman (reward), spoiled Beth-Arbel. (Ambush) in the
day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her
children.
"So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wicked
ness." (Hosea 10:14-15.)
Bethel means the house of God. Compensation averts am
bush, snare, spoliation. Arbela was in Galilee, revolution.
Affliction (house of). (Bethany.)
Jesus went out of Galilee and lodged over night in Bethany,
Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 9
close to Beth phage. (Matt. 21 :17.) Here is a whole story.
Jesus here symbolizes the people. Galilee means revolution..
Bethany means house of affliction. Night means adversity,
affliction and ignorance. Bethphage means house of figs, fruits.
Here Jesus cursed the fig-tree because it had no fruit upon
it. The fig-tree brings forth fruit before it does leaves.
(Matt. 21:19.) Leaves symbolizes prosperity (Jer. 17:8),
and decay, (Job 13:25). "The first fruit belongs to God,
the priesthood, symbolizing alternating prosperity and depres
sion of the people, with the church always provided for.
Jesus cursing the fig-tree plainly identifies the Christian
church as a money-grabbing enterprise.
All-seeing. (Colhozeh.)
Son of Hazaiah, whom God sees. Father of Shallum, re
venge. Father of Baruch, felicitation. Shallum slew Zach-
ariah and usurped his throne.
Age. (Elam.)
The son of Shem, name, fame. In the name Elam we have
a well defined presuggestion of the story of Jesus being the
son of the virgin Mary. The full significance of the name
is : A young priest, a virgin, a secret, an age. The doctrine
of the immaculate conception was not broached until a hun
dred years after the alleged birth of Jesus, and not until 1854
did Pope Pius IX issue a bull declaring it to be a permanent
article of faith. Neither Christ, Peter nor Paul ever preached
or heard of such a doctrine as the immaculate conception.
Away. (Eshtaol.)
Burial place of Samson, sunlike. Son, service, here the sec
ond time. This has some reference to the services of the
Christ character, the crucifixion and resurrection. He was
the son of Manoah, rest, a present. Naturally rest begets
strength. Although a judge of Israel, he indulged in ven
geance, slaughter and destruction of people and property be
cause of vexation and anger.
Ascent (of God). (Elealeh.)
The name means the ascension or offering of God, or burnt
offering of God. Read Num. 3.
Ass. (Emmor or Hamor.)
Father of Shechem, shoulder, portion, servitude. Shechem
was murdered by Simeon, obedience and Levi, restraint.
Alleluia. (Hallelujah.)
Praise ye Jehovah
—an ecstatic exclamation. The war-cry
10 Ecclesiastical Vocabulary
of the ancient Greeks was Eleleu, "the shining light." The
Hebrews added to this Jah making it Hallelujah! or Alleluia.
The Nuns of St. Mary's sing lully, lully lu as an ecstatic cry,
meaning the ever-existent light. A remembrance of sun-
worship. Even the ancient Peruvians, before they ever
heard of Christianity, shouted Hailli ! The Semitic for fire
and light is Ur from which are derived such Christian names
as Uriah (Urjah) meaning "God is my light or fire." The
evangelical hallelujah is pure hysterical bunk.
Alliance. (Heber.)
In Luke III, 35, this name is Eber, meaning passage, beyond,
fury, anger, wrath. From the word Eber, the one who had
passed over the Euphrates westward, is derived the name
Hebrew, meaning "seed" or descendants of "Abram the
Hebrew." The word Jew is merely an abbreviation of the
word Judah. Selah begat Eber and Eber begat Peleg and
Joktan. Selah means spoils. Eber is Heber, alliance. Peleg
means division. Joktan means weariness and disgust.
Answered. (Jaanai. )
A Gadite. Gad means armed and prepared.
Allotted. (Jahzeel.)

Adorned. (Jehoadah.)
The son of Ahaz, one who takes, or seizes, and possesses.
Jehoadah is a descendant of Saul, destroyer, sepulchre. Saul
is the Hebrew name for Paul, the church worker. Hence
the grave is an agent of the church.
Ancient. (Jeshishai.)
A gadite—armed and prepared.
Affliction. (Jachan.)
A gadite —armed and prepared.
Assembler. (Jeush.)
Son of Esau the hairy man. Jeush also means devoured,

Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 11
Kohathite priests. Brother to Gershon, exile, banishment,
change of pilgrimage. Brother of Merari, bitter, to provoke.
Almond. (Luz.)
The site of Bethel, the house of God. Almond means to
hasten. Luz also means separation, departure.
Anointed. (Messiah.)
Applied to regularly appointed priests and kings. The Greek
Kristos—the Christ of the Christian church. The Lord
commanded Moses to anoint the furnishings, pots and pans
of the tabernacle. Anoint means to smear with grease.
Active. (Oman.)
The Jebusite from whom David bought the threshing-floor.
The name also means their bow, rejoicing. The name is also
Auranah meaning Ark. Ark means a treasure chest.
Amiable. (Philetus.)
The convert whom Paul denounced for error. This error
consisted of the declaration that the resurrection was already
past, thereby overthrowing the faith of some. (II Tim. 2 :18.)
Afflicted. (Putiel.)
Father-in-law of Eleazor, the court. Eleazor was the father
of Phinehas, brazen mouth, the wicked son of Eli, proving
conclusively that the high priest was the god of Israel. Eli
is God, first high priest. (I. Sam. 1.)
Ancient. (Prisca.)
Paul's friend. Wife of Acquila. (II Tim. 4:19.)
Asked of God. (Salathiel.)
Son of Jechonias, Greek form of Jechoniah and Jehoiachin,
God appointed. Salathiel is Shealliel, father of Zerubbabel,
born in Babylon, meaning mixture and confusion.
Adversary. (Satan.)
A common noun, meaning enemy or adversary. Used as a
proper noun the name represents evil, chief of the evil spirits,
adversary of man ; the devil. It is by the use of such words,
in an attempt to exaggerate the importance of the Christian
theme, that its greatest fallacies are exposed. The word
Devil opposes the word God. In the Sanscrit the word God is
good and the word Devil is evil. The words ill, hell and evil
originally meant good, as Devil, Lucifer and Demon once
implied "Resplendent Living God," the "Lord of Light,
the Living Fire," and "Resplendent Sole One." The Gypsy
name for God is still devel. The French for hell is enfer,
the one fire. Evil and devil originally had a good signifi
12 Ecclesiastical Vocabulary
cance. Perhaps the most convincing evidence of untruth in
the Christian teachings is found in the origin of its heaven
and God. Holes, caves and trees were the first places of
refuge for men, hence these were sought as places of safety
from beasts and storms. Both hole and hill once meant God.
The French for hole is trou, which is equivalent to our true
or tree. A cave is a harbour, and the Latin for tree is arbor.
The root of cave, in the Gypsy is hev, meaning a hole, a
haven, also a water-hole or well. Heaven signifies a haven,
a place of rest and safety.
In Rev. 12:9, Satan is called the dragon, the serpent, the
tempter. Originally the dragon was called a wivern. There
is a beetle called weevil. Fundamentally the word weevil
is the same as devil and evil, resolving into wee evil.
Evil resolves into evi-'l.
Evi means desire. El means God.
Hence, the devil is the God of desire, and this suggested the
doctrine of original sin, having a purely sex significance.
The Christian devil is the symbolic serpent, the tempter
which prevailed with Eve, life. The ancients adopted the
serpent as the symbol of wisdom, ages before Christianity
was dreamed of. As the reducing of the masses of people
to a state of abject ignorance was the first vital step in the
establishing of the Christian enterprise, its bible antagonized
all things which opposed its purposes ; hence, the serpent be
came the devil and satan, because, the temptation of wisdom
and learning won the people away from Christianity. The
"dark ages" —486 to 1495 —attest.
Asked. (Sliaul.)
In Gen. 36:37 the name is Saul. In Gen. 46:10, the name
is Shaul, the son of Simeon. This is significant. Saul means
wished. Shaul means asked. Simeon means obedience.
Saul also means a destroyer, a sepulchre. The name is the
Hebrew name of Paul, the church worker. Saul, destroyer,
is the son of Kish, bow, hard, difficult, entangling. Bow
means arms and symbolizes war. That Saul stands for Paul
is corroborated by the statement that Kish, his father, is an
cestor of Mordecai, meaning small. One meaning of the
word Paul is small. But, where Paul signifies a worker, Mor
decai signifies the penitent, repentance, remorse, contrition.
Armed. (Shilhi.)
Grandfather of King Jehoshaphat, judged of God.
Assembly. (Sia.)
Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 13
Alert. (Simri.)
A merarite, meaning bitter, provoking.
Apple. (Tappuah.)
Descendant of Judah, praise. Near Hebron, society, friend
ship, enchantment. Between Ephraim, doubly fruitful, and
Manasseh, forgetfulness. Apple is used figuratively. (Prov.
7:2.) In Hebrew apple means bursting forth.
Arrow. (Tigris.)
Arrow means armed force. Between the Tigris, armed force,
and the Euphrates fructifying, lay Mesopotamia, meaning
between two rivers. In Hebrew Mesopotamia is Aram-Naha-
raim, meaning "Syria of the two rivers." Syria is the He
brew Aram. Syria means sublime, deceiving. Aram means
magnificance, one that deceives. This clearly interprets that,
between war and fructification lay deceit, exaltation, grandeur
and nobility. Here is a cue to the purpose of the crusades,
and endless wars, which have accompanied the Christian
exploitation.
Afflicted. (Unni.)
Unni also means the poor and afflicted, which seems to fit in
with the significance of Tigris.
Ambush. (Zereda.)
Native place of Jeroboam in the mountains of Ephraim.
Here is the story. Zereda also means the plan of power.
Jeroboam means fighting against the increasing of the people.
Ephraim means doubly fruitful. Mountains mean a state,
Christ's church. This clearly defines a progressive invasion
of established civil conditions, involving even the very life of
the people and human progression. It is an ambush, a trap,
a net.
The Almighty My Rock. (Zurishaddai.)
This is a natural culmination of this subtle scheme. Rock
means a place of safe refuge. Zur means rock. Zuri-el means
God is my rock. Strength. Shaddai means mighty. El-
Shaddai means "God Almighty." This was the name used
by the Hebrews for God, before "Jehovah." The last mean
ing Zurishaddai is splendor. Thus the letter "A" terminates
in splendor and glory.
14 Ecclesiastical Vocabulary

Ab means father, the will. El means God, good. God is
father=good will. Abel also means meadow=mead, a drink,

and development of mankind is made clear by the following:

Capital of Ionia. In I Macc. 8 :8, of the apocrypha Ionia is
India or Hodis, meaning praise, the law.
Doubly Fruitful. (Ephraim.)
Second son of Joseph. Here is a story. Jo means increase,
sephar means numbers. Hence increased numbers, the "pos
terity" begotten in Egypt by Joseph, became Ephraim, doubly
fruitful. Ephah means gloomy, weary. He was the first
son of Midian, strife. This is all precedent to the christian
scheme in which Joseph, increase, becomes the adopted father
of Jesus, who is born of Mary, rebellion. Increase and re
bellion carry Jesus into Egypt, oppression and trouble. Jesus
later takes refuge in Galilee, revolution, and, in John 11:54,
he retires to Ephraim, meaning doubly fruitful, which eluci
dates a mystery. The original Joseph meant increased pos
terity. "God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity
in the earth." Gen. 45 :7. "Fear not for am I in the
place of God." (Gen. 50:19). Following is the evolution
of Joseph, increase. Joseph, son of Jacob, supplanter, to
usurp. Joseph, son of Jonan, grace of the Lord, son of Eli-
akim, God avenges. Joseph, son of Juda, praise of the Lord.
This Juda was the son of Joanna, mercy of the Lord. Joseph,
son of Mattathias, gift of the Lord. Joseph, son of Heli-
Eli, God. This is the Joseph who fathers Jesus. He is called
a carpenter, meaning a builder, yet he is a priest. Exactly
as the original Joseph declared, posterity and increase take
the place of God, to save a chosen following of ecclesiasti-
cism, Jesus is the Greek form of Joshua, savior of the Jews.
Jo, increase, plus shua, wealth, is increased wealth. All these
Josephs are in the genealogical line of Jesus, with the ori
ginal father Jacob, the supplanter, who becomes Israel, the
Church of Christ. Increased grace —good will, divine favors.
Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 39
Increased praise —applause, exaltation, honor. Increased
Godliness —power. Increased numbers —masses of people.
Increased wealth —Joshua- Jesus-savior. This is absolutely
all there is to the God and the Jesus Christ characters in chris
tianity. Ecclesiasticism frankly admits that it is a system
of usurpation of power and wealth. It may well boast that
Ephraim, which conceals increased masses, and increased
wealth, well symbolizes doubly fruitful.
Desire. (Evi.)
Evi, is an alleged King of Midiam, strife. Desire begets a
multitude of troubles. If there is any doubt about the intent
and purpose of the christian scheme to force all nations and
peoples to contribute to its glory, read Haggai 2:7-8. "The
desire of all nations shall come : and I will fill this house with
glory saith the Lord." "The silver is mine, and the gold is

points of the law" well applies here.
Driver (Ass). (Harbona.)
Also his destruction.
The word Ass symbolizes patience, plodding, unquestioning,
unthinking humanity—a patient beast of burden. Hence the
plodding masses symbolize the ass upon which Christ entered
into Egypt, oppression and trouble, and into Jerusalem, the
church of God. The common people have borne the burden
of premeditated rebellion, revolution, and endless wars.

Death. (Merodach.)
Also bitter, contrition. A Babylonian god.
Merodach was identified with Jupiter as "King of the
heavens." He shepherded the stars, pasturing the gods like
sheep. He arranges the stars in their order and assigns to
them their respective duties. As appointer of the moon as
ruler of the night he is identified with Sin, from which Mt.
Sinai derives its name. Merodach is the Assyrian sun-god.
He is a mediator between gods and men. He was the god
who raised the dead to life.
One of the names of Merodach was Nerigal —the one fire, the
mighty God. In II Kings 17:30 we find reference to Ner-
gal, hero, a man-lion god of Assyria, meaning happiness.
Ner means lamp, the grandfather of Saul, the grave, evi
dencing a connection with Merodach as death.
Igal means redeemed, the spy of Issachar, which specifi
cally brings Merodach into the christian scheme as Ner-igal.
Here is a clear case of bringing into active participation in
the christian scheme a recognized Assyrian, and Babylonian
god.
It is interesting to examine the significance of the meaning
of Merodach, death. There are more than seventy references
to death in the Bible more or less contradictory.
"In death there is no remembrance of thee." (Ps. 6:5.)
"Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints."
(Ps. 116:15.)
"All they that hate me love death." (Prov. 8:36.)
This covert threat intimates that God can prevent death.
"There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain
the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death."
(Ecc. 8:8.)
"As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
alive." (I Cor. 15:22.)
We have previously shown that Christ is Kristos, the Greek
44 Ecclesiastical Vocabulary
form of the name Messiah merely signifying the initiation
into office of Hebrew priests.
"There shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying,
neither shall there be any more pain." (Rev. 21 :4.)
Here death is placed on a par with tears, sorrow and tempo
rary pain.
Then we have this assurance, that the other is all false-pre
tense.
"For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts;
even one thing befalleth them; as one dieth, so dieth the
other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no
preeminence above a beast. All go unto one place, all are
of the dust and all turn to dust again.
"Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and
the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth."
(Ecc. 3:19-20-21.) Here is common sense and reason con
tradicting frivolous imagination.
Delivered. (Meshezabeel.)
Dartman. (Methuselah.)

he has sent his death. Grandfather of Noah, rest, repose,

Deliverance. (Salvation.)
Salvation from the Latin salvatio. Act of saving from in

46 Ecclesiastical Vocabulary
tial is added to this word by its being adapted to the vernacu
lar of the Bible. "Redemption of man from the bondage
of sin" means nothing, for sin must be made by law.
"Where no law
is,
there
is
no transgression." (Rom. 4:15.)
"Salvation of man from eternal death,"
is
pure bunk.
"As a man dieth, so dieth the beast. All go to one place.
All are of dust and all turn to dust again." (Ecc. 3:19-20.)
The use of the word salvation was suggested to the church
by the ancient salvar—to free from risk. The custom was
for the servants to taste the food before serving to their
masters to guard against poisoning.
Disciples of Zadoc. (Sadducees.)
Zadoc means righteous, justified,
a
highpriest. He
is
the
son of Ahitub, brother of goodness, of the line of Eleazar,
help, court. Ahitub was the grandson of Eli, god.
Here we have something:
Ahitub
is
the son of Amariah, the word
of
the Lord, which
makes him the son
of
God, to be quoted with Christ, the
word
of
God.
"And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and
his name
is
called The Word
of
God." (Rev. 19:13.)
The word Elijah, meaning God
is
God, establishes that Eli
is
God, and that the Christian God, and the Hebrew Jehovah,
are one and the same. In the new testament, Elijah becomes
Elias, because Elijah, the Hebrew God could not pass over
Jordan, meaning descent and judgment. Eli
is
ascending.
A curious thing
is
found in
I
Sam. 4:4, Eli, God, upon
hearing bad news from the war, fell off his chair and broke
his neck. Isn't that
a
hot one?
His death extinguished his line of priests.
In II Kings
2,
Elijah
is
translated to heaven by
a
whirlwind
of fire, and by this prophecy remained in the mass
of
testi
mony in Gilead, and did not come over Jordan, but Elias
did come over as John, and the preacher took the place of
the prophet.
"John came preaching in the wilderness." (Matt. 3:1.)
Heaven means the ecclesiastical government.
Whirlwind means bloody wars.
Fire means judgments.
Gilead means the mass of testimony of the old testament.
Jordan means descent, river of judgment, that rejects judg
ment.

significant that in two Jewish families are found all of the
active characters essential to exploit the christian scheme.
The family of Jacob the supplanter, developing into Israel,
the church of Christ, and the family of Amram develop
ing into the rule by statutory laws.
Let us examine this last family in a group.

the executioners of all this hidden scheme.
Benaiah, son of the Lord, was over both the Cherethites
the executioners and the Pelethites, the judges and destroy
ers. (II Sam. 8:18.)

nifies will, possession, endowment. The Chaldaie form is

of God, the support of the Lord. Thus we are told that
the support of the church of God depends upon new gene
rations. She is also named the daughter of Zacharias, re
membered by Jehovah.
Jehovah means self-exalted, self-sustaining. Hence we shall
find the prefix beginning a long list of priestly attitudes

"Abraham who is the father of us all," (Rom. 4:16.) "For
our God is a consuming fire," (Heb. 12:29.) If there re
mains any doubt about the simple human process by which
the christian God is conjured out of nothing, a little analysis
will dispel it. "The law maketh men highpriests which have
infirmity ; but the word of the oath, which was since the law,
maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore," (Heb.
7:28.) Let us examine the workings of this formula. Mel
chizedec was such a highpriest, and he is called King of
Justice, a law interpreter, for justice is measured by the law.
"For where no law is there is no transgression." (Rom.
4:15.)
"So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high
priest; but he that said unto him, thou art my son, today I
have begotten thee." "As he saith in another place, thou art
a priest forever after the order of Melchizedec," (Heb.
5:5-6.) Melchizedec is acknowledged as a prototype of
Christ, (Heb. 5:7; Ps. 110:4.) This makes it clear that
Jesus Christ was neither King, priest, nor son of God, at the
time of his nativity. It was the oath of the Nazarite priest
which made Jesus the Son and the Christ, the "word of the
oath." The Nazarite priest simply means one who takes a
vow or oath to devote himself to the church. Elisheba, mean
ing her God is her oath, reveals a hidden aspect of this,
of much importance. £/i=God, Sheba=oa.th. She was
wife of Aaron, meaning teacher, enlightener. Now, it is
clear that the Nazarite priest includes in his vow the teaching
only of that put in his mouth by his superior, and this is the
"word of God," hence the priest upon taking his oath be
Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 59
comes the spoken word. This finds a precedent in, "The Lord
said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a God to Pharaoh;
and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet." (Exodus 7:1.)
"He shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be
to him instead of God," (Exodus 4:16.) "Thou shalt speak
unto him and put words in his mouth, and I will be with
thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what
ye shall do," (Exodus 4:15.) There is a tremendous pur
pose in this intrigue, against Pharaoh, who typifies estab
lished civil government. Previous to this drilling of Moses
and Aaron, symbolizing the law and enlightenment under the
control of the priesthood, the Israelites did not know Jehovah,
and God had to explain this delicate situation, for Jehovah
means self-exaltation, self-support, whereas, the church pre
viously had demanded support by tithes paid by the Jews.
"And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob,
by the name of God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah was
I not known to them," (Exodus 6:3.) The first covenant
required Abraham to pay a ten percent tax to Melchizedec.
This was renewed by a covenant with Jacob, the supplanter,
who becomes Israel, typifying the church of Christ. Jacob
named the church or house of God Bethel. (Gen. 28:19.)
Here we now have the significance of the oath or vow:
"And Jacob vowed a vow saying, if God will be with me and
keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat,
and raiment to put on—"then shall the Lord be my God;
"and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the
tenth unto thee," (Gen. 28:20-21-22.) Abraham had pre
viously made the same bargain with Melchizedek, (Heb.
7:4.) Now we have an established case. The tithe is an
enforced tax of one tenth of all income, from lands, and
herds, set apart for the Levites. A tenth of their tenth went
to the presiding priests. This practically is the precedent for
modern forms of taxation. The original taxation always
falls upon the producing masses. "Bread and raiment" is
called the wage of the priesthood. (Isa. 23:18.) The chris
tian scheme is admittedly a profession and calling, with the
character Jesus Christ as its leader and high priest. (Heb.
3:1.)
Father of Peace. (Absalom.)
Son of David, beloved. Killed his brother, Amnon, faith
ful and true. Attempted to usurp his father's throne. In
Matt. 1 : 1 Jesus Christ is called the son of David ; hence,
60 Ecclesiastical Vocabulary
these two fine specimens are, at least figuratively, the broth
ers of Christ. The reason for Absalom's killing his brother
was that Amnon had willfully outraged their sister Tamar,
then repudiated her. They inherited their murderous traits.
David himself had Uriah killed that he might prostitute his
wife Bathsheba, who bare him a bastard child which God
ordered killed to shield the reputation of the church. Solo
mon also was born of Bathsheba, and he continued the geneal
ogy of Christ. David and Solomon are the two most conspic
uous and sinful characters in the bible, yet they are lauded
to the sky by the blathering clergy.
Fortress. (Accad.)
Also a pitcher, a sparkle. A city built by Nimrod, rebellion.
Field of Blood. (Aceldama.)
Field near Jerusalem purchased with Juda's betrayal money,
and in which he violently died, but bought by the priests as
a potter's field, (Matt. 27 :7.) Judas is but the Greek form of
Judah, meaning praise, approval, to glorify. Iscariot, or of
Kerioth, is the essential part of the play of Christ's betrayal.
Iscariot means the man of the bag, or murder. Judas Is
cariot was a clean cut fake, the one to hold the bag in this
plot. He is called Barsabas, which means Joseph, increase.
Kerioth means the callings. The calling of Judas was mur
der. Jesus Christ symbolized humanity, and, in due time,
increase would submerge the individual Christ idea. Joseph,
increase, and Judah, praise, are disguised in Barsabas, son
of the oath, swearing, son of return, son of rest. Rest
means cessation, tranquility. Return means to reappear, a
suggestion of the reappearance of Christ.
False. (Achzib.)
Also liar, one that runs, delay. A town of Judah, praise,
also of Asher, happy.
Fire-God. (Adalia.)

ernment.

Filiation of God. (Bcthuel.)
Beth means house, temple, Uel means the will of God. Filia
tion means the fixing of a bastard child on some one as its
father. Bethuel also means the sonship of God. Jesus Christ
is worshipped as God, and the son of God (Matt. 4:3.) This
is disputed by Jesus himself, who declares he is the son of
man (Matt. 8:20.) In Matt. 1 :1 Jesus Christ is said to be
the son of David, personified sexual love. Now, who is the
father, and who is the goat? This is bringing something
pretty close home. Mary, the alleged mother of Jesus, was
found with child at the age of fourteen, while yet held in the
temple. The alleged immaculate conception was not men
tioned until a hundred years after the alleged birth of Christ,
and was not canonized for many centuries thereafter, be
cause it was wholly contrary to nature and common sense.
Foreigners. (Bileam.)
A town of Manasseh, forgetting. Manasseh is the first son

Fear. (Gether.)
Press of inquiry, the vale of trial, searching. Son of Aram,
deceiving, magnificence. (Gen. 10:23.) Aram is the Hebrew
form of Syria, deceit. In I Chron. 1 :17, Gether is named
the son of Shem, name, fame. Hence there is a distinction
between "children" and "sons." Shem's Children: Elam, a
young priest, a virgin, a secret, an age. (This undoubtedly
presages the "immaculate conception.") Asshur, one that is
happy. Arphaxad, a chaldean fortress, healer, releaser. Lud,
strife, maturity, generation. Aram, magnificence, deceiving.
These are the direct children of Shem, and their offspring
are named the sons of Shem. Gether, fear, the victim of
search and trial, is the offspring of Aram, deceit—a very
natural offspring.

tain range east of Esdraelon, which is the Greek form of
Jezreel, meaning the seed of God.

practice of the medicine man of making himself hideous to
frighten away disease. The makers of the bible didn't have
the nerve to openly use plagiarism, therefore, they concealed
it in the apocrypha (I Macc. 3:38.) Apocrypha means hid
den, concealed, yet these are canonized scripture.
66 Ecclesiastical Vocabulary
Fertile. (Habor.)
A tributary of the Euphrates, frucitfying. Here is a pretty
translation. "In the ninth year of salvation, the king of
happiness took the prison and carried the church of God away
into happiness, and placed them in fertility by the river of
fleeces, pastures and nourishment of the body and in the
city of covering and abundance." (II Kings 17:6.) In order
to render it convenient to translate this we shall here give the
names and their meanings :
Hoshea, one of the original names of Joshua, means salva
tion. (As Joshua it means increased wealth.)
Assyria means a state of happiness.
Samaria means a prison.
Haber means fertile, fertility.
Gozan means fleeces, flocks, pastures, nourishment.
Media means covering, abundance.
We should like to have some one attempt to refute this pal
pable concealment.
Flight. (Hagar.)
Also a stranger, filled with fear. Abraham's concubine who
bare him Ishmael, meaning the supplicant. This is an alle
gory typifying the law and bondage as frankly confessed in
Galatians 4:24-25. Agar or Hagar, meaning fear and flight,
is Sinai, meaning ambush, enmity. It also signifies Arabia,
a mixture of peoples, and Jerusalem, the church of God,
which is free, and which is the mother of us all. This specifi
cally has secret reference to the flight of the fearful people
into the wilderness of newly discovered countries under the
guidance of the church. A very significant thing is here
revealed. Jerusalem is merely a disguising name of the
church—the mother of us all, whereas, in Romans 4:16 Abra
ham is the father of us all. If these things are not true, the
bible is not true. If they are true we are all Jews, for "Abra
ham the Hebrew" founded the Jewish nation. In Jesus we
are commanded to worship a Jewish God for Jesus is but
the Greek form of Joshua. /o=increase, S/iwa=wealth,
meaning increased wealth as the savior of mankind.
Festive. (Haggai.)
Also a solemn feast. This presages the church festivals which
are a sop, and limited relaxation and license, to the ignorant
masses under moral bondage to the will of the church. Hag
gai is a minor prophet whose book in the bible exhorts the
Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 67
Jews to crown the work of Zerubbable who symbolizes mix
ture and confusion.

Also means anger, heat, a wall. A chief city of Syria, am
bush, enmity.

Fatness. (Hashmona.)
Also embassy, diligence, enumeration. Evidently a fat, polit
ical job.
Fear. (Hathath.)
Son of Othniel, the time of God, the houfof God. There is
here a most significant concealment. In Joshua 15:16-17
may be found: "And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-
sepher, and taketh
it,
to him will
I
give Achsah, my daughter
to wife. "And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of
Caleb took it." Caleb means capable, dog. Kirjath-sepher
means the city of books, and letters. Achsah, decoration,
golden bells on anklets and priestly robes. This presaged the
deadly ecclesiastical assault upon learning, during which all
books and writings were gathered and burned.
Friendship. (Hebron.)
Also society, fellowship, enchantment, charm, captivating,
fascinating, to spellbind. The greatest hypocrisy of ecclesi-
asticism. This was the establishment of the hypnotic influence
of priestly glamor over the congregation, church festivals
grew out of this. Hebron
is
the son of Kohath, the assembly,
the congregation, to make blunt, obedience. Kohath
is
the
second son of Levi, restraint. Here we have the first inti
mation of the modern blue-law restraints secretly imposed
upon society through deceit and hypocrisy.

Also their armv, a dream, trouble, expectation. Also
a
bat
tlefield.
Fertile. (Helbon.)
A city of Syria, ambush, enmity. Also means fatness, milky.
Fear. (Heth.)
Also trembling. This
is
significant. "Canaan begat Sidon
his firstborn, and Heth." (Gen. 10:15.) Sidon
is
Zidon,
68 Ecclesiastical Vocabulary
meaning hunting, fishing, therefore it refers to the savage
life in new countries. Naturally, Heth, fear, would be a
part of this. Canaan means trading, doubtless with the

take their cue from this. Christ is symbolized by a fish.
The earliest observation of the eucharist was by eating fish.

Father. (Patriarch.)
Father of the family. Hebrew form of government till
Moses established the theocracy and the law. It was a sad
day for humanity when control by universal law displaced the
family as a unit of control. When Christ declared that he
came to set the son and daughter at variance against their
parents this is what he meant. (Matt. 10:35.) "There is
one law giver" — (Christ). (James 4:12.) The purpose of
a centralized government is very clearly revealed in Abra
ham the Patriarch, and Jacob (Israel) the church. Abraham
paid one-tenth of the spoils of his plundering expeditions to
the highpriest Melchizedek, king of justice—a type of Christ.
Jacob paid a tithe (a tenth) to the church of Christ the law
giver. Christ is head of the church and "a highpriest after
the order of Melchizedek." Much to her discredit, England
paid ten percentum of her income to the Church of Rome
72 Ecclesiastical Vocabulary
for more than two hundred years. As evidence that this
was improper England repudiated the Roman church.
Freedom. (Peleth.)
Also judge, destroyer. Father of the rebellious On, pain,
force, strong. Peleth is the son of Jonathan, John, meaning
mercy of the Lord, God given.
Face of God. (Phanuel, Penuel, Peniel.)
Also vision of God. Place where Jacob, wrestled with the
Angel. Jacob means the supplanter, to usurp by trickery.
Angel means a messenger, hence a minister or priest, the
wrestling signifying the struggle to convert to some cause.
It is easily known by the results what this wrestling bout
involved. Jacob changed the name of the place where he
slept from Luz, separation, to Bethel, the house of God. He
named the place where he wrestled Peniel, the vision of God,
because there he "saw God face to face," hence God was the
priest who converted him. Now for the bargain they struck.
Jacob made an oath that if he received permanent "bread
to eat and raiment to put on" he would become a follower
and servant of God, and agreed to pay the church one-tenth
of all that he collected. That this typifies the organization
of the church is evidenced by the name of Jacob being
changed to Israel, the church of God. (Gen. 28 and 32.)
There are a thousand parasitical, so-called charitable organ
izations being maintained on this principle in the United
States at the present time. Under the false-pretense of
Jacob being the father of twelve sons, in like manner, the
priesthood is organized. Out of this figurative bargain alleg
edly made with the Jews came christianity.
Five-fold Book. (Pentateuch.)
Greek name for the five O. T. books of Moses, called Torah,
"the law," by Hebrews.
Fiftieth Day. (Pentecost.)
Hebrew harvest-home festival, from the fiftieth day from
the Passover, or on the day of giving the law at Sinai. Sinai
means sin, ambush, according to the Syriac, enmity. The
Jewish Passover commemorates the "passing over" of the
Hebrew households by the destroying angel. The christian
passover is the "Lord's Supper," called eucharist, which,
originally, was celebrated by eating fish, hence, if the bread
of the modern eucharist is the flesh of Christ, the fish of
that period also was, and this accounts for the fish being a
symbol of Christ. And this is a part of the simple-minded
Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 73
hocus-pocus of religion, but a little more refined than savage
forms.
Friendship. (Philemon.)
Means affectionate kisser. A christian convert at Colosse,
punishment, correction, in Phrygia, dry, barren. A desire
to love and kiss is one of the vulgar elements in christian
association, a species of hysterical ecstacy.
Fugitive. (Phygellus.)
A christian pervert of Asia. (II Tim. 1:15.) Asia means
eastern, muddy, boggy. His associate was Hermogenes, be
gotten of Mercury, and lucre. Mercury was the God of
merchandizing and lucre is the filthy lucre, gold, the "root
of all evil." This simply meant that commerce and the rich
were not embracing christianity, for the simple reason that
Christ was only meant self-sacrifice, not for charity, but to
build up a new governing power.
Fla me. (Pildash .)
Son of Nahor, hoarse, hot, dry, angry, in short the storm.
Flame means lightning. God's anger and vengeance, thunder
means preaching, rain means doctrines. "My doctrine shall
drop as the rain." (Deut. 32:2.) Pildah's brothers are:
Cheshed, meaning gain, devil, a destroyer; Hazo, meaning
vision, delusion, dream; Jidloph, dropping, he that distils,
weeping. "My speech shall distil as the dew." (Deut. 32:2.)
Dew means conversions. Methuel, the sonship of God, filia
tion of God, the joining of hands, associated with, a partner
ship. Bethuel is the father of Rebekah, snare, trap. Rebekah
is mother of Jacob, supplanter, usurper. Jacob is Israel, the
church of God. Now read Gen. 28 to see the real signifi
cance of this consecutive story. It was a commercial bar
gain based upon gain. And out of this came christianity.
Feather Edge. (Pinnacle.)
In tempting Christ the devil placed him upon the pinnacle
of the temple of Jerusalem. Jerusalem means the church of
God. (Luke 4:9.) In Matt. 4:5 Christ was placed upon the
pinnacle of the mountain, meaning Christ's church, and was
tempted with wealth and empire if he could prove that he
was the son of God. Christ naturally declined with the sob
that it was too undignified, the way of escape for the church
throughout the bible. All such sob-stuff is merely to give
standing to a fake God, in the minds of ignorant credulous
people saturated with the hysteria of romantic teachings.

there was chosen by God to lead the church out of bondage.
Under the name of Jethro, posterity, Reuel suggested to
Moses to appoint the usurpative judges to enforce his own

Flower Culture. (Rakem.)
Grandson of Maachah oppression, and Machir, understand
ing, sold. His father was Peresh, dung, and his uncle was
Sheresh, root. His brother was Ulam, porch. This evidently

for the priest in a place of residence. Very likely the monas

Rakem is a descendant of Manasseh, forgetfulness.
Four. (Reba.)

this was an assault upon certain people for the spoils it would
yield is clearly stated in Num. 31. These spoils being divided
between Moses, the law, and Eleazar, the highpriest. (Num.
31 :12.) The same identical system is in vogue today. The
whole world is smothered in indulgences, penances, penalties,
Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 75
licenses and endless forms of confiscatory taxation. It is a
serious and sinister suggestion we find concealed in this
intrigue. As we have previously seen, the word city signifies
a condition, position or state in which peoples abide. We
find in Joshua 13:21 that the above destruction of kings
involved the cities in Sihon, meaning rooting out, conclusion,
and Heshbon, invention, industry, thought, he that quickly
understands. This reveals a definite assault upon established
human conditions distasteful to the church. We find this
reflected today in the antagonistic attitude of the church to
wards science and learning.

£/i=God, jah=Jehovah. God is the Lord. In the new
testament, Elias, John, Elijah is the son of a flat-nosed priest,
and a Tishbite, meaning one who makes captives. He in
vokes fire, judgments, upon the priests of Baal, master, hus
band. He himself is translated in a chariot of fire, meaning
a warfare of opinions and judgments. Reappears on the
Mount of Transfiguration, meaning made over. This merely
describes a type of Christ, as found in Luke 9 :28, for Jehovah
is God (Exodus 6:3) and God is Eli, Elijah=God is God.
Now Eli upon hearing bad news fell off his seat and broke
his neck. (I Sam. 4:18.) This proves conclusively that God
was merely the highpriest, else God was human and died by
accident, which also renders it impossible for Jesus Christ
to have been the son of God. Hence they had to admit that
he was the son of a man. He could not have been the son
of more than one man, for, to name him the figurative son
of mankind would destroy his literal existence.

was a very subtil man." (II Sam. 13:3.) He got out of Am-
non the confession that he was in love with Tamar, his own
sister, whom he later outraged, for which act his brother
Absalom murdered him. This is a vulgar mess. David
killed Uriah to prostitute his wife (II Sam. 12:9), and God
forgave him. David's son outraged his sister, and his own
brother slew him for the crime and had to flee to escape the
wrath of God expressed through his father, proving that
God could be escaped simply by flight, as Moses had escaped
by fleeing from Egypt when he committed murder. Yet we
find in Matthew 1 :1 that Jesus Christ is named the son of
David.

Grandfather of Saul. (Ner.)
Saul means the destroyer, the grave. Ner means lamp, new-
tilled land, bright. This is worth analyzing. The father of
Ner was Jehiel, treasurer. The mother was Maachah, oppres
sion, squeezing. Here is almost specific acknowledgement of
some progressive scheme connected with a new field. The
brothers of Ner, lamp, are : Abdon, service, a servant, servile,
a judge of Ephraim, doubly fruitful. Zur, stone, rock, plan,
form. A king of Midian, strife, judgment. Kish, hard,
straw, old, entangling, difficult. Father of Saul, the grave.
Baal, Lord, master, husband. God of Canaanites, merchan
dizing, trading. Nadab, liberality, voluntary, free. Control
of these forces in a new field surely was rich picking. Inas
much as Nadab is also named as a son of Aaron, enlightener,
teacher, this has to do with control of education, with the
church acting the part of Ner, lamp. Ab-ner is the father
of light and son of Ner. Ab means father. Abner in the
Hebrew is Abiner. Abi means progenitor. Therefore, the
father or priest is the progenitor and disseminator of en
lightenment.

miracle. Nisroch means proof. The eagle-headed God of
Assyria, happiness. This is a pretty story found in II Kings
19. Sennacherib, ambush of the sword, solitude, was wor
shiping in the house of his God, Nisroch, when his sons,
Adrammclech, fire-king or God, and Sharezer, master of the
treasury, smote him with the sword. This has a secret
significance of a cruel nature. Adrammelech was tortured by
fire in Samaria, the prison, with the cruel rites of Molech,
the God of fire. Undoubtedly the spirit of inquisition. The
idea of the rock, here, as the symbol of flight, is taken from
the Egyptian word Roc, meaning eagle, from which all refer
ences to Rock are taken. Peter the rock is merely Pater, the
father. St. Patrick is St. pete-rock. The murderers of
Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 99
Sennacherib escaped into Armenia, the land of Aram, mag
nificent, deceiving. This is a plain story of duplicity.

Obadiah is a figurative character for nothing is known of

Giant. (Og.)
King of Bashan, change or sleep, in the tooth. Tooth means
cruelty, sleep means death. Og was the last of the giant
Rephaim. The Rephaim Giants were healers and physicians,
especially referring to the ancient men of learning. Many of
the greatest minds the world ever knew were cruelly tortured
to death in the suppression of learning by ecclesiasts. It is
significant that Og was the King of Bash, east of Jordan,
judgment. This corroborates what we have said of the
ancient philosophers.
Great or Long O. (Omega.)
Last letter of the Greek alphabet. The great "O" is the
sun-disc, the "Pearl of Price." The Egyptian symbol of the
round sun. As christianity is disguised sun-worship it drew
many symbolisms from Egypt. "When Israel was a child,
then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt." (Hos.
11:1.) "Out of Egypt have I called my son." (Matt. 2:15.)
In an attempt to couple up the old testament with the new
testament a fatal blunder is made. If Israel is a him it
necessarily must be Jacob, who did not go up out of Egypt.
If Jacob was Israel, and Jesus is a prototype of Jacob, or
Israel, then there are centuries between the two characters
and the preaching of Jesus Christ is a fake, for modern
evangelism preaches Jesus as a literal being, actually suffering
crucifixion. To attempt to correct this error now would be
fatal to christianity, because it would reveal Jesus as merely
the Greek form of Joshua, the Hebrew savior.

at liberty, the emancipator. I Chr. 7:8, Abiah is the son of
Becher, first born, an Ephraimite, doubly fruitful. I Sam.
8:2, Abiah is the second son of Samuel, heard or asked of
God, lent to God. Abiah' s brother is Joel, willing, com
manding, swearing. This is very important. ^6=father,
iah=]ehovah, self-sustaining. /o=increase, e/=God. Abi
jah is Abijam, whose father is Jehovah, self-exalted, self-
sustaining, also father of the sea. ^4&i=progenitor. In II
Chr. 12:16, Abijah is named the son of Rehoboam, the eman
cipator. Abia analyses, ^4fo'=progenitor, with the terminat
ing a=the primal cause. Hence, this all merely has reference
to the propagation, establishing, and rendering self-sustain
ing, the ecclesiastical enterprise.
Land of Meadows. (Abilene.)

vengeance. Lord means chief, master, loaf-warden.
Lord is Jehovah. (Adonijah.)
My master is the Lord. Fourth son of David, amatory love,
by Haggith, rejoicing, joy, a dancer. This is a pretty raw
confession, for Jehovah is acknowledged today as the chris
tian God. But the more remarkable statement is that, this
Adoni-jah or Jehovah, was put to death by Solomon, recom
pense, pay, reward. This gives another clew as to the future
plans of the plotters. Solomon typifies wisdom ; Jehovah is
God, and God is Jesus Christ who was put to death as a
pathetic part of a great passion play to tear the heart out
of ignorant, innocent, gaping humanity. All a palpable, sim
ple-minded fake, secretly picturing a struggle between arbi
trary ignorance and monopolized wisdom to rule the world.
128 Ecclesiastical Vocabulary
Lord. (Adonai.)
The Hebrews did not use the word Jehovah, but Adonai.
Jehovah was unknown to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. (Ex.
6:3.) That was due to the fact that the church was not
established, and was not self-sustaining. The bargain with
the Jews, called a covenant, was that they stiould take over
Canaan, merchandizing and trading, and help maintain and
support the church as a political institution. For the character
of the bargain read Genesis 28, especially verse 22, which
specifically names the amount the church shall receive from
Jacob, the usurper, who becomes Israel, the church of Christ.
Lord is Raised (the). (Adonikam.)
My Lord hath raised.
Lord of Heights. (Adoniram.)
The Lord of might and elevation. Chief receiver of tribute
under David, love, Solomon, wisdom, and Rehoboam, eman
cipation. This clearly defines the condition arising from the
bargain with the Jews. In II Chron. 10:18 the name is Ha-
doram, meaning power. He is called the son of Joktan, dis
gust, weariness, dispute. This distinctly develops out of
taxation, and accounts for the change in the name. Reho
boam sent Hadoram to collect tribute from Israel, the church
of Christ, and they stoned him to death. Rehoboam got him
to his Chariot and fled to Jerusalem. This is a good one.
The people rebelled against taxation, and the king pulled that
abomniable precedent for modern times, the formula, "war
to insure peace." Chariot means warfare. Jerusalem means
recompense, peace. Peace is usually purchased by confis
catory indemnity, the fruit of every war. Jerusalem is the
church of God.
Lord of Justice. (Adoni-zedec.)
Lord of equity, justice of the Lord. The king of the Amor-
ites, bitter, rebellious, babblers, of Jerusalem, who formed a
league against Joshua, increased wealth. To this day, the
doctrine of poverty, brought upon the people by taxation, as
a ruling or controlling power over the masses has been main
tained.
Laudable. (Aeneas.)
Praised, approved. The paralytic at Lydda, begetting, at
birth, strife, healed by Peter, typing obedience. The Hebrew
Lud or Lod, strife, maturity. Acts 10:33-34 plainly reveals
the trickery of secret suggestion in dealing with the rebellious
people.

1-2.) Jebus means trading, contempt, treading under foot,
contemns. Salem means peaceful, reward. Jebus was the
original name of Jerusalem, threshing floor. Salem also is
supposed to be Jerusalem. Hence they are all merely figura
tive names.

Lord (daughter of the). (Bithiah.)
Daughter of a Pharaoh. Here is conclusive evidence that
the Lord God is none other than the ruling power in authority
over the people. This explanation is found in I Chr. 4.
Ezra means the help or court of God. He begets Mered,
rebellion, who takes for wife Bithiah, the daughter of the
Lord, Pharaoh, the sun-king of Egypt, oppression and trou
ble. The brother of Mered is Heber, alliance, from whence
came the Hebrews. Heber begets Socho or Succoth, meaning
tents and tabernacles. Succoth was the first stopping place
of the Israelites coming out of Egypt, oppression and trouble,
simply picturing nomadic tribes breaking away from nations
and seeking liberty where there was no governing power other
than their own chiefs. The alliance is between the Ecclesiasts
and the Jews, the latter to usurp Canaan, merchandizing and
trading, and the former to control the religious and political
government as a dual temporal power. Ecclesiasitcism means
government. It is derived from the Greek Ecclesia, the legis
lative body which ruled ancient Athens. This alleged Hebrew
history is pure bunk, used as a precedent in the exploitation
of an equally fictitious beginning of the christian exploita
tion. The Hebrew savior, Joshua, is brought over in its
Greek form, Jesus, to become the fabulous Christ. The
alleged Jesus is born of Mary, rebellion, the same meaning
we found attached to Mered. This Jesus is carried down
into Egypt, oppression and trouble, by his mother, rebellion,
and his adopted father, Joseph, meaning increase. Later
Jesus and his followers take refuge in Galilee, meaning revo
lution. It was a well planned conspiracy to surreptitiously
seize control of established governing institutions to give to
the head of a fake religion supreme temporal power. The
success of the scheme was phenominal; for nearly five hun
dred years the popes of Rome held the temporal power over
Europe, during which period tens of millions of human lives
were sacrificed by this horrible, usurpative power in its ruth
less determination to permanently establish itself on its sav
ing rock, Joshua. /o=increase, Shua=wealth. Increased
wealth is the savior of christianity.

The Greek form of Edom is Idumea, red. Edom also is

lightenment in the schools, the death of Aaron symbolizing
the suppression of the previous scientific learning. The
"dark ages." 486 to 1495 corroborates this. Isaiah 34 gives

nations. Every preacher who stands in his pulpit and draws
attention to this chapter should be prosecuted.

Abraham's name for the spot where he offered Isaac for
sacrifice. (Gen. 22:14.) Yet in Ex. 6
:3,
we are told, Abra
ham had never heard of Jehovah. The offering of Isaac
is
merely
a
fake story, but
it
conceals a sinister suggestion.
Isaac means joy and prosperity. The idea of God providing
a
way out of sacrificing joy and prosperity, refers to the
false-pretense of the crucifixion of God's only son Jesus,
meaning the sacrifice of increased wealth, the surplus.
It
is
said that Isaac was Abraham's "only begotten son," yet
a
long line of sons are accredited to him. It
is
these glaring
contradictions which make these stories ridiculous.

Tubal-cain, Cain shall be brought back, worldly possession.
Tubal= tumult, Cai'w=possession. Mother of Rehoboam,
. emancipator. This is a story. In Gen. 4, the confession that
Adam is the father of Cain, and Eve names him the Lord,
makes him the original God of the Jews. The name Baal
means Lord and husband. There is no distinction made
between this Lord, and the Lord God, and the Almighty God
of Abram mentioned in Gen. 17:1. Cain, upon being driven
out of Eden was not accused of disobedience, but of Sin,
meaning ambush, enmity. Sin, Sinai, Senah, are all one,
bush and bramble, primarily symbolizing the distribution of
the wild vegetation. Cain is a symbol of the fugitive, uncul
tivated vegetation. Eden means a garden, a place of cultiva
tion, the delight and pleasure of learning. In the significance
of Tubal-Cain, the wild, untamed weeds, bushes and brambles
are to be "brought back," that
is,
symbolizing the common
masses of humanity, the fugitive races are to be brought
under discipline. As the wife of Solomon, Naamah
is
asso
ciated with wisdom and discretion, in again taking "posses
sion" of the untutored people, in
a
state of chaos and tumult.
As the sister of Tubal-Cain, she, by her "pleasantry," quiets
the tumult and confusion and gains "possession" of the land
and control of the people. As the wife of Rehoboam she
becomes the "emancipator" of the ignorant, untutored masses.
This reveals, beyond dispute, the original intent to cast the
masses down into ignorance and stupidity, and then attempt
162 Ecclesiastical Vocabulary
to raise them up under church discipline and censorship under
the false-pretense of emancipation. Rehoboam also means
enlarger of the people, who sets the people at liberty—from
what? The church has always posed as the champion of the
masses as against their own established civil government.
Pleasantness. (Naaman.)
This is merely the origin of "cleanliness is Godliness," and
to teach that judgment is better than haste. (Read II Kings
5.) This is all teaching the efficacy of making oneself pleas
ing in persuasive argument and especially applies to the work
of priests.

Solomon is the son of David by Bathsheba, daughter of the

tute his wife. This is another evidence that humanity was
debased and deprived of intellect.
Porch-scholars. (Stoics.)
Members of a Grecian philosophical school, holding to a high
morality, proud independence of spirit, fateful instead of
providential superintendence, with wisdom as the source of
happiness. The school was founded by Zeno, 308 B. C. All
schools of the philosophy hated by the christians. (Col.
2:8.)
Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 165
Pass to Shiloh. (Taanath-Shiloh.)
A border of Ephraim, doubly fruitful. One significance of
Shiloh is abundance. Taanah means one who humbles or
afflicts. Which seems to be a coercive way of bringing peace
on a par with "war to assure peace." In simpler words,
kill them off so they cannot fight.
Palms. (Tadmor.)
Change, palm-tree. The Palmyra of Greeks and Romans.
Palm means victory, hence peace is a product of warfare.
The temple of the Sun, dedicated to Baal, is located there.
Palm-tree. (Tamar.)
Widow of Er, watch, enemy, and Onan, pain, force, iniquity.
Here is one of the vulgar stories of the bible which always
involve the important characters. Tamar was the daughter
of David, amorous love, and the sister of Absalom and
Amnon. The latter outraged their sister, Tamar, and Ab
salom killed him. Tamar played the street harlot and en
ticed her blind father-in-law, Judah, and bare him twins.
Pharez, breach, rupture, breaking forth violently, division,
and Zarah, east, brightness, rising—reference to the resur
rection of the sun. Why should they clothe their code in
such vulgar stories, none of these characters ever lived. Al
though a bastard son of intrigue, Pharez becomes one in the
genealogy of Christ.
Prince of Darkness. (Tartak.)
Chained up, bound, shut up. Allegedly an idol worshipped
in Samaria, prison, symbolizing darkness. In the christian
scheme the name is Satan, nevertheless he is identical with
Tartak. The idea is drawn from the mythological Tartarus,
an abyss under the earth where the Titans were confined, the
christians adding to this, and where the wicked were confined.
Satan means wicked adversary. Tartan means to search, law,
instruction.
Purged. (Tebaliah.)
Third son of Hosah, refuge. Tebah means murder, slaugh
ter, a son of Nahor, storm, anger, wrath. There were six
cities of refuge established to which murderous priests could
flee and escape the wrath and anger of the people. There
they were purged of their crimes. The idea was taken from
the refuge city built upon Mount Palastine about 753 B. C.
as a rendezvous of all the criminals of Europe. Out of this
developed the Monastic system, and within Monastery walls
166 Ecclesiastical Vocabulary
was incubated the ecclesiastical enterprise for exploiting the
world and subjugating humanity under the guise of religion.
Prominent. (Thebez.)
Muddy, eggs, silk, fine linen. Near Shechem, portion, servi
tude. Scene of the tragic death of Abimelech, my father is
king. Abimelech was son of Gideon, bruiser, breaker, who
cuts off iniquity, by his concubine, Shechem.
Portion (fruitful). (Timnath-serah.)
Timnath=image, enumeration, figure, reckoning. Serah=
lady of scent, morning star, song. A city of Ephraim, doubly
fruitful, given to Joshua, increased wealth, his home and
burial place. Also Timnath-heres. Heres means the sun.
The sun was worshipped as the morning star. Hera is the
Greek name of Juno. The word Serah is adopted to disguise
a plagiarism. In Judges 1 :34-35 is an excellent example of
concealment of intrigue. "The Amorites forced the Danites
into the mountain; for they would not suffer them to come
down into the valley." "But the Amorites would dwell in
Mount Heres." Mountain means the church. Mount or Hill
means school. Valley means production or the people. Am
orites mean bitter, rebellious, babblers. Dan means judg
ment, opinion. Heres means sun, sun-worship.
Pleasing. (Tirzah.)
Well-pleasing, benevolent, pleasant. Youngest of the five
daughters of Zelaphehad, the shadow of fear. Here is an
other pretty story. Zelophehad was the son of Hepher, a
digger, a delver, pit, a pitfall. The five daughters mentioned
are :
Mahlah, melodious song, infirmity, sickness.
Noah, rest, repose, consolation, comfort.
Hoglah, festival, dance.
Milcah, queen.
Tirzah, pleasing, benevolent.
That is one side of the story. Tirzah is also a city between
Jerusalem, the church of God, and Samaria, the prison. It
was a city of Canaan, merchandizing and trading, and was
captured by Joshua, increased wealth. Let some wise man of
the church attempt to refute or explain this interpretation
and the digger and delver may prove to be a grave-digger.
Place of Burning. (Tophet.)
Drum, betrayal, noise, place of burning. Part of the valley
of Hinnom, wailing, their shrieking. Here they sacrificed
children to the fire-god Molech, burning them alive. Drums
Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 167
were beaten constantly to drown the shrieks of the tortured
children and the wails of the mothers. (Read II Kings 23,
Jer. 7, Isa. 30:33.) Out of Judah came the christian church,
which made Hinnom and Tophet look like a penny with a
hole in it when it perpetrated its damnable crusades of mur
der, rape and arson, and its nameless inquisition.
Passing Over. (Trespass.)
To violate a law of god.
Power. (Ucal.)
Prevalent power. The prophecy of Agur, the gatherer of
wisdom, was addressed to Ucal, the prevalent or established
power, and Ithiel, God comes, sign. Agur was the son of
Jakeh, pious. Pious means religious. Religious means an
oath bound monk.
Pure Water. (Ulai.)
Strength. A river in the province of Elam. Elam was a
son of Shem, name, fame. Elam means a young priest, a
virgin, a secret, an age. Here we have in code the story
of the doctrine of the immaculate conception, which was not
mentioned until a hundred years after Christ, and was not
fully confirmed until the 19th century.
Porch. (Ulam.)
Their folly, the porch, their strength. A descendant of Man-
asseh, forgetfulness. Ulam's father was Shereth, the root,
and his brother was Rakem, flower culture. This we believe
to be a sarcastic reference to the Stoics called the porch
philosophers. They were studious and given to meditation
while gardening. They were fatalists, not believing in a
providential superintendence. Wisdom was the source of all
happiness, and the nearest approach to divine guidance and
protection. The christian pretense is a divine supervision
over men through paid vicars on earth, a parasitical priest
hood.
Praise of God. (Vaniah.)
A son of Bani, builder.
Pledges. (Wages.)
Place of Wild Beasts. (Wilderness.)
The wilderness of the Israelite wandering was Sinai, sin,
ambush, enmity. Between Seir, the cave-dwellers, monas
tics, Edom, the earthy producing masses, and Akaba, to
supplant, usurpation by trickery. ^fefew&=insidious.

Adam=warm sun. There is an allegory that mankind are the
children of Adam, the warm sun, and Eve, the everlasting
Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 169
life or breath. Adam and Eve are the generic symbol of
humanity. There is no mention in Genesis of Adam having
awakened from the deep sleep into which he was thrown to
produce Eve. The name Adam is derived from the San
skrit Adim, meaning first. The name is used generically for
man and woman, and is translated man in Gen. 1 :26.

noisy, rejoicing. Aroer, a city of Reuben, vision prophecy.
Later to Moab, of the father. A town of Gad, armed and
prepared. A town of Judah, approval. In Isa. 17:2, an
unidentified place. This is typical biblical confusion and
contradiction when taken literally.
Reproof. (Ashbel.)
Second son of Benjamin, protection.
Reconciliation. (Atonement.)
At-one-ment. This is one of the greatest absurdities in the
christian theme. An all powerful God permits his own crea
tions to drop into a depraved sinful state in order that he
may exploit his own powers of mercy by an alleged expiation
of that sin by torturing and murdering his own alleged son.
It is beyond belief that humanity would be thus humbugged.

usually imply revolution. See Gilgal, revolution, wheel.
Birthplace of Paul, the church worker. In Hebrew Paul is
Saul, destroyer, the grave.
Renowned Father. (Cleopas.)
Learned, chief priest, the whole glory. One of the two dis
ciples to whom Christ appeared. This bunk may be found
in Luke 24. In John 19:25-26 we find an extension of the
idea of glory attaching to all who helped to fix up this simple
minded fake. Mary means rebellion. There were at the
cross of Jesus, three Marys, Mary the mother of Jesus, Mary
the wife of Cleophas, renowned, and Mary Magdalene ; i.e.,
of Magdala, greatness. Magdalene means tower, grand, ele
vated. Each of these characters being promoted by the name
Mary, rebellion, mother of Jesus, the Greek form of
Joshua, meaning increased wealth. Jesus names Mary, his
own mother, also mother of Cleophas, making rebellion the
mother of renown and glory. If this is not promoting revo
lution, what is it ? While creating a picture to tear the heart
out of credulous humanity, they were secretly fostering con
ditions to lead to warfare. This reveals the meanest betrayal
and greatest tragedy in human history. Jesus became the sym
bol of humanity sacrificed to ambition for glory. That was the
crucifixion then, and has continued to be to this day. Rebel
lion, revolution and war never cease. There has not been
one hour of peace on earth since the introduction of this
murderous system. "Prince of Peace." Bah! "Think not
Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 171
that I am come to send peace on earth; I came not to send
peace but a sword." (Matt. 10:34.)
Raised of God. (Eli-akim.)
My God revenges, God the avenger. Resurrection of God.
This fully coincides with the previous story. God allegedly
crucifies or sacrifices his own son of his own free will, then
raises him up in the raiment of an avenging God. This ven
geance is taken upon suffering humanity which gets it com
ing and going.
Restored of God. (Eliashib.)
My God will bring back, God of conversion.
Rejected of God. (Elika.)
Pelican of God. The pelican is the symbol of desolation.
Rock (God his). (Elisur.)
My God is a rock. Rock means strength, refuge. A prince
of Reuben, vision, prophecy. This should reflect no credit
to him, for Reuben lost his birthright through crime. (Gen.
35:22.)
Recompense of God. ( Gamaliel.)
Weaned of God. Prince of Manasseh, forgetfulness. Learned
president of the Sanhedrim, meaning the supreme council of
the Jews. Paul's legal adviser. Here is a clear case of the
church leaving the professional classes alone as long as they
worked together.
Rolling. (Gilgal.)
Wheel, revolution. We have here the first evidence of the
purpose of the alleged journey in the wilderness to terminate
in revolution. Gilgal, revolution, is the first stopping place
of the Israelites west of Jordan. (Josh. 4:19.) Israel means
the church of Christ. Christ is called Israel. Jordan means
judgment, opinion.

giving people, the burden of the people.
Regarded. (Hashabiah.)

Rest. (Hen.)
Grace, quiet. Son of Zephaniah, the secret of the Lord. The

in the bible, Matt. 23:37 and Luke 13:34.
Ruler (army). (Herald.)

preached. Simon of Cyrene was compelled to carry it to
Golgotha, the place of the skull. (Matt. 27:32.) Hence,
obedience made humanity a victim. Peter, the rock, was
named Simon, obedience, and was the foundation of church
discipline. Golgotha is merely the Hebrew name for Calvary,
the Latin for the Greek word Kranion, meaning the skull.
There is a deeper physiological and psychological significance
concealed in the alleged crucifixion, which belongs to science
and not to religion. The base of the brain within the skull
is the seat of control of the circulation of the red-blood,
Rufus.
Rest. (Sabbath.)
An arbitrary day of rest, having no religious import what
ever. The Jewish sabbath and the christian sabbath do not
fall on the same day. Moreover, the sabbath was allegedly
invented by the Jews as a day of recreation and festivities,
whereas, the christian forbids this. The christian idea that
its sabbath commemorates the resurrection of Christ is pure
bunk and false-pretense.
Rod. (Sebat.)
Scepter, tribe.
Rock. (Selah.)
The Greek city Petra.
Royal. (Shadrach.)
Tender nipple, tender field. Quite a significant suggestion
that to attempt to exact pap from the royalty is a delicate
matter. This is emphasized by the fact that this name was
given to Hananiah, meaning that everything the church could
extract from any source was a gift from the Lord.
Repays (God. (Shelemiah.)

one of the secret suggestions of war to emphasize the value
Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 177

Revenge. (Shallum.)
Peaceable, perfect, rewarder. Murdered Zachariah, remem
bered by Jehovah, and usurped his throne. Jehovah means

pator. Shallum, revenge, was himself slain, and Menahem,
the comforter, succeeded him.
Retribution. (Shillem.)
Son of Naphtali, wrestling, fighting.
Rivers (two). (Shinar.)
Watching of him that sleeps, change of the city, shaking out.
City means attitude, condition. "Two rivers" mean the
Tigris, war, and Euphrates, fructifying. Shinar was the
seat of the kingdom of Nimrod, rebellion, who built Babel,
mixture and confusion. Asshur went out of Shinar and
founded Nineveh, a pleasing dwelling place. The confusion
of tongues occurred in Babel. This will all become more in
teresting when read with the succeeding names.

blood. Jordan means judgment. Naaman means pleasant
ness, agreeable, preparation for action. Naaman was a Syrian
whose deceit compared him with a leper. Elisha, salvation of

helpless, an abbreviation of Eleazar, meaning the help or court
of God. Eleazar was the third son of Aaron, hence he could
not have been a brother to Mary and Martha. This reveals
an intrigue. Aaron means enlightenment. He had four
sons. Nadab, liberality, free and voluntary gifts. Abihu,
God is the father—recognition of the highpriest as God.
Eleazar, help or court of God, disguised as Lazarus, help
less. Ithamar, palm, victory. Nadab and Abihu were des
troyed by fire because they taught freedom of religion and en
lightenment. Fire means judgment, opinion. Eleazar as
Lazarus is helpless to do other than he is commanded, he is
192 Ecclesiastical Vocabulary
the court arbitrarily ruled by the law. Aaron, enlightenment,
was taken into the mountain, Christ's church, and murdered,
and Eleazar, the court, was clothed in his garments, taking
Aaron's place as highpriest. Liberal education was suppress

Shoving. (Hatred.)
Mother of Mehetabel, God-favored, wife of Hadar or Hadad,

Strife. (Midian, Medan.)
Measure, process, judgment. This is a legal system. Moses,
the law, committed murder and fled to Midian, strife, and
married the daughter of Raguel, or Reuel, the prince and
highpriest. The father-in-law later advised Moses to appoint
the "usurpative judges." We find a sinister aspect in every
principal biblical character. Midian is the son of Abraham,
God's own chosen partner. If Abraham is the progenitor
of strife, how can God escape responsibility for all the sub
sequent evils? God himself declares he is the God of Abra
ham, Isaac and Jacob, all of whom were liars, swindlers,
murderers and drunkards.
Smitten. (Mehujael.)
Who proclaims God, blotted out and smitten of God. Son
of Irad, wild ass, heap of descents, of empire. This was of
the line of Cain, possession, and preceded Noah; hence, it is
a suggestion of both, the destruction by the deluge and the
conquest to destroy civil government and seize temporal
poiver by the church. The deluge figuratively presaged a
multitude of afflictions and ordinances, which is the meaning
of waters.
Saved. (Melatiah.)
A Gibeonite, a lofty hill. Hill means school.
Strife. (Meribah.)
Dispute, quarrel. (Exodus 17.)

Separated. (Nazarite.)
One bound by a vow. A vow means a wish. There are
three forms of ecclesiastical vows, none of which have any
other religious significance than given to them by the wish
or command of the church. Vow of devotion, see Jacob's
vow. Gen. 28. Vow of abstinence, see monastic vows. Vow
of destruction, see vows of vengeance. All wholly devoted
to the welfare of the church. Little thought for the welfare
of the people is involved.

Speaking Beforehand. (Prophet.)
Prophecy is alleged to be under God's inspiration. The pro
phetic order was political as well as spiritual. There are 16
books of the prophets, four greater and thirteen lesser. The
Greater Prophets —Passive:
Isaiah, salvation of the Lord.

The Lesser Prophets —Active:
Hosea, help of the Lord.
Joel, will of the Lord.

Nahum, he that comforts.
Habakkuk, he that persuades.
Zaphaniah, he that discovers secrets.
Haggi, he who impresses.
Zechariah, he who remembers.
Malachi, God's messenger.
This is merely the working outfit of the highpriest, with not
the slightest pretense of divine or supernatural inspiration or
origin. The alleged fulfillment of prophecy by divine inter
vention is pure false-pretense. Enforced fulfillment was by
political intrigue and falsehood.
Servant of the People. (Publican.)
Gatherers of taxes, hated by the Jews as much as they are
now abhorred by all mankind. The original name of Matthew
was Levi, the tax-gatherer, who collected the taxes at Caper
naum, meaning place of repentance. The softer word, gift,
is applied to Matthew, God's gift. Taxation today as nearly
Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 195
approaches criminal confiscation as the laws will permit. It
is the one undisputed evidence that the masses of people are
helpless under a tyranical legislative power wholly independ
ent of the public will—an invisible super-government.

a liar, a polygamist. He defrauded his brother through the
connivance of his mother, swindled his father-in-law ; and,
like his grandfather, Abraham, he was criminally intimate
with the female servants of his own household. Nevertheless,
God made a special bargain with him (Gen. 28) and he be
came Israel, a type of the church of Christ. He named the
church Bethel, the house of God. If Jacob were eliminated
from the christian theme, there could be no christian church
nor priesthood.

means princess of the multitude. Wife of Abraham, father
of a multitude. He tried to murder his son, denied his wife,
debauched his hired-girl, and turned her and his bastard
child out in the wilderness to starve. Is anyone fanatical
enough to declare God responsible for these acts?

der mercy of God.

Suffering. (Passion.)
Suffering of Christ. If Christ had been a living man he
would have deserved no especial praise or credit for his
suffering, for it was unsolicited, and not understood by man
kind, and of his own volition. Moreover, it utterly failed
198 Ecclesiastical Vocabulary
of its purpose. But Christ is merely a modifying word
derived from the Greek Kristos, the Hebrew form of which
is the word Messiah, meaning to smear with grease. Moses
was even ordered to annoint, or grease even the furniture,
pots and pans of the tabernacle. The alleged suffering of the
fabulous Jesus Christ upon a cross is merely figurative, and
when preached literally, it is the meanest false-pretense in
the bible. Priests and preachers know this.
Shepherd. (Pastor.)
A pleasing word adopted by preachers to win the sympathy
and goodwill of simple, credulous people. The word is de
rived from the same root as pasture, and signifies feeding,
food, pabulum. "An honest confession is good for the soul."
"If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great
thing if we shall reap your carnal things." (I Cor. 9:11.)
If anyone can interpret this into a living food or pabulum
we should like to examine it. This is an average christian
make-believe, childish and undignified.
Southern. (Pathros.)
Mouthful of dnv, meaning conversions.
Saul. (Paul.)
Paul means the church worker. Saul means destroyer, the
grave. Saul is the Hebrew form of Paul. Paul is a clean-
cut make-believe, no such person ever lived. Births, mar
riages and deaths are the three great sources of income to the
church. Abolish the cradle, the marriage bed and the grave
and the preachers would have to go to work.

The two books, two scribes. Place in Syria where colonists
were sent to Samaria. Syria, deceiving, Samaria, prison.
Seventy. (Septuagint.)
Now we have a story. The fabulous story is related that the
Hebrew scriptures were translated into Greek by 70 or 72
Jews, employed by Ptolemy Philadelphus about B. C. 270,
for which the fabulous sum of $7,250,000 was allegedly paid.
They were paired and locked in cells until the work was com
pleted. It is strange that this should directly follow Sephar-
vaim. The Latin version was made from the Greek. Flavins
Josephus, a fake Jew historian, intimates that one Machir
sold the Jewish history to the ecclesiasts. Machir means one
who knows and sells. He is the eldest son of Manasseh, for-
getfulness. He is also named the son of Ammiel, the people
of God, the spy of Dan, judgment. He is also called Eliam,
God's people. This is a part of the bunk surrounding the
origin of the old testament, when it is well authenticated it
was written centuries later.

of the Lord God to be found in the bible. God confesses that
he had two daughters who were guilty of whoredoms in their
youth and while they were virgins, and they bare bastard
sons. He boasts of their being his. It is all the more vulgar
that this is allegedly a figurative story. God admits the guilt
of a man to conceal the alleged guilt of a community, the
morality of which he claims to control.

SHOCKING THINGS IN THE BIBLE
We must now call especial attention to the amazing evidences
of duplicity concealed in this elaborate code. There are about
two thousand separate items in the list. Only about two hun
dred and twenty-five of these items are free from the suggestion
of crime, evil, duplicity, deceit, or other forms of dereliction.
No decent, self-respecting person can believe in a God so en
tangled in all that is vile and corrupt. Every crime in the
calendar is found associated with these Biblical names, words
and places, and the christian church and its God are directly
interested in warfare, rebellion, revolution, murder, plunder,
rapine, incest, adultery, vengeance, and every known form of
evil, through the leading Biblical characters. Adam, the image
of God, was a cringing coward. Noah was a drunkard, cursing
his own son for discovering him in a disgraceful state. Yet
224 Ecclesiastical Vocabulary
God declared him perfect above all other men. Abraham,
"the father of us all," was willing to murder his own son,
denied his own wife, was a liar, debauched his own female
servant who bare him a bastard son, then turned her and the
child out to starve, allegedly at the command of God. Yet God
entered into a special bargain with him. Lot, a drunkard, was
guilty of incest with his two daughters, who bare him bastard
children. Yet God took especial pains to protect him.
Jacob defrauded his brother with the connivance of his
mother, swindled his father-in-law, was criminally intimate with
his female servants and was a usurper. Yet he became Israel,
which symbolizes the church of Christ, and was especially
favored by God.
Moses, "looked this way and that way" and committed a cold
blooded murder, concealing his victim in the sand. He was an
ordinary confidence man, guilty of every trick of confiscation
of other people's property. He originated the infamous law
against witches, ordered the theft of jewels and clothing from
the Egyptians, and the slaughter of innocent women and chil
dren, but saved all the young girls for immoral purposes. Yet
he symbolized the laws of God.
Joshua, a cold-blooded butcher, thief and robber. The name
Jesus is the Greek form of Joshua. Joshua was named the
savior of Israel.
David, "a man after God's own heart." God caused to be
committed about every known crime under the law to enable
David to supplant Saul as King. David was a liar, a robber,
a murderer, a stealer of other men's wives, a mean, grasping
tax gatherer without law, an adulterer, guilty of incest and
about every other form of crime he could crowd into his life.
He murdered Uriah in order to prostitute his wife, who became
the mother of a bastard child which God ordered killed to pre
vent disgrace to the church. Yet David was forgiven. David
had seen Bathsheba washing her person and became enamoured
of her. Later she became the mother of Solomon by David.
Nevertheless, in Matthew 1:1, this vile reprobate is named the
"father of Jesus Christ."
Solomon, his chief wisdom consisted of hunting spoils, wives
and concubines, and singing vulgar songs about them. He was
notoriously licentious, and was an acknowledged idolatrous
tyrant, making human sacrifices to Molech, the God of fire.
Elisha, so sensitive about his personal appearance that he
caused forty-two innocent children to be mangled because they
Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 225
made remarks about his bald head. Yet his name signifies the
"salvation of God."
Now, you simple-minded dummies, who blindly -believe in
christianity, and protest that "every word in the bible is true,"
digest this and then test your faith.
But, wait a moment. In the hidden scriptures Jesus Christ
himself is accused of murdering at least two persons, one an
innocent boy, and the other his teacher.
Today he would be called a bootlegger in the United States,
because of his ability to make good wine. It may be said there
was no law against it then. This only proves that crime has
been legislated into mankind.
This is worth the careful thought of every so-called christian.
The clergy and the Jews alone are exempted under the Volstead
act.
SUMMARY
In a comprehensive summing up of the truths revealed by
this arrangement of Biblical words and names, conclusive evi
dences of fraud and false-pretense are glaringly apparent
throughout the Bible.
There is absolutely nothing to prove that a God of the char
acter portrayed in the Bible ever had existance. Not one single
benefit has been rendered to humanity by this God of the Jews.
On the contrary, he is eternally grafting upon mankind in some
form, all the proceeds of his ravenous and endless forms of
coerced taxation being paid to, and appropriated to the uses
of the priesthood. Not one cent or carnal thing can be traced
nearer to God than the hand of the grasping priest and the
church treasury. This, however, is the mildest part of the in
dictment. Every leading character in the Bible, including God
himself, is openly convicted of, and frankly confesses his guilt,
of every crime known to modern civilization. Not one of these
characters could live outside a prison today. Murder, drunken
ness, highway robbery, theft, deceit, trickery, falsehood and
false-pretense are considered kingly virtues. All of them were
libertines of the vilest types, being guilty of confessed adul
tery, incest and outrage upon helpless women and children.
Hatred, savage vengeance and eternal conflict are ever grinding
in the hearts of the Godly forces. Temptations are deliberately
226 Ecclesiastical Vocabulary
dangled before the eyes of humanity, enhanced by Godly ex
ample, to lead mankind into sin and vicious crime.
Crime, insanity, poverty and gross ignorance, have been
legislated into the masses in order to convert these abnormal
things into commercial assets.
All of this has been made possible by the rule of fear—super
stitious fear of invisible and unknowable terrors controlled by
the church; fear of savage, uncompromising laws, and fear of
the men who control the established system of coercion, having
the power to enforce upon the ignorant, credulous masses the
imbecilic doctrine that authority born of armed force is the
visible evidence of a fabulous, unnatural, invisible God.
Not one individual named as an active participant in the
Biblical scheme ever existed. It is all born of the drunken
imagination of the most fiendish brutes that ever betrayed
mankind for selfish ends. The earth has been fertilized with
the blood of untold million's of innocent beings in the promotion
and perpetuation of the meanest imposition ever forced upon
the peoples of the earth.
Christianity has always been "armed and prepared" for mas
sacre and bloody warfare. There has not been a moment free
from wars, rebellions, seditions, revolutions and inquisitional
murders, since the introduction of the christian exploitation.
Man has been taught to hate and hunt his own kind.
Christ is born of Mary, rebellion, and resided in Galilee, re
volution. Words are placed in the mouth of this fabulous
being, brazenly declaring:
"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth; I come
not to send peace, but a sword.
"For I am come to set a man at variance against his father,
and the daughter, against her father." (Matt. 10:34-35.)
This Jewish God called Jesus, the Greek form of Joshua, is
named the "prince of peace." Yet he confesses he comes to
violate the most sacred human ties.
What kind of a fool proposition is this which has so hypno
tized the world that it dare not resent such brazen false-pre
tense ? Are all the people gone crazy ? No ! not all ; those who
are benefitting by this game are very sane.
Why extend this? Fear has mankind by the throat; man
hood has been shaken out of humanity; the yoke is adjusted
and all hell cannot release the struggling, slaving masses. The
system has fastened its teeth in our forms of government.
Neither peace, morality nor sanity will prevail upon earth
until this hateful monstrosity is suppressed. The suggestive,
Ecclesiastical Vocabulary 227
vicious, vulgar Bible must go. Every crime known to civilized
mankind has its precedent in the Christian Bible, and modern
laws have been adjusted to them to ensnare mankind and render
them innocuous.
Let those who dispute what we write study the Bible in con
junction with this vocabulary, and there will be no argument.
Curse! you wise men. Weep! you fools.
This is your only consolation.
You have been sorely betrayed.
Keep this constantly in your mind. This Christ scheme
conceals a tremendous intrigue against the peace and stability of
the world.
The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is symbolic of the crushing
of humanity as the "King of Kings" down into abject ignorance
and misery. The darkness which covered the world at the
time of this crucifixion was the darkness of ignorance. The
earthquake which rent the temple was revolutions, social up
heavals and destructive wars. The plea for the return of the
light was a cry for a return to education and intellectual train
ing of the new generation. The resurrection typifies the rising
of the trained christian favorites out of abject ignorance, which
failed to materialize.
Jesus is the offspring of Mary, rebellion. Joseph is the in
creasing people. They take refuge in Galilee, revolution, and
Capernaum, repentance.
There has not been one day of peace since the introduction
of this Christ idea. The cry for faith in redemption from a
state of terrorism and darkness is urged as strongly today as
when the system was introduced two thousand years ago. The
world is submerged in all that makes life a curse.
This is enough !
