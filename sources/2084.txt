MY DEAR SIR,
The high position which you have so long and so
deservedly occupied in the estimation of the profession in
general, and of all who have the advantage of knowing you,
'vould have prompted me to inscribe to you this work, were
I not induced so to do, by the grateful remembrance of your
unvaried kindness, as also of the advantages I derived from
your instruction during my studies; and although I could
'vish the work to have been more 'vorthy of being dedicated
to you, I am yet happy to avail myself of this opportunity in
offering a slight tribute of respect and esteem.
Believe me to remain,
My dear Sir,
Your obliged and faithful Servant,
THE AUTHOR.
PREFACE.
THE present volume is intended to give the professional
public a concise account of some of the principal Medical
Institutions on the continent, deduced from personal obser-
vation at various periods within the last seven years, and
will, I trust, be considered by those best qualified to judge,
a3 presentin"g an impartial and not inaccurate sketch of the
actual state of medical and surgical practice in France and
Italy. Smne cases, taken for the most part by myself, have
been inserted to illustrate the method of treatment usually
adopted, but much has been omitted, which from having •
been already published in the English language, '''ould have
increased the size of the book without making a proportion- -
ate addition to its usefulness. For the same reason, no
n1ention is made of the French provincial hospitals in which
the practice does not materially differ from that pursued in
Paris, and of which, having only visited some of them en
passant, I could have recorded but mere statistical details of
little interest.
J?uring my visit to Italy last year, I found the state of
medicine had undergone very little change since I published
tny Observations on Italian Medical Institutions, four years
ago ; the parts relating to Florence and NapleB are conse-
quently reprinted almost ·without alteration. The notes on
Gern1an institutions were taken during a tour this summer,
and though less copious than those on the Parisian and
8 PREFACE.
Italian institutions, may serve to convey some idea of the
state of practice in that country.
Animal magnetism and hommopathy being of foreign ori-
gin, though not strictly connected 'vith medicine, and the
latter especially having recently attracted the notice of many
persons, I have thought it not misplaced to give a bri~f ac-
count of them in an Appendix, which may tend to place the
pre~nsions of their supporters in a proper light with the
public.
I take the opportunity of expressing my grateful acknow·-
ledgment of the .attentions and urbanity I experienced from
the professors and medical attendants of the different i~sti­
tutions which I have visited; and beg to assure future tra-
vellers that on the continent generally, strangers meet with
no impediment to their visiting.charitable establishments, but
on the contrary, every facility of investigation is afforded
them.

OBSERVATIONS,
PART I.
FRENCH l\1ED ICAL INSTITUTIONS.
THE establi:o:hments for the relief of the sick and infirm poor are by
fa r on a more extensive scale in Paris than in any other metropolis.
Upwards of fifteen thousand beds are occupied in the various hospices
and ho:spitals; forty-seven thousand patients are on an avera~e annually
recei \'ed into the hospitals, and nineteen thousand old and infirm paupers
into the hospice5 or asylums. The annual revenues of these establish-
ments, amounting tq from ten to twelve millions of francs, are mostly
derived from property upon lease, gifts and bequests, a share of the
entrance duties, of receipts at the theatres, and of the profits from the
l\Iont de Piete, an establishment for the loan of money on pledges.
The annual expenditure averages about six millions. These institutions
are under the superintendence of government: most of them are di-
rected by a general council, under which an administrative commission
is charged with the executive power. At the head of each establishment
is placed a chief or superintendent, by whom its interior economy is
regulated, and tu who:sc authority all the persons employed in the
establishment are subject.*
The council has a central office, at which twelve physicians and six
surn·con5 preside: these are elected by concours, or public competition
of ~mdidates. Patients obtain medical ad vice nnd relief, on application
at the central office, and, if their case requires it) a ticket of admission
to a hospital
Hospital physicians aml surgeons are usually chosen from among the
members of the central oi1ice. They are in general exceedingly regular
in their attendance, make their visits at an early hour every morning,
and during the visit avail themselves of every opportunity of imparting
clinical information to the students. Pal ients are minutely examined,
and the daily progress of their case taken in WI iting by a clinical clerk

attached to each professor. After the visit the professors of the faculty,
anp some others, give clinical lectures, and see out-patients.
The professional attendants are assisted by numerous internes, and
externes. The duties of the internes are similar to those of house-
physicians and surgeons in England. They are elected, by concours,
for two years, at the expiration of which period they may be re-elected
for two additional years. They board and lodge in the house, and
receive a small salary. The externes are also elected by concours for
a period of three years, and perform the duties of dressers, but do not
reside in the house. Each professor is also attended in his visit by a
student of pharmacy, who notes down the medicines prescribed, and
sees that they are properly prepared. All drugs and officinal prepara-
tions are supplied from a central dispensatory, but prescriptions are
prepared in the hospitals.
The more immediate attendance on the sick is perfornied by the
sceurs de la charite, a sisterhood whose lives are passed in this bene-
volent occupation. l\'fale and female attendants, termed £nfirmiers,
acting under the orders of the sisters, perform the more laborious
duties.
The Ecole de JJfedecine is a handsome edifice, occupying oue side
of the Place of the same name. The central portion consists of the
amphitheatre, perhaps the finest in Europe, capable of containing an
audience of fifteen hundred persons. The other portions of the building
contain, on the first floor, the museum, the library, the cabinets of botany,
materia medica, and surgical instruments. The museum is small, and
is but indifferently furnished with anatomical and pathological prepa-
rations. The wax models are very inferior to those at Florence and
Bologna: the cabinet of pathological \vax models is, however, interesting
and contains several ~ood specimens of malformation, and rare cases.
The library is provided with an extensive collection of books and
plates, on medicine, surgery, and the accessory sciences. It is open
daily for the convenience of students. The professors of the faculty
deliver lectures on the various branches of professional education in
the amphitheatre. Clinical lectures are given at the different hospitals.
A neat hospital, containing about one hundred and fifty beds, has
been recently erected opposite the Ecole de 1\Iedecine, for purposes of
clinical instruction.
The Faculty of l\Iedicine is composed of a Dean, two assessors and
the following professorships:- anatomy, physiology, chemistry' me-
dical physics, ~ur~ical pathol?g.Y, medic?l.pathol.of?y, general path~logy
and therapeutics, botany, chmcal medtcme, chmcal surgery, clinical
midwifery."'
C~ndidates for the ?iploma of Doctor. in l\I~dicine. or Surgery, are
reqmred to ha\·e studied four years, dunng which perwd they h•lVe to
take out an inscription every three months for attendance on the
lectures and hospitals. J\Iembers of foreign colleges and universities
may, l~oweve.r, present them~elves for e_xamination after two years'
study 111 Pans. The scholastic year begms on the first of November

and terminates on the thirty-first of August. The expense of the
course of study required for taking a degree does not exceed a thousand
francs. (£40.)
The follo\\'ing is the prescribed order of study:
lst. Half-year.-Anatomy, Physiolo<Ty, Chemistry.
2d. Medical Physics, Hygiene, l\Iedi'cal Natural History.
::Jd. Anntomy, Physiology, Operati\·e Sur<Tery.
4th. Hygiene, l\Iedical Pathology, Pharma~y.
5th. Operative Surgery, :Medical and Surgical Pathology.
6th. Clinicall\Iedicine, Clinical Surgery, Materia l\fedica.
7th. Clinical 1\Iedicine, Cli·nical Surgery, l\Iedical Pathology.
8th. 1\tledical Jurisprudence, Therapeutics, Obstetricity.
The examinations for the diploma are five in number. The first
takes place after the fourth inscription has been taken out; the second
after the twelfth inscription: the three remaining examinations take
place at the termination of the course of study.
The subjects of the first examination are, natural history, physics,
medical chemistry, pharmacology; 2d, anatomy ar..d physiology ; 3d,
general pathology, medical and surgical pathology; 4th, medical juris-
prudence, hygiene, materia medica, and therapeutics; 5th, clinical
medicine and surgery, operative surgery, and obstetricity.
Each examination lasts two hours, during which four candidates are
questioned by three examiners.
For the anatomical examination the candidate is required to make a
preparation from a part of the body, which is indicated to him on the
same morning, and to answer questions proposed to him relative to the
preparation. Candidates have also to write and defend a thesis on some
point relative to medicine or surgery. The clinical examinations take
place in the clinical hospital at the bedside of patients. The examina-
tion fees amount to one hundred and fifty francs.
The Ecole pratique \Vas instituted for promoting a spirit of emulation
among the students. The number of pupils is restricted to one hundred
and twenty, who are elected by concours, and divided into three classes,
viz. of the first year, second year, and third year. Examinations fre-
quently take place, and prizes are distributed. Pupils of the Ecole
pratique are eligible to the offices of anatomical demonstrator and
assistant demonstrator, which are also determined by concours. De-
monstrators hold their appointment for a year, and receive each a salary
of twelve hundred francs. The .same person may be re-elected for
three successi\"e years.
The dissecting rooms of the Ecole pratique are airy and commodious,
great attention being paid to cleanliness. T~e facilities for. tl~e study of
practical anatomy are very great, and on this account Pans IS annually
resorted to by students from England, Germany, and Italy. These
facilities have however some disadvantage, in the inducement they offer
to students to hurry through their dissection in a careless manner. A
cause of the greater neatness of dissection observed in the English
schools is no doubt to be attributed to the comparative scarcity of bodies.
The Salpetri'ere.-This vast establishment, situate at the south-eastern
extremity of Paris, is composed of several buildings, constructed with

regularity, and inclosing spacious gardens and grounds for exercise.
The population amounts to six thousand individuals, the f?reater part
consisting of aged and infirm females, the remainder of patients.of the
same sex afflicted with mental alienation,epileptic and cancerou.s diseases.
The inmates sleep in laru-e \varus, containing from thirty to srxty beds.
which however are pla~ed too close to each other. The meals are
served up in the wards, there being no dining-rooms. Those ."~ho
require medical attendance are transferred to the infirmary, contamwg
two hundred and fifty bed~, which arc mostly occupied by cases of
chronic (Tastric, and bronchial affections, diseases of the heart, and
paralysis~ The number of insane patients averages from nine hundred
to one thousand. This department of the establishment has been much·
improved of late years, owing in great measure to the exertions formerly
made by the venerable Pinel.
The patients are classed in three divisions, viz. curable, incurable, and
idiots. The medical superintendence of the first division is confided to
1\1. Pariset, of the second to l\I. Mitivie~ of the third to lVI. Falret.
Tranquil patients, and those under treatment.• are lodged in clean and
airy wards, each containing from twenty to forty beds. Of the incu-
rable, the more intractable and furious patients, some occupy wards,
others small cells built round court-yards on the ground-floor. Each of
the cells lodges one person, contains no other furn;ture than a bed, and
has a grated window with a shutter. When violent, the patient is
confined to her cell, and the shutter closed; the isolation and darkness
is often sufficient to restore quiet, without resorting to the straight waist-
coat, which is the only means of forcible restraint employed. In general,
however, the patients walk about the courts in the day-time, and are
superintended by females, who appear to treat them with kindness and
gentleness. Moral measures are not much employed in the treatment,
which chiefly consists in the use of mild purgatives, baths, douches, and
counter irritation by means of blisters. In some cases of maniacal ex-
altation, cauterisation of the nape of the neck is used with very
advantageous results. Sanguineous depletion is not frequently resorted
to, nor are opium and other sedatives often employed. There is a
sepa.rate ward for conval~scents, wl~o employ their tin:e in reading and
sewmg. Another ward IS appropriated to the paralytic patients. The
paralysis supervening on mental alienation is mostly of a general nature
in which the faculty of volition first appears to partake of the debilit~
of the intellectual powers. Its approach is generally indicated by loss
of memory and confusion of ideas; the tongue and muscles of the mouth
then become affected, and the inferior extremities are, soon afterwards
unable to support the body. lVI. Pariset does not employ depletio~
or debilitating measures in these cases-counter irritation and the nux
vomica are also inefficacious. Paralysis most frequently supervenes in
elderly persons, who have been long insane.
Biceb·e* is an institution for the male sex, similar to the Salpetriere
situate two leagues from Paris. Its population is about three thousand
persons, including the insane. Two physicians and a surgeon have

c~arge of those inmates whose health requires medical assistance. The
cltseascs most frequent in the infirmary are apoplexy, paralysis, chronic
hronchial irritation, rheumatism, and affections of the urinary passa<re.
There is also a department for seventy-six patients afflicted with c~n­
cerous disease. :l\Iessrs. FetTus and Lelut are the professional atten-
~lants. of the insane, and have seen the amelioration~ proposed by Pinel
In thts department carried into effect ; the number of attendants is also
augmented. There are spacious grounds for exercise, as also a farm
where sixty of the patients are employed. The average number of
insane in the establishment is three hundred and sixty; seYeral are
paralytic. 'Vhet·e this complication exists, the cases are always incura-
ble. From twelve to fifteen individuals leave the hospice monthly :
the deaths amount to about the same number, the cures from seven to
eight.
The Afaison Royal de Charenton, situate a short distance from
Paris, is exclusively appropriated to the reception of the insane of both
sexes. The house is built on a slight acclivity, and contains six hundred
beds. The disposition of the building is not, howe,·er, according to l\I.
Esquirol, well calculated for the efficient treatment of the patients. The
following statistical account is from the same authority-from 182G to
1833, one thousand five hundred and ftfty-seven patients wet·e admitted.
viz. nine hundred and thirty-two men, six hundred and twenty-fn·e
women. 'Vith respect to season,-in spring, four hundt·ed and six,-
summer, four hundred and forty-five,-autumn, three hundred and sixty-
fi,re,-winter three hundred and forty-one. The maximum of admis-
sions with respect to age is from twenty-five to thirty for men, from
thirty-five to forty for women. It must not, however, be inferred from
this, that insanity is more frequent at these periods than later in life, as
the number of individuals of the same age diminishes in proportion to
the advanced period of life. The causes were in the following propor-
tion,-hereditary predisposition, three hundred and thirty-seven,-
domestic chagrins, two hundt·cd and seventy-eight,-reverse of fortune,
forty-nine,-political circumstances, in 1830, thirteen, in 18:31, fifteen,
in 183.:!, three, and in 1833, one only. ·
The Flospice de la .Lllaternite, or Lying-in-Hospital, contains four
hundred and fifty beds. \Vomen who have passed the eighth month
of pregnancy are received on application, without any questions being
asked as to name, residence, &c. They receive every requisite atten-
tion until after their accouchement, beyond which the majority do not
remain more than eight or nine Jays, and have the option of leaving
their infant in the hospital. The greater number are unmarried, and
avail themselves of this permission. .A physician, two surgeons, and a
midwife, arc attached to the establishment. One hundred and fifty
females studying midwifery, reside in the house, and assist in the prac-
tical part of the duties; after a certain period they undergo an examina-
tion, and take out a licence to practice. About three thousand five
hundred accouchements take place annually ; the average mortality is
one in twenty-two cases. Visitors and students are not admitted, in
order that the inmates may be more sure of concealment.
Near the former, and situate in an open and healthy part of the suburbs,
18 FRENCH MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.
is the Hospice des Enfans-trouves, where between five and. si~ thou-
sand infants are annually received on presentation. The a~rniSSI?ns, at
night, take place by means of a revolving; box, communicatmg With the
porter's lodge and the street ; the infant is placed in the box, and a b?ll
rung to apprize the porteress; the box is then turned round, and Its
occupant becomes a protege of the establishment. .
.Most of the infants remain but a short time in the house, bemg sent
into the country as soon as nurses can be procured for them. 1n this
there is no difficulty, as there are always several women in attendance.
During their stay, healthy infants are suckled by resident nurses, and
are placed in a large ward termed La Cr~che, containing one hundred
cradles. The sick are transferred to the wards of the infirmary, which
also contains about one hundred cradles. The wlrds are airy, and great
attention is paid to cleanliness. Notwithstanding these circumstances,
and the advantageous situation of the building, three-fourths of the
infants received into the infirmary die. A principal cause of this im-
mense mortality is the privation of the breast ; the artificial food, com-
posed of milk more or less diluted, and of light farinaceous substances,
disC"Igreeing with the infants, produces gastric irritation and diarrhrea,
under which they succumb. It appears to me that the medical treat-
ment, consisting for the most part of expectant measures, is not suited
to the class of cases, which are mostly of an inflammatory nature. The
remedies principally consist in baths, emollient enemata, and demulcent
drinks. Leeches and counter-irritants are sometimes used, laxatives
Yery seldom. The limited num her of nurses, and the manner in which
the bodies of the infants are bandaged up, so as to prevent free motion
of the limbs, have also an influence in increasing the proportion of
deaths.
Many of the little patients are afflicted with induration of the cellular
texture, which exists both as a distinct affection and as a concomitant of
other diseases, especially jaundice. It is in some cases general, but
n:-ore frequently the che7ks, thighs, legs, and back, are separately or
Simultaneously affected ; It generally comes on a few days after birth,
and is immediatelr reco~nised by the hardness of the affected parts to
the touch : the skm retams the reel colour of new-born infants. Dis-
section throws no light upon the causes of the disease. Paletta attri-
buted it to mechanical obstruction of the circulation. M. Billard con-
siders it to depend upon general plethora and a conrrestive state of the
venous system, cold and humidity acti~g as the exciting causes.* l\I.
Baron ~ls~ regards exposure to cold as It~ most fr~quent exciting cause.
The slnn IS generally dry, and .the.cure IS e~sy, If perspiration can be
produced. The treatment consists 111 abstractiOn of blood in some cases
in application of warm flannels, frir.tion, water and vapour baths. '

OBSERVATIONS ON CONTINENTAL PRACTICE.
TnE profession in France is divided into physicians, surgeons, and
o.f!iciers de sante, an inferior grade, whose practice is restricted to the
slighter cases of disease and the minor operations. Some physicians
and surgeons practise midwifery : this department is, however, for the
most part, in the hands of female practitioners, who are required to go
through a certain course of study before they are licensed to practise.
Apothecaries are not allowed to prescribe, their business being confined
to the selling of drup;s, and the preparation of prescriptions, as with
chemists and druggists in England.
.:Members of the profession on the Continent do not enjoy so high a
degree of estimation in society as in England ; and the scale of remu-
neration is much lower. The trifling expense of the course of study
allows admission to many of the poorer class of individuals, who would
be excluded in England by the expenses attendant on their education.
Many students exist upon one thousand francs, or even less, per annum,.
and in case of sickness are necessitated to become inmates of the hos-
pitals, where they find more attention and advantages than could be
expected in their comfortless apartments. They are, however, for the
most part, exceedin~ly anxious to acquire information, read hard, and
are attentive and regula!' in attendance on the hospitals and lectures :
each individual being aware of the necessity of personal exertion, and
that, in consequence of the public competition on the occm·rence of every
vacancy, talent and application are the only passports to distinction.
Most medical elections are decided by concours ; which has many
ad vantages over the method adopted in England. It certainly affords
the best guarantee to the public and to hospital patients, of the skill of
their professional attendants: and on the Continent, where medical es-
tablishments are strictly public, no other plan could be so well followed.
It is not likely, however, to be speedily adopted in England, where
these establishments nrc supported by the benevolence of individuals,
who naturally consiuer themselves entitled to take part in their internal
management. Under the present system, the voice of public opinion
and criticism, far more strongly expressed in England than elsewhere,
and the judicial investigation which ensues on fatal cases, where sus-
picions of improper treatment exist, are the principal securities for the
capabilities of hospital professional attendants.
The number of practitioners who adhere to purely expectant measures
in the treatment of disease is now extremely limited. The number of
exclusive Broussaists is also very small, although many of the profession
still incline to the principles of that doctrine. The majority, however,
appear to be reverting to the principles of the Medecine Hippocratique,
which, Jess disposed to generalize and to consider inflammation present
in most diseases, adopts less energetic measures, the practice being
rep;ulatecl by the actual cor.dition of the symptoms in individual cases.
The hospital practice of men professing Clppmite opinions is not,
20 OllSERVATIONS ON
however, so different as might be expected from ~ perusal of their
works. A pharmaceutical combination of drugs 1s not frequently
employed, the remeclies being moslly of a simple natul'e, and exc_ept the
difference in reo-ard to sanguineous depletion; tisanes, clecoct10ns ?f
simple herbs, m~cilaginous ancl sweetened bevel'ages, joined to tepid
baths ancl enemata, are the medical means mostly used in t.he p;reat
majority of cases. The leaclin~ feature of the Broussai:-~n cloctrrne I~, .as
is pretty generally known, the reference of fever to a local orrgrn.
This was considered to be inflammation, in a greater or less degree, of
the mucous membrane of the stomach and bowels, which was supposed
to be present in the greater number of acute, and in many chronic
diseases: hence the practice mainly consisted in the avoidance of all
stimulants, tonics, purgatives, or any medicine likely to irritate this
membrane; and in the employment of abstinence or liquid diet, occa-
sional blood-letting, the repeated application of leeches to the abdomen,
and the administration of aciclulatecl cooling drinks. At present,
however, when it is becoming evident to many practitioners that the
inflammatory lesions met with in fever are more frequently effects than
causes, this treatment is less rigidly adopted: remedies formerly alto-
gether proscribed are now more often used, and the results are a dimi-
nution of the generally diffusecl apprehension of gastro-entirite among
the profession, as also of the mortality among the patients.
The periodicity of diseases was always a stumbling-block in the way
of the B:-oussaian doctrine, and was attempted to be got over by a
theory of the intermission of inflammations. Thus intermittent fevers
were regarded as periodical inflammations of the alimentary canal,
notwithstanding which, bark continued to be resorted to for their cure.
This opinion is, I believe, now generally abandoned. An influential
author expresses himself on the subject of intermittents in these terms:
-"And \\'e have until the present time defended this opinion; but it
now appears to us that their nature resides in the blood, and that
the nervous and inflammatory symptoms by which they show them-
selves are but the effects of the contact of the miasm on the nervous
centres and princij)al organs; especially on the digestive passarres, parts
which we have seen in all cases of poisoning \Vhere a history of the case
preceded, almost constantly the first to feel the effects of different
poisons, in whatever manner introduced into the system."*
An apprehension of exciting inflammation in the alimentary canal
still, howeve.r, acts as a .bugbear in pr~ven~ing th~ employment of
many remedies from whtch advantage IS dady denved in England.
The same fear has probably given rise to the plan followed in many
cases, of introducing medicines by an abraded or blistereJ surface 011
the skin, or what is termed the metlwde endermique. It is obvious
that this methocl is only applicable when the substances to be introJuced
are sma!l in .q~an!ity, or exist in the .concentrated. s.tate, as quinine,
strychmne, chgrtahs, the salts of morphw, &c. MediCmes so adminis-
tered are said to be as efficacio~Is as when taken into the stomach ; and
there is no doubt the plan might be advantageously adopted 111 cases

where, from irritability of this viscus, substances introdueed by the
mouth are with difficulty retained.
The diffusion of Bmussaian principles has produced one beneficial
effect, in substituting for the comparatively inert measures formerly
employed: a more ener~etic practice in acute disease. Sanguineous
depletion, general and local, is now more resorted to, and repeated
oftener, than in England : its frequent employment and repetition being
rendered the more necessary on the Continent from the circumstance
that it is not, as with us, seconded by medicines which increase the
secretions, and which in their effP-cts, though often equivalent to the
abstraction of blood, do not induce so much consequent debility.
These medicines have, moreover, the advantage of procuring the removal
of noxious matters, and thereby relieving the system of a powerful
cause of the febrile re-action and nervous irritability which so frequently
supervene upon the loss of blood, and which are too often mistaken for
a condition requiring further depletion: so that where bleeding has
been repeatedly employed, if the progress of the disease be not checked
at its outset, the strength of the patient is greatly reduced, and he has,
in the favourable cases, to support a tedious convalescence.
As the bodies of patients dying in the hospitals are examined,
immense opportunities are afforded for the advancement of morbid
anatomy; and the numerous valuable works which exist on the subject
bear testimony to the zeal with which this important branch of
medical knowledge is studied by French practitioners, who by this
means are enabled to arrive at much greater accuracy of diagnosis in
many diseases than the majority of the profession on this side of the
channel. Such being the case, it appears surprising that so little im-
provement should have taken place in the treatment of disease in French
hospitals: this may however, in my opinion, be accounted for by two
circumstances ;-first, that post-mortem lesions, the effects of disease,
are often mistaken for its cause, and consequently the treatment must
be less successful than one based merely upon the observation of
symptoms; and secondly, that a routine line of practice is adopted
against diseases; sufficient attention not being paid to the various modifi-
cations the same disease may assume in different persons, the patient's
constitution, strength, and other peculiarities of his case not being
sufficiently taken into account.
In the treatment of chronic disease, hygienic measures, simple in-
fusions, and mineral waters, are extensively used; compound medicines,
stimulants, tonics, purgatives, sedatives, mercurials, &c. being seldom
employed in comparison with the English practice in this respect. No
doubt active medicines are too freely given in England in many cases
of chronic disease, and it will be admitted by those in extensive practice,
that great and irreparable injury has been frequently caused by the
indiscriminate use of mercury, as formerly employed, especially in
nervous and dyspeptic cases. The mode in which the majority of
En~lish practitioners are remunerated, viz. in proportion to the quantity
of medicine sent, has most likely induced the habit which many persons
have acquired of closing themselves with active medicines on every
trivial deviation from a state of health. The sooner this system of
3
22 OBSERVATIONS OX
remuneration is altered, the better will it be both for practitioners and
patients. ·
On the other hand baths which are constantly· used on the Contment,
' ' h
are but seldom resorted to in EnO'land as a remedial means. Althoug
I cannot say much of the advant~ge of tepid bathing in febril~ .and in-
flammatory diseases, I have no hesitation in stating my op.mwn, th.at
the more <reneral usc of baths in chronic complaints, particularly m
deranO'eme""nt of the di<restive passages and in nervous diseases co-ex-
istinO'

with such deran:cment, would be highly beneficial in alleviating
the symptoms, and sh;rtening the duration of these affections. I ha~·e
no doubt that the tendency to these complaints, as well as to bronchial
irritation and rheumatism, would be diminished, if persons in health
were accustomed to re<rulate the functions of the skin by this means
e . . .
more frequently than is generally the case. It Is a cunous circumstance,
that notwithstanding the numerical disproportion of inhabitants, ~nd
greater density of its atmosphere, London possesses fewer bathmg
establishments than perhaps any other large metropolis.
The practice of abstracting blood and applying irritants at a con-
siderable distance from the seat of the disease, on the principle of re-
vulsion, might be more frequently adopted with advantage in England,
especially in affections connected with cerebral irritation or congestion;
these cases are often singularly benefited by a small bleeding from the
ankle, a few leeches to the thighs or anus, blisters to the legs, sinapisms
to the feet, &c.
An important advantage is possessed by French over most English
practitioners, in the investigation of the morbid phenomena which take
place in the thoracic and abdominal viscera, by means of auscultation
and percussion, by which much of the obscurity and uncertainty enve-
loping several diseases is removed. The importance of these essential
aids in the formation of a correct diagnosis cannot fail to be properly
appreciated in England, as a knowledge of them becomes more exten-
s~vely diffused. It is true that long observation and practice are requi-
Site to enable one to define accurately the more minute varieties of
structural change, and even the most experienced may be led .into error
if the general symptoms be not taken into account. This, however is
no argument against the study of auscultation and percussion bei'nO'
u!·ged upon pupils following. the prac~ice .of public institutions, espe~
cially as the patients are subjected to httle Inconvenience and the prin-
cipal diagnostic signs furnished by these means may b: learned in a
short time.
In several points connected with the treatment of surO'ical disease
there exists a material difference between England and tl~e Continent'
The most prominent of these consists in the absence of internal treat~
ment in most surgical cases, by which surgery is reduced to little more
than the application of dressings and. !he _rer.form?nce of operations.

measures influencing the progress of the local disease, by their operation
on the general system. Among these measures, I may mention the
attention paid to the regulation of the functions of the chylopoietic
viscera, the use of laxative, tonic, sedative, and alterative remedies,-
of mE'rcury, alkalis, and the pharmaceutical combination of medicines.
These means are found, by daily experience, to influence in a i·emarka-
ble manner the course of various local diseases, especially chronic
inflammation in various textures, cachectic affections, ulcers, tumours
of the breast and other parts, diseases of the joints, of the testicles, of
the eyes, of the bones, and periosteum, many nervous affections, the
constitutional irritation, supervening on accidents and operations, or
occurrinp; during the progress of disease, as of stone in the bladder, &c.
The reasons which have been urged against the employment of inter-
nal medicines, viz. their liability to derange the general health, and to
produce morbid irritation of the alimentary canal, can only apply to
the abuse, and not to the proper use, of remedies, and consequently do
not require refutation.
\Vith respect to mercury, its action on the capillary system of vessels,
and consequent effects in controlling inflammatory disease, do not
appear to be known, or, if known, are not appreciated by continental
practitioners. Calomel is generally considered merely as a purgative,
and is occasionally administered as such. One writer in a popular
work even says, that this medicine is almost entirely inert, and may be
given in large quantities with impunity.* Several practitioners of
influence are, however, sensible of the value of this remedy in local
disease. Thus .M. Biett employs it in many cutaneous complaints. l\I.
Sanson also employs it in small doses, frequently repeated, in some
eases of ophthalmia.
In the remarks I formerly published, I stated that patients who died
in eontinental hospitals after accidents or operations, usually succumbed
to causes which a better regulated treatment would in many cases pre-
vent or remove ; more recent observation has not inclined me to alter
this opinion. In these cases the general treatment chiefly resolves
itself into ri~id abstinence for a long period, venesection, the topical
abstraction of blood, the use of emollient or sweetened tisane, and an
occasional enema. It is a common circumstance to see patients labour-
ing under serious disease, and after accidents and operations, in whom
there has been no action of the bowels for six, eight, ten, or even more
days. I have no hesitation in stating that I have repeatedly seen patients
die from nervous irritation and internal inflammations, arising apparently
from no other causes than abstinence from food, and a constipated state
of the bowels. The apprehension of gastro-enteritic irritation is urged
as the reason for the non-employment of laxatives ; the circumstance
appearing to be overlooked, that the continued presence of excremental
matter would tend more surely to cause fever and inflammation, both
as a direct irritant, and from the absorption of noxious particles. In
fact, where the irritation produced by this cause becomes evidenced
by pain and diarrhrea, the use of remedies which would relieve the
• Diet. de l\Iedecine et Chirurgie Pratique. Art. l\Iercure.
24 OBSERVATIONS ON
bowels from the source of these symptoms, is considered to be more
strongly contra-indicated.
In the parallel between Encrlish and French Surgery of 1\L Roux,
the English are accused of nof paying sufficient attention to the prepa-
ration of patients, by diet, medicine, &c. previous to the perfor.mancc
of operations. This is one among the many erroneous conclusi?ns at
'vhich l\I. Roux arrives, and I haye no doubt, that had the perwd. of
his visit been loncrer manv of his statements with respect to English
surgery would ha~e been ;ltered. Certainly, at. the pres~nt time, En-
(Tlish sur(Teons cannot be accused of underratmg the Importance of
preparato~y measures ; much more care is taken in Engl.and tha~ in
any part of the Continent which I have visited, to ascertam, prevwus
to the performance of an operation, whether the patient be in a fit state
with respect to general health, and freedom from visceral disease, to
undergo it with advantage.
The healing of wounds by granulation was till \Vithin these fenr years
pretty general in France; but the incontestible advantages of union by
the first intention, are now almost universally recognised. After
operations, however, primary union mostly fails to take place, which
is not to be wondered at, as the rigid abstinence to which patients are
subjected, and the enormous quantity of charpie and compresses with
which wounds are dressed, are more fit to faYour suppuration than to
prevent its occurrence. Arteries are now tied on the same principle
on the Continent as in England; a single ligature being applied, and
ligatures of reserve discarded. In operating for popliteal aneurism,
Hunter's method is generally adopted. A French author attributes
the invention of this operation to Anel, \vho tied the vessel between
the aneurism and the heart, several years before Hunter.* The principle
of Anel's operation and Hunter's is however essentially different. The
former tied the vessel close to the tumour, whereas Hunter placed the
ligature at a considerable distance from tile aneurism, where the
artery was more likely to be in a healthy condition; not so much with
the view of preventing altogether the passnge of blood into the tumour;
for he was well a\vare this would take plnce in many instances by
means of the anastomosing vessels, but chiefly to prevent the impetus
of the heart's action being transmitted to the aneurismal sac, and con-
sequently to remove the principal impediment to its obliteration.
The principles by which the treatment of fractures is directed are
also very similar on the Continent and in England. Fractures or' the
leg are treated in the extended position, with an apparatus resemblincr
the junk of the London hospitals. Those of the thicrh are also treated
in the extended position, by two splints extending tl~e whole lencrth of
the limb. \Vhen the fracture is near the neck of the bone the d~uble
inclined plane is usually preferred. lVlost French sur(T~ons are f

infers, from having seen two cases of ununited fracture in London, the
frequent occurrence of these accidents; at present, however, it is seldom
that cases of false articulation are met with even in the humerus, where
non~union occurs more readily than in other bones; most probably from
the circumstance, that as these patients are not confined to bed in
England, the fracture is not treated in the horizontal position, the
weight of the lower part of the limb tends consequently to separate the
fractured ends of the bone, unless care be taken to counteract this cause,
by givin~ due support to the· elbow.
Baron Larrey treats compound fractures by an apparatus, composed
of a junk and dressings, varnished over so as to exclude the air; this is
not removed during the whole period of treatment. This plan has
been tried in some of the Parisian hospitals, but the results have not
been such as to lead to its adoption. The apparatus of :\Ir. Amesbury
was employed a few years ago in some London hospitals, and also
offers the advanta~?;e of not requiring removal; the patient being able
to get about on crutches during the progress of the cure. It is, however,
most applicable in simple fracture; and in some cases which I treated,
consolidation appeared to be more quickly effected than by the ordinary
method.
In France and Italy much time is not often consumed by attempting
to reduce strangulated hernia, the operation being almost immediately
resorted to. A large proportion of these cases do well, but inflammation
is not unfrequently induced by the neglect of measures to obtain alvine
evacuations. \Vhere the early .performance of the operation combined
with the English mode of after-treatment, the number of unsuccessful
cases would be extremely limited. English patients who die in cases
of strangulated hernia, usually succumb in consequence of the length
of time lost in the employment of various means in succession, before
the constriction is removed; although these means effect reduction in
many cases, the inflammation generally runs high; and when they fail,
the chances of success are much diminished. It is therefore better,
when the symptoms are urgent, that an operation not in itself dangerous,
should be performed, even in some cases where it might be obviated,
than that it should only be resorted to as a last resource, and delayed
till the probabilities of success are materially lessened.
Surgeons on the Continent agree with those in England in considering
Gimbernat's ligament as the chief cause of constriction in femoral hernia.
Sir A. Cooper, however, states that this ligament can never occasion
the constriction; but is not Gimbernat's ligament the cause of the
narrowness of the crural ring, and of the state of tension in which this
part is maintained? And does not the division of its sharp edge admit
of a greater degree of relaxation without weakening the abdominal
parietes, than co'uld be obtained by a partial di,·ision of Poupart's
ligament? Doubtless, in some cases, the neck of the sac, and the
falciform edge of the fascia lata, may form exclusive causes of stricture,
though it is questionable whether this be frequently the case.
\Vhen lithotomy is ret}uired, the lateral operation is usually per-
formed, as in England, except that the bistouri cache supersedes the
cutting gorget. Of late years, however, the bi-lateral operation has
s~
26 OBSERVATIONS ON
been frequently performed with very successful results. Of seve?tY
patients of various ages operated on by .M. Dupuytren, six only died.
The principal advantages of this operation O\'er the lateral operatiOn are,
that the incisions are made at the widest part of the inferior. ap~rture
of the pelvis; the chances of dividing important vessels are di~mmsh_ed,
and the prostate gland being divided to an equal extent on ~1ther side
of the urethra, admits of the extraction of large calculi, without the
incision passing its circumference. The chief disadvantage is the danger
of wounding the rectum, which howe\'er may be averted by the
operator depressing the part with the fore finger of his left hand.
Lithotomy will, however, be superseded in many cases by lithotrity;
although I question if this latter admits of such universal application as
its advocates would lead us to believe. In children it is less applicable
than lithotomy. The hardness of the calculus is also an objection to
its employment. In many old persons labouring under enlargement of
the prostate, the difficulties of lithotrity are increased, and the success
less probable, in consequence of the retention of the fragments of the
stone. Indeed this circumstance, and the lodging of fragments in the
prostatic portion of the urethra, constitute t'vo of the chief drawbacks
on lithotrity. The method by perforation, as employed by l\'1. Civiale,
is now less generally adopted than that of breaking down the calculus
by means of Jacobson's and Heurteloup's instruments; these operations
are now so greatly simplified, as to be easy of performance; and much
of the complicated apparatus formerly considered essential, is dispensed
with by some operators.
Flap amputations are now less frequently performed in France than
a few years ago. Amputations at the articulations are however more
frequent than in England. .IVL Dupuytren used to amputate the thio-h
and arm by a circular incision at once through the skin and muscks
down to the bone. The traction effected by the assistant, gave to the
wound the form of a cone; the operator then made another circular
incision at the base of this cone, and on a level with the cut surface of
the skin, by which the projecting flesh was divided, and the bone sawn
through higher up than could be effected by the usual method. This
operation has recently been advantageously modified, by first dividino-
~he skin and cellular bands which unite it to the subjacent muscles ; and
It appears to me to offer greater advantages than the ordinary mode of
circular amputation. The manner in \vhich stumps are dressed in
Parisian hospitals appears peculiarly calculated to produce febrile reac-
tion, and prevent union by the first intention. The edges of the wound
being main~ained in ~ontact \Yith adhesive s~raps, a perforated rag,
smeared With cerate, IS put on, and over this three or four thick
compres~es of charpie; o.ver these again .linen comJ?resses and bandages.
From this mode of dressi~g, the low .diet on '':hich patients are lana-
kept, and want of a.ttentiOn to obviate constipation, a very larrr~
proportion of amputatiOns arc unsuccessful. . 0

CONTINENTAL PRACTICE. 27
to co-exist with severe burns, sanguineous depletion is resorted to, and
with opium, cataplasms, or emollient dressings, are the means usually
employed in France. The application of ice to the head is strongly
recommended, whatever be the seat of the injury. This remedy is
said to cause speedy cessation of the pain, and to prevent cerebral
symptoms. The application need not be continued more than an hour
or two~ and should be discontinued when the pain has ceased.
Strictures of the urethra are treated in continental hospitals by rest
in bed, a catheter being kept in the bladder, and its size increased by
degrees. In cases of retention of urine, where great difficulty existed
in introducing a catheter, M. Dupuytren did not persevere in the
attempt, but adopted antiphlogistic measures; passed a bougie as far as
the impediment, and fixed it there. An abundant mucous secretion was
produced, which allowed the bougie to be passed a little further into
the urethra at the expiration of a felV hours. It was again fixed in its
new position, and thus proceeding by degrees, did not fail to arrive at
the bladder.
Cold applications are less frequently used in France and Italy than
in England. This is the more surprising, as the beneficial effects of
this remedy must be apparent on trial. On the other hand, however,
the agency of heat is much more frequently had recourse to, and the
actual cautery is not unfrequently applied. Baron Larrey employs this
remedy in some cases of erysipelas to which in England cold lotions
would be considered better adapted.
Diseases of the eyes do not appear to have received the same degree
of attention in France as in England and Germany, the practice being
in general very inferior. Although abounding in establishments for the
treatment of special diseases, Paris does not possess any ophthalmic
institution; patients with diseases of the eyes being received into ordi-
nary hospitals, to the great detriment of their general health. They are
for the most part treated by local applications, constitutional measures
being seldom resorted to. A dispensary for ophthalmic diseases has,
ho,vever, recently been established by l\1. Sichel, a German physician;
which is much resorted to by pupils, and where these affections are
treated with great success, principally by constitutional measures, varied
according to circumstances.
The treatment of uterine disease is better, and less empirical in
France than in England, where the great objection to ocular and manual
examination too frequently prevents patients obtaining relief, and con-
sequently the nature of the disease often becomes evident only when too
late to be remedied. It appears to me that these diseases, as well as some
others which supervene upon difficult parturition, are more prevalent
in France than in England ; which may partly be caused by the practice
of midwifery being in the hands of females in the former country.
Having thus taken a cursory view of some of the leading differences
in England and continental practire, I shall proceed to give an account
of the principal hospitals.
28
PARISIAN HOSPITALS.
HOTEL DIEU.
THrs larrre hospital is built on one of the branches of the Seine. The
two portio1~s of the building are united by a wide covered bridge, which
serves as an exercise ground for patient.s. The number of beds is twelve
hundred,-that of the patients usually averages from nine hundred to
nine hundred and fifty. The majority of these are physicians' patients,
labouring under acute disease, not more than two hundred and twenty-
four beds being appropriated to the surgical cases. The wards are large,
clean, and, though not lofty, are pretty well ventilated : attached to
each bed is a statement of the period of admission, age, sex, occupa-
tion, &c. of its occupant. Three surgeons and ten physicians, assisted
by several clinical clerks, internes, and externes, perform the professional
duties, and make their visits every morning between the hours of six
and nine. Operations are performed, elinical lectures delivered, and
out-patients seen in the large amphitheatre. The average mortality in
this hospital is one in eight.
In l\1. Dupuytren, for many years the principal surgeon of this
hospital, were presented a tact and quickness in seizing indications of
treatment, joined to a precision of diagnosis and dexterity in the per-
formance of operations, rarely met with. By his genius, the patholouy
of several diseases, formerly little understood, has been elucidated ; a~d
the advantages of many improved methods of treating surrrical disease
which he suggested, .a~e daily b~coming more manifest. b Although a
knowledge of the opmwns of this celebrated professor is pretty exten-
sively. diffus~d by the pub~ica~ion of his "L:e<;ons Orales," yet the
followmg bnef sketch of his VIews on some Important diseases may
prove acceptable to those of the profession who are debarred from a
perusal of his work.

accidents and operatiOns, and which, hke dehnum tremens is marked
by insomnia, continual restlessness, and absence of fever, ;vas treated

sleep, after the failure of other means. This kind of delirimn 1 uce

'Vounds of arteries, if recent, arc best treated by placing a ligature
PARISIAN HOSPITALS. 29
on the vessel between the wounded part and the heart. The only
exception to this rule is when the artery is wounded near the extremity
of a limb ; in which case, in consequence of its free communication
with inosculating branches, it is requisite to place a ligature both above
and below the wounded part. A similar proceeding is required when
the lesion of the vessel is of long standing, as the edges of the wound
are then incapable of adhesion.
Gonorrhreal ophthalmia mostly occurs from inoculation, but may
supervene on suppression of the urethral discharge, especially if the
patient have been at the same time exposed to cold, or other exciting
causes of ophthalmia. It should. be treated by general and local deple-
tion, revulsives, and emollient lotions. These measures are however
insufficient, unless combined with the insufflation of a pinch of finely-
levigated calomel, upon the ocular and palpebral conjunctiva, once or
twice a day. One or two drops of laudanum should also be dropped
between the eyelids in the evening. The purulent ophthalmia of infants
is essentially the same disease, and should be treated in a similar manner.
Strumous ophthalmia was considered by l\1. Dupuytren to depend on
inflammation of the retina, and was treated by the internal administra-
tion of belladonna, combined with other means indicated by the symp-
toms. From three to eight grains of the powder, or from one to three
gl'ains of the extract of belladonna, were divided into six doses : the
patient took one of these every two hours; to prevent narcotism, either
general or local, Seltzer water was usually administered at the same
time.
Gangrcna senilis is not, as its name would imply, restricted to old
persons. 1\'I. Dupuytren has termed the disease Gangrene sympto-
matique, believing it to depend upon inflammation and consequent
obliteration of the arteries of the limb,-ossification of the vessels, to
which it was formerly ascribed, being only an accidental coincidence,
-the treatment consisted in venesection, repeated according to the
urgency of the symptoms, low diet, cooling beverage, opium, and other
sedatives, with emollient cataplasms to the affected part. By this treat-
ment the average mortality is said to be as one to four. Previous to
amputating a part affected with long standin~ disease, l\I. Dupuytren
frequently established suppuration by means of blisters on some distant
point. It was also his practice, after amputations, to wait an hour,
sometimes longer, before dressing the stump: by this plan union by the
first intention took place more readily, and the likelihood of hemorrhage
was diminished.
In prolapsus ani, l\I. Dupuytren excised two, three, or more folds of
the skin on the margin of the anus, on either side. A similar operation
was recommended by .l\1r. Hey. No dressing is required, and the
recurrence of the disease is effectually prevented.
Fissures at the margin of the anus may be divided into three kinds:
-1st, those external to the sphincter, which are not very painful, and
do not occasion spasmodic contraction ; 2d, those situated within the
sphincter, affecting principally the mucous membrane-this kind causes
tenesmus, and great pain, especially on the patient's going to stool ;
3d, those placed on the same level as the sphincter, are more serious
30 PARISIAN HOSPITALS.
and psinful than the other kinds, which may generally be cured by
simple dressings, emollient lotions, and sedative applications; whereas
this ,·ariety requires the division of the sphincter on the fissure. l\I.
Dupuytren \Vas in the habit of prescribing an ointment composed of
extract of belladonna and acetate of lead, of each a dram, to an ounce
of lard, for alleviating the pain in these diseases.
l\I. Dupuytren preferrecl excisiun to the ligature for the rem?val of
uterine polypi, in consequence of the greater facility with which the
former is effected, and the few inconveniences it occasions when com-
pared with the latter method. The patient being placed in th~ same
position as for lithotomy, a speculum is introduced into the Yagma, so
as to exhibit the tumour, which is then seized with a strong four-hooked
tenaculum, with long handles, (pinces de museaux,) and gradually
brought dmvn through the inferior orifice of the vagina, the patient
being recommended during the traction to strain as if in labour : on
the division of the pedicle, the uterus immediately regains its usual
situation. The operation is not in general very painful, and bleeding
to any extent very rarely occurs.
Of the physicians of the Hotel Dieu, the visits and clinical lectures
of Professor Charnel are the most numerously attended. The opinions
of l\I. Charnel have always been opposed to the doctrines of Broussais,
especially as regards the essentiality of fevers. He considers continued
fever to depend upon a vitiated condition of the blood ; and in most
of the cases which have fallen under his observation, there has been an
eruption of small, round, reddish spots, occurring most usually after
the eighth day, and most abundant on the abdomen, thighs, and arms.
These he regards as peculiar to this disease. l\1. Charnel divides the
appearances met with on dissection into two kinds. First, those proper
to the disease, and almost constantly met with, viz. enlargement and
ulceration of the follicular glands of the small intestines, more especially
at their termination. These he regards not as the cause, but as a con-
sequence of the disease, a8 the extent of the lesion is by no means
proportioned to the intensity of the symptoms. The second kind of
morbid appearance, as inflammations of mucous membranes, or of
parenchymatous viscera, is of an accidental nature, and common to
many othei· diseases.
The opinions of French practitioners have undergone a considerable
change, within the last few years, with respeet to the nature of typhoid
fevers, which were extremely prevalent in Paris last winter, and various
methods of treatment were employed. Those who still rerrard them
as depending on local inflammation, adhered to depletion agd coolin<T
drinks: others, who with .i\1. Charnel take a different view of the sub~
ject> employ depletio.n more s~aringly, and trust more to antiseptics, as
the chloruret of sodiUm, and 111 some cases to bark and tonics : a few
practitioners employ purgatives in all cases. Of the instances that fell
under my observation, those patients treated by depletion, in whom
recovery took place, were such as could support the lo.ss of blood
without much inconvenience, in whom the more aggravated symptoms
were absent, and would in all pro~ability have recovered equally well
by the employment of less energetic measures. Many recoveries were
PARISIAN HOSPITALS. 31
also attributed to the chlorurets, but no marked benefit appeared to me
to be produced by them. More successful results were said to he
obtai ned by the puq~ative treatment than by the other methods. One
hundred and thirty-four cases of typhoid fever, treated by purgatives,
at the Hotel Dieu, produced the following result :-sixty-nine of
simple fever ;-all cured: forty-nine of adynamic fever ;-thirty-
nine cured, ten died; sixteen of ataxic fever :-seven cured, nine
died,-making nineteen deaths in the whole. These experiments will
go far to remove the apprehension of exciting gastro-enterite by these
remedies, which has hitherto prevented their employment in France,
and will prove to continental practitioners, that they have, since the
prevalence of the Broussaian doctrines, needlessly deprived themselves
of the great advantage which may be derived from this class of reme-
dies in the treatment of acute dise3.se. From a view of the above
results, it is also pretty evident, that had purgatives been less exclu-
sively employed in the adynamic and ataxic varieties, in which they
:-~re not so often indicated, the proportion of fatal cases would have
been smaller. In fact, the principal error of some continental phy-
sicians appears to me to be, that the remedies are not sufficiently varied
in the different stages of disease, according to special indications. Thus
one practitioner will invariably resort to blood-letting, and would on
no account employ purgatives or tonics, whatever be the condition of
the patient, or the stage of the disease ;-another will, perhaps, treat
the same disease in all cases by purgatives ;-another by large closes
of tartarized antimony and revulsives, to the exclusion of sanguineous
depletion and purgatives ;-a fourth by expectant measures; and each
will publish cases as illustrating the efficacy of his peculiar practice.
\Vith respect to the intestinal lesions so constantly observed in post-
mortem examinations of cases of typhoid fever in France, I am disposed
to think that they arc frequently occasioned by the presence of indurated
cxcrementitial matter, as they are almost invariably met with in indivi-
duals dying of this disease in Parisian hospitals where purgatives are
seldom used, ami where enemata which merely empty the large intes-
tines are generally employed ; 'vhereas in England, where purgatives
arc freely employed, and enemata in less frequent use, these lesions are
less con~tant and less extensive, the bronchial membrane and the brain,
which in these cases are not generally examined in France, being often
the seat of pathological alteration. Even in France, these alterations
do not exist in some individuals dying from typhus; and when ex-
istino-, they are most frequently met with, and in greatest number, in
that part of the intestine where an accumulation of fecal matter is most
liable to take place.
An account of the cases of typhus treated by 1\1. Charnel at the Hotel
Dieu, has been recently published, and will be read with ad,·antage.
The treatment consists in moderate abstraction of blood in the first
periods, mucilaginous and diluent drinks, bvements, and baths, to
"hich in many cases the chloruret of sodium is added. In the more
advanced stages, where stupor and great prostration of strength exists,
recourse is frequently had to blisters to the legs, nouri~hing broth,
wine, and baric

.In reading these cases, two circumstances will esp~cially att~act
attention ;-the infrequency of the employment of laxatives, ~o~\~tth­
standing the amelioration that followed their occasional exhtbitiOn :
and the constant aggravation of the symptoms, and often the fatal ter-
mination, of those cases in which venesection was practised a~te; the
sixth or eighth day from the invasion of the disease. I subjOin an
outline of one of these cases.
Bouchard, aO'ed twenty-five, had been ill a week previous to admission. On. the
eighth day he had a high degree of fever, intense cepha!algia, vomiting, and pu~gtng,
and was received into the hospital; on the followmg day, great prostratiOn of
strengh, stupor, subsultus tendinum, tongue rather dry, thirst, temperature of the
skin no higher than natural, pulse eighty, but little expanded, no abdominal tender-
ness, delirium in the night, with involuntary passage ofliquid evacuations.-Bleed-
ing to eight ounces, fomentation to the abdomen, a potion with syrup of gum, and
an emollient lavement.-The patient's condition became worse, and he died on the
twelfth day from the commenc'ement of the disease. The usual pathological altera-
tions of the small intestines and mesenteric glands were present on post-mortem
examination.
The following cases occurred during my attendance at the hospital,
and will further illustrate the practice pursued.
_l'ffetritis.-A young woman, aged twenty-five, was admitted on the 25th of
January, having continued indisposed ever since her accouchement, which occurred
twenty-four days before. On admission, the following symptoms were present:-
fever, pain extending all over the abdomen, more severe in the hypogastric region,
and aggravated by pressure, pains in the loins and thighs, pulse one hundred, firm,
tongue coated, os tincre and uterus tender to the touch, sanguineous discharge per
vaginam.- Venesection to twelve ounces, cataplasm to the hypogastric region,
drink of sweetened barley-water.
27th.-Less abdominal pain and tenderness, tongue loaded, bowels confined.-
Lavement, demulcent potion.
3lst.-Increased pain and tenderness of the abdomen, which is somewhat dis-
tended, pulse quick and irritable, skin hot, tongue loaded, scarcely any action of
the bowels since her admission. The venesection repeated yesterday afforded only
temporary relief-cataplasm to abdomen, emollient lavement, an ounce of castor
oil added to her potion.
Feb. lst.-The bowels have acted freely, and she feels much relieved; but there
is still considerable tenderness, _Par.ticularly i~ the left iliac region.-Twenty leeches,
demulcent beverage. From this time the pam and tenderness of hypo(J'astrium con-
tinued, though occasionally relieved by leeches, her countenance sank, and cou(J'h
supervened. Mercurial frictions were made on the abdomen, but without effect a~d
the patient died after having been a month in the hospital. The post-morte~ in-
spection exhibited. peritoneal inflammation, with effusion of lymph and serum;
between the postenor part of the uterus and the bladder an aperture existed which
appeared to have been made with some pointed instrument, probably with' the in-
tention of causing the death of the fretus.
Typhtts fever: effect of tonies.-A medical student was admitted on the 8th of
January, and .was bled shortly aft~r; but the .disease continued to make progress,
a~d after havtng b~en a fortmght In. the. hospital, he appeared in a sinking state,
with torpor of the Intellectual faculues, Involuntary passage ?f evacuations, counte-

l\I. Piorry's wards generally contain interesting cases of thoracic and
abdominal disease, paralysis from apoplectic attacks, &c. l\I. Piorry
inclines to the opinions of Broussais, and has devoted much of his time
to percussion, by which means he is frequently enabled to ascertain
with certainty the existence of disease of the thorax and abdomen,
when other means afford but an imperfect indication. He considers a
thin circular piece of ivory, which he has termed plessimetre, the best
medium for appreciating the varieties of sound furnished by percussion.
:\I. Piorry is in general Yery successful in his treatment of disease,
takes minute notes of cases, and varies his remedies according to par-
ticular exigencies. In cases of pneumonia he generally depletes freely,
and subsequently applies large blisters to the thorax. In pleurisy,
sanguineous depletion is not so energetically practised, counter-irrita-
tion being; more usually relied on, after the subsidence of the more
urgent symptoms. In bronchitis, l\1. Piorry frequently restricts himself
to the application of leeches, and the exhibitiOn of emollient drinks.
Neuralgic affectipns he treats by leeches, counter-irritants, or quinine,
according to existing indications.
Nervous affection and lu:emoptysis.-An unmarried woman, of delicate appearance,
aued twenty-four, was received on the lOth of l\Iarch into l\L Piorry's ward, com-
piaining of pain in the thorax and abdomen. She had had short and almost constant
cough for the last six months, preYious to whi~h period her health was good and
menstruation regular. Bleeding, blistering, and various remedies had been triP-d
without affording more than transient relief. She has no fever, no expectoration,
the tongue is clean, appetite good; she sleeps at night without cough. Percussion
and auscultation furnish no signs of disease, nor does her general appearance indi-
cate its existence, yet she complains much of pain, and shrinks when any part of
the thorax or abdomen is touched. I remarked that the cough, thongh constant
while any one was near her, was much less frequent and often ceased altogether,
when she was not conscious of being observed.-Low diet, sweetened gum-water,
with syrup of poppies.
l\farch 17th. No amelioration. On inquiring whether she has pain in thP- back,
she replies in the affirmative, and that it is her principal ailment, although she had
never previously mentioned this symptom. Pressure on the spinous processes of
the upper dorsal vertebrre causes much pain, which however is also complained of
when the skin is lightly pinched up, and when other parts of the body are similarly
treated.-Ten leeches to the abdomen, tisane with syrup of poppies.
23d. She derived no relief from the leeches, nor from a blister which was
subsequently applied; the cough and pain, with extreme sensibility oi the surface
to the touch, persist: she had yesterday an attack of hremoptysis with vomiting.
(Venp,section, demulcent potion.)
28th. She had a recurrence of the hremoptysis and vomitinu on the 25th, and the
venesection was repeated; since which she has been unabie to void her urine,
which is drawn off by the catheter; the cough and morbid sensibility of the surface
are somewhat diminished. She lool<s palP., and has lost flesh, but never complains
of pain in the back, unless allusion is made to it: no action of the bow~ls during
the last four or five days.-Castor oil, potion with syrup of poppies.
April Ist. During the last three days the acetate of morphine has been administered
by the methode endtrmique, her spirits are improved, she seldom coughs, and the
sensibility of the skin is much diminished.
From this period she gradually improved, and soon after left the hospital to go
into the country.
I have selected this from other cases of a similar nature, to direct
4
34 PARISIAN HOSPITAl,S.
attention to the morbid sensibility of the sl<in, which I have repeatc~Iy
seen, both in England and in continental hospitals, treated as In-
flammatory disease of subjacent organs, and also to allude to the
tenderness on pressing the spine, to which much importance has been
attached in a recent work, as indicating the seat of many ~crvous
affections.'* l\Iy attention was drawn to this symptom, previOus to
the publication of my work on these affections, by another author, \~ho
attempted to prove that it was constantly met with in cases ?f hystena.t
It is true that pain and tenderness along the course of the spmal colu~n
is frequently met with in nervous disease, but it is equally frequent In
other parts, and very often is not complained of until the patient's
attention is called to the part by mmute examination : the pain and
tenderness is cutaneous, and is often more severe \vhen the skin is
lightly pinched up, than when pressure is made. These, and other
symptoms, may often be determined at will, in many parts of the body
to which the patient's attention happens to be directed: much depend-
ing in these cases on the manner in which questions are put, and
examinations made. As, however, it is out of pla~e to enter here on
the consideration of this subject, I return to the practice of the Parisian
physicians.
l\I. Magendie has a female ward at the Hotel Dieu. His visits are
but thinly attended by pupils. In the treatment of disease, he frequently
employs the new remedies qescribed in his Formulaire, but I believe
the results are not more advantageous than those obtained by the
ordinary methods in the hands of other practitioners.
lVI. Recamier has also a thin attendance of pupils in consequence of
the irregularity of his attendance, and the hurried manner in which
his visits are generally made; in fact, the principal charge of his patients
devolves upon M. Trousseau. M. Recamier made experiments a few
years ago on the treatment of scirrhus and cancer by methodical com-
pression, and has published the result of his observations. This
method was· also tri~d at other hospitals, but is now very little
employed: and there IS no doubt that many of the cases cured were
merely simple chronic tumour. In a case of tumour of the breast
considered as scirrhous, and treated by this method, which fell uncle:
my observation when for?'lerly i.n ~aris, the p~tient was under thirty
years of ~ge, and the dwgnosttc signs of this disease were absent.
CompressiOn mostly procures, however, a speedy diminution in the
size of tumours, in consequence of the condensation of the cellular
texture and absorption of their less solid parts, but in those of a carci-
no~atous nature the di~in~tion doe~ n?t proceed beyond a certain
P?mt, ~nd the tumour agam mcreases In SIZe when the compression is
discontmued.

LACHARITE.
. TH~s hospit~l, situate in the Ru~ '(ucob, is a large unfinished building,
mclosmg ~paciOus court-yards. I he wards are long, well-ventilated,
and c.ontam about four hundred and fifty beds, which are mostly
occupied by patients labouring under acute disease. It is much resorted
to by out-patients with cutaneous disease, on account of the aromatic,
sulphur, fumitz;ation, and vapour baths with which it is provided.
The professional duties are performed by four physicians and two
surgeons.
l.VI. Roux, who has lately succeeded M. Dupuytren at the Hotel Dieu,
'~as during several years attached to this hospitaL He is justly con-
sHiered as one of the most expert operators in Europe, and has
simplified and facilit:!ted the performance of some operations formerly
but seldom undertaken on account of the difficulties which they pre-
sented. l.VL Roux, however, in common with other French surgeons,
seldom resorts to medicine in the treatment of surgical disease: hence,
in my opinion, one cause of the greater frequency of operatious, and
the greater mortality among the operated in Parisian than in British
hospitals.
During the period of my attendance in l\/
I. Roux's wards, several
interesting cases were received, among which were t\vo fractures of the
thigh. The first occuned in a middle-aged female in the centre of the
bone, and W:ls treated by tho apparatus of Boyer. In the other case
the patient was a female, aged seventy; and the fracture in the neck of
the bone. In this instance the double inclined plane was employed.
Although 1\-1. Roux believes that this fracture unites by bone, yet in the
present instance, on account of the advanced age of the patient, he
contents himself with keeping the limb at rest until the pain and swell-
ing have subsided: after which she will be allowed to get about on
crutches, as recommended in similar cases by Sir A. Cooper.
1/ernia.-A man, aged forty-five, was received with inguinal hernia of the right
side, which descended forty-eight hours previously, in consequence of some
exertion: the same circumstance •had already occurred several times, but the
tumour was always reduced without difficulty. Notwithstanding there was but
little pain in the part, and no abdominal tenderness or other symptoms of strangula-
tion, the operation for strangulated hernia was performed, after some slight efforts
had been made to reduce the tumour by the taxis. The sac was found to contain
omentum, not in an inflamed state, but which had contrar:ted slight adhesions, the
impediment to reduction exerted at the external ring. This was divided, and the
protruded part reduced without difficulty. No unfavourable symptom ensued.
Strangulated Hernia.-A man aged thirty-five was received on 21st February
with stran<Tulated inguinal hernia of the right side, which had existed twenty-four
hours. There was some abdominal tenderness, and the tumour was painful when
touched. The patient had only vomited once, after taking some tea. The operation
was almost immediately resorted to, and on opening the sac a portion of intestine of
a dark colour was exposed, which, after a division of the stricture, was returned
into the abdomen without difficulty. Simple dressing was applied to the wound,
and a tisane, containing a small quantity of sulphate of magnesia, was prescribed.

leg, occasioned by a cart wheel having passed over .tt. As there appeared to ·
Roux little probability of saving t?e. limb, amputatiOn was ,rerformed above the
knee, soon after the patient's admtsston. After the operation !be edges of the
wound were maintained in exact apposition by straps of adhestve plaster, over
which were placed two or three large pledgets of charpie, ~ompresse~ and bandage.
The patient wa;; bled in the course of the afternoon, but d1d not survtve more than
thirty-six hours.
In another patient the fore arm was amputated shortly after the occurre_nce of an
accident which caused a compound fracture and dislocation at the wnst. The
stump was dressed in the same manner as in the preceding case. For four or ~ve
days, during which the bowels were constipated, the patient appeared ~o be going
on pretty well. Phlebitis, how·ever, supervened, and speedily caused hts death.
Tumour of the neck.-A tumour about the size of a man's fist, occupying the
region of the parotid gland and angle of the jaw, was extirpated. The patient was
an old woman, 'vho lost a good deal of blood during the operation, and several
vessels wero tied. The wound wns pnrtly fillcJ with clnupic, ovor which a bandage
was pretty tightly applied. Though the patient did not complain the first few days
after the operation, her pulse was quick, skin hot, tongue furred, and bowels con-
stipated. No medicine except simple tisane was ordered. On the eighth day the
wound presented an unhealthy appearance, and erysipelas of an atonic character
extended over the face and neck of the same side. The patient wandered occa-
sionally in her talk, her skin was cool, pulse feeble, tongue furred and dry, bowels
.xelaxed. She was ordf'red meat broth, and a little wine, but no amelioration took
place, and she died after lir,gering a few days longer in a half dozino- state. No
visceral inflammation was observed on inspection of the body. "'
1\I. Bouillaud, Professor of Clinical l\Iedicine, is one of the most
zealous supporters of the principles of the medecine physiolocrique
and author of several highly estimated 'vorks. His wards l~uallj:
contain many cases of acute disease, especially of the heart and lunrrs.
In pulmonic inflammation his treatment is more enercretic than that
generally adopted, and appears to be attended with rrre~ success· the
progress of the dise.ase being effectually arreste? .at the~utset, his pa;ients
mostly recover w1thout the subsequent debrhty and tedious conva-
lescence consequent upon less decisive practice.
According to the published report, twenty-six cases of pleuro-pneu-
monia were adr~itted during the clinical course of five months; most of
them. on .the thrrd or fourtl_1 day from the commencement of the attack,
and m different stages of drseases. The treatment consisted in repeated
venesection, while at the same time blood was abstracted by cupping or
leeches from the thorax. On an average each patient was bled four
PARISIAN HOSPITALS. 37
times, cupped twice, and had twenty-four leeches applied ; in about
half the number of cases blisters were also employed ; and in one case
a p~rgative was given. Of these patients two only died, twenty-three
havmg been cured before the fourteenth day.
Articular rheumatism is treated by M. Bouillaud by general and local
abstraction of blood, Dover's powder, opiates, either given internally or
by the endermic method, blisters, mercurial frictions, and compression,
employed according to circumstances. The pericardia] inflammation su
frequently accompanying rheumatism, is not regarded by M. Bouillaud
as a metastatic affection, but as an essential part of the disease ; he is of
opinion that in most cases of acute rheumatism, auscultation will furnish
evidence of disordered action of the heart from this cause ; the pericar-
dium being somewhat analogous in structure and function with synovial
membranes, is liable to be similarly affected by disease.
lVI. Bouilbud considers typhoid fevers to depend on an inflammatory
condition of the intestinal canal, combined with a vitiated state of the
blood and secretions, and consequently treats them as other inflammatory
diseases, by repeated venesections, and cupping or leeching the abdo-
men ; the chloruret of sodium being in many cases at the same time
administered in the patient's potion, as well as in lavements and baths.
These, with sweetened or acidulated diluents, and occasionally blisters
to the extremities, are the means principally relied upon. This treat-
ment is said to be very successfuI. Of this I had not sufficient oppor-
tunity of judging, as one successful case which I saw during my visits
occurred in a female of strong constitution, in whom no dangerous
symptom existed.
In another case, which I suhjoin, where the typhoid symptoms were
more strongly marked, it failed altogether : the patient becoming pro-
gressively worse from the time of his admission.
Typhus fever.-A man aged twenty-two, admitted 29th :March, was taken ill
nine days before with shivering, great debility, and headache. He was then bled,
pnrged, and took an emetic without relief, and on the 30th presented the following
symptoms: great prostration of strength,•pulse 100, small, and easily compressed,
lips dry, tongue red at the tip and edges, brownish in the centre, temperature of the
skin no higher than natural; part of the body, and more especially the abdomen,
covered w1th red spots; tension of the abdomen, but no pain, nor tenderness on
pressure; bowels constipated. He answers questions clearly, though not at all
times very readily.-Venesection to twelve ounces, abstraction of eight ounces of
blood by cupping on the abdomen; emollient lavement, potion with syrup of gum.
31st. He says he is worse, but dot·s not complain of pain; pulse 100, small and
weak, eruption less vivid, abdomen ty:•.panitic, constipation, dull sound on per-
cussion at the lower and posterior part of the thorax.-Abstraction of eight ounces
of blood by cupping; potion with chloruret of sodium; lavement with chloruret;
chlorine fumigations and aspersions.
April Ist. He complains of being worse than yesterday, and of excessive debility.
Pulse 124, feeble, breath fetid, inability to pass his urine, which is drawn off-bath
with chloruret; other remedies continued.

5th. The patient died early this morning. On examining th~ body, e~tensl
intestinal lesions were observed, especially about the inferior portwn of the Ileum.
lVI. Rayer, known to the profession in Eng;land by his tal~nted w?rk
on cutaneous diseases, is also one of the physicians of th~s ho~pital.
Although adopting in some measure the opinions of Brouss~rs.' hers not
exclusively guided by them in his treatment of disease, and Is.m general
very successful in his practi<'e. His wards usually contam several
interestinrr cases of cutaneous disease ; he has also the charge of out-
patients \~ith these diseases, which he treats hy internal. medi.cines,
combined with tepid or medicated baths. Among the patients ~n the
hospital at the period of my attendance, was a man in whom, wtth~ut
any assignable cause, the colour of the skin had changed to a blaclush
hue; his health was not materially affected.
M. Rayer has seen two or three similar cases, and I believe terms
the disease Nigritia in his work. The discoloration, like that produc~d
by the nitrate of silver, is permanent, its causes are enveloped m
obscurity.

LA PITIE.
THE hospital of J{otre Dame de !a Pitie occupies a considerahle
space of ground in an open part of the town near the Jardin des
Plantes. The different portions of the building enclose courts laid
out as a garden, for the use of patients able to walk about. The wards
are smaller than those of La Charite, but are airy and extremely clean.
There are five physicians and two surgeons attached to this hospital.
The number of beds is about six hundred.
The names of two of the physicians, MlVI. Louis and Andral are
well known to the profession in Britain, as those of two of the ~ost
distinguished pathologists in Europe. l\1. Louis is minute in his ex-
amination of patients, and pays great attention to the sirrns furnished by
au~cult~ti?n and percussion : his diagnosis is generaJly very correct.
H1s opmwns are opp~sed to those of the ~roussaists, especially as
regar~s fevers. I? h1s treatment of acute disease, h.e.does not carry

getic. antiphlogistic measures, but treats the disease by diluents and
laxatn:es, the ~eltzer water being the aperient which he prefers.
~s Illustratmg the treatment, I add the following case, which occurred
dunng my attendance.
P!euro-pneumonia.-The patient was a boy, aged sixteen, who had formerly had
attacks. of pleurisy: six· days before admission he was seized with fever, pain
extendmg- all over the left side of the thorax, cough, and dyspnrea: these symptoms
went on Increasing in intensity till the period of his reception on the 22d of April.
On the 23d, in addition to the above-mentioned, he presented the following symp-
toms,-pulse quick but compressible, expectoration of puriform matter, on rirrht
side of thorax respiration more audible than natural, on left side bronchophony ~nd
diffused rt:ile crepitant beneath the scapula, dull sound on percussion of the inferior
and posterior part of the same side.-Bleeding to sixteen ounces; tisane.
24th. Ten ounces more blood were abstracted last evening, and he feels better;
the dyspnrea is less oppressive, and expectoration more free; skin of natural
temperature; pulse 130, soft; inspiration forty times in a minute; mucous rale
extensively diffused on the posterior part of left side of the thorax. (Bleeding to
twelve ounces; a potion containing tartarized antimony and syrup of gum.)
25th. The blood huffy and coagulum firm; less dyspnrea, but percussion still
yields the son mat; tongue white, bowels relaxed.-Potion with eight grains of
tartarized antimony.
27th. Countenance sunk, lips dry, pulse quick and weak; bowels relaxed,
intellect somewhat obtuse. Decoction of rice sweetened; aromatic potion with
twelve grains of tartarized antimony; and an ounce of syrup of poppies; Burgundy
pitch plaster on left side of thorax. These measures procured no advantages, and
he died on the 28th.
Examination. Extensive adhesion of pleura with false membrane on left side of
thorax; inferior lobe of left lung hepatized; on right side universal pleuritic
adhesion from previous attacks.
I shall not enter into a statement of l\I. Andral's opinions and mode
of treating diseases, as having already been published in English, a
knowledge of them is pretty extensively diffused among the profession.
lVI. Andral has of late used saline purgatives in typhoid fevers with
great advantage: he pointed out to me several convalescents who had
been treated by this means. Since he has adopted this mode of treat-
ment, he has not had sufficient opportunities of ascertaining whether
intestinal lesions are less frequent in those who die than in patients
treated by other methods.
The surgeons of La Pitie are lVI. Lisfranc and lVL Blandin, the latter
having lately succeeded M. Velpeau, who was transferred to LaCharite
in the room of 1\l. Roux. l\L Lisfranc is well known by the numerous
improvements he effected in operative surgery; but of late years has
endeavoured to avoid occasions for operating by the early adoption of
constitutional measures, though his employment of these measures falls
far short of the English practice in surgical disease. As l\1. Lisfranc
docs not, like many continental practitioners, adopt exclusive and
invariable methods of treatment in particular diseases, but is a\vare that
the same disease requires different and sometimes opposite measures in
different individuals, and even in the same individual, at different times,
his practice varies according to the condition of the patient and to
existing circumstances, and appears to me to be attended with great
success.
40 PARISIAN HOSPITALS.
1\-I. Lisfranc has charge of two men's and a ·women's wards, most of
the cases in the latter being marked as disease of the uterus;. many. of
these patients are however young women affecterl with superficial ero~wn
of the cervix uteri, and are cured by a few days' rest and. appropn~te
treatment; the means resorterl to in these cases, as well as m ulceratiOn
of this part, being chiefly confinement to the recumbent position, o~ca­
sional venesection to three or four ounces, on the principle of revulsiOn,
small doses of cicuta, and cauterization with a solution of mercury in
nitric acid every six or eight days: when the ulceration is of a cancerous
nature and too deep to be removed hy cauterization, l\L Lisfranc has
recourse to excision of the cervix uteri, this part hein~ exposed by the
speculum, and firmly seized by pinces de meseaux, is brought down
beyond the orifice of the vagina and excised with a knife, as in cases of
polypus. M. Lisfranc has not met with more than four or five cases of
dangerous hremorrhage after this ope1·ation, the symptoms which super-
vene being mostly of a nervous character and sometimes alarming,
but mostly yield to serlatives. Of ninety-nine cases in which he operated,
eighty-four recovered : many of these patients became subsequently
pregnant, and experienced no particul~r inconvenience in parturition.
There is little doubt, however, that amputation has been performed in
many cases where it might have been avoiderl, and the operation is now
much less frequent than a few years ::tgo, as accorrling to l\'1. Lisfranc,
patients with these diseases apply at a much earlier periorl for relief, and
consequently many cases are cured by the employment of other means.
In one of the female patients phlebitis supervened on bleeding from
the arm, and was treated by emollient fomentation and cataplasm on the
inflamed part, with the repeated application of leeches between the
point where the inflammation terminated and the heart. l\1. Lisfranc
sta~es that since. he. has adopted this practice he. has not lost a single
pattent from thts dtsea~e, whereas when he was In the habit of using
other means, and applymg leeches near the wound or over the inflamed
vein, the majority of cases term inaled unfavoul'ably. His treatment of
chronic anrl psoas. abs~ess is als? different from that usually adopted :

ST. LOUIS.
THis hospital occupies more space than any other in Paris, and is
second only to the Hotel Dieu in the number of beds, which amounts
to seven hundred. One hundred and eighty of these are occupied by
surgical cases, most of the rest by cutaneous and scrofulous affections ;
numerous out-patients also receive daily the benefit of the physicians'
consultation, and of the warm, vapour, and medicated baths which
exists in this hospital on a large scale, though at present not in the best
order.
1\'f. Albert and 1\'I. Biett are the physicians to whom the care of
patients with cutaneous disease is ~mostly confided : those, however,
affected with psora are placed in wards separate from the rest, under the
care of 1\1. Emery.
l\1. Alibert is principally known to the English profession by his
large work on cutaneous diseases, in the treatment of which he employs
lotions and other external applications more generally than l\I. Biett,
who trusts chiefly to internal remedies and baths, seldom employing
other outward applications. J.VI. Biett is not biassed in favour of any
particular remedy ; his treatment is directed upon general principles,
according to existing indications. The following are his opinions with
respect to the use of baths in cutaneous diseases.
Simple tepid baths are most beneficial in the dry scaly forms, though
only as an accessory means; their efficacy is less marked in the pustular
varieties : they are serviceable in vesicular affections when the inflam-
mation begins to decrease, and may be used with advantage in im-
petiginous affections where incrustations have succeeded to the pustules.
Alkaline baths are efficacious in the papular and dry scaly forms, and
in the impetiginous and tubercular varieties. An alkaline bath may be
formed by dissolving in a simple bath from half a pound to a pound of
carbonate of soda.
Sulphur baths are most useful in the decline of vesicular affections :
they are less useful than alkaline baths in the chronic stage of psora,
and if used in the inflammatory stage the symptoms are aggravated.
Sulphurous baths are composed of two ounces of diluted sulphuric acid
and eight ounces of hydro-sulphuret of potass added to each bath.
42 PARISIAN HOSPITALS.
Acid baths may be made by adding to each from four to eight ounces
of hydro-chloric acid ; they are mostly applicable in dry scaly erup-
tions.
l\J. Biett's opinions and practice on cuta!leous diseases are fully ex-
posed in his lectures; an epitome of which has been published by two
of his pupils.
l\1. Lugol has charge of the scrofulous patients. !Jis method of
treatincr these affections by iodine and ioduretted baths IS pretty exten-
sively known since the publication of his lliemoires on the subject. In
the course of his practice, M. Lugol has ne\·er seen atro~hy of healthy
glandular structure, nor other injurious consequences which have been
attributed to the use of iodine.
I I
HOPTTAL DES VENERIENS.
THIS large establishment, exclusively appropriated to the reception
of syphilitic patients of both sexes, is situate in a healthy locality at
the southern extremity of the city, and contains six hundred beds. The
wards are large, but are neither so clean nor so well ventilated as in
other hospitals, and the beds are placed too closely to each other, the
house being too small for the number of patients. The more severe
cases, however, and those patients whose general health is materially
affected are placed in smaller and more airy wards on the first floor.
Numerous out-patients also receive advice and medicine daily. Three
surgeons, l\IM. Cullerier, Ricord, and 1\Ianec, are attached to this
hospital.
l\I. Cullerieris inclined to doubt that syphilitic affections are produced
by a specific virus, but he admits that morbid secretions act as a cause
of irritation, and determine on healthy parts with which they come into
contact, inflammation of various kinds, giving rise in its turn to secre-
tions which may also act as irritants. He consequently does not use
mercury as a specific remedy, although in many cases he avails himself
of this remedy, but its exhibition is never carried so far as to induce
copious salivation. \Vhen deemed necessary, it is either introduced
into the system by means of friction, or exhibited internally in combi-
nation with iodine. ,

when combmed with affection of the bones, or cutaneous eruption he
e~plo~s th~ tisane d~ Feltz wi.th great advantage. The chief ingre-
dients m this preparation are antimony and sarsaparilla.
Blenorrhagia is treated by general and local abstraction of blood
baths, local and general, abstinence, and diluents ; when the inflam~
PARISIAN HOSPlTALS. 43
matory stage has passed, copaiba or cubebs are given, injections being
seldom resorted to except in uterine and vaginal discharge. In leucor-
rhcea,and othe1·chronic cases, M. Cullerier has lately employed cauteriz-
ation of the os tincre with nitrate of silver or a solution of mercury in
nitrous ar.id, applied by means of the speculum; injections of a solution
of acetate of lead being subsequently used. This practice has also
recently been adoptee} by M. Ricord in vaginal discharges of a more
acute nature ·with great success ; a piece of lunar caustic being introduced
so as to come in contact with the parietes of the vagina.
1\'L Ricord employs cauterization in most primary ulcers of the
genitals when not accompanied with a high degree of inflammation; he
has not seen bubo produced by this method, and even its existence does
not counter-indicate the usc of the caustic. In irritable and phageclenic
sores, a solution of opium is the most usual dressing. He prescribes
mercury more frequently than M. Cullerier, either in frictions or the
internal use of the proto-ioduret, in the dose of from one to three grains
daily, having found that this remedy is more efficacious when combined
with iodine. Inflamm1tion of the inguinal glands are treated by anti-
phlogistic measures,-in the more chronic state by blisters; as soon as
the existence of matter is ascertained an opening is made to allow of
escape.
The treatment of blenorrhagia resembles that above mentioned ;
where much pain and chordee exist pills of camphor and opium are
ordered to be taken every night. In chronic urethral discharge astrin-
gent injections are frequently used, it being l\L Ricard's opinion, that
they neither produce stril"!turc nor enlargement of the follicular glands
of the urethra, such affections occurring most frequently from the
neglect of employing proper measures at the commencement. M.
Ricord is also of opinion that eruptions and other secondary affections
are never produced by gonorrhcea, but that in these cases an ulcer within
the orifice of the urethra or elsewhere co-exists with the discharge, and
i:; mostly· overlooked unless minute examination be made. Even when
it cannot be seen, the existence of ulceration within the urethra is often
evidenced by induration of the part.
HOPITAL DES ENFANS MALADES,
THIS hospital, with its court-yards and gardens, occupies a considerable
sp:-~ce in the salubrious part of the suburbs, and is exclusively appro-
priated to the relief of sick children, from the age of two to fifteen.
Five hundred patients can be accommodated, though in general not
more than half this number of beds is occupied. The majority is
composed of medical cases, the number of surgical patients being but
small : scrofulous patients and those with cutaneous disease are treated
in wards separate from the rest. The medical duties are performed by
four physicians and a surgeon ; two of the physicians have charge of
44 PARISIAN HOSPITALS.
the acute diseases, the other two of the chronic cases. At the end of
every six months they change places, the physicians who. have pr~­
viously had the patients with acute disease undertake those With chrome
affection, and vice versu.
The mortality at this hospital is very great, particul~rly amon~ the
younger patients, the proportion of deaths to the admissiOnS bemg as
one to four ; in acute diseases about one third, and in small-pox one
half of the patients die. .
There is nothing in the position of the buildin?; to account for this
great mortality, which in my opinion is to be ascribed to .the compara-
tively inert practice pursued. Except in cases where active measures
are strongly indicated, the treatment of diseases here? a:" well .as ~t the
Enfans trouves, is for the most part expectant, consistmg prmc1pally
of diluents, solution of various syrups, baths, lavements, \Vith occasional
counter-irritants. Sanguineous depletion is comparatively infrequent,
and laxatives, diaphoretics, sedatives, &c., but seldom resorted to.
At the period of my visits l\II. Baudeloque had the treatment of the
acute cases, and M. Guersent of the scrofulous patients. l\1. Baudeloque
speaks highly of the efficacy of sulphur baths in the treatment of chorea,
this remedy often succeeding after the failure of other means. The
proportion of girls affected by this disease is very much larger than
that of boys, and it is found to affect the left side more frequently than
the right; post-mortem inspections throw no light on its nature. l\1.
Baudeloque has not observed that the disease is ever propagated by
imitation among children placed in the same ward.
The patients with scrofula are placed in low ill-ventilated wards,
little likely to ameliorate their health. In the treatment of these
affections M. Guersent employs tonics, iodine, and ioduretted baths,
from which much benefit is often derived. He states, ho,vever, that
in the summer months numerous patients are cured or materially
relieved whatever remedies are employed, whereas, in the winter the
dis~ase is more intractable, either making progress, or at best remai~ing
statwnary.

a small quantity of opium is sometimes added. In the more chronic
stages, blisters and the tartarized antimony ointment are generally re-
sorted to. In continued fever, l\I. Bricheteau does not in general
recommend sangnineous depletion, but relies principally upon saline
purgatiYes, and states that this method of treatment is very successful.
He also speaks highly of the advantages of compression in ascites, both
before and after pnraceutesis; the compression is made by means of a
broad bandage laced in the manner of a corset, which is worn as tightly
as it can be borne without inconvenience; other measures, as occasional
purgatives, diuretics, &c. are at the same time employed. Some other
Parisian physicians also employ this method in the treatment of drop-
sical effusions. A small ward in the hospital has been allotted to l\1.
Civiale, for the reception of patients about to undergo the operation of
lithotrity. At the time of my visit, however, there was but one patient
with calculus, on whom l\1. Civiale operated with his usual dexterity,
most of the other beds being occupied with stricture cases.
Paralysis of the bladder, and vesical catarrh, in elderly people are
treated in the followin~ manner:-a stream of cold water flows from a
reservoir fixed nea1· the ceiling, through an elastic gum tube, having
stop-cocks, and terminating .in a silver catheter formed into a double
tube by a central partition. The patient being in the recumbent posi-
tion and the catheter introduced, the water passes into the bladder by
one side and out by the other. A continu.ed stream of water through the
bladder is thus kept up for about ten minutes, and repeated every se-
concl or th~rd day: the quantity of water passing into the bladder may
be re~ulated by the stop-cock, so as to prevent undue distension. The
beneficial effects of the method are attributed to the clearing away of
the accumulated mucus, and to the tonic action of the cold \Vater upon
the bladder.
HOPITAL COCHIN.
Tnrs neat little ho<:pital was founded by the ecclesiastic, whose name
it bears. It contains one hundred beds; the wards are airy and very
clean, and the class of cases received mostly consist of acute diseases
and accidents. The professional attendants are two physicians, and a
surgeon l\I. Robert, who enjoys a well-merited reputation, both as a
judicious practitioner and a skilful operator.
During one of my visits I was present at the post·mortem examina-
tion of a man on whom a mass of stone had fallen, and produced frac-
ture of several of the ribs, with dislocation of the thigh; the head of the
bone resting between the inferior margin of the acetabulum and the
tuberosity of the ischium. On admission, the symptoms resembled
those of dislocation into the ischiatic notch; reduction was effected
tnrenty-four hours after the accident, and the patient survived twelve
5
46 PARISIAN HOSPITALS.
days, his death being caused by the violence of the thoracic inflammation.
On inspection, there was considerable ecchymosis in the muscles sur-
rounding the articulation: the psoas and iliacus internus were much
injured, some fibres being lacerated, and the superior portion of the
quadratus femoris was torn through: in the posterior part of the capsu-
lar ligament, a rent existed sufficiently large to allow the head of the
bone to pass through, and the ligamentum teres was ruptured. The
position occupied by the head of the bone was indicated by the contused
appearance of the muscular fibres and increased ecchymosis; the parts
in the immediate neighbourhood of the ischiatic notch were in a nor-
mal condition.

PART II.
ITALlAN :l\fEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.
TuE medical institutions of Italy are regulated much in the same
manner as in France, being under the superintendence of their respec-
tive governments, and deriving their revenues from property with which
they have been endowed, and from the bequests and donations of rich
individuals. In most of the hospitals a rlirector is invested with supreme
power, and the election of medical officers is mostly decided by con-
cours. Those officially connected with the medical establishments
receive salaries; medical visits are made daily <"It an early hour. The
patients are usually admitted on application, and are attended by a
religious sisterhood, with subordinate male and female attendants; the
bodies of those who die are examined, and supply the dissecting rooms,
although the Italians are not in general very zealous in the cultivation
of either natural or morbid anatomy.
The profession is divided as in France, into physicians, surgeons, and
obstetric practitioners. The division between medicine and surgery is
in some parts very arbitrary, the duties of the surgeon being confined
to the application of local remedies, and operations, while the physician
is called in to prescribe for the constitutional disorder accompanying
suq!;ical disease.
The principles by which the practice is guided, necessarily vary in
the different states: at Florence and Rome they are based upon the
Broussaian doctrine much more generally than at Naples or :Milan ; hut
with the exception of the last city, the treatment of disease is infinitely
inferior to the French. The number of followers of the Rasorian doc-
trine of contra-stimulus has very much diminished of late years, and
the practice of giYing large doses of antimony to supersede blood-letting
in acute disease is comparatively rarely employed. The abstraction of
blood from the system in small quantity at a time, is a mode pretty
generally adopted, as are also blistering, baths, and lavements; sedatives
are likewise frequently prescribed, but purgatives, tonics, and stimulants,
arc more sparingly used.
The Italians do not speedily adopt innovations, and auscultation,
percussion, and lithotrity meet with no advocates among them. In
surgical cases little or no medicine is given; patients who die after
accidents and operation, usually succumb to constitutional irritation or
intemal inflammations; hospital gangrene is also a frequent cause of
death in some parts. The greater temperance of the Italians, ho"·ever,
and the purer air of their cities, render them Jess liable to se,·ere
inflammatory attacks and derangement of the general health, which so
frequently supervene in surgical cases in England,
48 ITALlAN MEDICAL INSTITU'l'IONS.
MILAN.
THIS city has a population of a hundred and twenty thousand in~b~­
tants, and contains three principal hospitals. The Spedale Gran e lS
one of the laro-est hospitals in Europe, enclosing a large central court-
yard and four ~maller courts ; its fa~adc is ha~Hlsome, a~d measures
several hundred feet in length. 1\Iost of the articles used rn the estab-
lishment, as bread, bedding, blankets, clothing, &c. are manufactured
within the walls. Two thousand beds can be made up ; the number of
patients varies, however, with the season. At the period of my l.ast
visit, 1\Iay, it amounted to sixteen hundred. Out-patients also receive
advice and medicine on application. The wards are for the most p~rl
laro-e hio-h and airv : in some of them a double row of beds occupies
O' O' • • h •• l
the centre, besides those ranged along the walls. Eight p ~rsieJahns anc
four surgeons, besides assistants, internes, &c. are charged w1th t e pro-
fessional duties; some of the~;e visit their patients twice a day. Illness
and poverty are the only testimonial~; required for the admis~ioi~ of
patients. Those who prefer it can be visited at their own habitations
by professional men, the medicine being sent from the hospital. There
are also some small wards appropriated to those who contribute some-
what towards their own maintainance.
The irrigation of the plains of Lombardy and the cultivation of the
rice-fields with which the 1\Iilanese abounds, are fertile sources of fevers
of all types, which with thoracic and tracheal inflammation, phthisis,
and rheumatism, form the prevailing acute diseases.
The treatment of disea~;e appears to me to be more rational at l\Iilan
than in other parts of Italy, being based less upon exclusive systems
than upon ohservation of symptoms, and the special indications in indi-
vidual cases. In inflammatory diseases bleeding is pretty freely em-
ployed at the outset, and internal medicines being at the same time given,
the necessity for its frequent repetition is obviated. Purgatives are also
used more freely in l\Iilan than elsewhere, especially in intermittents,
which are treated by abstpction of blood at the commencement, and
subsequently by quinine. Counter-irritation by blisters and antimonial
ointment is another mean resorted to as subordinate to bleedincr in inflam-
mation of the thoracic viscera and rheumatism. Calomel, squill dio-italis
and other remedies, almost proscribed in some parts, are he1~e u~ed ii~
appropriate cases.

the whole length of th~ hmb ; su.fficient extension, however, does not
appear to be kept up; 111 one which I measured a month after the acci-
dent, there was consicler~hle shorteni.ng.. Fractures of the leg are treated

supernumerary ligatures arc not entirely disr.arded : the ligatures are
~enerally composed of several threads joined together. Bronchocele
IS extremely prevalent near Milan ; it affects principally individuals
who reside in the valleys ncar Como and Bergamo, and is frequently
seen occupying, a great portion of the neck.
The disease, however, which may be considered as the endemic of
Lombardy is the pellagra, of which the hospitals of .Milan, Bologna,
and Parma, contain numerous specimens. This disease consists p:1rtly
in a chronic inflammation of the skin, more particularly affcctin~ those
parts which are usually exposed to the sun, as the neck, hands, and arms,
which become covered with a dark brown, scaly eruption : the epider-
mis cracks, and is separated in many places. There mostly exists, at
the same time, considerable derangement of the digesti,re organs and of
the nervous system, with hypochondriasis, and in some cases a pro-
pensity to suicide, or to destroy others, especially children. The disease
occurs mostly in spring and summer; many patients arc affected at this
period for several successive years, and become comparatively well as
autumn ad,·anccs. After repeated attacks it usually terminates either
in p:tralysis, visceral disorganiz:1tion, or mental alienation. The attack
occurs sometimes wi~hout precursory symptoms ; but in most cases it is
preceded by general indisposition, muscular and intellectual debility, and
headache.
Pclla~ra is confined to the poorest classes, who inhabit the country.
It mostly attacks persons somewhat advanced in life, women more
frequently than men, though children are not exempt. :Most of the
profession consider lYnrerty, want of proper food, and clothing, espe-
cially the usc of bread made with damaged Indian corn, to be its pre-
disposing causes-its exciting causes are enveloped in consirlerable
obscurity. I was informed, by one of the physicians, that it is more
prevalent among the inhabitants of the hills than those of the plain :
the patients generally become better on changing their residence and
mode of life. Various lesions are met with in autopsic examinations:
these arc, however, consecutiYe, and throw no light upon the nature of
the disease. The treatment consists in placing the patients in good air,
allowing proper nourishment, wine, &c., and in remedying urgent
symptoms by appropriate means.
The Obstetric and Foundling Hospital is not in general open to
Yisitors. Nearly three thousand infants are received annually: few,
however arc kept in the house, the greater number being p~t out to
nurse in the country.
The Ilospital for the Insane is situate about a mile from the town,
in a locality where considerable humidity must prevail, from the neigh-
bourhood of numerous canals for irrigation. It contains five hundred
beds ; the wards are clean and airy, being built round court-yards,
which serve for an exercise-ground. At the period of my visit there
were four hundred and twenty patients in the house ; the men being
in greater proportion, and all wearing a. similar kind of dress. The
more intmctable ones sleep in separate wards, but in the day-time are
allowed to walk about with the rest, the hands being fixed in thick

measures employed. The physician, who accompamed f!le? spe~ks
highly of the effects of the morphine in allaying cerebral. Irntability.
Several of the inmates have goitres, and a large proportiOn of them
had laboured under attacks of pel!i'lgra.
GENOA.
GENOA possesses one of the most variable climates in Italy. The
heat in summer is excessive~ and in winter rain and snow frequently
fall : while the hills encircling the town on the land side, are not
sufficiently high to shelter it from the north and east winds, which blow
with great force from the more distant snow·covered mountains. Hence
inflammations of the lungs and air-passages, phthisis, rheumatism, are
the most prevalent diseases. Gastric irritation is also extremely com-
mon in summer.
The principal hospital contains about fifteen hundred beds. Its
exterior presents nothing remarkable; but the staircases and corridors
are wide, handsome, and adorned with statues of individuals who have
been benefactors to the institution. The wards are large and lofty, but
the beds are placed too closely to each other. There is also a lying-in
ward, there being no obstetric hospital in the city. The number of
patients in the house usually averages from eight hundred to eight
hundred and fifty. The professional attendants are eight in number-
four physicians aud four surgeons. Visits are made twice in the day.
There is no operating theatre, operations being performed in the wards.
I did not see much of the practice, but believe it to be very inferior.
The Hospital of Incurables contains eight hundred beds : most of
these are occupied by old people with chronic disease. Part of the
building is appropriated to the reception of insane patients. The number
of these is about t\vo hundred and fifty. They are confined to ill-
ventilat~d ~vards, which ~hey are never all.o\~ed to leave until they die,
or are dismissed the hospital. All the vanet1es of insanity are concrre-
g:ated together, the only difference. being, that the quiete.r patients

occasional depletion, very little treatment appears to be adopted.
ITALlAN MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 51
It is said the physicians are anxious to effect an amendment of this
state of matters, but their wishes are not seconded by the government.
I was not allowed to see the women's ward, but 1\L Briere de Boismont,
a Parisian physician, who has published a small pamphlet on the
establishments for the insane in Italy, was more fortunate; he says-
"The women are shut up in two dirty and badly-lighted wards ; one of
them is large, cold, and damp. :Many of the patients are chained by
the hands and feet: their howlinf.!;s, their accessions of fury, and the
clanking of their chains, give to this horrible place the appearance of
the infernal regions." From the end of 18.28 to the end of 18.29, ninety
men and eighty-four women were admitted; forty men and thirty-two
women were dismissed, either cured, or in such a condition as not to
disturb the public peace : thirty-1\vo men, and the same number of
women, died. This proportion of deaths, compared with the number
.of inmates, is enormous.
TURIN.
THE establishment at Turin was, a few years ago, according to the
account published by Dr. Clark, _very little better than that at Genoa.
A new and larger building has, however, been erected, and many
improvements effected in the management of the patients; though,
according to l\1. Briere de Boismont, chains are still affixed at night to
the more intractable patients. The indiscriminate employment of
bleeding and purgatives, every spring, as formerly adopted, is now
discontinued. The remedial means mostly re~orted to, where great
cerebral excitement exists, are general and local blood-letting, purgatives,
the tepid and shower baths, the application of iced cloths to the head,
and in some cases opium.
There is a darkened chamber in which noisy patients are sometimes
put, without confinement' of the limbs ; the darkness and solitude often
succeed in quieting them after the fa~lure of other means. l\l. Briere
de Boismont states that insanity is on the increase in Piemont, and that
more instances from political causes have been latterly observed. The
cases depending upon these causes are, ho,vever, few, when compared
to those arising from ambition, vanity, love, and religious enthusiasm.
PARi\IA.
\YITII a population of thirty-five thousand inhabitants, Parma contains
a general hospital, a lying-in and foundling hospital, one for the insane,
an university, and several charitable institutions. Among these is a
52 ITAUAN MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.
society for furnishing poor persons with relief and medical attenda?ce
at their own houses, termed the Congrega=ione pietosa della Cantu,
which was established in the fifteenth century: one half of the members
arc nobles and citizens,-the other half ecclesiastics. Two mcmb.ers
are attached in rotation to each district of the town and surrounchng
' '
country, whose duty it is to seck out and relieve those who. are proper
objects for the assistance of the charity. Several profesflwnal men,
elected every three years, attend to the sick and recei ,·e ~ salary. T~e
affairs of the society are managed by tweh·e members~six secular, ~IX
ecclesiastic-who are divided into pairs, each pair having the superin-
tendence of a particular department.
The Spedale della Jlfisericordia has a plain exterior, but the
principal wards arc handsome, lofty, extremely clean, and airy. The
clinical wards, and those for the military, are small, and not so well
ventilated as the others. The hospital contains four hundred beds, but
in May, 1834, not more than half these were occupied. There arc
four physicians and two surgeonfl. Raflori and Tommassini, the origin-
ators of the contra-stimulant theory, are professors of clinical medicine.
This doctrine supposes that life is the result of two forces, Yiz. sti-
mulus, or excess of action ; and contra-stimulus, or debility. These
opposing forces, in a healthy state of the system, counterbalance and
maintain each other in a state of equilibrium ; but when one or the
other preponderates, the healthy condition is destroyed, and disorder
ensues. Hence the supporters of this system admit only of two orders
of diseases,-those from excessive excitement, and those from debility.
This last condition is not considered merely as a negative state, or
absence of stimulus, as in the Brunonian doctrine ; but is regarded as
the product of an active power, independently of the opposing force.
Remedies are also divided into stimulant and contra-fltimulant : amon(J'
1":'
the former may be enumerated tonics, opium, spirituous preparation~ :
the latter include all agents which tend to lower Yascular action: of
these antimony, was most frequently had recourse to, and was exhibited
in very large doses, being in many cases made to supersede sano-uincous
depletion. This practice counted, a few years ago, numerous fgllowers
but is now made accessary to the other measures, and bleedino- is car~
ried to a greater extent in Parma than in most parts of Italy.

posed of a dean. and thirteen professorships. A few years ago, Caldani
was professor of anatomy, B1·era of clinical medicine, Ruggieri of sur-
gery and pathology.
PAVIA.
THE university of Pavia, also in the Lombard Venetian territories,
is next in importance to that of Padua, and in consequence of the fame
of Scarpa is much resorted to. Two kinds of degrees are conferred
by these universities, viz. that of doctor in medicine or surgery, and
that of maslcr in surgery, or minor surgeon, being equivalent to the
o.fficiers de sante in France. Five years' study is required for the
dei-!;ree of doctor,-four years for the degree of master in surgery. Ana-
tomy is more assiduously cultivated at Pavia, under the auspices of
Professor Panizza, than elsewhere in Italy. The museum contains a
fine collection of anatomic:J.l preparations. Clinical lectures, as at Parma,
are delivered in the hospitals.
~I. Roux, from }Vhom this account is taken-as I have not visited
Pavia-state~ that medical men are liable to be cited before the tribunals
for ig:norance or inattention : those in whom the charge of ignorance
is substantiated are again obliged to attend the medical classes for a
certain period, and to undergo a fresh examination.
BOLOGNA.
THE population of Bologna amounts to seventy thousand souls.
There are three hospitals and an university. The Spedale della Vita
contains about two hundred beds. The wards are airy and clean, and
the service performed with care and regularity. It is appropriated to
the reception of acute diseases and accidents. The professional duties
are performed by two physicians and two surgeons, who give clinical
lectures to the students of the university. Tommassini was formerly
professor of clinical medicine, and the contra-stimulus doctrine is still
a good deal followed in the treatment of disease. The acute diseases
most prevalent at Bologna, are inflammatory and intermitting fevers,
inflammation of the lungs, bronchitis, and rheumatism. Pellagra is
also common, both about Bologna and Parma ; less so, however, than
nearer .:\Iilan.
The Spedale St. Orsola receives patients with chronic, syphilitic,
and cutaneous diseases. There is also a department for the insane,
about one hundred in number, who are lodged in four long corridors,
54 ITALlAN MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.
separate from the rest of the hospital, and warmed by stoves in wint~r.
The division for either sex contains a ward of about fifteen ~c s,
twenty-eight cells, and a small ward for convalescents. The P?tiCnts
appea1· to be treated with gentleness. Contra-stimulant remedies are
mostly employed, and the more violent patients arc treated. by low
diet, confinement by the straight waistcoat, the cold, and surpnse bath.
There is also a small well-arranrred, clinical hospital, of about fifty
' ~ . t
beds, adjoining the university, where the most intcrcst1.ng cases are s~n
for the instruction of pupils. At each bed a paper IS placed, stat111g
the circumstances connected with the case. Two or three rooms are
set apart for those persons who pay something towards their own
maintainance.
The university is a handsome edifice, inclosing a spacious co~rt-yard,
and containing a fine library ; an amphitheatre for the delivery of
lectures; museums of antiquities, of comparative anatomy, of natural
history, and of human and patholorrical anatomy. In this last are several
wax models of healthy and diseas~d structure. Those illustrating the
pellagra, and morbus ceruleus, are exceedingly \Veil executed. There
is also an interesting cabinet of casts, illustratinl!; the progress of utero-
gestation, anormal presentations, monstrosities, &c.
This university, formerly the most resorted to of any in Italy, is now
but thinly attended, the number of pupils being reduced to between
four and five hunch·ed, and most of the lectures are delivered at the
houses of the professors. Political circumstances are said to be the
causes of this change. Among the celebrated men who studied at
Bologna, are Valsalva, 1\Ialpighi, and Galvini, to whom a monument is
erected in one of the corridors.
l\Iedical students are obliged to attend the classes during four years,
in the following order ;-first year, natural history, botany, chemistry,
anatomy; second year, anatomy, physiology, comparative anatomy,
institutes of surgery ; third year, pathology, clinical medicine, materia
medica, chemistry; fourth year, pathology, clinical medicine, medical
jurispmdence, and midwifery. During the last year of study, a certain
number of patients are placed unrlcr the care of each pupil who,
previous to his examination, has to give an account of the cases, 'and of
the treatment he has adopted. Surgical students attend during the first
an~l second yea~·s the same courses. or lectures as the medical pupils;
th1rd year, mst1tutes of surgery, clmical surgery, anatomv aud dissec-
tions; fourth year, medical jurisprudenc.e, 1~1iclwifery,disse~tions,clinical
surgery, and the performance of operations on patients under the
guidance of the professor. At the termination of the first y'ear, students
take the degree of bachelor; at the end of the second year, of licenciate;
anrl at the end of the ~our.th year, of .doctor. of medicine or surgery.
The ~ode of exammatwn of canc!Idates 1s ~s follows : five professors
of the d1~erent hra~ches of educatw~ subm1t each to the candidate
twe~1ty d1fferent subjects, taken from J:lis own_course of instruction: the
pup1l dr~ws 01~e of th:se by lot, ancl1s ~xam1ned on that subject. Thus
the candidate 1s exammed on five subjects connected with medicine.
ITALlAN MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 55
\Vhen the examination is finished, each of the professors gives his vote
separately, as to the fitness of the candidates ; those who are considered
not sufficiently qualified, have to study during another year.
FLORENCE.
FLoRENCE, situated in a plain surrounded by the Appenines, has a
population of eighty thousand persons, and contains four hospitals;
these are placed under the direction of a superintendent, appointed by
the grand duke. The Spedale Santa JJ!faria Nuova, for the reception
of accidents, acute and chronic diseases, is a handsOme edifice, and
contains nearly one thousand Leds; the bedsteads are made of iron and
have curtains. In some wards the beds are too closely placed together
to allow a free circulation of air, but in general the wards are clean,
lofty, and well ventilated. A paper, stating the material circumstances
and daily progress of each case, is placed at the head of the bed. Patients
are admitted on application, and are attended upon by "sreurs de b
charite." The bodies of those who die are invariably examined, and
supply the dissecting room. There are two commodious operating
theatres adjoining the surgical wards, one on the ground floor, the other
on the first floor; a theatre for the delivery of anatomical and other
lectures ; a dissecting room, and a cabinet of pathological anatomy.
Separate wards are appropriated to syphilitic patients, and patients
afflicted with diseases of the eyes are placed in a darkened ward ; a
ward is also set apart for those patients who contribute towards their
own maintainance, from three to five pauls a day.
Two professors of medical clinique, two of surgical clinique, and
several assistant physicians and surgeons, who receive salaries, are
attached to the service of this hospital. One half of these attendants
do duty for six months in the year, at the expiration of which period
they are replaced by the other half. The surgical visit takes place at
eight o'clock every morning, and the medical visit at ten ; the professors
hold clinical dis~ourses with pupils at the bedside of patients.
The lectures of the Faculties of .1\Iedicine and Surgery are delivered
in this hospital, on the different branches of medical education; the
examination of candidates for the diploma of medicine or surgery
takes place before the members of the colleges. lVIedical candidates
are previously obliged to take their degree at the university of Pisa.
The Spedale di Bomfacio is divided into two parts, one for insane
patients, and the other for military patients~ and those afflicted with
incurable diseases. The hospital contains about eight hundred beds:
the wards are spacious, airy, and particularly clean.
The a\·erage number of insane in the hospital is from two hundred
and eighty to three hundred: males are in greater proportion than
females. Small cells, having each a window with iron bars, and con-
56 ITALIAN MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.
taining a bed, are situate on either side of p:tssages about. fifty feet in
length ; each patient has a separate cell, but in the da~· ttme they \l.rc
indiscriminately allo\ved to walk about the passages, ot In the ope~ air.
The patients are all clothed alike, in a white woollen dress. New P.ati~~ts
arc kept in separate rooms for a few days. in order that th.e p~cuha~Ities
of their insanity may be observed. The greatc:.st attentwn IS paal to
cleflnliness throughout the establishment.
When confinement of the hands is necessary,a wooden case (manclwt)
is used, into which both hands are placed, and kept bou?d to tl~e abdo-
men by means of a strap passing round the wrtist. Funous patients are
confined to a small darkened room, with well-padded walls ; the darkness
is found to render the greater number of such patients tractable. .The
treatment is conducted partly on moral principles; many of the patient~
are employed in mechanical occupations and gardening; the women. in
knitting, spinning, &c. The system formerly in use of employmg
depletory measures indiscriminately every summer, is now discontinued,
and bleeding is employed only when there exists great exaltation of
the cerebral functions.
The Spedale degl' Innocenti is a large building for the reception of
foundlings and of lying-in women. The number of infants annually
admitted amounts to fifteen hundred. These, with few exceptions, are
sent to be nursed in the country, and are supported by the establish-
ment till the age of ten years. The manner in which infants are bound
up in cloths in Italy, somewhat resembling an Egyptian mummy, is
the occasion of frequent distortions of the limbs, and is productive of
other bad effects. There is also at this hospital an obstetric school,
where lectures are given to females who purpose practising midwifery.
The ergot of rye is here given in those cases of protracted labour
depending upon deficient contraction of the uterus.
There is at Florence a fourth hospital, containing about forty beds,
for patients with acute and chronic diseases ; also a Casa dei Poveri, or
workhouse, on an extensive scale ; and obstetric institutions in different
parts of the city, for affording assistance at the habitations of poor
women.
The Societa della llfisericordia.-This charitable establishment was
instituted in the beginning of the fifteenth centurv, and counts amoncr
its mem.hers several of the nobility: its object is.to render assistanc~
to the siCk poor, for whom the members perform many kind offices,
and supply those who are treated at their own houses with necessaries
of a!~ kinds. Th.cy undert.ake the bu~·ial of the bodies of poor persons
and, In case of accident or disease, repair to the place where their :services
are required, and convey the patient to a hospital, or to their own
residence. The brethren meet in a building in the Piazza del Duomo
where the affi1irs of the society are conducted by a committee: one o:.
more of the committee is always in attendance at the central institution
to ind.icate to tho~e o~ duty the ]~lace where their services are required:
The Sicl~ ar~ earned 111 cov.ered litters, on the shoulders of the brethren,
\vho maint~m a yrofound silence, and are clothed from head to loot in a
black dommo, 111 order to conceal the persons of those who are thus
ITALIAI'. MEDICAt INSTITUTIONS. 57
enJ?;aged: ten, twelve, and sometimes more of the brethren, accompany
each litter, and frequently relieve each other in supporting the burden.
In the Museum of Natural History, perhaps the finest existing, is .
the splendid collection of anatomical wax models, coloured according
to nature, and exhibiting all the parts of the body, both conjointly and
in detail, of the natural size. A room is allotted to each division 01
anatomy, as osteolof!;y, myology, &c. In addition to the anatomical
models, are others illustratin~ the progress of utero-gestation, growth
of the fretus, &c. The models are in general pretty correct.
The most prevalent diseases at Florence 8re acute and subacute in-
flammation of the lungs, pleurisy, bronchial affections, dysentery, gastric
irritation, rheumatism, and diseases of the eyes.
The practice leans to the Bmussaian : all irritants aml tonics are
avoided; bleeding is very generally employed ; small quantitiesofblood,
as four, six, or eight ounces being abstracted at a time : consequently
the frequent repetition is necessary, \vhich has the effect, in many cases,
of debilitating the patient, without effectually arresting acute inflamma
tion. Hence one cause of the fatality attending acute inflammation o£
the lungs, known by the name of Mal di Petto, which so frequently
occurs from the variable temperature of Florence. Leeches are often
used, but not so generally l'esorted to as in France. Counter-irritation,
by means of the application of the ointment of tartarised antimony, is
frequently employed. Purgatives are seldom used, from a dread ol
their inducing gastro-enterite ; sedatives are not unfrequently em
ployed. Prussic acid, or the aqua Iauro cerasi, is sometimes given ·
in bronchial complaints. Intermittents are not of frequent occurrence;
they are treated by venesection when required, and by the exhibition
of the preparations of bark. In continued fever, small general bleedings
are employed; more frequently, however, the application of leeches to
the pit of the stomach, lemonade and cooling drinl{s are resorted to.
Rheumatism is treated by bleeding, warm bath, and diaphoretics :
the colchicum is not used ; its effects in this class of diseases do not
appear to be known.
In gastric and intestinal irritation, the application of leeches, and the
admiHistration of demulcent mixtures, are chiefly depended on. No
operation is performed without a previous consultation, at which the
~uperintendent of hospitals is present. All persons, professional or
not, are allowed to be present at operations, which are frequently per-
formed by the more advanced pupils, under the guidance of the pro-
fessor of surgery. Operations are in general pretty successful ; patients ·
are bled subsequent to their performance in most cases. The lateral
operation is performed for stone in the bladder; the bistoire cache is
generally used for incising, the neck of the bladder. Hydrocele is
treated by the operation of excision, the method by injection is ;~.dopted
·only in recent cases. The operation of couching is preferred in cata-
ract. Cases of strangulated hernia are' operated on immediately: no
other remedial means are employed, nor are many attempts made to
effect reduction by the taxis. Strictures of the urethra are treated by
confining the patient to bed, and passing an elastic gum catheter into

58 ITALIAN MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.
the bladder, the size being gradu:tlly increased : when a cathete_r cann~t
he introduced into the bladder, a catgut bou~ie is passed mto t e
nrethra as far as possible, and retained against the stricture for some
time: on withdrawing this, a catheter can generally be pas~ed.. Frac-
hires of the lower extremity are treated by placing the hmb In the
extended position: in fracture of the thigh, the limb is confined between
two long splints, connected ~ogether by a piece of cloth, P.assed under
the limb, and extending its whole len~th; the splints are twd together
by pieces of tape. By this mode sufficient extension is not kept up,
and shortening of the limb, more or less, is the consequence. Ophthal-
mia, whether acute, chronic, or strumous, is treated by general or local
depletion, warm emo11ient applications and fomentations ; the patients
being kept in a darkened room : stimulating collyria are scarcely ever
had recourse to, and blisters are not frequently used in the treatment of
diseases of the eyes. Under this treatment patients are long in recover-
ing, and, from the debilitated state in which the organ is left, suffer
frequent relapse.s after exposure to the ~harp winds so prevalent in
Florence. Inflammations of joints are treated by rest, local abstraction
of blood, and emollient cataplasms ; c~mnter-irrit~ttiun is seldom em-
ployed. It is generally a long while before recovery takes place.
Mercury, both used externa1ly and ~iven internaJiy, is chiefly trusted
to for the cure of syphilitic complaints ; its use, however, is not carried
so far as to induce copious salivation.
Union by the firs't intention is generally attempted after operations,
or recent wounds. Abscesses are opened by a very minute aperture
being made, and the matter forcibly pressed out. In two cases which
I saw, this p;ave rise to severe inflammation of the part, accompanied
with a high degree of febrile irritation.
I here subjoin the abstr~rt of a few cases lf'eated at the Spedale Santa
Maria, as illustrative of the practice pursue(~.

ceded. by ngors; two days after! the f~ver recurred, accompanied by pain and
swelhng of the lower part of the thigh, which gradually increased until his admission
to ~he hospital on the 1.8th Decembt;r, when he was bled to six ounces, with temporary
relief. The lower third of the th1gh, and the knee, are much swollen, tender to the

ITALIAN MElJICAL INSTITUTIONS. 59
Sloughing Ulcer of the Leg.-A man, aged sixty-two, was admitted into the
hospital, with foul ulcer over the tibia: the patient was labouring under considerable
nervous irritation; dry tongue, frequent pulse, skin warm. He was bled to six
ounces, and ordered to take lemonade.
On the fourth day from his admi8sion, the skin was cool; pulse weak and quick;
tongue brown and dry; and he had slight delirium.-Bl"
eeding to three ounces;
lemonade; poultice to the ulcer.
Sixth day. 'Vandered more in his talk; countenance sunk; pulse feeble; con-
siderable difficulty in breathing-bleeding to four ounees; lemonade. Eighth day,
died.
Strangulated Femoral lfernia.-A woman, aged forty-five, was admitted under
the care of professor Andreini, with femoral hernia: symptoms of strangulated
intestine had existed eleven hours. The patient had vomited several times, and
.had pain and tenderness on pressure of the lo.wer part of her abdomen; the tumour
was of the size of a walnut, and somewhat painful. Venesection to eight ounces.
Two hours after admission, the operation was performed. No attempt was made
to reduce the tumour by the taxis.
The patient being laid her whole length on the operating- table, to which her legs
were tied down, one of the pupils, under the direction of the Professor, made the
preliminary incisions tlJr011gh the skin, fascire, and hernial sac, by which a knuckle
of intestine, of a dark red eoloUI·, was exposed ; the Professor then endeavoured to
pass his finger up to the seat of stricture, but experienced considerable difficulty,
which was doubtless increased by the tension in which .the parts were kept, from
the position of the patient. Having at length reached the stricture, a small straight
bistouri cache was introduced by the Professor, and its division effected by an in-
cision made in the direction of the symphysis of the pubis. The intestine was then
reduced without ditnculty.
Shortly after the operation, the patient had an evacuation from the_ bowels. In
the course of eight hrmrs, the pulse increased in frequency, accompanied with more
tenderness of the abdomen on pressure. Eight ounces of blood were abstracted, by
which the symptoms were for a time relieved: but, on the following day, the patient
had pain all over the abdomen, attended with tension, vomiting, and quick small
pulse. Venesection to three ounces, and fomentations to the abdomen were em-
ployed. These means afforded no relief; hiccough supervened, and fcecal matter
made its appearance at the wound; half an ouncf! of castor oil was then ordered,
which occasioned slight evacuation per anum. The patient, however, died on the
fourth morning from the operation.
In this case are chiefly remarkable the absence of urgent symptoms at the time
of the patient's admission; the position in which she was placed for thf! operation;
the nugatory effect of the means employed to combat the subsequent inflammation;
and the non-employment of laxatives, from a fear of thereby increasing the inflam-
mation of the bowels.
T1·eatment ufter Litlwtomy.-A boy, aged eight years, underwent the lateral
operation for stone in the bladder, and went on well until the fifth day from the
operation, when he was attacked with pain and tenderness on pressure of the
abdomen, accompanied by fever and constipation of the bowels; the urine passed
freely away by the wound. He was ordered venesection to six ounces, a poultice
to the abdomen, and to drink lemonade. The severity of the symptoms was by
these means mitig-ated, but the bowels continued constipated.
On the fifth day, the bleeding was repeated to the amount of four ounces. On
the seventh day, the same quantity of blood was abstracted from the arm, and
leeches applied to the abdomen: the patient had a slight evacuation, and felt
somewhat relieved; the symptoms, ho~vever, were not removed, and he was greatly
redneed.
On the eighth day half an ounce of castor oil was prescribed, which produced
four or five copious evacuations from the bowel:>; the patient, in consequence, felt
great relief, the p'lin and tenderness of the abdomen shortly after sub8ided, and he
gradually recovered.
Catnracl.-A young woman, aged twenty, was admitted with capsular tataract
affecting both eyes, so as to occasion complete blindness, which had existed upwards
60 ITALlAN MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.
of two years; the patient was, however, able to distingnish a strong ligl~t. ~om
darkness. The operation of couching was performed on the left eye, from w IC no
apparent benefit was derived, and she left the hospital. Shortly afterwards, she
oecame better able to distinguish the degrees of light or darkness; in a few day~, she
obtained a confused view of obje:cts, and ultimately was able to. see .par~wul~r
objects pretty clearly. It appears that the retina had been so long mactlve m th1s
case, that some time was rt>quired for regaining its sensibility. . .
Contracted Cicatrix.-A boy, aged fourteen, was admitted to the hospital, ~avi~g
permanent semi-flexion of the fore-arm, in consequence of contraction of t.he c~catnx
from a burn: the contraction had existed ten years. The whole of the CicatriX ~as
excised with a scalpel; the edges of Ihe wound retained in contact by adhesive
plaster; and a splint fixed along the anterior part of the limb, which was thus ~ept
in a state of extension during the cure. The wound was healed, and the patient
had regained free motion of the fore-arm at the expiration of three months.
Strangulated Pemoral Hernia.-In this patient a woman, aged forty, the strangu-
lation had existed twenty hours ; during which time blPeding, the warm bath, and
fomentations, wert> employed, without relief to the pain, vomiting, and hkcough,
which symptoms had gone on increasing. On her admission, the operation was
performed, and the intestine reduced with little difficulty : after the operation, she
was bled; and an emollient enema injected, which occasioned free evacuation of the
bowels. The inflammatory symptoms were slight: the bleeding was, however,
repeated twice; and on the fourth day was ordt>red half an ounce of castor-oil.
The patient left the hospital in three weeks.
Strangulated Inguinal Ilernia.-A man, a~;t>d fifty-six, was received into the
hospital with strangulated inguinal hernia: the strangulation had existed twenty-
four hours. The operation was immediately performed. On opening the hernial
sac, a quantity of bloody serum escaped, and a portion of small intestine presented
itself, in a high state of inflammation. After dividing the stricture, the intestine
was reduced, although with some difficulty. Severe inflammatory symptoms came
on, which were relieved by energetic depletion; (was bled five times in thirty-six
hours.) No alvine evacuation having taken place on third day from the opera-
tion, notwithstanding enemata had been administered, he was ordered an oleaginous
axative, which procured copious stools, to his great benefit. Some days after,
however, frecal matter passed out from the wound, and the patient had a recurrence
of the inflammatory symptoms; these were relieved by appropriate measures; but
the patient having eaten some indigestible food the inflammation returned and
occasioned his death.
Recto-vesical Lithotomy.-The patient was sixty-one years of ao-e, and has been
subject to symptoms of calculus in the bladder for twenty-five ye~rs: the prostate
gland was considerably enlarged, and he 'passed his urine with g-reat pain and
difficulty;_ the urine was loaded with mucus, and occasionally mixed with blood.
After~ few days' rest, the recto:vesical. opera!io~ was performed, and two large
cal?uh ex~racted : ~fter the operatwn, antiphlog.stiC means were employed, and the
patient enJoyed durin.g some days a state of g;eater eas~ tha~ he had experienced
for years. On the Sixth day a~ter th~ operation, t~e. urme did not pass 3way so
f~eely ; he was attacked hy obstmate rigors, tympamtw abdomen, and died on the
eighth day. On examination, post mortem, extensive sloughing was found in the
cellular membrane between the rectum and bladder, where a quantity of urine was
collected.
. Gunshot n·ound.:-~ ~an, aged twenty-one, was shot in the hand, which occa-

was performed at the wrist joint. The stump, however, did not heal, slouo-hino- of
the tendons took place, and the patient died at the expiration of six wet>k~. After
death, an abscess was discovered, extending from beneath the deltoid muscle to
some distance beneath the pectoralis major: a collection of serum had taken place
in the thoracic cavity of the opposite side.
Hydrophobia.-A case of this disease occurred du.ring my last VIsit to Florence.

RO~IE.
THE profession is at a lower ebb in the Roman states than elsewhere
in Italy. Some of the hr.~jJitals at Rome were formerly in a shameful
state, and the mortality among the patients \Vas very great. In the
spring of last year, however, I found matters somewhat better than at
my precerlin.2; visit, though the1·e is still great room for amendment.
Acute inflammation of the lungs occasions a great mortality every
winter and spring. Bronchial affections, rheumatism, and diseases of
the eyes, though prevalent, are Jess so than at Florence and Naples.
Gastric irritation and visceral en_gorgimzent are also of frequent occur.
renee. Phthisis is not so frequent, except as consequent on attacks of
acute inflammation : bronchocele is not so often met with as in some
other parts: sudden death, from apoplexy, or disease of the heart,
called by the Italians accidente, frequently occurs at Rome: nervotls
affections are also very general, especially the morbid sensibility of the
olfactory nerves with respect to flowers and agreeable perfumes, which
exists in so high a degree as frequently to occasion convulsive attacks ;
even the sight of artificial flowers has been known to produce the same
effect. This peculiar antipathy to perfumes is met with, more or less,
in most Italian cities. I have known it also to exist in some English
residents ; the presence of flowers in a room being sufficient to pro·
duce headache and other unpleasant symptoms.
Intermittent and othe1· fevers, from m:1laria, are endemic in the sum·
mer, at which time the hospitals are crowded with patients from the
country. The insalubrity of the seJson is always in a direct ratio to
the intensity of the heat and the quantity of rain ; bu~ of late years,
since the improved drainage of the Pontine marshes, the frequency and
severity of these fe_vers have· diminished. The enervating effect of the
climate, and the habits of the Romans, also predispose them to attacks
of fever. Dr. Clark observes, that foreigner.:~ are less liable to be affected
by the malaria during the first and second years of their residence in
Rome, than in subsequent years.
The practice in the treatment of disease inclines to the Broussaian ;
the abstraction of blood in small quantities is resorted to in the majority
of cases, and as a preventive a~ainst malaria fever. Blisters are used
to combat the consequences of inflammation. The exhibition of large
doses of antimony in acute inflammation is less frequent than formerly.
In bronchial affections, prussic acid and sedatives are frequently em·
ployed. Vaccination is not much encouraged, nor is the stethoscope
used. \Vhen constitutional disorder accompanies surgical disease, the
physician is frequently called upon to prescribe, the surgeon confining
himself to ope1·ations and the application of external remedies.
· The largest hospital in Rome is the Santo Spirito, for the reception
of patients of the male sex with acute diseases. It can contain four-
teen hundred beds, but the number occupie,l varies with the season,
being comparatively small in \Vinter and spring. The building is low,

lighted, the windows being small, and placed agamst the cethn~. Some
wards are often empty; while in the principal one the patients. are

The floors and bed furniture are not the most clean ; and a stranger,
on entering, not unfrequently feels inconvenience from the c?~bination
of close air and bad smells. There is a surgical ward, contammg about
forty patients : the visit and dressings were made in a hurried anu
slovenly manner. The clinical wards above stairs are small, each con·
taining ten or twelve beds. Phthisical patients are kept in wards
separate from the others, from an apprehension of the contagiousness of
phthisis.
The hospital also contains a large theatre for the delivery of ana-
tomical lectures, a dissecting room, and a cabinet of pathological ana-
tomy. The medical service is performed by six physicians and, I
believe, one surgeon.
Intermitting fevers are treated principally by cinchona, of which
;.. large quantity is annually consumed ; thoracic inflammations by
repeated bleeding in small quantities, the administration of antimony
and blistering : in gastro-enteritic inflammation, bleeding, leeches, ene-
mata, and emollient potions, are resorted to : in rheumatic affections,
bleeding, warm baths, antimony, and other diaphoretics are employed,
the colchicum is not used.
The Spedale St. Giacomo is situated on the Corso, in the heart of
the city : it is appropriated to chronic and surgical diseases, and to the
performance of operations. The number of beds is about three hun-
dred and fifty. The men's wards, on the ground floor, are close, and
not particularly clean ; the beds being ranged, in double rows, as at
Santo Spirito : the women's wards, on the first-floor, are more clean
and airy. Very little internal treatment is employed in surgical dis-
eases, beyond small bleedings, the exhibition of cooling drinks, an
occasional laxative or opiate. The dressings are, in most cases, simple
charpie, or emollient poultices. The mortality, after aecidents and
operations, is very great, partly from the frequent supervention of hos-
pital gangrene. Ulcers and slight wounds are also very apt to run into
gangrene. The later~] operation is usually performed for the stone.
T~e cu.re of aneurism is ?ttempted by ~om.pression, low diet, and digi-
tahs : If these means fail, the operatiOn Is resorted to lio-atures of
reserve being used. Hydrocele is mostly treated by inje~tio~ : cough-
ing is the operation preferred in cataract.

the thigh and leg are treated in the extended position, the limb being
placed between two ferul~, or straight splints, connected together by
tapes, in the manner of a junk.
Tlte Spedale S Giovanni, in the square of the same name, containR
about three hundred beds, and generally two hundred patients, all
females. The principal ward contains one hundred and thirty beds, is
dean, light, and airy. On the wall are inscribed the names and amount
{)f donations of benefactors to the hospital. There are two physician:",
a surgeon, anu two assistant-physicians. Visits are made twice a day.
The Hospital for the Insane consists of two separate buildings,-
one for each sex. Each building is of a square form, and incloses a
eourt-yard, in which the patients walk about, there being no other place
for exercise. The number of beds amounts to four hundred, which are
nearly all occupied. In the day time, the patients walk about the
courts and corridors, or sit h!.~ddled up in corners; many of them with-
out shoes, and almost without clothing. In several parts, chains, with
a ring for the neck or foot, are fixed to the walls, to confine furious pa-
tients. Some of these patients occupy cells in the court-yard; the others
sleep in small but clean wards, containing each from ten to twelve beds.
There is no division of the varieties of insanity, but all are mixed indis-
criminately together. The straight waistcoat is the usual means of re-
straint, chains being only useu in extreme cases. One physician and
one surgeon are the medical attend:1nts, and the number of superintend-
ents appears extremely limited. No moral measures are resorted to in
the treatmeAt, which seems to consist principally in bleeding, warm,
-cold, and douche baths. Those patients whose bodily health is disor-
dered, are treated in a ward set apart for that purpose. The number of
.cures I should suppose to be very small.
The following cases are from the Clinique of Professor Sisco, sur-
geon to the Spedale St. Giacomo.
Diseases of Testicle.-A man, aged twenty-three, after the suppression of the
discharge of a gonorrhrea, became affected with pain, hardness, and swelling of the
right testicle. The remedies employed did not relieve him, and his surgeoR
·intended to perform the operation of castration. This was prevented by the patient
being attacked by intermitting fever, which lasted several months. On recovering
from the fever, the size of the diseased testicle had increased, the patient had
frequent lancinating pains in the part, and the scrotum was ulcerated. He was
admitted to the hospital, and on the day following an incision was made, exposing
the spermatic eord, and extending to the bottom of the scrotum. A ligature was
passed under the cord, and tied tightly. The tumour sloughed in five days, and
was separated by scissors. The wound was dressed throughout the cure with
charpie, and the patient dismissed six weeks from his admission.
A man, aged thirty~eight, bad long been afflicted with sarcocele, which the treat-
ment employed had not benefited; he was obliged to go into the country, and there
consulted a surgeon, who, considering the disease to be hydrocele, plunged a trocar
into the tumour: as no fluid escaped, he made an incision through the scrotum,
and lacerated with his finger it" connexions with the tumour, which occasioned an
increase in its size, and considerable constitutional disturbance to the patient. The
eurgeon then passed a seton through its substance; the patient became worse,
returned to ltome, and was admitted into the hospital. The tumour was of the
size of a small melon, uneven and t•1berculated on its surface, and discharging,
lhrough the apertures made by the seton, dark fetid matter. The patient was greatly

reduced, with irritable pulse, ann troubled 'Yith diarrh~a. Aft_er ~hree days' rest, ~
bistoury was plunged into the tumour, winch was laid open m 1ts whole. extent·
about a pound and a half of fungous substance of a livid colour was excised, the
operator fearing· to remove the whole tumour,_ on .accou~t of the weak state of the
patient. The bleeding was restrained by ap-phcatwn of IC.e. . ,
On the seventh day from the operation, a ligature w~s tied tightly round the bat>e
ofthe tumour, which separated in five days. The patient gradually recovered, and
was quite well at the expiration of seven weeks. . . . .
A man, aged tv;enty-two, had disease of the testiCle: whwh was situated m !he
groin, whence it had never descended to the scrotum. ~he tumour was of t~e size
of a lemou, hard at its base, with a feeling of fluctuatiOn at other parts; It was
punctured with a trocar, and a quantity of fluid escaped. On the day following,
the spermatic cord was exposed hy an incision, and a ligature passed under it, tied
tightly. Mortification of the testicle soon came on: in a few days, however, the
patient experienced some stiffness in the motions of the lower jaw; tetanus super-
vened, and he died.
Popliteal .!J.neurism.-A man aged thirty-six, in pursuing his adversary, exerted
himself very much; a few days after, he discovered a swelling in his left ham,
which quickly iucreased to the size of a hen's egg. On admission to the hospital,
it was ascertained to be popliteal aneuri!::m. The cure was attempted by restricting
the patient to low diet, giving the digitalis, and compressing the femoral artery at
its upper third by a semicircular spring, pressing on the artery and opposite side of
the thigh. This treatment was continued some days, but did not affect the size of
the tumour, to which ice was applied, without advantage resulting. It was then
proposed to the patient to have the femoral artery tied, or the limb amputated : the
patient would only submit to the amputation, which was consequently performed.
It appears that he wished to die, and thought he should sink under the ampntation;
being disappointed in this, the same night he swallowed a quantity of opium,
which he had concealed, and died the following morning.
NAPLES.
~A;LES is bt~ilt along .Part of the bay of that n.ame, and partly on the
acclivity of a hdl; contains three hundred and eighty thousand inhabi-
tants. The most prevalent diseases are, imflammations of the lun!TS
pleuritis, bronchial affections, rheumatism, gastric fevers, and disea~e~
of the eyes.
Naples contains three hospitals. The Spedale degl' Incurabili is
the largest: it is situated in an elevated and airy position in the centre
of the city, and can contain one thousand four hundred beds. The
building is two stories high, and built rou~d a courtyard; the wards are
long and lofty, clean? and pretty ~·ell ventilat~d. This hospital is pro-
p~rly for the receptiOn of .chrome and surgical diseases; many acute
d1seases are, however, admitted.
As at other Italian h~spitals, some rooms are set apart for patients -
who pay from four to SIX carlini daily. Syphilitic and consumptiv:
patients have also wa~ds sepa~ate from .the others. There is also an
mcurable ward, to wh1ch monbund patients, or those considered past
recovery, are transferred. Female patients are attended on by "sreurs

ue a c ante; t e men y m rmiers, or Ill rmary men; the medi-
ITALlAN MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 65
cal service is performed by twenty physicians and fourteen surgeons.
Daily visits are made at an early hour.
The lectures of the Colleges of :Medicine and Surgery on the several
branches of medicine and surgery are here delivered; clinical lectures
on medical and surgical cases, and on diseases of the eyes, are also given.
Dr. Quadri is professor of this last branch of surgery: he employs de-
pletion and warm applications only at the commencement of acute
ophthalmia; in the varieties of chronic inflammation, he has recourse to
counter-irritation and stimulating collyria.
The practice is chiefly" Hippocratique," the administration of reme-
dies being determined by observation of the symptoms in each par-
ticular case. Bleeding is not so general as at Florence and Rome ;
antimony and James's powder are in very general use in acute disease :
this remedy, however, is not gi,·en in the same large doses as formerly.
In syphilitic cases, mercurial frictions are made in the sole of the foot,
and continued for about twenty minutes each time, by an assistant,
whose hand is covered by a leathern glove. Vital operations are only
performed in spring and autumn, except in cases of emergency. Over
the operating theatre a hand is painted, with an eye in the palm.
The dressings made use of to wounds are mostiy simple, stimulating
applications being rarely used: union by the first intention is attempted,
where practicable.
The following cases will illustrate the practice pursued.
Pneumonia and Typhoid Fever.-A man aged fifty-five, was received into the
hospital, labouring under fever, accompanied by great prostration of strength, fixed
pain in left side of thorax, great difficulty in breathing, expectoration of bloody
mucus, anxious expression of countenance, and brownish dry tongue. He was
ordered venesection to the amount of fourteen ounces ; leeches to the side; an
ounce of castor oil; and a mixture containing nitrate of potass. The thoracic
symptoms were much relieved hy these means: the patient was, however, greatly
weakened, and had dry, brown tongue.
On the third day he was ordered a blister to the side, and a mixture containing
tartarized antimony.
On the eighth day, he was more weak, and had occasional hiccup. Same medi-
cine continued.
On the eighth day, two or three lumbrici were passed from the bowels, with
several copious evacuations of fetid matter. He continued to get worse; delirium
supervened, and he died on the twelfth day from his admission.
On examining the body, traces of inflammation were apparent in the stomach and
ileum; the pleura was strongly adhering on left side; and small abscesses were
found in left lung, which was in part hepatized.
Drop.w with Hypertrophy ofthe Heart.-A keeper of a cook-shop, aged forty-five,
was admitteo, with ascites, edema of lower extremities, and great difficulty of
breathing; he had laboured under dyspncea for several months past; the pulse
was, however, regular; he had no cough nor thirst, and passed his urine freely.
The means of relief employed were, the repeated application of leeches to the
anus; giving the patient supertartrate of potass every morning, two grains of squill
powder every night, and putting him on milk diet: the disease however made pro-
gress. The diuretics were varied, and the digitalis given, but without benefit: and
the patient died fifteen days after his admission. The diagnosis on his admission
was hydrothorax, followed by abdominal and serous effusion.
On examination, post mortem, the peritoneum and intestines were healthy;
several quarts of fluid in the abdomen; liver enlarged and tuberculated; extensive
adhesions of the pleurre: lungs slightly inflamed; the heart much increased in size
66 ITALIAN MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.
and sof!ened in its substance; asr.ending aorta greatly dilated. The quantity of
serum found in the thorax was less than had been anticipated.
Jlcute .flscites.-A porter, aged thirty-two, who had enjoyed good gen~r~l hc~l~h,
was admitted into the hospital, with ascites ~nd anasarc?us lower extremlti.es. ll1e
abdomen was not much distended, but flmd wa& readlly felt on pe.rcusswn. J-~e
first felt himself indisposed after exposure to wet and cold, a fortmght before his
admission.
On admission he had thirst and dry skin; the tougue was redder than natur~l;
pulse regular, but hard; bowels constipated; urine scanty. He was ordered ~Ilk
diet, a bleeding from the arm, and saline purgatives. In. a few days, a sensible
amelioration had taken place; the abdomen was less tumid, and the anasarca of
the lower extremities had diminished. A continuance in the same plan completed
the cure, and he left the hospital three weeks after admission.
Cll1'01dc Jlscites.-The patient, a man aged forty-five, was of an emaciated and
cachectic appearance; he resided in a marshy district, and had felt, for some weeks
previous to application for relief, obscure wandering pains in the abdomen; great
weakyess; he experienced constant thirst, and his urine was scanty. When ad-
mitted into the hospital, the existence ()f fluid in the abdomen was apparent on
percussion; the tongue was clean, and no appearance of disease of the liver existed.
The ascit~s was considered to be the result of chronic peritonitis, the predisposing
cause of which was the malarious influence to which he had been constantly sub-
jected. He was sent to an establishment for convalescents in the country; was
allowed to walk in the open air; prescribed milk diet; half an ounce of oxymel of
squills night and morning. A few weeks passed over without any perceptible
change for the better or worse. The quantity of oxymel was increased to two
ounces daily, and blisters were applied to different parts of the abdomen. By per-
severance in this plan, he recovered firm health, and was discharged three months
after application at the hospital. .
Popliteal.llneurism.-A man aged sixty, ofgood constitution, was received with an
aneurism of the size ofa small orange in the right ham: he had no appearance of any
other disease ofthe vascular system. Low diet, bleeding, digitalis, and the application
of cold to the tumour, were the means prescribed. This treatment was continued
fo~ some weeks,. without effect. The femoral artery was then tied in the upper
thud of the thigh; a ligature of reserve was employed. The pulsation in the
tumour ceased, and all went on well for some days, when the pulse became more
frequent, and occasionally intermitted. A bleeding from the arm was practised,
and cooling drinks ordered. In a few day3 the pulse became more weak, and
cough, dyspnrea, and spitting of blood supervened; the bleeding was repeated, and
hyoscyamus given: the pulmonic symptoms yielded; the patient recovered his
strength, and, being cured of the aneurism, was dismissed in three months.
The_ establishment for the insane at Aversa, near Naples, is the most
extens1ve and best regulated of the kind in Italy, but its advantages
!1ave b~en exaggerated in most of the accounts which have been given.
fhe ~dlfice, for~erly _a convent, has a neat fac;ade, and is built round an
extenor and an mtenor court-yard; in the latter many of the patients
are assembled, but they are not allowed to walk in the former. On the
sides are dining rooms of the rich and poor patients, with the baths in-
cluding douche, shower, and a surprise-b:1th in a separate room. This
latter is on a level with the floor, and covered with mattina: the p~tient
on advancing falls in unexpectedly: it is not however ~uch used at
present.
On the first floor is a long gallery,_ with cells originally occupied by
the monks, but now converted into rooms, containina three or four
beds; as these cells were intended for only one pers~n there is not
sufficient space, the beds are necessarily placed close to e~ch other, and
ITALlAN MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 67
the air becomes vitiated. Those persons who pay a pension of twelve
ducats a month, have a cell to themselves; as also better and more
abundant nourishment than the poorer patients. At one extremity of
the gallery is a small chamber, containing several vertical beds for
furious patients, whose legs are placed in a l<ind of case lined with
leather and fastened by a padlock; the straight waistcoat is also used.
At another part of the gallery is a darkened chamber. Dr. Vulpes
speaks advantageously of its effects in quieting intractable patients: at
the opposite extremity of the gallery is the co~versation-room, which
contains a piano, with other musical instruments, and various resources
for amusement.
The house contains two hundred and sixteen men; some are employed
in ~ardening, but the greater number assemble in the interior court-yard.
\:Vhat most characterises this establishment is thP: regularity which
prevails in all the departments : on the ringing of the bell the patients
rise, assemble in the refectory, and breakfast with d€'corum and tran-
quillity; quiet patients are present at prayers. This regularity must
produce a very good effect.
Incomplete genera1 paralysis is as rare at Aversa as it is common
at Charenton. The diseases under which the majority of patients
succumb, are apoplexy, diseases of the chest, aneurism and gastro-
enterite.
Professor V ulpcs divides the patients into curable and incurable, and
establishes a first class composed of furious patients; second class, tur-
bulent an.d talkative patients; third .class, those dirty in their persons;
fourth, monomaniacs.
There are chambers of observation, where patients arc placed on
admission till the nature of their alienation is ascertained. The remedies
most frequently used arc bleeding, leeches, and emetics; the grea~est
reliance is, however, placed on the moral treatment. The most common
causes of insanity arc, love and religion among women ; vanity, pride,
and fear, among men.
Ther.c is at Aversa, a second hospital for women, whose number is
two hundred and thirty-six. 1\I. Briere de Boismont, from whose
pamphlet the preceding account is taken, does not speak in high terms
of this institution, where the inmates, although subjected to no bad
treatment, are too closely crowded together. He terminates his obser-
vations with a table, which tends to show that ins:mity is less common
in Italy than in France, England, Scotland, or Norway ; and that mental
alienation is frequent in proportion as countries are le.ss quiet, and more
advanced in civilization. Thus Turkey, Egypt, and Russia, contain
very few insane, and in northern Italy, where information is more gen-
erally diffused, the number is nearly don ble to what it is in the south.
The causes which act almost exclusively in Italy in producing alienation,
are amhiti.:m, vanity, pride, love, and religious fanaticism ; this last is
most frequent among women. Pellagra, in the north, is one of the
most frcq!Jent cause8.

PART ill.
GERl\IAN lVIEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.
THE hospitals of Germany, like those of France and Italy, are under
the superintendence of their respective governments ; but are inferior
in point of size and interior organiz~tion. They a;e mostly supporte?
by funds derived from taxes on panshes and districts, and by contri-
butions from servants and others of inferior classes, who thus, when
ill, acquire a title to admission. Some of the ~atients also pay a cer~ain
sum weekly for their support. A fixed salary IS allotted to the medical
men, who are not elected by public competition, but are mostly ap-
pointed by government. Hired nurses attend upon the sick, there
heing no religious sisterhood to undertake this duty. The bodies of
those who die in hospitals are generally examined, though morbid
anatomy is not very zealously cultivated. Professional visits are made
daily, at a later hour than in French and Italian hospitals.
Germany contains upwards of twenty universities-a larger number
than any other country. The situation of most of them in small quiet
towns is well calculated to favour studious habits.
The relations between professors and students are murh more intimate
than in France and Italy, and the love of science is stronger than in
those countries. This devotion to science, and seclusion from general
society, occasionally gives rise, however, to a degree of pedantry and
confined views, even in men of extensive acquirements, and no where
are there so many poor savans as in Germany.
In most universities the instructing body forms a part of the state.
The chief has th·e title of Rector 1.\tlagnificus, a dignity frequently
retained by the prince himsel£ As the rector cannot always personally
superintend the affairs, most universities hayc a pro-rector chosen
annuaiiy from among the professors. After the pro-rector come the
deans of the faculties, also chosen from the professors, and lastly the
professors, who are divided into three kinds, private professors, extraor-
dinary professors, and ordinary professors.
Th~ usual manner of ?ecoming attached t~ an university is to begin
by fillmg the offic~ of pnv~t~ professor, who 1~ not a I.m?lic functionary,
but who has the r1ght of gtvtng lectures, and If he dtsttnguish himself
is appointed an extraordinary professor when a vacancy occurs : he i~
then a servant of the state and receives emolument. The highest degree
is that of ordinary professor, who has a higher salary and peculiar
p1·ivile~es. It results from. this arrangement that; the number of pro-
fessors IS very great; the dtfferent branches of science being frequently
taught by two or three at the same time. It is customary in most
universities for students to pay for attendance on the courses of lectures.
GERi\IAN MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 69
Those of the Austrian states form, however, an exception. Professors
arc indeed obliged to give a public course every six months: this,
however, treats only of secondary objects : the most important courses
are neyer gratuitous.*
The students, notwithstanding the roughness of manners which
prevails in some universitie~, are for the niost part attentive, perse-
vering, regular in attendance, and decorous in their behaviour, in the
lecture-room. Of late years drinking, quarrelling, and taking part in
political disturbances, occur much less frequently among them.
The practice of medicine is not in general based upon any particular
theory, but is regulated by the observation of symptoms in individual
cases, and approaches nearer to the English than to the French method.
The abstraction of blood, both by venesection and leeches, is less
frequently had recourse to than in France and England, but active
internal medicines are pretty generally employed: baths and enemata
are also much used, while tisanes, infusions of simple herbs and de-
mulcent potions are not usually given, except as vehicles for the
exhibition of more energetic medicaments.
Auscultation and percussion do not find many adopters in Germany, ·
and lithotrity has, I believe, only been performed at Berlin. Medicines
are not in general given in surgical diseases with a view to their con-
stitutional operation, and, with the exception perhaps of Berlin, the
management of surgical cases is very inferior to that of England and
France. As, howev<ir, the practice varies considerably in different
parts, it will be best illustrated by reference to individual hospitals.
STUTTGARD.
THE population of Stuttgard is thirty thousand. The hospital is a
neat edifice of recent erection, a short distance from the town, contain-
ing three hundred beds, with· furniture of the best kind, disposed in
small, but clean and airy wards. In summer not more than half the
beds are occupied, but in winter the proportion of patients is much
g1·eater; the majority are medical cases: the surgical patients are few
in number, and it is seldom that operations of importance are required.
There are two physicians and a surgeon, who receive a salary: that of
the first physician, is eight hundred florins. The nomination of the
medical officers rests with the minister of the interior, who, when a
vacancy occurs, chooses from four candidates selected by the town; the
choice is usually made according to the recommendation ofthe physician:
an assistant physician and an apothecary reside in the house. The hos-
pital also contains obstetric wards, where about one hundred and sixty
women are annually delivered.

70 GERMAN MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.
There is no endemic disease in the neighbourhood of Stuttgard: at
the time of my visit the principal diseases in the hospital were ~ervo~s
and gastric fevers, bronchial affections, rheumatism, and chlorosis; .this
last disease is extremely prevalent, and is mostly treated by.preparati?ns
of iron and ammonia. The treatment of nervous fever vanes accordmg
to the circumstances of each case; bleeding, leeches, laxatives, mineral
acids in a mucilaginous beverage, lavements, cold lotions to the head,
with tonics when required, are the remedie.s most usually res.orted ~o.
The means commonly employed in rheumatism are blood-lcttmg, blis-
ters purgatives and diaphoretics ; as tartarized antimony, Dover's
po\~der, and guaiacum. In abdominal inflammation bleeding, l~eching,
mucilaginous drinks, and enemata are usually trusted to: purgatives arc
given when the violence of the inflammation is somewhat lessened.
Sciatica is treated by blisters applied, not over the trunk of the sciatic
nerve, but below the knee, so as to encircle the leg; this method is said
to procure a speedy cure in most cases. lVforphine is also administered
by the endermic method, with great success in neuralgic affections: the
strychnine has been employed here by the same method with great
advantage in some cases of paralysis.
Among the patients was a young man with well marked elephantiasis
of the right inferior extremity, which was more than thrice as large as
its fellow. The patient had never leO: the neighbourhood of Stuttgard,
and the causes which induced the disease were unknown, the physician
never having met with a case originating in the country. His appear-
ance was cachectic, and he had had the disease several years without
any amendment having taken place; he was, however, able to get about,
and only complained of difficulty of breathing after exertion, and of
occasional pains in the abdomen, the lower part of which felt very hard
to the touch.
The surgical wards presented little of interest except a fractured thigh,
treated in the extended position by an apparatus consisting of a perfo-
rated foot-board, through which straps are passed, and confining both
feet keep up the extension: the sound limb has a splint on the outer side
along its whole length. The fractured thigh is enclosed by splints
reaching from the hip to the knee, below which a padded compress is
fixed, and extension is made, by the straps from the foot-board being
attached to the compress.
The University of Ttibingen, the only one in the kin<Tdom of \Virt-
emberg, is about thirty-five miles distant fmm Stuttganf. It is one of
the most ancient of the German universities, having been founded in
1477, and was formerly in a most prosperous condition, but suffered
much dUI·ing the thirty years war, since which it has never recovered
itself; though even no\Y it bears marks of its ancient splendour. Its
present comparative prosperity is owing in great measure to the late
professor Autenreilh, who, in 1819, was elected grand chancellor and
who notwithstanding filled the office of professor of clinical medi'cine.

and materia medica, Gmelin. The clinical establishment is well arranged,
but the scientific collections are small, and offer but little to interest.
The library contains about eighty thousand volumes. The number of
students resorting to Tubingen, averages between five and six hundred
annually.
NUREMBERG.
ALTHOUGH containing forty thousand inhabitants, there is no regular
hospital at Nuremberg; the erection of one is, however, in contempla-
tion. The sick poor are principally treated at their own habitations, at
the charge of a society to which the magistrates greatly contribute.
An ancient and ruinous looking building on the riv.er is used as an
hospital, and contains five hundred beds mostly occupied by aged and
infirm paupers, not more than sixty being appropriated to the recep-
tion of the sick ; the rooms are large but low, and ill-ventilated, too
many persons being crowded in the same apartment. Those for the
sick are dirty looking, and small, containing each from four to ten beds.
Three physicians attend the hospice. I accompanied one of these, as
well as the surgeon, in their visits ; but it appeared that my society
would have been gladly dispensed with, as the visits were made in a
hurried manner, and very few questions were asked, notwithstanding
two or three of the patients were dangerously ill ; there were, however,
no cases of particular interest, and from what I saw, as well as from
the answers I received, I should apprehend that the science of medicine
is at a low ebb in Bavaria. In another hospice, a short distance from
the town, rooms are appropriated to patients with psora, and syphilitic
affections. The interior of the bllilding has more the appearance of a
barn than of an hospital, and the rooms are as comfortless as can be
imagined. A physician visits three times a week. Scabies is treated
as at Stuttgard, by the inunction of green soft soap : the average
duration of treatment is about a week.
There is also at Nuremberg, an institution for diseases of the eyes,
containing between thirty and forty beds, established by the oculist
who has charge of the patients, but to which the government contri-
butes, as well as those patients who are able. The patients are treated
in darkened rooms, many of them having thick pads bound over their
eyes, which must tend to keep up an undue degree.of heat : local mea-
sures appear to be principally employed, and counter-irritants are much
used.
PRAGUE.
PRAGUE contains a large university, a general hospital, with three
hundred beds, a large military hospital ; a neat hospital of one hundred
72 GERMAN MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.
beds for men in the convent of the Barmherzige BrUder, a brotherh~od
who attend upon the sick, in twenty-seven hospitals of the. Austna.n
states, and a similar hospital of sixty beds .for wo1?1en. Thts latter lS
also within the walls of a con'vent, the patients b.emg attend~d on by
the sisters, forty-five in number: the wards, wtth the .c~rrHl~rs and
galleries are plentifully decorated with badly executed r~hgwus •.mages
and pa;ntings. At this as well as at the correspondmg hospttal for
men, a physician visits eve:·y morning. .
The wards of the principal hospital are clean and a1ry ; each con-
taining from eight to fourteen beds. Th.e .medical ~t~endants are two
physicians, who are the professors of chmcal m~dteme, the pro~e~sor
of clinical surgery, and the professor of ophthahmc surgery. Chmcal
discourses are held, and reports of cases read in Latin at the. bedside of
patients: the clinical examinations of candidates for the dtploma also
take place in the wards. In order to be admitted, patients must pro-
duce a certificate signed by the magistrate, the parish priest, and the
master of the house in which they reside.
Antiphlogistic measures ~o not appear to be energetically employed
in the treatment of acute disease, internal medicines and counter-irrita-
tion being mostly trusted to. Experiments of new methods are also
frequently made. At the tirne of my visit there were several cases of
rheumatism in thE' house, which were treated by the administration of
large quantities of warm water, and it is said very successfully. This
method origin:lted, I believe, not long since at JVIunich, and is adopted
in some parts of Germany, in acute and chronic rheumatism, as also in .
some other diseases. The other cases in the physicians' wards were
intermittents, bilious fevers, bronchitis, chlorosis, epilepsy, and other
nervous affections.
Twenty of the most interesting cases in the surgical department are
selected for the clinical wards. Surgery does not, however, stand high
at Prague. l\1edicine is seldom giren except in diseases depending
upon a constitutional taint. Among the cases was a dislocation of the
inferior extremity of the ulna, with extensive wound on the fore part
of the wrist. This was trea~ed by a ~ingle. splint applied along the
back of the fore-arm, extendmg from Its nnddle beyond the fin<Ters
and maintained in position by a narrow bandage passed rounl' th~
palm of the hand, and the centre of the fore-arm : the constriction of
the bandage, if it did not give rise to, was evidently keepin<T up the
erysipelatous inflammation, which extended from the wound to ~orne
distance above the elbow. There were also a case of fractured neck
of the humerus treated by keeping the patient in bed with his arm in
a sling, no splints or ?andages ha,·ing been used : ~ bad compound
fracture of the leg, whtch was suspended on narrow bands connecting
the two branches of a wooden frame; the _foot being fixed and sus-
pended o? the same level, by a band passmg beneath the heel. No
lateral splints were employed, and the leg was fixed merely by two or
th:ee straps of bandage passed ~cross it b~low the patella : a fractured
thigh treated by an external splint extending from the trochanter below
the knee, and another on the anterior part of the limb, there being
GERMAN .MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 73
none on its inner side to give support and to sustain the pressure of the
bandage.
The ophthalmic wards contain about thirty beds for the treatment
of diseases of the eyes. Bleeding and stimulating lotions are not very
freely employed, as the surgeon trusts more to blisters, occasional pur-
gatives, emollient or slightly astringent lotions. There is also a syphi-
litic ward, where mercurial inunction appears to be the remedy princi-
pally trusted to.
The university of Prague is the most ancient in Germany, though at
present it only holds a secondary rank in a scientific point of view, and
does not keep pace with the advanced state of knowledge in other parts.
It was founded in 1348, and at one time counted several thousand
students, who were classed according to the nations whence they came.
It received, however, ashock from the disputes in the beginning of the
fifteenth century, which it never recovered, and continued in a very
depressed state, till the reign of Joseph the Second, under whom, and
the late emperor, it has somewhat improved. The number of students
is at present about fifteen hundred, of these the greater number study
theology. Here and in other Austrian universities the course of
education is. attended with no expense to the students, the professors
deriving their salaries entirely from the government.
Five years is the required period of study preparatory to the ex-
amination for a medical diploma. The three first are devoted to
attendance on the different lectures, the two last principally to the
cliniques, pupils having patients placed under their care, of whose
progress they are required from time to time to render an account.
Pupils are examined every six months during their studies; the final
examinations for the diploma are two; the first is on anatomy, phy-
siology, natural history, medical and sUI·gical pathology and therapeutics,
before the dean, and the professors of these sciences : the second is on
chemistry, materia medica, medical jurisprudence, practice of medicine
and surgery, and clinical examinations at the bedside. A thesis must
also be written and defended. Surgical candidates have likewise to
perform two operations on the dead body, describing the steps of the
ope1·ation, the advantages 'of various metho·ds, &c. The expenses of
examination amount to about twenty pounds.
The same regulations are adopted in all the Austrian universities.
The building is a vast and imposing structure, enclosing a large
c'ourt-yard, situate in the centre of the old town. The amphitheatre
and lecture-rooms are large and commodious; the library, a splendid
saloon, surrounded by spacious corridors, is well arranged, contains
upwards of one hundred thousand volumes, and is particularly rich in
ancient theological works; the chemical laboratory and the anatomical
rooms are in a separate building, and are small and incommodious.
Adjoining is a small and indifferent pathological collection. Anatomy
is ve1·y superficially studied in the Austrian states, and the practice of
surgery is considered to be very inferior.

DRESDEN.
THERE is no aood hospital at Dresden. The Stadt Kranken H{LUS,
or Infirmary is ~low antic1uated buildina in one of the suburbs, having

more the appearance of a farmhouse than of an osptta . t contams
one hundred and fifty patients, though as many as one hundred and
eighty could be accommodated. The rooms are placed on either side
long and badly ventilated corridors ; and are clean, but small, few
containing more than eight beds. There are baths in the house, but
they are not in good order, and the locale is dirty. Attached to the
hospital is a large piece of ground for the use of patients able to take
out-door exercise. A physician and a surgeon visit daily in the fore-
noon ; an assistant physician and an apothecary reside in the house.
The cases are mostly chronic, as scrofula, which is very prevalent in
Dresden; jaundice, rheumatism, dropsy, chlorosis, &c. l\1ost poor
patients, with acute disease, are either visited at their own habitations
or are ser't to the clinical wards in another establishment. In the
treatment even of an acute disease, bloodletting is not very freely
employed; emetics, purgatives, and counter-irritants being often made
to supersede it. In many cases where no active inflammation exists,
stimul'ants, as the preparations of ammonia, are freely exhibited.
The surgical department also presented no cases of interest, except
one of erysipelas, with extensi,·e sloughing of the skin and cellular
texture of the inferior extremities. This had in the first instance been
treated antiphlogistically, by the repeated application of leeches ; but
recourse was had subsequently to tonics and nourishing diet, under
which the patient appeared to be improving. l\Iercury is the remedy
almost universally employed in the syphilitic wards, mercurial, and
slightly stimulating applications, being made to ulcers; secondary
symptoms appeat· to be very frequent and intractable.
Th~ _.flcadem_ie is a neat building in the town, where forty beds are
occupied by patients whose cases serve for clinical instruction. Patients
are.admitted. by tickets ob~ained from the district authorities, upon
their producmg proper certificates. Accidents and uraent cases are
ho_wever, _immediately admitted. One physician and onet:>surgeon attend
daily. .Sunple dres~m~.s are mostly made to wounds, and to ulcers not
dependm~ on constitutiOnal af!ection: sti~ulants, especially pyrolig-
ne_o~s acHl, are generally apphed to chrome ulcers of a constitutional
?ngi.n. The. day preceding my visit, the operation for strangulated
mgumal herma had ?een performed. The symptoms had been previously
very urgent; bleedmg, the war~1I bath, lavements, and the taxis, were
e_mployed. Leeches. were ~pphed :o the abdoi!len after the operation.

thigh near the hip, treated by Dessault's method, with very slight
shortening of the limb. In cases, however, where the fracture is about
the centre of the bone, the thigh is enclosed in splints reaching only to
the knee, the leg being left free. I was assured that no material short-
ening ensued upon this method.
Sonnenstein.-This is a government establishment for insane patients,
consisting of an ancient chiteau, with large grounds, on a hill overlook-
ing the town of Pirna, about four leagues from Dresden, and command-
ing an extensive prospect over a rich and beautiful country, and of the
course of the Elbe, which flows directly beneath. At the time of my
visit, the house contained one hundred and twenty men, and eighty
women ; the men are ahvays in greater proportion. The patients are
divided into three classes; those of the first class pay each six hundred
dollars per annum ; those of the second class pay from sixty upwards,
according to circumstances. The third class consists of paupers who
are supported partly by parochial taxes, but chiefly by the government.
Patients of the first class take their meals with the resident physician,
each has a separate apartment, which usually consists of a sitting-room
and bed-room, with barred windows, and plainly furnished with all
requisite articles. The other classes have each a common dining-room,
and sleep in rooms containing from six to fourteen beds. All the
apartments have barred windows, and are very clean ; soiled linen,
bedding, &c. being immediately removed. The house also {!Ontains
workshops of different trades, as carpenters, shoemakers, tailors, where
many of the patients are occupied. For the first class there is a saloon
of amusement, with books, a piano, draughts, and other ·games, as also a
billiard-room. In fine weather, however, most of the patients are
occupied out of doors, in walking about the grounds, cultivating flowers,
digging, carrying wood, water, &c. There is also a flower garden in
the women's department, which serves to occupy many of the patients;
others sew, knit, spin, or \Vash the house linen.
Patients who are furious are not in general confined to the house,
but are allowed to walk about with the rest, their hands being confined.
They also wear a cloak, in order that the apparatus for confining the
hands should not be observed by others. This method is found to have
greater effect in tranquilizing them, than if isolated and forcibly
confined to bed. Those of the first chss have a keeper to accompany
them, and to sleep in their apartment. There is in the house a separate
room for furious patients, but it has not been used latterly. l\1ania is;
however, much less frequent than the melaP.cholic variety of alienation ;
the most common causes being poverty, grief, religious enthusiasm, and
domestic troubles-the stronger passions, love, jealousy, ambition, &c.
giving rise to the disease much more rarely than in Italy and France.
In the treatment, occupation and moral means are principally trusted
to; tranquil patients, who have good bodily health, do not in general
take medicine. The medical measures most in use are occasional ab-
straction of blood, purgatives, revulsives, tepid baths, cold, sho\ver, and
douche baths. The cures are on an average as one to three among
women, one to four among the men. The lesions discovered after death

are various and are regarded as accidental and of a secon~ary nature.
The bodie; are interred in a c·emetery prettily laid out with flowers,
which grow plentifully among the tombs: . Ther~ are ?ighteen keepers
and a principal superintendent. A physician resides ~~ the house, but
the directing physician lives in Pirna. The female patie~ts are super-
intended by women. Paralysis supervenes upon alienatiOn much less
frequently than in France. . .
A path winds through a pretty garden, down the hill ~~ Its base,
where the house for convalescents is situated. 'Vhen I VISited, there
were eighteen or twenty; several of the females were seated in the
saloon, sewing, and listening to the sounds of a piano; the greater
number were, ho,vever, in the garden or surrounding country.
Sonnenstein has long been celebrated as the best institution of the
kind in Germany. The liberty allowed to the patients speaks highly
for the system of management; and in point of locality and interior
organization, there appears nothing further to be desired.
J,EIPZIC.
THIS city, the second in Saxony, contains a celebrated university and
two hospitals.
The hospital St. George, situate in an open part of the town, close
to one of the public promenades, is a large building, containing about
five hundred beds. These, however, are not all occupied by the sick,
as th~ institution serves for two or three purposes; first, as a house of
correction for minor offences; secondly, as an asylum for orphans of
both sexes, till the age 'of fourteen ; thirdly, as an hospital for the insane,
and for chronic and incurable diseases. The number of insane is
about forty; each patient has a separate cell, containing no other furni-
ture than a bed. Two or three of the cells have chairs furnished with
rings, for fixing the arms and legs, in which the more refractory patients
are confined; the usual means of coercion, however, is the strait waist-
coat. But little appears to be done in the way of treatment· the dis-
positi?n of tlie locale, and the want. ~f e:cercise .ground, pr~vent the
arloptwn of moral measures, and meciicme IS not given unless called for
by bodily disorder or unusual mental excitement: the remedies consist
mostly of revulsives and counter-irritants. A new buildin(T is however
in contemplation, in which the insane, and patients with ~hronic dis-
eases, will be separated from the other inmates.
The hospital St. Jacques is in an isolated and somewhat humid
situation, in one of the suburbs. It consists of several portions of build-
ing, enclosing a garden, and contains two hundred beds thou•rh in July
the numbe~ of patients did not exceed one hundre? and'fifty.

of clinical medicine and surgery to the university ; an assistant physi-
cian and an assistant surgeon reside in the house. l\fost of the p1tients
confined to bed in the medical wards were labouring under intermittent
fever, rheumatic affections, and chronie thoracic disease. Intermittents
are treated by tartarized antimony at the commencement, and subse-
quently by quinine; rheumatism is treated by local abstraction of blood,
blisters, and diaphoretics; baths not being much used. In pneumonia
the treatment by large doses of antimony is preferred to sanguineous
depletion, which is only employed when the inflammation rises high;
blisters are also used in most cases.
In diseases not attended by fever, purgatives, tonics, and stimulants,
are pretty generally employed.
VVards separate from ~he rest are allotted to patients with psora and
syphilitic diseases; the former disease is treated as in some other parts
of Germany, by inunction with green soap and afterwards baths. In
the latter class of diseases, regimen and simple applications are princi-
pally trusted to, when the symptoms are merely local; when, however,
secondary symptoms a'ppear, mercurial friction is resorted to. Clinical
discourses are held in Latin at the bedside of the patients.
The hospitals of Leipzic are supported as in most other German
towns, partly by government and partly by contributions from the dif-
ferent districts of the town. There is also a private homreopathic hos-
pital, of which I have made mention in the Appendix.
The university of Leipzic is one of the most flourishing in Germany,
having been long celebrated for its theologians, its jurisconsults, and
philosophers; and although the surrounding country has been repe_at-
edly the seat of wars, it has never retrogaded, but continues to hold the
high rank it acquired during the struggle for the establishment of Lu-
theranism. As at other universities, there are four faculties-theology,
law, medicine, ami philosophy. The number of teachers is about eighty,
that of the students upwards of a thousand; of these about two hundred
follow the medical classes. Five years' study are required of candi-
dates for the medical diploma, four years for the surgical diploma. The
expense of the course of study amounts to about six hundred dollars.
Poor students in the different faculties are, however, assisted by the
university; between two and three hundred dine and sup gratuitously,
in a building termed the Convictorium. l\Iedical students undergo two
examinations; the first a theorectical examination after the third year;
the second is practical, and is termed rigorosum; the candidate being
examined in the medical sciences during four or five hours, by five or
six professors. The following are among the most distinguished pro-
fessors: anatomy, \Veber-physiology, KUhn-pathology and thera-
peutics, Cerutti-clinical medicine, Glarus-clinical surgery, IGihl.
The building formed part of the Paulinum, an ancient convent, which
is now in great part destroyed, and a handsome and commodious struc-
ture erected in its place.
78 GERMAN MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.
BERLIN.
THIS metropolis contains the most celebrated university in Germany;
numerous charitable institutions, some supported by government, others
by voluntary contributions of the inhabitants; eight military hospitals;
a large general hospital; a small hospital for clinical surgery, and an
hospital, with four hundred beds, for individuals of the Jewish religion.
The Clwrite, Kranh:en Haus, is a large handsome building, three
stories high, for the reception of patients with acute and chronic dis-
eases and meatal alienation. It is situate in a healthy locality, and con-
tains eight hundred beds. The w~rds are small, Lut airy and clean.
The theatre for operations and clinical leC"tures is large, commodious,
and well lighted. Six physicians, two surgeons, an ophthalmic surgeon,
and several assistants, perform the professional duties. Visits are made
in the morning and afternoon, and clinical discourses and examinations
take place at the bedside. The institution is placed under the superin-
tendence of a director, Dr. Kluge.
The department for the insane is on the second floor, and separate
from the rest of the hospital. The number of patients averages one
hundred and fifty. As there is no ground for exercise, they do not
leave the house, and no treatment appears to be adopted, except when
other disease supervenes, or when a high state of cerebral excitement
exists. The disposition of the locale prevents the employment of moral
means. The most common varieties of alienation met with in Berlin
are melancholia and monomania, especially that relating to religious
subjects. In the female convalescent ward about thirty patients were
busy knitting or sewing.
The rooms for diseases of the eyes contain eighteen beds: there is
also daily a numerous attendance of out-patients, when Professor JUng-
ken, who enjoys a high reputation in this branch of surgery, delivers
clinical discourses. The treatment is mostly antiphlogistic and revul-
sive; internal medicines being given where the general health appears
in fault, and stimulating applications being but sparingly used. In ope-
rating for cataract, the professor does not give the preference to any
particular method for all cases, but varies his mode of operating accord-
ing to circumstan~es. During one of my visits, one patient was ope-
rated by extraction, another by reclination, in consequence of the co-
existence of abdominal disease.
Amon~ the patients was. also an _old man, with chronic entropion :
by touchmg the cent~al p~mt of skm beneath the. lower eyelids, with
concentrated sulphunc acid, for three or four mmutes, an almost in-
stantaneous rectification of the position of the previously inverted lids
was produced. In these cases, after the separation of the slough the
skin becomes contracted, while cicatrization takes place, and the be~efit
is permanent.

as the care of the greater number of surgical patients, devolving upon
Professor Diffenbach, who enjoys a high reputation as an operator,
especially in remedyin~ deformities of the face and other parts; many
patients requiring rhinoplastic ope1·ations being sent to him from a great
·distance.
During my attendance there were few surgical cases of interest, the
majority consisting of chronic ulcers, scrofulous affections, &c. In
these c::tscs, which depend upon general derangement of the system,
medicines~ as iodine, sarsaparilla, and tonics, are given, though, in the
majority of surgical diseases, the treatment is local, internal remedies
being seldom resorted to. Fractures of the Ie[!; are treated in suspended
boxes, without the employment of lateral splints. In fracture of the
thigh, the apparatus of Hagedorn is used, being applied to the sound
limb, which is thus made to serve as a splint to the fractured one. I
measured the thighs of a patient cured by this method, but the fractured
limb was considerably shorter than its fellow. I was assured, however,
that this is not in general the case, the patient having, in this instance,
walked upon the limb before consolidation was ·firmly effected. In
eases of strangulated hernia, the operation is in general immediately
performed, no time being lost in attempts at reduction and other mea.:-
sures. After these operations, bleeding, laxatives, cooling beverages,
&c., are employed according to circumstances. ·
Among the patients was a man, in whom the anus had been extirpa-
ted, in consequence of carcinomatous disease, which appeared to have
been effectually removed, but the patient was unable to retain the f::eces.
Another patient had an attack of phlegmonous erysipelas, with suppu-
ration in the leg and thigh, from an incised wound of the knee. The
treatment was, in the first instance, venesection, the repeated application
of leeches on the limb, nitrated potions, with an occasional purgative ·
and, subsequently, by incisions, to allow the escape of matter, and pre:
vent destruction of the skin ; tepid saturnine fomentations beina- applied
to the limb: _tonics were not given, as the skin continued hot~and the
pulse \vas not particularly feeble. I did not see the termination of this
case. There were also in the house a case of hydrocele, that had been
treated by incision-this method being always preferred to injection:
a patient, with fracture of the ribs, treated by the application of a blad-
der of ice to the part; bandaging the thorax is not employed. This
patient had been bled two or tlwee times; but 1 was informed that
bleeding is not in general requisite in similar cases, as the ice is suffi-
cient to-prevent the occurrence of severe inflammation.
The syphilitic wards are pbced at the top of the house, because while
under treatment, patients are not allo\\1ed to leave, nor are thei1
• friends
permitted to visit them. They are cle~n and well-ventilated contain-
ing fifty beds for women, and thirty for men. The treatm~nt differs
from that in use elsl!where, and consists principally in rirrid abstinence:
bread, soup, and milk are the only articles of food al~wecl ; and of
th<:'se each patient receives only a quarter of the ordinary portion given
to the other patients. J\lercury is never employed ; the usual I'emedies
being solution of the neutral salts, especially sulphate of magnesia, and
so GERMAN MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.
sarsaparilla. \Vhere mercury had been given previous to the r.atie.nt's
admission, sulphur is administered for a few days. The apphcatwns
to sores are emollient, slightly stimulating, or caustic, according to cir-
cumstances. The usual duration of the treatment is from three to four
weeks : it is seldom that secondary symptoms make their arpearance,
and when they occur they are not of a serious nature. I did not ob-
serve any of those deformities of the face so commonly seen in similar
institutions, nor more than three or four cases with cutaneous eruption;
• -in fact, most of the patients appeared to be in a thriving condition,
notwithstanding their meagre diet.
Bad cases, with patients in a debilitated cachectic condition, are oc-
casionally sent in from the country: in these instances nourishing diet
and tonics are prescribed till the patient regains strength, after which
the ordinary plan is pursued. Urethral inflammation is treated by
antiphlogistics and abstinence ; and when in a chronic state, by copaiba,
cubebs, &c.

are Dr. Wolf and Dr. Bartels. The most prevalent diseases at Berlin
are, in spring and autumn, intermittents, catarrhal affections, and rheu-
matism ; in summer, typhus fever, gastric and intestinal irritation ; and
in winter, thoracic and tracheal inflammations. Scrofula, and nervous
diseases, especially delirium tremens, are exceedingly common.
The following is a brief sketch of the method of treatment most
frequently adopted.-In pulmonic and bronchial inflammation, moder-
ate bleeding, diaphoretics, especially antimony, solution of nitrate of
potass, in decoction of marsh mallows, or other demulcent mixture: in
the less severe cases, blisters, diaphoretics, and expectorants, are the
remedies mostly resorted to : the hydrochlorate of ammonia is much
used, especially in the more chronic cases and in catarrhal affections, as
are antimonials, squills, and other stimulating expectorants.
In abdominal inflammation, after bleeding and leeches, mild purga-
tives, as calomel and castor oil, are generally employed : drastics are
seldom given except in ophthalmic cases : lavements and baths are not
so freely used in acute disease as in Franee. Venesection is not often
practised in typhus fevers, which are generally treated by leeches ap-
plied wherever pai~ is comp!ained of, by I?ild diaphoretics, calomel in
large doses, castor oil, and mixtures contaming muriatic acid : in the
advanced periods of the disease, musk, camphor, carbonate of ammonia
blisters, and ~inapisms, are t~e re.medies most in' request; bark is no~
frequently given. In gastnc disorder, emetics, laxatives the hydro-
chlorate of ammonia, are frequently given : calomel and'small doses
of neutral salts, are also prescribed when hepatic dera~rrement co-exists.
Acute rheumatism is treated by venesection, emeti~s laxatives dia-
phoretics:' and colchicum ;_blisters are frequently appliel to the aff~cted
parts, which are at other hmes enveloped 111 tow, to preserve an uniform
degree ?f warmth ~nd m~isture. lntermittents are generally treated
by emetics or purgative~, \~tth ?ydrochlorate of ammonia and cinchona.
In scrofulous cases, wdme 1s more used than formerly : tonics, ba-
rytes, salt baths, and malt baths, are also very generally employed. In
GERMA~ M~DICAL I~STITUTIO~S. $1
nervous affections, emetics, purgatives, anti-spasmodics, aud the sho.wer
bath, are mostly" used. Delirium tremens is treated by bleeding and
purgatives, or by opium and stimulants, according to circumstances.
Inflammatory attacks, in weak persons, are treated by local abstractio,n
of blood, blisters, calomel in small doses, cii~italis, &c.
The Clinical Hospital for Surgery and Diseases of the Eyes, is a
neat building, containing forty beds, and a small theatre for le>ctures
and operations. Tt is under the direction of Dr. Graefe, the surgeon :
tvvo assistants reside in the house. Patients who are in a condition to.
p3y for their support, are required to do so ; but paupers receive gra-
tuitous assistance. At the time of my v1sit, but few patients were in
the house, it being near vacation-time. Among them was one who
had underp;one the operation for femoral hernia ; blee,ding, the warm
bath, and the taxis, had been previously employed. After the opera-
tion, the patient was bled, took some castor-oil, and was going on
favourably. Lithotrity was performed, while I was present, by Dr.
Graefe, who employed Ch:1rriere's instrument for breakinp; the calculus,
which after some difficulty was seized, and being of a friable nature,
was easily broken.
Not much medicine is given in the treatment of diseases of the eyes,
the abstraction of blood, counter-irritation, occasional purgation, and
emollient or stimulating collyria, are the remedies mostly employed.
An ointment, or strong solution of nitrate of silver, in the proportion
recommended by Mr. Guthrie, has lately been much used at this hos-
pital in conjunctival inflammation.
According to the published statement, in the year 1833, one thou-
sand aml forty-six patients, with surgical disease, were treated. Of
these, eight hundred and thirty-one were cured, twenty died. Of four
hundred and seventy-eight patients, with diseases of the eyes, three
hundred and eighty-six were cured. The number of operations, inclu-
(ling cauterization, vaccination, and other minor operations, was three
hundred aud seventy-five; the cures, one hundred and eighty-four.
The number of deaths is not given.
T~lC University is a large and handsome building, three stories high,
consisting of a central and two lateral portions, which form three ~ides
of a quadrangle, and inclose a court-yard, separated from the street by
an iron railing. The lecture-rooms occupy the ground-floor, and are
spacious, but without ornament, the place of the lecturer being only
distin~uished by a small pulpit raised above the benches of the students.
On the first floor are the grand saloon, apartments for transacting busi-
ness, an anatomical theatre, a zoological and mineralogical museum, a
cabinet of instruments, and a prison for students.
The building also contains a rich anatomical and pathological museum,
second only to the Hunterian collection. From want of room, the pre·
parations are crowded together on tables, and are not well arranged : a
better arrangement is, however, in contemplation, and a catalogue is in
:t state of forwardness. The museum has been enriched by the addition
of the large and splendid collection of Walther, and recently by that of
Professor .l\1Gller, the superintendent, and professor of physiology to

the university. In the anatomical department, among other interesting
objects, are the collection of skulls, exhibiting the form of the head in
the different races, and the minutely-injected preparations of \Valther,
among which those illustrating the formation of bone, and a head
which took the dissector three years to prepare, will attract especial
attention. Upwards of two thousand valuable specimens are contained
in the pathological department. The collections of monstrosities, and
of the morbid anatomy of the osseous and nervous systems, are parti-
etllarly rich. Here are also the wax casts of Reil, in which the minute
anatomy of the nervous system is exposed. Adjoining this museum is
one of comparative anatomy, which contains an extensive osteological
collection of the different classes of animals.
From the report of this year, it appears that the number of students
in the four faculties is sixteen hundred and fifty-one. Of these, four
hundred and thirty-one are not Prnssians. Three hundred and fifty-
eight attend the medical classes in the following order :-first year,
anatomy, physiology, botany, chemistry; second year, materia medica,
therapeutics, general and special pathology; third and fourth year, the
medical, surgical, obstetric, and ophthalmic cliniques. Each course of
lectures costs the student from two to three louis: the fees of exami-
nation amount to about twenty-five louis, and the whole expense of
professional education to about one hundred and fifty. Candidates
have to undergo four examinations: the first is for promotion; the
second, termed the tentamen, is made by the dean, and takes place
before the period of study is terminated; the third, or rigorosum, is
made before the professors of the faculty, when each professor exam-
ines on his particular branch of education. Three or four students are
examined at a time, and the examination generally lasts upwards of
three hours. Candidates have also to write and defend a thesis in I:.atin.
After passing these ordeals, the candidate acquires the title of doctor,
which, however, does not authorize him to practice before undergoing
the last examination. Tfle title of doctor may be obtained at any of
the Prussian universities; but all candidates are obliged to repair to
Berlin for the public examination, which is divided into several parts,
and lasts several days. In the anatomical examination, the candidate
takes from a vase the name of one of the bones, of which he is required
to give a dt>scription without hesitation. In like manner, the name of
a viscus is drawn by lot, and described: a part of the body, to be dis-
secte!l and demonstrated, is also indicated in the same manner. An
anatomical description of the contents of the cranium, thorax, or abdo-
men, wi~h the rel~tiv~ position of ~he viscera, is likewise required. In
the surgical examinatiOn, t.he candtdate has to make a dissertation on a
subj~ct chosen by the professor : h~ has als? to perform operations
publtr.ly on the dead body, and desr.nbe the different steps of the ope-
ration; also to give a demonstration on the skeleton, of the method of
!reating fr~ctures and lu~ations: he has th_e treatment of two patients
In the hospttnl for a fortmght, and takes dmly notes of the cases which
are read at the examination. Candidates for the medical diplorr:a have
in like manner, the care of two hospital patients. '

Berlin also contains a royal institution where pupils unable to bear
f . . ' '
the expense o unt verstty edncation, are crratuitously supported and
instructed in the medical sciences, to qualify them for the army, where,
after their examination, they are obliged to serve a certain number of
years, without receiving any salary.
HALLE
Is a quiet tow:1, with a population of thirty thousand. Its university
was one of the earliest established in Germany, and experienced gt·eat
vicissitudes during the late war, having been at one time suppressed
altogether. When Halle was restored to Prussia, the university was
reorganized and inc01·porated with that of \Vittenberg. It now enjoys
a tolerable share of pl'Ospcrity, owing in part to the reputation of the
late Professor .:Meckel, who filled the anatomical chair, as did his father
and grandfather before him. The number of students is six hundred:
one hundred and fifty study the medical sciences. The old building has
been destroyed, and a handsome structure, of a quadrangular form, has
recently been erected, containing spacious lecture-rooms for the differ-
ent facultie~. The course of study is similar to that pursued at Berlin:
the expense is, however, less, and there are many indigent students,
especially in the theological faculty, who are supported. by government.
The chair of anatomy is now occupied. by Professor D'Alton ; that of
special therapeutics by Kmgenberg, who enjoys a high reputation.
Halle possesses one of the richest and most important anatomical
cabinets in Germany, due almost entit·ely to the exertions of the Meek-
cis. It is divided into three sections,-human, comparative, and patho-
logical anatomy, each containing curious and rare specimens. Since,
however, the death of the late professor, his widow will not allow the
collection to he visited.
Connected with the university, are an extensive library, a museum
of natural history, and a good botanical garden. The hospital is in an
airy situation, but does not contain more than forty beds, chiefly for
clinical instruction, as most of the sick poor are gratuitously visited and
relieved at their own houses. There is also a small lying-in hospital
for the obstetrical clinique.
GOTTINGEN
Is a small town, containing ten thousand inhabitants. The U niver-
sity was founded, in 1734, by George the Second, who was its first
Rector llfagnificus, ar.d the ti tie has been retained by his successors.
84 GERMAN MEDICAL 11\STITUTIONS.
C"ntil the formation of the university of Berlin, Gottingcn was consi-
dered the most flourishing of the German universities ; and even now
the number of professors amounts to ncar eightv,-that of the students
to fifteen hundred. ALout half these st~1dy la;v ;-the numbet' in the
three other faculties is pretty equally divided.
Anatomy. This branch of science, enri~hed by the immortal works
of Haller, and the talent of \Vrisberg, is now cultivated with ardour by
Professor Langenbeck, one of the most distinguished anatomists and
surgeons of Germany, who promotes the study of anatomy with inde-
fatigable zeal, rendering it at the same time extremely instructive by
jqining it with surgery. This professor has published a superb collec-
tion of anatomical plates.
Professor Langenbeck also occupies the chair of clinical surgery.
His clinique is regarded as one of the best extant; and the dexterity and
promptitude with which he operates, serve as an admirable model for
his pupils.
The chair of physiology was till lately occupied by Professor Blu-
menbach, a n~me belonging, not only to Gottingen, but to Europe. The
professor is still living, though far advanced in years. His collection is
composed of three parts ;-viz. natural history, human crania, and fos-
sil remains. Each of these divisions is rich in valuable objects. The
collection of crania has long been celebrated ; as also the fossil remains,
among which are some precious specimens found in the Hartz moun-
tains.
Among the other scientific establishments, are the library, which
with respect to its organization, is one of the first in Europe, and supe-
rior to most in modern literature ;-it contains more than three hundred
thousand volumes, and five thousand manuscripts ;-the locale is hand-
some, and the catalogue admirably arranged =-the museum of natural
history is large and well kept; the mineralogical and zoological depart-
ments are particularly rich. The observatory is one of the most cele-
brated in Europe, and the botanical garden one of the best in Germany.<(

SINCE the Rhenish provinces were ceded to Prussia, an university
has been formed at Bonn, of which that at Berlin served for the model.
Liberal donations, both of mo.ney and objects of natural history, were
made; .a muse~m and b~tamcal garden formed ; and this university

anatomical theatre has been erected in the garden, and contains a neat
amphitheatre, dissecting-rooms, and a small but well-arranged collection
of pathological anatomy.
At Poppelsdorf, about half a mile from Bonn, and connected with it
hy a public promenade, is the fine botanical garden, as also the exten-
sive and well-arranged museum of zoology and mineralogy, occupy-
ing the apartments of the chateau. The library, the cabinet of instru-
ments, and the chemical laboratory, are _
also very complete and well
organized. The present professor of midwifery is Dr. Killian, from
whose work on German univerf;ities I have made some extracts, though
great changes have taken place since its publication. vValther, who
was formerly professor of surgery, is now removed to Munich.
A few miles from Bonn is a large establishment for the treatment of
mental alienation, on the same plan as at Sonnenstein. The building,
formerly a convent, is large, forming a quadrangle, in the centre of
which is a church; and is situate on a hill, overlooking the small town
of Siegberg, and commanding an extensive prospect over the surround-
ing country. The sleeping apartments are on either side of long corri-
dors: some of them are partitioned by wooden railinf,!;s into three or
four divisions, each of which contains two beds, one for the patients,
the other for the keeper. Those patients who are violent, are not, as
at Sonnenstein, allowed to go out, but kept, either in the straight waist-
coat or in the chair of confinement in isolated cells. The rest are
occupied in walking about the spacious grounds, in digging and garden-
ing. There is a conversation-room, with piano, draught~boards, ancl
other resources, where patients assemble in bad weather. The whole
number of patients was, at the time of my visit, one hundred and
eighty ; the men in greater proportion. Sixty patients paid each from
four to six hundred dollars per annum, for which they have separate
apartments, and food of a superior quality. The generality of patients
arc not subjected to any medical treatment : sanguineous depletion,
counter-irritation, purgatives, and morphine, appear to be the remedies
most used when medical means are required. The number of admis-
sions averages from thirty to forty annually : the proportion of cures
is said to be one third. Dr. Jacobi is the superintending physician,
:J.nd resides in an adjoining house.

AN APPENDIX
ON
ANIMAL MAGNETISM AND HOM(EOPATHY.
MANY persons talk about animal magnetism and homreopathy, who
know little or nothing about them, except that they are somewhat alJied
to the marvellous, and who are inclined, perhaps on that account, to
place a reliance on their agency, which would be withheld, were it
known on what foundations rest their claims to belief.
It is my intention, in the following pages, to present a brief exposi-
tion of these subjects, comprising some account of the experiments
instituted by medical bodies and individuals, in order to exhibit to the
public the manner in which the effects ascribed to these agents were
produced ; from which it will be seen that their mode of operation is
very analogous,-their supposed action on the body being referable to
the same origin, viz. the influence exerted through the medium of the
imagination.
Although animal magnetism, which at one time attracted so large a
share of attention, has been in great measure superseded by homreo-
pathy, which, however, is also rapidly passing into disuse, even in those
German towns where it was most in request, and in Paris, since the
r~cent opinion pr~nounced upon it. by the Academic Royale de Mede-
cme,.yet ~he rel~t10n ~f ~he exper1m~nts and cases is interesting in a
physiOlogiCal pmnt of VIew, as tendmg to show the manner in which
some c~anges take place, which are often inexp~icable to the physician,
and whiCh the vulgar are frequently apt to consider as effects of mira-
culous agency ; moreover, as attempts have been made to introduce
homreopathy into this country, I have thought that some account of
it,.in connexi~n with animal mag~etism, wou)d form a not inappro-
priate Appendix to a work on contmental medical practice and would
be acceptable to those who feel interested in the matter. '
ANIMAL MAGNETIS)f. 87
ANIMAL MAGNETISM.
VARIOUS definitions of the nature of animal magnetism have been
proposed by those who have written on the subject. The best is perhaps
that which considers it to depend upon, "a certain state of the nervous
system, presenting phenomena which m:ty be caused in some persons
by the infhlence of another individual performing certain actions with
the intention of producing this state," this influence was supposed to
bear some analogy with that of the magnet upon iron : hence the term.
Animal magnetism was introduced into France from Germany, about
the middle of the last century, by an individual of the name of Mesmer,
and was during some years in high repute for the cure of certain
diseases, until it was subjected to examination, and condemned by the
Academic des Sciences and the Academic Royale de 1\'Iedecine. It
consequently lost much of the credit it had previously enjoyed, and by
degrees sank into comparative oblivion~ till within the last twenty
years, when public attention was again drawn to it; several works were
published on the subject; some physicians of professional and scien-
tific attainments declared themselves believers in its powers, and
numerous experiments were made relating to somnambulism or lucid
sleep, the phenomenon said to be most frequently observed.
At length, in 1825, 1\'I. Foissac, a magnetiser, proposed to .the
Academic de Medecine, to produce before it a somnambulist, in whom
the members of that bo-dy should witness the extraordinary phenomena
caused by animal magnetism. The proposition gave rise to violent
debates, which terminated in the appointment of a committee which
was required to give its opinion as to whether the Acaclemie ought or
ought not to take cognizance of the subject. The committee decided
in the affirmative, on the following grounds: first, that the judgment
pronounced by the Academic in 1784, was not founded upon reasons
sufficiently conclusive; and secondly, that the magnetism now proposed
for examination, differed from the l\iesmerian magnetism, inasmuch as
its effects were produced without actual contact between the magnetiser
and the magnetised, and without using metallic rods, magnetic chairs,
and other similar means.
After strong opposition a commission was appointed, composed of
twelve members of the Academic, to examine into, and report upon,
the experiments to be instituted. The commission pursued its inves-
tigation until l831, when it presented a report to the Academic,
containing an exposition of its labours, with the inference deduced
from them, arranged under the following heads.
1. The effects of magnetism are null in persons in health, and m
some invalids.
2. They are but little apparent in others.
3. They arc often produced by ennui, monotony, and the power of
the imagination.
88 ANIMAL MAGNETISM.
4. Lastly, they are developed independently of these causes, very
probably by the effect of magnetism alone.
Thus after six years of inquiry, the commissioners pronounced no
decisive opinion in their report, which, however, was not signed by
three of the most influential among them, lVI.lVL Laennec, Double, and
Magendie. The inferences under the three first heads, would have
put down altogether the pretentions of the magnetisers ; but in conse-
quence of the statement under the fourth head, and as the commissioners
declared that evei'Y precaution had been taken to prevent errors and
deception, magnetism acquired in some measure the appearance of
being under the sanction of the Academie. An account of the cases
which were the su~jects of the experiments, was published by M.
Foissac; in looking over these it will be seen that the cases which come
under the fourth head are extremely few : and in these instances so
far from every precaution having b.een taken, it appears that the com-
missioners trusted greatly to the honesty and good faith of the
magnetisers and the magnetised, between whom there is the strongest
evidence of the existence of a previous understanding.
One of the most constant effects observed to be produced is a degree
of somnolency, and sometimes actual sleep, especially when the person
has already been magnetised two or three times. It is not surprising
that this should be the case in an individual seated on a ehair before
whose face various movements are slowly made by the hand of the
magnetiser, in perfect silence during a period varying from a few
minutes to half an hour; but another state, somnambulism or lucid sleep,
is also said to be produeed; and the person in this state is termed a
somnambulist, \Yho, while under the influence of the magnetic action,
is said to be insensible to exterior objects as in natural sleep but under
the control of the magnetiser, so as to answer questions proposed, and
perform actions indicated by him.
One magnetiser, speaking of the wonders of magnetism before the
Academie, says in reference to the absolute power of the magnetiser
over the somnambulist~u If cold you can warm him, if warm cool
him; you blow away his pains, and his pains vanish ; you change his
tears to laughter, h~s sorruws to joy. Are his country, his friends
absent? yo~ caus~ ~I~n t? see them withoutseeingthem yourselt: You
can blunt h1s sensibiht_y 1f he have to undergo any cruel operation.
You transrorm water mto an,v liquid he desires, or which you deem
useful to ~1.m-you present an empty glass, he drinks, the movements
of deglutitiOn .are perforrn~d and _thirst is appeased-with nothing I
have oalrned his hunger, With nothmg I have served him UI> spJendid
dinners,." &c. &c.¥
In ordeJ.', however, t!l induce somnambulism certain actions are per-
formed by the magnetiser. These consist for the most part in what
t ed " 'TVI.Sses " I · l I · h fi
are erm r·- . , w 11~ 1 are c o~e 1? t e allowing manner; the
persons presen~ bemg req~11red to mamtam the strictest silence.
The maguetlser seated m front, and at the distance of a foot from the

p~rson to he magni.tis~d, prepares himself during a short time, placing
h1s thumbs on the ms1de of the thumbs of the person till an equal degree
of h«:>at be obtained. He next places his hands on the shoulders of the
person for about a minute, and brings them with a gentle pressure
slowly down the arms to the extremity of the fingers. This movement
is repeated five or six times. He then places his hands on the top of
the persons head, whence he gradually brings them down, an inch or
two distant from the face, to the epigastrium. These movements are
repeated during the greater part of the sitting, and are sometimes varied
by transverse passes, or movements across the face and breast at the
distance of two or three inches.
These movements are what the commissioners saw made on most of
the individuals subjected to the experimeuts, and without further proof
immediately accepted them as the causes of the phenomena they after-
wards witnessed, and as the means by which the magnetic action was
transmitted; but as M. Dubois, who was present at several of the
experiments, remarks in his critical examination of the report in the
Revue Medicale, "there is no doubt the commissioners saw the phe-
nomena they have described, but there is an enormous difference between
the facts observed and the conclusions drawn from them. They believed
the absurd, the miraculous, the wonderful; yet the circumstances as
they occurred, explain themselves rationally, either by very ordinary
physiological phenomena, or by well known pathological laws, and
sometimes by trickery (supercherie)." -
Somnambulism is, however, according to the magnetisers, merely the
precursor of effects much more wonderful, as clairvoyance or mental
vision, in which objects are seen, Hiough the eyes be closed ; the power
of predicting the occurrence of events ; that of ascertaining, while in
somn:1mbulism, the nature of the diseases in some individuals, and of
prescribing the appropriate remedies, &c. though it must be· acknow-
ledJ2;ed that not more than two or three exhibitions of this kind were
made before the commissioners, and even these failed, notwithstanding
the instructions the somnambulists must have previously received, as
will be seen in the sequel.
The somnambulist proposed to be presented to the Academie by M.
Foissac, who, he stated, would remove all doubts as to the power of
magnetism, was the first person subjected to its operation before the
commission. It appears, however, that no effect was produced in this
instance, for in the report the commissioners say," We must confess
our inexperience, our impatience, our mistrust, too strongly manifested
perhaps, did not permit us to observe any of the phenomena of som-
nambulism."
Some cases are adduced in illustration of the second and third heads,
in the report, in which the effects produced were attributable to ennui,
the power of the imagination, &c., it being sufficient to place the persons
in situations in which they believed themselves magnetised. This will,
however, readily be credited without my bringing forward instances in
proof, I shall therefore merely insert one or two of the shortest among
them,
90 ANIMAL MAGNETISM.
l\fademoiselle L . was magnetised eleven times at the H otel Dieu,
within the period of a month. At the fourth setting, somnolency, con-
vulsive movements of the neck and face, with other symptoms. At the
eleventh si~ting he1· magnetiser placed himself behind. ~1er without
making any sirrns, and without the intention of magnet1S1ng, yet she
experienced m~re decided effects than on the preceding trials.
An hysterical girl was magnetised several time~: at each .time there
occurred somnolency with strong, convulsive actwns. Be1ng placed
one day in the same chair, in the same place, at the same hour, and in
presence of the same persons, the accustomed phenomena presented
themselves, though her magnetiser was absent. A like experiment was
made on an epileptic patient and produced a similar result.
According to the magnetisers, the action of passes is not always ne-
cessary to produce magnetic effects, which may frequently be induced
by the sole will of the magnetiser, even if he be in a room separate from
the individual on whom the experiment is made. This supposed influ-
ence of the will on the magnetised, was, however, never produced at the
first settings, but only after the person had been repeatedly magnetised
in the ordinary manner. The symptoms which then took place may
consequently be attributed, as in the cases above ·stated, merely to the
effect of habit in ind~viduals on whom the same circumstances of posi-
tion, time, locality, &c. had repeatedly operated.
The following are some of the cases from which the commissioners in-
ferred that the phenomena were produced by the action of magnetism
alone.
A girl aged sixteen magnetised eight times. Somnambulism is in-
duced at the first sitting. When spoken to she does not answer, and the
noise of a heavy shutter falling does not awaken her. At the second
sitting, she ans\vers by affirmative and negative signs. At the third
sitting, she signifies that she will speak presently : she does not feel
when the skin is pinched, and does not appear to be affected by a phial
of ammonia held to the nostrils.
The next case does not answer the expectation of the magnetisers.
In a Madame C., living in the same house as her magnetiser, it
was proposed to exhibit the mental power possessed by the magnetiser
over the magnetised, as also the communication of thoughts between
them, without the intervention of speech o1· gesture; the proposal was
accepte? by t~e commissioners, who repaired to the house, and on 'som-
?an?bu~lsm bemg produced, gave directions in writing to the magnetiser,
1?dl~at1ng the actwns they desired to see performed, which were to be
s1gmfied. mentally to the somnambulist. Thus, she is first ordered to
go an? sit on ?stool before the piano; she rises and looks at the clock;
on. bemg ~pp~1sed of her mistake, she goes into another room, and on
bemg agam mformed of her error she sits down on her former seat.
~he is next request~d to raise her .hand at the same time as her magne-
tiser, and to lower 1t at the same time; the two hands are raised simul-
taneously, but that of Madame C. is lowered in a few· minutes The
back of a watch is presented to her; she mistakes the hour, a.nd the
ANIMAL MAGNETISM. 91
number of the hands; she is told to rub her forehead, but she merely
extends her hand.
The result of this, and some other cases, rendered the commissioner~
doubtfnl of the effect of animal magnetism, and not without suspicion of
a previous understanding between the magnetisers and the somnambu-
lists. A. ]\J. Dupotet offered to solve their doubts, and engaged to
produce at will, out of the sight of the somnambulist, convulsi,·e move-
ments in any part of the body, by the mere action of pointing towards
the part in which the commissioners should desire to witness these'
effects. A man who had already been magnetised several times was
somnambulised, and after some trials on his obedience, M. Dupotet an-
nounced that the commissioners might produce in him any effects they
pleased.
1\I. l\1arc, one of the commissioners, accordingly placed himself be-
hind the somnambulist, and made sign to 1\'l. Dupotet to produce move-
ments in the fore finger of his right hand, and afterwards in the toes;
the somnambulist matle some movements, but not in the parts indicated;
similar movements subsequently occurred without magnetisation, and
the experiment was declared inconclusive.
The· next experiment which I shall relate, was made to exhibit be-
fore the commissioners the faculty of mental vision, or sight with closed
eyelids, on a 1\1. Petit, in whom the result of previous trials had been
very satisfactory to the magnetiscrs. Somnambulism having been in-
duced, 1\f. Petit was requested to select a piece of money from others
held in the hand of the magnctiscr; this was cionc, the coin noted and
mixed with twelve others, and the somnambulist was desired to point
out the one he had selected; he howeYer took the wrong one. A watch
was presented to him, he mistook the hour. Other objects were also
prcsc>nted, but he could never discover immediately what they were;
he took them in his hands, felt and turned them over, brought them
ncar his eyes, and after all, generally guessed wrong; he was able to
read a few lines, while the commissioners watched that his eyelids
were closed. There is no doubt, however, that the eyes were partially
opened~ as he could not distinguish any thing when a bandage was
placed before them. Although clah·voyance had been talked of by the
magnetiscrs as a very common phenomenon of magnetism, it was only
exhibited two or three times before the commissioners, during a period
of six years, and the results were similar to those above mentioned.
The following cases are given, as cures performed by magnetism.
A law student, laboring under a paralytic affection of the limbs, was
treated by the usual means at La Charite, and at the expiration of five
months was so far recovered as to be able to get about on crutches. In
this state he was magnetised by 1\1. Foissac. In the ninth sitting com-
plete somnambulism was inuuced; he answered questions, spoke of his
disease, announced that in a month he should be able to walk about
without crutches, and prescribed for himself nux vomica, sinapisms,
and baths of Bcreges water; these being the remedies from which he
had already derived advantage. On the day he had named, the com-
m~ssion repaired to La Charite, anxious to see whether his prediction
92 ANIMAL MAGNETISM.
would be fulfilled. On being somnambulised, the patient declared that
when he awoke he should return to his bed \-Vithout crutches or other
support. 'Vhen awakened, he asked for his crutches, but was answered
that he did not require them: he arose, traversed the courts, walked
up stairs, and from that day he has never used the crutches. In subse-
quent trials he presented the phenomena of clairvoyance as completely
as M. Petit.
The next case was at the time matter of great astonishment, as illus-
strating the extraordinary power of magnetism.
A lady labored under a nervous disease, which had resisted all the
efforts directed against it; she at length became impressed with the
idea that ma~netism alone could cure her, and was accordingly magne-
tised by .l\1. Chapelain. One day she goes to J\IL ChapeJain, supporting
herself with difficulty on crutches; it was pitiable to sec her suffer.
Armed with a benevolent will, l\1. Chapelain by magnetism dispersed
the pains in the limbs, the sighings and gloomy thoughts with which
she was affected, and restored tranqui]]ity to this person, so cruelly agi-
tated an instant before. '~Are you we]]," he inquired. "0 yes, sir, I
thank you." She slept for about two hours, and on awaking walked
away, carrying ·the crutches which had suppported her on her arrival!
In the first ofthese cases it is pretty evident that the patient was already
convalescent at the time the magnetic trials were made, and could most
probably have walked without crutches, had he so chosen, as we]] at the
expiration of a week as of a month. The second is one of those cases
which so frequently puzzles the practitioner,-of the nature of which
I have offered an explanation in my work on nervous disorders, requi-
ring for their cure an exertion of the faculty of volition, which is
frequently induced by stron~ moral impressions. I have related one
or two analogous cases suddenly cured in this way, and capable of
rational explanation, without the intervention of magnetism or super-
natural agency.
I suqjoin one more of the cases brought fonvard in proof of mng-
netic influence.
A journeyman carpenter, aged twenty, subject to epileptic attacks,
was magnetised at the hospital of La Charite. Somnambulism was not
however induced till after several sittings. The patient at length an-
nounced, that on a certain day, at a certain hour, he would have an
attack. It accordingly took place at the time he had specified. When
interrop;ated, while in somnabulism, respecting his disease, he declared
that at the end of the year the attacks would cease · he also mentioned
the exact time at w.hich the two ~allowing attacks wo~ld take place. These
occurred at the time he predicted, and the fact of his cure only re-
mained to be p~·o,ved; but. before th~ expiration of the year, he was run
over by a cabriolet and lulled; a Circumstance which magnetism did
not enable him to foresee.
The profession wi!l I.lOt form any very exalted opinion of the intelli-
gence of the commiSsionei'S from the relation of these cases as i]]us-
trations of the effects produced by magnetism alone. It' is well
known that epilepsy is one of the diseases most easily simulated and
' '
A:\L\tAL MAGXETI~.711. 93
consequently, that there would be no difficulty in predicting the period
of an attack: but had the somnambulists been able to foretell the occur-
rence of diseases which cannot be simulated, as intermittents or inflam-
matory affections, the commissioners might with some reason have
brought these instances forward as a testimony of the magnetic power.
I shall conclude by extracting from the Revue 1\H~dicale the rational
conclusions of 1\1. Dubois, in his critical exposition, 'vith the conclu-
sions which terminate the report of the commission.
Conclu.siont of the Report.
1. Contact of thumbs and movements,
termed passes, are the means of relation-
ship employed to transmit magnetic action
from the magnetiser to the magnetised.
2. Magnetism acts on pero:ons of dif-
ferent age and sex.
3. Many effects appear to depend on
magnetism alone, and are not reproduced
without it.
4. The effects produced by magnetism
are varied: it agitates some, calms others;
it generally causes acceleration of the
pulse and respiration, slight convulsive
movements, somnolency, and, in a few
cases, what is called somnambulism.
5. The existence ofpeculiar characters,
proper to recognise in all cases the re-
ality of a state of somnambulism, has not
been proved.
6. It may, however, be inferred with
certainty that this state exists when it
gives rise to the developement of new
faculties, as clai1·voyance and intuitive
foresight: or when it produces great
changes in the physiological condition
of the individual, as insensibility, sud-
den increase of strength; as this effect
cannot be attributed to any other cause.
7. \Vhen the effects ofmagnetism.have
been prodnced, there is no occasion, on
subsequent trials, to have recourse to the
pa.Yses. The look of the magnetiser, his
will alone, have the same influence.
8. Changes, more or less remarkable,
are effected in the perceptions and facul-
ties of persons in whom somnambulism
has been induced.
9. \Ve have seen two somnambulists
distinguish, with closed eyes, objects
placed before them. They have read
words, estimated the difference ofcolours,
the points on cards, &c.
Rational Conclusions.
1. The passes are means employed to
transmit a pretended action to the mag-
netised.
2. Magnetism does not act on any per-
sons, whatever be the age or sex.
3. \Ve have not seen any effects that
could be attributed to magnetism : the
phenomena observed depend on other
causes.
4. There is no proof that the agitation
or calmness of the individuals, any more
than the other drcumstances, are pro-
duced by magnetism.
5. Ditto, ditto.
6. It has been impossible for us to
come to the conclusion that this state
was real; even when it gave rise to the
above mentioned phenomena, and pro-
duced insensibility and other physiologi-
cal changes, inasmuch as these effects
may be referred to other causes.
7. It has not been demonstrated that
passes have really produced any pheno-
mena, still less that the look or will of
the magnetiser has had this influence.
8. These changes in the perceptions
and faculties, which appeared to be ef-
fected in somnambulists, may be referred
to other causes than magnetism.
9. \Ve have seen two somnambulists,
capable, as it was said, of reading, &c.
with closed eyes, but it has not been
proved to our satisfaction that the edges
of the eyelids 'vere at all times in imme-
diate contact.
10. In two somnambulists, we have 10. \Ve have seen two somnambulists
met with the faculty of foreseeinG' acts capable, as it was said, of foreseeing acts
of the organism to take place at p~riods of the organism; but one predicted at-

Conclusions of the RepoN.
more or less distant. One announced
the day, hour, and minute of the invasion
and recurrence of an epileptic attack: the
other foresaw the period of his cure.
Their anticipations were realized.
11. We have only seen in one instance
a somnambulist, who had desr.ribed the
symptoms of the diseases in three indi-
viduals presented to her.
12. In order to establish justly the re-
lations of magnetism with therapeutics,
one must have obsen·ed the effects on a
number of individuals, and have made
many experiments on sick persons. This
not having been done, the commissioners
can only say, they have seen too few
cases to ena-ble them to give a decisive
opinion.
13. Considered as an agent of physio-
logical phenomena, or of therapeutics,
magnetism should find a place in the cir-
cle of medical science, and consequently,
should be either practised, or its employ-
ment superintended by a physician.
14. The commission could not verify,
because it had not opportunities, the ex-
istence of any other faculties in somnam-
bulists; but it communicates, in its re-
port, facts sufficiently important to state,
that in its opinion, the Acedemie ought
to encourage researches on animal mag-
netism as a eurious branch ofpsychology
and natural history.
Rational Conclusions.
tacks of a disease that may be simulated;
the other announced the period of his
cure when already in full convalescence.
11. \Ve have seen a somnambulist
endowed, it· was said, with the faculty
of ascertaining the disease under which
persons presented to her laboured; but
in the first case, she only mentioned in-
significant symptoms: in the other two
cases, all the circumstanceS show that
she had received her infonnation befom
hand.
12. There are no relations to be es-
tablished between magnetism and thera-
peutics, because the pretended magnetic
effects have been absolutely null: and it
is not- from the small number of cases,
but on account of their nullity, that the
commissioners cannot determine.
13. Magnetism cannot be considered
as an agent of physiological phenomena,
still less as a therapeutic measure: it,
consequently, ought not to have a place
in the circle of medical knowledge, and,
far from recommending its employment,
physicians ought to oppose themselves
to the charlatanism which seeks to spread
it abroad.
14. The commission could not per-
ceive, because it had no opportunity, so
many other faculties said to exist in
somnambulists ; but it comm•Jnicates
facts, important enough to determine the
Academie to abstain from encouraging
researches on magnetism, as·it could not
constitute, as some believe, a curious.
branch of psychology and natural history.
95
HO.I\HEOPATHY.
'I'ms doctrine \Vas fm;t promulgated about thirty years ago, though
it did not attract much attention till within the last few years. It
originated with Dr. Hahnemann, a native of Saxony, who after having
resided in various parts of Germany, at length took up his abode in
Leipzic, and instituted experiments on the action of medicinal sub-
stances upon himself and others. Having in l7DO taken some bark,
vvhich produced, as he states, paroxysms of intermittent fever, he was
struck with the circumstance that the substance employed for the cure ,
of intermittents should occasion a similar disease in a healthy person.
This led to the inference that substances which produce certain symp-
toms in healthy inuividuals can remove these symptoms when induced
by other causes ; hence a fundamental point of the doctrine, that dis-
eases are cured only by medicines which have the power of causing
similar diseases in healthy persons: Similia similibus cm·entur.
Ilomreopathists consequently do not consider a knowledge of ana-
tomy, phys.iology, or pathology, as contributing to the cure of disease,
but restrict themselves to noting the different groups of symptoms in
diseases, and to ascertaining the appropriate remedy, without regard to
the organic changes, or other circumstances, by which the symptoms
are caused, or whether they affect the nervous, vascular, or other sys-
tems. For example, in following the rules of homreopathy, if a person
have headache, whether arising from exhaustion, inflammation, or
stomach derangement, the s:1me remedy should be had recourse to, and
that remedy must be a substance capable of causing headache in a hen.lthy
individual.
:Medical doctrines are divided by Hahnemann into the allopathic, or
method in general use, of curing diseases by remedies of an oppo~ite
nature-cont1·aria contrariis,-the antipathic, or palliative method,
and the homreopathic, the only true method; the principles of which
are contained in his E.1:position de la Doctrine JJ!Iedicale homreopa-
thique. This work eontains·an abundance of absutd reasoning, of ex-
travagant and unfounded assertions; of some truisms, from which
erroneous conclusions are drawn; of exceptions to general principles;
and isolated examples, extracted from various authors, and adduced as
the principles themselves, in order to corroborate the positions laid
down by the author. Thus to prove that many of the cures hitherto -
effected have been so by the chance employment of homreopathic means,
several instances are brought forward, among which are, that rose-water
cures ophthalmy only because it has the power of causing a kind of
ophthalmy. In like manner bark cures intermittents, he;'!ause it occa-
sions these diseases:· ipecacuanha arrests fluxions of blood, only because
it possesses the faculty of exciting hcemorrhage; generous \Vines, in
96 HO,\HEOPATHY.
small doses, cure homccopathically inflammatory fever; hyoscyamus
could not cure spasms resembling epilepsy, if it had not the power of
exciting convulsions; the same remedy could not have cured a case of
mania from jealousy, if it did not occasion mania and jealousy in healthy
individuals.
Again, the popular customs of using snow to frost-bitten parts, of
putting a scalded hand near the fire, are adduced to prove the homre-
opathic nature of the remedies to these accidents; vaccine is considered
to act hommopathically in preventing small-pox, &c. These examples
will suffice to show that the style of argument adopted is opposed to
established truths; for who ever heard ofrose-water causing ophthalmy,
of hark causing intermittents, of ipecacuanha exciting hremorrhage, or
being employed to arrest it, of generous wines curing inflammatory
fever, of hyoscyamus determining cOiwulsions, mania, and jealousy?
If snow is used to frost-bitten parts, it is used with friction, in order, as
is well known, to bring the parts gradually to their natural state;
whereas, if used on hommopathic principles, it would be kept constantly
applied; and, as may be imagined, with a certainty of aggravating the
e\·il. So also with respect to the application of heat to scalded parts;
and to prove vaccine an homceopathic .agent, it should be shown that
it has the power to cure sma-ll-pox when already existing; which in-
deed it is asserted it would do, were it not surpassed by .the small-pox
in intensity.
:Medicines, then, are not considered by the homreopathists as direct
remedies, but to act by giving rise to morbid symptoms, surpassing in
intensity those of the disease against 'vhich they are employed; on the
principle that two similar diseases cannot coexist in the same individual:
the original disease consequently yields, being overpowered by the ar-
tificial disease caused by the remedies; and this, on the discontinuance
of the medicines, is in its turn speedily overcome by the powers of the
constitution. The particular symptoms to which each medicinal substance
gives rise, and against which it is to be employed, are to be ascertained
by experiments made by the hom~opathist upon himself or other
healthy persons.
But it must not be supposed that these surprising effects are produced
by the ~unce, drachm, or grain doses employed by ordinary practitioners.
Accordmg to Hahnemann, the effects of medicinal substances are two-
fold, viz: primitive, as t~e violent .action produced by large quantities
of c~rt~m dr~gs; put·gatiOn, sweatmg, &c.; and secondary, or homcco-
pathtc, .In wh1ch tl:,e action i.s determined towards the diseased part;
th~ active properties beco.mmg more developed in proportion to the
mmut~ness of th~ ?~se: In fact, h~n:reopathis1s are cautioned against
too. mmute a .su bdt.vtston of the medtcme, lest it should become so ener-
getic as to gtve nse to dangerous symptoms. I cannot, however, do
better than extract one or two passages from the Exposition in order
to illustrate this position. '
. "J?.esides, the hot"?reopathic medicament acquires at each division or
~!dutton an e~traordmary degree of J?OWer by the friction or the shock

HO~f(EOPATHY. 97
cines, unknown before me, and which is so energetic, that of late,
experience has obliged me to shake only twice, whereas formerly I
prescribed ten shakes to each dilution."
"Gold, silver, platina, charcoal, are without action on man in their
ordinary state, but from the continued trituration of a grain of gold
with an hundred grains of powdered sugar, there results a preparation
which has already great medicinal virtue. If a grain of this mixture
be taken and triturated with another hundred grains of sugar, and if this
process he continued until each grain of the ultimate preparation con-
tains a quadrillionth part of the grain of gold, we shall then have a
medicament in which the medicinal virtue of the gold is so much
developed, that it will he sufficient to take a grain, place it in a phial,
and cause the air from it to be breathed for a few instants by a
melancholy individual, in whom the disgust of life is carried so far as
to incline to suicide, in order that, an hour afterwards, this person be
delivered from his evil demon, and restored to his taste for life."
The only division of diseases by Hahnemann is into acute and
chronic; of the former but little is said in the Exposition ; although
they may arise from exterior causes, as cold, excesses, &c., yet in many
cases they depend upon a psoric affection, and almost all chronic dis-
eases originate from sycosis, syphilis, or psora ( vulgo, itch.) This latter
especially is the cause of innumerable diseases, which great truth it
took I-Iahnemann twelve years to find out. In mentioning some of the
evils produced hy this miasm, I quote his own words: "This is the
only fundamental and exciting cause of all the morbid forms which,
under the names of nervous weakness, hysteria, hypochondriasis, mania,
melancholia, epilepsy, spasms of all kinds, rickets, caries;cancer, gout,
h:emorrhoids, jaundice, dropsy, amenorrhcea, hemoptysis, asthma, and
suppu1·atian of the lungs, ste1·ility, deafness, cataract. and amaurosis,
gravel, palsy, pains of all kinds, &c., figure in pathology as so many
separate diseases, distinct and independent one from the other."
The modifications this miasm has undergone in its passage through
millions of human constitutions, during several hundred generations,
explain how it can assume so many forms.
In the treatment of cases, the precaution has been taken hy the ho~
mreopathists of regulating with extreme care the diet of their patients.
Abstinence from every thing of a stimulating nature, as condiments,
coffee, &c., is recommended; even the smelling of delicate perfumes
is prohibited, although the smoking of tobacco is allowed; which, con-
sidering Germany is the country whence homceopathy originated, is an
extremely politic measure.
The absurdity of a doctrine equally opposed to reason and every-day
experience, could not fail to be immediately apparent to the rr.edical
profession, as well as the injurious effects that might arise from its pro-
fessors being allowed to practise on the credulity of the public, ever
ready to be attracted by novelty, especially if it be clothed in the garb
of unintelligibility and mystery. ln order, therefore, to show the
value of the pretensions of homreopathy, the experiment was made in
Germany, Russia, Franc-e, and Italy, of treating a certain number o£
9"'
•
•
98 HOM<EOPATHY.
patients in public institutions by homreopathic means, and an eq ual
number by the usual methods; the results are such as might have been
anticipated.
A German homreopathist, practising in Russia, was invested by the
Grand Duke 1\'Iichael with full powers to prove, if possible, by a com-
parison of facts, the advantages of homreopathic measures over the
ordinary modes of treatment; rtnd a certain number of patients in the
wards of a military hospital were entrusted to his care. At the
expiration of two months, however, he was not permitted to proceed
further; for, in comparing results, it was seen that within this period,
of four hundred and fifty-seven patients treated by the ordinary means,
three hundred and sixty-four, or three-fourths, were cured, and none
died; whereas, by the homreopathic method, tried on one hundred and
twenty-eight patients, one half only were cured, and five had died.
In order to ascertain, and give publicity to the results, the Russian
Government caused a certain number of patients to be treated homce-
opathically in one hospital, while in another an equal number of
patients were merely subjected to low diet and appropriate regimen,
without the exhibition of any medicine. The results were very simi-
lar in both instances, and the medical council, appointed to superin-
tend the experiments, thus gives its official opinion~
"The medical council, after having attentively weighed the results
of the experiments made according to the homreopathic method, and
compared them with those made according to the pJ·inciples of the
medecine expectante, finds that they greatly resemble the latter, and are
probably based only on the vis medicatrix naturce; for the infinitely
minute doses can produce no effect on the human body. The medical
council is therefore of opinion that the homreopathic practice should be
prohibited in sanitory establishments dependent on government, for the
following reasons :
" 1. Acute diseases require energetic means of treatment which are
not to be expected from homreopathy.
"2. The homreopathic treatment of exten1al lesions and surgical
diseases, is altogether out of the question.
"3. Some slight affections get well while under hpmreopathic treat-
ment, but similar affections disappear equally well, without any medical
treat~ent, by the adoption of an appropriate regimen, good air, and
cleanliness."
The experiments made in Paris to show how far homreopa1hy had
claims to public confidence, also tend to prove that, where any effects are
produced, they are to be ascribed to the influence of the ima(Tination.
1._ Sever~) _medical stud~nts at the Hotel Dieu_
, chosen by abhomceo·
pathiC physiCian, were subJected to the homreopathic regimen, and took
at first one, t~en two? ~hen ten, and at last eighty globules at a dose, of
~he m?st active med1c_mes prepared by the only homreopathic chemist
m Pans. In not one •_nstance was !he ~lightest effect produced.
2.. A number of pills, .made With. mert substance·s, as flour, gum
arabic, and starch, were given to patients who believed them to be
~lomreopathic remedies. I subjoin two or three of the results obtained.
HOM<EOPATHY. 99
Aphonia, of six weeks duration, cured in a few hours hy starch pills
given lwmreopatldcal!y. A girl, aged twenty, was arlmitted on the
4th January, with eomplete loss of voice, which had existed since the
middle of November. She had experienced a similar attaek the pre-
ceding year, but had recovered in fifteen days. Menstruation \Vas
rcgulady performed ; a fe,v days rest, and the usual hospital regimen,
produced no effect; she was consequently placed in the department
where the homccopathic experiments were made, and was ordered two
starch pills; the first to be taken in the presence of the physir.ian, the
next when four hours had elapsed. A fP.w minutes after the first pill
had been s\vallowed, the following symptoms manifested themselves-
anxiety, pain and uneasiness in the region of the heart and thorax,
perspiration, with heat and eruption on the skin. The second pill
appeared to aggravate these symptoms, with the addition of hiccough.
She afterwards fell asleep, and on awaking, was astonished to find she
could talk in a loud tone. The complaint did not recur, and she soon
quitted the hospital. This case is of a similar nature with that which
I related a few pages back, where the patient so speedily recovered the
use of he1· limbs after having been magnetised.
A man, aged forty, was admitted about the same time as the prece-
ding patient, complaining of a sense of oppression on the chest. He had
experienced an attack of hemoptysis a year before, and was exceedingly
hypochondriacal. During the first few days no treatment was adopted,
and he continued in the same state. Four starch pills, which he supposed
to be homreopathic remedies, were then prescribed; one to be taken
regularly every six hours. Half an hour after swallowing each pill,
the patient experienced anxiety, sense of oppression, spitting of blood.
The pills were discontinued, and resumed on alternate days during a
fortnight. Each time they were taken, they were followed by oppres~
sion, headache, acceleration of pulse, diuresis, and pains in all the limbs.
A girl, aged twenty-three, labouring under cough with hectic fever,
and insomnia, was also treated by these inert pills, which she imagined
to be homccopathic. Each time, after taking a pill, the fever diminished,
the cough was less fatiguing, and she slept better; she suffered more
when she did not take it, and always requested to have her" calming
pill."
The following ease occurred to a physician at St. Petersburgh. "A
lady, aged fo.rty-eight, phthisical, had been treated by the homreopathie
method during two years, when I became her physician ; and as my
efforts were unsuccessful~ she requested me to treat her homreopathically.
I consented, and gave her two grains of sugar, assuring her she would
experience the effects of this powerful medicine for six days. The
following day she received me with an ironical smile~ saying, "One
may easily sec, doctor, that you are not accustomed to handle homreo-
pathic remedies: that which you gave me was too energetic; it caused
so much disturbance, that I did not expect to outlive the night; however,
its action is in the end salutary, for I have not felt myself so well for a
long time as I feel to-day."
Two physicians attached to an hospital experimented upon the
100 HOM<EOPATHY.
injirmiers, or male attendants in their' wards. One physician desired
his injir1niers to note down every half hour the sensatiOns th:y expe-
rienced, after taking what they supposerl to be a homreopath1~ ag~nt.
They all experienced various sensations, of which the followmg 1s a
specimen: .
A young man in perfect health took eight pills, containing a minute
portion of charcoal, and at the expiration of half an hour had noted the
following symptoms : headache, confusion, imperfect vision; flushing
of the face. On repeating the dose, the same symptoms recurred, with
violent perspiration.
The other physician conducted his experiments differently: he took
every morning six homreopathic pills, and at the end of a certain period,
asked his infirmiers if they \vere willing to do the same; they· con-
sented, and did not experience the slightest effect.
Thus, in the first experiment, the indh·iduals expecting to experience
extraordinary sensations, from being required to note them down, do
not fail to feel some, as would be the case with most persons under
similar circumstances. On the other hand, those who saw no effect
produced on their superior by the pills, also take them, and not
expecting any particular sensations, do not experience any.
I might adduce various other examples, but being desirous not to
extend this article, I shall content myself with briefly alluding to the
experiments of lVI. Andral at La Pitie.
An hundred and thirty individuals were treated by homreopathic
remedies in the presence of numerous witnesses. The regimen recom-
mended by Hahnemann was strictly adhered to, and the prescriptions
prepared by a homreopathic chemist. The experiments were of two
kinds; first, to ascertain whether symptoms can be produced in healthy
persons by medicines which cure similar symptoms when arising from
other causes. 13ark was one of the first substances chosen, and its
various preparations were taken by M. Andral and ten other persons,
at first in homreopathic doses, which produced no effect; then in ordi-
nary doses, which were gradually increased up to from six to twenty-
four grains of stJlphate of quinine per day. None of these persons
experienced the least symptom of an attack of intermittent fever; the
only effects produced by these large doses were slight indisposition
and headache, in some whose stomachs were not so strong as the rest.
Aconitum, which, according to the homreopathists, is of superior
efficacy to blood-letting in febriJe diseases, was tried, and produced no
effect. Sulphur was also tried, by several persons without any eruption
being produced on the skin. ' ·
Thus the statement that remedies cause diseases resembling those
which they cure, .is an assertio~ utterly groundless.
The second lcmd of expenments was made to ascertain whether
homreopathic remedi.es wo~ld in any case affect the prog1·ess of disease.
Several cases of lflterm1ttent fever were treated homreopathically.
Some ~~t well at the end of a certain period, which would in all
probabd1ty ha,·c. been the rase, had no remedies been employed : in
other cases no efiect was produced, and on the usual method of treat-
HOMillOPATHY. 101
ment being adopted, the patients got rapidly well. Similar results
were obtained in treating febrile diseases, and several chronic complaints,
except that in some cases the patients got worse while under the
homceopathic system.
The homceopathists in Paris having petitioned the Minister of the
Interior to permit the establishment of dispensaries for the treatment
of patients by the homceopathic method, the minister requested the
opinion of the Academic de Medecine on the subject. The reply of
that body is made in the following terms:-
" l\'loNSIEUR LE MINISTRE ;
"Homceopathy, which presents itself to you at the present time as. a
novelty, is not a new thing. For more than twenty-five years tlus
doctrine has wandered here and there ;-first in Germany, then in
Prussia, afterwards in Italy, and now in France; seeking every where,
though in vain, to introduce itself as a branch of medicine.
"The time of the Academie has been repeatedly taken up with the
subject, and, moreover, there are but few of its members who have not
sought to ascertain its basis, and its effects.
"\Vith us, as elsewhere, homceopathy has been subjected, in the first
place, to .logical examination, which has exhibited in it a formal
opposition t~ the best-established truths, a great number of striking
contradictions, and many of those palpable absurdities which inevitably
ruin all false systems in the opinion of enlightened persons, but which
are not always a sufficient obstacle to the credulity of the multitude.
"\Vith us, as elsewhere, homceopathy has also been subjected to the
trial of facts, and put to the test of experience. Observation, faithfully ·
interrogated, has furnished the most categorical answers; for if it be
admitted that some examples of cure have occurred while under the
homceopathic treatment, it has been ascertained that the success is justly
attributable to the bias of a weak imagination on the one hand, and to
the remedial powers of the constitution on the other. Observation has
also shown the great danger of homceopathy in frequent and serious
cases of disease, where the physician may do as much harm, and cause
no less injury, by inactive measures, as by those which are directly
prejudici:tl.
"Reason and experience are consequently united to repel a similar
doctrine, and counsel that it should be left to itself and its own re-
sources.
"If the precedent were once established, application would be made
for dispensaries for 1\tfesmerism, animal magnetism, Brownism, and
other conceptions of a heated imagination. ·
"From these considerations and motives, the Academic opines that
government should refuse to entertain the petition which has been
addressed to it in favour of homceopathy."
HaYing heard of the existence of a homceopathic hospital at Leipzic,
the head-quarters of the doctrine, I had the curiosity to visit it during
my brief sojourn in that city, last July, and was directed to a small
house in one of the suburbs, with an inscription on the outside denoting
102 HOM<EOPATHY.
its destination. I had no difficulty in obtaining admission, and waJ
accompanied through the house by the assistant homceopathist, the
principal being in the country.
From what I had previously heard, I expected to see at least from
thirty to forty beds, occupied by patients, and \'\'as somewhat surprised
to find that the house only contained eight, of which but one was ocru-
pied by a phthisical patient, who had been there several months without
any amelioration. There were, however, five other patients, able to
get about, viz. a case of chronic swelling of the foot; one of delirium
-tremens, which had also bren a long time under treatment by arnica
and hyoscyamus, in doses of the decillionth part of a grain, which I was
gravely assured produced sound sleep; a young girl, with no other
complaint than deranged menstruation, who had also been some months
in the house; a case of necrosis of the tibia, treated by the internal ex.
hibition of homreopathic remedies; and a woman, with a cutaneous
disease, of a syphilitic nature, who had been treated with sulphur, car·
bon, gold, and other homreopathic remedies, since the month of Feb·
ruary, but with little advantage, as the disease appeared to me likely to
be interminable under a similar system.
During my visit two or three out-patients presented themselves. One
ofthese was a healthy boy,with tinea capitis,for which he had been taking
homreopathic globules since February, the hair having been allowed to
grow, and no external application having been used. The appearance
of the patient's head did not afford any favourable evidence of the good
effects of the treatment, and I should imagine the disease was much in
the same state as when he first applied for relief. It would be super·
tluous to lengthen this Appendix by any further observations, enough
having been stated to enable those who have perused it to form a pretty
correct estimate of the value to be set upon animal magnetism and. ho·
mceopathy. ·
