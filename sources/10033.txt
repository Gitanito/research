While changing a light bulb in the toilet, I was later informed that I had suffered a severe electric shock of two hundred and forty volts. I was informed that due to the electrocution; I had fallen of the ladder, and had hit my head on the toilet bowl. I believe I actually left my body in the toilet. However, I did follow it to the hospital and watched in awe, as my body lay limp, while ambulance officers and doctors attempted to revive me. I was aware of other 'spirits' around me. Some were grey in color, while others were transparent like myself.

After ten minutes, I was pronounced dead by the doctors, it was however thirty minutes later, according to the records that I 'recovered'.

Background Information:

Gender:	 Male

  NDE Elements:

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Yes         I was electrocuted and suffered severe concussion, which actually cracked my skull open.

Did you feel separated from your body?    Yes  I was transparent, but I knew I was there, because I was able to feel things and was aware of my surroundings because of this. However, it became quite apparent that whatever I was touching could not feel me.

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?       Non-existent.

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.    I was not aware of any noises.

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?       No

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?       Yes     I didn't communicate to them, I was merely aware of their presence.

Did you see an unearthly light?       No

What emotions did you feel during the experience?       I felt at ease, and was never aware of time. I felt that I was not obliged to do anything, as I was in oneness with myself. I was not at all confined by worldly constraints - such as inability to fly or pass through immovable, stationary objects.

Did scenes from your past come back to you?       My past flashed before me, out of my control     I did not learn anything, I simply believe I was in a state of limbo or transition.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       Yes     I became a homosexual.  
   
  After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      No

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     No

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No
