  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  I felt that my spirit goes out and I saw the surgeon and druggist doctor. Then I met my past brother. I asked him is this the death? Then I saw my mother she was far away from me. She died in 1993 she did not talk to me. I saw daughters of my brother. They ignored me in spite of my great love to them.
