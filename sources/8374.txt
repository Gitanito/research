  		              		Experience Description   

    I was 7 years old, and  lived in a farm town in the interior of the Dominican Republic   Somehow, I contracted and an invasive and aggressive Streptococcus infection that invaded my body.  I got very ill  and fainted. My father took me to the doctor, and I was transported immediately to Santo Domingo to be hospitalized.    They place me in an oxygen chamber for six months, and gave me strong antibiotics because  I was dying. They also sent a blood sample to Atlanta Georgia for diagnosis.

  I remember having an out of  my body experience.  I was in the clouds and some ANGELS took me to heaven. A huge man, dressed in White, ask me what I was doing there. I told him that I didn't know. He informed  me that I couldn't be there. Then he  took me by the hands and place me in the Top of a Huge Rainbow and push me downwards.  I came down the rainbow, almost reaching earth. Then I saw my father worriedly  talking to someone about me. Then I came down from the ceiling, into my body.

  The labratory in Atlanta identified the strain and I received the correct treatment. I felt much better and  returned Home.

  ---------------------------

  Saturday, November 3, 2001:

  I left my job and arrived home. I decided to put on new clothes and go for a test drive after installing a new engine. I went to the gas station to fill up the gas tank and get some food.  And while I was at it, I bought  a beer. Then I went bar hopping to the discos and at each one continued to drink.  

  I remember someone telling me not to drive because  I was drunk. I drove anyway.  I didn't see the two vehicles that came from behind. I accelerated without looking and collided with a protective wall of a bridge.

  Everything turned black.  I was in a beautiful place surrounded by stars. I had no pain,  hunger, or anxiety. I only felt peace and comfort. I was surrounded by stars and could have stayed in that place forever.   I remember looking at all the billions and billions of stars. I looked at myself and I was a star too. At that moment, I heard a soft voice telling  me, 'It is not your time yet.'  I remember feeling as if I had been thrown from a distance into my body. 

  I woke up on a gurney in a hallway, to the stench of blood and terrible pains all over my body.  A doctor was passing  by me so  I asked him to help me. They treated and stabilized me.
  
  My parents and some neighbors went to the hospital and found me.  Later, they told me that at first they could not find me because I was not registered with my name, but under the name of 'Angel.'

  In one of the many surgeries I  had, I had an anesthetic crisis and was dying. My body failed and I felt that I was dying.  I saw an intense white light. I was making great efforts to breathe, then I remembered that if I died, I would surely reach the beautiful place full of stars. So I stopped fighting to breathe but the doctors saved my life. I breathed again and opened my eyes, frustrated because I could not die.

  This happened to me again in another surgery room, as I have had several major surgeries to be able to walk.

  During recovery, the accident left me greatly distressed. I had taken a great blow to the right frontal lobe in the accident. I needed to see a psychiatrist  several times to the Psychiatrist because there were unsual things happening to me.    I did not tell anyone, but I saw ghosts, I had extra-sensory experiences with elements of other dimensions. I saw lights that covered my bed and my room.  At first it was very annoying and uncomfortable. These ghosts  had elements that looked like shadows and others looked like flashes of light. 

  Until I got used to my new reality,  I heard voices within me.  I also  saw shadows and lights, in the form of corporeal, semi corporeal manifestations. I would talk to them and they would tell me very different and strange stories.

  I know very well that human life is more complex than what we know and that the human being has a component of spiritual  make up, which is more complex than we know.
