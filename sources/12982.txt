  		              		Experience Description   

    I am not certain if these experiences are NDEs or not.  

  In 1962, when I was an infant, my three older siblings stuffed my mouth and nose with raisins.  I have no memory of an experience. But in the 1980s and 1990s, when I read about NDEs, I realized I have the personality of an NDEer.
  
  In 1999, at age 37, I had surgery for a ruptured appendix.  I might have had a life review.  It was as if I was in a graphic novel where  I was crashing through one picture and into another by going through the walls of each picture.  I was out of my body and  speedily traveling through the hallways of the hospital. Yet,  no one noticed me.
