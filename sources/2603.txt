If a number of persons were viewing a large diamond

to name its color, each might give a different answer.
One might say it was red. Another might say it was blue,
another green or orange or yellow or any other color.
They might each check the report of their senses with a

of differentiation.

WHY ARE WE HERE?
The Problem:
The origin and destiny of man is one of the greatest
philosophical problems that has occupied the mind of man.
And it has occupied the finest minds of all races through-
out all ages. And it still is one of the most important
problems for mankind to understand; for without some
comprehension of why we find ourselves occupying a.
physical body and manifesting here on Earth, and ap-
parently without our having been consulted, life has no
meaning, has no reason or explanation, and especially has
no definite objective toward the attainment of which our
efforts should be directed.
Unsolved by Science:
To the great mass of mankind the reason for life here
on Earth is still as great a mystery today as ever it was in
the Dark Ages, in spite of the great advances in science
and invention and our so-called modern, streamlined civili-
zation. One reason why science has not solved this great
problem is that science does not deal with original causes;
only with their effects. It does not deal with ultimate
origins; only with their manifested phenomena.
All From the Unseen:
Since all the manifested universe comes from the unseen
and the intangible into the seen and the tangible, the source
of causation must lie far ibove the plane of its materiali-

zation, the plane of physics, or matter and its measurable
effects. Physical science therefore deliberately shuts it-
self off from the study of ultimate origins, saying that
they belong not in the realm of physics, but of meta-
physics and philosophy. Science, therefore, does not pre-
tend to study life itself; only the phenomena which life
exhibits as it manifests on Earth through the various
forms which we call living things.
Problem Not Igiuble:
But the origin of life and consciousness was not an
insoluble problem to the ancient sages and philosophers,
nor even to the modern mystics, because they looked be-
hind the phenomena to the nimeu; back of the material
manifestation to the immaterial thing-in-itself or the in-
visible cause of the manifestation. And having once
grasped the Law of Causation and Manifestation they
saw it illustrated and exemplified on every hand, as we all
can do.
Nothing Happens: (First fundamental concept)
Since this great cosmic problem and philosophical
mystery is so comprehensive in its sweep, in order to bring
it within the scope of our .essay we will call your attention
to, and ask you to keep clearly in mind, only three funda-
mental concepts. The first concept that we should realize
is that nothing happens. Everything manifests according
to the Law of Cause and Effect; according to law and
order.
Plan, Purpose and Design:
Everywhere in Nature around us we see plan, purpose,
design and the will to manifest, from the geometrical
form of the snowflake to the formation of a solar system
ora universe. For instance, there is no little oak tree in
the acorn, and yet the acorn invariably unfolds according
to, and materializes, the plan or invisible pattern of the

oak and no other kind of tree. Why? There is no little
bird within the egg, and yet from the egg of each species of
bird, that particular kind of bird, and no other, emerges.
Why?
Evolution From Within:
From a spiral nebula a solar system with its suns, moons
and planets appears. Why? From the single cell of a
fertilized ovum the body of man appears. Why? Out of
an inchoate Chaos an orderly Cosmos evolves, not hap-
hazardly but evidently according to plan, purpose and de-
sign. In other words, everything that we see in the
manifested universe around us has already existed in itself
in the super-physical worlds before it was materialized.
Physical Appearance Temporary:
Therefore, everything appears from out the unseen ac-
cording to the plan for its aspect of divine manifestation
which already existed in the invisible Worlds of Causa-
tion. Its physical expression is but a temporary and
partial manifestation or materialization of the thing-in-
itself for a brief cycle here in the realm of matter.
The Grand Plan:
And this takes place according to a conscious plan, pur-
pose and design, and will to manifest. Back of the whole
universe, therefore, there must be a Grand Plan in which
every manifestation occupies its appointed place.
Pre-existence: -
This doctrine of the pee-existence of all things before
their physical manifestations is illustrated in many biblical
pcges. Not only was "every plant of the field before it
was in the earth, and every herb before it grew," but,
"Verily, verily I say unto you, Before Abraham -was, I
am."1 "And now, 0 Father, glorify t,hou me with thine

own self with the glory which I had with thee before the
world was. . . . For thou Iovedst me before the founda-
tions of the world."2 And this same doctrine is the basis
of all great religions and is implicit in most philosophies.
Chicken or Egg?
It also answers the ancient Ã§oiundnini Which came
first, the chicken or the egg? Naturally the egg came
first. In answer to the question as to where the first egg
came from, we need only point out that all living things
manifest on Earth through the agency of an egg of some
kind, a germ-cell or seed.
Primary Pattern:
The original egg or seed of each species of life is pre-
cipitated and materialized out of the invisible as an ex-
pression in embryo of the concept, ideal, thought-form or
archetype of each species of plant, aninial or other form of
life which is projected from the Divine Mind for expres-
sion in the worlds of form. The egg or seed thus mater!-
alized acts as a focal point on Earth through which the
constructive and cohesive currents of the One Life of
God materializes the invisible pattern of that which is to
be manifested on Earth.
Man not Insignificant:
Since man is an integral part of the universe and of
Nature, we must assume that he too has his particular
place in the Grand Plan of the Universe through which
God expresses Himself in all worlds. In fact, each of us
has and occupies a definite place and fulfills a definite
function in that Grand Plan. Far from man's being but
an infinitesimal speck of life on one of the smallest planets
of a minor solar system, he is a vitally important factor in
the whole great scheme of the manifested universe. For

own self with the glory which I had with thee before the
world was.... For thou lovedst me before the founda-
tions of the world."

And this same doctrine is the basis
of all great religions and is implicit in most philosophies.

The original egg or seed of each species of life is pre-
cipitated and materialized out of the invisible as an ex-
pression in embryo of the concept, ideal, thought-form or
archetype of each species of plant, animal or other form of
life which is projected from the Divine Mind for expres-
sion in the worlds of form. The egg or seed thus materi-
alized acts as a focal point on Earth through which the
constructive and cohesive currents of the One Life of
God materializes the invisible pattern of that which is to
be manifested on Earth.

Why Are We Here? 5
without each individual Soul's functioning in his own
place, the whole Grand Plan would be imperfect to that
extent, and to that extent God Himself would find im-
perfect expression in all the worlds of manifestation.
The Real Man:
The Real man, therefore, exists independent of and
prior to his physical embodiment, as a result of causes
and purposes far beyond and superior to his appearance on
Earth. Hence, if we are intelligently to co-operate with
the great Law of Manifestation and worthily occupy our
place and accomplish our part in the Grand Plan, we
must know something of our origin and destiny, or the
object of physical existence.
Man not a Mortal: (Second fundamental concept.)
Realization of the first great concept of the pre-
existence of all things naturally implies the second funda-
mental principle, namely, that man is not a mortal, that
is, subject to death. This may be a startling statement
to some at first thought, but a little reflection will show
that we are not even entirely human! We all recognize
that a part of us is animtl: and yet not a part of us, but
only the physical instrument through which man, the
Real Self, expresses himself on Earth. While part of
our expression, the physical instrument, is animal, a part
is also human; that is, the personal aspect of our indi-
vidualized minds. But just as the body is not the Real
Man, neither is the mind the pre-existing Real Man.
Mind an Instrument:
Mind is only the mental instrument through which the
consciousness of the Real Man finds expression through
the formation of concrete ideas and their resulting
thought-forms in the mental world, which thought-forms,
in turn, find expression through the mechanism of the

brain. Man is, therefore, not a mortal because he is
neither merely a human-animal nor its personal mind, nor
does he cease to exist when he withdraws from his physical
instrument at so-called death.

The Real Man is essentially a divine, Spiritual Being, an
emanation of .the universal Causeless Cause, an individ-
ualized Ray of that universal Cosmic Spirit which men
call God. 1an4snot a mortal possessing a Soul, but is an
immortal Soul striving for expression through a mortal

Immortality:
All manifested things on the Earth-plane have a be-.
ginning and an end, but not the Real Self. For we are
immortal beings here and now, utilizing both our bodies
and our minds as instruments through which our con-
sciousness can find expression on Earth. Imnwrtality is
not something to be attained, but something inhereut, an
embodied phase of which we are all striving to express.
The Real Self, therefore, is a Spiritual Being who exists
quite independent of and far superior to its limited mani-
festation through the human-zinimal personality.
The Earth not our Home: (Third fundamental concept.)
The third fundamental concept which we should hold
in mind is that this physico2 world is not our home. We
are only visiting here for a brief span of some three-score
years and ten, more or less. This is one of the funda-
mental concepts back of all religions, since they all teach
that we ultimately return to the higher invisible worlds
or the spiritual home whence we came. From this reali-
zation that the body is not our Real Self and that this
Earth-plane is not our home, some sects have apparently
jumped to the conclusion that the object of life is to get

Why Are We Here? 7
Mastery of the Body:
Because they find that the body is a mortal like any
other animal's and therefore gives us considerable trouble
until we have trained it to respond to our guidance, they
seek to subdue it by asceticism, mortification of the flesh,
extreme fasting, emasculation and abuse. But control of
organs, functions and desires through weakness and de-
pletion is not mastery; only emasculation. To be a perfect
instrument the body should have all its organs and func-
tions in their most nearly perfect normal development,
but mastered and controlled.
Asceticism:
Such sects also strive to get away from responsibilities
and retreat from life in the world by retiring into the
forest, the jungle, the mountains, the monastery or the
convent. But the above mentioned realization that the
body is not our Real Self and the world is not our real
home should teach us not to despise the body nor long to
get away from life; for realization is only the first step
toward manifestation, while expression is the essence of
the Law of Manifestation.
The Aim of Life:
As practical students of the Cosmic School of philosophy,
we look upon these problems from just the opposite view-
point. From our standpoint the highest aim in life is
not to get away from life; else why come down to Earth
and incarnate at all? We should not seek to get away
from life, but to live life; to live life fully and hannoni-.
ously and joyously right in the environment where we
find ourselves incarnated; in fact, where we have chosen
to incarnate. And we should live our life happily and
joyously because of our higher conception of the object
of life, and thereby advance to a higher expression of our
Real Self.

Living Life:
By "living life to its fullest" we do not mean thatwe
should indulge every appetite and desire of the flesh, for
that would be living merely like animals.) Neither should
we live merely to indulge the whims, vanities, selfishness
and petty ambitions of the personality. We should neither
kill out nor give free rein to the functions of the animal
nor to the desires of the personality, but should master
them all and utilize them all to the glory of God, each in
its proper place and for its highest purpose. We will
then live life, not as animals, not even as mere human be-
ings, but as Spiritual Beings temporarily seeking expres-
sion through the human-animal personality.
Why the Soul Incarnates:

Living Life: ,
By "living life to its fullest" we do not mean
thatgwe
should indulge every appetite and desire of the flesh/ for
that would be living merely nike animals.) Neither should
we live merely to indulge the whims, vanities, selfishness
and petty ambitions of the personality. We should neither
kill out nor give free rein to the functions of the animal
nor to the desires of the personality, but should master
them all and utilize them all to the glory of God, each in
its proper place and for its highest purpose. We will
then live life, not as animals, not even as mere human be-
ings, but as Spiritual Beings temporarily seeking expres-
sion through the human-animal personality.
Why the Soul Incarnates:
Some may wonder, if the Soul is an individualized
Spiritual Being, an immortal Ray of the Divine,-all-
perfect, all-wise and all-powerful in its own spiritual realm

dimensional realms into the great limitations necessarily
imposed upon it by this three dimensional world of dense,
inert physical matter?

THE OBJECT OF PHYSICAL EXISTENCE
The Law of Materialization:
It is an axiom of our Cosmic Philosophy that everything
comes from the unseen, from the abstract to the concrete.
"These abstractions become more concrete as they ap-
proach our plane of existence, until finally they phenom-
enalize in the form of the material Universe, by a process
of conversion, analogous to that by which steam can be
condensed into water, and water frozen into ice." Man
appears upon Earth according to this same universal Law
of Manifestation or Materialization. But just why he
should do so is the great problem we are trying to solve.
The Cycle of Necessity:
The answer is that once the Ray of the Spiritual Self
is individualized and sent forth from the heart of the
Father into the worlds of form on its great outgoing
Cycle of Necessity, it must manifest its divinity in all
those worlds, induding the physical. In other words, the
Soul comes down into the limitations of physical embodi-
ment that it may learn to express as much of its divine
life, its divine love and its divine consciousness and power
here on Earth as it does in heaven.
Incarnation Necessary:
In each incarnation it manifests as much of Itself as it
has learned to express through the experiences of its

Three Object.:
Besides gradually (a) expressing our inherent Divinity
here on earth through (b) learning the lessons which only
embodiment in the limitations of physical matter could
teach us, there is a third object for our embodiment here
in Earth. That is (c) the spiritiiziiation of matter
through the spiritual radio-activity of the spiritual forces
we allow to flow through the matter composing our bodies
and radiate outward to all we contact.
Spiritualizing Matter:
Since man is a Spiritual Being, the radiations of both his
consciousness and his spiritual body have a far higher rate
of vibration than the matter composing his physical body.
Hence, all the matter composing his bodies receives the
radionic impress of the spiritual rate he is expressing, and
so is raised toa higher rate and tends to be spiritualized to
that degree. Thus does man uplift or degrade everything
he contacts according to whether his vibrations are spiritual
and constructive or whether he has lowered them to de-
structive rates.

He said, speaking of the Christ-consciousness' within each

we should find some other expressions of this same factor
already worked out in Nature around us. For the Law is
one, although it finds various expressions on each plane.
And if we cannot find such an expression then there is
some mistake in the concept of our premise. Therefore,
let us see if we can find an example of this Law worked
out in Nature around us.
Whence the Oak?
Reverting to the acorn as an illustration, is the acorn
materialized out of the invisible and then unfolded into the
towering oak just to do its own will or please itself? We
can easily imagine that the acorn might be quite content
and well satisfied to remain an acorn. It finds itself sur-
rounded by a nice shiny, polished brown shell which is so
strong as to protect it from the harsh conditions of the
rock and soil and the other dangers of the outer world
around it. It is "varnished" outside to protect it from
moisture, and it is lined with a soft brown down which
keeps it warm and makes it comfortable all during the
winter. Then why should it desire to change its present
satisfactory form of existence? Its own will would,
therefore, naturally be to rem2in as it is and continue its
present comfortable condition of life.
Superior Laws:
But the acorn is subject to forces outside of, and
superior to, itself and incomprehensible to its limited
aspect of consciousness. When certain greater cycles of
life roll around; when the great outpouring of cosmic
life on Earth takes place in the Spring, the acorn finds
itself subjected to new and unexpected and overwhelmbig
forces quite different from anything it had ever experi-
enced during all its existence. Great and revolutionary
changes are taking place both without and within itself.

to water. And as the water is absorbed the kernel begins
to swell and perhaps causes the acorn great suffering
from the internal pressure thus produced. And the acorn
may say to itself: "The pressure of affairs is getting too
great for me. I cannot stand it. I must find some relief
or I shall burst."
The Acorn's Tragedy:
The incomprehensible forces which cause it to expand
and produce this pressure ultimately reach a crisis, and at
last its beautiful protective shell does burst, is split
asunder and ruined, and finally disappears, completely ab-
sorbed by the new manifestation of the acorn's life. This
must seem like a great and appalling catastrophe to the
acorn, and therefore not at all in accordance with its own
will and desire. Yet how could it realize that it did not
come down to Earth to do its own will, but the will of a
far greater power than its own personality, the will of
Him that sent it into manifestation?
The Sprout Appears:
Then the acorn finds that the dainty germinal sprout
which it had so carefully guarded and protected between
its two thick starchy cotyledons is being pushed out of its
snug warm nest into the cold, harsh conditions of the soil
surrounding it. The delicate sprout is being cruelly forced
up through the soil by an overwhelming power whether
it wants to or not. But, following not its own will but
the will of Him that sent it, the acorn continues to push
its sprout upward and its rootlets downward, and thus,
according to the slow law of growth, a little at a time, or
cell by cell, it gradually absorbs from the soil around it
just those particular chemical elements and forces which
are needed and which must be built into the meshes of its
invisible pattern to materialize that pattern as the physical
tree.

The New World:
Thus ultimately the sprout pushes up above the soil
into an entirely new world, a world of freedom from the
darkness and the hard and hampering conditions and op-
pression of the soil, a world of sunlight and warmth and
air of which it could have no possible conception during
its earlier stages of growth while encased in its shell or
while pushing through the darkness of earth. Then it
realizes that it was the unfolding power of the life-force
from within that was pushing it outward, and the attrac-
tive force of the Sun that was pulling it upward all the
time, even though it could not possibly conceive of the end
to be attained nor the reasons why, nor the methods and
mechanism used.
Gradual Materialization:
The above simple illustration shows that, according to
the Law of Manifestation, the gradual materialization of
the pre-existing inner pattern here in Earth conditions,
each form doing not its own will but the will of Him that
sent it, is a basic law of the manifested universe. And
man, being a part of Nature, must follow the same law.
Our Outer Shell:
We incarnate here on Earth with our Real or Spiritual
Self embedded in the soil of the human personality almost
as latent and unmanifested as the pattern of the oak is
embedded within the acorn. And often for years there
seems to be little or no interest in spiritual things and no
spiritual unfoldment. During this spiritually dormant
stage we are quite content to live within the shell or en-
vironment with which we find ourselves surrounded, the
shell of the outer lifebusiness, social, intellectual, mate-
riallargely limited and influenced by the environment
and by the ideas of those with whom we associate, and
with no more conception of the worlds of spiritual light

has of the world of sunlight and air.
Spiritual Springtime:
But when a certain cycle in our unfoldment dawns, our
spiritual springtime, we find ourselves subjected to in-
comprehensible forces, and a change begins to come over
us. Whether we understand it or not or even realize that
it is taking place, we begin to respond to the warmth of
the Sun of Righteousness and to absorb the waters of
Divine Love. Then our hearts begin to soften, our con-
sciousness begins to expand and great pressure is brought
to bear on the conditions of our environment.
Our Expanding Consciousness:
Things with which we were content before, now seem
inadequate, even hampering. We can no. longer get the
same pleasure out of the old pursuits and amusements.
Old orthodox ideas and conceptions no longer satisfy our
expanding consciousness. Old habits of body, of mind,
of speech, even the old circle of friends, are outgrown.
We may even leave the home-circle and go to some distant
place where conditions are so different that it is almost
like a new incarnation.
Mental Unrest:
At first the pressure of this inner growth may be so in-
tense as to cause much mental unrest and even suffering,
especially if, from force of habit and lack of understand-
ing, and because of the opinion of others, we try to ding
to the outgrown husks of our former life, habits and con-
ceptions. But ultimately the time comes when the old
conditions are at an end and seem to crash down around
us and we think our life is ruined. But it is only the
breakup of the husks of old conditions that the new
growth may manifest. Thus at last we do break through

breakup of the husks of old conditions that the new

The Object of Physical Existence 15
the limitations and bondage of old thoughts and conditions
and environment and begin to grow spiritually.
Trials and Troubles:
For a time our lives may seem less harmonious and less
satisfactory, and we may seem to have more trials and
troubles than before. Since the shell of our former life
and conceptions has burst asunder we find ourselves sur-
rounded by new and bewildering conditions. At this stage
the tender sprout of our unfolding spiritual consciousness
may find it difficult to push up through the material con-
ditions with which we seem to be hemmed in.
Xncreased Sensitiveness:
Our increased sensitiveness makes us suffer greatly
from conditions, remarks, opinions and other vibrations
which foriierly affected us but little, and we cannot see
how we can carry on while so surrounded and shut in, and
hampered by such physical and mental conditions. This
is the sprout stage during which we appear to be growing
blindly, apparently blundering along through life, unable
to see our way or the why and wherefore of events, and
terribly irritated by little things.
Growing Pains:
Here is where a little knowledge of the Law and the
process of spiritual growth will prove enormously helpful.
For if we understand the Law we will realize that we are
only suffering from the "growing pains" of a new life and
an expanding consciousness. The tiny sprout can grow
only as it absorbs out of the seemingly harsh environment
of the soil which surrounds it just those particular chemi-
cal elements which it needs. First, these elements are
transmuted from the seemingly inert soil into nourishing
colloids by the living fire of the life-force focused upon
them. Then they are built into living tissue which enables

and environment and begin to grow spiritually.

the tender sprout of our unfolding spiritual consciousness
may find it diilicult to push up through the material con-

Increased Senaitivenell:
Our increased sensitiveness makes us suffer greatly
from conditions, rerlfarks, opinions and other vibrations
which formerly affected us but little, and we cannot see
how we can carry on while so surrounded and shut in, and
hampered by such physical and mental conditions. This
is the sprout stage during which we appear to be growing

16 Why Are We Here!
the sprout to grow. Just so must we learn to absorb the
essences out of the experiences afforded by the soil of our
environment and contacts, and build their lessons into the
fiber of our character for our spiritual growth.
Recognizing Conditions:
We accomplish this not by denying outer conditions and
experiences and refusing to have anything to do with
them, or by refusing to recognize the changes they bring,
but by recognizing them for what they are and discrimi-
nating as to their meaning, significance and usefulness.
Live Life:
As we thus learn to live life and to face each condition
and experience courageously, and with the positive force
of the indwelling Christ-light flowing through us from
within, that spiritual fire will fuse and transmute all the
crude ore of outer conditions into the gold of spiritual
growth. Then some day our consciousness will emerge
from the darkness of ignorance and lack of realization, up
above the hampering physical conditions and "conditioned
reflexes," into a new world of spiritual light, realization
and freedom. And this event will produce quite as great a
change in our comprehension of what life on Earth is all
about and why we come here, as the sprout experiences
when it pushes up through the soil into the sunlight.
Growth in the Dark:
Then we will realize that all growth must start in the
dark, and through pushing ever on and on through the
darkness, thus gain the strength to stand the light without
wilting when at last it emerges into the light. Then we
will realize that as we absorbed the Waters of Divine
Love from the Divine Mother, that have been poured out
upon us, and which surround us, we have the whole as-
similative and cohesive power of the Cosmos back of us
to enable us to conquer and learn the lessons and assimi-

late the forces of our experiences and build them into
growth that will enable us ultimately to reach up into the
light of the Sun of Righteousness.
Drawn Upward:
Then we will realize that it was the light and warmth
from the Sun of Righteousness that was drawing us up-
ward all the time. Then we begin consciously to co-
operate with the Law and put forth leaves and branches
and make the growth that shall sustain the bud, which
shall at last open into the flower of spiritual realization,
with its golden heart in direct contact with the radiance
of the Spiritual Sun.
Not Our Will:
In other words, we then realize that we came down from
heaven not to do our own will: certainly not merely to
give free rein to the gratification of the passions, ap-
petites and desires of our human-animal instrument, nor
even to be ruled by the petty vanities and ambitions of
the human personality. We came to Earth to unfold and
manifest the pattern and express the qualities, right here
in material conditions, of our inner Divine Self which
sent down its ray of spiritual life and consciousness for
embodiment and an expression in this world of physical
matter.
The Father's Will:
Jesus added another sentence of explanation to the one
quoted above when He said: "And this is the Father's
will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given
me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at
the last day." At first glance this seems an extreme state-
ment, impossible of fulfillment. For as we examine our-
selves and look at others in the world around us we seem
to realize and express sojittle of all the divine powers

statement seems so ridiculous as to be almost discourag-

The Unawakened:
It may also seem to disprove the statement of Jesus
when we see around us millions of people whose lives
give no indication that they are here to do the will of the

it would be impossible if we had only this one short visit

must again fall back on the ilÃustration of the Law as
demonstrated in the acorn. If we keep this in mind we
need not be discouraged; for of all the possibilities of
becoming a giant oak it loses nothing, although its pos-
sibilities are only in embryo and latent until it starts to
grow.
The Acorn Stage:
Just so is it with us. While we are in the acorn stage,
when we are told of our divine inherent capabilities and
possibilities they seem as impossible of manifestation as
those of the oak must seem to the acorn. When we con-
aider the traits of the animal body which must be recog-
nized and trained to be subservient to the higher guidance
of our reason and the well-known laws of life; when we
consider all the selfishness, vanities and personal ag-
grandizement of the personality which must be trained to
be subservient to the higher guidance of the Christ within
to say nothing about manifesting our higher spiritual
faculties and powersthe task does indeed seem hopeless.
But if we follow the same Law of Growth and assimila-
tion which the acorn follows we are bound to attain cor-
responding results in the end.

statement seems so ridiculous as to be almost discourag-

The Unawakened:
'
It may also seem to disprove the statement of Jesus
when we see around us millions of people whose lives
give no indication that they are here to do the will of the
Father or have any conception of it, and who leave this
world seemingly without having made any or but little
advance. It therefore seems impossible that
of, all that
he hath given them they should lose nothing. lAnd so

The Law of Cyclee:
For the acorn to grow and unfold into a mature oak it
must follow the Law of Cycles which requires many
summer-periods of growth and expression and many
winter-periods of assimilation and consolidation, periods
when the soft growth of the summer is consolidated into
firm rings of solid wood. And the storms of winter only
toughen its branches and sink its roots deeper into the
soil.
New Growth:
But at each springtime the tree starts out with all the
growth it has gained during the previous season with
which to begin its new season or incarnation. Of all that
has been given it of growth, unfoldment and attainment
it should lose nothing, but should raise it up each spring as
a basis of its further growth and unfoldment during the
new life-season.
Many Incarnations:
Just so is it with us. For just as the oak cannot attain
its full maturity in one season's growth, during one
summer-period or incarnation, but requires many such
seasons, so the Soul cannot unfold and express all that
the Father bath given it in one season or incarnation.
It takes us many summer-periods or incarnations of
growth and unfoldment gradually to give expression to
all the divine powers that are striving for manifestation
from within.
New Lessons:
In each incarnation we learn new lessons, or if we have
not learned the lessons of the past, we have to repeat past
experiences or something like them, until their lessons are
built into our consciousness and we are able to express
more of the Real Self within, put out new twigs and
branches, as it were, of our tree of life.

20 Why Are We Here!
Storms Strengthen:
The storms of life through which we pass may indeed
whip off some of our superfluous leaves, or certain super-
ficial expressions of personality, and perhaps alter our
mode of thought and life, but at the same time they
toughen our branches and sink the roots of our conscious-
ness deeper into the soil of truth and spiritual realization.
Then during the winter-periods or the time between in-
carnations, we review the events of our past incarnations
and learn the lessons from our experiences and consoli-
date them into definite Soul-growth.
Traits Built In:
Thus in the next incarnation we have all the traits that
we have gained in the past built into our character and
manifesting as innate tendencies with which to start out.
They are the twigs of our last season's growth on which
we put forth our new leaves of expression in this life.
Thus do we progress from incarnation to incarnation,
doing not our own will but the will of Him which hath
sent us, until ultimately we learn to express all that the
Father bath given us and lose nothing, but raise it up
again at the last day, or during our final incarnation, when
we have completed our cycle of manifestations in the
flesh and are prepared to progress in other worlds.
Resurrection:
It is certainly not this imperfect and fallible human
personality that is to be raised up at the last day. Still
less is it this present incompletely evolved and incom-
pletely perfected animal body, but the perfected nsanifesta-
tion of our Divine Self that is to be raised up at the last
day. This is the true doctrine of the resurrection of the
body. We repeat, it is not this particular body of flesh
which we are using in this imperfect incarnation; for if

which we are using in this imperfect incarnation; for if
The Object of Physical Existence 21
all the bodies of flesh we have occupied during our many
incarnations were to be resurrected, which one would we
choose? Such an idea is, of course, ridiculous.
The Spiritual Body:
And yet there is a body that is "raised up at the last
day." That is the Light Body which we finally build up
by the purification, transmutation and spiritualization of
certain atoms of our various bodies through "believing on
the Son," as our text says, or following and manifesting
the Christ within, until at our final incarnation we have
built up a spiritualized vehicle or body through which we
can manifest on any plane we wish.
Seeing the Son:
"And this is the will of Him that sent me, that everyone
which seeth the Son and believeth on Him, may have life
everlasting: and I will raise him up at the last day." The
power by which the acorn unfolds is the power of the
Sun, that focal point through which the light and lif e-
aspect of God is radiated to all forms of life in the physical
world. But the acorn must "see the Sun" or come under
its direct rays ere it can unfold into an oak. Yet it must
do more than merely bein the sunlight: it must "believe
on Him"or must correlate with and absorb the forces
of the Sunbefore it can be "raised up at the last day"
and complete its cycle of manifestation as the oak.
The Sun of Righteousness:
Thus must we follow the same Law. First we must
"see the Son" or recognize the Ray of the Cosmic Christ-
light within, as it manifests through our hearts. We must
realize that it is the light from that Sun (Son) that is the
source of our spiritual light and life, the power necessary
for our spiritual growth.

22 Why Are We Here!
The Cosmic Christ:
The Cosmic Christ is not only an infinite, celestial
Power outside of, and as infinitely superior to, us as the
Sun is to its ray embodied in the acorn, but is an individ-
ualized Ray of that Power manifesting within us, just as a
ray of the Sun manifests through the acorn. For the
Christ in us is a Ray of the Christ of God or the Cosmic
Christ. To gain some realization of what this really
means it would be well to repeat that sentence over and
over again as a mantram or affirmation. "The Christ in
meisaRayof theChristof God. TheChristinmeisa
Ray of the Christ of God. The ChristinmeisaRayof
the Christ of God," etc.
Believe on Him:
But it is not enough for us merely to "see" mentally or
recognize the Christ as the Son (Sun) of RighteoÃ¹sness.
We must "believe on Him"; that is, we must correlate
with Him through definite periods of meditation and
recognition, or "seeing" Him and correlating with His
force and building it into our lives as spiritual growth.
Only so can we attain "life everlasting." We have come
to realize that our life here is only a temporary nzanifesta-
tion for a few years in Earth conditions. Hence to at-
tain "life everlasting" we must not only "see" Him but
"believe on Him" to such an extent that we tune in to His
force and thus are enabled to give expression to that im-
mortal and Divine Self which we inherently are and
which nust ultimately find expression through the power of
the Christ within.
Obscuring Veils:
He is hidden from our gaze, from our inner perception
and realization, not because He hides Himself or wants us
to stumble blindly along life's pathway, but because there
are so many things in ourselves which hang like veils be-
tween us and Him, between our consciousness and His.

There are veils of misconception and misunderstanding;
veils of materialistic thoughts, desires and emotions.
Doubt is a thick dark cloud which hides reality from our
sight. Selfishness and impurity are also clouds which veil
Him from us.
Earth-born Clouds:
All such things send out their emanations like clouds
which obscure our inner vision and blind us to the glory
of Divinity. They are not we, but they are ours and we
are responsible for them, hence we must spiritualize and
redeem them. Our very desire for their purification and
spiritualization casts them into the flame of the Christ-
light, and the smoke that arises from their transmutation
often envelops us. But just as the rising Sun dissipates
the morning fogs, so will the Light of the Christthe
Sun of Righteousnessultimately consume and dispel all
the veils which hide Him from our sight. Then we shall
see Him in His robes of glory, wreathed in tender smiles
and radiant with Divine Love.
Those Who See Not:
Blessed are those who believe and love though they see
not. Blessed are those who are being consumed, yet live;
who are empty yet are filled,fifled with His love, His
compassion, His understanding. Never allow the clouds
of Earth conditions to dim your concept of His radiance
or darken your lives. Doubt not, but believe; for belief
opens the channel for the blessing. As we "believe on
Him" so shall it be unto us.
Object of Existence:
The object of physical existence, therefore, is so to cor-
relate with the Christ-force that we will quicldy and easily,
and without so much suffering from ignorance and mis-
takes, bring into visible manifestation the Divine Self
within which we inherently are.

To accomplish this we must resolutely turn all negative
experiences into positive, constructive forces, and con-
sciously practice expressing love, tolerance, harmony, hap-

working in harmony with the Divine Law, instead of
suffering from the results of acting and thinking contrary
to God's laws.
Begin Now:
Begin now to measure all your thoughts and actions by
some such standards as these: Are they (a) absolutely
true? Could they stand the test of public scrutiny? Are
they (b) absolutely dean? Are they expressions of true
love and affection, a pure desire for Soul-oneness on all
planes, or are they expressions of self indulgence or even
animal lust? Are they (c) absolutely unselfish? Are they
just and helpful to others as well as to yourself? Are
they (d) absolutely kind and loving? If they can pass
such tests as the above, are they expressed in such a kind
and loving way that they will make others happy instead of
hurting their feelings?
Instinctive Reactions:
And just as we react instinctively, before we stop to
think, to the physical and mental habits which we have
established, so should we formulate our ideals so definitely
and positively that they become habitual, and we will re-
act to them as instinctively as we formerly reacted to the
lower habits and ideals.
Lords of Creation:
Thus will we gradually become the Lords of Creation

NEW DIMENSIONS
The crashing events of this Second World War have
cracked through the crust of our former complacent ac-
ceptance of life and have made mankind aware of a wider
field of understanding: a new dimension in life and con-
sciousness.
Materialism Limits:
The truths taught and accepted by religion were held by
science to be unproved because not physically demonstrable
in scientific laboratories. But the crises of the present war
have now demonstrated, in the laboratory of human ex-
perience, the reality of the principles taught by religion.
For we now see that truth, honesty, ideals, love, com-
passion, brotherhood and co-operation are just as real as
bombs, submarines and airplanes. And they have far
greater power than the mightiest of war machines, for they
govern the use of all the materials of the world.
Science has assumed that the physical world has only
three dimensions which can be known and measured
length, breadth and thicknessuntil recently when a
fourth dimensiontime-spacehas been added. For it is
now admitted that time-space is not separate from other

But there is a fourth.
The Intellect:
These conclusions have been reached by one faculty of
consciousness alone, the masculine polarity of intellect.
Now the intellect is the instrument of thought-expression
which formulates and translates ideation into concrete ideas.
It is the sharp scalpel of the mind which dissects whatever
it contacts. Of itself it is cold, analytical, separative and
diversive. Its analysis of humanity has separated the one-
ness of mankind into races, nations, communities and in-
dividuals, each with majorities and minorities which estab-
lish pressure-groups for the attainment of their own selfish
ends.
This intellectual analysis has been so material and sep-
arative that we have been taught that races and nations were
almost separate species which could very well get along
without one another. Yet it was found that intercourse
was necessary and mutually advantageous. And as evolu-
tion advanced through savagery, barbarism and feudalism
into modern civilization, certain agreements had to be en-
tered into to regulate and stabilize such intercourse. And
from these "gentlemen's agreements" a code of interna-
tional conduct known as International Law was evolved.
But with the recent resurgence of brutal barbarism all this
has been ruthlessly trampled under the tread of mechanized
brute force. Through this wanton aggression, in which all
the rules of international conduct which centuries of re-
spect for law had built up, and the freedom of many non-

New Consciousness:
The tragic mingling of many nations in common misery
and suffering has broken down the artificial, intellectually-
28 Why Are We Here!
made barriers of race, language and boundary-lines, and
has awakened a new fourth dimension in the consciousness
of nations, namely, the essential unity of mankind. It has
brought the realization that manldnd is not made up of
separate species, but is one: one community of human be-
ings, all fashioned and projected into physical life by the
same Creator. Hence they are all the children of the one
God, no matter how diverse the names by which He is
called.
It is true that philosophers and religious teachers
throughout the ages have taught the essential oneness of
mankind, but this was actually realized only by the ad-
vanced few. And it took the brutality of this war to break
down the old intellectual concept of diversity into the reali-.
zation that beneath the seeming superficial diversity there
was an essential oneness of humanity.
This is but another evidence of our entry into the in-
fluence of the new Aquarian or Woman's Age. For it is
only the cohesive feminine force of love and compassion
that can reorganize the world. For love, not intellect, is
cohesive, synthesizing, constructive and unitive. The in-
tellect voraciously siezes everything it envisions and dis-
sects it. On the other hand, Love flows out to enfold, in-
tegrate, develop, expand and perfect all it contacts.
Several Fourth Dimensions:
Just as a new fourth dimension has been found for mat-
ter, so has there recently been recognized a fourth biologi-
cal urge or hunger. This is the hunger for oneness through
companionship; the craving for oneness through harmoni-
ous and happy relations with our fellow men. It is this
fourth dimension of hunger for unity that makes man a
gregarious instead of a solitary animal.
And just as the satisfaction of this fourth dimension of
biological hunger for companionship is recognized as neces-
sary for the well-rounded life of the individual units of

made barriers of race, language and boundary-lines, and
has awakened a new fourth dimension in the consciousness
of nations, namely, the essential unity of mankind. It has
brought the realization that mankind is not made up of
separate species, but is one: one
community of human be-
ings, all fashioned and projected into physical life by the
same Creator. Hence they are all the children of the one
God, no matter how diverse the names by which He is
called.
It is true that philosophers and religious teachers
throughout the ages have taught the essential oneness of
mankind, but this was actually realized only by the ad-
vanced few. And it took the brutality of this war to break
down the old intellectual concept of diversity into the reali-
zation that beneath the seeming superficial diversity there
was an essential oneness of humanity.
This is but another evidence of our entry into the in-
liuence of the new Aquarian or Woman's Age. For it is
only the cohesive feminine force of love and compassion
that can reorganize the world. For love, not intellect, is
cohesive, synthesizing, constructive and unitive. The in-
tellect voraciously siezes everything it envisions and dis-
sects it. On the other hand, Love flows out to enfold, in-
tegrate, develop, expand and perfect all it contacts.
Several Fourth Dimensions:
Just as a new fourth dimension has been found for mat-
ter, so has there recently been recognized a fourth biologi-
cal urge or hunger. This is the hunger for oneness through
companionship; the craving for oneness through harmoni-
ous and happy relations with our fellow men. It is this
fourth dimension of hunger for unity that makes man a
gregarious instead of a solitary animal.
And just as the satisfaction of this fourth dimension of
biological hunger for companionship is recognized as neces-
sary for the well-rounded life of the individual units of
humanity, so it is being recognized as an essential need
New Dimen,sions 29
among the larger units of humanity, the nations and races.
Thus it is futile and frustrative for any nation or race to
strive to be sufficient unto itself. For as civilization ad-
vances and its interests broaden, it realizes that it is but one
unit in a community of nations and races. And it takes
all these working together to form our common humanity.
Another fourth dimension is one in the realm of mind.
To the three dimensions of thought, feeling and will, there
must now be recognized a fourth dimension, the selfless
emotion of compassion. For the mind cannot be at peace
with itself and able thus to experience true happiness while
it contemplates the misery and suffering of the other in-
dividuals, nations and races which it contacts daily through
travel and world-wide broadcasts.
To satisfy this compelling force of compassion, in our
communities we organize hospitals, sanitoria, homes for the
deaf and dumb, for the blind, the crippled and the aged.
And to satisfy our compassion for other communities and
nations we organize the Red Cross, "Bundles for Britain,"
"Aid to China," and means of feeding the children of the
war-devastated countries.
Our Interdependence:
This new dimension of compassion makes us realize as
never before that since humanity is one, what injures one
community, nation or branch of the human family reper-
cusseseither directly or indirectlyto the injury of all.
Likewise, what benefits one redounds to the benefit and

interest dominates.
Just so those nations which are so intent on their own
affairs and on maintaining their own peace and neutrality
that they do not accept their responsibility for world con-
ditions, and so work for world peace and co-operation, will
be engulfed in the conditions of world inharmonies which
their isolation has permitted to develop, such as the on-
rushing tide of ruthless dictatorships. The nation which
will not co-operate with other nations for harmonious
world-conditions will be dominated by world tyrants.

and to prevent its subsequent resurgence after world peace

selfish, nationalistic and self-frustrating lines. And thus
they are bound to reap the same old tragic results.
Sacrifice Needed:
Psychology tells us that we must all make some sacrifices
of our personal desires in order to live harmoniously and
happily within our own consciousness for our own psycho-
logical salvation, that is, to avoid frustration and unhappi-
ness. We must also make sacrifices to live harmoniously
and happily with our neighbors for our own social and
economic salvation and happiness.
The athlete denies himself many indulgences because his
main purpose is to help his team to win the contest. Just
so must nations sacrifice many national ambitions because
their main desire is to live harmoniously and happily with
other nations for their own national and international sal-
vation, and for the welfare and happiness of humanity as
a whole.
Personal Application:
To apply this new dimensional realization to our per-
sonal lives we must realize that the cosmic concept which
enables us to enter this newly realized dimension of con-
sciousness is the realization that our brief life here on earth
is but one day's experience in the life of our Souls, our real

sciousnessfilter through into our finite minds only a little

naturally, the Infinite Consciousness can exhibit only tiny
aspects of Itself to the perception of our little finite minds.
But if the outlet into our human consciousness is blocked
because it is continually filled with personal, selfish and ma-
terial thoughts and desires, the cosmic concepts from our
fourth-dimensional consciousness cannot get through to ex-
pand our minds and hearts. And only by such expansion
can we receive a flash of Cosmic Consciousness to guide us
into harmonious co-operation with Cosmic Law and express
it in acts of brotherhood and oneness.
The Cause of Suffering:
It is only by our failure to live in harmony with Cosmic
Law that we bring upon ourselves the sorrow and suffering
which inevitably result from our opposition to that Law.
For the Law is like a mighty grindstone which should polish
and perfect us and sharpen our wits to understand it. But
if we resist its onward sweep it grinds us to dust. Our
suffering is not the punishment of a hard-hearted God.

in the cosmic manifestations of its mighty ongoing.
So it is not God who makes either wars or suffering, only
our failure to respond to the Cosmic Law of harmony,
brotherhood and co-operation. And we will continue to

entered. It therefore becomes the duty of you who can
grasp this ideal to spread it abroad so dynamically that it
will crystallize into action in your own life, in your family

and other nations. For only as the qualities of these new
dimensions begin their concrete manifestation in your per-
sonal life today through action, can they perfect your
personal unfoldment and allow you to manifest more fully
the Ray of God which you are within.
Feminine Forces:
Remember that it was the feminine forces of cohesion,
synthesis, integration and growth that brought the whole
universe into birth and manifestation. And through the
gradual unfolding of its pre-determined pattern (evolu-
tion) it is those same feminine forces which are gradually
bringing the Grand Plan to perfection.
Just so must the corresponding forces of understanding,

The Cosmic Concept:
Having heard remarks of discouragement from a de-
voted student which showed a lack of the cosmic concept
of present-day conditions, we feel it our duty to make clear
the laws back of the present crisis. To understand these
terrible conditions, keep in mind several distinct points,
namely, (1) that God established this world upon certain
fundamental laws for the good of mankind, individually
and collectively. (2) One of the most important of these
laws is the Law of Action and Reaction or "Whatsoever a
man soweth, that shall he also reap." Examined in the
light of this law, nearly every colonial empire has at some
time sown the seeds of selfishness, aggrandizement and ag-
gression and the domination of weaker peoples. By force
of arms they have invaded and seized other countries and
peoples. Therefore do not be surprised to see those em-
pires in their turn suffer invasion.
But (3) the great difference between their invasions and
the present invasions in Europe is that their domination of
the invaded countries was, on the whole, benevolent in-
stead of ruthless pillage and regimentation and enslave-
ment of the conquered peoples. Instead of inaugurating
human slavery they have abolished it. Instead of religious
persecution they did not interfere with the native religions,
except to abolish human sacrificesuch as the burning of
widows in India, head-hunting among cannibals, etc.and
allowed the natives to live their own lives while they were
being assisted to higher standards of living. Therefore,
while these great empires may suffer invasion and even
lose some of their colonies, those countries that are now
sowing the seeds of barbarism, cruelty and slavery must ex-
pectto reap similar results latefon. Also the United States
must some day expect to reap the results of its enslavement

makes up to both by such constructive treatment as will
overbalance the destructive.
Karmic Reapings:
The next thing to keep in mind is (4) that these national
karmic reapings are not a wilful punishment for our sins
by a revengeful God. They are a natural and inevitable
reaping of the causes each nation has set up. And until
mankind learns that the fundamental laws of toleration, in-
dependence, freedom to pursue their own evolution,
brotherhood and co-operation are the only basis for perma-
nent peace and prosperity among nations, all will continue
to suffer until they put these laws into effect through some
sort of World Federation or Super-Government such as
we outlined in our Philosophy of War and our essay on
The New World Order.
That some such World Federation is possible was clearly
seen by the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson, in his pre-vision
described in his famous poem, "Locksley Hall." Therein
he tells us: "When I dipt into the future far as human eye
could see; saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonders
that would be; saw the heavens filled with commerce,
argosies of magic sails . . . heard the heavens filled with
shoutings, and there rained a ghastly dew from the nations'
airy navies grappling in the central blue.... Till the
war-drum throbbed no longer, and the battle-flags were
furl'd in the Parliament of Man; the Federation of the
World."
The next point to be remembered is (5) that this conflict
is a manifestation of the battle between the spiritual forces
which make for freedom, order and civilization and the
anti-spiritual forces which make for regimentation, slavery
and barbarism; between the forces of the Christ and the
Anti-Christ. As we have explained in our Spiritual War
Bulletin at the outbreak of the war: "Behind all the outer

the Anti-Christ and those of the Christ; between the forces
of darkness and the forces of Light; f or only by the total

and the complete domination of atheism, can dictator-

Importance of Ilaith:
The next idea to hold is (6) the great importance of
keeping your faith in God, especially in the face of seeming
disaster. As we said in our article on Faith: "The lesson
for us today is that of true faith, that faith which is an at-
tribute of the Soul, which is necessary to correlate the
human consciousness with the Divine. . .. If we can
have that absolute faith which comes from the realization
of our oneness with the Divine, we can let the cosmic
Divine Light flow through us and our conditions and allow
it to solve our problems for us." The most tragic thing
that can happen to your spiritual life is a loss of faith in
God. Without faith only wretchedness and despair re-
main.
One student remarked that there could be no just God,
nor even a beneficent overruling Providence, or He would
not allow innocent and peaceful nations to be wantonly
and brutally invaded. But of course he did not consider
the Karma of those nations, as referred to above. God
does not set aside His wise laws to answer our prayers for
protection, even the prayers of a whole nation. Nor should
you cry: "There is no just God," because His children
break His laws of peace and brotherhood and have to reap
the result.
Remember (7) that it is the duty and responsibility of
each of you who are so privileged as to have the great
truths of God's fundainentaF laws explained to you, to
take a positive stand and to stabilize with words of cheer

and hope the faith of the unenlightened masses whose
ignorance of God's laws leaves their minds a prey to chaos
and fear. "Instead we must take courage and be supremely
confident, for Permanent Peace is the destiny of mankind
and cannot fail ultimately to materialize. Yet since man is
God's vice-regent on Earth he can do much to hasten the
day of the ultimate Permanent Peace, just as in ages past
he has done so much to retard its manifestation."8
Another comforting thought to hold is (8) that each
Soul chose to incarnate in the race and country, as well as
in the family, in which he now finds himself. There he
must be a positive factor by sharing in and helping to re-
deem, without complaining, the Karma of that nation which
he helped to create in the past.
So-called Death:
Also remember (9) that the mere passing out of this
earth-life through so-called death in war is not the most
tragic thing in life, only a return home. It is merely laying
aside prematurely your earthly garment and ascending into
the next higher phase of life, as we all must do sooner or
later. The really tragic thing in life and that which re-
tards your spiritual growth and piles up tragic Karma for
the future, is not death, but to perpetrate injustice, cruelty
and human suffering. Therefore mourn not for the mere
loss of life, the sudden ending of this incarnation. In-
stead, send out your love and compassion to all who are
suffering from the cruelties of war. Pray that they may
be given the power courageously to endure and that their
suffering may be quickly ended.
Light Ahead:
And finally, remember (10) that there is light ahead.
For there is nothing so dark that it cannot be lightened.
There is nothing so poor that it is hopeless. There is
nothing so bitter that it cannot be sweetened, nothing so

OLD CLOTHES
Effect of Clothes:
While in all but tropical countries clothes are worn
primarily for protection and comfort, they have a far
greater significance and influence. While it may not be
entirely true that "clothes make the man," they neverthe-
less have an important psychological and even spiritual
influence. They reveal not only taste, but individuality
and character. A man cannot feel quite the same in over-
alls and sweater as he does in a new business suit, a
Tuxedo or "tails." Nor can a woman feel the same in a
kitchen apron or "slacks" as she does in a tea or ball
gown.
Clothes Reveal:
CÃothes are more than an index of taste and preference.
They reveal much as to the stage of the Soul's unfold-
ment. Clothes that are worn to startle and attract atten-
tion to the personality are evidently expressions of vanity
and self-aggrandizement, and reveal a young and unde-
veloped Soul. Over-youthful styles for the middle-aged
call attention to the lack of youth and indicate a fear of
old age.
How to Dress:
While we should all dressas becomingly and charmingly
as is appropriate for the occasion, nevertheless middle--

finement over the thoughtless impulsiveness and frank
desire of youth for admiration. While all should dress
and look as youthful, healthy and vital as their age and
good taste permit, nevertheless maturity has a dignity,
graciousness and charm which is not natural to youth.
Clothes Appeal:
Clothes should appeal to beauty, idealism and modesty,
and contribute to true happiness. While "shorts" and
"sun-tan" suits have their place in sports and bathing,
they detract from our esteem and respect for the wearer
if worn elsewhere. Flashy, pert styles tend to make
flashy, pert girls, and are essentially vulgar.
Tasteful Dress:
Quiet, tasteful gowns may be beautiful also, and en-
hance the beauty of the wearer. They reflect the dignity
and poise that come from an inner peace and spiritual
unfoldment. They arouse thoughts of the ideal mother,
home and family, while flashy clothes arouse thoughts of
a night dub hostess and all the frivolity, vanity and human
weakness which she represents.
Psychological Effect:
According to the laws of emanation and radiation,
clothes take on the psychological, magnetic and mental con-
ditions of the wearer and the conditions under which they
are worn. Because of their psychological effect, one can
often dispel a discouraged feeling or a depressed mood by

Old Clothes 45
Cease Using:
Old dothes that have outlived their dignity or their
more commonplace usefulness should not be kept and put
away in the attic, the closet or the basement, but should
be passed on to some needy person or welfare society
where they can still give useful service to persons who are
not sensitive to their vibrations. Especially you should not
keep trunks or closets full of such old clothes and pour
over them; for every time they are taken out and medi-
tated upon they take your mind back to the time when they
were worn and thus tune you in to those old conditions,
ideas and emotions. Thus they tie you down to those old
associations and make you re-live them. Those conditions
are past and gone and you should have grown out of and
beyond them and above them. So, why burden yoursdf
with their unhappy and debilitating influences all over
again?
Changing Clothes:
There is much to be gained by a change of clothes after
a day's work. If you wear your office or working clothes
at home you bring back much of the strain, worry and
fatigue of the day's work. Hence it is difficult to take
your mind off the day's worry and let it rest. It is also
well to changeand even take a hot bathafter any es-
pecially disagreeable or inharmonious event or experience,
that you may free yourself entirely from those vibrations
and the more easily express the vibrations of peace, bar-.
mony and love of your own I Am Presence or Real Self,
which is waiting to radiate from within.
Discard old Thoughts:
Old thoughts, ideas, habits and emotions are the old
clothes of the mind. Once ijiey are outgrown, why hark
back to them? All that was good and constructive in
them has been built into your character as new equipment
with which you enter each new day or cycle of your life.

Therefore, deliberately discard and refuse to re-live and
react to all the sorrows, fears, mistakes and regrets that
have made your life hard, unhappy and unlovely in the
past, and refuse to burden yourself with them.
No Mental Attic:
Have no mental attic filled with such ill-assorted and out-
grown rubbish. Instead carefully select out of your lives,
out of your hearts, out of the storehouse of your thoughts
and feelings, beliefs and loves, only those that are con-
structive and conducive to your happiness and progress.
For whatever you select you burden yourself with in your
new cycle of on-going.
Prepare for New Experiences:
If you would be free to have new experiences, to have
new ideas, learn new truths and take new steps upon the
Path of Attainment, do just as you would if you were
going on a long and important journey. Go into your
inner closet, the closet of your mind and heart, and care-
fully view what you find, and choose only that which you
should treasure. Do not try to dig up old and forgotten
episodes from the dark corners of your memory. Look
only for the bright and shining garments of joy and hap-
piness, the bright jewels of faith, unselfishness and love.
Decide which it is wise to carry with you and which it is
wise to leave behind and forget entirely.
Select Your Vehicle:
If you were going on a long voyage your first care
would be to select the ship most suited to your needs.
Just so carefully should you select the spiritual ship or
movement or teaching that is to carry you onward toward
the mystical East where the Sun of Righteousness shall

dom of God and the Christ-consciousness or shortcuts to
Mastery and the Ascension serve only to disguise probable
disaster. For the high seas of life are too tremendous for
speed-boats.
Steady Growth:
Speed-boats are not needed on the spiritual voyage, for
there is no time in eternity, and all eternity is before us.
Also all solid attainment is a matter of steady growth, and,
to change the figure, we do not want our spiritual growth
to be of the hot-house type that fades when brought into
the outer world or is destroyed by the first blast of a storm.
Results of Speed:
All those who try to rush through life take many false
turnings which have to be retraced, often in sorrow and
suffering. Even in the great ocean liners which rush

What is needed is a modern ship, but one whose sea-
going qualities and safety have been tried and tested
through the years; one on which your friends have
travelled for years and can recommend; one on whose
structure (teachings) you can depend to carry you through
the tides and storms of life; one whose captain knows,
and can avoid the shallows, the tortuous channels and the
dangerous reefs which wreck so many haphazard voyagers.
Friendships:
Once having selected your ship you should realize that
your fellow passengers are to be close companions, with
whom you will set up ship-acquaintances which may ripen
into true and lasting friemiships. And it is comforting
to know that on this journey that is taking you to the

dom of God and the Christ-consciousness or shortcuts to
Mastery and the Ascension serve only to disguise probable
disaster. For the high seas of life are too tremendous for
speed-boats.
Steady Growth:
Speed-boats are not needed on the spiritual voyage, for
there is no time in eternity, and all eternity is before us.
Also all solid attainment is a matter of steady growth, and,
to change the figure, we do not want our spiritual growth
to be of the hot-house type that fades when brought into
the outer world or is destroyed by the first blast of a storm.
Results of Speed:
All those who try to rush through life take many false
turnings which have to be retraeed, often in sorrow and
suffering. Even in the great ocean liners which rush
through the seas at high speed, the vibrations of the
engines and the shock of the waves are so great as to be
most uncomfortable if not distressing and dangerous.

They are in the ship of these teachings, not for any hap-
hazard reason, but because, no matter what their outer
personalities may be, each is here because he is seeldng
the same destination, the same great end. And he is here
because he has paid the price. He has obtained his ticket
by the travail of his Soul and has paid for it with the blood
of his heart shed through his various life-experiences.
And his ticket has been accepted and stamped by the hand
of the Master of the ship. Therefore, all are worthy of
your understanding fellowship.
Correlation:
Now if you were taking a ship for the Far East with a
goodly company, and expected to spend weeks and prob..
ably months together in close intimacy and under all
kinds of trying conditions, what would be the first req-
uisites? Since you recognize that your own happiness on
the voyage, as well as that of your companions, would
depend largely upon your ability to correlate harmoniously
and in a friendly and appreciative way with your fellow
voyagers, the first thing you should make up your mind to
do is to carry with you and radiate friendliness, cheerful-
ness, unselfishness and love. Since worldly wisdom sug-
gests such a necessity for the success of your physical
voyage, how much more important it is for the success of
your spiritual voyage! And how is this to be accom-
plished?
Drop the Old:
Firstly, by leaving behind you the great bundle of old
clothes belonging to your former life: the old inharmonies,
fears, suspicions, resentments and selfishness that have
been such a burden to you and which have held you back
for so long. Or are you going to try to carry with you
still the flashy garment of "pride of personality" which
demands that you shall be recognized at your own estima-

Self-Righteousness:
If you are not troubled with envy or jealousy, beware
lest you wrap yourself around with that threadbare cloak
of self-righteousness which makes you think that because
you have not these particular failings, and that because
you are on board this ship and are one of its company,
you are therefore more advanced and hence more spiritual
than your fellow travellers. Do you not know that that
old garment is so threadbare that your companions can
easily see through it how superficial and triffing your so-
called advancement is? Do you think you can take these
sources of inharmony and unhappiness with you without
reaping the inevitable results?
Accepting You:
Perhaps you think such characteristics are the real you
and the world must accept you as you are or you will
have none of it. Do you think that the attention of the
company will be so focused upon you that their quiet
harmony will be disrupted and their peace upset, or that
you can turn aside those earnest Souls who are so valiantly
striving to progress and use all they have for the good
of all? Indeed not. Such forces may cause inharmony
and unhappiness, but it is you who will be broken, not the
others.
Pigues:
The piques, the slights, the hurts, the jealousies which
you imagine another is sending you, you yourself are
moulding into a weapon which will some day enter and
wound your own heart. Only sorrow and suffering can

when you throw it off and join your comrades hand in
hand as they march along, singing the songs they catch
from the angelic hosts, can you be one with them and par-
take of their happiness, and demonstrate the greatness of
your Soul unfoldment.

The Great Soul:
The great Soul is one who has such a realization of the
Divine Indweller, the Christ within, that he cannot be
offended or hurt by lack of outer recognition or by slights
to his personality. The great Soul is he who, like the
Master Jesus, may be mocked, despitefully used and even
scourged, yet is so filled with the glory of the Christ spirit
that he sees not the outer slights, feels them not, resents
them not. He is charged so positively with the Christ
power and is so busy radiating his cheer, comfort and help-
fulness to others that he forgets to be selfish or inhar-
monious, and even that there is a personality to be of-
fended.
Your Greatness:
You are all relatively great Souls in the pross of
greater or less manifestation through the garment of
flesh, even if you have not manifested that greatness to
any exceptional degree as yet. That greatness may still
be too covered up with the old clothes of your earlier
life, before you set out deliberately on this great voyage
to the Promised Land. Therefore, look deep into the
treasure chest of your life and heart and throw out the
moth-eaten clothes of purely earthly desires, thoughts and
habits, and take with you only those immortal, shining
garments of love and Icompassion, of sympathy and un-
selfishness which are the livery of the Christ; for you can-
not wear the old garments in the new life and be recog-
nized as a follower of the Christ. They are not being

you march side by side with your friends down the prom-

since they are all woven of strands of harmony they all
blend harmoniously; for they are all woven by the Spirit
within seeking harmonious expression through the per-

IDEALS
Ideals Rule:
Ideals rule the world for good or ill according to their
origin and character. Their origin may be divine or
human: either God-made or man-made. If high and pure
and constructive, they express in peace, harmony, beauty
and happiness. If low and impure and destructive, they
express in inharmony, lack of symmetry, unhappiness and
suffering.
Inner Pattern:
On every hand we see the inner moulding, directing and
manifesting through the outer. In Nature the pattern of
each genus, family and species of plant and animal, pro-
jected from the Divine Mind and manifested by the
Hierarchies of Builders to express a certain ideal, de-
termines the outer form and function. In fact, the planet
itself, the solar system and all the galaxies of universes
revealed by both the microscope and the telescope, are
but more or less imperfect materializations of ideals in
the mind of God.
Plan and Purpose:
From the vast and cosmic down to the finite and in-

stars in universes. Everywhere we see forms evolving
into more nearly perfect expressions of their ideals by
discarding the less efficient and less useful forms to make
way for ever more nearly perfect expressions of the
ideals which bring them into manifestation, subject to the
limitations of the density of the substances of which they
are composed and the effect of the environment in which
they are precipitated.
God-Consciousness:
This inner pattern or ideal which is bacic of all forms of
manifestation is the vehicle of the outbreathing of the
divine One-Life. And the forms which it animates are
symbolic expressions of the God-Consciousness which
underlies, enfolds and sustains all things, because it is the
Soul or ideal of the universe. It is the eternal verities of
this God-Consciousness which find expression in the funda-
mental ideals of spiritual truth whose expression is
basically the same in all forms of religion and philosophy.
Thoughts Express:
In humanity our ideals mold our thoughts, and the
thoughts that are repeatedly entertained or which strongly
occupy our minds find expression in our words and acts,
according to the first law of spiritual psychology. Every
thought which we think positively will find expression
through us in terms of action, unless counteracted by an
opposite thought of greater power. Man, like other
forms in Nature, has back of and within him his inner
pattern or ideal, the divine Higher Self or the Ideal or
Real Man. It is this Divine Self that is ever seeking un-
foldment and expression through the limitations of the
human personality, as the oak seeks expression through
the acorn and the chicken through the egg.

But man has the God-given gift of free will. Hence,
he can respond to and follow the ideals of his Divine Self
56 Why Are We Here?
or he can follow the ideas of his own human and limited
creation. But unless his self-created ideas are in harmony
with the eternal verities of spiritual truth in the spiritual
or ideal world, they will clash with those higher ideals as
they find expression in what are called the "laws of
Nature."
Laws of Natnre:
These so-called "laws of Nature" are but harmonious
and constructive outpicturings of the fundamental Law
of Manifestation, namely, from above downward, from
within outward and from center to circumference. There-
fore, man never breaks a law of Nature, for the Law is
immutable. If man violates it and refuses to work in
harmony with it, he reaps a destructive result. Instead
of his breaking the Law, it is the unchangeable Law which
breaks him, or he breaks himself against the Law.
Transition:
Those who really think for themselves and are not
swept along on the tides of circumstance and popular
fancy; those who give thoughtful and serious attention to
the events which are transpiring around them, realize that
they are passing through a period of rapid change of
ideals in both their personal and national life; changes
which affect all classes and conditions of people, as well
as the Earth itself. For man cannot separate change and
evolution from the Earth, since his body is of the earth,
earthy, even though his Soul is divine.
Change Necessary:
Old ideas of government, old ideals as to political, eco-
nomic, industrial, social and religious forms and relations
are rapidly changing and new ideals and objectives are
being established in their place. Now, change is essential
to progress. That which is set in its form of expression

and only vegetates until it decays. Hence, it is soon out-
grown or passes away. Change, therefore, is necessary
to readjust the outer to the expansion of the inner pulsating
life of Nature, of man, of general conditions and of the
planet itself, all of which are ever seeking new and higher
forms of expression, as seen in the annual miracle of
spring.
Divine Ideals:
But until man learns to found his new ideals upon the
Divine Ideals of the Inner Man and the Inner Life,
humanity will have to pass through a transitional period
of chaotic conditions and consequent suffering while ad-
justing itself to the new man-made ideas until it finds out
that glittering panaceas, presented by untutored and
spiritually undeveloped minds, for the solving of surface
problemswhich are only the effects of inner and deep-
lying causesmust fail. For only ideaLc founded upon the
eternal verities can endure, bring about a constructive ad-
justment of conditions and harmonious and joyful results.
How important then that these eternal verities be re-
peatedly and insistently presented to mankind in these days
of confusion and man-made speculations, theories and

and only vegetates until it decays. Hence, it is soon out-
grown or passes away. Change, therefore, is necessary
to readjust the outer to the expansion of the inner pulsating
life of Nature, of man, of general conditions and of the
planet itself, all of which are ever seeking new and higher
forms of expression, as seen in the annual miracle of
spring.
Divine Ideals:
But until man learns to found his new ideals upon the
Divine Ideals of the Inner Man and the Inner Life,
humanity will have to pass through a transitional period
of chaotic conditions and consequent suffering while ad-
justing itself to the new man-made ideas until it Ends out
that glittering panaceas, presented by untutored and
spiritually undeveloped minds, for the solving of surface
problems-which are only the eEects of inner and deep-
lying causes-must fail. For only ideals founded upon the
eternal verities can endure, bring about a constructive ad-
justment of conditions and harmonious and joyful results.
How important then that these eternal verities be re-
peatedly and insistently presented to mankind in these days
of confusion and man-made speculations, theories and
makeshifts.

Guidance Needed:
We are all human beings indeed, but what kind of
human beings we are depends upon the character of the
ideals we hold and express. For this reason it is highly
important that each student seek that Guidance in select-
ing the ideals upon which he is to base his life, thought
and action, as found in the various avenues of teaching
presented to him as Truth.
Ideas vs. Ideals:
Ideas may seem to rule in the intellectual world for a
time, but unless they contain something more than mere
intellectual force, something of the ideal, they sooner or
later pass away. They may have been good ideas, but
were not ideals. They must be vitalized by a spiritual
force of a shorter "wave-length" and hence greater broad-
casting power than that of mind. The idea of making the
world "safe for democracy" and the subsequent setting up
of several self-governing peoples was a good idea, and it
swept Europe The idea was grasped and accepted, but
it was not made into an ideal by incorporating into it the
basic principles of brotherhood and co-operation. Hence
it was followed by an equally widespread wave of dictator-
ships. The idea of the freedom and political equality of
women was long held by many, but only when it was
vitalized by the spiritual ideals of Susan B. Anthony and
her fellow pioneer workers did it become sufficiently radio-
active to spread until it gained sufficient power to amend
the Constitution of the United States.

the Inner Man and make it active in expression in his life
Select Ideala:
We should have dearly thought out and firmly es-
tablished ideals for all phases of our life. We should
have ideals for the body, its perfection, health and hap-
piness. This includes right ideas about food and proper
food combinations, proper exercise, proper elimination of
organic wastes, toxins and acids, etc. Since bodily states
and conditions react upon the mind, and influence and
color its mental states and reactions, it is important to es-
tablish ideals of perfection for the body and its functions.
Always visualize the perfect ideal functioning of all its
organs and parts.
Ideal3 of Mind:
We must also establish ideals for the mind. Realizing
that nothing can affect us which we do not admit into our
consciousness, we can set as our mental ideal the perfect
mastery and control of our mind and all its thought-forces.
We must remember that all thoughts that come into our
consciousness are not created by us. Many of them are
created by other persons. These combine with like
thoughts of others to form great currents of thought

Power of Thought:
Hence, we must carefully discriminate which type of
thoughts we will admit into our consciousness and enter-
tain there. For the second great law of spiritual psychol-
ogy tells us that, "Every thought we accept and entertain
we feed by our thought-currents and attention, and thus
give it power over us." If it is not in harmony with the
ideals of love, tolerance, purity, brotherhood and co-opera-
tion which we have set up as the standards of our own
thought and action, then we must resolutely turn our
backs upon it, shut our minds to it, and deliberately fill
our minds with a realization of the Christ, the I Am
presence, and let the radiance of its Christ-light so fill our
consciousness that there is no room for lesser thoughts.
Then its radio-active power will protect us from all im-
pure, negative, critical and unworthy thoughts, and will
neutralize and disintegrate them without our having to
concentrate upon or fight them if perchance they have
entered our minds. In other words, we must still the
tumult of the rational mind and listen to the Still Smait
Voice of the higher, Super-conscious or Spiritual Mind,
and allow it to be the mighty, victorious, harmonizing and
perfecting Intelligence which governs our world of con-
sciousness and action.
Worahip:
Most important of all, we must establish ideals of
worship and devotion to God, the great and loving Source
of all our life, consciousness and supply. For without
worship, love and devotion, no amount of intellectual de-
velopment can take us into the spiritual world, but only
into the higher realms of the mental world. It is through
the heart qualities and not those of the head that we con-
tact the Divine. Once we understand this law and sin-
cerely desire to draw closer to the loving Christ and let
Him fill our lives with joy and blessings and guidance,

we must open our hearts to Him in prayer, worship and

Meditation:
For this purpose we must have definite periods of medi-
tation when we relax all tension of body and of mind,
put aside all thoughts of the outer world that may have
occupied our minds, and still all its activities while we
listen to the guidance of the Still Small Voice in our
hearts, which will reveal the ideals for which we should
strive. For if we ask sincerely and devotedly for that
guidance we will be given the inner conviction and as-
surance of that which is best for us.

If it is enlightenment and instruction that is needed, in
some and often remarkable way we will be brought into
touch with that avenue of teaching which is best adapted
to our stage of unfoldment. Those who find in the Truth
expounded by these Teachings the most spiritual and in-
spiring ideals, as well as the most comforting, satisfying
and practical solutions of life's problems, should give them
such serious study that they become a part of their mental
and spiritual life, a firm foundation of ideals upon which
they can stand secure and firm. Then they cannot be
turned aside by the popular, but often misleading, fads of
the day. Thus will this Teaching develop a united body
of advanced thinkers and devoted disciples all seeking to
demonstrate and spread the same high ideals to all they
contact. Thus they will become a bulwark or safety-
station for humanity in the midst of astral mirages and
temptations, in the revolutionary conditions of the outer
life through which humanity is passing, and among the
swirling and conflicting cui?Ã¨nts of mere human opinion
as to what is Truth, what is cosmic philosophy, what is

Christ Ideal:
Let us therefore determine first to define our ideals of
life, of conduct, of thought, word and deed and then to
make them so real, so definite and concrete by repeatedly
concentrating upon them that we will react to them in-
stinctively before we have time to thinlc. For there is no
standard short of the Christ-ideal that is worthy of our
attention and attainment.
Our Ideals:
Just what is our ideal of life? Is it the uncertain ac-
cumulation of this world's goods whose loss leaves us
barren and desolate, and which we have to leave behind us
when we leave this world, or is it the accumulation of
spiritual treasures which we do take with us? Is it the
attainment of fleeting power and position in this world of
temporary sojourn, or is it the attainment of powers
which determine our position for all time in our real home
or heavenly world? Does it include a perfect body, an il-
lumined mind and a lofty Soul only to satisfy the pride of
personality, or to attain the Christ-ideal which will be
expressed so radiantly as to inspire others to strive to at-
tam and manifest that ideal?

THE WOMAN'S AGE
Cyclic Law:
Cyclic Law rules manifestation; for all manifestation
takes place in cycles of outbreathing and inbreathing. Day
follows night. Summer follows winter. Nations have
their birth, reach their zenith, decline and pass away. Sub-
races and Races arise, flourish and are no more. Likewise
Age follows Age. "The thing that hath been, is that which
shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be
done; and there is no new thing under the sun."1 And
yet each new cycle is not a repetition of the previous cycle;
for manifestation is not in a circle, but in a spiral. Each
renewal of expression is on a slightly higher level, for each
season's growth builds on the branches grown last season.
Therefore, existence is not a hopeless round of repetition,
for each cycle is a new opportunity for greater expression.
An Age:
While the Sun finds its cycle of expression during the
year in the twelve signs of the zodiac, there is a still
greater cycle called the Magnum Annus or Solar Year.
This requires approximately 26,000 years to bring the
heavenly constellations back into their same relative posi-
tions.2 And this Solar Year is also divided into twelve
signs. Each of these twelve periods is approximately
2160 years in length, and each is called an Age. Each Age

Thus, we are just closing the cycle of the Piscean and are
entering into the Aquarian or Woman's Age. So every
2000 odd years our solar system enters into a new region
in space, into a definite new division of the greater zodiac.
This concentrates upon the earth certain new forces and
new combinations of old forces which naturally affect
everything upon it. For instance, astronomers tell us
that the gigantic storms in the photosphere of the far-
away Sunvisible as the so-called "Sun-spots"have a
marked effect upon the weather, also upon the magnetic
currents of the earth, so much so that they interfere with
radio reception. And just as cosmic forces affect earth
vegetation, so do the forces of the New Age affect all
humanity.
The Aquarian Age:
Astronomers are still at variance as to whether our
planet Earth has actually entered into the Sign Aquarius
in the celestial zodiac. But all students of mystical
science, and most astrologers, agree that we have at least
entered into the influence of its penumbra or aura. Many
consider that we entered the Aquarian Age with the entry
of Uranus into Aquarius on February 12th, 19l2. Since
that date humanity has been subjected to the outpouring of
these new streams of cosmic force, especially the love-
stream of the Divine Mother, and has been reacting to it
in various ways. Since humanity as a whole requires
considerable time to react to new cosmic forces, at first
only the more sensitive and advanced can respond. And
even they seldom understand the reason for the new ideas
and the great urge to bring them forth which surges
within them. But nevertheless they become the pioneers
and leaders in all the advanced lines of thought and action
of the day. But regardless of the exact datewhich mat-

the Clock of the Heavens has struck the hour and a New
Day has dawned for mankind, and especially for the rapid
unfoldment of women.
The Woman's Age:
Aquarius is called the Woman's Age because the forces
emanating from the constellations in Aquarius are
essentially feminine in their influence. A symbol of a man
pouring out water upon the ground also indicates this
influence. For as water is the essential, nourishing prin-
ciple without which no life can be brought forth, it is an
expression of the Divine Mother-love of the Godhead,
and therefore properly symbolizes woman, who is the
human embodiment of that force. In fact, even the name
of the feminine or love-aspect of the Godhead in nearly
all religions is connected with water, such as the latin
Mare, the sea or the Great Deep, and in the Christian re-
ligion as Mary.*
Man's Domination:
Aquarius is the 11th sign, the 11 symbolizing a new
beginning, an Age when the feminine force of the Divine
Mother is being poured out in abundance that the woman-
hood of the race may have greater opportunity for un-
foldment. In past ages it has been man's force and man's
ideas that have dominated not only business, but society
and even religion, wherein the masculine aspect or the
fatherhood of God has been emphasized rather than the
motherhood. During the reign of the masculine qualities
woman has been regarded as a possession of man, and
when not a chattel owned for his pleasure she was at
least a plaything for his delight and comfort, or perhaps
even an idol to be worshipped. But man was always in
possession and control. Now man's period of rule and
domination is about over. He has proved by his failure to

The Allegory:
In the allegory of the Garden of Eden man is repre-
sented as being alone at first, but containing both the
masculine and feminine attributes within the one androgy-
nous body. But as that early ethereal body came more
materialized and came under the law of the physical
planethe Ltw of Dualitythe androgynous form could
no longer contain the expanding feminine principle and
the sexes had to separate. This physiological event in
the evolution of the body is symbolized by Eve's being
taken from Adam's side as a rib. We know it was not a
literal rib, for man has as many ribs as woman. None
are missing. Why, then, should so curious a symbol as a
rib have been used? Because it perfectly illustrates what
took place.t
Feminine Qualities:
The down-pouring of the Aquarian force is quickening
the feminine qualities in both men and women, and women
are coming out of their seclusion in the home and taking
their stand side by side with man in the governing of the
affairs of the world. Woman can no longer be regarded
as a mere "rib" or part of man, an appendage or a "side
issue." For even a rib is not an appendage or after-
thought, but is an essential part of the structure of the
body, without which the vital organs could not be main-
tained in their normal positions or receive their needful
protection. Just so woman is an integral and vital part of
the body of humanity and the structure of society. She
can no longer be hidden in the body politic, but must step
out and come forth, as the rib was taken out of Adam.
She must manifest her true self and take her true place as

thought, but is an essential part of the structure of the
body, without which the vital organs could not be main-
tained in their normal positions or receive their needful
protection. Just so woman is an integral and vital part of
the body of humanity and the structure of society. She
can no longer be hidden in the body politic, but must step
out and come forth, as the rib was taken out of Adam.
She must manifest her true self and take her true place as

a vital and ruling factor, not only in the home, but in the
world's affairs, and in the life of humanity.
Crusades:
But how is she to overcome the customs of ages and
make her influence felt in a world so dominated by man?
At first it seemed hopeless, but by responding to the urge
of the down-pouring of the Mother-force, she has organ-
ized various great crusades for political freedom, temper-
ance, educational reform and other progressive and uplift-
ing movements. As you know, her efforts have already
won her political freedom in England and the United
States and elsewhere, and has even amended the Constitu-
tion of the United States in her favor. And in France the
changes made in the Civil Code have released the French
women from obedience to their husbands, given them the
right to have bank accounts in their own names, sue for
damages, inherit property, etc.
The Goal:
But the winning of political freedom is not her ultimate
goal. It is only one step toward a destined end. For the
goal of woman is not to be a politician or an office-holder,
although society needs her influence in both those fields.
Her mission is to embody and express the Divine Mother
qualities for the uplift of the whole human family.
Changing Conditions:
The emergency of the world war forced millions of
women out of the round of domestic life into the larger
life of service to their country and its soldiers. Changing
economic conditions since then have forced other millions
from the home into the office or factory. And woman has
proved her ability to succeed -in all these new tasks. In
countless cases the manifold responsibilities of the cottage

her new found time and freedom? For one thing we
would suggest that all who realize the good they can ac-
complish for their community and their country, as well
as for themselves and their families, by their united efforts
in constructive endeavors, should carefully select some
such activityclub, church, society, etc.in which they
can take a sincere and active interest for the culture or
uplift of mankind.
Woman'a Influence:
Women are already having a vast, constructive influence
in their dubs for cultural and artistic ends, in Peace
Societies, Parent-Teachers aubs, and their support of all
manner of metaphysical, mental science, mystical and
religious movements. So their ideals of culture, education,
health, child welfare and social service are gradually up-
lifting the peoples of all lands where they are actively co-
operating, in spite of the seeming laxity of the noisy and
therefore conspicuous minority of aimless pleasure seek-
ers. Our suggestion applies with especial force to those
who are not blessed with families and who therefore have
more time for outside activities and recreations. But
care should be taken not to engage in too many such
activities or one is apt to dissipate one's forces too widely
and so accomplish less good.
Exceues:
No doubt in her new-found freedom woman has gone
and may still go to extremes in some ways, but time and
experience will solve that problem. At first many felt
that they could best demonstrate their freedom from man's
domination by aping man's ways. In an unthinking spirit
of bravado many thought that it was "Smart" and "mod-

gambling and smoking. Such habits are far more delete-

both her body and her mind by low astral forces which
commonly swarm around barrooms and similar places.
The woman of the New Age must regard her freedom as
something more than freedom to ape men. On the con-
trary, it should make her more able to raise the standards
of life and action of both herself and her family. For the
more inharmony she raises, the fewer advanced Souls will
incarnate through her to be raised by her.
Woman'i Place:
Man's age-long refusal to give woman her true place
beside him in the world's affairs, as well as in the home,
has perverted her talents and forced her to use the power
of her feminine charms to entice and enslave man so as
to gratify her vanity, her ambition, her comfort and her
economic security. But now her victory must be one of
moral and spiritual leadership. The woman of the New
Age must use her new freedom not to lure man but to lead
him. She should no longer play upon his chivalry merely
to lead him to the altar of matrimony, but to the altar of
worship; not to social and economic heights, but to spirit-
ual heights. She should seek to stimulate not his passions,
but his possibilities, his aspirations and ideals. For man
can easily be inspired and led to support almost any al-
truistic crusade by ideals sincerely expressed and actually
lived, where he could not be cajoled, forced or driven.
And since recently published statistics (1938) show that
there are 1,645,000 more women than men in Great

new spiritual ideals of beauty, harmony, justice, love and

during this Woman's Age. Hers being the intuitive type
of mind which can grasp the essence of Truth without the
laborious process of logical reasoning, she is the one to
grasp and bring forth the new ideals for man to embody
and establish in the outer world.
The Bringer-forth:
The wave of feminism now sweeping the world is the
result of the Divine Mother-force now being poured out
upon humanity from the sign Aquarius. It is therefore
stimulating the feminine aspect of all mankind with a
great desire to bring forth new conceptions of life and
human society, new realizations of truth and new condi-
tions for the health, happiness and uplift of manicind.
And because of her mission as the Bringer-Forth, woman
must be the leader in all social activities. The fate of
nations, the Race and even the Planet depend upon
woman's recognizing the great opportunity which the
Woman's Age can give her to accomplish her true and
greatest mission in humanity.

laxity of their home training in ideals, because their cradle
was not properly rocked. Woman's great opportunity to
influence the growing mind must be inspired by high ideals
and organized to attain definite ends, such as truthfulness,
courtesy, respect for ideals and spiritual principles, wor-

private family or the wider family of her school, her
business associates, her church, her clubs or her social

Woman'i Reiponslbility:
Therefore upon woman rests the moral and spiritual
leadership of the Race, as upon man rests the responsibil-
ity putting her inspired ideals, as well as his own, into
executive action and manifestation. Neither is superior
to the other, any more than one hand is superior to the
other. Nor can one usurp the proper functions and duties
of the other. Both must work together like the right
hand and the left to accomplish the tasks common to the
welfare of both. Man and woman must go forward hand
in band in harmony, love and mutual self-respect if the
New Age is to be ushered in in peace and prosperity and
its ideals attained.
Woman must keep ever in mind her true role as the
inspirer of mankind. When she cannot attain her ideals
through feminine means she should plan to have them
manifested by man rather than trying to use masculine
means herself. Thus will woman take her place as the

A Beaming Smile:
A smile is like a sunbeam. It lightens up everything
it touches. It sheds a mellow radiance on social inter-
course that no blaze of intellect can equal. A happily
smiling person upon entering a room can dispel the gloom,
overcome the cold, formal reserve of the gathering, put
people at ease and often set them chatting gaily with one
Ã¥nother. Just try it.
Costs Nothing:
A smile costs nothing, but creates much. It is the
easiest thing to give, and it brings great returns. It en-
riches those who receive it without depleting those who
give it. None are so rich that they can get along without
it. None are so poor but are made richer by its radiance.
Just try it.
Twinkling Eyes:
A sincere smile is always appreciated. It keeps one
from being tense and rigid. It "breaks the ice." Few
have the courage or the indination to try to thaw an ice-
berg, but a warm smile will do it. Just try it.
Smile in a Jam:
Smiling in a traffic lam prevents you from fretting or

A smile of sympathy can cheer the bereaved and lighten
their sorrow. Just try it. A loving smile can win the
heart of a child when even candy is refused. Just try it.
A friendly smile can put over a business deal which no
amount of cold intellectual argument could close. Just
try it. A smile is more endearing than a brilliant intellect.
Just try it.
Companionship:
A smiling person, even if uneducated, is a more pleasing
companion than a highly educated person who is coldly
intellectual. Just note it.

The Memory Lasts:
A smile happens in a flash, but the memory of it some-
times lasts forever. It creates happiness in the home,
brings success in business, fosters fellowship in the lodge,
and is a valued courtesy that should be given without
stint. Just try it.
Cannot be Bought:
A smile cannot be bought, begged, borrowed or stolen.
It is no earthly good until it is given away. It is sunshine
to the sad and Nature's best antidote for trouble. Just
try it.
Types of Smiles:
There are several types of so-called smiles, but only
that smile which is inspired from the heart is the true
smile. An insincere smile is not a true smile, only a smirk.
An enigmatic smile, like that of Mona Lisa, although it
may be intriguing, is not helpful. It makes people tmcom-
fortable because it is not frank and honest, and may be
suspected of being critical, derisive or contemptuous. A
wry smile is but a grimace. A smile of mere animal
pleasure or satisfaction is only a grin. A sinister smile is
but an evil leer. With such a smile, as Shakespeare says:
"One may smile and smile and be a villain still."1 But
all such are but perversions of a true smile.
Importance of Smiling:
At first sight smiling may not seem to be much of a
spiritual expression, but in reality it releaies the power of
the I Am into outward manifestation. The importance of
smiling is therefore many-fold. First in its effect upon
ourselves. It makes us responsive to the expression of the
inner harmony and love of our Spiritual Self. That
expression through us is developed by the frequency and

the degree to which we react and express that inner love
and harmony.
Relaxes Tension:
Smiling relaxes all tension of both mind and body, and
releases various mental repressions and complexes which,
if long continued, are apt to find destructive expression.
It helps to neutralize and dissipate depressing thoughts
and emotions. If one who is crying can suddenly be made
to smile, how the emotional state is changed and how
quicidy the tears disappear! Just try it.
Ill-humour Evaporates:
How quicldy ill-humour also evaporates before a good-
humoured smile. Recently a taxicab ran into our car and
the frowning driver seemed ready to curse us, but when
we smiled good-naturedly, his frown relaxed and he waved
us a cheerful "O.K." We also practice smiling on ail
who serve us, postman, milkman, gasoline attendants,
store clerks, etc., and do not stop until we get a smile in
return, no matter how forbidding their mien at first.
Just try it. But to secure such constructive results the
smile must be sincere or it cannot convey the positive
radiations which will overcome and supplant the negative
vibrations.
"Smiles the cushions are that soften
Man's hard knocks that come full often.

a physiological necessity for health. Not only does the
brain and nervous system require it for relaxation, but
the heart-beat is accelerated, the blood is oxygenated and
kept red, and the quickened circulation flushes the cheeks

Smiling at Dinner:
These psychological and physiological effects are so
well known that they are taken advantage of by the hostess
who is planning a dinner party. She is very careful to
invite only those who are known to be harmonious and
happy with one another; and smiles, jokes, wit and
laughter are encouraged, while controversial subjects
which might lead to arguments and inharmony are
banned. For without harmony and laughter the dinner is
a bore, and even the most delicious viands are less en-
joyed and may lie undigested because of tension or mental
inharmony. Shakespeare says: "Loose now and then a
scattered smile, and that I'll live upon." $

Law of Radiation:
Every living thing in Nature is but the vehicle of a
center of force, life and consciousness in the invisible
world which is seeking manifestation in the physical world.
Therefore, every living thing is a battery which is charged
with its invisible, dynamic forces. And since all forces
radiate their vibrations, even if they do not emit actual
emanations of themselves, they are centers of dynamic
radiations.
Skotographi:
It is said that even a leaf of a growing plant is so
charged with its radiant life-force that it will take a skoto-
graph or shadow-picture of itself if placed upon a photo-
graphic plate. Following the same Law of Radiation, we
also are batteries of radiating forcesodors, physical
magnetism, mental, emotional, psychic and spiritual forces
which impinge upon and produce some form of reaction
from everything and every person they contact, whether
recognized and immediately expressed or not.
Ebb and Flow:
According to the Law of Ebb and Flow which rules all
manifested lifeeven our incarnationseverything that
is emanated or put forth from any center of radiation or
manifestation must ultimately return to its source, bring-
ing with it the net results of its manifestation. According
to this law our Real or Spiritual Self returns to Its divine
Source bearing with It the net results of Its incarnations
on Earth
Vibrations Return:
According to this same law every word we speak, whose
vibrations we put upon the air, will bring back to us its
fruition sooner or later. Jesus recognized this law when

express if we "only stopped to think." But since those
who have not practiced self-control and self-discipline do
not often "stop to think," but speak and act impulsively,
their reaction is the spontaneous and instinctive expression
of the characteristics of the untrained animal-self.
The Body not We:
We all know that the body is not we, the I Am. It is
not the Real or Spiritual Self, but is only an animal into
which we have temporarily projected our ray of conscious-
ness in order that we may find expression through it and
experience the conditions and learn the lessons of this
temporary visit to the physical world. Therefore, with-
out our proper training of this animal and its instinctive
reactions, we cannot expect it to react in any other way
than to its unreasoned instincts of self-preservation, self-
aggrandizement and self-indulgence. And these instincts
find expression largely through the negative and destruc-
tive emotions.
Animal Emotions:
When all goes well with the animal-self it is happy and
contented, but when conditions arise which the animal
fears will interfere with its welfare or habits or curb its
self-indulgence, then opposition and negative emotions are
at once aroused. These are sometimes useful and neces-
sary for self-preservation, and such instinctive reactions
are then justified by reason and common sense.
Fears:
But most of our words and acts which are aroused by
fears of one sort or another (physical, moral, social,
psychic) are not justified by reason or common sense.
Especially is this true of such destructive emotions as
anger, hatred, jealousy, envy, covetousness, etc. Once
these are recognized as being not our emotions but those

of the animal-self, the absolute necessity for self-discipline
will be seen.
Self-discipline:
And self-discipline means training the animal-self to be
governed, not by its animal instincts, but by the ideals and
wisdom of the Real or Spiritual Being who is temporarily
incarnated in the animal body and which It is striving to
control and train for Its greater expression. It must be
trained to react as automatically to our ideals as it for-
merly did to its animal instincts.
Practice Smiling:
The importance of this philosophical explanation is that
our emotions are the most powerful sources of the radia-
tions we send out, even more powerful than our thoughts
and words, both of which are frequently dominated and
changed by our emotions. How important it is, therefore,
to cultivate our constructive emotions. One of the easiest
ways to do this is to smile, to deliberately practice smiling.
Ordinarily when we smile it is the natural outward expres-
sion of a friendly feeling we have within our hearts toward
the one at whom we smile.
Friendliness:
Now, friendliness is but an early stage in the manifesta-
tion of love, or that divine harmony of the I Am within
in which we should envelop all of God's creatures. There-
fore, a true smile, which must come from the heart, will
awaken a corresponding vibration in the one toward whom
we radiate our smile. Just try it. And he will naturally
react to it and express that same vibration back to us, un-
less some outside thought or emotion is allowed to step in
to suppress it. As Milton tells us: "For smiles from
reason flow, to the brute denied, and are of love the

84 Why Are We Here!
The Spiritual Effect:
But the most important effect upon us of smiling is the
psychological and spiritual one. Since a real smile must
come from the heart, it sets a current of kindness and love
flowing toward the one at whom we smile. This creates
a definite current of spiritual magnetism which actually
envelopes its object and penetrates his aura to his heart
and stimulates a like reaction. And when we have charged
ourselves with our current of positive friendliness, we are
impervious to any negative reactions, such as a frown or
an ungracious or sullen look or unfriendly reply.
Refuse to React:
And usually, if we consciously refuse to react to such
negative responses but intentionally keep on smiling in the
face of seeming rebuff, our current of friendliness and
love will melt the opposition and secure a smile in return.
Just try it. It is said that a continued smile and a hearty
laugh, if not dissipated by fear, will even disarm and make
harmless many wild animals.
Smiling Within:
This determination to maintain the smiling feeling
within and to charge our whole personality with friendli-
ness, acts so positively that we actually radiate our love-
charged magnetism and thus develop both the love-
radiating qualities in ourselves and increase our reliance
upon them. And the more we habitually rely upon the
love of the Divine Self within, and the more determinedly
express that Self, the more nearly divine we become here
on Earth. Just try it.
Effect on Others:
The next important effect of deliberately smiling is its
result within the one smiled upon. The natural tendency
is for one vibration to call forth and match another, a
frown for a frown and a smile for a smile. Therefore,

our smile tends to arouse a friendly response, and, more

hearts instinctively respond to a baby's cooing smile, and
we say: "What a dear I Isn't it a darling? Don't you

smile.
Help to Others:
Thus our smile will help him neutralize and throw off
any vibration of gloom, irritation or unhappiness which
may surround him and to which he may be reacting. Our
smile, therefore, assists him to manifest the Divine in him,
the love-aspect of his nature. Thus do we unconsciously

But the mere knowledge of this Law of Radiation and

apt to be neglected, yet which is of the greatest practical
importance. For few of us are naturally gifted with
such a sunny disposition that we naturally smile our way
through life. Hence smiling needs to be cultivated like
musical or artistic ability or any other talent that is im-
portant to our culture, welfare, happiness and success.
The Prison House:
Many persons are so shut up in the prison house of self
that they are actually ill because they cannot escape from
their negative reactions. The muscles of their faces have
become inflexible and set in ridges of tension. Their
brows are wrinkled and furrowed with care or negative
and depressing emotions whose lines become deeper and
deeper as though cut in stone.
Muscular Habits:
Once fixed in this habit the muscles actually fight
against any change of expression. It, therefore, requires
will-power, determination and persistent practice to estab-
lish the new habit of smiling. When the corners of our
mouths turn down, are relaxed and flabby, our spirits turn
down with them. So we must deliberately practice turn-
ing them up so that we can smile at will, and even before
we need to will it. Just try it.
Why We "Don't feel like it":
The more we "don't feel like it" the more we need it,
and the more will-power and determination it requires.
That is just the trouble, we do not feel like it. Why?
Because we are not responding to the harmony and joy
of the Divine Self within. We must, therefore, concen-
trate on that inner harmony, joy and love until we express
and radiate it. Let us ,naIe a definite exercise of it while
arranging our hair or while shaving, etc. Just try it.

deeper as though cut in stone.
Muscular Habits:
Once fixed in this habit the muscles actually iight
against any change of expression. It, therefore, requires
will-power, determination and persistent practice to estab-
lish the new habit of smiling. VVhen the corners of our
mouths turn down, are relaxed and iiabby, our spirits turn
down with them. So we must deliberately practice turn-
ing them up so that we mn smile at will, and even before
we need to will it. Just try it.
Why We "Don't feel like it":
The more we "don't feel like it" the more we need it,
and the more will-power and determination it requires.
That is just the trouble, we do not feel like it. Why?
Because we are not responding to the harmony and joy
of the Divine Self within. We must, therefore, concen-
trate on that inner harmony, joy and love until we express
and radiate it. Let us make a definite exercise of it while
arranging our hair or while shaving, etc. Just try it.

Our Spiritual Toilet:
We give time and attention to completing our physical
toilet before we appear in public. And our spiritual toilet
is just as important and is not complete without a smile.
If we start the day with a positive smile and a laugh the
rest of the day will take care of itself. Just try it. So,
as soon as we awaken and say a prayer, such as the "Morn-
ing Prayer" or "Prayer for Light," and give thanks for
our preservation through the night, we should deliberately
smile with joy that we have been given another day in
which to improve and increase and manifest more of our
Real Self than we did the day before. We should realize
that each day is a new incarnation, a new chance to take
up our life expression again, a new opportunity to improve
and perfect and radiate that expression.
Smile at Breakfast:
We should begin our self-discipline by making it a
positive rule never to go down to the breakfast table until
we can do so with a smile which shall be so positive and
dynamic that it will radiate our friendliness and love to one
and all. Greet each one heartily and sincerely. When
you say, "How are you this morning?" express real
interest and concern that each may be well and happy.
And if we smile positively and dynamically at each one we
can start each one out for the day smiling also. Just
try it.
Prepared Positively for the Day:
Starting out with this positive radiation we are properly
primed to meet every condition, circumstance or test
resolutely and harmoniously and can make the most of
each incident; for smiling keeps us poised within and
therefore self-controlIed Just try it. Thus we are able

Just try it. Especially during the hot months, when so
many are tired, nervous and easily irritated, how refresh-
lug and harmonizing is a cheerful smile when needed
most! And in cold weather how warming is a cheery
smile! Just try it. Never miss a chance to use it.
As the poet says:
"Tis easy enough to be pleasant
When life goes along like a song;
But the man worth while is the one who will smile
When everything goes dead wrong.
For the test of the heart is trouble,
And it always comes with the years,
But the smile that is worth the praises of earth,
Is the smile that comes through tears."
Prevents Misunderstanding:
A real smile is not the silly giggle of an immature or
vacant mind, but a real heart-radiation of dynamic power.
Do not fail to use it at the critical moment. Just try it.
When nonpiussed or taken unawares, smile before you
speak. It will affect your own mental state as well as the
other person's, and will modify the reactions of both. It
often thus obviates misunderstandings and avoids serious
trouble. Just try it. No introduction to strangers is
necessary if a cordial smile comes from the heart. It
passes current among all peoples in all lands and in all
ages. Just try it.

part of the smile of God in creative expression, and we

If we all will practice smiling at everyone to whom we

Why the Effect:
When only results and manifestations are seen, they
may seem to appear spontaneously and without previous
preparation, but investigation will always show that the
causes which operate to produce results invariably follow
certain laws and methods of procedure. In other words,
there is always a sequence of events and a mechanism by
which the results are produced. Unless the details of the
procedure follow in their proper sequence, the desired
manifestation will not take place. This law applies to the
mental, psychic and spiritual manifestations, which so
puzzle us in the Bible, as well as to physical events.
Application:
Once we understand the method and the mechanism
we can work in harmony with th law and produce the
results more quicldy and easily. It is to explain the
methods used and the technique necessary to produce
spiritual results that we present our Cosmic Soul Science,
so that studentsmay have a scientific explanation of the
operation of the universal Law of Manifestation in the
various events, and thus have a scientific and demon-
strable basis for their religion and for their faith and be-

The mechanism by which this is usually accomplished is
through the slow Law of Growth. The archetype, ideal or
mental pattern of all that is to manifest is projected by the
Will of God into the super-physical or astral world.1 There
an astral pattern or model is formed, and from it there is
projected into earth conditionsby a process of condensa-
tion and materializationa germ, seed or egg embodying
the potencies of the thing to be manifested. This acts as
a focal point in matter through which the consciousness
and life-force of the invisible being and its pattern or
model can flow, and through which their constructive and
cohesive powers slowly attract just those essences, forces,
material conditions and physical particles which are needed
to be built into the meshes of the astral pattern to materi-
alize it.
Law of Growth:
This whole complicated and mysterious process we
lightly, and quite unthinkingly, dismiss under the term
growth or the Law of Growth. But growth is a relatively
slow process, a process by which physical particles are
gathered and built into the structure atom by atom, cell by
cell, tissue by tissue. Therefore, all things that are to be
normal and stable, that are to endure for their particular
cycle of manifestation, must follow the slow Law of
Growth.

realities, then we need not be impatient. For no per,na-
nent attainment is gained except through personal effort
according to the slow Law of Growth.
New Lessons:
The rapid advance we made at first is due to the fact
that we have been but reviewing old lessons learned in
past lives through the slow Law of Growth. Hence we
do not need to ponder and weigh and argue about them
now. We know that which attracts us is true, and we
understand it as soon as our attention is called to it. But
a time soon comes when we have reviewed the old lessons
learned in the past and must take up new lessons. These
require time, study, meditation and effort to grasp and
assimilate, according to the slow Law of Growth, if we
are to build them into our consciousness, our character
and our life.
Higher Laws:
When we read of how God manifested through marvel-
ous phenomena to guide the Children of Israel, we usually
think of such things as something separate and apart from
ordinary life and law. But a little study will show that,
while nearly all things in the material world materialize
through the Law of Growth, there is a higher law and a
phenomenal method used by higher Beings in the in
visible when They desire to manifest temporarily for some
reason that is so important and immediate that the slow
method of materialization through growth will not do.
Materialization:
This is a method of condensation, etherealization and
precipitation, utilizing much the same principle that the

The Cloud Upon the Mountain 93
and forces of discarnate beings can manifest.2 This
usually takes the form of a mist or cloud out of which the
manifestation takes place. This cloud is composed partly
of the condensation of higher forces and substances, but
to produce physical results some of the finer materials and
forces of manalso to some extent those of animals and
plantsmust be used, because the odic force of the higher
Beings is far too fine and pure to manifest on Earth with-
out being mixed with the coarser substances of terrestrial
beings.
Psychical Phenomena:
Our Bible and the scriptures of other nations are full
of accounts of such phenomenal manifestations of high
spiritual Beings to man. Thus, when Jehovah wished to
guide the Israelites out of Egypt He gathered up the
animal magnetism, astral emanations and odic force of
the multitude and their animals, together with whatever
ectoplasm could be exuded by the priesthood and the more
sensitive persons, and used it to help condense a visible
pillar of cloud to lead them by day. (Exodus, xiii, 21).
This condensed cloud formed a shell about Jehovah and
gave Him a physical vehicle through which He could man-
ifest to the physical senses of the multitude. "And the
angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, re-
moved and went behind them: and (therefore) the pillar
of cloud went from before their face, and stood behind."
(Exodus, xiv, 19).

sufficiently powerful it will be visible in the dark as a
glow, or if still more powerful, as a bright light. That is

Lord first appeared to Moses "in a flame of fire out of the
midst of a bush; and he looked, and, behold, the bush
burned with fire (or glowed with spiritual radiance) and
the bush was not consumed." (Exodus, iii, 2). Had this
incident occured in the daytime Moses would have seen
only a mist or small doud about the bush. The bush was
probably of the shittah or acacia family, as that wood has
the purest and most powerful odic emanations, hence it
would be easier for the communicating intelligence to
manifest through the od of such a bush. Because of this
exceptional quality of its odic force, only wood of the
acacia tree was used in the building of the tabernacle.
Odic Force:
As we have pointed out elsewhere,3 mountains are great
sources of radiant odic force. It is therefore easier for
the Masters from the higher realms to manifest on a
mountain top, for there the odic forces of the earth are
purest and freest from contamination by lower emanations
and can thus more easily combine with the forces of the
higher Beings to produce a cloud. At the time referred to
in the text, the Israelites had only recently been released
from slavery, hence they were an uneducated and nomadic
people who required physical demonstrations of the reality
and power of their divine guidance.
Laws are Unchanging:
Since the laws of the various forms of spirit communi-
cation are fixed and unchanging, they are the same in all
races and in all ages. And just as a materializing medium
requires a cabinet to condense the odic or astral forces to
produce physical phenomena in a sÃ©ance, so did Moses
require a special tent, and later a permanent tabernacle, in
which the odic forces from himself, the priesthood and
the multitude could be condensed and purified and pre-

pared to mingle with corresponding forces poured down
from above. "Odic force is the motive power throughout
all God's creation as well as in the spirits' workshop on
earth."'
Discarnate Mortals:
Discarnate mortals dwelling in the lower earth-bound
realms of the astral world, when properly trained "over
there," can use the odic forces and ectoplasm of a materi-
alizing medium to produce physical manifestations directly
and with very little change, as such entities are dwelling
very dose to the eartl plane. But advanced Souls who
have passed through the state of purgatory and have been
purged of the low earth magnetism, cannot use such low-
vibrating and contaminated, but only purified, ectoplasm.
As Jobannes Greber rightly says: "The odic power
of a medium, although it may be sufficient in quantity,
is not always fit for immediate use. It must first,
in all cases in which it is to be employed by the 'su-
perior world' as a motive force, be purified, or, so to
speak, 'filtered.' To be sure, the inferior spirit-world
need not undertake any purification of the od of the
mediums, for the more impure this is, the better it is
adapted to the od of such spirits. Hence it is also much
easier for them to use such mediums for their purposes,
and they arrive at this end much more quickly than do
the superior spirits."
The Independent Voice:
Later on, after these first public and physical demon-
strations of His presence and power, when Jehovah
wished to speak to Moses, the odic force and ectoplasm
were concentrated by the spirit alchemists (the Cherubs)
into a doud above the 4rk of the Covenant from which
the spirit voice would then speak. "Then he heard the

voice of one speaking unto him from off the mercy seat
that was upon the Ark of Testimony, from between the
cherubims." (Numbers, vii, 89). "And the Lord spake
unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his
friend." (Exodus, xxxiii, 11).
Electrocution:
If the purified and powerful odic currents produced in
the cabinet of the tent or tabernacle by the spirit akhemists
were to come into contact with lower and impure currents,
all that could not vibrate to the higher rates would be
consumed. Hence the bearer of the impure currents
would be practically electrocuted just as surely as if he
had contacted a high-voltage power wire on earth. For
this reason even the high priest Aaron was not permitted
to enter the sanctuary until after the condensation had
taken place and the high tension currents had been shut
off. He was even required to call out that he had been
able to contact the forces properly and was unharmed.
"And his sound (voice) shall be heard when he goeth in
unto the holy place before the Lord, and when he cometh
out, that he die not." (Exodus, xxviii, 35). Such con-
tact was dangerous unless properly done, for when Aaron's
sons, Nadab and Abihu, "offered strange (that is, impure)
fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not, there
went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they
died before the Lord." (Leviticus, x, 1-2).
Reason for Darkness:
Since the human odic emanations and teleplasm or
ectoplasm are soluble in light, most manifestations of them
must take place in the dark. It therefore required tre-
mendous cosmic currents of extremely high tension com-
parable to lightning to condense an ectoplasmic cloud in
broad daylight out of which a materialized voice could
speak loud enough for the multitude to hear. To produce
physical phenomena in the light the cloud had to be very

able to contact the forces properly and was unharmed.
"And his sound (voice) shall be heard when he goeth in
unto the holy place before the Lord, and when he cometh
out, that he die not." (Exodus, xxviii, 35). Such con-
tact was dangerous unless properly done, for when Aaron's
sons, Nadab and Abihu, "offered strange (that is, impure)
fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not, there
went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they
died before the Lord." (Leviticus, x, 1-2).
Reason for Darkness:
Since the human odic emanations and teleplasm or
ectoplasm are soluble in light, most manifestations of them
must take place in the dark. It therefore required tre-
mendous cosmic currents of extremely high tension com-
parable to lightning to condense an ectoplasmic cloud in
broad daylight out of which a materialized voice could
speak loud enough for the multitude to hear. To produce
physical phenomena in the light the cloud had to be very
The Cloud Upon the Mountain 97
condensed or thick. "Lo, I come unto thee in a thick
cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee
and believe thee forever." (Exodus, xix, 9). Hence it
was only on especially important occasions when demon-
strations to all the multitude were to be made that they
were done in the daylight on the mountain top.
Dangers Involved:
While the condensation was taking place the whole
region was so dangerous that all but Moses and Aaron,
who were properly trained to deal with those high currents,
were forbidden to come near the place lest they die. "And
thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,
Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount,
or (even) touch the border of it: whoso toucheth the
mount shall be surely put to death: there shall not a hand
touch it." (Rxodus, xix, 12).
Force of Metals:
Among minerals, the odic force of those which rust,
disintegrate easily or tarnish badly have a destructive
effect on the odic forces of the higher ethers. This is one
of the reasons (there are others) why only gold, silver
and copper were used in the tabernacle and temple service.
Likewise the breastplate worn by the high priest before
"enquiring of the Lord" contained twelve jewels selected
because of the radio-active effect of their odic emanations.
Linen Garments:
For similar reasons the garments of the priests and
other attendants, also the curtains, veils, altar-cloths, etc.
were of linen or byssus, the size of the thread and the
fineness or coarseness of the quality varying according to
the purpose for which it was used. The rank of the
priests could thereforeasily be told by the quality of the
garments. "And thou shalt put upon them linen breeches

meeting) of the congregation, or when the
unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear
not iniquity (or impurity) and die." (Exodus, xxviii,
43).
Effect of Colors or Odors:
Because of their odic radiations, only certain colors
were used in the temple service, such as blue, purple,
scarlet, white and gold. The ephod or robe donned by
the high priest when entering the sanctuary was of blue
linen embroidered alternately with golden balls and purple
pomegranates. (Exodus, xxviii, 4). For similar reasons
all the details of the construction, furnishings and utensils
of the temple were carefully specified in detail. (Exodus,
xxxi). "And the Lord said unto Moses, take unto thee
sweet spices, stacte, and onycha and galbanum; these
sweet spices with pure frank-incense. . . . And thou
shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the
apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy. . . for the
Lord." (Exodus, xxx, 34-7).
Physical Demonstrations:
Through all these means the Progenitor of the Race,
Jehovah, and His deputies, the angelic messengers or
tribal gods, the spiritual guardians of the various tribes,
were able to give demonstrations of their presence and
power which were of such an overwhelming physical
character as to impress the undeveloped minds of the
ignorant multitude and ensure their obedience.
Power of the Voice:
So powerful were the super-physical cosmic currents
required, that the vibrations of the voice were "stepped
up" to an enormous degree so that the whole multitude
could hear them, just as by the proper use of a microphone
and a loud speaker the sound of heart-beat can be made to
fill the room, or the friction of the joints can be heard as a

loud, harsh squeek. Thus the voice was made to
reverberate like thunder, and even shook the trees and
made the people tremble. Therefore, it was literally true
and scientifically accurate to say: "God thundereth mar-
velously with His voice," (Job, xxxvii, 5). "The voice
of the Lord is powerful. . . . The voice of the Lord
breaketh the cedars. . . . The voice of the Lord shaketh
the wilderness." (Psalms, xxxix, 4-8).
The Voice of God:
On one occasion it required three days to generate the
necessary force. "And it came to pass on the third day
in the morning, that there were thunderings and lightnings,
and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a
trumpet (or megaphone) exceeding loud; so that all the
people that was in the camp trembled." (Exodus, xix,
16). Thus, from ancient times thunder has been con-
nected with the voice of God. Formerly this was con-
sidered very mysterious, and has even been called "mere
superstition," but now that we understand the mechanism
we see that under the conditions given the thunderous
voice was a physical reality, scientifically produced ac-
cording to the now well-known laws of electrical vibra-
tions.
The Druids:
Before the final sinking of the continent Atlantis be-
neath the Atlantic ocean, a large colony of priests of the
White Brotherhood and their followers migrated to what
are known as the British Isles, and became the ancestors
of the Druids. For ages these were the most learned and
cultured people of Europe, and were the progenitors or
source of the later culture of both Egypt and Greece.
From their center they sent out missionaries and established
branch colonies in seven principal countries. According
to Stinson Jarvis the seven branches of the Druid Church
were named after the seven stars of the Pleiades. "The

and had the most honorable position in the neck of the
constellation Taurus, the Bull, who represented the BULL
and Thunder-god of England."5 England is still called
"John Bull," the animal whose bellow rumbles like
thunder.
Role of Thunder:
One of the Druid legends says that God gave to a
woman a large cask called a TUN, and after the spigot
was opened it could not be closed, and from the leakage
came all the rivers of the world. "In England Father
Thames is still pictured as sitting astride a large cask or
TUN, from which water trickles. . . . The great boom-
ing Land-Shaker (Thunderer) was named upon the hol-
low booming sound of the empty TUN when it was
rolled."6 The poet Homer says that Nep-TUN, the God
of the waters, lived on the Thames, which was regarded as
the father of all rivers.
The "Thunderer":
It is no wonder then that London, on the river Thames,
still rules the physical sea through its navy, as the Druid
Church once ruled the seas of humanity through her
branch churches which gave out her thunderous decrees
as "the Voice of God." Since the Druid Priests were re-
garded as "the mouthpiece of God," they were called the
"Thunderers," and their decrees inspired almost as much
awe and obedience as did the thunderous voice of Jehovah
from the thick cloud upon the mountain top. And even
today the most influential paper in England, the London
Times, is called the "Thunderer" since it is supposed to
speak with such authority. Thus is England identified
with thunder and hence symbolized heaven.

The Cloud Upon the Mountain 101
Orders Xuued:
Because of its white chalk cliffs, England is still called
Aib-in or Alb-ion, meaning the White Island, from the
root alba meaning white. Thus again heavenly messages
of spiritual teachers, also political orders, were issued as
"the thunder of God."
Mount of the Law:
Since God spake to the Israelites from the cloud upon
the mountain, the white cloud, also white snow upon the
mountains, is used as a symbol, both of the dwelling place
and the cold, impersonal purity of the decrees of God.
The cloud-capped mountain therefore symbolizes both the
authority and the power of God's will as expressed through
law. Since the judges of the highest court of England are
supposed to ascertain the exact truth and to administer
the will of God as expressed through lawas the Druid
priests actually did through their psychic and spiritual
communion with Himthe judges in England to this day
still wear a full white wig to symbolize the white cloud
upon the Mount of the Law which they represent and by
which they should be inspired. Hence their decisions have
the authority of the voice of God whose representatives
they are supposed to be to administer His justice.
Symbology:
The cloud upon the mountain is therefore an universal
symbol of the direct, phenomenal and physical manifesta-
tion of God to man through psychic or odic power, the
thunder representing His voi and the lightning the flashes
of His eyes when "angry," that is, when the people resist
His guidance. Those who say that all use of psychic
forces is evil, and that od and other spiritual forces do
not manifest through psychic powers, simply do not know
their Bibles, and are simply stating their own untutored
and unsupported opinion.

The Real Self:
Applying this universal symbology to our personal lives,
the cloud upon the mountain symbolizes the cloud of glory
radiated by our own Real or Divine Self from the higher
realms, or from the top of the Mount of Attainment.
With the great mass of manldnd that great cloud of
spiritual radiance is much like the dot over the little letter
i, which represents the little human personality: that is,
it is just an overshadowing of the loving I Am Presence.
But as we send up our currents of aspiration to attain the
spiritual heights, we gradually reach up toward that Di-
vine Dot until finally we merge the little i into it and be-
come one with it, and so become the capital I of the I Am
Presence. Then we can say with Jesus: "I and my father
are 1." But we can accomplish this only as we open our
hearts to the light and love of the over-shadowing cloud
of glory, and through prayer and definite times of medita-
lion, ask the Voice of God within to guide us through the
wilderness of material existence to the Promised Land of
spiritual realization and attainment.

ALL CONQUERING LOVE
A Satisfactory Solution:
In the swiftly changing conditions of modern life there
is a pathetic eagerness among all classes for some basic
principle upon which they can rely and by the application
of which they can solve their problems and attain the peace
and happiness so necessary to their progress. But to
search for such a panacea in the outer world is utterly
fruitless, because the outer visible world is the world of
effects, not of origins; of results, not of causes. To seek
for it in the mental world is to encounter countless theories
created by the intellectual speculations of the human mind
throughout the ages, which upon trial do not meet the
requirements for constructive and concrete results. There-
fore, the only hope of a satisfactory solution is to seek in
the inner World of Causation for some cosmic principle of
expression which is fundamental to all manifestation.
Such a fundamental cosmic principle we find in Divine
Love.
The Mother-force:
While the mighty creative Father-force of Divine Will
is that which projects the ideal of the manifested universe
into expression, it is the.tremendous creative Mother-force
of Divine Love that cherishes that ideal, nourishes and
brings it forth. Hence, it is to Divine Love that you must
look, to bring forth your ideals of life. But first you

Consequently, you have all the powers of God the Father-
Mother to draw upon to help you in the manifestation of
your divinity.
Realization Needed:
You must therefore seek earnestly and ardently for a
realization of what Divine Love is. You must feel it as a
warm radiance which spreads out over the whole universe,
bringing to every person, every creature and every thing
upon the Earth the mighty joy of living, of growing, of
expressing its ideal,of accomplishing and attaining the
object for which each was put, forth into manifestation.
Once this realization has been gained, you can begin to use
it in your life. For you will then understand that the
inner radiance of this Divine Love is forever pouring forth
through you from its center of light, the loving I Ant
Presence or Christ-consciousness within, and is flooding
your whole being and all your activities and affairs with
its creative and regenerative and perfecting power.

Water is the symbol universally used to indicate the
Divine Mother-force of love. And as water is the most

Love, will not be purified and have its dross of earth dis-
solved and washed away; no emotion that will not be
purged of its selfishness and negative vibrations; no prob-
lem or obstacle to your welfare and spiritual advance that
will not be disintegrated, dissolved and so disappear from
your path of life if you consciously and continually bathe

God-in-Action:
Remember that this cosmic force of Divine Love is not
a mere intellectual concept or metaphysical speculation,
but is a mighty dynamic, cosmic, electronic force which
you can wield consciously to attain definite ends if you
will. It is literally God-in-action. But it will never force
itself upon you or compel you to use it. It will never
descend to manifest outwardly until it is first invited and
invoked to manifest within and through you. And there
is but one method of invoking it, and that is through your
eager aspiration, your sincere love for and your fervent
prayer for and devotion to it.
Your Radiation:
Once you have realized this Divine Love of the Christ
within as a blazing white light so intense that you actually
feel it thrilling and illuminating, warming and vitalizing
you and radiating from you, then it will begin to accom-
plish its miracles for you. Stop now and meditate upon it
that it may bring you the realization that Divine Love is
truly God-in-action in your heart, in your mind, in your
body, and in all your affairs.
At Your Command:
Knowing that it is responsive lo your direction, you
can command it to surge through your body, penetrating
and bathing every cell with its cleansing power, washing
out all impurities and revitalizing every tissue and organ
until every function is restored to normal and you manifest
perfect, radiant and joyous health.1 Then turn the cur-
rent of this Divine Love into your mind, dissolving all
negative or limiting ideas, all resistance to new and higher
concepts of life and love, leaving your mind calm and
receptive to inspiration-and guidance from above.

Then turn it into your emotions, washing away all ir-
ritation, all antagonism toward, or envy or jealousy of,
others, leaving your feelings poised and quiescent and at
sweet peace with all the world. If you have reason to be-
lieve that anyone is inharmonious or antagonistic toward
you, do not resist or fight back, but simply bathe that one
with wave after wave of the white Christ-love and see all
his or her opposition dissolved and washed away, leaving
only peace and harmony. If there is some material,
physical problem, condition or obstacle that seems to
block the path of your progress, focus your thought upon
it and bathe it and all connected with it in the warm cur-
rent of the Christ-love and you will see the opposition
rapidly crumble and disappear or you will be shown how
to solve the problem.
A criminal's Vision:
A number of beautiful examples of this use of the Love-
force are given in a recent book entitled Love Can Open
Prison Doors, by Starr Daily, which illustrates the work-
ing of this law so exactly and practically that it is worth
quoting extensively. The author was a hardened, habitual
criminal who had deliberately violated his parole and had
been returned to serve out a full twenty-year sentence.
After spending many days in solitary confinement in a
dark, damp "dungeon hole," hating God, himself and
everything else, he had a miraculous vision of the Master
Jesus. He was so surrounded and utterly filled with the
Master's Divine Love that it dissolved all his hatreds and
purged him from his impurities. Some hours afterward
he says: "Where I had been the recipient of the Master's
Love, I now felt myself exuding love. It seemed to pour
from me in the form of a mighty sense of blissful
gratitude, not for any one thing, but for all things, for life.
I had no discernment or consciousness apart from this
enchantment of love.

Purified Emotions:

Then turn it into your emotions, washing away all ir-
ritation, all antagonism toward, or envy or jealousy of,
others, leaving your feelings poised and quiescent and at
sweet peace with all the world. If you have reason to be-
lieve that anyone is inharmonious or antagonistic toward
you, do not resist or iight back, but simply bathe that one
with wave after wave of the white Christ-love and see all
his or her opposition dissolved and washed away, leaving
only peace and harmony. If there is some material,
physical problem, condition or obstacle that seems to
block the path of your progress, focus your thought upon
it and bathe it and all connected with it in the warm cur-
rent of the Christ-love and you will see the opposition
rapidly crumble and disappear or you will be shown how
to solve the problem.
Criminal'| Vision:
A number of beautiful examples of this use of the Love-
force are given in a recent book entitled Love Can Open
Prison Doors, by Starr Daily, which illustrates the work-
ing of this law so exactly and practically that it is worth
quoting extensively. The author was a hardened, habitual
criminal who had deliberately violated his parole and had
been returned to serve out a full twenty-year sentence.
After spending many days in solitary confinement in a
dark, damp "dungeon hole," hating God, himself and
everything else, he had a miraculous vision of the Master

dungeon now, no feeling of bitterness. The place seemed
to radiate with a wholly congenial and alluring atmos-
phere.... Unusual things began to happen. The
prison doctor stopped at my door for the frst time, to
enquire after my health, and to linger and talk.... The

days later I was assigned a new and easier job in the
prison shirt shop.

great miracles in your life if you will fake the time to
realize and use it as he did. Your consciousness is your
world, your universe. Nothing can enter it which you do
not permit to enter it by responding to it. Therefore, you
must choose that to which you wish to respondthe outer
or the inner.
The Source of Power:
Remember that there is but one ultimate Source of all
power, intelligence and love, and that is God. As we said
before, all manifestations of life, consciousness and power
are God-in-action. And He is in action in you. He mani-
fests through the Christ-center of your heart. To conquer,
you must first enter into the heart of your inner world
and be still before the majestic Presence of your real
Divine Self, the loving I Am Presence, and correlate with
and then direct your current of Divine Love to solve all
your problems.
Love ii Irresistible:
Realize that Divine Love is a limitless, all-powerful,
irresistible, divine energy which transcends all human
concepts, but which has a focal point in you, and its current
in you is subject to your control. By your conscious
recognition of and correlation with it you can release this
dynamic God-power to work its miracles in your life.
Since it is the source of all health, all happiness, all supply
and all perfection, when you recognize any lack of these
qualities you should refuse to react to that lack or give it
power over you. Immediately focus upon the negative
conditions the all-conquering current of Divine Love and
fill them with its power of perfect manifestation. See
that perfedion as already manifesting and refuse to think
of anything less than.perfection.
The Source of Happineu:
There can be no real happiness in the world without
some manifestation of love. Since you reap only what

realize and use it as he did. Your consciousness is your

The Source of Happiness:
There can be no real happiness in the world without
some manifestation of love. Since you reap only what
112 Why Are We Here?
you sow, if you do not receive expressions of love from
those around you in the world without, then you are not
radiating love to them from within. To "Love thy neigh-
bor as thyself" you must first respond to that Divine
Love that is within you, then it will flow forth to all the
"neighbors" that you contact. You do not have to love
the imperfections of their personalities. You merely bathe
them in Divine Love until the imperfections are lost to
sight in the radiance of Love; until the Divine Love
within them is released to transmute them and shine out
through the personality.
Love Your Eneinlee:
With this concept in mind you can understand the
scientific principle back of the injunction to, "Love your
enemies, bless (radiate to) them that curse you, do good to
them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully
use you, and persecute you." You now see this injunction
as a practical direction as to how to use Divine Love in a
definite way. For by following this rule all enmity,
antagonism, hatred and persecution are disintegrated and
consumed by the radio-active power of Divine Love. And
as the mighty current of Love is poured forth to such
persons, none of their lesser currents can swim toward
you or enter your aura against that mighty outgoing
stream, and hence they cannot reach you.
The New Cycle:
We seem to be passing through a racial cycle of dark-
ness, during times which may seem to become worse, when
there is much sorrow, poverty, disappointment, suffering
and despair. But as practical followers of the Christ we
know that the night is far spent and that a new day, a new
era, a new dispensation, a New Age is here. Therefore,
each enlightened Soul has a great opportunity, a great
duty, a great responsibility for spreading the realization
and the radiations of Divine Love. You must demonstrate

within that it flows forth from you as a powerful protect-
ing radiance which disintegrates all inharmonies and ob-
stacles, and gives you perfect protection and also the
power to face every outer and inner condition and pass
triumphantly through it.
Demonstrate Your Divinity:
When you have realized, definitely and intensely, that
you are not a mere mortal, but a Divine Being: when you
have realized your power to reach up and contact the
very throne of God, to become one with Him, to feel His
omnipotent power filling you, His Divine Love enfolding
you and His blessings showering down upon you, then you
will be able to demonstrate your Divinity and manifest
your perfection under all conditions.
His Helpers:
The enlightening and uplifting of humanity is a mighty,
mighty task for the Christ to accomplish. And it can be
accomplished only through those individuals who recognize
Him and become one with Him and so become focal points
on Earth through whom He can pour His force of Divine
Love and Wisdom. When you have recognized this
mighty Love that is waiting within you for expression and
have released it in your life, then you can dwell in that
God-consciousness and radiate the transmuting and all-
conquering power of Divine Love to perform its miracles
in your affairs.
Realization Needed:
Mere words cannot describe or express it. Only spirit-
ual experiences can bripg it to your realization. But once
it has thrilled your heart and has sent its waves of Divine
Fire coursing through the blood of your body: once it has
lifted your consciousness into the realms of heavenly
consciousness far above the things of Earth, then will

THE HEAVEN WORLD
Co-Workers:
Jesus said that our true brothers and sisters are those
who are of the same household of faith. Therefore, our
common interest in the fact of survival and the demonstra-
tion of communion with those who have passed on, make
us co-workers in the spread of that truth, no matter how
far apart we may live.
Personal Survival:
Personal Survival is a fact in Nature scientifically
proved. It does not depend upon man's belief or his
religion. Materialists and atheists will survive whether
they believe it or not and whether they are good, bad or
indifferent. Since the physical proofs of this fact have
been recorded in countless volumes, we do not need to
take up your time in presenting further proofs.
Basis of Religion:
The reality of the unseen world about us has been
recognized in all ages. And the fact that there are tin-
seen powers and conscious beings in the invisible with
whom we can communicate is testified to in our own
Christian scriptures and in all others. And this survival
and communication is the basis of all religions and all
forms of worship. Such forms of worship may vary from
the lowest fetish and voodoo worship, in which artificially
created astral elementals or "dliakas" have to be propitiated

Chapter XI
THE HEAVEN WORLD
Co-Worker! :
Jesus said that our true brothers and sisters are those
who are of the same household of faith. Therefore, our
common interest in the fact of survival and the demonstra-
tion of communion with those who have passed on, make
us co-workers in the spread of that truth, no matter how
far apart we may live.
Personal Survival:
Personal Survival is a fact in Nature, scientifically
proved. It does not depend upon man's belief or his
religion. Materialists and atheists will survive whether
they believe it or not and whether they are good, bad or
indiEerent. Since the physical proofs of this fact have
been recorded in countless volumes, we do not need to
take up your time in presenting further proofs.
Basis of Religion:
The reality of the unseen world about us has been
recognized in all ages. And the fact that there are un-
seen powers and conscious beings in the invisible with
whom we can communicate is testified to in our own
Christian scriptures and in all others. And this survival
and communication is the basis of all religions and all
forms of worship. Such forms of worship may vary from
the lowest fetish and voodoo worship, in which artificially
created astral elementals or "diakas" have to be propitiated
115
116 Why Are We Here?
and fed by the shedding of blood, up to the highest forms
of initiation, realization and union with the Divine. All
depend upon the reality of our contact with the invisible
worlds. But in the Christian world, after the fifth century,
such direct, conscious contact with the unseen ceased to
be systematically practiced and gradually came to be
frowned upon and finally banned.
Spiritual Hunger:
It remained for psychic research not only to demonstrate
that fact, but to organize it into a form of practice and
worship. But for one's own inner spiritual growth and
progress it is not enough merely to demonstrate the fact
of personal survival as a scientific law of Nature. Its
physical demonstration may satisfy the intellectual re-
quirements of a logical mind, and certainly should dispel
all uncertainty and fear, and allay grief over the loss of
our loved ones. But that is not enough. For man has
more than a mind to satisfy. He has a heart also. And
that heart hungers for the spiritual food of love and a
realization of God as a personal experience, just as the
mind hungers for the intellectual food of logical explana-
tions of laws and phenomena of the world we see around
us. Hence, something more than mere physical demon-
stration is necessary for complete Soul-satisfaction. A
higher contact is necessary.
Biblical Phenomena:
As we pointed out in a previous chapter, the Children
of Israel were given astounding physical demonstrations
of psychic phenomena, from "the pillar of cloud by day
and the pillar of fire by night" (Exodus, xiii, 21), the
direct, independent voice "from off the mercy seat"
(Exodus, xxxiii, 11) and "the voice of a trumpet exceed-
ing loud: so that all the people that was in the camp
trembled" (Exodus, xix, 16), a voice which spoke "face
to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend," a voice so

powerful that it "breaketh the cedars . . . (and) shaketh
the wilderness" (Psalms, xxxix, 4, 8). They were also
given examples of levitation and the bodily transportation
of living prophets through the air to distant places (ap-
portation) (I Kings, xviii, 12; Ezekiel, iii, 14 and viii, 3)
and the materialization of "the fingers of a man's hand,
and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of
the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of
the hand that wrote" (Daniel, v, 5), and many other re.
markable phenomena.
Phenomena Insufficient:
But all these marvelous phenomena did not keep them
from backsliding or from building a golden calf (Exodus,
xxxii, 4) and worshipping idols (Isaiah, ii, 8). Why?
Because the mere phenomena, even though far exceeding
in magnitude anything of modern times, did not touch their
hearts and develop love, unselfishness, devotion and true
heart-worship of God. They served in awe and fear
rather than in love. Hence, those stupendous phenomena
did not contribute to their true spiritual growth and did
not greatly change the thoughts and habits of their daily
lives. A higher realization was necessary.
Effect on Lives:
To be practical, let us apply this same test to ourselves
individually. To what extent have psychic phenomena
modified our lives after the wonder of the demonstrated
continuity of life has worn off? How have they changed
our habits? Have they made us more honest in the little
things of daily life? Have they made us more patient,
more tolerant of the faults and failings of others; more
kind and loving to all we meet? Or do our lives go on in
pretty much the same old way? If they do, then we need
a higher realization; something that will develop the Spirit
within us; something that will help us to live a more
spiritual or even saintly life.

Saints:
Now, a saint is not necessarily one who has fully at-
tained mastery, as the history of many medieval saints
clearly shows. A saint is one whose love of God and
whose desire for truth and righteousness cause him con-
sciously to strive for a greater realization and expression
of the love of God. He is one who lets God take charge
of and control his daily life and all his affairs. He may
still make mistakes at times, but he is ever ready to ac-
knowledge them, to repent and strive to correct them.
And by such striving to let the love of God shine forth
in all his thoughts, words and deeds, he grows closer to
God and to his fellow men, both 'in the seen and in the
unseen. This is the result of true spiritual, rather than
mere psychic, unfoldment.
Demonstration:
Physical demonstration is indeed as necessary and per-
fectly proper in its place today, as it was in the early
Christian church; in fact, it is the scientific basis upon
which our higher understanding of the seen as well as
the unseen worlds is built. But there is nothing spiritual
in mere scientific demonstration of personal survival.
Again we say that a higher spiritual contact is necessary.
Life Hereafter:
You are all familiar with the fact that both scientific
investigation and the countless reports from the unseen
show that for a number of years after passing over, life
in the lower astral world1 is but a continuation or exten-
sion of the life here on earth. Those who leave the earth-
plane have simply taken off their outer garments of flesh
like an overcoat, and gone one flight up. But by so doing
they do not raise their consciÃµusness sufficiently or develop
sufficient Divine Love to become bright and shining angels.

Neither do they suddenly become all-wise. They are just
the .came mortals that they were here until they have
progressed after arriving "over there." Hence, their judg-
ment and their opinions given through their messages are
not always wise or dependable.
Thought. Still Rule:
It is true that those who have lived sincere and good
lives here do not remain in the lower earth-bound realms,
but find themselves in a far more beautiful world than
this, but still a sublimated counterpart of earth conditions.
They are still interested in much the same things and have
much the same thoughts and desires. And they will re-
main so until they listen to and follow the higher teachers
over there, and turn their attention from earthly to heav-
enly things, and are purged from their earthly vibrations.
Only as they consciously seek higher ideals and aspire to
spiritual attainments through love of God can they progress
spiritually; for merely passing from earth into the un-
seen world does not confer spirituality. Otherwise dis-
carnate criminals, drunkards and the insane would liii-
mediately enter heavenly conditions, and we know they
do not.
Purgatory:
The Catholic Church rightly calls this first stage of the
afterlife "purgatory." For in some phase of it we all
must remain until we are purged from the vibrations,
thoughts and desires which hold us down to earth con-
ditions. In fact, often for years, thousands who have
strong earth desires do not realize that they have left the
earth-plane, as the reserches of Dr. Wicldand2 and others
have amply proved. Only as their rates of vibration are
raised can they rise to the higher realms of light and hap-
piness. And only after they have passed through the

can they enter the real spiritual or heaven world, far
above the astral.
Spirit Messages:
It is obvious that if our friends know about our con-
ditions and affairs here on Earth, they must stay in close
touch with us. It is only natural that for some time after
passing over they should be intensely interested in our
affairs, but after they have progressed to higher levels
they must come down to earth-conditions to look into
such matters for us. My mother and father say they cannot
tell me much about my physical affairs without getting
someone who is close to Earth to look into them and re-
port, as it is difficult for them to come down and take on
those earth-vibrations. Hence, if we ask our friends only
material questions we hold them down to material levels.
Therefore, when communicating with them we should ask
questions of a spiritual nature: about how they are pro-
gressing over there and how they see we can progress
down here. Then they are not held down to earth-
conditions. It often happens that through our studies and
aspirations we are farther advanced spiritually than our
departed friends. And since those who are interested in
us follow our thoughts and interests, we are a great help
to them in their progression. Many on the other side of
life attend our lectures, and we have often been told by
them how much they have thus been helped.
Psychic Faculties:
Although most Spiritualists call the astral world the
"spirit world" until they learn its limitations and its true
relation to the higher worlds above it, we have shown
that it i.r not the true spiritual world; nor are psychic
faculties spiritual faculties, any more than our intellectual

Although most Spiritualists call the astral world the
"spirit world" until they learn its limitations and its true
relation to the higher worlds above it, we have shown
that it is not the true spiritual world; nor are psychic
faculties spiritual faculties, any more than our intellectual
faculties are spiritual faculties. Neither do they take our
The Heaven World 121
consciousness into the spiritual world, but only into the
astral world. Neither are they latent faculties which all
will develop after death. Psychic faculties are merely the
use of our Jive senses in the astral world. Hence these
limited faculties cannot take our consciousness higher than
the astral world, any more than our mental faculties can
take us higher than the mental world, until those faculties
have reached up to the spiritual world and been illumined
by the down-pouring of the radiance of that world, far
above the astral and next above the mental.
Spiritual Growth:
The question now arises, what constitutes spiritual
growth? Our spiritual growth is determined by the de-
gree of our realization of, and our personal contact with,
God. And our contact with God is determined by the
character of our heart's aspiration, our love for the true,
the beautiful and the good. And we have already shown3
that the only reasonable object of our presence here on
Earth is in the growth of our consciousness of what is the
Supreme Good which men call God, and our correlation
with and expression of it.
Begin Here:
Research has shown that our departed friends are in
no closer contact with God over there than when they were
here, except to the degree that they have aspired to and
sought and attained such contact since passing over. For
the mere passing over does not bring us into the presence
of God or the Christ. Therefore, we must begin our con-
tact with Him here and now, whether we are psychically
developed or not. FoÃ§we do not have to wait until after
death to begin that contact. This we can do through the
higher realization of God or our Ray of His Spirit, the
loving I Am Presence, within us now.

What to Do:
But just how do we go about making our contact with
God? Not through psychic phenomena, as said before,
nor by the cultivation of psychic faculties, but through
higher aspiration; through personal seeking for a greater
realization and worship of God. As you questioned the
effect of psychic phenomena upon yourself, what effect
does the possession of psychic powers have on those who
possess them? Unless they seek the higher contact, do
they, as a rule, live more spiritual lives than other seekers
for truth? Does possession of psychic gifts, great as these
gifts are, make them known as outstanding examples of
those qualities that come from true spiritual growth? Are
they notably more loving and kind, more unselfish, more
healthy and happy than those who have no psychic gifts?
Certainly not, unless they seek spiritual unfoldment as well
as psychic, and live it in their personal lives.
Resulti:
Have their psychic powers enabled them to accomplish
results at all comparable to those attained by such spirit-
ually unfolded Souls as George Fox, John Wesley, General
Booth, Mrs. Eddy and the late Rev. Dick Sheppard, for
example? If not, why not? Because, we repeat, the
astral world is not the spiritual world nor the source of
spiritual power. Hence contact with it alone does not
bring spiritual power nor produce spiritual growth. It is
true that all those mentioned above had a certain amount
of psy.aic unfoldment, but what a difference in the use
they made of it and what they added to it! Spiritualist
churches often complain of their lack of growth and prog-
ress. The reason is easily seen. Many do not contact the
heaven world, the source of power and supply, but only
the astral world.
Consolation:
In these remarks we are not belittling mediums nor
psychic powers nor their invaluable service to sorrowing

ually unfolded Souls as George Fox, John Wesley, General
Booth, Mrs. Eddy and the late Rev. Dick Sheppard, for
example? If not, why not? Because, we repeat, the

bring spiritual power nor produce spiritual growth. It is
true that all those mentioned above had a certain amount
of psychic unfoldment, but what a difference in the use
they made of it and what they added to it! Spiritualist

Consolation :
In these remarks we are not belittling mediums nor
psychic powers nor their invaluable service to sorrowing

humanity. We fully appreciate, because we have ex-
perienced it and know, the wonderful consolation and the
joy that comes to people on both sides of the grave through
such faculties. For in many instances such communica-
tion is of the utmost help to the discarnate one as well as
to the enquirer. For instance, my mother tells me that
my love for her bathes her in a warm current of spiritual
force which helps her to advance every time I communi-
cate with her, and especially when I pray for her.
St. Paul'a Experience:
You will also remember that St. Paul communicated
with the discarnate Jesus constantly, for he tells us: "But
I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached
of me is not after man. For I neither received it of man,
neither was I taught it, but it caine to me through the reve-
lation of Jesus Christ." (Galatians, j, 11, 12). Even Jesus
communed with Moses and Elias (Matth., xvii, 3), and
often went apart to commune with the higher realms, or
heaven world.
Spiritual Power:
We do not belittle proper communications with the
astral world. We are only trying to make you think, to
differentiate, to discriminate between astral and spiritual
powers; as to where spiritual power comes from and how
it is attained. All the great spiritual teachers and leaders
throughout the ages no doubt possessed psychic powers,
but they added something more important to tl:ir use,
namely, spiritual realization and personal contact, not
merely with the astral world, but with God, the Source
of all power, wisdom and supply. Thus it was God's
power they manifestednd which accomplished the mar-
velous results through them, not psychic power from dis-
carnate mortals.
Man Not A Mortal:
To be practical, just what steps must we take to gain
that same realization? We must first of all realize that

of me is not after man. For I neither received it of man,
neither was I taught it, but it came to me through the reve-
lation of Jesus Christ." (Galatians, i, 11, 12). Even jesus

power they manifestedsand which accomplished the mar-
velous results through them, not psychic power from dis-
carnate mortals.
Man Not A Mortal:
To be practical, just what steps must we take to gain
that same realization? We must first of all realize that
124 Why Are We Here?
we are not mere mortals, mere human beings, but that we
are spiritual beings here and now. For there is an in-
dividualized Ray of God within each heart, the loving I
Am Presence or the Christ-within. All do not have
psychic gifts in this life, but all can develop contact with
God through seeking to correlate with Him and the Christ-
within through aspiration and prayer. And progress to-
ward that conscious contact and obedience to His guidance
constitutes true spiritual progress.
Meditation:
Therefore, just as some spend many hours each week
striving to develop their psychic faculties, so should we
seekers for the unfoldment of our spiritual faculties set
apart a definite time each day for meditation and prayer
for our spiritual unfoldment. Thus, while we fully ap-
predate the helpfulness, both to our departed friends and
to ourselves, of communion with them as we said before,
yet it is far more important for us to commune with
incarnate Spirits than with dicarnate spirits, namely, with
the Spirit incarnated within ourselves. If they are to
progress spiritually, our discarnate friends should also be
concerned primarily with their own spiritual conditions
rather than the earth conditions around us.
Spiritual Laws:
Now, just as there are psychic laws which we should
understand and comply with to contact the astral world,
so there are spiritual laws which must be understood and
complied with to contact the spiritual world. If we under-
stand these laws we will not have to depend upon the
fallible and often mistaken guidance of ur departed
friends, for that takes away our initiative and self-
reliance and makes us leaners on them. As we said before,
sincere and honest mediums can bring priceless comfort
to the bereaved by transmitting messages as nearly right

we are not mere mortals, mere human beings, but that we
are spiritual beings here and now. For there is an in-
dividualized Ray of God within each heart, the loving I
Am Presence or the Christ-within. All do not have
psychic gifts in this life, but all can develop contact with
God through seeking to correlate with Him and the Christ-
within through aspiration and prayer. And progress to-
ward that conscious contact and obedience to His guidance
constitutes true spiritual progress.
Meditation:
Therefore, just as some spend many hours each week
striving to develop their psychic faculties, so should we
seekers for the unfoldment of our spiritual faculties set
apart a definite time each day for meditation and prayer
for our spiritual unfoldment. Thus, while we fully ap-
preciate the helpfulness, both to our departed friends and
to ourselves, of communion with them as we said before,
yet it is far more important for us to commune with
incarnate Spirits than with discamate spirits, namely, with
the Spirit incarnated within ourselves. If they are to
progress spiritually, our discamate friends should also be
concerned primarily with their own spiritual conditions
rather than the earth conditions around us.
Spiritual Laws:
Now, just as there are psychic laws which we should
understand and comply with to contact the astral world,
so there are spiritual laws which must be understood and
complied with to contact the spiritual world. If we under-
stand these laws we will not have to depend upon the
fallible and often mistaken guidance of our departed
friends, for that takes away our initiative and self-
reliance and makes us leaners on them. As we said before,
sincere and honest mediums can bring priceless comfort
to the bereaved by transmitting messages as nearly right
as possible from their loved ones, but we do not have to
The Heaven World 125
depend upon them for spiritual instruction and personal
guidance. We must learn to seek for and depend upon
the guidance of the God within, the loving I Am Presence.
That guidance once consciously established is infallible.
This is the great aim of the higher realization: direct
guidance by the incarnate Ray of God which is our Real
or Spiritual Self.
Cosmic Soul Science:
It is these laws of spiritual guidance, as distinct from
"spirit guidance," as well as giving a satisfying and
scientific explanation of all conditions and problems of
manifested existence, that we present in these essays and
in the many volumes of teachings which we have received
through inspiration.
Spirit Guides:
We know that some spiritualists say that they do not
need to study the philosophy of life, as their "guides" tell
them all they need to know. But that is a very narrow
viewpoint, and intellectually stultifying. The mind needs
explanations of the laws and the causes back of all mani-
fested things if it is to have a clear understanding of that
which the Spirit is, and that which the spirits reveal.

reach His consciousness, make Him aware of their need

His Name:
Not only is His force presentaccording to His prom-
ise"Wherever two or three are gathered together in
My name," but anyone can tune-in to His consciousness
and receive His help at any time if he will use the proper
technique of the higher aspiration. For just as your love
and mental wireless call for your discamate friends
reaches them and brings its response, just so surdy does
your love and your spiritual wireless call reach Him and
bring His response.

These calls are not mere imagination or metaphysical
speculation, but are actual currents of force which can be
measured with appropriate instruments. In Washington
we have a radionic instrument, using radio tubes, which
measures vibrations up to fifty million cycles. With this
instriunent, in our experiments one day, we took the read-
ing of Mrs. Curtiss' vitality index and found it to be well
within the normal range at 37. We then repeated our

tacting and being filled with the powers invoked. When
we felt the answering vibration we took another reading
of Mrs. Curtiss' vitality and found that it had risen from
37 to 48 just through the power of that prayer. Then I
concentrated the force upon her more directly and her
vitality rose still further, up to 60, or nearly double the
normal reading! So you see that His force is so real that
it can be physically demonstrated and scientifically meas-

Responie:
Not only do our prayers for our loved ones reach and
help them, but all sincere prayers to God reach a Mind
that understands and a Heart that is compassionate, lov-
ing and always responsive. This can be demonstrated to
any sincere seeker or even to an entire audience if there
are enough present who would like to see a physical
demonstration of the power of God and feel it thrill their
physical bodies. It will take only a minute or two, if all
present co-operate and assist. Try it just as an experi-
ment, whether you believe in it or not.
Prayer Technique:
First of all, uncross your feet and unclose your hands,
for crossing the feet and hands short-circuits you to the
forces around you. The right hand is the broadcasting
and blessing hand and the hand with which you accomplish
in the outer world, but since in this case you do not wish to
broadcast the force received but wish to charge yourself
with it, place your right hand over the center of your
chest (heart), the center of your spiritual forces. The
left hand is the receiving hand or the wireless antenna
through which you absorb the spiritual forces which your
prayers invoke. Therefore, hold the left hand up com-
fortably, opposite the left shoulder, with the elbow bent
and with the fingers spread and the thumb pointing back
over the shoulder. While holding this posture repeat the
Prayer for Light. Remember that it is not only your
sincerity, but the intensity of your love and aspiration
that sends your current of spiritual force shooting up
through the lower realms like a skyrocket to contact the
plane to which you aspire. And over this line of light and
love you receive the returncurrent from that realm.

While still holding this posture, close your eyes just to

Physical Proof:
We ask all who felt the down-pouring currents of force
or the vibrations or the warm current of love thrill their
bodies, to make a written record of it. That is a physical
proof of the objective reality of the forces actually in-

opportunity to say something or do something kind for
someone.
Bless Others:
Try to see in everyone the Ray of God he has incarnated
to manifest, no matter how much it may be obscured by

Refuse Destructive Thoughts:
In these days of tribulation, when the Earth and its
humanity are passing through great changes and many
dire events, it is not a time to fill our minds with such
troubles by enumerating them. Nor is it a time to proph-
esy dire changes in the near future, even though they may
be destined to come. Much less is it a time to select any
one person, ruler, nation or condition and pin upon him or
it the full responsibility for the deplorable conditions in
which the world finds itself.
Blame No One:
It may be that there are those who make themselves
channels through which selfish and destructive forces
focajize and manifest, yet the evil in the world today is
not attributable to any one man, nation or condition, but
is the net result of the negative conditions generated by all
humanity, who like sheep have strayed from their shep-
herd and can no longer hear his guiding voice. And with-
out the realization of his guiding presence and loving care

132 Why Are We Here?
In politics there is fear of one party's or policy's being
dominated by another. There is fear of one class' ex-
ploiting another class. Among individuals there is often
fear of sickness, fear of poverty, even fear of old age.
All these fears arise from a lack of realization of the
Christ and His power, supply and rule. Probably 95%
of all man's fears never materialize, so only 5% ever have
to be faced.
Attitude Changed:
And once the Power of the Christ is realized, one is so
changed that he is no longer the same pÃµson who had the
fears. This changed attitude toward that which was
feared changes the whole course of one's life-stream
which seemed to be carrying him toward his fate. So even
though the 5% do materialize, they will not have the same
effect on him, and his reaction to them will be positive and
constructive instead of negative and supine.
Putting on Chriat:
But just how are you to learn to utilize the power of the
Christ within? What is this Christ within? It is your
personalized Rny of the Cosmic Christ. It is the perfect
Spiritual Being which is your Real Self. But just how are
you to "put on Christ"? . . . "for ye are all one in
Christ," as St. Paul tells us (Gal., iii, 28). This means
that you must claim the perfection of the Real or Christ-
self within. Then you can enter into the state of Christ-
consciousness, the realization of the Christ in you which
is waiting for recognition and expression. Then, like
Jesus, you must be about your Father's business. How?
By doing the work of the Christ in your everyday life and
affairs. This work is to purify, uplift and redeem the per-

result of your continual awareness of His presence within,
where He observes every action, word and even thought.
Allow no one to tell you that you are too imperfect, too
faulty, perhaps too sinful, too impure, too weak or too
insignificant to permit Him to express through you. For
if you waited until you felt worthy, you might never call
for His help.
Help Needed Now:
It is now, in your time of trial and temptation, that you
need His power to enable you to conquer whatever the
Great Law brings to you to be faced. For the Christ
within is not something that is abstract or latent. He is a
dynamic, expanding, radiating Presence actively seeking
ezpression through you. And since this Presence is an
individualized Ray of God Himself, He has the whole
power of God and the cosmos back of Him, just as every
tiniest ray of sunshine has the whole power of the Sun
behind it. All that is necessary to give you all the power
needed to revolutionize your life is to give Him active
expression.
Faith in Youraelf:
Therefore, never think of yourself as lacking in power.
For you have the whole power of the Cosmic Christ to
draw from. But to utilize that Power your first step is to
recognize that you already have it within you1 just waiting
to be called forth into expression. Never admit that per-
sons or things outside youfelf have power over you. To
do so is to deny the supremacy of the cosmic Power of the

the omnipotence of that Power you can say of all other
conditions: "None of these things move me."

Bodily Purification:
Something of the radiance of the Christ-light and Power
will seep through every sincere aspirant, but to let it flow
through your various bodies with uninterrupted freedom
you must first purify them. You must purify them not
only of their daily waste, but also of their accumulated
acids and toxins by special cleansing methods.2 Then you
must keep them from future accumulations by the use of
the right foods, and especially used in the right combina-
tions. If this is understood and practiced it will not be
necessary to "diet," but merely to use the right combina-
tions and proportions to produce the proper add-alkaline
balance.2
Responsive Bodies:
As your bodies are thus purified and fed on live and
vital foods properly combined, they become uplifted in
their rates of vibration, become stronger, possess greater
endurance and enable you to experience the joy of living.

can conquer all that comes to me today. I am strong
enough to bear every trial and to accept every joy, and to
say, 'Thy will be done."
" 1
And what joy of triumph and
overcoming you experience when you have conquered one
fault or failing!
Bodily Puriications
Something of the radiance of the Christ-light and Power
will seep through every sincere aspirant, but to let it tlow
through your various bodies with uninterrupted freedom
you must first purify them. You must purify them not
only of their daily waste, but also of their accumulated
acids and toxins by special cleansing methods? Then you
must keep them from future accumulations by the use of
the right foods, and especially used in the right combina-
tions. If this is understood and practiced it will not be
necessary to "diet," but merely to use the right combina-
tions and proportions to produce the proper acid-alkaline
balance?
Responsive Bodies:
As your bodies are thus purified and fed on live and
vital foods properly combined, they 'become uplifted in
their rates of vibration, become stronger, possess greater
endurance and enable you to experience the joy of living.
They also become more sensitive and responsive to the
Christ impulses from within. Your bodies are thus re-

deemed from their former bondage to sickness and suffer-
ing. And what joy of overcoming you experience when
you have conquered any inharmony the body may be
experiencing I Thus do you do the work of the Christ
(purify, uplift and redeem) in your body.
Refuse to Admit:
Secondly, you need to purify your mind by purging it of
all negative and destructive thoughts. This you can do
first by earnestly praying for, and responding to, the
mighty flow of peace, harmony and love from the Christ
within. Then keep the mind pure by refusing to admit
into it or responding to any thoughts that do not measure
up to the ideals you have set for the standard of your life.
For all thoughts presented to your mind are not necessarily
your thoughts. Many may come from the thought-
currents of the community surrounding you. But if you
admit them and dwell upon them then you make them
yours by adoption,, and thereby become responsible for
them.
Gossip:
If bits of gossip, which are usually derogatory, are
whispered to you, you should either refuse to listen or you
should neutralize them by relating very positively some-
thing constructive or complimentary about the person
mentioned. In fact, it is well to make a definite practice
of always looking for something complimentary or en-
couraging in all your friends and members of the family.
If something unkind is said or done, say or do something
ldnd to offset it and thus shame the doer. And in general,
whenever inharmony or criticism arises in the family or
social group, if you will start complimenting instead of
criticizing, you will revolutionize, uplift and redeem the
family and group life. Try it and see.

136 Why .Are We Here!
Temptation:
[f thoughts appear which tempt you from your duty or
your ideals, call upon the Christ within so to flood you
with realization of His presence and power that you will
lose all sight of the temptation. Hence it will no longer
occupy your attention or be a compelling factor in your
life.
What You Express:
Since you ultimately express that 'which you hold in
mind, if you long for a vision of heaven you must fix your
thoughts on heavenly things frequently, and give them
expression. This you can do by holding firmly within and
expressing positively your inner peace, harmony and hap.
piness. And as you radiate these forces dynamically and
persistently, others will feel your vibrations and respond
to them.
An Illustration:
For instance, as we entered a store recently a sales-lady
was just concluding with a customer who had evidently
caused a great deal of trouble, for the counter was piled
with goods she had been shown. She finally flounced
away with a disdainful air and some unldnd remark about
the goods and the service, and the sales-lady turned to us
with an impatient and irritated air, almost scowling. Had
we responded to her vibrations we would have called fin-
patiently for "service" or "attention." BÃ¹t as we did not
wish to take on her negative vibrations we maintained our
positive inner harmony and smiled at her instead. Then we
remarked: "It takes lots of patience to please some people,
doesn't it ?" Then she took on our positive and construc-
tive vibration, smiled and replied: "You're telling me?"
Thus we dispelled her irritation and cheered her probably
for the rest of the day, merely by refusing to respond to
her negativevibrations and positively radiating those we
chose to manifest.

Keep Poeltive:
But if you lose your consciousness of the inner peace
and harmony of the Christ within, you may become nega-
tive and readily take on the inharmonies of outer condi-
tions. Then those things do move you, often very much.
When dominated by those outer vibrations you may swear
that there is no such state as heavenly bliss. You may
react so inharmoniously that life and work seem a veritable
hell. But it is only the character of the thoughts and
reactions you permit to nanifeit through you that deter-
mines whether your life is a hell or a heaven.
Hell or Heaven:
Once realize this and you will discover that you can
transform the hell you have produced into the heaven you
desire by purifying your thoughts and refusing to react to
those which are negative. By so doing you raise the vibra-
tions of your mind and send out such powerful, con-
structive vibrations that you do the work of the Christ
(purifying, uplifting and redeeming) in your mental
world. And what joy of overcoming you experience
when you have consciously conquered one inharmonious
thought!
Emotional Control:
Thirdly, having purified, uplifted and redeemed your
body and mind, you need to do the same thing for your
emotions. First recognize that all the negative emotions,
such as anger, hatred, fear, jealousy, envy, etc., are not
your emotions, but those of the animal through which you
have to manifest. Therefore, when you find yourself
responding to inharmony or irritation, refuse to react to
them or they will grow into anger and hatred, and these
will poison not only your mind, but your body. Instead
say: "0 Christ, fill me with Thy peace and poise and
power 1"

138 Why Are We Here?
How to Conquer:
If fear assails you, immediately replace it with the
courage that is born of the realization of the mighty power
of the Christ within. If jealousy arises, replace it with
a realization that you have the immortal love of the Christ
within, and that therefore the lesser love and admiration
of others is not essential to your happiness.
Constructive Emotions:
Then you will respond at once to the constructive real-
ization that "God is Love"; and therefore the Christ
within is also love. Hold nothing else in mind. While
feeling and responding to His love you cannot be unloving
to any one or anything, for you rnnnnt feel love and
antagonism at the same time. One neutralizes and ex-
eludes the other. If some particular person does not
express as much love for you as you think he or she
should, you can realize that the Christ within loves you,
eveniftheparticularpersondoesnot. IfyouliveinHis
world of love, you are enfolded in that love and it protects
you from all else. For it knows no opposition or defeat.
Happiness From Within:
If you are unhappy, realize that your happiness does
not depend upon outer conditions or persons, but comes
from correlation with your Christ within. When you cease
to believe that your joy comes from external things, then
you are ready to respond to the joy that your oneness with
the Christ gives. That inner joy is constant and unchang-
ing, hence is unaffected by conditions and persons in the
outer world. Then you will cease to be swayed like a reed
in the wind by conditions outside yourself; for you can
still smile even though the Sun is not shining. Your joy
and happiness depend upon the degree of your realization
of the constant and unfailing inner joy of the Christ.
Therefore, cultivate that realization by meditating upon it
and by constant efforts to express it. Thus you do the
