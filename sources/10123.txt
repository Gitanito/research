The girl driving had passed another car in a curve at eighty mph. I remembering hitting a road sign and had blacked out. When I awoke, I was above looking down at my body with emergency medical technicians and other friends I knew. I spoke to someone asking, 'Why are they crying?' I don't know who it was that I spoke to, nor did I see them. The voice said they were crying over me because I was in a car accident. I kept asking, 'Why?' I didn't feel pain, actually I felt peaceful. Then I remembered waking up on the ground around the emergency medical technicians and friends.

While in the emergency room, the North Carolina State trooper approached me while I was waiting to be stitched up and said 'You should have been dead!' He said that the car went the distance of two football fields jumped two ditches and knocked a residents home off the foundation at a speed of eighty mph.
