  		              		Experience Description   

    Months prior to my experience, I had gone through an abortion. I dreaded my decision and actually contemplated suicide out of remorse and guilt feelings.  I struggled with how to forgive myself and how to move on in life trying to forget what I had done.  I spent  weeks of wishing death on myself and feeling undeserving of being able to live a full life, knowing I had taken a life. 
  
  Then an auto accident  was about to happen, unbeknownst to me.  I was leaving my mother's apartment and was heading back to my apartment.  I had planned a barbecue with numerous friends the week prior.  I was in a terrible auto accident. A huge boat of a vehicle rammed into my little flimsy car. The impact sent my face slamming into the steering wheel and actually bent it in half. I collided into the dashboard and broke it. It all happened so incredibly fast and I had a pair of sunglasses on that embedded into my right, upper brow. My face started to bleed profusely and I struggled to get out of the car. I feared it would catch on fire or explode because it was still revving in gear but not moving. I  watched another person who witness the accident and was set on getting out of my car to try and get his license plate number before he could drive away.  I couldn't figure out how to undo the seatbelt at first, because for some reason, I was attempting to unfasten it from the wrong side.  When I did managed to undo the seatbelt and open my door, I proceeded out of my car. I  took a step or two and my body went into shock.  I fell completely backwards with my head hitting the street with full force.

   The next thing I know, I am in a 'space.' It was not quite like a room with walls or doors but it was an open space. It was so warm and comfortable. The best words to describe it was a feeling of utter contentment and peacefulness. It was bright and vibrant.  God was there before me and I was delighted to see that God was holding my child. The baby was an infant and perfect in size and shape.  God spoke to me and said something to the effect of, 'Everything is good. He is perfect and I forgive you.  Do not feel guilty. You are forgiven and I love you.' I wish I could remember verbatim what was said. We communicated and I was able to touch and hold the baby.  I felt complete peace and forgiveness. I was ready to be with my child and embrace being a parent.  GOD told  me that he would watch over the baby and that he would be fine, but that I had to go back. He said that I would get to come back and be with my child in the future. But for now, I had a purpose and had to return.  I felt reluctant about leaving because I wanted to stay here in this beautiful, warm, comfortable peaceful place. And knowing that I was forgiven, made my heart swarm with 'warm fuzzy' feelings.  I said goodbye to my child,  kissed him, and handed him back to GOD. I recall the baby being wrapped in a soft, silky blanket. It was a pleasant goodbye. There was NO feeling of doom or sadness having to leave. I was overwhelmed with relief and felt rested and again a peaceful content feeling.   

  I was then looking down at my body and at the circumstances going on below me. The intersection and streets were completely blocked off. There were police vehicles,  ambulance, and many people in a circle around me. Someone was kneeling behind me and holding my head, someone was praying for me, people were chattering, and there was a lot of hustle and bustle going on. People were walking up from the beach, which was only a block away.   I could see ME, lying there in the middle of the street with all this commotion going on around me. I saw my favorite brand 'Guess' overalls drenched in blood. I remember thinking, 'Wow. How much time has passed that all of this has taken place since I fell to the ground?'  

  Then I smelled some strong scent of what ever was being held under my nose and I was back in my body. I felt really heavy and like I had been drugged or was in a very deep sleep.  I was TRYING to wake up, trying to open my eyes. My eyelids felt so heavy and I was not in any sort of pain. Then when I opened my eyes, it was like someone turned the muted volume on to high and everything was very loud and present.  I could comprehend the  young men who were telling each other my heart rate and my vitals. Someone asked me if I knew where I was, what the date was, and what my name was. All I could think about was, 'Are my teeth still there?'  All those years of braces and neck gear and my mouth felt like someone  punched me and that my teeth had fallen inwards.  I had swallowed a lot of blood; so much so, that they thought they were going to have to pump my stomach.   
    

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 May 1990  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes  Accident     Direct head injury.    Life threatening event, but not clinical death.   I was unconscious. My body was in one place while my Spirit was elsewhere. 
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes   I felt different things. This is so difficult to answer that question without all the details.   I could hear people praying for me, others having a conversation about the accident, medical terms were being used and police were assessing the situation, and talking to other people who saw the accident occur.
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I am usually a very private, modest person and I was completely naked (without clothing), and yet very aware and at peace. I felt completely comfortable and at ease. It was in no way distasteful or awkward. And I was in the presence of the Lord. This normally would have been completely uncomfortable and bizzare for me to experience.  
  
  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         1) When I was in the presence of GOD; and  2) when I saw myself and realized I was not actually IN my body but observing it from above.  I was about a flying kite's distance from the ground;  and 3) When I came to and heard everything louder and all at once.  
  
Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I have very blue eyes that ara extremely light-sensitive and yet when I was with Go,d it was extremely bright and yet it did not hurt or affect my vision or my eyesight.  I was extremely comfortable and able to look and communicate with my eyes being open.  
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, other then being able to have an audible conversation with God. It wasn't like it was telepathic. We were using our mouths to speak and it was a calm and comforting level of speech  
  
Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No       

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I actually saw them  

  Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes      I SAW GOD and my child, but neither were mystical. They were there before me. My child was alive and in human form.  God was in a human form out of kindness and for comfort to what I could see and accept.   I wouldn't say the baby was deceased because he was alive and moving in my sight.  Seeing as God is Jesus, then I saw Jesus. 
 
Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

  Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   Unearthly to me means extremely BRIGHT and warm but not harmful to my vision. I wasn't having to squint or it wan't painful to me to have my eyes open and be in the light.  
  
Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     

  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         I felt perfect contentment and strangely at ease and peace with the whole situation. I was aware of all my surroundings and safe  
  
Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Happiness  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about myself or others.     I understood that God was a loving, kind, forgiving God and wanted me to live without guilt and pain over a past experience that no longer held validity because my child was with him.  
  
  Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No     I became aware that God was aware that I had an abortion and I was actually verbally told that I was forgiven and to no longer feel guilty for my past  
  
Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life.   God told me I was not done and had a purpose to fulfil.  The purpose was never declared as to what it was, nor did I inquire  
  
God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Other Christian     

  Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I've grown stronger in my faith.  
  
What is your religion now?         Christian- Other Christian     

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience       

  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I now believe in GOD without a doubt. I don't know anyone else who has met God. I am intrigued by what others think or imagine what GOD is really like. I cringe when I hear people say GOD does not exist. It makes me sad to think they don't realize his intent  
  
Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

  Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         Yes   Jesus is the son of God and therefore 'The father, the son and the holy spirit' so seeing as I saw God,  I guess you would say I saw Jesus  too
  
During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I was made aware thta God was actually REAL. My encounter reassured me that this connection is possible and a reality  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I was able to meet God and speak to GOD.  
  
Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

  During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I would consider that special knowledge, I guess.  Or reconfirming what he already states in the bible.  It is only other people who hold the standards for the judging and hurtful thoughts against someone who has gone through this experience.  
  
During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.          I was informed that I would be coming back and that my child would continue living there without me but in the care of GOD  
  
  Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     I don't think God just forgives me for this act.  I feel like God wants others to know he loves and forgives them too and that they should not begrudge themselves or get caught up in the 'feelings' of guilt, remorse, pain and suffering. Without a doubt, he comes from complete and utter LOVE, COMPASSION,  UNCONDITIONAL LOVE,  and FORGIVENESS.  Even when we struggle with forgiving ourselves, he already has forgiven us.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     That God does not hold our past over our heads and begrudge us for mistakes or bad choices. He loves us unconditionally and forgives us without ANY ties or conditions  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     The love of my child was just as unconditional  
  
  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     I am very compassionate and emotionally sensitive to others and what is going on in their lives.  I am not so judgmental of others. I treat people with kindness and love. I set boundaries and keep toxic people at bay.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Uncertain   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I have very, vivid memory of strange things that occured.  
  
  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain     I wonder if I am an Empath.  I am very tuned in to my intutions, but I think I was before my accident too.  
  
  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The whole experience I think was pretty special. I have only started talking about it more openly with other people lately because I feel a nudging that I am supposed to share my story.  I am not quite sure why yet,  and why now after all these years.
  
  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    The day I got out of the hospital I told my mom.  It brought her to tears. I am not sure if she was influeneced by it.
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     It has been almost 28 years and I still can remember it as if it was last week.  I get very emotional when I speak about it. I no longer have any remorse about the decision I made and the experience I encountered brings Happiness to my heart.  
  
What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real       

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I would have to think about it. Some of the questions really were repetative and didn't leave 'other' options that were needed.
