First I heard and saw nothing anymore, then I seemed to be looking from the top of the room at my own body. I saw the doctors and the nurses fighting for my life. I heard what they said and I saw myself. I had a warm feeling and then I entered a tunnel. At the end of the tunnel was a bright warm white vibrating light it was beautiful and it gave me a very calm and reassuring feeling. I wanted to go to the light and I floated towards it. The warm feeling became more and more pleasant as I came closer to the light. Suddenly I felt again the pain of the accident, I was furious that the doctors had brought me back.
