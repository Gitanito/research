 This is the organ of the Adyar Theosophists in Cuba.  The journal started as the journal started as Revista Teosofica in September 1901 as the bulletin of the Havana lodge of the Theosophical Society in September, with a cover on which "the Sun is rising over Egyptian pyramids and Indian and Greek temples."   Not much came of this apparently, although it may have lasted until 1903, and again in June 1906 a journal on its exchange list notes that  Revista Teosofica has been begun as the organ of the Cuban Section of the Theosophical Society.  This lasted until "special economic circumstances" forced it to suspend publication in February 1916.  In February 1917 volume 1, number 1 of the journal (called "second series") appeared as the organ of the Cuban Section.  In 1928 "Cubana" was added to the title.  This appeared with some regularity until the late 1950s and then intermittently thereafter until the 1980s.  It then appeared in a new quarterly online series in 2014.  The journal was one of the standard production of TS sections and contained excerpts from Franz Hartmann, Vera P. Jelihovsky, Stanley B. Sexton (!), Rabindranath Tagore, Mario Roso de Luna, Jose Marti, C.W. Leadbeater, et al.  It notably re-printed the "New Stanzas of Dzyan" supposedly given by "M.M." (the Master Morya) to the Temple of the People.  The editor of the O.E. Library Critic, commenting on these new revelations, commented that "a comparison of these new 'Stanzas of Dzyan' with those given by H.P.B. would indicate that either the book or the Initiates have undergone a sad deterioration."
