hello Dr Greer hello Pat how are you
doing today good good so Dr Greer you
have a lecture coming up that&#39;s um
pretty important for the
um actually for the energy of the world
so would you like to talk about this a
little bit and let us know what what&#39;s
going on
yes I mean this is October 25th and uh
the event is sold out in Santa Monica
Auditorium however uh
you can get on and do the webinar it&#39;s
going to be a two-hour uh special that
is also going to be filmed as the sort
of underlying uh backbone of this new
feature film we&#39;re working on called The
Lost century and the subtitle of that is
and how to reclaim it
so this is going to be an expose like
there has never been done on the Exotic
Technologies of the last 100 years that
uh could save the biosphere and uh
eliminate poverty globally within 20
years if they could be disclosed or
brought forward so that&#39;s what this is
going to be focused on and it&#39;s it&#39;s
really geared towards uh without going
too much into science and physics that
the public wouldn&#39;t understand uh unless
you&#39;re a physicist of the the evidence
for these Technologies and we&#39;re going
to basically review all the way back
more than 100 years ago when there were
some of these Technologies being
developed and what happened to them and
all the way up to this is a big breaking
news I want to announce the fact that
our team has now identified in the last
few months for a currently operation all
devices that are solid state any one of
which would be a complete Game Changer
on the planet if they could be a
properly and and rather massively
disclosed so we&#39;ll be hearing about that
also on uh at this presentation
you know all of everybody just needs to
understand our these films that we&#39;re
doing are all crowdfunded which means
that it&#39;s through the contributions of
the public that we&#39;re able to do them so
we hope you&#39;ll go there should be a link
here underneath this YouTube site
um uh header that you can go to to
contribute to the crowdfunding because
we want to raise at least five hundred
thousand dollars to do this uh feature
film and also we&#39;ll probably need an
equal amount to get the word out about
it so anybody who&#39;s listing me if you if
you can give a very small amount it
would be very helpful also if you want
to be part of the webinar uh there&#39;s not
a limit on that per se uh technically
there could be but we really want people
to be part of that for those who can&#39;t
make it in the auditorium on October
25th and there&#39;s a link also for the uh
signing up for that webinar also so
really what the big announcement is here
is that as things progress here in
Washington where I am right now uh we
need to be able to connect some dots for
the public but also the politicians who
are looking into the UFO issue and one
of the things I always point out when I
go into a meeting is that uh I will
reference the the all the footage that
the Pentagon has confirmed as being an
actual physical object uh such as those
UFO tapes UAP tapes taken off the coast
of California seeing people call it the
Tic Tac
a UFO and I point out that look at that
there&#39;s no their infrared sensors from
from the Jets and on board the ship
indicates there&#39;s no Jets no Rockets no
source of heat so even if there was a
small say nuclear uh
power plant on board but that certainly
would have a big Heat Signature so what
is it how is it moving uh straight up
and down and against a very strong uh
headwind at that altitude how is it
maneuvering well I always point out to
strip away all the
sort of jargon-laden and Sensational
alien stuff for a minute and just look
at it objectively it&#39;s an alternative
energy and propulsion device and it&#39;s
ours that is not an extraterrestrial
vehicle so one of the things that we
have to educate the public on is that
the good news is that the solutions we
need to give ourselves an entirely new
planet like the ET that that was with
Colonel corso and he said what&#39;s in it
for me and the ET said a new world if
you can take it a new world that was
1956. now you know here we are whatever
it is a 68 67 whatever 66 years later
and we&#39;re in a situation where we didn&#39;t
take it uh there were all kinds of
covert interests that circled their
wagons around Eisenhower and stopped
this information from coming out but
even before that and the era of JP
Morgan and other big industrialists in
the early 20th century they had
submarine uh the work of Nikola Tesla
because people need to understand he had
no important clip but he had other
devices including a car
that ran with no need to plug it in
off the energy that it was pulling out
from the environment now
Tesla refer to this is infinite energy
field years later Professor Dirac called
it the Dirac C other people had been
Quantified it with a doctor a professor
Casimir in the 50s as the Zero Point
Energy field other people refer to it as
the quantum flux field
what is clear is that there is a huge
abundance of energy in the space
embedded in the space around us and I
don&#39;t mean outer space I mean the space
where you&#39;re sitting and the amount of
energy density
is estimated that the amount of space
inside a coffee cup that much volume has
enough potential energy to boil off all
the oceans on the planet it&#39;s an
enormous amount of energy so people have
been experimenting with very high
frequency of high voltage systems for
since the late 1800s some people think
even the very early Estates of
electromagnetism and there were some
unusual phenomena
and this phenomenon resulted in an
excess gain of energy and power out than
they had to put in
which is many people saw us violating
the laws of third my Dynamics it is not
the the second law of Thermodynamics who
says that you know it has to be its
energy is conserved and it has what&#39;s in
and out because what&#39;s not being
calculated is this energy field uh that
is all around us that has been
Quantified for over 60 years and almost
70. and uh and scientifically
established to exist now what the
mainstream science doesn&#39;t think is
possible is that you could actually
utilize that energy that yes it exists
but we don&#39;t know how to tap it well
that&#39;s not true because the people who
haven&#39;t made inventions over the last
hundred years who have
in many cases stumbled across this
I always point out empiricism is the
mother of science meaning direct
observation
so many of the biggest breakthroughs in
history scientifically have been almost
like chance observation when somebody&#39;s
fiddling with something or even an
accident that happens
uh that&#39;s true in medicine it&#39;s true in
physics and and Engineering also so I
think that when you begin to look at the
history of this you begin to also then
have to ask the question where have they
all gone I estimate there have been
several thousand quote-unquote free
energy devices and I&#39;m going to use that
term not meaning that it&#39;s coming out of
nowhere but it&#39;s coming from this very
vast virtually infinite field of energy
around us and that those devices have
all met
uh a dead end in terms of getting out to
the public why
so what we&#39;re going to explore in this
two-hour presentation and also uh
document and prove in the movie is that
these Technologies
excuse me these technologies have
existed but they are very powerful and
corrupt interests both private and
Industrial and governmental that collude
with each other to be sure these
Technologies don&#39;t get out and upset the
apple card of the several hundred
trillion dollar oil gas coal electric
utility grid uh nuclear power solar wind
um plug-in electric cars all these are
obsolete I mean I know everyone thinks
they&#39;re being very virtuous uh with
their uh solar and what have you and I
have the largest and I&#39;m just in full
disclosure I have at my farm in Virginia
the largest legally allowed solar farm
it allowed in the state by law bigger
than that we&#39;d have to be a commercial
operator
and a few months ago in the winter
we had about a foot of very heavy wet
snow took down millions of trees in the
area we were without power for an entire
week
so this system it&#39;s a over 80 000 system
which you know I took from my retirement
savings to put in
um because I you know was wanting to do
something to help with this situation
before we bring these Technologies out
we have to do some Bridge Technologies
but everyone listening listen very
carefully
that system which is the largest legally
allowed system in the world that costs
that much money would not heat the house
for an hour we could have water and we
could have lights and we could have hot
water and the refrigerator that&#39;s it now
that is not us the energy density just
is not there meaning energy density the
amount of power for that size and
expense just isn&#39;t going to run planet
Earth with 8 billion people and it&#39;s too
little too late so all the solutions
being proposed by the fossil fuel of
devotees you just say let&#39;s drill more
and burn more
uh that&#39;s destroying the biosphere
leaving half the world in poverty and
all the people who say well we have this
solution we just have to spend trillions
on this that&#39;s not going to work either
because they&#39;re not calculating the fact
that most of the pollution happening on
Earth is not in Europe and America it&#39;s
in the developing world and in China and
India and those countries cannot afford
120 000 or 80 000 Tesla car or an eighty
thousand dollar solar panels in their
Meadow so I think that we have to have
some compassion not only for the Earth
but the people of the earth that aren&#39;t
as lucky to and fortunate to live in the
rich countries like Europe and America
and Japan because the other big problem
that stalking humanity and the reason
why we never get into a peaceful
situation is this sort of zero-sum game
of wealth and commodities that
everyone&#39;s fighting over look what&#39;s
going on with the energy crisis now uh
Europe is looking at a cutoff of gas
from Russia that&#39;s going to leave their
homes and factories freezing this winter
um now this is ridiculous when it&#39;s 100
years on that we haven&#39;t needed those
fossil fuels at all
so this has become a huge crisis for
Humanity and I think that this is why we
want to do this urgently so that the
public understands that if we can create
a mass movement
to develop these sources and release
them open source meaning no patent no
intellectual property Secrets no secret
sauce it&#39;s it&#39;s released now
the very good news is that we know this
is possible uh to create these systems
because you know Pat you and I were out
in the desert at a place uh about a
month ago
and we saw out there in a little
building out in the desert a device that
was about the size of a large shoe box
had four magnesium alloy plates uh the
startup system was a tiny three volt
battery which you could take out after
it&#39;s going and it had been sitting there
for two years putting out three
kilowatts of power continuously and we
moved it up to five kilowatts of power
and we document it you&#39;re going to see
it in this film now there are other
devices also that we have had people
visit and that we&#39;re working uh on the
big problem is the inventors and the
investors in those systems
have made every predictable mistake that
will guarantee they never get to the
public
and and they have tried to patent them
they kept it secret
a couple of these devices have software
attached to them that if you try to
figure out how it works it would destroy
it
now this I call this this sort of
delusional inventor syndrome where the
inventors think somehow they&#39;re going to
Outfox the secret government programs
and also be able to monetize it like you
would a new software package what
they&#39;re not calculating is that they are
a very small David up against a massive
Goliath a massive of headwind that&#39;s
going against them in the form of covert
programs as well as corporate interests
and the corporate interests are actually
nastier than the government ones because
those guys are up against something they
don&#39;t realize is out there so we&#39;re
going to also expose how people&#39;s
devices have been confiscated
uh and we&#39;re going to use documents to
prove it we&#39;re going to show a patent
office National Security letter that one
of these inventors got
we&#39;re going to show the Department of
Defense Pentagon letter that was to the
FBI demanding that they turn over the
seas secret papers of Nikola Tesla that
they grabbed the day he died we have
that document we&#39;re going to show
um the testimony and the history of a
number of these devices and how some of
these people have been assassinated and
killed uh others have had uh large
buyouts where a big corporate interest
buys it and then we put it we call it
black shelving where you put it on a
shelf and bury it take it take it out of
the possibility of the public having it
there are so many there&#39;s at least a
dozen strategies that have been used
over the last hundred years to be sure
these Technologies never see the light
of day
and they&#39;ve been effective otherwise you
and I would be running our cars on an
electric motor that would have a tiny
little battery
and a device that runs an electric motor
and it would never have to be charged in
this is not some utopian fantasy
um the Floyd Suite device for example he
had something the size of a cigarette
pack
that could attach to an electric motor
generator
for 300 horsepower engine in your car
and when he was moving with some folks
at General Motors to get that out he was
killed so
I think people need to understand uh as
Einstein correctly is attributed to have
said that the definition of insanity is
doing the same thing over and over
expecting a different result so what we
are doing is documenting how these
Technologies uh work in Lay terms
how they&#39;ve come and gone what the
tricks are what the landmines are out
there that everyone steps on and gets
blown up by but then we&#39;re going to show
what the strategy is what strategy would
actually frustrate these petronazis and
fascists that are destroying the planet
simple
but difficult at the same time a concept
is actually quite simple it&#39;s doing an
Aikido where you flip their dark energy
into disclosure and Light it&#39;s like the
national reconnaissance office above
their headquarters and this office runs
all the secret satellites it says We Own
the Night
and I told people we need to own the
light
and the light of disclosure
but to do it you&#39;re going to have to
have two things line up
someone who can bring forward or fund a
lab to create a preferably solid-state
device which is what these are that
we&#39;re going to be showing that that
exist right now on the planet right this
minute as I&#39;m speaking
and put them out there with all the
plans no hold back the intellectual
property and no patent so it is open
source and anybody who is an engineer or
a company that wants to reproduce it can
do so and improve on it then that way it
in it will be a very rapid uh you&#39;ll
have generation two three four five ten
within a couple of years the other thing
that we have to do however is to do that
widely what do I mean it means that you
meet we have to reach between one and
two billion people
why is that because if it&#39;s only known
by a few thousand or a few hundred
thousand aficionados of new energy free
energy and UFOs that&#39;s not going to
change the dynamic and it&#39;s not going to
protect it so the only way to do it is
to have a strategy and that&#39;s why we&#39;re
doing the Lost Century because if if it
can be
as close to or better than
unacknowledged which has had 760 million
people
uh see it which has led to all the
things going on in Washington right now
this could be create a mass movement for
people who are concerned about energy
Independence the environment World
poverty the future of our civilization
on Earth it could create the same kind
of momentum that would lead to these
Technologies being disclosed open source
um yeah you have to combine both open
sourcing release of it meaning no hold
back on information with all the
information disclosed not partially
uh which many of these inventors will
will release everything but the secret
sauce and then when people go to make it
it doesn&#39;t work and I I&#39;ve spoken to
many of them like that many and it&#39;s
done deliberately because they&#39;re trying
to protect uh the monetization the the
money that they see their devices worth
what they don&#39;t realize is that they
would make a thousand times more money
if they had it massively disclosed and
open source because there are companies
like GitHub which is a software company
is a multi-billion dollar company
the other thing that we&#39;re going to
point out is that the task is so huge
Pat we have right now on the road one
and a half billion with a B Motor
Vehicles
but we have discovered there&#39;s a device
that with one percent gasoline and 99
water
will run every car in the world without
it being retrofitted well no it says 99
water and one percent gasoline
that&#39;s what I meant to say 99 water one
percent gasoline it doesn&#39;t need the
gasoline at all except that the little
bit of or gas in it protects the uh
spark plugs and some of the other
components in the engine from rusting so
uh but that&#39;s a transition that could
happen immediately and guess what the
the exhaust is
oxygen and water vapor and the water
gets recycled back into the water that&#39;s
needed so this is a technology that
we&#39;ve also recently discovered
unfortunately it does have a patent on
it that I&#39;m sure is only a partial
disclosure of it
um there&#39;s a so what I&#39;m saying is that
if we can create the the the
knowledge in the public
so that then builds where we can then
either create an energy research lab
which would be expensive or have
somebody come forward willing to
cooperate with this strategy and what I
tell people who are concerned about that
if anyone&#39;s listening
in the first phase of this we have to
release it open source because it
protects everybody working in the field
because it&#39;s no longer a secret
academic institutions and other
companies will reproduce it
it in other words will be proven instead
of being under a mess which is why we do
disclosure project on the UFO issue but
on top of that on phase two after you
release it open source phase two of it
this is when you get into developing
specific products
so any one of these device one any one
of these Technologies it could be
applied to run a refrigerator
your house a business scaled up scaled
down miniaturized so your phone that
always goes dead and you have you have
to find a place to plug it in or your
computer goes dead anything that is now
running on a battery would have a very
small miniaturized version of one of
these solid state systems we&#39;re never
going to have to plug it in so there are
literally millions and I&#39;m not
exaggerating of applications
and those can all be once you take a
fundamental science
like a basic science like this then
those can at the second phase in the
third phase those can be
monetized you can even create patents
around it because it doesn&#39;t matter the
underlying physics and science is out so
I think people have to understand that
there&#39;s a real a lot of thought that&#39;s
gone behind this strategy and it&#39;s also
a lot of School of Hard Knocks you know
I personally have lost over a million
dollars uh
looking into these Technologies and
going down the path and trying to work
with people who have these very poorly
thought through business legal
strategies that where each time they
step into the legal trap the financial
trap the patent trap and you know even
if they don&#39;t step into those the
devices get confiscated their offices
get bombed they&#39;re killed whatever it is
so I think that we have to find a way to
do this because it&#39;s literally saving
the planet and Humanity from a very
rapidly approaching
potential extinction level event where
the biosphere the oceans are so damaged
that they won&#39;t be recoverable now we
know that these other civilizations out
in Space the Extraterrestrial
civilizations are very concerned about
this many people have had contact they
hear consistently this message that&#39;s a
very specific environmental message and
warning they warn about two big things
the weapons of mass destruction and
thermonuclear weapons and the rate of
destruction of our biosphere the air the
land the species extinctions the oceans
Etc so this is a consistent a message
that&#39;s been coming through
um for over 60 years 70 years that we
can document but
they&#39;re not going to swoop down and
invade the Earth and fix it for us so
the expectation is we&#39;re the children of
birth this is our planet and we need to
through our own volition and Collective
positive good action change this because
if an outside force swoops in and lands
and does it it&#39;s first of all going to
be portrayed by the warlockers as an
alien invasion and secondly it would be
about as effective as us invading
Afghanistan for 20 years and expecting
us to dominate that culture and then we
leave and it&#39;s been transformed into a
Jeffersonian democracy well it hasn&#39;t
been transformed I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s back
to Warlords and terrorists so we&#39;re you
know a civilization and a culture has to
learn these lessons on their own uh the
the the interstellar civilizations are
just wanting to be in place in case we
really do blow the system
or uh worse Escape out in the space
beyond our solar system using covert uh
Energy Systems and and technologies that
could be a threat to other innocent
planets because the human situation is
considered about something very unstable
which it is if you look at it
objectively
so this the Lost century and how to
reclaim it
we have to document the Lost century and
the science and prove these this is the
case but we then have to provide how do
you reclaim it I call this a Time snap
where if we align properly with right
action and with the right strategy boom
10 20 years we make up for 100 years
of lost Evolution uh and if you look at
the photographs of what happened during
the lockdowns in covet or some of the
large blackouts in the Northeast United
States some years ago the earth the air
in the water clears up very quickly the
Earth has the ability to heal herself
but we have to stop abusing the Earth
and for that to happen we&#39;re going to
have to come up with an entirely new
uh Paradigm for energy which is frankly
decentralized and one of the big issues
here and this gets one of the core
issues of the secrecy it&#39;s not just the
hundreds of trillions of dollars that
are invested in the power grid and
utilities and oil and gas and coal and
nuclear Etc
it&#39;s also that if every village in
Africa or Asia or Latin America or Iowa
could have its own source of energy
it means that power literally you know
Energy power that runs your house goes
back to the people but actual power
political and Social Power devolves from
this these huge Global Elite corporate
and governmental folks
to the local level because they derive a
lot of their power through the macro
economic system the global system that
requires that everyone be dependent on
this super you know the super tanker
lines coming from the Middle East or
other places or pipelines or what have
you right and it also would solve
another big problem and that&#39;s the fact
that half the world&#39;s population doesn&#39;t
even have indoor plumbing and three
billion listen to this number three
billion people according to the
economist
do not have any way to cook their food
without cutting down old growth
rainforest or shrubs in the desert this
is why we&#39;re losing so much of that most
people think it&#39;s due to Big lumber
companies
um Timber it isn&#39;t most of it is due to
the subsistence of existence of small
farmers and people trying to cook trying
to make charcoal that&#39;s three billion
people
but there&#39;s another problem and that is
the social injustice and the instability
globally of having a system and one of
the things I&#39;ve pointed out for 30 years
the current Energy System requires
half the world be in poverty let me
repeat that the system we have today of
oil gas called nuclear Public Utilities
transmission lines gasoline cars
absolutely requires half the world to be
in poverty why
if those four three to four billion
people who don&#39;t have electricity and
air conditioning and cars and a way even
to cook their food
suddenly live the way you and I do
the price of again of a barrel of oil
would be a thousand dollars it&#39;d be
twenty Thirty forty fifty dollars a
gallon or more at the pump even
middle-class people in America could not
fill up their vehicles why because
there&#39;s only so much Supply and if we
were to allow the demand to meet where
it should be so other people lived
decently
you think the price of gas and oil and
and your electric bill is high now it&#39;d
go up orders of magnitude so the system
is a virtually very cruel that it
requires
the poverty of half the denizens the
citizens of Earth so this is something
we very much need to think about also
from a human compassion point of view
any way you look at it
it needs to be done now what&#39;s the
downside
there will be economic uh and uh
employment displacement for those who
work in those energy sectors but that
can be accounted for because the it&#39;s
not going to happen overnight this is
not like a an app that you download in
10 seconds this is a heavy industry and
you it will take 15 to 20 years
just to convert the two and a half
billion homes on the planet to this kind
of system the one and a half billion
Motor Vehicles
think about the fact that at Peak
production we create a hundred million
cars a year globally if it at that pace
of maximum production
currently
it would take 15 years for vote for them
to be replaced all these gas and diesel
trucks and cars
so it&#39;s going to be over a period of
time but from everything I&#39;m hearing
from folks in homeland security and and
intelligence folks
the word is calling up the balloon&#39;s
gone up that we probably don&#39;t have 10
years
before we reach the Tipping Point
environmentally geophysical stability
and else other problems so we need to
hurry up so the other thing that this
film is going to do and I can&#39;t be too
specific about it but there are people
in the U.S government at the very
highest level of
interest who are trying to get to the
bottom of the UFO issue who want a large
expose on this issue as well as perhaps
next year if we have time to do it
another uh disclosure project press
conference so that the people who are in
governments around the world can be
pointed to this because now they&#39;re
ready to hear it again right
um so that&#39;s another reason why this
film we&#39;re trying to get it finished so
that it can come out in the spring of
2023 but that&#39;s a very big undertaking
and we need your help we need you to
make contributions if you know people
who have these devices write to our
website
seriousdisclosure.com sir
iusdisclosure.com because we would like
to find one inventor and we we have a
number of very high net worth people
that if we found someone willing to the
inventor and the investors to be
compensated and in exchange for us being
able to release it open source without
any secrets we have not found that
device yet the ones we have found are
all encumbered with frankly lame brain
foolish strategies that are the same
strategies I&#39;ve seen for 32 years I mean
remember I I was dealing with Bruce De
Palma with the end machine it became the
tawari system uh back in 1991.
and I have seen dozens and dozens of
these devices and the people who hold
them make exactly the same scripted
mistakes one after another because
there&#39;s no learning curve because they
don&#39;t know each other so what we want to
also do with this film in two hours is a
lot to do is to explain why people
working on these Technologies need to
consider the big missing element they
never think of everyone thinks if you
have like one group I knew had a hundred
million dollars in an operational system
and they vanished they&#39;re gone
this has happened over and over and over
so you had all the money in the world
and all the of the best solid-state
technology could have something that
would sit on your coffee table and run
your house forever without any electric
bill and no pollution
it&#39;s not going to get out if you have
the wrong strategy to get it out
and if you are and I think this is a big
problem everyone underestimates the
adversary here the Petro Nazis these are
the people who run the planet these are
the people who have endless wealth these
are the people who are not afraid to
kill people or set them up for false
arrest or flat out have a black bag
operation go in and sabotage the lab or
vomit or seize it so we have to be
realistic about
you&#39;ve got to get out of this Pollyanna
mindset I think this is Pollyanna
naivete that well I have a better
mousetrap the world&#39;s going to be the
path to my door
in reality murder Incorporated is going
to beat a path to your door
and this is the thing that none of these
engineers and Engineers consider so that
is something we have to educate the
engineering and scientific Community
this is not like just discovering
another drug or another uh software
application or no this is the
fundamental
um system that runs the whole planet is
the petrodollar oil gas called electric
grit all of that it is the Baseline of
the entire modern civilization that
will have to be replaced
but anyone making a challenge to those
vested cartels and interests you&#39;re
walking into the mother of all Buzz saws
and you&#39;re going to get chopped to
pieces
if you don&#39;t do it right and there is a
way to do it now this has taken me 32
years frankly through the School of Hard
Knocks and observation uh and direct
hands-on experience to make the
statements I&#39;m making here today but the
very good news is there are at least
four of them that we have discovered in
the last few months that we&#39;re going to
feature in this documentary that are
currently operational on the planet and
there are many others we&#39;ll show going
back 100 years that have existed and
then finally one of the most exciting
things about this film I think and the
presentation on October 25th
those of you who can be there by the
webinar will see this or in person is
we want to be able to show what the
world looks like
20 years from now 50 years from now 100
years from now a thousand years from now
and we&#39;re actually investing in some
Motion Graphics and uh illustrations
that would show what is it what does the
city look like in the future what does
transportation look like and what is the
Earth itself in terms of the purity of
the air and water what about places that
are inhospitable well you could have a
very large Dome or structure because the
energy to heat and cooling keep it at an
optimal temperature be free once you
have the system in and you could also
get water from the air
because you can you can dehumidify and
get water you can buy those now but they
take a lot of electricity but the if the
electricity is coming from this infinite
energy field guess what even the desert
shall Bloom it&#39;s like the saying in the
Bible
um and you could have a productive
agriculture organic at the North Pole in
the Sahara Desert or anywhere or in
where it&#39;s winter doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s
winter if you can control the
temperature over the area where you&#39;re
doing product those uh you know growing
of substances and uh of plants and wheat
and whatever it is
so that is a game changer for micro
farming
where people could have in their area a
robotically controlled uh with the
digital Technologies we have now place
where the food stuffs that are needed
locally or grown locally but at very
very low cost
now let&#39;s look at Manufacturing most of
the energy that goes into everything you
buy is the energy
to dig it up out of the ground ship it
to a place to be manufactured you&#39;re the
processing of it shipping the
manufactured process product but if all
this begins to be able to do like 3D
printing but where you could have
manufacturing using these high-tech
systems so many things instead of being
made you know 10 000 miles away and then
shipped over to Washington or California
it would be done locally so there&#39;d be a
revolution in manufacturing which would
also give enormous numbers of jobs so I
estimate that for every job loss in the
current energy sector there would be 10
to 20 high-tech new jobs
and abundance now in between you&#39;re
going to have to have some programs to
retrain those folks and also to
financially assist them but it&#39;s worth
it save the planet I mean look the
United States spent 10 trillion dollars
with the lockdown cost for for covid so
when we need to do something like this
we can do it and so we could be
compassionate about the people who are
you know work on oil rigs or work at the
public utility or alignsmen for the
Republic utility but again all that&#39;s
going to change over about a 15 20-year
period that you don&#39;t snap your fingers
and suddenly get rid of everything that
exists that&#39;s running the entire planet
so there&#39;s time there&#39;s time to phase
that in but because we&#39;d squandered this
lost century
we don&#39;t have time to waste uh we don&#39;t
have another Century I will guarantee
you that
we might have 20 years and so we&#39;re now
at the point uh where and this is An
Inconvenient Truth
I say that rather
uh smiling because back when uh Bill
Clinton and Al Gore were President and
Vice President uh I wanted the close
friends of the vice president Al Gore
who famously did that movie and
Inconvenient Truth and presents himself
as an avid environmentalist
uh I met with his science advisor Dr
kohlenberger and put on a silver platter
literally
literally the solution to the
environmental problem all this
information and patents and and details
about how a number of them work
turned their back on it too dangerous
too many powerful vested interests and
lobbyists and too many people funding
the politicians who are in those sectors
of the economy and so you know I really
am quite aggravated with people who like
describing the problem but turn their
back on the solution I think the people
of the United States but around the
world need to hold their uh the
governments accountable and this is why
this film also should be put in front of
every elected official and say all right
we&#39;re now spending trillions of dollars
on solutions that aren&#39;t going to work
whether it&#39;s cap and trade solar wind
you know with all the work we&#39;ve done
since the 70s when solar and when it&#39;s
12 of the electricity now 12 and that&#39;s
in a rich country like America you go to
other countries it&#39;s virtually
infinitesimally zero uh and let&#39;s not
forget the entire
European Union in the United States is
only about 10 percent of a global
population
so if you&#39;re looking at it globally I
mean let&#39;s face it the air and the water
and the oceans were all one Globe it&#39;s
not like just because it&#39;s a
geopolitical boundary between Finland
and Russia that if something&#39;s going on
in Russia into the air it&#39;s not going to
affect the rest of the world I mean that
we have to look you know go look at the
pictures of the Earth from space there
aren&#39;t any walls between these countries
so if other developing countries are
slashing and burning rainforest and and
there are hundreds of new coal-fired
power plants being built in the
developing world without scrubbers like
we have in the United States and Europe
they&#39;re very dirty and I think that the
other thing that people don&#39;t realize is
that the people who don&#39;t believe in
global warming fine
but 8.6 million people a year die from
the particulate matter the air pollution
from oil and coal and gas
and that&#39;s 8.6 million per year that is
more people than died in the Holocaust
and all World War II every single year
now these are facts you can look them up
and so to fix the problem it&#39;s I liken
this to a global Marshall Plan
where you know after World War II the
Marshall Plan was where we rebuilt
Europe
um but it was just a little small part
of Europe
which is a very small part of the world
and now we&#39;re talking the entire planet
being retrofitted renovated
in their entire Energy System and this
is why another point I make to these
inventors is that the task is so huge
that if you had hundreds of companies
the size of Amazon or Apple or Google or
Tesla Motors it really would scarcely be
enough
uh because it&#39;s heavy industry it&#39;s not
just pressing clacking everyone thinks
we&#39;re making such progress because we
can click clack on our phones and do
something but the energy running this
phone is coming from a coal-fired power
plant over here right like in the 1800s
so you can go back a hundred and some 30
years 140 years
and you will see that whether it&#39;s the
Mercedes making the first internal
internal combustion engine for a car
and look at your car out here it&#39;s
fancier it&#39;s more refined it has
computers on it but the Basic Energy
that&#39;s running the car hasn&#39;t changed
since 1888. this is 2022. so
we&#39;re talking way more than a century
almost one and a half centuries uh so I
think that the other thing is that we
have to be able to say collectively as
the people
the people who have been the
industrialists and who were at the roots
of industrial fascism in the late 1800s
and early to mid 20th century you&#39;ve had
150 years to ruin the planet now it&#39;s
time for the people to fix it and we&#39;re
not going to be intimidated and in fact
we&#39;re going to be smart about it because
now with imagine if we have a laboratory
with one of these devices being studied
and everything about it&#39;s released in
real time blockchain or some system
where it can&#39;t be taken down
and at each refinement it just keeps
getting released to the public massively
but the problem is how do you make sure
that it gets out massively this is where
we another appeal I&#39;m making today if
you or someone you know is a
influencer
or a uh social media has a large number
of followers or celebrity
this is when we need them to step in why
because the Washington Post the New York
Times Fox news CNN
uh the BBC they will not cover this
why because they are vertically and
horizontally integrated into these
Financial interests
so
we&#39;re going to have to find creative
ways to do it the big internet companies
Will Shadow band it so like when we put
out something like the cosmic hoax you
can put that in it doesn&#39;t even show up
on the algorithm because it&#39;s been
Shadow banned and put down now the the
search Rhythm as search algorithms
now the only way around that is to have
people who have enough direct followers
I mean I have some million or so but
there are ones that have a hundred
million or 150 million all of those need
to help us get the film out we also need
them to help us raise the money for the
film by dropping a link which you can
drop the link is here that you&#39;ll see
underneath this interview
and then we also need them when we get
one of these things working
imagine if you had 20 of 20 A-list
celebrities and influencers who want to
see the environment saved running their
house and driving their car with one of
these and they&#39;re dropping every day
Instagram and uh Twitter and Facebook
images and information you can&#39;t put
that Genie back in the bottle
so that&#39;s why we need more and more
people like that coming forward we have
a number already but we need dozens who
will actually do that because that is
how you do a workaround around the
Embargo of this information uh that the
mainstream media and even the big tech
companies that pretend to be so
enlightened you know it&#39;s just like the
same they say about Hollywood
um they all act like hippies but behave
like Nazis
you know they all pretend to be hippies
but they behave like Nazis
um you know this sort of like hypocrisy
um so I think that we&#39;re going to have
to also
find more and more people willing to to
do that
right you know the one the devices that
we know about right now uh if the if the
inventor group would listen they would
let us run with it uh open source and
also the disclosure of it not only
through this documentary in a press
conference but also with celebrities I
mean there are so many celebrities like
uh Leonardo DiCaprio his whole life is
dedicated now to the environment I am
quite sure he would be happy to have a
car running on a free energy device and
to have his house running on one of
these I&#39;m certain of it I know people
who know him so I don&#39;t have it but I&#39;m
they&#39;re I&#39;m sure hundreds of people like
that and in the aggregate they&#39;d reached
a couple of billion people so that
strategy is very important it&#39;s not for
the salacious or fame or whatever per se
it&#39;s because they can actually be a
multiplier effect in getting this
knowledge and information out when we&#39;re
facing a corrupt media and a corrupt
government and corrupt large corporate
structures
so that&#39;s another part of the strategy
and we need help with that too I&#39;m sure
there are people listening you&#39;ll say oh
I know so and so I just heard from a
wonderful man the other day who was the
lead singer for Limp Biscuit and and he
was like he wants to really do this
um Jamie Foxx came up to me when I was
in LA last time just loving what we&#39;re
working on I think we have to find
people who can help be a multiplier of
our voices who have that kind because
that&#39;s that you have a lot of power and
responsibility when you can reach that
many people so that&#39;s one thing I&#39;d ask
people to do so we need your help if
you&#39;re an inventor or know an inventor
to have one of these systems get hold of
us immediately but we&#39;re going to close
production at by the end of the year and
this is already mid-october
um
if you&#39;re no you if you or someone you
know is an influencer with half a
million or more followers that can help
us get the word out please contact us
um if you uh have can help us
fund the crowdfunding for the film
I think we just announced it a couple
days ago I think we&#39;re at one percent
but we want to get to 100. uh please
make a contribution even if it&#39;s five
dollars or ten dollars or a thousand
doesn&#39;t matter whatever you can do
please help us do it because one of the
reasons we crowdfund these just to be
clear
is that we do not want an investor or a
corporate media Corporation editing out
the truth that&#39;s why we did serious
unacknowledged and Close Encounters of
the fifth kind and the cosmic hopes
through crowdfunding
um and we want to do it that way because
it&#39;s it maintains the purity of the
message and the narrative and it doesn&#39;t
get edited by uh corrupt influences
which I know this sounds rather cynical
but I view the money people as always
easily corrupted and 100 of what we
raise goes into the quality of the
production and getting the word out
about 100
so uh that&#39;s and because we don&#39;t have
an office or staff I mean so it&#39;s all
going to the production and the research
and all of that so you know it&#39;s not
like a lot of these things you you give
money to and 90 of it goes to
administrative CEOs that make two
million a year that&#39;s what&#39;s going on
here folks
um you know we need people who actually
help us uh and we need it fairly quickly
because this is going to be a very
expensive production
um it is already I mean we&#39;re all
already a couple hundred thousand
dollars in
um but no Revenue just basically taken
out of savings but that&#39;s what we need
you to help with as soon as possible all
those things I&#39;ve mentioned and I hope
I&#39;ll see all of you at the uh event on
October 25th in Santa Monica uh the
broad theater there and uh there&#39;s still
probably a couple of seats if you&#39;re a
influencer or celebrity VIP you can
contact us
um but the theater unfortunately the the
sales we had to close because it&#39;s
pretty much booked
right
so that&#39;s that&#39;s the breaking news folks
good news these Technologies are real
the Earth can be made new again and
Humanity can go forward uh for thousands
of years without pollution or poverty
and I think within our even my lifetime
and I&#39;m 67 I think there&#39;s a very good
chance we could see the world that was
offered to Colonel Corso when the ET
said a new world if you can take it I I
actually think this is 100 doable if we
all pull together
you know we but we there&#39;s no time to uh
lose
no there&#39;s no time to lose I mean we&#39;ve
run the clock as long as we can yeah
well thank you guys I appreciate it Dr
Greer thanks Pat information you&#39;re
welcome we&#39;ll see you soon okay thank
you bye-bye
