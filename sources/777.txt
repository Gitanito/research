they who already are Philofophers , by read-
ing Greek Books , will be very glad to fee
how Philofopby is handled in Latine.
Cicero might with good reafon anfwer
as he didy becaufe the Excellency of his
Genius', and the great Reputation he had
acquired^ warranted the fuccefs of all he
wrote : But in a deftgn, not 'much unlike
his, I amfar from having thofe grounds
of Confidence which he had. My purpofe
is to difcourfe of Philofopby, but net in a
Philcfopbical manner ; and to raife it to
fuch a pitchy that it (hall not be too dry
and inftpid a Subji U to pleafe Gentlemen ;
nor too mean and trifling to entertain Scbo*
lars. Should I be told, (as Cicero was")
that fuch a Difcourfe as this, would not
pleafe the Learned, becaufe it can teach
them nothing, nor the 1lieterate, becaufe
they willhave no mind to learn J I will
not anfwer as he did, It may be endea-
vouring to pleafe every Body, 1 have pleased
no Body; to keep the middle betwixt two
Extreams is difficult ; and I believe I /ball
never de (ire to put my f
elf

Preface.
Ifthis Book have the luck to be read, 1
declare to thofe who have any knowledge of
natural Philofophy, that 1 do not pretend
to injtrulty but only to divert them, by pre-
fenting to their view in a gay and pleafing
Drefs, that which they already know ; but
they to whom the Subject is new, may be
both diverted andinjlructed: the firjl will
aft contrary to my intention, if they look
for Profit, and the fécond if they Jeek for
nothing but Pleafure.
I have chofen that part of Philofophy
which is mofl like to excite Curioftty \ for
what can more concern us, than to know how
this World which we inhabité, is made ;
and whether there be any other Worlds like
it,
which are alfo inhabited as this
is
.<?
They who have any thoughts to lofe, may
throw them away uponfuch Subject's as this
;
but Ifuppofe they who can (pend their time
better will not
be
at
jo

this Fiction, to render the Book the more

Sex, who without any fuper'natural parts,
or tinclure of Learning, underflands what
isfaid to her ; and without, any confuÇwn,
rightly apprehends what Vortex's and 0-

To penetrate into things either obfeure
in themfelves, or but darkly expreffed, re-
quires deep Meditation, and earnejl appli-
cation of the Mind ; but here, nothing
more is requifite than to read, and to print
an Idea of what is read, in the Fancy,
which will certainly be clear enough. 1
fhall de
fire no more of the fair Ladies ,
than that they will read this Syjleme of

two things, either that we are too (liort

But we fee things quite other wifè than

not fo eafie a matter to be eternal To
have lafted many Ages of Men, one af-
ter another, is no fign of Immortality.
Truly, fays the Qimtefs, I find the Worlds
are far from being able to pretend to
it 5
I will nofr do 'em fo much honour,
as to compare
5
em to the Gardiner that
lived fo much longer than the Rofes :
I begin to think 'em like the Rofes them-
felves, which blow one day, and die the
next : For now I underftand, that if old
Stars difappear, new ones will come in
their room, becaufe every fpecies muft
preferve it felf. No fpecies, Madam,
fed 7, can totally perifti ^
fome perhaps
will tell you, that fuch new Stars are
Suns, which return to our fight again,
after they have been a long time hid
from us, in the profundity of Heaven :
Others may tell you, they are Suns clear-
ed from that thick Cruft, which once
covered them : If I fhould think all this
,poflîbîe, yet I likewife believe that the
Univerfe may be framed in fuch. a man-

World ? I am very much iriclind to be-
lieve fuch new Produftions, becaufe they

continual Revolution ? I am verily per-
fwaded, and are not you fo too, Ma-

or pains can put the fame fecret in pra-
ctice upon the Worlds. I now find, fays
the Cotwtcfs, the Worlds, the Heavens,
and celefrial Bodies fo fubjeft to change,
that I am come to my felf again. To come
the better again to our (elves, Irepl/d, let
