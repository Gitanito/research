  		              		Experience Description   

    On the way to work with my car, around 12:15 pm, in a curve another oncoming vehicle came towards me in my lane. I tried to draw aside and avoid a crash. The only available space was the edge of a wood, because changing lanes could cause other possibilities for a crash with further vehicles, and the more there was a bridge over a river with the possibility to drown in case of a crash. Before we hit, the last thing I remember of the accident was that I had eye contact with the other Female driver. While I was in an artificial sleep (coma?), of which I can't give the exact time, I only knew that something is/was strange.

  What precisely this was I didn't know. I was with my deceased aunt, that she (like all the others being present) had been deceased I didn't know that this point in time and I didn't care. It was simply nice even though I shortly wondered if I could be dead, but this also I didn't care about. I didn't really think about this. I was playing cards with my great-grandma, my aunt and my grandma and then asked for some more coffee. My aunt then said to me: “No, because you now have to go back home. I briefly wondered who had to decide that I would have to go home, as I already moved out from home for a time, but I didn't discuss this and simply accepted it. Probably it was at that moment that I remembered my dogs still being 'at home' and that I didn't know for how long I was 'here' and what would happen to them if I was 'away'. Possibly that was the main reason to 'leave'. And I also didn't 'really leave', I simply woke up in my bed at hospital when I was taken out of the artificial sleep and/or I woke up by myself because my aunt told me that I had to go (I never asked about). My world came crashing down because I was so helpless concerning my 'home' and because on the one hand I was scared to 'slip' back to where I had been before. Because I couldn't exert any influence about 'home' and that I was dependent of those being my medical guardians. And on the other hand, being scared about the 'efforts' I needed to do, to definitely get my own self-responsibility back. This 'fear' was taken away in the first clear moments by a very nice nurse in whose care I found myself in the ICU. He told me that this wouldn't happen and that everything will clear up in my head and will come out ok. There have been times when I would have liked to go back, as over there everything was so simple, and easy and natural.

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Do not know   I was baptized but left church because since a long time already, I have the meaning that one can't  compress the universe into one single category. I believe in the universe, in myself and in evolution. So I call it atheism.  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

What is your religion now?         Do not know   My perception about everything from before this experience was confirmed, underlined and assured.

I knew that it was ok for the moment but couldn't stay this way permanently, I felt right at that point in time in the place I was.  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I now have the biggest value for myself, because only when I'm completely 'satisfied' I can be the good person I want to be.

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I became more 'strict' concerning my borders and I stand up for them even up to break up. My border is my border. I accept the borders of others so they have to accept mine, or they are 'allowed' to leave my life.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I do not know how my remembrance of the experience compares to my remembrance of other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  My memory of the situation/experience is exactly the same than everything what I experienced before and after, but what happened outside of my world I don't know at all because I simply didn't care about. I had enough to do with  'defense' and 'recovering'.  
  
Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I didn't 'know' anything about but I knew by myself that we are infinite and the experience confirmed my knowledge and I started to deal with this.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Uncertain   Through hear say and my own feeling, I had no real information.  

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     Because it 'really' happened to me and I always felt being present at the place.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     Because the new insights show me that I was/am right.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I'm more and more sure in my opinion that we are infinite.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         For me it was good as it was.
