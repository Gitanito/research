DISCOURSE
H E Worthy Galen, in his Book of Forma
tion, &c. asketh, (orbiddeth rather)all the
Philoſophers, That if they have found any
Truth they ſhould communicate it 3 for
nothing was yet known that could ſatisfie, a Learning
Soul. Truth in Science is eaſter talked of than taken.
Many enquireafterTruth,butuſe not theproper Means
toattain it; likeSt. James's Petitioners, Thataskand re
ceive not, becauſe they ask amiſs. And many there are
that pretend topurſue it too, that are onlyObjetis ofits
Diſdain,'unfitforthe Employment, orfor ſo raviſhing and
delightful Acquaintance. Verity is a Lady of Celeſtial
Lineage, andtherefore too Coy for Common or Ordinary
Cºurtſhip. St. Baſil ſurely was in the Right when he ſo
Elegantly wrote, Auššegros i dºščia, & Travraxéºw
#xysºrea. Truth is a Queen that is hard to be taken by
hunting, ſhe muſt be obtained by a Curious and Secret.

the Exquiſite Pen of that Great Ornament of Learning,
the Honourable Mr. Boyle, in his Eſſays, p. go, “When

Aſtrology’s greateft Unbappineſs that it wanteth a Car

Certainty in Science; and I can truly ſay that I beve .

leſtial or Planetary Influences unto each Phyſical body in
the Univerſe, by which they are (as Experience conſtant

andthisis even viſible and manifeſtin inanimate Bodies, as

A Conjunction, is either good or bad, according to the
Nature of the Planets conjoyn'd. If it be of jupiter or
Penus, which are good Planets, it is good. As unition
of Roſes, begetsthe greater Redolence. Et contra.
A Sextile, is an Aſpett of Friendſhip, but imperfectly
ſuch, as being but half a Trine; and is found experimen
tally to enforce the Influences of the good Planets, and
abate the vigor of the Malefiques. -
A Quadrate, is a Ray of imperfett Enmity, being
half the Oppoſition; and irritates the Influences of bad
Planets; and retards the Energy of the good Ones; un
leſs other aſſiſtances appear, which very frequently do.
A Trine, is a moſt perfeót Beam of Happineſs, and
denotes true Concord, JAmity, and Friendſhip. It is a
In
;ſo powerful, that not only thegood Stars diffuſe their
uences moſt forcibly upon Perſonsor things, &c. but
even thebadones diſtil good Atoms thereby: as a Miſer,
by the Tongue of a powerful Orator, is compelled to .
Club towards a general Charity.
An Oppoſition, is the very worſt of Aſhetts, and de:
clares abſolute Enmity and Diſcord, and ſeldom is any
good performed by this Beam, unleſs conſequentially, as
Peace isſaid to be the Effect of War.
Signs Movable, Common, Fixed. º
SomeSigns are obſerved to be Movable, others Com
mon or double bodied, and others Fixed, and they are
thus termed for ſeveral reaſons; fome of which I will
here ſet down. When the Sun or Planets are in Movable
Signs, the Air is ever obſerved to be more apt to Change
and Pary, than in other Signs. When in thoſe called
Common Signs, the Weather is neither very fixed, nor
yet much ſubjećt to Mutation, but partakes of a middle ||
quality between both. When in a fixed Sign, the .

tells you, that Y. governs the firſt 6 Degrees of Y. by
his term, º. hath her term from 6 to 14 g hath his

Note, that a Planets Detriment is always oppoſite to his
Houſe; and his Fall oppoſite to his Exaltation.
And whereas you will find Figures at the Foot of the
Table,under their reſpective Collums, it is to explain the
Number of Dignities they receiveby beingin ſuch parts of
the Heavens, and the Debilities they ſuffer, by being in
Oppoſition to ſome of them.– As a Planet being in his
own Houſe, receives five Dignities; by being in his Ex
altation, four Pignities; by being in his Triplicity, three
º
Dignities; by being in his Term, two Dignities; by be
ing inhis Face, one Dignity. So, by being in his Detri

ſuffers four Debilities. This Table needeth no further,
or other Explanation.

Aftrological Sence; and, of the difference between an
Election, Nativity, and Queſtion. - -
of an Election andits uſe Aſtrologically.
pº by the nice Grammatical conſtruction, and
various uſes of the words, Electio, and 'Exxoyº
With the many curious Definitions, and Derivations,
that the IngeniousCritiques in both Tongues afford us
thereon: It ſhall ſuffice me here to inform you, That
* Eleftion, in an Aſtrological Sence, is the ſerious and
trati Choiſe of a Genuine and Proper time, wherein we
nºy (by God's affiſtance), accordingto the Energy andIn
#nce of ſecondCauſes, begin, or attempt, anymatter or
hintſ of eminent weight and conſideration, proſperouſly
and to good effett. Or, more conciſely, it is the chufing
ºf a good and favourable Poſition of Heaven, and the
huming of a bad one, in our commencement of any
timentor weighty Affair, relatingto humane Life.
Andthis Election, or Choice, may bemadethree man
ºrof ways, according to the Opinions of Aſtrologers,
for the favouring of any undertaking. But, becauſe I
reſolvenot to tranſgreſs my Original intention, which is,
Otto treat of Elections at large, but only of that part
thereof, in this place, which relates to the benefit of the
Worthy and Adventurous Merchant and Sea-man ; (al
thoughfmuſt tell you, that an ingenious Reader may,
by varying what hereads, make this Diſcourſe ſervicea
ble and uſeful unto him, in all manner of Elections what
ºver.) iſhall here propound theſe three ſeveral wº -
. . ~~~ ºf
18 The Aſirological Sea-Mam.
by which an auſpicious Election (ſub Deo) may be made,
and an inauſpicious oneavoided. -
First way of making a. Election.
The firſt (and indeed the chief) way, of making or
framingan Eleftion, is, from the Geneſis or Nativity of
the Perſon or thing, for whom it is deſigned tobe ſewicea
ble, in caſe that can be but truly knownand obtained.
And this is the beſt and moſt rational way of making or
framing an Election, and ſo approved of by the beſt and
learned of Aftrological Writers; becauſe here is a ſe
cure ground or foundation for the Artiſt to build on :
It being a moſt certain, ſplendid, and ruled truth – That
all Progreſſes and Ends of Things, are Analogous or ſuita
ble to their beginnings. And there can be no beginning ſo:
abſolute and ; and, in all reſpects, ſo fit tobe re.
ly'd on, intheſe matters, as a Radix or Nativity truly
known and proved. - *
To illuſtrate this way of makingan Election, it is cond
venient, that I deſcend to a practical Inſtance. *:
Know then, that if thou wouldeſt Elect atime favou-º
rable from the Nativity or Birth of anything, for thy:
purpoſe, thou muſt then make the Figure of Heaven,
or thy Election, agreeable thereunto, by framing it in
Sextile or Triue unto that; or by making the places ol
the Fortunate Stars, viz. Y. S. G). or D. or their Trint
and Sextile places therein, the Aſcendant or Mid-Hea.
ven, or the Sun, or Moons, or Part of Fortune's places.
in thy Election, ever being careful to avoid the places di
Saturn, Mars, or the Dragons Tail inthe Radix, or their
Oppoſite or Quadrantal places, as dangerous for either:
your Horoſcope, Medium Cali, Sun, or Moon, &c in
your Election, and then leave the Iſſue to providence.
And, here by the way, let not the ingenious Reader
miſtake me, or think that I aſſert a Reminiſcency in the
Stars, as in Animate or Reaſonable Creatures; or that
The Aſtrological Sea-eMām. 19

either perfum'd or of an ill ſcent, as hi º:ºº:
a lateLearned Author is pleaſed, in ...” “*
the room of better matter, to caſt - -
ſcoffingly upon Aſtrologers. I only aſſert à Harmony
and Similitude in the Sphears of Heaven, and in the Mo
tions of the Planets; together with an Energy by their
Motion, to ſtimulate Influences, kind, or unkind, in re
ſpect of us poor Mortals. And although the Starsſhould
haveno knowledge of the places they were in at a Nati
vity, that they ſhould be preſumed to remember what
theydid there, or what Influences they irritated and emit
tedthe laſt time they paſſed their Radical places; yet,
tertainly, the God of Stars knew well enough, that
hehad Created them, and appointed them alſo, to ačt and
do his pleaſure (aswe muſt acknowledge they are always
Frforming) when they come there: And that is by aſ
firingus, they have in themſelves a known and unaltera
beinfluence in one and theſame part of Heaven always;
and this as certain asin a Clocks ſtriking, when the hours
it directs to, are accompliſhed.
Thus the Sun when he comes to riſe Coſmically with
the Stars of the Eagle, always pro- •
ducethRainand Winds. So alſo, with Tranſis very Powdful
Wirgilie, or Seven Stars. And, the in tvºry rºſti.
likealſo, when he comes to their op- -
poſite places. After this manner, when he riſeth with
the Dog-Star (although ſome think that Camis non Aſordet
#Anglia) have we a hot and parching Air, and an in
kmperate Seaſon. Cum multis aliis, &c. And, thus al
| F. or 3. paſſing the Aſcendant Gº, or X. in any
besNativity, (chiefly, if they oppreſſed them, or any
f them in the Radix thereof) irritates Choller, or in
Feaſeth Melancholly; whereas, A. G. and Y. paſſing
He ſame places, exite a Generous, Pleaſant, Free and
heerful humour. And of the truth hereof, can I pro
ce abundant retive, ºf any Man, that º:
- a 2. lit

but his Nativity by him, may eaſily prove the truth
hereof in himſelf, and that frequently. -
Let but the Antagoniſt be ſo ingenious as to obſerve a
little theſe matters, and then Character me for an Impo
ſtor, and a broacher of Fables to delude the World with,
in the room of Truth to inform it, if he do not find theſe
things true. But to our Election again.
I ſhall give an Examplein the Nativity of a Ship, and
anElection from it to confirm the Method or Rule fore
going.
A SHIP firſt Launched
after Her being Built.
I.an Ağrological fence, the firſt Launching of a Ship;
A to try its ability in the Water, in which Element itis
to live, and ſhew its Force and Aćtivity, and to under
its Fortune, is its true Nativity, Radix, or Birth:
hour, &c. Howbeit
>
The Aſirological Sea-Mam. 21
Howbeit, although its General Fate, be written in the
particular Poſition of Heaven; yet, we find that is apt
tobeeither augmented or diminiſhed, by a careful heed
ing, or a non-obſervance, of ſuch Times, wherein it is to
be Re-launched, or, when it ſhall weigh Anchor, in or
| derto ſome particular Service or Aćtion for the future.
! Now, we know a Ship can be Launched but once, in re
gard of its Nativity, and in relation to its General Fate:
but, itmay be Re-launched forty times, in reſpect of its
Particular Fate; which is terminated in every .
;Aétion, for which ſhe happensto be thus particularly
tted. - -
. Therefore, to Elect a time favourable for this Ship to
begin any Eminent Aétion, from its Nativity, is to ob.
ſerve the ſame, and the places of the good Planets there
in; (as before you were taught) and let the Figure of
theElection, as near as you can, be under either £. Y.
II. H. Horoſcopical; they being the Trine and Sextile
places of the Figure. Or elſe, let it be the ſame with
theNativity it ſelf. But, if neitherof theſe can be ob
tained, (as ſometimes it may ſo fall out) then take the
places of the Fortunate Stars, or of the Siem or Moon, for
the Horoſcope; ever obſerving, to poſitethe Moon well,
and in ºf Configuration with the principal Significa
tors; which always are, the Lords of the Aſcendant and
Ninth Houſes, and the diſpoſiters of the Moon and Part
ºf Fortune. Now, in this Nativity foregoing, A. Y.
| 0 ) are in × Y. & take therefore thoſe Signs, or
the Signs of their Triangles, for the Horoſcope, or Moons
place, and (favenie Dio) your Election will be ſucceſs
ful and happy. But you muſt always have a care of
that part of c. which h's J. or 3. his é. hurts,
leaſt thereby you deſtroy thehopes of a good Elélion.

The ſecond may of making an Elečijon.
2. TheSecond way of making or framing an Election,
or finding out a Friendly time forthe Launching or ſetting
Sail of a Ship, is from an Horary Question, (of the Ma
ſter or Captain thereof, or of any other Perſon eminent
ly concerned therein) ſeriouſly, and, intento animo pro
pounded. (i. e.) when his or their minds ſhall be ear
neſtly ſolicitous and thoughtful about either the ſafety or
hazzard of a Weſſel, or, of their own profit or loſs ari
For, the mind in theſe matters is
principally buſied or affected, as it firſt of all is informed
either withhope or fear of the matter in queſtion, by the
Pulſe of the Primum Mobile, or Soul of the World;
(Call it whether of thetwo you pleaſe) and thence comes
itto paſs, that our hopes and fears, are, not only imper
manent, but very ſuddenly tranſent, and ſlide from one
thing to another in moments; even as the univerſal Spi
lit of the World moveseither with, or againſt our parti
cular Spirits; advancing toour Expectancy's, or contra
* ...;our deſires, according to the Nature and Diſpoſi
tion of the AMºndane Figure, at that time when ſuchfears
ordeſires are prevalent. -
And this is the true reaſon and ground of an Horary
Queſtion; and plainly demonſtrable from the Coeleſtial
* Mathematicks, even in all the Aétions and Paſſions of
every perfon in this inferiour world.
Neither can any Man (let him ſuppoſe himſelf a Socra.

threatned to the Querent; Contradićtory weather, and
a fear of Pyrates, &c. to be brief, the Teſtimonies of
ill were ſo many, and ſo little of good in the Figure to
ballance them, (nay none at all, but the Poſition of Y .
on the 7th. Angle in A. of D. who happily transferred
the Light of g. toher.) That I poſitively adviſed the
Querent to a pretermitting of thatintended undertaking,
acquainting him with the ſeveral AMenaces of the Hea
vens towards him ; bidding himbe careful how hetemp- -
ted Providence, left it proved worſe than I feared, which
indeed wasbad enough. . . . - - \
But, notwithſtanding the unhappy Menaces of the Fi
gure, and my Advice given, he tells me, he is engagd
with, and to, ſeveral Owners, who have agreed with
him upon the Voyage; and it is not now in his power to
avoid the undertaking thereof, without great diſparage
ment unto him, together with the ill opinion of his
Owners and Friends. Yet confeſſeth he is ſuſpicious of
the improſperouſneſs of the Voyage; (as indeed, who
is not, that hath Mars in the Aſcendant of ſuch an En
quiry?) and therefore propoundshethe Queſtion. \
What is now to be done? 'Tis dangerous to go: yet
go he muſt. No hopes, neither of embettering theſe
rugged and ſevere Menaces by an auſpicious Election, as
can begº. from the Queſtion; unleſs the Moon in

Itherefore (ſyth there is no remedy for the Querent, but S

therein, the unhappy threats it intimates. * , -

All which Arguments (if nothing, were to be minded
but this Eleftion) pronounce it to be a moſt happy and
Heaven-favouring Eleštion of Time in earneſt, for ſuch
a purpoſe: and declares theVoyage, not only to be happy,
and profitable, but Eminently Reputable alſo. Asindeed,
with reſpect had to the Original hereof, which was the
Figure of the Queſtion, it was. But, we muſtalways
conſider, that God and Nature do nothing in vain; for,
had not this Querent been irritated to an Interrogation,
this auſpicious Elećtion could never have been liable to an
abatement of its good ſignifications: but, as it hatha de
pendance upon that for its Radix, we cannot expect it
ſhould have the full Effects of ſo many IlluſtriousSignifi
cations. For we muſt know, and ſhall ever be ſure to
find ittrue, That an Election (be it never ſo good or bad
in it ſelf) can never totaly alter the Promiſesor Aſenaces of
an Original Queſtion, which is its Nativity, but only
augment to the Good, or mitigate the Evil of them. For
therein are the Seeds of the fift or Misfortune of
ſuch Voyage or Veſſel incloſed; as Fruit is originally in
its Root; or as Scent and Colours of Wegitables are ver
ally in their Seeds. " - - Nor
The Aſtrological Sea-Mam. 29
Nor need any trouble themſelveswith obječting, that,
not a Question, but a Nativity, is the Radix properly of
an Election. Sith the Queſtion, if with a ſeriousand ſo
licitous mind propounded, is ever the ſame, (or very
like unto it) in ſignification with the Radix; and may
therefore be reaſonably preſumed equal with the proper
Root thereof; eſpecially when the true Nativity is not
known, or not by any means to be found. As a Step
Father, in the room of the natural Sire, performing all
the Offices of a Father, is, by a Child to be looked upon
and owned in the ſame Capacity, and Relation to him,
as was his real Father, when alive. And if experience
will ſerve to vouch this verity further, (if there be at
leaſt any need thereof) I can produce ſufficient.— But
to the Effect.
The Ship did weigh Anchor at the time Elected; and
withinſix days did receiveDammage by a Storm,wherein
it had like to have been Wrecked. In twenty days af
ter, it had neerly been caſt away again, by running into
the Quickſands; but, with greater danger than loſs, in
little time got very well off again.
Afterwards, this Weſſel made its Port both proſper
ouſly and ſpeedily; ſo alſo, it did make a happy return
homeagain, and this without any material or remarkable
prejudiceor dammage;excepting that they werediſtreſſed
ſomewhat intheir return, for Proviſion, and freſh water,
ſome of theirs proving ill; by reaſon whereof, (as might
be reaſonably ſupposd) both the Maſter and Marriners
were a little unhealthful.– There happen'd alſo a ſmall
| Mutiny in the Ship, (like 3 in the Horoſcope of the Que
ſtion) occaſion'd by an unlucky impudent fellow, a Car
penter belonging to the Ship; this was ſtill as they were
returning home,
To conclude, the profit of the Voyage was much leſs
than waseither expected, or at firſt propounded by the
Owners; or, (as I have heard the Maſter of the Veſki
ſay) than was ever known before.

Thushave you abrief, but true Hiſtory of the whole
matter. And, in every reſpect, moſt ſuitable to the ſig
nifications of the bad portended in the Scheam of the
Question, and likewiſe of the ſafety denoted by the Fi
gure of the Election. ! .
By which we may obſerve, That anill Queſtion may
be bettered by a fortunate Election of Time. And,
that a good Eleãion is really ſerviceable and profitable.
But then, we may alſo obſerve, That tho' the Election
be never ſo good in itſelf, its auſpicious ſignifications can
not totally avert the unhappy Menaces of that Figure,
or Radix, from whence you make or frame the Election.
And, ſo you have the ſecond way of framing an Electi.
on explained. |
*
The Third way of making an Elim,
The Thirdwayof making an Eleſtion, Aftrologically,
is, when ueither the Nativity of the Ship or Weſſel is
known, nor yetan Horary Qaeſtion propounded concer
ning it. And, thus I can aſſure you, it often falls out.
For there is ſcarce one Man of ten, that knows his time
of Birth; and, I preſume, there is ſcarce one Ship of
an hundred, whoſe Geneſis, or time of firſt Launching,
was ever taken notice of. Thegreaterpartof the World
either thinking to over-look all Starry Influences, or elſe
are readily willing to neglect them; as believing ſuch
knowledge, (though both excellent and veritable in it
ſelf ) to be only the Apocriphal part of Philoſophy, and
therefore in no wiſe fit to be minded by any that Hunger
and Thirſt after true Wiſdom. º
& But this obiter.- If the Birth-hour benot known
nor yet a Queſtion concerning your matter propounded,
the Artiſt muſt then endeavour to find a Poſition of Hea
ven, wherein the Aſoon, and Lord of the Horoſcope, &c.
ſhall be in good and fortunate places of the Figure, and ſº
in Signs Superiour and Commanding, free from afflićtion.
and impediment of any kind. - I

I would not, now, here, have any over Curious or
Critital Perſon (and yet I know Aſtrology hath its Here
liques, as well as Divinity) from Opinion and Humour
only, objećt to me.— That Elections are not to be made,
but from ſome known Radix. For, if by an nnknown
Radix(which isthe reverſe of theknown) they mean the
Nativity of a Perſon or Weſſel not to be found, or of a
Queſtion unpropounded, &c. Then to ſome perſons,
Weſſels, &c. the Heavens muſtas to humane Science be
wholly uſeleſs; becauſe it is impoſſible to Derive, or
Elect, from that which is not, or is not, at leaſt toour
knowledge. But this were a groſs abſurdity, as well as
a great untruth to ſuppoſe, Syth the Aoy& anteuxliiis,
or ºtherial matter, isin every placeconſtantly operating
to ſome particular end. And, although the Lines by
which this ſubtile Influence is directed, ſerve not me, or
is not forcible enough to moveme, to doubt, it may, be
yet ſtrong enough to direct me to Aét; and, ſo I ma
happily make choiſeof a good timetocommence my Af
fairsin, although I know not theNativities of the Perſons
or things, which are Inſtruments or Mediums by which
my purpoſed Affairsarebrought to paſs. . For, God and
Nature, as they are never idle, ſo they do nothing, but
toſome ſignaleffect or purpoſe.
Heaven hath its various Seaſons in it ſelf, as well as
tous: and Beginnings, whether to Men known or un
known, have proportionate progreſſesand ends. And,
(if Seneca may be believed) it is not in humane power to
contradićt an Original Deſtinated Intention: ſo, that if
thy Election be good, thou needeſt notdoubt, butthe Ra
dix belouging tothe Weſſel thou frameſt thy Election for,
isgood alſo.
If therefore by an unknown Radix, they mean a time
involved in the general Rowl of the Heavens, which are
the firſt movers, augmentorsand decayers of all things;
we muſtfreely acknowledge that ſuch Time, by reaſon
of aninfinite Coeleſtial variety, is too hard for Mortality
- - to
i
32 The Aſtrological Sea-Mam.
todiſcover, withouttheadvantage of DivineInſpiration.
Yet is this no injury to our way of Elettion, but rather
ſeems to conclude our §: For, it is in this fence
that I aſſert Elections, profitableand truly tobe made and
known, tho' the Nativity be Ignote, or that there bene
ver any Queſtion propounded: Sith the Election is ever
the Image of the Radix; and what is Ignote to us, is
not ſo in it ſelf, but hath a place in the Univerſal Regi
fter of Nature. And all things derive from the Heavens.
But yet, if any ſhallfurther objećt, that, ſhould we
allow of ſuchkind of Elections, they are as probable to
prove Bad as Good. . As Morine and ſome others, among
us, very idly from him haveſuggeſted; urging that the
Eighth or Twelve Houſes, &c. as well as the Eleventh,
Fifth,or Tenth, &c. of a Radix, mayaſcend theEaſtern
Finitor in an Election. Or, that the places ofSaturn and
Mars, or their Oppoſitions or Qgadrantal places, mayº
in a Figure of Election, happen to be Horoſcopical, as
well as the places of jupiter or Venus, or their Sextile,
or Trigonal Beams: And ſo come to render that Pernitious
and Deſtructive, which our Election pronounceth good,
happy, and hopeful. And, on the contrary, may de--
notethat to be Fortunate and Succeſsful, which we may
not only fear, but find to be attended with abſolute Ruine .
and Deſtrućtion. To this I anſwer. - º
If thething were poſſible which is urged by this Ob
jećtion, the Inference, would indeed, prove too ſtrong
tobe ſhaken or invalidated by any Man. But it is not
poſſible that there can beany Contradićtion to the Ope
rations of Nature, where a Mans Will is at liberty, and .
only to be Exerciſed, as himſelf pleaſeth, as it is in the
framing of an Election of Time, when a Radix is whol.
ly unknown. - -
...Beſides, Nature would be found guilty of offering
Violenceto its own Decrees, if it ſhould deſtroy its ge: ;
neralintentionfor theſake, or advantage of any onepar
ticular, asin this Caſe. As is theRiver, ſo isthe Stream,

foreither Goodneſ; or Badneſs. And if the Tree be good,
theFruit thence iſſuing cannot be improſperous. Know
therefore, that if thy Radix be kind; (let it be known
or unknown) thy Election cannot be cruel. Can any
one accuſe Nature for want of skill in Geometry? if
not, why may we not (by God's Bleſfing) thereby, be
directed to a favourable Election, although we do not
know our Radixor Nativity? - -
But, methinks, the matter is moſt plain, and put be
yond all doubt, in the verity of Horary Queſtions, (of
which we mention'd ſomewhat before.) Inaſmuch, that
either the ſame Horoſcope, with thatof the Nativity, or
a Sign of the ſame Trigon, (which is ever ſemblable unto
i) hath ever been found to poſſeſs the Eaſt Angle at the
time of the ſerious propounding any Horary §.
Ald this I have more than an hundred times proved true;
byanafter knowledge of the true Geneſis or Nativity of
ſindry Querents. -
A Conſpicuous Truth thereofit is, that the Heavens,
inreſpect of the ſame Subjećt, move to the ſame effect,
by a ſimilitude of Figure. And conſequently, an Electi
i.may be profitably made, although the Radix be not
[10Wn. -
Some, may alſo yet further objećt. If neither a Ra
dixbe known, or a Queſtion ſeriouſly propounded by a
Qurrent concern'd, and it be true that the Progreſſes and
Eidsof Things anſwer to their Beginnings; what need
thenhave we to make Elections 2 – 1 Anſwer,--
... Although the Radix be unknown, and the Perſoncon
(trued cannot be ſerious or ſolicitous enough in his mind

Iſaynot ſo much unto ſuch a Perſon, as to one more fe
Houſly and Philoſophically affected with the Matter or

that Nature hath a particular deſign inall her Operations,
which is certainly not only a happineſs but a benefit t

favour us; and Time in general, which may be either

3. And laſtly, an Election declares the Fatum Navijº
the ſucceſs of the Ship or Veſſel, &c. which cannot but
bea ſatisfaction (at leaſt) unto ſuch Men that are themo
indifferent in theſe Matters. I ſay, it cannot but beaſ:
tisfaction unto them, to know this, although they can
not command their Minds or Tongues to an enquiry afte/
it. The Knowledge and Obſervance of an Election, (bé
the Radix known or unknown) muſt therefore be effectu
al and advantageous.
But, leaving theſe, perhaps too curious diſquiſitions,
as not very proper, or uſeful to my honeſt and well
meaning Sea-AMan, or for our vulgar Engliſh Readers;
for thoſe I foreſee will be the cheif Inſpectors of this diſ.
courſe. (And indeed I do not Calculate it for the Meri

is but time to) come to an Example, the better to Illu-º

Now, I am ſo far from fiding with one of theſe Learned
Authors againſt the other, that I know no reaſon but I
may embrace both their Opinions as to this matter. Nei
ther do they thwart, but ſtrengthen each other, and the
Truth alſo. For, the firſt Opinion, makes a Diviſion in
regard of the Signs of the Zodiack; the ſécond, in re
ſpect of the Houſes of Heaven. Nor isthe one perfect,or
fit to be relied on, without the aſſiſtance of the other.
For the Houſes have their perfect and unalterable ſignifi

the parts of the Zodiack. And, when AMorinus preten

Science, but to all the Sons of Art. Yet) he had been
more ingenious, I muſt needs ſay, and more Eminently
to have been extolled, had he related what others had
hinted at (in that matter, although not allout ſo happily)
before him. Nor do I find, that, that Great Philoſopher
and Phyſician hath made any remarkable Diſcoveries in,
or Additions to Aſtrology, beyond what the Ingenious
Cardan, and (before him) Ptolemy, and fundry Greek.
and Arabian Authors had done. 6. he hath had the
happineſs tolive in an Age, wherein the Latine Tongue,
and perhaps Logique and 'Philjºy too, have been more
Eminently encouraged, and made uſe of, than in ſome of
ºtheir more Cloudy Days; and ſo he hath been enabled to
ſpeak the ſame things as they did, in more Curious,
* Apt and Quaint terms. I wiſh he had not let ſlip, (not

of the proper Significators of a Ship or Veſſel, as wellin
an Election, as Queſtion, &c.
QOme. Aftrologers are of Opinion, that the Aſcendant
S ſhall in all reſpects, ſignifie a Ship or Weſſel, be it
either in Queſtion, Nativity or Election. Others urge,
that the Moon and Aſcendant generally are Significators
of the State of the whole Ship and its ſoyage. So Haly.
Theſe are his words— Luna & Aſcendins generaliter.
ſunt ſignificatores totius Navis, & ſuorum ſtatuum, &c.
(i. e.) The Aſcendant and the Moon are generally the
ſignificators of the whole Ship, and of its ſucceſs, and .
the Lord of the Aſcendant ſhall ſignifie the Perſons Sail
ing therein. — Bomatus tells us, that we ought prin
cipally to have regard to the Moon. For, faith he, –
Ipſa habet participationem & ſignificationem in omni Prin
cipio, in omni Itinere, in omni Loco, in omni Tempore, in
omni Re, atq; in omni Hora, (i.e.) The Moon hath par
ticipation and ſignification in every Beginning, in every

Journey, in every Place, in every Time, in ever
Thing, and in every Hour. So great isthe Influence of
the Moon, ſhe being the Conveyer of all the other Pla
'nets Influxes tous, that ſhe is, by us, to beexcluded no
thing, that hath relation to Humane Buſineſs or Aétion.
And it is no way to be doubted, but that the Aſcendant
and the Moon both, have a very great power and ſigni
fication of the good or bad ſucceſs that attends not only
Ships, &c. but all things under the Sun; as they ſhall
happen to be either afflićted or aſſiſted in your Figure.
But, of this more anon, when I come to the Third
Settion.
But then, by the leave of the Learned Haly, &c. I
muſt tell you, that it isthus to be underſtood only in
Elections, or in the Radix, or timeof thefirſt Launching
of a Ship. For in Queſtions concerning Veſſels or
|Iſoyages, &c. Not the Aſcendant, but ſeventh Houſe
ſhall poſitively ſignifie the Veſſel; That being the Grand
Angle of Matters or Buſineſs queſted, as caſting an op
poſite Rayto the Horoſcope, which ever muſtſignifie the
Perſon Enquiring, or thing begun, &c. unleſs (to con
tradićt thereaſon hereof) we ſhould ſuppoſethe Ship of
a capacity to ſpeak, and ſo able to propound its own
Queſtion; Then indeed, the Aſcendant were proper
to ſignifie the Veſſel. But ſince all things inanimate, as
wanting the Organs of Speech, cannot therefore be
thought to deſire, much leſs to diſcourſe their Neceſſi
ties; we will therefore reſt ſatisfy'd, that there is anab
ſolute inability in them,either to Enquire,or Require,6-c.
Therefore the Aſcendant in matters of Queſtions, ſhall
only ſignifie the Perſon Enquiring; and the ſeventh An
gle ſhall ever repreſent the Ship or Veſſel enquired after.
And, this is the difference between a Qgeſtion, and a
Radix or Election, in an Aſtrological ſence. In the
Queſtion, there isaPerſon Interrogating, which the Af.
cendant (you have heard for what reaſon)muſt ever ſig
nifie. In a Radix or Elettion,there isno Perſon Enquiring,
an V
42. The Aſirological Sea-Man.
any more than in the Figure of the Birth of a Man or
Woman: and therefore the Aſcendant therein (withour
Learned Arabian) ſhall repreſent the Veſſel or Ship.
That being the primeAngle, (orPoint rather) upon, or
toward whichthe Coeleſtial Atoms make their Impreſſion
principally, to be diſtinguiſhed in time, by Effects of
Good or Bad Fortune, upon the Perſon or Thing born or
begun underit; as is tobe known by obſervingthe true :
puntium temporis thereof. The Aſtrologer therefore, muſt .
vary his Rules or Aphoriſmsin matters of Questions, from
thoſeof Eleftions and Radixes, by remembring (as he is +.
here taught)ever to take the ſeventh Angle in the place,
or ſtead of the Horoſcope; and the Lord of the ſeventh, ".
inthe room of the Lord of the Aſcendant, and therewith
conſider, and apply thereto, the AMoons Configurations, :
together with her Applications and Separations, &c. and ºl.
you ſhall rarely fail (except through inadvertency) in 3
your Judgments. Further proof hereof, ſhall produce in
its proper place. {}

a Ship or Veſſel; and how they are to be varied in rela

Latitude of the place it ispropounded under; and then,
either mentally, or otherwiſe, he muſt ſum up all the
Arguments of Happineſs and Misfortune he ſhall find
therein; and, accordingto the Major, or great number
of Teſtimonies, let him give his Judgment, either of
ºcceſs or prejudice. And toaſſiſt him the better here
in, let him well ponder the ſence and meaning of the
following Rules. -
1. When in your Figure youfind the Principal Signifi
cators of a Ship or Weſſel, (you were acquainted which
they were before) and of the Men ſailing therein, to be
ſtrong and well poſited, and every way freefrom Affli
étion, you may then Judge ſafety and ſucceſs to the
Ship, and tothe A4ariners alſo.
3. If the Aſcendant of the Figure ſhallbefortunate,
and the Lord of the Aſcendant Unfortunate, and in ab
jećt places of the Heavens; Yº may then Judge that
the Ship or Weſſel ſhall do well, and arrive happily to its
intended Port, or Haven; but that there will happen
Dammage and Misfortune to the Men ſailing therein.
3. And, if youfind in the Figure, the Moon, and the
Fortunate Stars Angular, and well affected, and the In
fortunes Cadent, and otherwiſe dejećted and oppreſſed;
you may then conclude, that the Ship andher Lading will
go very ſafe to her Harbour, or intended Port; and this
without any interruption. So happy is it, when you
find the Arguments of Miſchief under Hatches,and thoſe
of good ſucceſs, exalted.
4. If at any time you chance to find in your Figure,
the Argumentsof ñº, and the Teſtimonies of danger .
tobe equal; and that your Significations of ſafety hap to
bederived fromthe more Noble parts of the Figure,then
ſhall the Veſel in queſtion be wholly freed from the dan
gers menaced, although it fortune to be neverſo ſeverely
and ſmartly beſieged or encountered by them.
5. When you find that the principal ſignificators of
the Ship or Wiffel are ſwift in motion, and happilyintº

flall then make both a ſpeedy and ſucceſsful Voyage.
Such an one, asſhallbeprofitable to the Owners, and re
putable to the Maſter thereof, &c. and this ſhall be the
more Eminent and Conſiderable, if together herewith,

6. Royal Fixed Stars upon the Angles of the Figure, at.
the time when any Ship or Veſſel is firſt Launched; or at:
the beginning of a Voyage,orits firſtYº...--
always denotes ſuch Ship or Voyage to be more than or
dinary famous for, and in Aćtion and Buſineſs; and to
be capable of doing and enterprizing ſomething, beyond
...what other Ships docommonly promiſe, or areknown to
perform. l
7. In Sea-Voyages, or in matters of Maritime con:
cern, it is moſt natural and proper for Signs of the Wał
try Trigon toaſcend the Horoſcope; (chiefly Cancer: that
being, not only the Manſion-houſe of the Moon, but the
Exaltation of jupiter, as by the foregoing Syſtem is
taught.) And if the Moon be above the Earth, in good
Aſpect, viz. Sextile or Trine thereunto, and free from
all Oppreſſions of the Unfortunate Stars; there is then no
fear or doubt, but happineſs will attend ſuch Voyage. .
8. When the Degrees of the Horoſcope, Aſid-Heaven,
Sun and Moon, the Lord of the Horoſcope and Diſpoſiter
of the Moon, are found to be ſuch, as Aſtrologers term,
Light, Maſculine, and Encreaſing Fortune, (for there
are ſuch particular affections to parts of the Signs, as
well as to the whole Sign, as I ſhall elſewhere prove.)
A Ship then ſetting ſail, weighing Anchor, or being then
Launched, will (in its Life, or Voyage) meet with ſplen
did Honourand Succeſs, other Arguments of good For
tune herewith concurring.

your Figure, (if other Teſtimonies but moderately :

for ſervice and ſailing. -
10. The Sun, Moon, jupiter, Venus, &c. in your
Aſcendant, or Mid-Heaven, or, the Lord of the Aſcen
dant in the Tenth, or Lord of the Tenth in the Aſcendant
ever declares Fortunate Weſſels at their firſt Launching;
and, if it thus º at the beginning of Sea-Voyages,
irportends not only good ſucceſs to the Ship or Veſſel, &c.
but Preſages great Honour to the Commander thereof,
and advantage to the Labourious and Induſtrious Mari
nërS.
11. Many Fortunate Stars in the Eleventh Houſe, well
beholding the Part of Fortune, the ſecond Houſe or their
Lords, always declares the Ship or Veſſel to be ſuccesful
in Merchandizing, and that the Owners of ſuch Ship ſhall
grow Rich apace by her. Such Poſitions in a Man of
War, ſhews her Wićtorious, and to be Maſter of many
Prizes, and over many Enemies.
12. The Moon in Sextile, Quadrate, or Trine of the
'Sun, jupiter or Wenus, increaſing in Light and Motion,
denotes admirable ſailers; and makes alſo, very auſpi
cious and ſpeedy Voyages. And, if ſhe happen not to
be in her Detriment, or, in via Combuffa; but on the
contrary, freefrom all manner of Afflićtion, and Poſited
in a good part of Heaven, the ſucceſs and ſwiftneſs
thereof, will be the more remarkable. -
13. The Moon with Mercury in the ſecond Houſe, or
lingood Aſpect unto it, or tothe Lord thereof; or, their
being in Conjunction in the Tenth Houſe, in amicable Po
ſition of the ſecond, or of his Lord, declares Fortunate
and Proſperous Voyages; and likewiſe portends ſuch Weſ.
ſºlº to be thriving and ſucceſsful, that are ſo Launched.

Shering the ſeveral Arguments of Danger, which Aſtro
logically attend any Ship or Veſſel from the time of its
firſt Launching, Weighing Anchor, &c.
Hº acquainted you with the ſeveral Ar
guments of good ſucceſs, that impends over Veſ:
fels, at the time of their firſt Launching, &c. (and I,
need not Apologize that I began with them, ſince happi
nels ought to have the precedency of Misfortune, at
leaſt in the eſteem of Men, let them be never ſo ſeverel
in the Study and Fraćtice of Philoſophy; Goodbeingever
preferrible to Evil.) I come now to preſent you with
The Aſirological Sea-Mum. 47
the moſt Eminent Teſtimonies of Danger that naturally
attends ſuch Eminent A&tions; hoping thereby to aſſiſt
Mankind how to prevent many of the Misfortunes the
are conſtantly ſubject unto, by a non-obſervance of
the Principiums of ſuch great Affairs. And beginning
with the 55 Aphoriſm of Ptolemy's Centiloquium for
the Eaſe and Benefit of the Artiſts Memory, I ſhall
give you them Aphoriſtically, as I did theother.
1. The Malignant Influence of Mars againſt Ships is
diminiſhed, when he is placed neither in the Mid-Heaven,
orEleventh Angle ; In thoſe places if he be poſited, the
Weſſel will bedeſtroy'd by Pirates: But if the Horoſcope
be afflićted by any Martial Fixed Stars, the Ship will
then be burned. - - - - -
2. When you find the ſignificators of a Ship or Weſſel,
weak and infortunated of the Malefiques, (for there is a
great difference between aNegative and a Poſitiveweak
fineſs of a Planet) and in ill places of the Heavensalſo;
much dangerthen attends,not only the Weſſelor Shipthat is
then Launched, or ſo ſetting fail,or weighing Anchor, &c.
butof all things orperſons in her, or belonging to her;
if not a total or abſolute loſs of both them and her too.
3. If in your Figure you find, a Malevolent Planet ha
wing Dignities in the Eighth Houſe, to be poſited in the
Aſcendant; or, that the Lord of the Aſcendant ſhall be
| poſited in the Eighth ; or in evil Aſpect of the Lord of
the Eighth, Twelfth, Sixth, or Fourth Houſes; all theſe
declare the Loſs or Ruine of the P'ºffel, and of all things
| inher, or atleaſt a very great hazzard thereof. Nor can
ſuch Shipbe ſucceſsful either to Commander or Sea-men.
4. When in the Figure you find the Moon to be under
theSuns Beams, applying to Combuſtion, or in that part
!of Heaven called the Combuff-way; or otherwiſe afflićted
under the Earth, you may then be bold to pronounce
lº.Danger and Misfortune, to attend ſuch Ship or Weſ.
ſel, that is ſo Launched, or that under ſuch a poſition ei
|ther weigheth Anchor, or ſets fail. -
5. If
48 The Aſtrological Sea-Man.
5. If at any time you happen to find the Aſsendant
and Moon unfortunate in the Figure, aud the Lord of the
Aſcendant to beſtrongand well poſited; The Ship is then
likely to be in a bad condition, and to encounter many
misfortunes; but her Lading, and the Men in her, will||
do well, and come off without much prejudice. |
6. When the Infortunes ſhall be in Angles or ſuccedent
parts of the Figure, and the Fortunes happen to be Ca
aent, &c. the Veſſel that is then Launched, will be ſub
jećt to many Eminent misfortunes; or, the Ship that is:
then weighing Anchor for a Voyage, will receive veryº
ſignal and remarkable prejudice therein. And (let the
induſtrious Artiſt be but careful to obſerve it;
and heſhall find) the misfortune will happen upon that
part of the Veſſel, ſignified by the Sign where the Infor.
tune is poſited. -
7. If the Infortune threatning Danger, be Saturn; In
a Radix, or the Launching of a Ship, he menaceth it
witha troubleſome, but a #.Life, and that it ſhall be
ſplit or ſunk, before it have done or performed any Emil
nent or Conſiderable Service. In a Veſſel ſetting ſail for
a Voyage, he declares it to be improſperous, and in great
danger of ſinking, running into Sands, or ſplitting, &c.
and that the Men ſhall either be drowned, or elſe ſubjećt.
to very much ſorrow and hardſhip: unleſstheir own par
ticular Fates are contradićtory to the general Fate of the
Ship; then (indeed) they may eſcape with the leſs haz
zard or miſchief. - !.
8. But when the Infortune threatning danger, ſhallbe
Mars, and he in any of his Eſſential Dignities, or aſpe
ºplace where he hath power, or elſe poſited in an
Earthly Sign, he then portends the ſame prejudices that
Saturn did, but with much greater violence: and, before.
the Cataſtrophe of the Peſſel, he declares many remarka
ble and various troubles to happen unto it.:

Having in my Ephemeris for 1670. Printed this Emi

thatI therein ſaid of thisNoble veſſel, , , , , ...,’
. ThisGallant Shipwasfirſt Launched at the time with

of the Stars, for its Actionand Duration in the World.
The Nativity of it was inauſpicious, as you may ſee by
that reciprocal Argument of Miſcheif, ſo Fatalin all Coe

them directly. (1.) In her being Cadent froman Angle.
(2.) Asinthe Terms of the Infortunes; to which Imay
! add, ſheis withViolentandTempeſtuousStars. (3.) By

The ſame Author.tellsus inanºther place, Thatinan
Election (or Nativityof this kind) we ought notby any
means, to place either of theInfortunes in the Aſcendant,
or inany of the Angles. Theſearehis words. --— Ne
ſint Infortunia in Aſcendente, nec in aliquo Angulorum.
But herein we find his advice directly oppoſed: for both
the Infortunes are in Angles, and the Dragons Tail alſo.
He further ſays, Aſcendens fgnificat imitium iliuscuju,
ºff res, & Dominus Aſcendentis, Medium; & Dominus
Domini Aſcendentis ſignificat finem illius cujus eſt res. And
herein, the Reciprocal and Receptional poſition of the
Lord of the Eighth, andLord of the Aſcendant expound
the Ruleexactly as ſhallappear by the matter of Faët,
which was thus.-- - . .
As ſoon as this curious Built Ship was fittedfor Service,
that Honourable and Valiant Perſon, Sir Robert Holms,
was Graced with the Command of her, or ſhe rather,
with ſucha Worthy Commander. And in her he bravely
Fought the Dutch, and did Gallant Service againſt them,

as well in open Sea, as at the Ply. You ſee the Mºon
is in Trine of Mars, making her ſucceſsful enough for
Aćtion, though not for Duration. For after all the No.
ble Services performed in her, ſhe was laid up in Har
- bour in the Thames; where, on De--
vid. Ptol, cinliloq; cember the 8th, 1668. ſhe (being
Mph. 55. then not full three years old) was,
- by an unhappy accident Fired, and
makeuncapable of Service.
We have an old Proverb, which ſays, Tide will ſta
for no Man. And it is true; but if one Tide be not fit
for thefavouring fo Eminenta matter, as the Launchin
of ſucha Ship, it had been nogreatinjury to havetarried
for another. But now this Gallant Ship is loſt, it is too
late to complain. - -
Any one vers'd in Aſtrology will tell you, That at the
very time thisVeſſel was burned, it laboured under the
malicious Influences of two bad Directions, viz. The
Aſcendant to the Body of Mars, and the AMoon to the
Pleiades. And; what if I ſhould tell you, That the en
vious Planet Saturn, was juſt upon the Aſcendant in its
Revolutional Figure for that year? It is true. And isal.
waysdangerous, as well inthe Nativities of Ships, asof
Men, when ill Direţiions happen. — Theſe are no illu,
.# Impoſtures, but concluding Truths...And, I could |
wiſh thatAſtrology were more univerſally underſtood, `
thatſuchEminentDangersmight be ſhund and avoided;
or, at the leaſt, mitigated.—— -
By this Inſtance we find, that the Influences of the
Stars extend themſelvesto Things, as well as Men: And
thatthere isnothing in Art or Nature, but is guided (ful
Deo)by Aſtral Power. . . . - s

In the Nativity of this curious, but uncouth Weſſel,
wefind as well the Decanate as Terms of Saturn to aſ:
cend the Eaſtern Finitor; and the Pleiades, a violent tur
bulent Cöſtellation there. The Moon was in Oppoſition of
Saturnand Mercury, andcarrying their Light tothe Sun,
by the ſame unhappy Beam; and Venu, Lady of the Ho
roſcope, is in Conjunètion with Cauda Draconis, in Domo
Saturni. All which, by Aphoriſms the 4, 6, 17. 18.
before-mentioned, were dangerous, and denoted a ſhort
Life and a violent Death, to this neat built Weſſel. And
accordingly, notwithſtanding the Rarity and Curioſity
of her Contrivance, ſhe was not ſuffered long to pleaſe
the eyes of the World. For in, or about the middle of
November 1665. viz. a Year and a Month from its firſt
Launching, it was caſt away in a violent Storm about
Tarmouth-Road.-- It is obſervable, That Saturn was

thereof. , A Tranſit very dangerous indeed,becauſe they

This curious Weſſel was called the Royal Catherine,
in Honourof our moſt Gracious and PiousQueen Kathe
zine. And, (for a ſecret Aſtral Reaſon) I am of Opini
on, That the Appellation will prove an Omen of much
advantage unto it.
That this Noble Veſſelſhall both do, and ſuffer, many
times, great violence; is moſt manifeſt from the Moon,
her applying adoppoſitum Martis, from violent parts of
the Heavens; and from their being in Quadrate Aſpett
of the Aſcendant, and Seventh Angles; as alſo from its
beingLaunchedin hora Saturni. -

But that it ſhall be capable of doing more and greater
violence, then it can poſſibly undergo or ſuffer, is well
denoted by the Great and Signal Receptionsof jupiter,
with Saturn, and Mars; as alſo by jupiter his beingin
—partil Sextile of theSun, and above the Earth diurnally,
/which Aſtrologers call his Hayne: and theſe Teſtimonies
are added unto very happily, in that the Aſcendant is
befriended by jupiter, Sol, and Mercury.— And, al
though jupiter be in Capricornhis fall, Mercury(Lord of
theSeventh) is both Retrogradeand Combuſt, and hath no
aſſiſtance but what he receives from jupiter. As if this
curious Weſſel were, not only promiſed Vićtory overher
| Enemies, but to be kind unto them afterwards, and to
do them manifeſt Curteſies. -
If the Aſcendant be Hylech, I am ſure jupiter muſt
be Alchocoden, or Dominus Annorum, and declares
thiscurious built Weſſel to continue, from the time of its
firſt Launching, at the leaſt his middle years: perhaps
(for the Reaſons before-mentioned) ſhe may reach unto
his great years.

As the Ship it ſelf is a very curious goodly Veſſel in

the HonourableCommandersthereof, will, (I have a con

Here are not leſs than five Planets above the Earth in
this Figure; and threeof them eſſentially dignified; and
all the Planets in Configuration with oneanother.
* If Planets, being above the Earth, dart forth the moſt
powerful Atoms or Influences, upon Perſons or Things,
born, or begun under them; this curious Shipmuſt hap
pily ſhare therein, and that toan Eminent degree. And,
if the Dignities of the Planets preſage publick Honour
and Succeſs, &c. this gallant Weſſel will never fail there
of; nor yet of ſuch Employment, Aëtion, or Service, that
ſhall neceſſarily be an Indućtion thereunto. Variety

The Fate of this Ship is like to be ſuch, that ſhe willout

profeſs to be ignorant of thoſe notable Arguments for
Aćtion and Succeſs mention'd; as alſo, of all the Planets
(Saturn excepted) being very ſwift in motion inthis Ra

Ağrologers tell us,that a Trine of the Sun and Saturn in
the Genitures of Perſons, (chiefly, from the Aſcending
part of Heaven) ſhews them not only Honourable, and
Eminent, &c. but gives them Power or command over
the Lives and Fortunes of others.- Why may not
this goodly Veſſel then, have the ſame good Fortune, and
Command over Ships, as the Perſons, &c. over Men 2
But herein, is, not only a Trine of the Sun and Saturn,

The Sun is Hylech, being in the Medium Caeli, with an

notably adds to the former mention'd Arguments of Suc.

The Friendly Planet Venus, is Alchocoden, or giver of

This is the very time that Captain Owen Cox (my ve

to a Voyage forthe Straights, &c.— He had my Opinion .
upona Horary Question of the ſucceſs ofhis Voyagebe-,
fore; which when I come to my third part of Inſtances, T
I intend to inſert at large; as I haveformerly (viz., in my
Ephemeris Anno 1667.) done it already.
Only,here we are to take notice that this Election (Ido ||
not meanof this Captains own framing, but oftheFates; "
as you ſhall hereafter be informed) is a moſt pernicious
one inearneſt; and, as unfortunate, as the effect it ſelf
was fatal. -
For firſt, the Aſcendant and ſeventh Houſe are both in .
the terms of Mars; and the Aſcendant and its Lord in .
Azimen and Pitted Degrees. Secondly, the Moon is in
Tenebrous degrees, and entring the Via Combuſta. The
former is rendred dangerous by the 25 Aphoriſm, and the
latterby the third. Thirdly, the AMoon is in Quadrate
Aſpett of Saturn and Mercury; which by Aphoriſm 18. A
preſages the loſs of the Veſſel. -
The Moon ('tis true) is applying ad trinum Jovis;
but to what purpoſef HebeingLord of the Eighth, and
in Oppoſition to the Aſcendant. The fifth Aphoriſm alſo, %
Horoſcope it ſelf is naturally unfortunate, it being, as ſº
Cardancallsit, ſignum infeliciſſimum; a Sign moſt unhap

the Veſſel it ſelf ſhould meet with Enemies, and that the

any Man tell me in what Science, now in uſe among
Mortals, we may meet perfection ? Surely not. No,
although Geometry it ſelf be Courted for it.
An Aſtrologer ſhould be modeſt in his Prediſtions, and
not too confident. The knowledge of particular kinds
of things, is, not only denied Mortals by God and Na

attained by them. See Aph. i. Centiloq. We need not

Behold the effects of an Oppoſition of the Aſoon and

Influence thereof being aggravated and increaſed by the
Oppoſition of Saturn and Mars. $º
It is not for nothing, that Aſtrologers have aſſigned an
equal Government to Mercury with Saturn in the Airy
Trigon. Had not Penus been in Trine of Saturn, and in
Sextile of Mars and jupiter; and that the Sun (though

Thuswe ſee, theremaybe Naumachies or Conflićts at

And the Merchant ſaved allhis Premium Money, which

earneſtly laboured to comfort the Querent: who, bein
ſignified by Mars,in Platique Oppoſitionof Saturn, coul
ſcarce give credit to me, his fears wereſo great.
From the Poſition of Venus in the Ninth Angle, and,
... forthatthe Moon wasſwift in Motion, and (by Latitude)

! quainted him, that I conceived the Veſſel was on itsway
homeward, and would be heard of ſpeedily. Yet, I
ſuppoſed ſhe had been a little affrighted by Enemies, as
alſoby Tempeſtuous Weather; becauſe Wenus was late
ly ſeparated both from a Conjunètion of Mars, and an
Oppoſition of Saturn, and it was true.
For, the Ship was heard of in a fortnights time from
the propounding this Queſtion; and came home very
well, and in good condition, in November following:
But, ſhe had been chaſed by ſome Pirates in her way
homeward, which ſhe very hºwed Some in

mated the ſame to have been in ſome danger (to my ap
prehenſion) not only by Weather, but Enemies, &c.—
Howbeit, the Moon applying ad Trinum Saturni, and
Saturn ſo eminently ſtrong in the Eleventh from the St
venth, caſting a Trine to the Second of the Eigure; toge
ther with theSun and jupiter haſtning to a Conjunction in
the Seventh. –
From all which Arguments, I concluded the Veſſel
fafe, (though lately in ſome danger, &c.) and that ſhe
would be heard of, if not come home, in three weeks or
amonths time at the fartheſt. You ſee the Sun wanted
but three Degreesof the Body of jupiter.
The matter of Faćt was thus. On March the 6th,
following, ſhe came home; but hadbeen diſtreſſed very
muchby ill Weather in her return, and forced to make
many Ports before her Arrival, for relief – Here
you ſee, the Sun and fupiter did not ſignifie Enemies as I
feared; but the Moon (being in the Dignities of Mercu
ry) in Oppoſition of the Sun and jupiter, had Relation
to the Weather only, though from the Angle of Enemies.
I will not hereenquire, whether the Weather may not
be as well the greateſt Enemy, as Friend to Maritime
matters? Becauſe I meant Martial Enemies when I gave
my Opinion hereon. I was, I confeſs, in that particular
deceived. — How even, and calm, ought the mind of

One of them being much afflićted thereat, in great

and the Figure of Heaven wasas here repreſented.
The Moon withCauda Draconis, and ſhe, and Saturn,
inQuadrate of the Sun and Aſars, were eminent Argu

had been much diſtreſſed both by Weather, and ł,Pi

(though accidentally fallen into the Sixth Angle, which
isthe Twelfth from the Seventh) and that the Luminaries
were Angular; and, that theSun was in Sextile of ju
piter, Lord of the Medium Caeli; and he Lord of the
Querents Second Houſe; and that the Pars Fortune, and
moſt of the Planets,were in Fortunate Points or Degrees
of Heaven; and alſo, that the Hour it ſelf was gover

ſhe had been inſome hazardous condition, becauſe Saturn

Trine of Saturn, and Sextile of jupiter, (though ſepara
ted) and jupiter the Diſpoſiter of Venu, which ſignified
theShip. Neitherdid I forget that jupiter Governed the
Hour; or that Venu, caſt her Sextile to Mars, to miti
gate his Fury; or, yet, that Benefique Stars, of the Na
ture of Venus and Mercury, did Deſcend on the Cuſp of
the Seventh Angle. -
But, the Arguments of her Labouringunder the hard
ſhip mentioned, were, Mars infeſting her Aſcendant,
and Saturn his being in Quadrate of Venus, Lady there
of; together, with his being in Oppoſition to jupiter her
Diſpoſiter.
By this you ſee, that when there are good and bad
Teſtimoniesin your Figure, the Effects attending the in
terrogated matter, will prove accordingly.— And, if
the Arguments of Succeſs, be greater than thoſe of Miſ
fortune, be ſure you ſhall find ſafety to ſucceed on the
gueſtion. But, yet,ſhalltheill Rays of the Planetshave
their Effects too, according to their Natures and Rela
tions,

ſon enquiring, and of the Ship too, and in the ãº
of the Figure, in Sextile of jupiter, and in goºd Aſºº
to both the Aſcendant of the Querent, and Keſel, did.}
fire encourage me. And when, together with this
ºnfidered that Saturn was in Sextile of the Sun in t

eithertothe Weſſel, or Querent; and alſo thatbothLumin

the Hour,-i- I was ſufficiently perſwaded that thiſ
veſſeſwas ſafe; and encouraged the Querent according
ly to be of the ſame Opinion with me. - i º
To be brief. The Ship was ſafe; yet ha
been in ſome ſmall Danger, but camehappily home, all:
well inden. But (as the Querent afterwards acquainté
me) ſhe came to no good Market, other Ships havi w
brought in their Stores beforeher. -

But the Querent (though reſolv’d ſufficiently to follow
my adviſe) being a little unwilling to part with an 0.
Servant too haſtily, did ſomewhat delay the Sale there
of.--— And behold, in ten weeks time from t
Queſtion, asſhe was going to New-Caſtle for Coals, wi

Hereinwe muſt accept of Mercury forthe proper Sig
nificator of the Veſſel Interrogated. And, he being in
the Eleventh Houſe of the Figure, no way afflićted or
impedited; and the Luminariº, in Friendly Trine of each
Other, and the Aſcendant being Fortunated, and Fortified
|by Penus her preſence there, together with the Sun his
Governing the Hour. All which were Arguments that
might very reaſonably denote the Veſſel to be in ſafety.
[And ſoſhe was...] And this, nonobſtante Saturn his being
in Quadrate tothe Seventh Houſe, and in the ſame Aſpett
of the Aſcendant.
, And, becauſe I found that Mercury, inten days time
from the Queſtion, came ad Trinum Saturni, Lord ofthe
werent's Second Houſe, and to a Sextile of jupiter his
Diſpoſter; and that the Moons next Aſpect, (after a
ſmall Vacuum Curſus) wasto a Trine of Venus in the Aſ
cendant, and this without Fruſtration. I told the Que:
rent (from thence) that he might (Favente Deo) moſt
probably hear of the Weſſel, or ſee her at, or much about
that time. He did not much believeme; jupiter you ſee
isin Oppoſition of Saturn, heightening the Querents fears.
Howbeit, he was a little enlightened in his humour, by
my Encouragement. •
The Truth of the Effect was thus. The Weſſel did
thencomeſafe home, and very well Laden alſo; to my
nolittle Credit, and to the Satisfaction of the Querent.
Thus you ſee, that if Saturn, Mars, or Cauda
Draconis, in the Aſcendant, deſtroy the hopes
of the Queſtion ; Venus or Jupiter Poſited therein, (not
otherwiſe contradićted) preſerve it.

- ThisVeſſel by contrary winds, had been driven from

time; which occaſioned (as itmight well) great fears in I
the Querent, that ſhe was totally loſt in the Sea. And,
beingin the mind to Enſure what he had upon her, was
firſt deſirous to know my Opinionthereof, from a Figure
of Heaven, which happen'd to be this as you ſee.
Finding the Moon, which claim'd Exaltation in the
Seventh Angle, to be in Conjunction of jupiter, in the
AMid-Heaven, and he Governing the Hora Queſtionis;
and, that Venus, the proper Significatrix of the Ship, was
in the Aſcendant in Sextile of Mars Lord thereof, in the
Tenth Hoſe. It was encouragement ſufficient for me,
to give my Judgment. — That the Veſſel was ſafe,
and very probably in Harbour; and that I did believe he
would have News of her being alive and well, in a ſhort
time. Nay, I thereforefurther adviſed him not to En.
ſure, the Arguments of Hopes were ſo ſtrong.
The Querent followed my Adviſe, and, had norea.

This Weſſel was a Trader to New-Caſtle, and being
longer out than was uſual, put the Owner of her into -
ſeveral fears, that all was not well with her. And, in
great perplexity of mind, he movedthe above-ſaid Que
ftion concerning itto me, under this Poſition of Heaven. . .
Venus is Significatrix of the Weſſel, and Retrograde, in
her Detriment, and by Retrogradation applying to Com
buſtion of the Sun, and he Lord of the Fourth Houſe in
the Question ; which plainly argued that the Ship was in
logood condition,- And, when, together with this, I
- COil

conſidered the Moon was in exact Oppoſition of Saturn,
and, both of them in Quadrate Aſpett to the ſeventh
Angle, I told the Quºrent poſitively, that I believed
all was not well; and that I feared, his Weſſel was in
great hazard of looſing, if not already loſt; becauſe }
and h wereſo exač and Diametrically oppoſite.
The Truth of the Effect was thus:- The Ship was
heard of inſix days time; and though not loſt, yet had
ſhe been in great danger thereof, having unhappily run
on Ground at Nem-Cašle, and ſo, not only ſprünga
Shrowd, but wholly loſt her Keel, which put theOwner
to a great deal of Coſts to Repair, before ſhe could be
fittedfor Sailing again.
Honeſt Reader, I will readily acknowledge to thee,
I am buta Man, and therefore am often ſubjećt to com:
mit Error in my Judgments, ’tis a Crime I hope thou
wilt pardon. . . It is connived at in Phyſicians (I will not
ſay 'tistolerable inthem)if they endanger Lives, before
they come to a right º: of their Profeſſion.
Shall not the poor Aſtrologer be indulged a little, if he
be found to give a miſtaken, judgment? His after Expe

there, and nearly in Oppoſition of the San, and Quadrate

By w A y o F
PostsCRIPT
S forthe foregoing Diaryof the Weather,ſome
Men (ſuch as know how to value their pre
cious Hours) would fancy they had deſerv'd
well atthe hands of the World by ſo greata º
Labour, and ſokind a Communication. But I, who never ||
knew what it was to Adore the Great Mundane Goddeſs,
INTEREST; eſpecially when ſet in competition with |
TRUTH, dare not challenge anything from it of Merit.
He lives to little (if to any) purpoſe on this Terrene ||
Theatre, that makesno Obſervations on Natures Viciſt.
tudes: and if he makeany, and not inform the World
thereof to the beſt of his Skill, he does it no Service at
all; Isa Drone for all his Induſtry; or like the churliſh
Aſſºr, makes a Feaſt only for himſelf. - -
£ut, alas! I am none of the 2axo'opi'aazac, or Hail.
Obſervers inOrdinary, as Seneca mentions, in Lib 4.Nat.
gueſt. and yet dare ſay I have impartedin this Diary, as
many Meteorological Rarities, as if, with them, I had
Sacrificed a Lamb or a Pullet. It is a Free-will Offering,
and done at my own Charges too; No Man contributes
to the Pains of my Notturnal Watchings, nor do I, or
ever did, receiveany Salary to recompence my Diurnal
Słłditſ. Ideem it Guerdon ſufficient, and am fully ſa
"POSTS CRIPT.
isfied, if what I have done ſerve to inform future Ages,
how for their ſakes, more then my own, I have been thus
Sedulous in waiting upon Nature, and obſerving how
mutably (yet conſtantly too) ſhe hath vouchſafed to ſhew
her ſelf tous Sub-Lunars for XXI Years together. Poſ
fibly, twill appear ſome Novelty even tothe moſt Intelli
gent Reader (if he have not done the like himſelf, as I
ueſtion not but many have;) and ſuchthat he'll not every
- 3. or inevery Book receive an account of No! Not
in the Polumes of ſome who Pride themſelves with the
Trim and Gaudy Titles of Wertuoſo's in this Envious and
Critical Age. -
The Induſtrious and Modeſt Reader, who truly Thirſts
or Pants after an acquaintance with the works of God,
will thank me for thus lending him mine Eyes, and for
doing ſogreat,but uſeful a peice of Drudgery forthe ſer
vice of the Divine Orania. While in the mean time,
the envious Sciolift will perhaps diſdain the work, and
cry Tuſh Termit a Trifle: and it may be, will be ſo
thankleſs and ungrateful, as to tell me, I might have
ſpent mytime to betterpurpoſe, if (with Sir W. P.) I had
numberedall the Lawyers Chimneys in theſeveral Inns of
Court in London; orfull as well, if I had ſlept away my
time with Lampatho's Spaniel. But, do not all wiſe Men
know, that Envy hath no Commerce, or Communication
with true Induſtry. The invidious Man, like the Dog
in the Manger, is never contented; he'll do nothinghim- .
ſelf, yet be ſtill ſnarling at the performance of others.
Howbeit, jačia eſt Aleå. The work is done, and I am
proof againſt all Cenſure. The Commendation of Good
Men will not make me Proud, neither ſhall I value what
witty Malice, orgroſs Impudence can ſpeak, or do againſt
theſe my Endeavours.
That worthy Gentleman Dočtor Beal, Votes it uſeful,
for the Advancement of Natural Philoſophy, to have old
Almanacks ſprote rather than mem ones: To give an account
of paſt, ratherthan of future Storms. Which were in
deed, (beyond Queſtion) the ready road to come to a

right underſtandingof the Heavenly Influences. And, if :
God ſpare my (much envy'd) Life, I reſolveſhortly, to
Reprint all Ephemerides that (to my knowledge)have been
Jºrinted ſince the firſt Diſcovery of that moſt Excellent
Art, (for ſo itis, if not to baſe purpoſesproſtituted) and
perhaps may add unto them the Planetary Motions for
Fifty or a Hundred Years before that time; (if my
Friends, and Amanuenſes fail me not ) Whereby, not
only the Cauſes of all Storms, but of moſt other amazing
Aſundane Piriffitudes, for theſaid number of Years, may
beplainly ſeen. , Aſtrology wanteth its Hiſtory as much,
(if not more) than any other Science; That being the
only via regia to its Perfeótion,as wasworthily and truly
obſerved by the Ingenious Dočtor Childrey.
Ifind it Recorded in the Hiſtory of Oxfordſhire, ſet
forth by the Learned Dr. Plott, as a Rarity worth the
preſerving— That one William Merle, Fellow of Mer
ton-Colledgein Oxford, Compileda Diary of theWea
ther for VII., rears, together. Fol. 6. If ſuch a piece of
ſervice for the Planetary Philoſophy, were worthy to be
remembred to Poſterity, certainly, a Diary of triplethe
length, will not, withthe Ingeniousand knowing Natu
raliſt, be refuſed a Friendly Entertainment into his
Thoughts, and Library. -
It was the Opinion of the late Excellent Dr. Goad.
That the Heavens andStars were like a well-order'd Inſtru:
ment which the Planets making their Appulſes to, or Paſſing
by, do conſtantlyſtimulateſuch Influences as are agreeableto
their Natures, and to the conſtellations inhence they pro
ceed. As a skillful hand touching the ſeveral Pegs of the
Harpſtchord, or Kirginals, movethem to diſcourſe to the
Ear variety of Melodious Aires.— And, have you not
heardof the Muſique of the Sphears 2 -
The Noble Plutarch thinks that on every Carleſtial
Orb there isa Syren fixed, who, by vertueof her Ra
wiſhing Charms, Creates, not only Admiration, but De
light among Mortals. This is certain, that the ſerious
Obſervations made of the Stupendious variety of weather,
which
- P U S I S. C. R. I PI.
which one ſingle year affords, is ſufficient to ſtrike the
Atheiſt Dumb for ever: and can teach us to Honour,
Love, and Fear Him whobrings forth Mazzaroth in his
Seaſon, andGuides Araturus with his Sons.
Many are the uſes unto whichthis Diary is Applicable.
I. It will prove to us, and that by more than CXL.
Inſtances, (if any will take but the pains as I have done
to obſerve them.) That the Heavens are ever ſubjećt to
Diſturbance and Onquietude, when Mercury Changes his
Sign. Probably one main reaſon why theAntient Aſtrolo
gers have Affigned him a Government equal to Saturn in
the Airy Trygon. - -
II. That we havea fall of wet upon every New or Full
Moon, at leaſt withinthe compaſs of the Triduum,which
Rarely failing verity is Eminently ſupported by Dr.
Goad in his Aftro-Meteorologica, Conſult hisadmirable
Hiſtory of the Moon therein. -
III. That the Sun, Venus, Mars, do occaſion the like
Commotions and Alterations as Mercury, more or leſs,
when They paſs from one Sign to another.— Dočtor
Goad, conſidering the certainty of Mars his Effetts in
the Mutation of the Air, was pleas'd to term him his
IDOL. See his Learned Diſcourſe of the Pleiades. And
thisour Diary affordsabundant Proofof this Truth to any
Man that ſhallbe pleaſed to take the pains toobſerve it.
IV. That all the aforeſaid Planets paſſing by, or riſing
or ſetting with the Fixed Stars, as are the Pleiades, Aſelli,
Windemiator, Eagle , Dolphin, &c. or tranſiting their
Oppoſite places, do produce an alteration in the Air, ſuta
bleto the Natures of thoſe Conſtellations,and to that of the
ſeveralSeaſonsofthe Year. The Learned Hartgilaffirm'd
an Influence in the Aſpetts of the Fixed Stars, as well as
in the Erratique. - -
V. That hereby is ſufficiently evinced to every Indu
ſtriousand Skilful Obſerver, how the Four Seaſons of the
ſtar, viz. Winter, Summer, Spring, Authmm, * to be
- - Qll!
"POST S C R IP T.
found,and fairly diſtinguiſhed, even in a Lunar Revolution,
(and in theſ/inter Seaſon too) according tothe Opinion of
Cicero, de Divin; Lib. 2. though not ſo palpably, I muſt
confeſs, as inthe Solar; by reaſon of the Moons velocity
of Motion, and often largeneſs of the Shadow, and of the
Cold, which is Naturally and univerſally then prevailing.
VI. That the greateſt ſhare of ColdWeather in Summer,
or of Warmweather in Winter,(for ſuch Variety is plainly
to be found almoſt in every year; but in ſome moſt re
markable) happens when the Moon, and Ruling Planets
are poſited in Winter or Summer Signs.
VII. That the Planets or Lunations, or Conjunctions,
or Oppoſitions Regnant, happening in Azimene, Deep,
Pitted or Smoaky Degrees of the Signs they poſſeſs, do
irritate the moſt Unwholſome and Unhealthy Storms, and
Disturbed weather. Pray obſerve a Famous proofhereof
in the New Moon ſucceeding New-Tears-day laſt, which
was Celebrated in ſuch Degrees; and at the ſame time
Mars being in Degrees Azimene, and Pitted, and the
Moon paſſing Aquarius, where almoſt half the Sign con
ſiſts of ſuch like Degrees. And lo! What a continuant
Storm for near three days and nightstogether, happen'd im:
mediately after. Let us remember alſo the Fogs that fell
on September, the 29th. and 30th. days; and on Decem
ber the 22d. and 23d, days, Anno 1682. And conſider
how the Planets were then Poſited. To theſe we may
juſtly add theſeveral Foul Holes which Dr. Goad hathſo
happily ſet up his Mark at. You may find which they are,
by theSecond Part ofmy Ephemerides,Printed, Anno 1680.
where (that ſo uſeful a Diſcoverymight not be obliviated,
with the conſent of that my Worthy Friend) I have inſer.
ted them.
VIII. That the Conjunctions, Oppoſitions, and Luna
tions, &c. of the Sun, Moon, and Planets fallingin Bright,
Litcid and Fortunate Parts of Heaven, are commonly at.
tended with Pleaſant Air, and very Salubrious Effe:#;
but ſtill with regard to the Seaſon. Pray try theſe things,
3 truſt them as you find them true. I could produce
“Po STscº 1'PT:
Fundry Inſtances of this Conſpicuous Truth, both out of
This, and alſo out of the Learned Keplers, Diary. But
that is needleſs,ſince youmay diſcover them here,even by
INSPECTION, in a manner, without further trouble.
It being much eaſier to prove theſe things by Inſpection,
than the troubleſome Calculations of the PlanetsPlaces,
as ſome lately, with more Confidence than Truth, have
preſumed to do. . . -
IX. That hereby is,taught and proved, that the latter
part of Canceris the Hotteſt part of the whole Heaven.
And alſo, that the laſt week in May is generally inclined
to Moiſture. There are but three Inſtances in the whole
Diary that oppoſe it; andeven thoſeproducegreat Heats,
which are the certain Prodromi, (if not the proper Pa.
rents) of Moisture. And, for a clear Demonſtration of
the Former,(beſidesmany others) you may conſult june
1673. May 1675. September 1689. Auguſt 1682. §u
ly, in the years 1684, 1686, 1688. I need not be more
plain in a thing ſo obvious. In all your Exceptions to our
Rule, muſt advertiſe youtoheed theprevailingconſtitution.
X. That Planets near the AEquinoxes are of the moſt
Powerful, and rarely failing Influences. And this the
Learned Woffius, and moſt Naturalists, allow of A Fa
mous Evidence whereof is the Month of AMarch, in its
proving Windy, Turbulent, &c. to a Proverb. Chiefly,
the latter part thereof; the Sun being then in Aries, in
Oppoſition to the Virgins Spike. Nor is it much different
in September, when the Sun is in the Autumnale/Equinox.
Neither do the other Planets fail to irritate the ſame re
markable Commotions or Turbulencies, when they alſo in
their Turns approach the 44ttinoxes. This is general.
But the Learned Goad goes further, and affirms that the
Weather may be found, not only to a Week, and Day,
but timeof the Dayalſo; For the Planet Mars (faith hey
Strikes the Hour of the Day as well as the Clock. And this
chiefly when in the AFauinoxes, &c.
XI. Hence likewiſe is plainly proved that the rear

climate,more than LXX. Daysfraught with that Meteor; .
And ſometimes the Solar Revolution produceth 80. 90.
may an 100 days of Froft in them.Which conſidered, may
we not juſtly brand ſuch Almanack Men among us, for
Ignorant Impoſfors, that pretend to give anaccountofthe
eather, and yet ſcarce afford us a mention of oneFrofty
Day in a whole year. Theſe filly Wretches forget,That
3|aniocer, is 3free;21Bot by the #ire. But I am notfor
Controverſy. - -
xii is the Eaſt wind (as the Learned Mr. Rºn
obſerves) do moſt commonly prevail in the Spring with
us. But we find the West-winds more generally accom ||
pany us all the year; as the whole Diary moſt plainly |
affirms in its Evidence.
And is it thus in the Alterations of the Air, and Seaſon:
of the rear 2 Then certainly we ſhall find Aſtrology ſo
far from being an Inanity, or a Sonorous Nothing, asa
more witty, than wiſe Antagoniſt (viz. Dr. More) has
been pleaſed toterm it; That we may reaſonably affirm ||
it will hold good in other matters, viz., even in Mundant :
Mutations: and moſt probably alſo, in the va
rious Deſtinies of Men. Yea, perhaps, in the common
Oeconomy of all Humane Concerns: Werewebut ſowiſe
and fortunate as to find out the Myſtery. Nay, Idare
aver, that Men and Women may learn by the Stars good
Husbandry, and Huſvifery, though they never were ſo
happy as to be acquainted with the QBeazgicks. Some
what of this Nature I have formerly hinted at in myCar.
dines Cali ; wrote in Reply to ſome part of Cometoman.
tia, unto which Book I refer the Reader.
It were nohard matter to produce out of this Diary
Variety of Inſtances for a further Dilucidation of this
3ury of Particulars, havingthem Collected in readineſs
by me. But to publiſh them atlarge, wouldrequire more
Copious room to breath in,neither isit very fit Furniture
for a Poſtſcript.'Tisſufficient that I have heredeliver'd the
INSTRUMENT, for the ſervice of the Ingenious, and
likewiſe Explain'd to them (in part at leaſt) to what#
- '. mirablº
- If U Y. I y C, IC I tº 1.
mirable Aires it is Tuneable. If Men are but meanly In
duſtrious, they will very ſoonlearn to Play thereon, and
that without much Study or Tutoring.
Happy, yea more than thrice happy muſt that Man be,
who comes truly to underſtand how God Almighty is
pleaſed by the Agency of the Stars and Planets, to King
the various PEALS of his PROVIDENCE on this Ter
rene Globe, ſometimes to the Pleaſing, othertimes to the
Amazing QHomber of Humane Ears. He that knows,
and Religiouſly admires how the Sun, Moonand Stars do
Praiſe their Maker,isto be look'd on as one ofthebeſt ſort
of Men and Chriſtians, being in Poſſeſsion of ſome part
of Caleftial Verity, and little leſs than a Privy Councellor
of Heaven. .
To conclude, the Caeleſtial Orbs diſown all Anti-A40
- marchical, Diſloyal, and Rebellious Principles. There
are no Commonwealth;-men (falſely ſo called) to befound
in thoſe Superiour Franchiſes. All are for Monarchy in the
Heavenly Regency,and readily bow toone Supreme Being,
upon whoſe Regular Motion that of all others depend.
