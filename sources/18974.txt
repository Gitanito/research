you
now here I&#39;m gonna share in a moment a
few of these sort of techniques and when
you&#39;re first starting out it&#39;s you know
most people need some things to just
sharpen their ability and I want to go
through a over the next half hour or so
and then we&#39;ll take a break a sort of
the atmospherics of this first and then
a few little techniques when I say the
atmospherics
it&#39;s an attitudinal first there&#39;s this
positive affirmation but it&#39;s very
important to understand that say you&#39;re
in a deep meditative state and you&#39;re
you&#39;re going into quiet meditation so
that you can then be in a expanded state
of mind to remote-view a place or an
object or an ET craft the mistake most
people make is letting the intellect
jump in and force it again this problem
with forced things instead of letting it
unfold I have found that if you&#39;re in a
very deep relaxed state or even taking a
nap but you just gently intend as you&#39;re
going in and out of the dream state or
sleep state or in and out of the quiet
meditative state to know something it&#39;s
an intending and then just relax and let
it flow into you and get yourself out of
the way so get your intellect and ego
out of the way it&#39;ll pop in like that
and the last week I&#39;ve had amazing
things pop in that I&#39;ve been sharing
with my film and Technology team and
that&#39;s really how it happens and it&#39;s a
it&#39;s it this is a really critical part
of the this holistic technique for
remote viewing I don&#39;t particularly
recommend the ones that are been
military based the so called you know s
are that scientific remote
RV and it&#39;s all these things I like the
approach where you develop the
understanding and experience of deep
consciousness understand that that
consciousness is omnipresent and that at
a quiet level of the mind we are deeply
quiet you can enter into this field of
consciousness that&#39;s just this side of
the absolute unbounded field into the
relative expression of forms and
archetypes something called Ritambhara
Pragya rhythm the level where all things
are can be known now you know the great
beam knows all things at all times and a
very enlightened person may know a
thousand things at one time through
consciousness but each of us can get in
that state and know one or two or ten or
five things at a time whatever it is
this is make sense and written bara
Praga is actually a level or a structure
within the architecture of consciousness
and nonlocality where everything can be
known past present future and that&#39;s why
and by the way because it&#39;s in the
embedded within the structure of the
consciousness field it&#39;s in every one of
you you don&#39;t have to go anywhere where
is this book of all knowledge I said
read thyself know thyself it&#39;s all
within you but you need to understand
the techniques hi
the magnetometer chattering interesting
you you want to be able to to experience
that state of consciousness and then
relax into it and let it flow through
you and then the answer will be there
the answer will just come now there are
many ways to do it the meditative state
and then going deep and then relaxing
and allowing it took to be seen that&#39;s
one way dream time I mentioned this
before you went to bed it was getting
late I would have gone more into this
you&#39;re asleep though as you would be
going to sleep get a journal keep
something by your bedside
and begin to affirm to yourself that you
can have lucid dreaming be awake within
the dream and you can travel to places
and know things and that state like the
aboriginals of Australia have dream time
to Cherokee my ancestors on my mother
died my dad was half Cherokee Indian had
this in their tradition of dreaming and
many cultures do it&#39;s only reductionist
Western relatively recent culture that
has knocked that out of our paradigm so
we re own that capability and that is a
tremendously effective way to remove you
Wow I had this set at zero and its
goodness alright and you can begin to
practice that on a nightly basis and as
you do it it&#39;ll begin to go up and up
and up in in accuracy you know I met my
wife in a precognitive lucid dream you
know that I guess Oh in the book hidden
hidden truth forbidden knowledge which
is my kind of autobiography and get it
serious disclosure calm it goes through
all this but I had four or five dreams
in a row in one week where it was very
loose and I awakened into that state and
you know I was 22 years old when I was
no more interested in being married than
the man in the moon and this woman was
introduced to me by this very spiritual
enlightened being and said this is who
we wish for you to marry I went and gave
me all that gave me all the details
about her that she would be coming from
far away that she&#39;s somebody somewhat
older than you but that&#39;s not gonna be a
problem I was 22 she was like maybe 30
or something and very detailed and I
have a friend I turn to I said yeah I
mean having these dreams is so strange I
said I need to look for who this person
is but I&#39;m really not interested in
really being married right now and
so about a month later I&#39;m in Israel up
on Mount Carmel near the caves of Carmel
and all that in the end and suddenly
this woman walks through the gates of
these beautiful gardens where the Baha&#39;i
Zev the shrine to gorgeous gardens and
as her well you don&#39;t go up to a
stranger and say hello my name&#39;s Steve
and I&#39;ve had this dream and we&#39;re
supposed to get married so we you know
she just comes over to me and starts
talking and we talked for about an hour
and it&#39;s like we had always known each
other
she also practiced meditation she was in
the Peace Corps
we&#39;re in Barbados and was known as st. M
she was such a beautiful soul do an
occupational therapy helping rehab
cerebral palsy children and stroke
victims and and so we just that was it I
didn&#39;t even get I just gave her my name
we didn&#39;t exchange information and she
and I I said a prayer I said God if this
is who I&#39;m supposed to marry she&#39;s gonna
have to reach out to me I&#39;m they were
gonna contact her this is too big of a
deal so she felt so compelled before she
could even get back to the Caribbean she
was meeting her mom in London and
remembered my name contact a place where
I was working and sent a letter there
was no email and or anything back then
this is 1978 and basically said can you
get this letter to Steve Greer because
and it got to me I said oh that&#39;s it and
so I then wrote her this long epistle
about what happened and it was shocking
and so we correspond it for a year and
then had a 10-day courtship and it lasts
Alaska we just want to go somewhere
different and decided we&#39;d be married
and that was 37 years ago
I know my children say you guys win the
prize for being the freakiest parents
and our wedding pictures oh boy
anyway very embarrassed you imagine
having me as a father how embarrassing
or a grandfather yet I have eight
grandkids but so that&#39;s it so I tell
people this is I&#39;m you know this is
walking the talk here every important
thing in my life has been the result of
the lucid dream remote viewing
meditative state and guidance for you
know 40 50 years so that&#39;s how I think
you should begin to think of how your
life can be guided and your contact with
the ETS can be guided and your
relationships at work and family can be
guided very intuitive you don&#39;t take
leave of your intellect or anything else
but you add this to it and it creates a
beautiful world and a beautiful life for
you
that&#39;s so another approach to remote
viewing is doing that in that dream
state the other is when you&#39;re going to
sleep or mostly when you&#39;re waking up
you&#39;re coming out of sleep into the
waking state but you&#39;re kind of in that
drowsy half awake half asleep state but
you&#39;re rested at that juncture the
junction between dream and sleep and
waking when you&#39;re relaxed intend to
know something ask to see something ask
to have a problem solved you will be
stunned at how accurate you will become
in getting that information and also if
it&#39;s something on the order of
contacting the ETS go into it and see
them and invite them into that space
that deep consciousness field and you
will have contact
I will tell many people and it sounds
unbelievable that the number one way
that interstellar genuine interstellar
civilizations have had conned
tact with humans is in the lucid dream
state and in these subtle states of
consciousness either in meditation or
going in and out of sleep why is that
it&#39;s because our defenses are down and
we&#39;re open and we&#39;re able to relate to
the reality of civilizations that live
in a transdimensional universe now there
are other techniques I mean I there&#39;s I
don&#39;t know how to do this I didn&#39;t go to
this kind of tradition but there&#39;s
something called the Royce of crucians
and there was a man who was a lockheed
engineer Lockheed skunkworks actually
who was a one of our witnesses and he a
lot of this gets to be rather strangely
transactional you know when these
military guys will come to me and
they&#39;ll share this one of their accounts
and they know I want to hear that but
they&#39;re really wanting to pick my brain
and this guy had been practicing to do
astral projection or the the subtle body
of light travels and the Rosicrucians
apparently have techniques that
facilitate that I haven&#39;t done the
course but and he was due practicing and
practicing and practicing and trying too
hard finally his teacher says look you
know how to do this and you&#39;re ready you
can just now just do it relax and just
let yourself know you can do it so he
went home laid on his bed did whatever
techniques they were being taught and he
went straight out of his body up through
the ceiling of his house into the
atmosphere way up above the earth and
could see the house and every total
out-of-body experience and then slammed
went right into the side of an ET craft
and it was interesting because he said
that he could see within it the craft
there were I think four ETS at control
panels and he said what was strange is
that he as he hit or moved into the
craft and they looked at him like my god
why don&#39;t you watch where you&#39;re going
it was a transdimensional interstellar
faux pas not rude
I&#39;m didn&#39;t even knock and know this is
an absolute true story and you get and
he says why is it that my astral body of
light the subtle body could have moved
the spacecraft I said because the sate
is a spacecraft was in the Earth&#39;s
atmosphere not visible to the naked eye
shifted beyond the speed of light quote
D materialized in the near astral get it
and that&#39;s the form matter goes to at a
certain resonant frequency it goes to
the resonant frequency very close to
your astral body which is what you&#39;re
flying around in in and a lucid dream is
this connecting some dots for folks yeah
some people are man aha moments they
should be now and so this gentleman said
to me oh that explains it I said yes
because the density of your astral body
was very similar to the density of that
spacecraft when it is in the shifted
into and that&#39;s how you could interact
with it if it were solid and
materialized there would have been
hardens and it wouldn&#39;t that you just
gone straight through the skin of it if
it if it enough but because a similar
resonant field force field energy field
can will interact with one of similar
but if it&#39;s not similar they don&#39;t
interact at all does it make sense this
also explains how interstellar vehicles
can look like they&#39;re fully materialized
but the angular momentum and spin of of
it of it&#39;s not d materialized it&#39;s it&#39;s
mostly in this dimension but it can go
straight through a mountain or straight
to the ocean you&#39;ve heard accounts of
this right all of you have well this is
normally how they operate they can
operate like this even when they fully
visible and the reason for that is
because there are just a little bit out
of resonant
field sink with this dimension and so no
atom touches any other atom and it slips
right through remember if you were to
take your entire body and this is a
scientific fact you can look it up and
take out all the quote empty space which
by the way ends at empty it&#39;s an energy
field but you took all the matter and
collapse the space out of it your entire
body would fit on the tip of a needle a
tip of a pin
that&#39;s that speck that&#39;s all you are in
terms of solid matter the rest of you is
of something else so that&#39;s why Rishi&#39;s
and Yogi&#39;s if they go into a state of
consciousness can alter their conscious
bioelectric field and walk through that
wall
I&#39;m understand I&#39;m describing these
profound cities for you you following
this be with me for a moment so when an
interstellar vehicle is approaching it
can be shifted completely out of 3d and
not be visible with the naked eye or
partially in this dimension or
completely in this dimension but still
shifted enough that it could go straight
into the earth or through a mountain and
not touch a single atom or molecule of
the mountain or the earth
this explains thousands hundreds of
thousands of sightings and phenomenon
that people can&#39;t figure out we
understand how it works now you do so
when you&#39;re out under the stars or even
out under the daytime and you see some
unusual thing like this happen now you
understand how it happened things that
look like magic magic is only something
that hasn&#39;t been explained yet and
understood yet and don&#39;t forget our cell
phones would look completely like magic
to Thomas Jefferson and in Salem
Massachusetts you would be burned at the
stake as a witch for having a flashlight
because it would all look like science
magic these civilizations are ten to the
six to ten to the eighth the hundreds of
thousands to tens of millions of years
depends on the civilization more
developed than we are
so imagine where we might be in half a
million years
because if you extrapolate the last 150
years and go forward without suppression
of Technology where might we be we will
be in a society where the primary
sciences are centered in consciousness
and thought that then extends into these
other dimensions and 3d space-time
that&#39;s where we&#39;re headed and we&#39;re the
pioneer group to establish that on earth
that&#39;s what all of you are doing all of
you are doing that
so this Lockheed guy was going Wow now
it makes sense I never understood why
that spacecraft was moved when I hit it
because I know I was in my subtle astral
body but he hurry was a Lockheed
engineer he didn&#39;t understand the
physics because his highly compartment
at Lockheed so I actually helped teach
this to pay it&#39;s a physicist and
scientists who actually work in these
skiffs saccs kiff secure communication
intelligence facility and some of the
most brilliant engineers I know who work
on these projects don&#39;t know this
information they don&#39;t know the
conscious and transdimensional
underpinnings of what they&#39;re doing in
their lab yeah it is and that&#39;s why they
you know often kill people accidentally
they don&#39;t understand what they&#39;re doing
this is why you know this new energy
effort I really need to be the chief
technologists and scientists as well
strategists for it because I&#39;m not
trying to blow my own whistle here but
there are very few people who are in the
public and who lived to tell the tale
who have this a granular level of what
the technology is so you know hopefully
I can help advise these groups these
billion-dollar funds that are moving
into developing free energy because
they&#39;re most likely going to fail
because they&#39;ve they don&#39;t really
understand what they&#39;re dealing with yet
either who their adversaries are or even
what Sciences really are about at the
level of this granular conscious
transdimensional technology and when
you&#39;re going to do remote viewing do the
remote viewing understanding that all of
these dimensions I&#39;m talking
out or in each of you all the time right
now it&#39;s operative so you can you know
you can walk and chew gum so I tell
people around in the stars where we we
can walk and chew gum so why can&#39;t we
have our eyes open and on channel one is
in our eyes our material eyes our
channel one is our mind and our mind is
processing and scene our consciousness
is sensing let&#39;s go deep into channel
one even with our eyes open and then on
channel two might be our eyes in Channel
three might be our astral body sensing
in Channel four so we can have a
multi-channel operation
multi-dimensional perceptual ability
that we develop and the way you develop
it is becoming adept in the science of
consciousness deep meditation practice
and these remote viewing techniques is
this helpful or confusing very helpful
all right
good so that&#39;s what I want to wanted to
share in this in this first section now
I want to just do a quick couple of
exercises and you can do this at home
the one I&#39;m going to describe and not do
because you can&#39;t do it in a crowd this
big but if you&#39;re in a group of three or
four people you know get a box or a
basket like this and one person goes out
of the room and puts any object in it
it&#39;s pretend that&#39;s in there I don&#39;t
have a box up here and the others have
no idea and then you go into a group
meditation together and you go into the
group meditation using the ease of the
breathing technique or the mantra or
both or whatever fires your rockets and
let me make an editorial comment I am
completely unattached to the techniques
I&#39;m sharing with you there are 7.2
billion people on earth the hub of the
will of life is a singularity but there
are 7.2 spokes into the hub and each of
you are unique one-of-a-kind creations
which means that something that works
for her may not work for him that might
not work for her okay and so I&#39;m sharing
what I know can be
used by a lot of people if you have
other things that work I&#39;m not at all
offended and I have no I&#39;m not at all
defensive about it you know the as
George Santayana said fanaticism
consists of redoubling your effort when
you&#39;ve forgotten your goal so a lot of
people who are in these different
organizations and spiritual
organizations and trips become very
chauvinistic and bombastic about what
they&#39;re doing and my god is better than
your God in religion but in spiritual
organizations my approach is better than
yours in reality let&#39;s be honest there&#39;s
a place for all of it but you&#39;ll love
that quote from George Santayana
fanaticism consists of redoubling your
effort when you forgotten your goal
what&#39;s the goal of this is to get to the
hub of our quiet state of mind and I
knew a woman a medical doctor here in LA
who was on one of our early contact
teams she got into that Samadhi state
playing the harp the tones of the harp
and she played in sari and she would
absolutely get into that state of
consciousness so I am completely without
judgement about that I&#39;m just sharing
with you when I can in a weekend which
by the way is about but a one-year
course in advance transcendent
meditation and and Buddhists breathing
meditation if you&#39;re on the page with me
but you can you can do it any way you
want but just do it whatever works well
so you sit in meditation now here are
the steps to it step one if you&#39;re going
to not just do it on the fly instantly
you go into this quiet state of
meditation
and forget about targeting what your
remote viewing just stick with the
process of experiencing the awake mind
and do the meditation technique and when
you&#39;re in a deep quiet state instead of
guessing what is in the box just let
your mind rest on it and ask to know
what it is you might see it you might
get the word for it you may get an
aspect of it the key thing is to not
intellectualize it or have the
you start just guessing like some kind
of parlor trick or a kindergarten game
and that&#39;s what most people do so you
have to kind of be brutally honest with
yourself am i sensing this or I&#39;m just
guessing now initially you may not know
you&#39;re going because your mind may start
pulling in all sorts of things the other
thing to understand is that let&#39;s say I
put this object in a box it&#39;s metallic
it rings somebody may think I put a
tambourine in there when they&#39;re getting
close other people knowing that it&#39;s a
spiritual tool is a type bit in prayer
Bowl will turn it into some crystal that
ringing like crystalline other people
who will see the gold and think it&#39;s a
gold watch so what the mind does here&#39;s
the trick and this is getting and this
is the real art and science of this when
you begin to sense something you will
begin to get something that is an
accurate objectively true remote-view
data point and then the mind will start
doing the monkey mind thing and leapfrog
ahead of the process of just sensing and
knowing what it is and filling in the
brain blanks from your memory store how
do you distinguish and discern the
difference practice practice practice
practice because the more you practice
it the more you&#39;re gonna realize when
you&#39;re doing that and when you&#39;re not
and I will say this if you do this often
enough this technique I just described
with a box or something else where you
don&#39;t know what it is and you do it back
and forth in an hour if you take 10 or
15 minutes each time in there four
people each person can have a turn being
the person who knows and the others two
people who don&#39;t know and you do this
over and over and over and over again
you&#39;ll begin to know what it feels like
in your heart and your gut when it&#39;s an
accurate perception I call it a hit when
you get a hit that&#39;s right and you&#39;ll
know what it feels like when
it was just something that your mind
began to confabulate and makeup but in
order to develop this remote viewing
capability you really have to practice
it in an iterative over and over but
also be brutally honest with yourself
and you have to be able to target things
that are objectively verifiable don&#39;t
say let&#39;s go target what&#39;s underneath
the surface of Mars because unless you
can fly there in a spacecraft
there&#39;s no way to objectively prove
what&#39;s there or not you see what I&#39;m
saying to do that you need to do
practical exercises and that&#39;s one does
that make sense okay so step one is sit
quietly go into the meditative state
when you&#39;re deeply relaxed then intend
to no intend to know Allah and affirm
that you can know cause the mind is
omnipresent including wherever it is
you&#39;re wanting to Remote View its
omnipresent and then allow it to just
unfold and flow through and often it&#39;ll
come in a flash the most accurate ones
it just comes you you know it&#39;s a
knowingness
it&#39;s a knowingness and so as you
practice that you&#39;ll get more and more
accurate and then if you find at some
point you&#39;re distracted in the remote
viewing process just stop it
don&#39;t try to remote view the object
return to something blissful like
watching the breath or repeating them
that the the melody of the mantra and
relaxing and breathing and relaxing and
breathing and then when you&#39;re centered
again and quiet then go back to
intending quietly gently to know does
this make sense or lay down and just
relax after you&#39;ve said I want to know
this relax and just let yourself drift
and dream and boom it pop in does that
make sense it&#39;s in that deeply relaxed
unint
that&#39;s accurate at remote viewing and
intuition okay that&#39;s really key to this
very key and it that&#39;s hard close in the
West where you know
everything is brute force willpower you
know clobbering in when your nature is
to be conquered and our minds are to be
tamed less we have a waiver thought and
masturbate or something I mean it&#39;s just
you know I&#39;m sorry but you know it&#39;s
like the whole approach is ridiculous I
know I&#39;m an outrageous person and I
apologize we&#39;re human enjoy your
humanity while it yield while it lasts
I always tell people who are so ascetic
they loathe having a physical body I
said well go take a rock and kill
yourself and go to another dimension
enjoy the body enjoy your food and enjoy
sex and joy okay anyways I have a whole
philosophy of this which religiosity
would be appalled to hear but although
I&#39;ve had some great conversations about
it with some of the Vatican folks and
they 100% agree actually I live an
interesting life
so those are the techniques that is the
technique to use that is the central
approach now you can then apply it in a
million ways you can do all kinds of
things another one that&#39;s wonderful and
this technique works very well you go
into the quiet meditative state very
deep but before you begin your your
wanting to feel the emotion and you have
at least three or four people five ten
however many it is if there are a lot of
people you can get to people to be
transmitters and if it&#39;s a small group
one person and I call this has been
called a guy at NASA actually turned me
on to this 25 years ago 20 years ago and
it&#39;s called emotive listening and so you
sit quietly and a
somebody goes out of the room if with
another person if there are two people
or just stays in the room and decides on
an emotion that they&#39;re going to be
transmitting and a scenario for example
the joy of a baby being born the birth
of a new child I&#39;m a pop to my mic
because we just had a new baby all I did
and my daughter did huh
although I have friends my age still
having children boy if they had children
like her for the young so we uh and what
would the way you do this is that the
transmitters go into this deep quiet
mind and transmit from this quiet state
and the receivers receive the emotion
and the scenario so this is actually
easier than remote viewing in an I&#39;m an
object because it has the emotional
component and emotions are very powerful
especially with humans right and so as
you go in and this this then is
something where instead of an inanimate
augment estate and the transmitters are
equally responsible for being in a deep
and expanded state and then transmitting
from there the emotion and what the
scenario is
and then the receivers are there to
receive the feeling and also the
scenario two components and the emotion
helps open up the scenario it&#39;s amazing
when I do these experiments with groups
of people the concordance is very high
the numbers of people who will get the
right emotion and the correct scenario
is unbelievably high and it&#39;s very
effective and that&#39;s much closer to what
we&#39;re doing when we&#39;re communicating
with interstellar extra tress
stro life-forms does that make sense
because we&#39;re dealing with human being
yo why not human beings we&#39;re dealing
with people who are conscious who have
emotions and who have thought and are
showing you a scenario where they are
they may be wanting to tell you what
time they&#39;re coming and where and so you
want to receive that all the very major
ce-5 have had a precognitive lucid dream
or meditation guidance to win and where
a day or week or hours beforehand so you
can do this pre cognitively as well but
by doing this exercise with your contact
team four or five six people or your
partner you sharpen that ability to
sense the feeling and the scenario and
you just go back and forth taking turns
one being the transmitter the other
being the receiver one being the
receiver with the other transmitter this
does make sense I want to be real clear
on what that technique is and it&#39;s very
powerful and it&#39;s a great way of
sharpening that skillset so the one
technique putting something in a box
now there&#39;s another one now if you want
we can do it together what time is it
getting to be three oh my why don&#39;t we
do it after the break all right so what
we&#39;ll do is I&#39;m gonna take the we&#39;ll do
a type it into prayer bowl and I&#39;ll take
you through the breathing or thing and
we&#39;ll then we&#39;ll do a remote viewing of
a place and then we&#39;ll see how much of
it you get alright great well let&#39;s take
a break for about 20 minutes come back
at 3:00 3:30
