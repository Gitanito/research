 Not published during "the darkest days of the Second World War."  The journal in its first phase (1937-1939) is exemplary of the occult interests of the English literary classes between the wars, with the exception of its disdain for practical magic, spiritualism, and popular occultism and astrology and its strong concentration in its early days on Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy.  It was revived after the War under Heaver, a Christian socialist and adherent of British Israel, and turned more generally to the occult with an admixture of literature and politics.  The journal originally concentrated on what it thought were the remnants of the teachings of the great initiatory paths (druidism, Buddhism, the Arthurian stories and the Holy Grail, etc.) and displayed a marked interest in Baha'i and AMORC, as well.  It featured current events in occult circles, book reviews, and articles on reincarnation, the Apocalypse, etheric earth, the "Horoscope of Annie Besant," the zodiac, Swedenborg, the sphinx, eurythmy [sic], graphology, etc.  There were contributions by Paul Brunton, Bernard William Bromage, H. Spencer Lewis, Cyril Scott, Henry Miller, Israel Regardie, Wellesley Tudor Pole, Lord Dunsany, Eleanor Roosevelt, Lord Alfred Douglas, and Alan W. Watts, Willi Sucher ("John W. Seeker"),  et al., and by prominent Anthroposophists, many originally German-speaking, like Norbert Glas, Alfred Heidenreich, G.S. Francis, Eugen and Mrs. L. Kolisko, and Eleanor C. Merry (1873-1956), the writer, poet and painter who explored the mysteries of the "Celtic Soul."
