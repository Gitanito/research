  		        Experience Description:   

  I was walking in a dark tunnel.  I could see light at the other end of the tunnel.  A man walked towards me, put his hand on my head and told me that I had to turn back because it wasn't my time.

  A woman in the hospital told me God spoke to me.   I kept asking why God was calling me Jesus, because my name wasn't Jesus.  God said I wouldn't understand until it was time.  
  
Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 1972  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Uncertain         asthma attack.   Other: I don't remember.  I didn't understand what happened.  
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Both pleasant AND distressing  

Did you feel separated from your body?      No

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        Less consciousness and alertness than normal   

  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         I don't understand the question.  I don't remember any sense of taste, touch, or smell.  I just remember seeing and hearing.  My head and body felt warm when the man touched my head.  These answers are the reason why I'm saying that I had Less consciousness and alertness than normal.  I'm a morning person.  I can usually see very clearly, because it's daylight.  The tunnel was dark and I couldn't see anything but a light at the end of it and the shape of a man approaching me.  
  
Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         No     

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       The light was so bright that I had to look away.  When the man was touching my head. I had to look down, because the light over his head was the same bright light.  
  
Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      same.

  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Fear of darkness. In real life, there was a storm sewer behind our house.  It was one of those large diameter concrete sewers that a kid could walk through.  In real life, if you walked through that storm drain, you could see light at the end of the tunnel where there was a stormgrate letting light in.  I was always afraid to walk through that tunnel, because it was dark, the bottom of that storm drain was slimy and there were crayfish that would pinch your toes.  I was afraid when I first started walking through the dark tunnel of my NDE even though there was light at the end of the tunnel.  I was afraid when I saw the man walking towards me.  The light was so bright, I had to look away.  I wasn't afraid when he touched my head.  When he told me I had to turn back, I started crying, because I wanted to stay with him.  I was sad, because I couldn't stay.
