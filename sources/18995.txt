we&#39;re gonna go through the whole
concepts of what the phenomena are
plural dealing with interstellar
civilizations coming into this dimension
and it runs the gamut consciousness
remote viewing sound smells objects that
are materialized light tonality earth
interfaces for example the earth
actually being recruited to create
phenomena that is extraterrestrial
that&#39;s a very unbelievable way that the
ETS can interface with natural forces
etc and so on and so forth it&#39;s actually
almost an infinite array of types of
manifestations of extraterrestrial
interface with this dimension earth
humans space-time and our consciousness
which is transdimensional coming in
there was a woman who very appropriately
asked me about the question of whether
something&#39;s from another dimension or if
his extraterrestrial and I addressed
this in LA on Sunday last Sunday
most people will conflate everything
that&#39;s unusual as et if they believe in
ETS
other people who don&#39;t know about ETS
might have an extraterrestrial event
happen and assume it&#39;s something from
the afterlife or another dimension or
the angelic realm and so the old saying
the world is as you are there&#39;s a need
for discernment here so if you take all
the as they call it strange phenomenon I
don&#39;t like the word paranormal because
it&#39;s not para to me
this is normal but take all this unusual
phenomenon and put it in this complete
set and then you take the
extraterrestrial phenomena which can be
fully materialized 3d and very
understandable to linear or materialists
and it then overlaps partially into this
transdimensional phenomenon yeah what
they need me here are sirens the
emergency doctor goes home so if you
have understand these two sets and then
looking at the overlapping subsets where
they overlap this is makes sense
there is found amount of overlap why
because if you are interstellar as I
said last night your transdimensional
but not everything that is
interdimensional or transdimensional is
extra-terrestrial got it so you could
have some phenomena that happen that&#39;s
purely from another dimension spirit
world nature diva&#39;s energies your
grandmother trying to contact you
knocking over a saucer what&#39;s been
called poltergeist
so there are phenomena that that can
occur that belonged to intelligent
beings from other dimensions or embedded
within the whole cosmology of everything
beyond the speed of light and electrons
what I wrote about 1995 the crossing
point of light when you go through that
crossing point of lights like the sound
barrier but now we&#39;re talking with a
light barrier and you&#39;re in this phase
shift into these other dimensions well
obviously if these are interstellar
civilizations they are both and they&#39;re
there they have physical bodies and
spacecraft and they&#39;re from planets and
star systems they have the material what
we would call material 3d component but
they&#39;ve also mastered the sciences of
justice and transdimensional physics
that allow them to interface and travel
it beyond the speed of light and they
can emerge in and out of this these
other dimensions now how high are far
into these other dimensions can they go
that&#39;s dependent on the level of
consciousness of the aggregate leading
force on that planet what do I mean by
that well the aggregate consciousness of
earth is still alas violent destructive
separate so look at our technologies
violent destructive separate we burn
things fossil fuels we blow up we split
the atom to run basically a steam engine
generator from the 1800s that&#39;s all a
nuclear power plant is right most people
don&#39;t know that they think that the top
nuclear power plants are getting nuclear
power going straight to electricity
because people don&#39;t understand what
electricity is actually all in a nuclear
power plant is is that is heating water
turning a turbine like in the 1800s to
create electrons flowing down the power
line that&#39;s all it is so it&#39;s very
primitive except it creates unbelievable
ask the people about Fukushima it
creates unbelievable damage to all
living creatures and all we&#39;re doing is
boiling water that&#39;s it that&#39;s all the
nuclear power plant is so all the the
entire operating system of the planet is
life destroying cancer inducing violent
you&#39;re a car isn&#39;t controlled explosion
of this noxious carcinogenic stuff
called gasoline but the technology is
really concomitant it&#39;s with its
embedded within the state of
consciousness of the aggregate awareness
of the plan
otherwise about 50 years into the fossil
fuel era we would have had Tesla&#39;s stuff
right so this is what why I keep saying
you know primacy is with consciousness
but it has very practical real-world
implications of the consciousness behind
any technology so let&#39;s take that
example because you can all relate to
what I just said you live on planet
Earth you know the problems you know
hopefully you&#39;re not living in a cave
mmm like Dick Cheney no God sorry I said
that so what there is no pollution
there&#39;s no global warming when all is
well with the world while we drive it
over a cliff there&#39;s that mindset
so at a certain point you then think
well if a civilization is has developed
to where we&#39;ll be in some thousands of
years where everyone born on the planet
and this is where we&#39;re headed at birth
will be in cosmic consciousness
experiencing Samadhi because the
epigenetic field and programming that
gets passed on within one generation or
actually one progeny to another will be
heightened then the technologies that we
will be using will be in concert with
that level of enlightenment up to and
including the celestial level so the
civilizations that are already in a
state of enlightenment I&#39;m not saying
all of them are but if they&#39;re at that
level of actualization and we&#39;re the
entire planet or most of the beings on
the planet in that higher state of
consciousness their technologies are
based from that level of consciousness
because that&#39;s what they&#39;re able to not
only explore but maintain as a group as
a civilization and culture but also
scientifically manifest but even the
most elementary interstellar
transdimensional civilization that can
go from one star system to another
has to go beyond the speed of light so
they understand the crossing point of
light and therefore they have to
understand these other dimensions and
the primacy of consciousness and that&#39;s
why any of them that are here that are
not stagecraft by the covert government
using Holograms and chemicals and
electromagnetic warfare systems and
man-made anti-gravity things and
man-made little creatures that look like
aliens which is a big part of what&#39;s
reported in the UFO subculture those
civilizations that are that are the
genuine et ones yeah oh they&#39;re
technologies are going to be amazingly
embedded within other dimensions as well
and so if they do if they fully
materialized even then you&#39;re going to
feel the consciousness of that craft in
their occupants you&#39;re gonna feel it
you&#39;re gonna sense it those of you who
had how many people had a close enough
encounter with an object where you could
feel the intent and the consciousness of
the occupants and just curious yes and
that is that is a legitimate experience
because you know it&#39;s almost like when
my dog Rosie I described earlier loved
her and it&#39;ll she&#39;ll be way out in the
meadow and I&#39;ll look out a window and
just look at her she feels me and looks
and walks on right to my eyes she can
feel you you see but imagine if you had
technologies that can do that so they do
however with that said there are things
that happen events phenomena that happen
that are from other dimensions that are
an extraterrestrial that are easily
confusable with the et phenomenon
because there&#39;s this subset overlap and
this is where discerning that comes into
play and sometimes you just don&#39;t know
you have to put you have to be an
agnostic about and say I don&#39;t know if
that was et or from another dimension or
you know et using technology or
own consciousness that is very anchored
in these other deeper dimensions of
thought
astral fields etc and sometimes you just
don&#39;t know but you need to know that
there&#39;s a differential that you have yet
a distinction you have to go through
I like liken this to a doctor who is a
you know not a very good one who only
knows one diagnosis for chest pain
there&#39;s a heart attack well actually it
could be a dissecting thoracic aneurysm
it could be pleurisy it could be an old
sir that&#39;s radiating up into the chest
it could be there&#39;s like a hundred and
fifteen things and the differential
diagnosis for chest pain so an unskilled
physician would call everyone with chest
pain had a heart attack a skilled
physician would have the differential
diagnosis and discernment to run through
the differential do the examinations and
tests and discover exactly what it is so
you take an analogy unfortunately in the
UFO subculture and in the new-age
community there&#39;s a lacking in
discernment where everything is just the
same thing in a sense yes everything is
conscious in blah blah blah but you know
you don&#39;t pluck out your eyeball as easy
as you cut your fingernails that&#39;s from
a Persian saying the reality is in the
realm of the relative discernment is
essential and if you&#39;re going to be an
ambassador from this earth to those
civilizations you need to at least know
what the differential diagnosis what the
items are in it which is why I&#39;m going
through this so I wrote a paper about
the crossing point of light and then
another one that&#39;s called
extraterrestrial intelligence and the
new cosmology which very few people have
read because again no one reads but the
ones who have will go yes well this
begins to put all this together and the
dimensions that are attainable by an
extraterrestrial civilization if they
are at the level of where we will be
five hundred thousand years from now
where every man woman and child on earth
will be in a state of an
in God consciousness and perhaps even
unity consciousness where they actually
perceive everything is consciousness
those civilizations that are at that
level their technologies can interface
in a way that could be easily confused
with the angelic realm the afterlife
the celestial until of course they fully
materialized obviously in history many
people have had contact with
extraterrestrials that are manifest in a
way that&#39;s interdimensional and they
will think it&#39;s not et but an ancestor
at the same token there are people today
who will have an interaction with a
covert programs psychotronic weapon
electronic weapon systems that induce
images or a program life form one of
these robotic creatures and an ET craft
that will think of CT and it&#39;s man-made
or they&#39;ll have an interaction with
something a phenomenon or a being from
another dimension
and think it&#39;s extraterrestrial so this
creates an enormous amount of
cosmological confusion which I&#39;m trying
to clarify in the first 10 or 15 minutes
so that when we start showing some of
this you&#39;ll have a foundation for this
for an understanding but when you go out
with your team out under the stars
you&#39;ll really begin to think that is it
this is it extraterrestrial is a covert
human military or is it from another
dimension and which dimension and how
far it was interesting when I was at the
Vatican with Monsignor Balducci who was
the senior theologian to the Pope John
Paul he was actually a demonologist kind
of creepy but a really nice man and I
was headed
look my thing I was going I&#39;m okay but
but very very very genuine a spiritual
man and I was that is his apartment
overlooking st. Peter&#39;s Basilica and all
this and Paula Harris and I did an
interview with him which you know
hopefully we need a good Italian
translator to translate all of it but he
said to me yo his issue came up and he
says oh yes I hear this all the time
he says neither Angels nor demons need
flying saucers it was so simple and so
obvious
I said yes you&#39;re absolutely right and
then we started talking about all the
here that the the kind of cult mythology
that&#39;s built up in the UFO subculture in
the New Age subculture that&#39;s been
advanced by the disinformation and
disinformation Nexus of the CIA
Hollywood and the mainstream media and
video games and UFO conferences of oh
you know let&#39;s confuse them even more
and stagecraft
all these confusing things that are
actually man-made military operations
and most people are fooled by them so
we&#39;re trying to go out and make contact
but I&#39;m just saying you have to be sure
you understand what that feels and looks
like and also know and have a healthy
dose of critical skepticism and the true
word is skeptic not a debunker but
questioning truly questioning is it this
is it this is it this is it man-made is
it et or is it from another dimension or
just a total misapprehension of
something prosaic ordinary that that
discernment is really key so when we
talk about extraterrestrial intelligence
and these other dimensions we have to
begin to entertain the idea first of all
almost any way that they would manifest
is going to look like magic to us and
it&#39;s very easy to confuse that with
something from another dimension that
isn&#39;t et so you just accept that that&#39;s
the case but there is a distinct
learning curve that happens as you go
out and begin to make contact where you
can clearly discern the energy of a
human militarized decoy it&#39;s very
obvious it&#39;s invasive if you see the
object up close it&#39;s got seams parts for
true princes rivets and stuff like this
isn&#39;t not et then at a distance you may
not know but if there is a component of
invasiveness where it is inducing fear
it is almost certainly man-made but then
you get into this realm where you&#39;re
sitting there in deep meditation and
multiple phenomena can start to come in
not manmade extraterrestrial this
transdimensional that appears as a
sphere floats through the group people
are in a deep state of consciousness
suddenly they hear an ancient Native
American that was on that spot five
thousand years ago because you&#39;re in a
deep state of consciousness in the
Akashic record is bleeding through and
then on top of that you have events that
are happening from another dimension
parallel dimensions from the afterlife
or from the astral worlds and all of
that can be happening in the same
evening get it so one of the things I&#39;ve
tried to do when I take people out is to
sort of be a Sherpa a guide through that
wilderness and sometimes I&#39;ll just say I
don&#39;t know what it was I&#39;m not sure if
it was extraterrestrial or something
from another dimension because it is
there&#39;s not enough data or it was too
vague or it&#39;s almost identical in this
expression so sometimes you remain an
agnostic even when it&#39;s happening
been doing this since I was 18 which is
a couple years ago I I think that&#39;s
that&#39;s kind of how I want to introduce
this because once we get into the
understanding of that then we can
understand these things now what are
these little things up here there are
they&#39;re little they&#39;re instead of a
random number generator
this is a Trifield meter you can get
them I recommend you special order and
ask the company to get one that has the
magnetic field on 0 to 3 range and if it
it picks up the Delta or the change in
the magnetic field so electromagnetic
systems like that speaker and it&#39;ll it
just squeals when it&#39;s doing something
electromagnetic that&#39;s man-made if
you&#39;re out in the wilderness and you&#39;re
not you don&#39;t have it beside a boombox
or something or a car it
good grief it really ought to be quiet
once you turn the rheostat back and zero
it see so if you&#39;ve zeroed it because
that&#39;s you turn a knob where it becomes
silent and is at the point of the
baseline magnetic field of the earth
does that make sense if then there&#39;s a
perturbation in it a change in the
magnetic field you should have a heads
up because in the magnetic field
torsion change spinning very often maybe
et not always there very often
and you may not see anything but this
starts making sounds that is not even
programmed to do for example when we
were in Portugal in September it
actually began to contact an ET that was
and it was going through like a
conversation that went on for a very
long time
and this has happened hundreds and
hundreds of times now you&#39;d say well
this is really I mean it&#39;s a 150 $200
electronic measuring thing but remember
random number generator is just a random
number generator how does it interface
with consciousness so we&#39;ve asked the
ETS to interface by the way can someone
turn down the temperature it&#39;s like 89
degrees in here it&#39;s right there
staffers wake up but thank you
so so this is a Trifield meter as I said
yep
model 100x II so this model 100 XC so
it&#39;s a it&#39;s just a very simple but it&#39;s
very sensitive now the this C City app
that you have on your phone your smart
phones those are you have it actually
causes your phone to become a magnetic
field meter by using its magnetic
compass but it&#39;s not as accurate and
sensitive as this is this is a much
better instrument so when this is
sitting and you&#39;re up in the wilderness
and there&#39;s nothing near it that&#39;s
electromagnetic and it starts lighting
up and talking it&#39;s heads up and why
because they may not in name it may not
be safe for them to completely
materialize in their spacecraft and have
bagels and lox with you but they can
communicate through this and they do and
it goes on sometimes for hours hours
often when we have a merging experience
where there&#39;ll be an ET that will begin
to shimmer you just see it with your
soft eyes you know soft eyes are so it&#39;s
like when you&#39;re daydreaming and you&#39;re
just staring into infinity and you&#39;re
just aware of the energies around you
and you&#39;ll begin to see a scintillating
form now it could be a ghost or your
grandma but often if you&#39;re making doing
these contact protocols it&#39;ll be an ET
that&#39;s not materialized and they will
walk into the group and as they go
around these will go off to each person
they go to we&#39;ve seen this zone but
unbelievable you can&#39;t able to forget
Arecibo we&#39;ve already done it the SETI
project now it doesn&#39;t conform to their
linear understanding of reality but it&#39;s
it&#39;s equally profound more profound
actually than anything will ever come
into the city project they will actually
do this in different tonalities even
though this isn&#39;t program to do it
they&#39;ll alter the circuitry so it&#39;ll eat
some will sound very emotional some will
be mathematical and intellectual so
different species will check in and out
of this thing
and almost everyone who&#39;s gone with me
out for a week has witnessed this and
it&#39;s a absolutely unbelievable
phenomenon so that&#39;s one now this is
just a radar detector we call him Walter
because somebody named Walter gave it to
us so Walter we&#39;ve intended with
consciousness to be a contact point for
the sum of the et species of which there
are thousands millions and but there are
a few that are cleared to deal with
earth poser is we&#39;ll get into this with
cosmic clearance on the et side not the
human and this is interesting cuz when
this will go off sometimes again in a
remote area where there&#39;s no microwave
or police cars anywhere near when it
does beep beep it&#39;s a it&#39;s in the
education yes won&#39;t be asking a question
when it goes beep-beep-beep which it
won&#39;t do if it hits a microwave tower or
a police car just goes yeah those of you
have radar detectors you know what they
do that&#39;s when it&#39;s it says we are here
and there are different codes that we&#39;ve
gone back and forth with the ETS on to
use this now you can make up your own
system with any device because they can
program it with your consciousness
that&#39;s what you can do with random
number generators and that atom Curie is
doing with the lamps that light up so
basically you can you can get in one of
these and start the cg5 contacts and
then asking and create your own
nomenclature ok your own language
understand it&#39;s very simple isn&#39;t it&#39;s
almost it&#39;s simple but it&#39;s elegant and
it works which is why a lot of people
will really go well these things it&#39;s
really a profound this one is a little
different this is a more expensive then
you can get RadioShack or online this
radar detector for very little that&#39;s
about 150 to him this is a a thunderbolt
I just went off so this picks up
lightning strikes
and a professional outdoorsman mountain
climbers both people out on the ocean
use this when a storm&#39;s approaching to
warn them of lightning bolt strikes and
that&#39;s from all its program for that
pick up the electromagnetic discharge of
a massive lightning bolt and and it will
range like one just hit a 50 miles away
40 miles away well there&#39;s no lightning
forty miles within here so what we&#39;ve
asked the ETS to do is use this as an in
my case because this is my personal one
this is a security protocol so there&#39;s
one there are several et civilizations
whose Dharma is they&#39;re sort of the
protect their path is protection of
people and this one specie is from the
star system Arcturus when they
materialize when they&#39;ve been around us
there they have the Chevron shaped craft
that are like liquid gold beautiful
golden and they&#39;re very large or lemis
amorphic huge I&#39;d look like Tiny Tim by
comparison you know eight to 12 feet
tall very mesomorphic a muscular big
tall and that they will check in and out
on this one
when there&#39;s a threat or if I&#39;m moving
so if I&#39;m hiking through the woods with
it to a spot to make contact or even
driving in a car it will go off at each
point that I change directions like a
cosmic GPS I when I make a right turn or
a left turn and go like to be and then
be but there you know you can check your
weather app there&#39;s not a lightning
storm or a rain within hundreds of miles
and this is going off now we&#39;ve talked
to the engineers at the factory if the
company makes this that&#39;s not possible
they&#39;ve said the same thing about the
magnetic field meter it is possible
because we&#39;re having electronic events
happen that are coming into this
dimension from interstellar technologies
that are consciousness actuated with us
and these just become a way of
confirming their presence and sometimes
engaging in a dialogue like in the
magnetometer
so those are tools you can use and you
can create your own we actually I&#39;m very
excited about the idea of this group it
called entanglement and Adam Curry doing
some things with random number
generators where we intend put it in the
middle of a circle where we&#39;re making
contact and ask to ETS to take it over
and start spitting out a message or a
code with it would it be cool out in the
middle of nowhere that&#39;s the next phase
we don&#39;t have that yet it&#39;s just
something we&#39;ve been discussing the last
week or so all right that&#39;s just sort of
an introduction to a few things and oh
well I was just going to start the
beginning but we can&#39;t do it do we need
to have a darker so you guys can see the
screen the problem is you know I
actually think it&#39;s more important to
people to hear my narration who are here
and also online than to see me because
there&#39;s really nothing to see I mean
you&#39;ve seen Mami&#39;s always well I mean
enough already
the other thing we have when we go out
are these now this is I don&#39;t hit
anybody this is a thousand million green
laser and it really clear Erica&#39;s way
out through the atmosphere and we put
this up you don&#39;t hit an aircraft or go
to prison we put this have never pointed
at an object or you know you wanted to
but it becomes a point where they can
get a very clear fix on our exact
location and also I&#39;ll sometimes with a
with an et optical signal and play with
it that&#39;s way up in space and it&#39;ll be
signaling back one time I could feel one
above us and I put this up and it was
about maybe a hundred feet above you
looked up and it was story and it
actually hit a partially dematerialized
or parsley materialized craft that
reflected this right back into the
center of the circle each time we&#39;ve had
amazing phenomena happen with these
lasers but you have to be careful this
is strong enough to damage your retina
and as
it certainly you don&#39;t want to hit an
aircraft helicopter or anything like
that so if you see an object far away
you&#39;re not sure what it is even if you
think you&#39;re sure you just make a circle
around it and not point at it you can
just order these online where they&#39;re
legal by Australia they&#39;re illegal
apparently the other thing we do when we
go out we have the C SETI tones and
which we&#39;ll play in a moment and these
we have you can use it loops through
your iPhone with some speakers and we
just play them and we get a little radio
and people say what channel it&#39;s an e
walkie-talkie and just send it up the
because they hear it turn the volume up
when you hear when this is our signature
tone that we send out into space I guess
the people who can&#39;t turn up the volume
it&#39;s okay everybody hear that
that&#39;s the original tone came in to a
crop circle it was of a frequency that
it blew out a beta cam for the BBC and
it was a signal that got recorded that
then was put on a loop and each time you
hear it it slowed down by half and you
hear the components almost like a
heartbeat an ultrasound listening to our
beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep
beep beep I apologize I don&#39;t know why
we don&#39;t have sound and stuff yet but
anyway that&#39;s that&#39;s what they are and
when you have these tones with your
lights and your thought it&#39;s the C city
triangle again so again tonality these
tones light and consciousness and
thought so those are the three elements
we use coordinated out under the stars
we usually open our our meeting with
when we&#39;re setting up plan these tones
putting the laser up and just connecting
with the earth and the ETS and letting
them know where we are so we&#39;re not
playing this the whole time we&#39;re
meditating it&#39;d be too distracting so we
just do it intermittently and it breaks
but it&#39;s very important to do
