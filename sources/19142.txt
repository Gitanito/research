i&#39;ve spent
10 years in marine corps four years
working with the air force as a civilian
doing experimental testing on aircraft
since uh my marine corps days i was a
pilot in the service and a fighter pilot
and fought in
world war ii after late the latter part
of world war
ii and the korean war conflict
i was at the and
went up as far as the
yalu river
i didn&#39;t start working on flight still
mirrors until about
well the year was 1954 in september
and uh well
a little later than that excuse let me
go back a little bit
after i got out of the marine corps i
took a job with the air force at
wright-patterson
doing experimental flight testing on
various different modifications and tech
orders that they had
incorporated into aircraft various
different aircraft
f-89 back then the
beef b47
f-102 in those aircraft while i was at
wright-patterson of course i was
approached by a individual that
and i i&#39;m not going to mention his name
to determine if i wanted to work in a
an area on just new creative things
okay and apparently that was a flying
disc simulator
what they had done they had selected uh
several of us and they uh reassigned me
to a link aviation which was a simulator
manufacturer
uh at that time they were building what
they call the c11b
f102 simulator b47 simulator and so
forth
and they wanted us to get the experience
before we
actually uh started work on the flying
disk simulator
which i spent 30 some years
working on so they had flying disk
simulators
to your knowledge when was the earliest
they had them in operation
i i don&#39;t think any went in operation
until the late
or early 60s around 62 or 63
my as i watched the reason why i&#39;m
saying this is because
the simulator wasn&#39;t actually functional
until around 1958
where the simulator was actually
operable the simulator that they used or
the
craft that they used to build which is a
30 meter one was the one that crashed in
arizona uh kingman arizona
uh back in 53 or 52 i think it was 53.
that&#39;s the one they use that&#39;s the first
one that they took out to the test site
it was a controlled
craft you know that the aliens wanted to
present to
our government or the usa uh
it landed about 15 miles from uh which
used to be an army air base
uh which is now defunct army base i
forget i re
i can&#39;t recall the name of it
but that particular craft there were
some problems with
number one getting it on the flatbed to
take it up
to area 51. they couldn&#39;t get it across
the dam because of the road it had to be
bars across the
you know uh the colorado river at the
time and then taken up to
uh where people go now up uh
up 93 uh
out to area 51 which was uh
just being really constructed at the
time and taken
down those dirt roads and out out to
that particular area of the test site
uh there were four uh
aliens aboard that thing and those
aliens went to los alamos
uh for
basically uh you know a
it was a sort of a test thing uh they
said it they set up the
los alamos with a particular area for
those for those guys
and they put uh certain people into
their and their with them
people that you know were
astrophysicists you know
uh just general scientists you know uh
to ask them questions uh the way the
story was told to me was
there was only one of them that would
talk to any to
to any of these scientists that they put
in the lab with them
only one of the aliens the rest wouldn&#39;t
talk to anybody or
you know even have a conversation with
them
uh you know first they thought you know
it was all
you know esp or you know
what do i want us what do i want to say
uh telepathy
so yeah mental telepathy but you know
most of that&#39;s
most sad is kind of a joke to me because
they actually speak uh uh
maybe not like we do but uh they
actually speak and
can converse you know but there was only
one
the difference between this aircraft and
or this
disc and other other discs that they had
looked at
was that it was much simpler design
in the simulator was one one big thing
different
the thing that like lazar calls the
reactor okay we didn&#39;t have a react we
had us
we had a a space and a thing that looked
like the reactor but
that wasn&#39;t the thing we operated the
simulator with
we operated with six uh
large capacitors that were charged
with uh a million volts each say there
were six million volts in those
capacitors their
largest capacitors ever built
these particular capacitors they last
for 30 minutes so you could get in there
and actually
work the controls and do what you had to
to get the aircraft or get the simulator
this operate okay so it wasn&#39;t
it wasn&#39;t that simple because
we only had 30 minutes okay and the
reason why it was designed like that
photo i showed you was
actually when it was operable it would
lift off
the ball about a certain amount of
there was a dimension there that we had
that it actually lifted up
and it could actually turn you know a
certain
certain amount of degrees left to right
or whatever but
in a simulator now you&#39;ll notice that
there are no seat belts right
and the same thing with the actual craft
no seat belts you don&#39;t need seat belts
because when you fly one of these things
upside down there&#39;s no upside down like
in a regular aircraft you have your own
gravitational field right inside
so if you&#39;re flying upside down
to you you&#39;re right side up did you ever
get inside the actual craft
i was in there for startups sure how do
you how do they
image how do they how do you look out
the windows from one of these things
actually we didn&#39;t look out any windows
there weren&#39;t any windows
the only place we had any uh visibility
at all and it was done with uh
with cameras or video type things at
that time
was in the turret and the turret section
my thing was the flight deck
and the instruments on the flight deck i
knew about the gravitational field and
what it took to
get people to you know train them to be
able to come in that thing you know
and and operate you would be sick
or disoriented in about two minutes
after getting in after it was cranked up
uh it takes it takes a lot of time
because of the area
and the smallness of it just to raise
your hand
it becomes complicated you have to be
trained trained with your mind you know
to accept what you&#39;re going to
actually feel and so there&#39;s some
perceptual distortion
there&#39;s a lot of distortion yeah yeah
seeing uh just moving about it&#39;s it&#39;s a
after a while after you get used to it
only and you and you do it it&#39;s it&#39;s
it&#39;s simple you just
you got to know where everything is you
know and you got to understand what&#39;s
going to happen
to your body it&#39;s no different than you
know accepting the
g-forces you know when you&#39;re flying a
aircraft or coming out of a dive you
know and that kind of thing it&#39;s a
it&#39;s a whole new ball game each engineer
that had anything to do with the design
was part of startup crew
you know verify all their stuff that
they put in
works like it&#39;s supposed to did
our flight crews ever take one of these
disks out into space
you know i don&#39;t know that i don&#39;t i
don&#39;t really know that i i just
i&#39;m sure they have uh
i&#39;m saying it probably took it took a
while to
train enough of the people or
sufficient time the whole big problem
with this
with the disc is that it&#39;s so exacting
in its design and so forth
and it can&#39;t be used uh say with uh it
can&#39;t be used as a
like we use aircraft today with uh
dropping bombs and
and you know having machine guns you
know in the wings and that kind of stuff
uh it&#39;s uh the design
is so exacting that you can&#39;t add
anything
you can&#39;t it&#39;s got to be it&#39;s got to be
just right
there&#39;s a there&#39;s a big problem in the
in the design
of where things are put uh
say you know that where the center of
the aircraft is and that type of thing
even the fact that we raised at three
feet
so the taller guys could get in and
stuff
the actual ship was extended uh
back to its original configuration but
actually raised we had a long period of
introduction into meeting you know say
uh an abe and
i i called him j-rod of course that&#39;s
what they called him but that wasn&#39;t his
you know i don&#39;t know if that was his
real name or not but that&#39;s the name
that the
the linguist gave him you know
so he knew j-rod you know and i i
did draw a sketch of him when he was
before i left of
him in a meeting but you know i i
provided it to some people but that was
my
my impression of what i saw how much
contact
individual contact did you have with him
oh he used to
he used to come in with teller
and some of the other guys occasionally
on
on questions that maybe we&#39;d have you
know
but uh you got to understand that
everything was
you know specific to the group if it
wasn&#39;t specific to the group
you couldn&#39;t talk about it you know so
need to know
need to know and you know speak if and
he&#39;d talk
he would talk but he&#39;d sound just like
if you spoke he&#39;d sound like you
you know he he&#39;s like one of the you
know a parrot
but but he&#39;d try and answer your
question you know
a lot of times you&#39;d have a hard time
understanding you know because
if you didn&#39;t put it on paper and
explain yourself
half the time he couldn&#39;t give you a
good a good question good answer
when you said there was a long build up
to actually meeting this person
what was the preparation like before you
actually had a chance to have personal
contact
well the preparation was uh you know
basically uh
going through first of all went to all
of the different nationalities in the
world right
just you know these whatever you know
human nationalities
yeah human nationality you know then
they got into
going into uh other forms of life you
know
even down to you know animals and that
type of thing
and the fact that uh you know this this
this j-rod had his skin was pinkish but
a little bit rough you know and that
kind of stuff not
you know not horrible looking you know
or to me he didn&#39;t look horrible looking
some of the guys you know that was in
the particular
groups that i was in they never even
made it you know as far as i was
concerned
you know when they gave you the
psychological question you know i just
answered them the way i felt and i had
no problem
you know and that&#39;s what they wanted to
know
you know if you&#39;d become uh
like you know hey here&#39;s an alien he&#39;s
he&#39;s from here and i don&#39;t know what
those kind of things you know
but it never bothers me you know it
didn&#39;t didn&#39;t mount too much
so what kind do you know what kind of
scientific advice he would give the
the crew that was building or back
engineering these
basically it was only engineering advice
or science advice
you know say for example i perform the
calculation
and there&#39;s a i spoke of a
book that it&#39;s not a book it&#39;s a
big assembly of
various different divisions of uh
on gravitational technology okay
and uh
the the key element in there all the
information wasn&#39;t there
because even our guys our people that
were the top mathematicians and stuff
couldn&#39;t figure some of this stuff out
so we would take it and you know we&#39;d
have to with each design you know
there&#39;s a requirement
requirement for calculations and we&#39;d
have to prove
by calculations you know that this
thing&#39;s going to operate
no different than anything else we do
and sometimes you
get into a spot where you try and try
and try and even if you use the formulas
to
come up with this thing that they&#39;d
provide you it wouldn&#39;t work
and that&#39;s where he&#39;d come in you know
tell him to look at this and see what we
did wrong
so you really never knew how many we had
the last
uh 40 years or so or 60 years
uh maybe there&#39;s uh
i&#39;d say 40 years anyway not counting the
simulators i&#39;m talking about actual
craft there&#39;s probably
maybe two or three dozen
various different sizes that we&#39;ve built
or that we have that we built okay
i don&#39;t know much about the ones that
you know that they brought here
i know about that one out of kingman but
that&#39;s about it
and i know the company that hauled it
out of there and
who&#39;s out here now a couple different
versions that they use one was a
chemical version
one was a solid version and i don&#39;t even
know the chemistry of the chemical
version
but there&#39;s uh there&#39;s one with that
operates with
with uh under chemicals uh
with certain chemicals actually what
they&#39;ve done with
i think with these triangles that people
have seen is
they&#39;ve got like two or three of say 30
meter crafts
that are in this in the center of it
and the outside perimeter you know you
could put anything you want as long as
these particular ones are meet the
design criteria
and they&#39;ll operate uh then it&#39;s more or
less all that
other stuff on the outside is tagalong
but i&#39;m sure if they put a large weapon
up there and fired it it would probably
you know not work
or they&#39;d kill himself there were
certain reasons for the secrecy i
i could understand that no different
than
you know the first atomic bomb that they
built
but uh you know they&#39;re getting so far
ahead now
with aircraft design and people have
come up and they&#39;re visualizing and
seeing
some of the design aspects that are put
in some of the aircraft today
and eventually i&#39;m saying
and like i told you you gentlemen
earlier that 2003
most of this stuff will be out out
in everybody&#39;s plate to look at maybe
not the way that
everybody expects it but in some manner
they they determine
appropriate you know to show everybody
hey look at what we got
so you don&#39;t be surprised you think this
is the year 2000 that we&#39;re doing this
interview
so you think within three years that the
public will be told
i said this years ago 2003 and the
reason why i said that
the document i signed ends in 2003.
and you&#39;re not the only one that signed
and i&#39;m not the only one it&#39;s more
integrated
more integrated yeah see this uh
uh this i call it fogut or that&#39;s what
they call it
fundamentals of gravitational you know
uh
techniques techniques basically
but it&#39;s a volume now i&#39;m sure that
manual now is just expanded we&#39;re
no different than anything else that
they build for
design criteria because
anything we do today we have to have a
design criteria manual you know
and they put all the information in that
and if you ever get one of these volumes
of
this these documents you&#39;d be a
you&#39;d be on top of the world
you&#39;d know everything
but we couldn&#39;t see the aircraft itself
the speed the rate of speed that it was
moving when it when it when it went
across i mean it was moving in like a
regular aircraft then when it stopped
and when it did its movement and then
when it split into three and
when it went sped across the runway
going
it was going west
you know it was just going at a
phenomenal speed
