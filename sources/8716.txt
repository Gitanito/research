  		      4994.    Mathew B NDE     12/30/2021.      NDE 9324.            I heard a voice say, ‘everything is going to be alright, just chill out’, not in my voice, but in a voice that sounded like an older man, or a flower child from the 60’s. In other words, a hippie. I did not see who was talking or had I ever heard that voice before, but it felt familiar and comforting.  
  NDE due to unconsciousness resulting from neck and head injury.    

    4993.    Susie P NDE-like     12/26/2021.      NDE-like;SOBE 9323.       From the United Kingdom     As I died in this life and my spirit left me, my body lay motionless like a shell.  I became one with all the stars around me.  As I travelled out of my body I felt a sense of oneness with everything.  It was like flying around the cosmos seeing the form that exists in life.  Everything is made of energy and is all connected, I could see this clearly on the flight out of my body.  I dont know how long I was gone for;  time was not something I could gauge.  I got shown what the universe is like when you dont have a body.  It feels like being in outer space with a sense of everything and feeling the sensation of immense love.  
  SOBE associated with apparent inexplicable healing from brain cancer.   

    4992.    Al H NDE-like     12/25/2021.      NDE-like 9322.       Exceptional Experience.     The life story of every single tree I can see(thousands), the landscape and city that existed previously, colors and shapes that do not exist here.  It is at this point I take to just looking straight down at the ground as the information is too overwhelming for me. I begin to wonder towards something, I don't know what or why but I am drawn in a specific direction in the forest. I continue to walk for a good amount of time, and then I come upon a clearing and a river. Something I didn't notice before but in this forest there were no animals, they are all here. Lions, Tigers, deer, rabbits, cats, dogs, animals I've never seen before and do not exist on Earth. Everything is here, but there is no fighting, no hunting, no feeding, the animals do not attack one another.  
  Astounding SOBE, among the most remarkable and detailed ever shared with NDERF.   

    4991.    Nerise B NDE     12/14/2021.      NDE 9319.            The next thing I recall is feeling warm. I couldn't see anything but darkness. I didn't feel afraid. It was almost comfortable and cozy, like a warm hug. I couldn't hear anything. But just before I went into the darkness, I heard what I think was a nurse yelling for a crash cart.   
  NDE due to uterine rupture after delivery.   

    4990.    Carol S Probable NDE     12/13/2021.      Probable NDE 9318.            I became aware of my fiance, who had passed away 7 years ago. He was to the left of me up against my shoulder by my head. He had the most loving smile on his face. I was so happy that I was with him and we were communicating. I am not sure we were physically speaking; it was more like we just knew what we were saying to each other. He said, 'You know you can't stay, right?' I responded back, 'What??' and was feeling upset. He answered, 'Yes you have to go back.'   
  Probable NDE from nurse due to COVID infection with difficulty breathing.   

    4989.    Sarah B STE     12/13/2021.      STE 9315.       Exceptional Experience. From South Africa.     I have always believed in prayer. It does not matter to me where it comes from – God, the universe, the earth, a higher power – any prayer is pure love. And I felt it. Because deep and far away, I heard something in the darkness. I heard voices calling me. It wasn’t as literal as that. It was an awareness that came to me. Though the dark space I had a clear, distinct, and real thought. It cut through like a beacon calling me. I know that this was the turning point for me.  
  Exceptional epic struggle between life and death due to pneumonia and induced coma.  Dramatic encounter with her husband who was dying at the time.  Hallucinatory ICU delirium mixed with true spiritual experiences.   

    4988.    Bruce S NDE     12/9/2021.      NDE 9312.            I said, 'Ask them why am I here? What am I doing here? Am I dead?' He said, 'No you're not dead; just somewhere else in a different reality. I asked him, 'What do you mean?' He wouldn't answer me, only saying, 'I have something to tell you and that was whatever you do don't blame yourself for my death. It it wasn't your fault. It was my fault.'   
  NDE due to accident.   

    4987.    Sandy K NDE     12/4/2021.      NDE 9311.       From Canada.     I was not in my body but somewhere else. In a space that I can only describe as Heaven. Heaven was almost like being in the clouds but I wouldn't say it is this realm. It is another realm. There are not trees or earthly things, just space and it was sort of mystical. I was aware of the presence of someone with me. However, I couldn't see this person. Yet, he was all around me like surround sound and he could speak to me with his mind. We communicated telepathically. He showed me how wonderful life was and to not be afraid. Life is a miracle. 
  NDE at age 2 due to falling through ice into river.   

    4986.    Charlene R NDE     12/4/2021.      NDE 9310.            When I stood up, my vision or view focused on this new, wonderful place. I was met by a group of people. I knew all of them; they were former family members and a few friends. There were also a few I didn't know; one female and one male. The ground felt like I was floating midair above it. If I could feel it, I would liken it to silken grass but it was multi-colored. There were no trees. Yet there was a clear, golden-yellow sky like an early morning sun that goes into mid-morning.  
  NDE due to suicide attempt with heroin overdose.   

    4985.    Katty Q Probable NDE     12/1/2021.      Probable NDE 9308.       From Venezuela.     I saw a dark tunnel and it attracted me like 'the magnet attracts iron.' Then I saw an incandescent light that entered with a reflection that came from above. The light revealed itself to me I became aware of what was happening. I could see my body. I knew it was me because I recognized myself. I asked the Doctors to leave me alone. Yet, they could not hear me. I insisted and I know it bothered me because I felt very cold and asked to be covered. They did not do it either. Another very warm, Male voice spoke to me and said 'You can't leave until you finish what you started.'   
  Probable NDE due to complication of delivery.   

    4984.    Carrie B NDE     11/30/2021.      NDE 9307.            I was observing myself from above on a gurney in a hospital hallway with warm golden or orange lights or walls near a nurses stating and later in CT.  I’m sure plenty of people were there but I saw none other than my lifeless body.  Both memories are very quiet and serene, I was just floating and observing.  It was sad, frightening and peaceful.

    4983.    Catherine Ann M     11/30/2021.      Probable NDE 9305.            My spirit rose up above my body, to a place near the ceiling. As I was rising up, my first experience was sadness about what happened. Then, looking down on the scene. I saw my sister kneeling over my body, carefully checking my pulse. Another girl opened the door, and looked into the room. She had heard my sister scream, and asked if everything was OK. My sister said we were OK, and commanded her to leave. From above the scene, I experienced a brief communication on the matter.  
  Probable NDE due to apparent effort by her sister to kill her via stabbing.   

    4982.    Debra J NDE     11/26/2021.      NDE 9304.            The light was beyond what anyone could comprehend. I became very aware that all earthly things were gone and it was wonderful. The light was everything. The best way I can describe it is love in all it’s purity. Pure love like you don’t experience here. It seemed like I was there for a long time, but it was only minutes in earth time. There was no time there. You just are.  
  NDE at time of childbirth.   

    4981.    Marijan H STE     11/26/2021.      STE 9303.       Exceptional Experience. From Croatia.     Jesus spoke of slightly different things each time, but in the same context. He kept repeating that all people are connected to God, they just need to experience the knowledge of it. Everyone will experience it, but only at the moment of death. Those who come to this realization while they are still alive are extremely lucky, but in order to reach this realization they must deserve it with their faith, effort and deeds.

Non-Western NDE from Pakistan     People could not see me, but I was able to see and hear people doing daily routine tasks and talking to each. There were a lot of people there, even though I didn't know the place where I was in. I had never seen this place in my real life. I saw my family doing routine tasks. I also saw other people doing their work too, but they were strangers. I do know I was going somewhere, and was about half way there, when I started to hear my brother's voice.

    4979.    Joyce G NDE     11/17/2021 & 5/28/22.    SOBE;NDE-like 9301 and NDE 9406.       Exceptional Experience     No longer did I feel any burden of grief, no longer did I feel pain from my 40-year chronic spinal injuries, no mourning, no memories, just absolute release into the Light of Love! Home, as I now realize it! Incredible Love!  At that point, I was only consciousness, taken before the Light of Jesus. Words fail to ever capture the Vision of His Glory, but the experience now is more real than anything I could ever realize on earth. Everything was so beautiful and healing! I felt as if I were dissolved into the Light, with no words to ever capture the experience.  
  NDE due to drowning at age 2.  Shared 62 years later.   

      4978.    Dr. Sona B NDE     11/15/2021.      NDE 9300.            As I was going up this rather upright escalator, it occurred to me now that I am dead, who would take care of my daughters? I had two daughters who were 20 and 21 years old. 'Naw,' I thought, 'they would be just fine. My new husband would take care of them.'

      4977.    Ben B NDE     11/13/2021.      NDE 9298.       Hellish imagery and disturbing content.  Reader discretion advised.     'But the demons, and what I have been though are consuming me, sir I am tired of it'.  Suddenly a booming voice full of anger, but full of love and compassion said 'WHY DO YOU CONTINUE TO HATE, WHY DO YOU ABUSE YOUR SOUL THAT I CREATED MY CHILD? DO YOU KNOW WHAT REAL PAIN IS?' I suddenly got sucked into a darkness .  
  NDE due to suicide attempt with overdose of medication and cutting self.   

    4976.    Richard E NDE     11/8/2021.      NDE 9296.            The only two that I remember were my grandparents who had died some years before. I remember the feeling from them was reassurance that everything was OK. During my time there, which was hours although I was clinically dead for 5 minutes, I felt a great sense or peace and love. I could tell that this feeling flowed from the bright light which is God/Jesus. I could also see the Holy Spirit flowing through everything in the form of golden rays, if that makes sense.  
  NDE due to cardiac arrest during cardiac catherization.   

    4926.    Anne L NDE     5/30/2021 & 11/9/2021.      NDE 9215/9293.      Exceptional Experience.   There were two angels who were there with me. I was first met by the male angel who was dressed like a lumberjack with black, converse, high-top sneakers. I was laughing over this because, I mean, nobody wears those. I was amazed that he would choose that fashion choice. I still laugh about that. The female angel had on a yellow dress with blue flowers. The dress had short sleeves and a collar that bent down the front and the buttons were pearls. She had a 1950s hairstyle and little, light colored shoes. The female angel held a clothesline between us. I couldn't see or hear the third angel because I had no telepathic connection with it. The female angel was giving me a lot of information and the other angels were worried it was going to interfere with my free will, so she was stopped. 
  NDE at age 17 due to passing out from septicemia.  She is a nurse.  Shared 40 years later.   

    4975.    Bella L Probable NDE     11/3/2021.      Probable NDE 9292.            I’m flying very fast through a blue/green fluoresce tunnel, there is someone on each side of me and we are talking. It feels like it might be the nurse and the anesthesiologist. I am feeling euphoric. It feels like I am traveling faster than the speed of light, like in a sci-fi movie being transported through space. It seems like this continues for a long time, it feels very nice and I don’t want it to end. The two beings are with me, talking and supportive.  
  Probable NDE during anesthesia for endoscopy.  Experience shared within a day after its occurrence.   

      4974.    Elodie B Probable NDE     11/3/2021.      Probable NDE 9291.       From Qatar     Then I had the sensation that I was sucked into another dimension, into a vortex that was spinning anti-clockwise, and I could hear many vocalizations with echo. The vortex was very colorful, bright colors such as red, pink, yellow and blue. The colors were very graphic, a little bit like looking into a kaleidoscope. What I remember is hearing strange sounds, like bells, siren, or chimes.  
  Anesthesia awareness vs NDE during surgery.   

    4973.    Lyle R Possible NDE     11/3/2021.      Possible NDE 9290.            Immediately before opening my eyes, a message (not a voice, exactly) was 'impressed' upon me that 'Everything is going to be absolutely fine.' Even before I took account of my surroundings, this assurance was the impression that I had. I was being 'told' it without words and by a genderless 'voice' that wasn't mine.  
  Possible NDE due to cardiac arrest from drug overdose.   

    4972.    Karl R Possible NDE     10/28/2021.      Possible NDE 9289.       From Germany. Original in German, translated to English by Simone.     I already had several surgeries with general anesthetics, (at least 5). But during the gastroscopy in 2015, I went through such an emotional experience after waking up. I felt so much love. I wanted to give so much love. I wanted to learn another profession where I could help. Infinite Love.

    4971.    Barney J NDE     10/21/2021.      NDE 9286.       From Sweden     Then I saw a very strong and warm light, almost like the one you see when you look at galaxies. I felt like I was coming out of a tunnel when I saw the lights. It had different rings. The outer rings were darker than the inner rings. I then saw the names of my daughters in the brightest part of the light. The names where floating in the warm light.

    4970.    Gary S NDE     10/16/2021.      NDE 9284.            With me was a spirit being who guided me through the process of reviewing everything that had happened in my life, from very early childhood right up to that present moment. It seemed that my life memories formed a circle around me, like being inside a panorama. I relived my entire life, even long forgotten and seemingly insignificant memories. But now, with help from the spirit being, I had a sense of the larger picture that enabled me to see how my actions affected others and why certain things happened to me. There was no sadness or regret; rather, everything seemed absolutely perfect, just the way it all needed to be.  
  NDE due to valley fever and accidently ingesting apparently toxic mold   

    4969.    David H Probable NDE     10/16/2021 & 1/24/2023.      Probable NDE 9282/9522.            I remember being in a room.  I could not feel my shoulders or neck and realized that I did not have a body. I was an orb on a table and my face was like a round ball. In front of me was a man with black hair. He was dressed in a white, dress shirt with a long, black tie,  and black pants accented with  a gold, belt buckle. He looked at me for a few minutes and then said, 'You're not ready.' He used his right hand to pushed me back into my body.  
  Probable NDE due to coding while in hospital. Experience happened about 10 weeks before it was initially shared with NDERF. This is an integration experience shared again after several years.   

    4968.    Don R NDEs     10/12/2021.      NDEs 23476.            Next thing I can remember is thinking 'where am I going'?  As my soul turned to check my progress I had a sense of profound peace and tranquility like nothing I'd felt before.  I remember shadowy sillouettes around me and sensed 'that the world would be OK without me, I was forgiven for my sins, and love.  
  NDE due to motorcycle accident and NDE due to unspecified circumstances.   

      4967.    Neill H SDE     10/6/2021.      SDE;Shared ADC 32686.            In that seemingly empty, black darkness with only my mother's light, I was overwhelmed and surrounded with the greatest feeling of love that I've ever experienced. I've never experienced feeling loved that much in my entire life, if all of the love I've felt and received my entire life were combined it would only be about 2% of the love that my spirit felt in that place or dimension.  It was as if I were being loved by what I can only describe as being loved by a great (ALL).  
  Remarkable shared ADC with mother including journey to unearthly realm at the time she died.   

    4966.    Petro S NDE     10/6/2021.      NDE 9281.       From South Africa     I became aware of a Presence by my right shoulder, slightly towards the back, just out of view. In front of me was a soft pink glow, surrounded by even-softer green light. I was curious to see what it was, but I was asked by the Presence what I wanted to do: did I want to leave (earth) or did I want to stay (with my family on earth). No words were spoken, it was just like an understanding; comprehending intelligence on another level.  
  NDE due to complications of delivery.   

      4965.    Faleysiya C Probable NDE     10/6/2021.      Probable NDE 9280.       From Chile.  Original in Spanish, translated to English by Camille.     During my NDE, I was walking behind an old man with a hood who was carrying a lantern in his hand; we entered a dark tunnel, where hands came out from the sides of the tunnel, moaning and trying to touch me; the floor was slimy. Upon leaving the tunnel, the old man disappeared, and I was floating in a white light, similar to a cloudy day and in the background, there were the mountains of China, wrapped a little in mist (in my room I had a painting with Chinese mountains), but very far from me. My feeling was one of total anguish because I was completely alone and there was nowhere to go, I didn't understand what was happening.  
  Probable NDE due to being hit by bus.   

    4964.    Cassandra Probable FDE     10/1/2021.      Probable FDE 9279.            At some point I remember leaving my body and being in another realm. There was no fear, anxiety, or stress. As you recall and I’m pretty much traumatized at this point and pretty confident that I am almost dead. I was terrified until I left my body. Once I was up there I remember feeling like I was wrapped in a love in a way I’ve never felt love in my life. I’ve explained it as feeling like I was in a womb. I could feel a presence by me and I remember seeing a light. It felt like three or four days of me telepathically communicating to the presence.  
  Probable fear-death experience while being treated for metastatic esophagus cancer.   

    4963.    Travis S Probable NDE     9/21/2021.      Probable NDE 9274.            I was overcome with the love of these people, I could feel it strongly, and things about these people were simply communicated to my heart  For a moment, still thinking this was an application, I thought to ask them their names.  However, I recognized them and they felt so familiar that I thought it would be inappropriate, even embarrassing to do so.  Nobody needed to exclaim their love for me, for I felt it.  
  Probable NDE due to complications of COVID infection.  Interesting contrast between obvious hallucinations and the probable NDE.   

    4962.    Shawnise C NDE     9/21/2021.      NDE 9273.            I was immortal floating towards a warm inviting being of light in a dark tunnel. I felt pure and light as a feather floating up effortlessly towards the light. I couldn't take my eyes off the light, I was deeply engaged. The dark tunnel turned into rays of vibrant light, a blend of futuristic colors and the space around me and beyond me was endless...Then, I heard the most beautiful composed instruments of music and peaceful sounds, I was mesmerized.  
  NDE due to cardiac arrest following severe post-surgical complications.   

    4961.    Kim A NDE     9/20/2021.      NDE 9272.            One communicated with me, like thoughts flowing back and forth. I felt love, unconditional regard. The being, whom I'll call a spirit guide, although it could've been an angel, asked me a question. If this marked the end of my life, would I be satisfied with how it went? All I had said and done, and specifically how I responded to what was said and done to me? Almost immediately, I was shown and taken into a large glowing orb, as big as the end of a room. On the outside it was alive with flashes, moving like hot lava.  
  NDE due to atrial fibrillation while hospitalized for sepsis.   

    4960.    Katharine S Possible NDE     9/20/2021.      Possible NDE 9271.            That was when I saw images flash and flicker by at first, then it became clear like I was sitting in a far away place, almost dream like except I couldn't wake myself and I could feel, see, hear things like it was real life. I sat on the ground, some type of soft white/grey marble it seemed like as if it was both cushiony and rock hard at once, and there were figures up on this judge like looking stand made of the same material but I could see most of them but not all of their figures at once; there was like 5+ people.  
  Possible NDE due to suicide attempt with medication overdose and exposure to cold.  Atypical content.   

    4959.    Martina S Probable NDE     9/10/2021.      Probable NDE 9270.       From Germany.  Original in German, translated to English by Marguy.     I was playing cards with my great-grandma, my aunt and my grandma and then asked for some more coffee. My aunt then said to me: “No, because you now have to go back home. I briefly wondered who had to decide that I would have to go home, as I already moved out from home for a time, but I didn't discuss this and simply accepted it. Probably it was at that moment that I remembered my dogs still being 'at home' and that I didn't know for how long I was 'here' and what would happen to them if I was 'away'.  
  Probable NDE due to car crash.   

    4958.    Barbara W FDE     9/8/2021.      FDE 23474.            The moment the headlight was in front of me I was quickly taken to a place away from the bus, there were several angel-like beings there and I was frantically telling them that I have a young daughter to care for.  After that I remember being many yards away from the bus frantically picking up my belongings.  I have always thought that this was an intervention.  
  Fear-death experience when hit by bus.   

    4957.    Angela B STE     9/7/2021.      Prayer;STE 9268.       Exceptional Experience     As the angel stood to my left and my father spoke to me from my right, a very large, powerful presence hovered over the length of my body.  When I noticed the large presence, my inner vision was changed to that of a crystal blue waterfall.  The water was sparkling clear and the most beautiful blue I have ever seen.  As I marveled at the sight of the water, the static sensation in my torso dissipated and was replaced with a sensation of liquid love rushing into my heart.  
  Prayer Experience-STE after taking too much medication for migraine headache.   

      4956.    Cheltsey T NDE     9/4/2021.      NDE 9267.            There were SO many beautiful and BRIGHT colors that we don’t have on Earth. I remember being welcomed and having an overwhelming sense of comfort and Happiness. Everything was perfect. We didn't need to breathe, eat or sleep. There was no pain. All I needed to do was to be in the moment with a higher being. I met Jesus and he spoke to me. I asked him if I could stay because I felt so happy and loved being in that perfect place.  
  NDE due to apparent cardiac arrest at age 8 while undergoing open heart surgery.   

    4955.    Bethany I NDE     9/4/2021.      NDE 9266.            Then there was only silence like I’ve never felt. So bright and so still. I began to move forward in the light and call 'Jesus' over and over. I went from being 'afraid to leave' to 'feeling peace'. Then I saw my three children’s faces flash before my eyes. After seeing this rapid slideshow of images, it was as if I crashed back onto the operating table. 
  NDE due to anesthesia complication during surgery.  Experience happened less than two weeks prior to it being shared with NDERF.   

    4954.    Debora C NDE     9/4/2021.      NDE 9265.            To the right of the gate was Jesus extending his hands to me wearing a white long robe. I couldn't see his face, but just a bright light. I felt loved by him. I knew I wasn't in danger and Jesus touched my head. Jesus turned me around for the little girl to walk me back down the dark path. Of course, I did not know this was Jesus until years later. 
  NDE due to drowning at age 5.  Shared 53 years later.   

    4953.    Norman T NDE     9/3/2021.      NDE 9262.            I remember walking towards a bright light. I saw my life review which was so peaceful. All of a sudden, I heard a voice saying that it was not my time. I felt as if I was on cloud 9, so when I got back into my body, I woke up and yelled for my friend. He did not answer, so I thought he died. When my soul came back into my body, I felt complete numbness from my waist down.
  NDE due to auto accident.   

    4952.    Luis S Other     8/26/2021.      Drug Experience;Other 9257.       From Spain     I kept on getting closer to this white light, but now I was close enough to notice that the white light was always there, and the colors were like flowing outside of it and kind of dancing around it, a similar concept of solar eruptions that come out of the sun, and then coming back inside the sun, like dolphins jumping out of water having fun and then returning to their home.
  Many DMT experiences with profound spiritual insight.   

    4951.    Christoph K NDE     8/24/2021.      NDE 9259.       From Germany.  Original in German, translated to English by Marguy.     The doctors and nurses trying to save my life seemed familiar; as if they had been longtime friends. During my unconsciousness, I had many questions answered in a strange way. I didn't see a tunnel. There was a light that seemed to vibrate and emit a kind of sound. I can't explain this, but the light took my fear away.   
  NDE due to pulmonary embolism.  Shared about three weeks after NDE.   

    4950.    Charles W NDE     8/23/2021.      NDE 9260.            The scene was relatively quiet, but not static: the scientists were occasionally talking softly to each other, moving, changing microscope slides, doing things with test tubes, someone occasionally bringing something to someone else. It was peaceful and calm, and the scientists seemed to have a sense of purpose. The oddest thing about the scene was that everything was in black-and-white--like an old movie, but I was not watching a movie, I was there in the room with them--if I'd looked down at myself, I would have been in black-and-white as well. 
  NDE due to cardiac arrest during cardiac procedure. Atypical content.   

      4949.    Alba Monn SDE     8/18/2021.      SDE 9253.       From Germany.  Original in German, translated to English by Marguy.     I experienced a space out of time. I had a telepathic conversation with my daughter, and she started it with prompting me to: “Forgive him!” I couldn't see any sense in this. In a telepathic dialog, that I later wrote down word for word, I explained to her that I considered his attitude as unpardonable. She told me everything I needed, to open up my close-minded perspective of pride and self-righteousness, and I could understand intellectually that pardon was preferable. She disclosed that she too could forgive, but that with her it was a matter of all her life! In this moment I supposed she was talking about a physical and mental disability and not about her own death.  
  Remarkable shared near-death experience with daughter who died in the accident causing the NDE of Alba.   

    4948.    Ray F NDE     8/17/2021.      NDE 9258.            I could see people milling around in the light; some were standing in the lighted area and others just between the light rim and the dark. As I moved closer, I could see children about my age playing with a whole bunch of puppies. I wasn’t able to get down to play with the children because the twister kind of held me like a mother cradling a baby.  
  NDE at age 5 due to allergic reaction to wasp sting.  Shared 63 years later.   

    4947.    James M NDE     8/17/2021.      NDE 9256.            Everything went black. Then I saw bright light above me and I headed towards it. I heard noise below me and realized I was on top of the ceiling of the deck. I turned to look down and saw my body lying on the deck. Then my friend's grandfather walked out and exclaimed, 'Look what you did! You killed him!' 
  NDE at age 9 due to accidentally being shot in head with pellet gun. Shared 58 years later.

Then I was sucked to the light in an instant and came out the other side. It was such a beautiful place. I was in a meadow with green grass about 6 to 8 inches tall. The grass was swaying in the wind. Off to my left was a high hill with a creek running down from it. I noticed six or seven figures standing on the other side of the creek. 
  Probable NDE due to illness.   

    4945.    Beatrice W NDE     8/14/2021.      NDE 9251.       Exceptional Experience from Germany.  Original in German, translated to English by Marguy.     This was pure freedom and simply the most natural thing of the world, as if I never had been doing anything else. And I knew, 'THAT's my home, my original BEING, the original EXISTENCE of all of us, the home of ALL our souls. It's from here that I come and it's here that I belong. We all come from here and we will all come back here. A deeply familiar sensation of HOME and BELONGING pervaded me completely. I was ONE with everything. There are no earthly words giving me the possibility to describe this deeply anchored knowledge, this memory, and this beloved feeling of home.   
  Exceptional NDE due to loss of consciousness due to allergic reaction.   

  4944. Requested removal

    4943.    Amy G NDE     8/10/2021.      NDE 9249.            While she was on top of me strangling me I left my body.

I saw people gradually gathering around me. Then I shifted my gaze and looked at my bedroom on the second-floor to the right. I saw my grandmother running down the stairs in panic. I was watching each of her steps clearly while she was running down the stairs. 
  Child's NDE from being hit by a car.   

  4941.    Krystal L NDE     7/26/2021.      NDE 9242.            I remember everything started going in slow motion and playing out as if it were me who was watching my life through a television. Then all of a sudden, that television show stopped and there was a sort of void like a 'commercial break.' Then it started again, like it was a rerun of the same show but it was all in reverse. All the words were backwards.

    4940.    Andre V NDE     7/25/2021.      NDE 9243.            Next, I asked, 'Any of you guys know where we are going?' They all pointed to the bright portal. One of them said, 'We are going to purgatory.' I asked, 'What will we do when we get there?' Someone said, 'This is where we give a review of EVERY decision we ever made while we were on earth, see how those decisions we made affected God’s plans, and see how it affected others people's decisions they made.' I replied, 'That is going to take YEARS.' The reply was, 'Time only exists on earth.'

To go further, I would need to go through a gate. While I waited, the person at the gate came back and said it was my time go back. But I know if a family member who had passed away and brought me past the gate that I wasn’t coming back. 
  NDE due to complication of cardiology procedure.   

    4938.    Gregory B Probable NDE     7/19/2021.      Probable NDE 9240.            When I passed out with the IV in me, my soul/consciousness woke up right outside my body. I instantly remembered the dream, I had a week before. My spirit guide offered me a life plan. Incidentally, my guide appears to me as a cartoon because I didn't get to watch the cartoons I wanted as a kid. He also asked whether I wanted to go to the light and die.  
  Probable NDE due to drug overdose.   
  
    4937.    Stefan vdB NDE     7/12/2021.      NDE 4937.       From the Netherlands     Everything was white. In the distance I saw a white wall. The wall was as big as a townhouse on it's side. The wall was white and behind it was a radiance emitting quite a bright white light. The white light was emitting light in a circular shape and the shape was larger than the wall. I could not see what was behind the wall, I just saw the radiant light. I did see 2 people standing on the other side of the wall. They were facing whatever / whoever was behind the wall. They were small in comparison to the wall. One was standing and was calm. The other one seemed like a very strong, bearded man, age 50 or so kneeling and crying before the light... While we were approaching the light I could feel the light. It's a feeling I will never forget. It was pure love. So much love it was overwhelming. I had to cry of joy.

There was a precipice that emptied in the sky. I knew if I left the tunnel, that I would enter heaven. My dad appeared out of nowhere and kissed my forehead. He pushed very hard against my chest. 
  NDE due to suicide attempt with pills.   

    4935.    Todd C NDEs     7/2/2021.      NDEs 9230.            I was sitting on a huge chair, like a throne. There were two doorways with no doors. It was just an arched doorway. The walls and the floor were tan. I think the doorways were actually mirrors of your spirit or soul. They showed you your deeds while on earth. This mechanism is impossible to fool because you can't fool yourself. 
  Two NDEs due to heart attacks.  One brief and one more prolonged.
