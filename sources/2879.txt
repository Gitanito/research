THE followmg reply to the "Awful Exposure,"
con~ists of two parts. Part I. is occupied with
an examination and refutation ofthat book. And Part
II. contains the principal arguments, \vhich may be
adduced in confirmation of Maria Monk's "Awful
Disclosures." The work is somewhat more exten-
sive than it was first designed to be ;. and yet, in
;Some respects, it is less full than could be wished,
or than was originally intended. On some points,
the author has failed m his attempts to obtain from
Canada, such information as he has sought for.
It appears that, for some cause or oiher, several of
his letters sent' by mail to gentlemen in Montreal,
have ne,·er been received by the persons to whom
they were directed.
The author has nlso found an extreme backward-
ness on the part of individuals, especially in Canada,
to furnish such testimony as they possess, in support
of Miss Monk's claims to public confidence; in
some instances, he has met with an absolute refusal;.
in others, he has received a strict prohibition to pub-
lish any thing in connexion with their name!9. This
is particularly true, as it respects Miss Monk's near-
est relatives, some of whom are using every means
in their power to induce her to de11y the t1·uth ni
4 INTRODECTIO!f,
her narrative, going so far nseven to thre:tten her
life, if she does not do it. The public will deducu
their own inferences from such conduct.
The author·would further remark, that his pro-
duction has the.usual defects of haste in composi·
tion. From a variety of circumstances, he has felt
himself compelled to hasten his publ~cation, as rap-
idly as possible. He has done the best he r.ould
under existing circumstances. His sole object has
been to elicit and exhibit.the truth, in regard to the
"Awful Disclosures.'' He hns, th~'r'cfore, one re-
quest to make of the public, and it is c~rtninly a
\·ery just one. lt is, that he mny receive nn impar-
tial trial, bt.fore he shall be comlemnt>d, t>ither as to
.his moth'es or his conduct. The subject is extreme·
Jy exciting, an~ is attended with difficulties peculiar
to itself. It ·would ben ·wonder, therefore, ifhe had
·not erred in some mino.r particulars; but he will ac-
knowledge his errors, whatever they mny be, as soon
ns they shnll be satisfactorily pointed oat to him. The
subject is one of deep and solemn interest to the
parties conc~rned, nnd all he wishes in regard to
the matter is, thnt the truth, whatever it may be,
mny be brought to light.

with fery little tro~ble;.and have _s~ved the world from

been opened for the inspection of a few impartial ex-
aminers, when she first appealed to the test of exami-

the truth of Maria Monk's ·statements, interspel'!'ed
with-jeers 'and scoffs at her and her friends. Then
comes a chapter of some ~ight or nine pages as a
"biographical article on the life of Maria Monk,"-
the character of which I forbear naming at present.
The remainder of the book contains affidavits and·let·

Whoever will take the trouble to examine this book ·
of the priests, will find it to be _of a character ex·

and.that is, if the priests 'have the truth on their side,
their cause is most wretchedly managed in the pre-
sent instance. · ~
A spec~men of th~ eoarse vulgarity spoken of may
be seen, ill the manner in which Miss Monk is gener-
ally spoken of by the priests. •rliey call her " .Monk
.tl&e th.ief/' "the tool Monk,'' "tkt pro•titute Monk,"
&e. &c. In a single-chapter she .is called "Monk"
upwards of seventy times. Now, whatever the char-
acter of Maria Monk may-be, it can .afford no justifi-
cation for so gross a breach on the appropriate use of
language. It lwth offends and insults the readers
themselves.
The .authors of the "Awful Exposure," are very
clamorous respecting matters in Maria Monk's book
which are of triHing importance to·mankind,-sueh
as Miss Monk's ignorance of dates:_of the proper use
and translation of French phrases-of the correct
spelling of names-:-af the true namea of the different
convents, and ·of their fo.unders, &c. &c. Now sup·
pose she has erred in these -
matters, what does it
amount to'l If in spelling Bourgeois,·she spells it
Bourgeoise, adding the letter e, when, according to
the priests, it.should not be added, what is the mis-
chief done 1 ,
This mistake is more than once gravely
pointed out, by the writers. of the" Awful Exposure."
Respecting dates theyr~mark:-"We repeat here that
the utter. ab~Jice of dates from the pretended ' Dis-
closures,'_ought in itself to have been sufficient to
cause,their rejection .by a man of common sense and
common honesty." This is very remarkable·indeed.

were it.not .trifling with the reader's patience, it w·ere
easy to. $bow that most of the ebarges brought
.against her book, in respect to these mahfrs, are with-
out foundation. It were easy to point out two literary
blunders in their own book, for·every one ·that can b~
marked in hers. But I forbear, as it would be of no
use to the cause of truth. The assertion, however,
that her book is without dates is untrue·

themselves contradicting it, aM will -be shown. hereaf-

THE " Awful Exposure" devotes one of its chap-
ters to pointing out misrepresentations, said to be con·
tained in Maria Monk's book. This chapter, however,
like several others, is occupied simply with contradic·
tions, and ridicule of her statements. Maria Mo:1k
declare:> that certain things anc.l practices existed in
the Congregational Nunnery and in the Hotel Dieu,

Maria Monk travelled from New York to Montreal,
and there, upon oath, made·hei' solemn·eha1ges against
·the inmates and·visiters of the Convent; and appeal-
ed to a simple·test, ~asily applied; by which, if untrue,
they could have been ·disproved in a single · hour.
Certainly, on her part, this looks ·Jike honesty, in the
highest · degreer·· On the other hand, the eor:duct of
the priests has ··every appearance of conscious guilt.
Matters being thuta, therefore,· the unsupported con·
tradictions of the priests, w.hen placed in the scale op·
posite to Miss Monk's stateme~ts,·are lighter than a
"puff of empty air."
It is not my design to notice ·an the particulars,
conc~rnin,g ·which, the prie-sts· declare that ·Maria .
Monk ·has made false statement~. ·. In themselves
considered, many of these things are of no'conseqoenee.
I shall ther_
efore notice only 'a few of them ; enough,
howeyer, to show that the .Writersofthe "Awful Expo- ·
sure";are as destitu~e of veracity, as th~y would fain
have us to believe that Miss M. is. I confess that my
main object at present is to show, tliat no confidence
wbat'ever can be reposed in any thing these men say.

and locking her up hr hia statt·room,"-evidently re·
fera to·tb.e voyage which she iays she made on board
.ofhia boat, just before bet attempt to drown herself in
th~ Lachine canal. This was in November, 1834,
though it is said.in the prieJts' account pf it, to ha\'O
been in the year 1829. Now it is my deliberate opin·
. ion, that tbe prieata have inserted 1829, in the place
of 1834.- How,.could Miss Monk's. account of the
voyage agree so cxactfy with that of Capt. Arm-
.strong's, except the year, unless they bQth refer to the
·lame voyage 1 "Awful Disclosures," page 262.
The priests say that Maria Monk \vas an inmate of
the .Montreal Magdalen Asylum, from the close o(
November, 1834, unti) about the beginning of ~arch,
1835. ·Respecting her conduct while there, o~ page
78 they say :-" It was· even discovered that the se-
clusion of the AsyIurn; did not pr~vtmt her from re-
newing her int~rct>urse with the c.•onstable. . She re~
ccived his visit!, and held converse with hi~ . thrQ'Jgh
the yard enclosure." Now compare this with what
the constable Malo s.ays in his affidavit, page 93. He
··affinos. that he parted with Maria.Monk sometime in
·October, 1834, and that be '~ Ilever heard of her after-
wards, until .about the 'e:nly part of the month o(
· September last, ( 1835. )" Here then is a direct con-
tradiction ·betwe~n· the parties. The priests declare
·that the eonsta&le paid his vi~its tn Maria Monk ·du- •
ring the winter cf 1834-35; while the constable af-
firms that he oeyer heard of her from Octo~r, 1834,
until Septemb~r, 1835. H~re- again the priests have

·bas ptrjured himt:elf. It is to b~ hoped that the old
ad11e will prove tru~ in thia-inatance, that "when
roguea ·fall out, honest mttri will get their due." Now
if the priests and their witne11es thus contradict each
other, what conJldenee can be put in the tfltimony of
either'l · · •
Again, on page 96, we are told-" That there ate
four 'Periods mentioned in the' Awful Disclosures,' at .
which it is pretended that Mi11 Monk·WII an inmate
of the Hotel Dieu." What is said here, is r~peatedly
denied in other parts of their book. On page 8, there
'is the tbllowing unqualified declaration, e:rpre11ed in
italics : "In the Awful Disclosur~s, there i• not a
•in1le date from the commmcem~nt to the tnd !"
Thus this work of the priests broadly a~terts a tbinr
in one place, ·and .then aa flatly contradicts it in· an-
other. A house divided ·againat itself cannot atand.
On page 67 of their work, itreada thus:-" We cite
the following additional instlfnce of the contradictions
in the 'Diaclosures,' and we aak the candid· reader if
there can be found language too strong to expre11 the
just abhorrence which the conduct of the adviaers of
Monk must inspire. · It .is stated at page 222, that it
·was well known· to some of the nuns that she had
twice left the convent from choice. Now we defy the
most subtle ·inquirer to discover from the previous
narrative that she had twice le(t the conTent, either
. from choice or otherwise,, If the reader will take the
· trouble to look' on page 22 of." Awful 'Disclosures,"
he may read as follows !-"After I had been in .the
Congregational Nunnery ·ahout two yeara, I left it,"
· &c. Here, then, she·tells us that she left die eonvent

Again, OD paie·2t, we Jead at foU4>Wt:-" Another
story i• told her (Maria Mon ,) by agh·l of the school,
of.a murder committed.by a prieet on the person of a
young 11qua\v. .Why the priest )Jlurdered, and why he
then ran away, are moss ingeniously accounted for;
it is intimated as a reaSOB for the latter, that timely
nutice was conveyed to him i._ a _
nole by. an Indian."
Maria Monk's narradve .of thia ~ft'ak may be seen on
page 20, of her book. She ·states there, tha~t, "a note
was found on his (the priest's) table, addressed to
him, telling him to tly if he:was guil.ty." She does
not intimate that" timely notice was,conveyed to him
in a taote by an-Indian." ·This i~ another priestly
misrepresentation, made for the· purpose of exci,ing
contempt for her statements. .
In speaking of the three convents of Montreal,
Maria Monk 1ays on page 16 of her work, that, " In
all, large quantities of variout ornaments are made by
the nuns, which are exposed for sale in the orna11ae1&t ·
rooms, an:d aft'ord large pecunia_ry receipts every year;

of charity or a Congregational nun, or whatever elSe

neeted with the Montreal convents. Her· name is
Mis~ Keoph, and she is a teacherof young ladies, and
when she_gets a company of them suitably bewitched
to go to the Montreal convents "to ~nisb their educa-

four years !tince, ·accompanied by six of her pupils,
she travelled in company with iny informant, a gen- ·

almC?st as endless as they are 11ickenini to a virLuous
mind. . On page 85, $peaking of her residence in St.
Denis, they say :-:-" She pursued her adopted profe!l·
aioQ (sehoul te:lching) during the spring, .summer,
and !lU~~mn of 1833, an.d .on !he 2d of Decemb.er in
th~ same year, entered the ,clllployment of Miss
Louise .Bousquet,- government ~chool Mistress, as
her English Assistant.'' Miss Bousquet testifies that
she remained as·English teacher in her school about
seven monLhs. The _
point to which I wish to direct
thf: attention of. the reader, in this connexion, is
this :-:-.T_
hat a girl.of Maria Monk's. alleged charac-
ter shQuld have been thus employed as a school
teacher. It seems that this singular compound of
"confirmed"'vagra.ncy;" "11trange flightiness and
ttnaccoutZtable irregularities,'~ "insanity," "thiev·
ery,"."lies," and '"profligacy," was employed from
the spring of 1833, until the month .of July, 1834, as
an English sehoul teacher, in·St. Denis ! . In the fol-
lowing November, they tell U31 she entered the Mag-
dalen Asylum, of Montreal, under the managem~nt
of " the exemplary and charitable Mrs. McDonell,"
\vbo, "after making oath on the Holy Evangelists,
declare~ : That she understood that the said Maria
had, for many_ years, led the Hf~ of a strDlle~ and a
prostit.ute.'.' Several of Mrs. McDonell's pupils in the
Asylum swear t.o the same thing. Thus we are told
on one page that Maria .Monk was teaching school
in St. Denis, for some 14 or 15 months: and then on
another, n whole tribe of Magdalens, Matron and all,
come forward and swear that she was leading, at the
same time, the life of a wandering prostitute. Oh,

ter of Mn;ia Morik ·unblaekened, .these men charge
:upon her the .~ant of respect towards her mother•
·On: page 82,-they say:·-" The ~oneluct of Monk
towards her mother has always been ungrateful ; and
her habit of indulging in calumnious remarks on her
parent, could be testified to by hundreds,of witne~a­
·es."· · ··Yes: so could any thing else by such Wit-
nesses. It were no great matter to prove, by such
chaTacterlf; that the Sl;Jtl Was a jack-o'-lant~rn, the
moon a haystack, ·and the·stan, a fiock of'sheep. .
The charge here brought' against Miss: Monk, by
her imbittered enemies, I am confident, has no foun-
.·dation in truth. One thing is certain, if ever a child
had.cause for unkind f~eling towards a parent, it is
Maria Mo.nk. Mrs. Motik has treated her daughter
in a most unfeeling and unparental manni-r. Her
conduct relating ·to ·her pretended affidavit, ·is unpar-
·donable. Alas, that a mother could ever become so
callou!l in h~r feelings towards an own child, bone of
·her bone, and flesh of her flesh ! Mrs. Monk kno,n,
as well as she knows any thing, that many of the
state~ents, which she is represented as making in
·ber affidavit, are untrue~ · She ought, therefore, to re-
pent for having s.old hers·eJf to such a body ofunprin-
cipled inen, ·as are the Montreal Romis~ priests. ·It
is true, as I · believe, she has represented to Maria,
that she never swore to the affidavit which bears her
uame; that ·the priests carried it to her, and secured
a . promise from her that she never would conmldict
its Rtatements. Hence the fact, that it is without her
signature. This sbe ought to publish to the world, and
to do all she can to vindicate her daughter, ftom the
numberless calumnies which are heaped upon her.
On the other hand, the feelings of Maria towards her

On .page 7;3, we have the celebrated pencil story.
It is as .follows:--:-" It appears that Maria~ .while at
school, had her ear perfor11ted by a slate pencil,.~nd
that a piece of the pencil has remained in her ear to
this day. Her sufferings arisipg from this cause have
been acute, and have led to the s~pposition that her
intP.llect bas been from the. time.of .the accident, seri- ··
ously and badly. affected. It is kno\vn to ·m~dical
jurisconsults, that no question is of more difficult de:-
termination than .that of alleged insanity. Thus i.t
has happened that the cause ·of her malady still s.uh-
sists, and that she still endures its effects." To @ay
the least, this is a ~urious piece of historic knowledge.
There are, ho\Ve\·~r, two statemcnta in it, which are
as distant from truth, as the southern.from the port4-
ern pole. First, the declaration that a piece of a slate
pen'!il remains in hl·r ear to this.day, is too ridicu-
lously false to deserve hardly a passing notice. The
origin of the story is this; when Maria Monk was
quite a chiiJ, she .and another little girl were at play,
and they put each into the .ot~cr's car a piece of sl.ate
pencil. Maria says the piece in her. car .rem~~~~d for

tiY.ely' tell, now, whether it w.as in her right, or in
her left ear. · The·assertion, therefore, that it remains
to this day in her ear, and that ~the still sutrera from
it, is destitute of the least semblance of truth. But
we ·are told tha·t the pencil remains, seriously affect·
ing hu intellect, and , producing, if not absolute in-
sanity; "strange flightiness and unaccountable irregu-
larities.'' But .to .talk of an effect without a cause,
is an absurdity ; .and in the present case we see that
the alleoged cause does .not exist. · Therefore the al-
leged eft'ect·cannot exist. If -Maria Monk is insane,
it is unaccountable that none of her friends in New
York have ever been able to discover the least indica-
tions of it. ·. When her friends call to mind what she
has paised through since she left the convent, .they
wonder that she has ·not been driven to insanity.
Not one female in ten thousand would have·endured
the ordeal, through which she .has been enabled to
pass without injury. With .an infant in her arms,
she commenced the contest. She told ber sad tale;
but scarce anybody was prepared to believe it. It
was too horrible for belief. Hence all about her was
suspicion. · H.er circumstances were suspicious. She
was examined, re::-examined, and cross-examine.~ by
every sort of people. She has been persecuted by
Catholics and _
by Protestants. · Malice has direct-
ed against her· its bittert-st arrows of slander. Her
feelings haye been excited to the highest pitch
for days and weeks, for she is naturally very ex-
citable; being constitutionally sensitive. And yet,
amidst all her excitements, 3he has never given nny
symptoms ·of insanity while she has been in New
York. What confidence-, therefore, can be reposed

was mad or insane, and also Miss Harrison, andnow
Maria Monk.: ·
"Among·the instrnctions·given us by the priests,',.
says Maria. Monk, "some of the most pointed were
those directed· against 'the Pl!otestanf'· Bible. They
often enlarged uponthe evil tendency ofthatbook, and
·told us ·that but·for it many a soul new condemned to.

Monk or her opponents, the. priests 1 Every intelli-
gent reader will reply at .once, Maria Monk. Be-
cause her statements ogr~e perfectly with the instruc-
tions, on this subject, given by popes .and Councils :
and on th·e other hand the language ofher antagonists,
is condemned by these high and infallible Rornisb
authorities. A few ·specimens shall here he giveu,
illustrating and ·co~firming the ..t~uth of this declara-
tion. In 1713, Pope Clement XI. issued t~e celebra-
ted bull Unigtnitm. In this he· condemns certain
"Moral reflections on the New Testament," by Fa-
ther Quesnel, stigmatizing them as "false, captious,
schocking, offensive to pious ears, scandalous, perni-
cious, rash, seditiou11, impious, blasphemous." AlllOng
the reflections thus unmercifully condemned by " his
holiness;" the following are ·to be found : that " it is
useful and. necessary, at'all times, in all places, and
for all sorts of persons, to study an«:{ know the spirit,
piety, and mysteries ofthe l{oly Scripture;" that "the
reading of the Holy . Scripture is . for everybody;"
that "the Lord's day o·ught to be sanctified by Chris-
tians in reading .pious boob, and above all, the' Holy
Scriptures." ·. In 1816, Pope Pius VII.·writing to the
Archbishop of Gne:r.n, callM the Bible Society a " most .
erafty device, by which the very foundations ofreligion
arr. undermined," a "pestilence," and "defilement of
the faith, most imminently dangerous to souls." Pope
Leo XII. in 1824, speaking of the same institution,
says that it "strolls with. effrontery·throughout the
world, contemning the traditions of the Holy Fathers,
and c~ntrary to the ~well known decree of the Coun-

bitter are the pepes against a society which labors
to furnish mankind with ·the wonl of <loci, in lan-
guages which they can react. ·But as the subject is of
such Yital importance, and ..as eome Catholics admit
.chat popes may er.r in their deci1ion1, but all agree
.that a general oooncil 181lCtiODed. by. a. pope CBDnOtr
.1 will here subjoin the'fourth rule-of the Congrega-
.tion of the Index, of the Council of Trent, which is
the laat general couneil ever beJd by the Romish
·Church.. It is as follow.a :!-"·Inasmueh.as itia mani-

Truly,.the Bible must be a very ba~ book, or infal-

is, there is no book in :the world 10 destructive to
·Catholicism as is the Bible. It is not to be wondered
· ~t, therefore, ·tllat pneral councils,. popes, bishops,
and priests, are so an&ious to lockit up in a language
which tQe people do not understanil. Nor is it to be
wopdered at, :
that, when !the people become so rebel-

The misstatements and·contradictions of the priest•

It is .painful to the writer of these pages, and doubt-

an atmosphere 110 .impure. I ~hall, therefore, briefty
Rllude only to a few more of them in this connuion.
The priests contr~dict the statement of Mi~ts Monk,
that nuns, on their reception, _
have assigned to them
the names of saints, as St: .Mary, St. Eustace, St.
Frances, &c. T~ey also deny that priests, with the
e~ception of'tbe chaplain of each, ever vi,it eitber the
Hotel Dieu or tl.ae Congregational nunneries. These
denial$ are so notoriou~ly ·untrue, th_
at. it is matter or
nstoni!~ment, how the priests were e'er so fooli1h as
to make them. Ask almost any female, Catholic or .
Protestant, who ever attended the Congregational
nunnery sch:>ol,·and·the will tell you at once that the
priet~ts are in error. They ·~eny Maria Monk's state·
ment,that there .are about one hundred and fifty priests
connected with the ·seminary of Montreal, which i3 a
place of. general rendezvous for all the priests in the
distric'tofMontreal. .' Now they do Qatdeny that there
are this number or priests in the district, nor that they
all occasionally resort to the'seminary; but they deny
that all are .connected with the seminary as an incor-
porated body. · This is marvellous. 'r.hey also deny
Mis3 Monk's statements respecting the number ol
novice~ and nuns in the Hotel Dieu. nunnery; and
they 1:mpport their ·denial by quotations from an· old

the belief that the number of novices and nuns •is
much smaller than it really is. The fact, thnt the
·comminee who examined the Hotel Dieu in July last,
and since.then Col.' Stone, found the number of nuns
to agree ,fitb the sttlteme,nt of th~s old alm:mae, has
led some to doubt Maria Monk's statement ns to their
number• . Sueh should' remember that it is a very
easy'mntter.for ·th4! prie!tts'to remove as great a num-
ber as they choose. They can remove them to the
~u~bec Hotel Dieu; and td th·~ nun'~ .island, and to
oiht!r tilt~y estriblis.hments, which the ' priests have
scattered ·about Lowe'r Canada. I will here a.ud, that
what they say about certain legislative enar.tments,
-re·quiring girls to be of a ·certain age' before "they can
take the· religious hllhit," and also that they sho•1ld
sig!l some kind of a deed, att~sted by otilers, &c., may
'be true, or untrue; none the more eithor way, how-

Miss Monk's representations of-that nunnery are ge_
n·
erally_
very correct. The subjoined statement is from
one who was there about three years. Her name is
suppressed for several reason!', all ~f which are justi-
-
fiable in her case. The fullest eredit, however, may
-
be reposed in her testimony, for she is a lady of char-
acter and standing; and a member of the Protestant
Episcopal Chul'ch. ·
"I was at the school in the Cougregational Nunnery

correct. I can't doubt for a moment but what she ,
bas been a scholar in the nunnery, as she states in her
book.
"The fact tl1at her descriptions of the Congregation-
al Nunnery are so correct, has alwayM led me to be-
lieve what she says of t~e H~tel Dieu ; though tlie
description is so awful t~at I am sometimes led t~
doubt its truth. But then when I recollect what I
have read, seen, and heard, of the character of Roman
prie~ts, my ~doubts vanish. I have thought a thou-
sand times of a remark that priest Larkin, who was
professor of Moral' Philosophy in the College at
Montreal, made to us one day in the public school-
room. It was this: he £~aid if he was able he would
hang every Prot_
estant there was on the-J.ace of the
earth. .Though I was a Ca,tholic then, 'my feelings
were ·shocked at such ·aremark."
Here it seems -
was Father Larkin, .although not the
chaplajn of the nu~nery, instru_
cting the young ladies,
and endeavoring to imbue their minds with the true
spirit of Romanism. ··

know. Public opinion rides over every law, both hu·
man and divirie.
Matters being thus, no evidence which the priests
or their advocates may offer in proof of an alibi, ought
to be received, unless it be of an unexceptionable
character. The reason is extremely obvious. The
momentous importnnce of the subject demands it ;'
and if it be true that Maria Monk has never been a
cloistered nun: it is an easy matter to produce such
evidence in proof of it. If Maria Monk was, as is
maintained, at service for ·some ten or eleven months
in Sorel, and some six months in St. Denis, and for
some fourteen or fifteen months a school mistress in·
the same place, at the very time she profes~es to have
been in ·the nunnery...:.it must be a niatter of public
notoriety. Hence there can be no difficulty in furnish-
ing unexceptionable testimony of the fact, if it be so.
Ought the testiino'ny of Roman Catholics, unsup-
ported by respectable Protestants, to be received as
such evidence 1 I answer, no. The reason is obvi·
ous. It is an established principle, acted on for ages
in the Catholic church, " that the end sanctifies the
meanB." And accor.ding to this principle, he is a
good Catholic that falsifies his word, if by so doing
he may thereby pr~mote a good end; and what end, .
in the eye of a faithful Catholic, is so precious as the .-.
honor of his· church 1 Among Catholics t~e priest-
hood constitutes the church. Hence every Roman
Catholic on earth is bound, by his religion, to defend ·
the.priMthood, right or wrong. No intelligent reader
of Catholic authors will dispute the truth of this posi-
tion. Let me not be .misunderstood ; I speak now·
with reference to n single point-that of defending ·.
the honor of the Romish church ; and I speak of

thoro~gb going Catholics, not nominal ones liviq
amidst intelligent Proteslants. ·
-. The first testimony presented to·us jn the- '.'Awful
Exposure," is that. of Charle~ Gouin, of Scrcl. '··He
states that Maria Monk was a servant girl in his fam·
ily, from the month of November, 1831, u~til Sep-
tember of thl! following year.. This testimony is
either true or false .: if true, it overthrows Maria
Monk's claims as an eloped .nun. That it is fal,e,. ,
th~re c:1n be no doubt. Mr.· Gouin is at~ted, by very
respec;:tabl~ nutho:-ity, to be a Roman Catholic-, so fr.r
as he has any rl'ligion. A. man notoriousl·y destitute
of moral principle; u bankrupt, owing mucb.and·pay•
ing little. He is descrit>ed by his own friend•, as.
"an active conspirator, un·worthy of confidence.."
Before pre~entiog counter testimony, l- wi::~h to put
my readers in possession of aU the· evidence which
the priests have fumished in .con.fi.nnatiou of Mr..
Goui-n's statement. A woman by tb.e name of M-ary
Angelica Monk, of Sorel, makes. qath.. th:lt Maria
Mon.k was in her ~eryice as a domestic, one week in
the autumn of 1832. She states that she uDclerstood
that Maria had been a .tsenant girl in the·family of
Mr. Gouin. 'Vho tqen is.this Mary Angelica Monk?
'Ve are told by the priest~, that she is not a relat-ive
of M~ria Monk; an(it is very certain, from respect-
able testimony received here, that her relationsMp
wquld be no honor,.either to- Maria Monk, or 'o any
other person. .She is an im]mre ''oman; having
been separated from her husbantl, on the ground of her
criminal connexion witb a man by thr name of Hall.

.The sta~ements of Mr. Gouin and Mrs. Monk, are
confirmed by t~e testimony of one Martel Paul Hut
Col!rnoier. The affidavit of this man has every
appe.arance of having been fabricated, for the t~ole
purpose of bolstering-up, not only the testimony of.·
Mr. Gouin and Mrs. Monk, but also that of othl'r in-
dividuals, to be examined hereaft('r. He is deseribed·
by tho~g .who know him;," ns nn illiterate fellow, who·
can neither rend nor .write; an active specula.tor, of
no property, little credit, reputation for virtue or ·in-
tegrity ; h;sving not long since debauched one of l.ii
own creed n.amed Couthnay." He was convicted or·
perjury in the case of the King against Isaae Jones·
and others, for ,the murder of Louis Marcoux. If any
man in Cana4a.doubt<J the truth of this, he i::~. refer-
red to the .legal registers of that Province, for the
proof of it. Such1 then, is the unprincipled charac- ·
ter of Martel Paul: and I ask, what confidene~ can
be ~eposed in the affidavit of such a perjured igno-
ramus1. '
Here, then, is the testimony adduced by the priest!!,
to prove that M4lria Monk,resided in Sorel, as a serv-
ant girl, for some ten or eleven months of the time
which she alleges herself to have passed in the Hotel ·
Dit>u, nunnery, of 1\lon~real. And that it is f\llse, is ,
evident (rom the following reasons:- , .-
1. The individuals thus testifying, have little or no
ch~uacter for veracity. 'fhis tbe pri~sts .well knew,
and they never would have rested their t"8use on
such testir:nony, if they could have procurt!d better.

ded for ten or eleven months in Sorel, the priests could

'-4 ft&PLT TO THE PRIESTS' BOOL
liam Henry, is a small place on the southeastern
back of the St. Lawrence river, containing about
fifteen hundred inhabitants, HO that each individual
of the town is generally known to every other.
Hence, if Maria Monk had been there, as is main-
tained by the priests, she would have been generally
known by the inhabitants of that village; and the
testimony of amy number could have been obtained.
2. Maria Monk declares that she never was in
Sorel ; and it is very evident that she is altogether
ignorant of the place, except what 1he knows froin
mere report. Before she ba4 seen Dr. Robertson's
affidavit in Nov. 1835, she was examiiled with refer-
ence· to her knowledge of Sorel, and it was evident
that she knew nothing about it. I took special Jlains
to ascertain, befoi·e she knew any thing ofthe priests'
attempt to prove that she had resided in Sorel, whether
she knew tb~ir witnesses. She evidently bad never
heard of Mr. Gouin, and Mr. Paul ; but of Angelica
!Monk she had ~ome knowledge, as she had formerly
resided near her mother's, in Montreal. ···
.3. All the multiplied and. varied evidence 'of her
having been a nun, hereafter to be offered to the read-
er, proves that the testimony of these witnesses is
false.
4. Mr. Buttery, a reputable merchant of Sorel, was
in New York in June or July last, and called upon
Maria Monk. This was before -the priests' book
madti its appearance, but Doctor Robertson, of Mon-
treal, had given it as his opinion, formed on mere
hearsay testimony, that she had reside~, during the
suiLmer of 1832, in Sorel. Special pains, t.herefore,
were taken to ascertain whether Mr. Buttery ' and

ed in that place. . Mr. Buttery lives near Mr. Gouin's;
nnd would of course have seen her, had she lived
tl1ere for ten,months.
5..The follo-wing testimony of Mr. John Ed'ler, of
Ne\V York, is decisive on the p.oint. Mr. Edler first
became .~cquainted with Maria Monk' some time iii
the summer of 1836, in the city of New Yorl,.. Hill
statement is as follows:-
" I have fr.iends, a grand-parent ,and a brotht>r, ·re-
.siding in S9rel or·WHliam Henry., whom I have fre-
qllently. yis~ted . in that place. My mother resided
there !,)efor.e her 11eccase. I am·personally acquaint-
ed with Mr. Charles Gouin and his iumily, who keep
:1 tavl.'rn.in Sorel. Their r~sidence is in the imm~di­
ate vicinity of my relattves. On one occasion I re-
side~ with my t~onne.xions i·n Sore~ for about the
space of nine months, immediately preceding the
co~rnencement of ~he Cholera in July, 1832. Du-
ring this period I was often at 1\ir. Gouin's, and .per- ·
son~lly knew the ~embe~s of his household ; an·d
I am , very certain .that Maria Monk, authoress of.
the '~ Awful Disclosures," ~vas not, during tbis period
of time, a member of Mr.. Gouin's family, in. any,·
sense whatever. Nor did I ever hearof her living in·
So,rel, un~il I recently heard of it in New: York. I.
first. became acquainted with Maria Monk in New
Ycrk, some three or four months since." ·
Mr~ ·~.dler's testimony covers eight out or the ten
months: during which time, Mr. Gouiu says, that,
46 REPLY TO TIIF. PRttsTS' BOOK:.
Maria Monk 'vas a menial in his family. Mr. E.Jier,
so far as I have been able to ascertain, i's a young
gentleman ·of veracity and industr)·· His statement,
therefore, can be relied on as true.
· Since writing the abov~, a lady from Sorel has
visited· Mar!a Monk in New York. And she gives
it as her decided optnion, that the authoress of thta
"Awful Disclosures" has never been a resident of
Sorel,·'as testified by the priest:J' witnesses. ·Thus
the evidence, that Charles Gouin, Martel Paul Hus
Cournoier, and Angelica Monk, ·have given false tes·
timony, is constantly augmenting. ··~ . ·
It is evident, therefore, that Maria Monk, authoress
of the "Awful Disclosures,".has not resided in Sorel,
aa maintained by the priests and· iheir·perjured· sup-
porters. It seems, however, that a· pE'rson assuming
the name of Mnria Monk, did reside at Mr. Gouin's
in Sorel, at the time specified. A gentle'man of char-
acter and standing, who appears to have faitlifully
examined the- matter, writes as follows:-" From all
then that I can ascertain..:...and it is in the mind of
others-1 suspect that a ·JJ.Iar1:a Monk was made by
the priests aod nuns of Montreal, in anticipation of
what should follow from the disclosures of the true
Maria Monk after leaving the .convent." This is a
right priestly trick.....what the venerable 'Baxter would
denominate "Jesuit juggling." Who min fathom the
depths of- their deceptive' ·workings-prophetically
called by the Apostle Paul, " the deceitfulness of all
unrighteousness 1" The arts of deception have been
eul~ivated by them, now, for more than on~t thousand
years. .

ing March, about six months. There is somethin~
worthy of special notit~e in this woman's affidavit.

Monk. What is the m~aning, in this ~annexion of
the compound word so-called 1 Does it not look as
if the priests or their agents had so called some ser-

ble; especially. in a country to\vn, in the heart of the
summer, when the business of the farmer is most ur-
.gent. Moreover, hi~ s.tatemcnt t~1at he was rcquest.ed
by Maria Monk, to wnte tu LoUise Bousq,let and m-
form her, that if she would come to Montreal she
should receive two hundred pounds currency, is so
absurdly false as to show that little or no confidence
can be put in whatever he may say.
Another witness is Martel Paul Hus Cournoier.
He states that he lmcw of Maria Monk residing in
St. Denis; but he does not tell us when it was. The
worthless character of this man has been already
noticed.
The only remaining testimony to be examined is
that of Louise Bousquet.
Maria 1\Ionk states in her Disclosures, that while a
novice in the Hotel Dieu, she became displeased, and
left the convent and went to St. Denis, and engaged
as an assistant teacher in the Government school to
Louise Dousqaet. She states that she remuined with
Miss Dousquet about three months, and then returned
to the convent. Miss Bousquet testifies to the fact,
that Maria Monk was at one time in her employment,
as au assistant teacher. 'rhere is, therefore, an agree-
ment between them, as to the fact, that they were
once associated together as instructresses of children
~n .St. Denis; but in every thing else they disagree.
Miss Bousquet contradicts every statement that
~aria Monk has made in her book, which is in any
way connected. with her, except it be the one just
.noticed. .The only point of importance, however, re··
.
spects the ti~nc when Miss Monk was associated with
he_
r, as te~cher in St. Denis. Miss Bousquet affirms
~at it was from December, 1833, till July: 1834,-tbe

very time when Miss Monk declares that she was a
nun in the Hotel Dieu. There are two things in
Miss Bou!quet's affidavit, which ~specially gh·e to
her testimony the appcurunCl' of fabrication: 1. The
fact that she dP.nies all Miss Monk's stat~ments re-
specting her, some of which nre of no importaqcr,
with the single exception of the one that they were
ft!lsociated together in teaching !chool. This looks
like art, not like the utt~rings of simple nature or
truth. She does not contradict Miss Monk's state-
ments in the gross, but in the detail, one nfter another.
2; Her statement that she recch·ed two letters in the
month of August, 1835, one in English, signed
"Hoyte," which she "remained ignorant of bt•cause
she could not read English:" the other in French,
signed "Ambroise Vigeaut," which invited h~r to go
to Montreal and receive two hundred pounus curren-
cy, "which a lady in Montreal was commissioned to
give her." She tells us that she proceeded to .Mon-
treal, and call~d nn Ambroise Vigeaut, who informed
her that the lady was Maria Monk. Si e then called
on Maria's mother, "who in an angry manner burned
the letters on the spot," saying " that her daughter
was a victim and an unfortunate." Now the mean-
ing of all this is, that Mr. Hoyt and Miss Monk wish.-
ed to bribe her, with two hundred pounds currency, to
testify that Maria Monk had been a nun in the Hotel
Dieu-thus insinuating that a vile conspiracy had
been formed against the nunnery. This .is known,
however, to be absolutely false, for Miss Monk com-
municated her principal statements respecting the
Hotel Dieu, before she ever saw or heard of Mr.
Hoyt; as will be seen hereafter. Besides, Mr. Hoyt and
Miss Monk were poor, not being worth the tythe of two

hundred pounds cunency. How then could they oJTer

~Vould they hnve offered her two hundred pJunds,
curl'ency, when the fiftieth part woi1ld have answered
rvery purpose 7 "\Voultl they have sent her a l~tter

posed themselves to detection 1 Would they have
41mployed Ainhroisc Vigcaut to make her the offer in

nnd thus have kept him out of the secret 1 'rhe whole
affair is almmJ ancl false. Of what value then is the
testimony of Louise Bousquet, and of Ambroise Vi-
geaut '1
Thus we have reviewed all the evidence which the
priests have produced, to prove that Maria Monk resi-
ded nt St. Deni~, from October, 1832, until July, 1834.
Setting aside the fact, that all the witne~ses are Catho-
lics, the mere tooh of the priests, their testimony
bears internal marks offnbl'ication. Had Maria Monk
resided twenty-one months in St. Denis, how easy a
matter for the priests to adduce such proof of the fact,
ns would remove every reasonable doubt on the sub-
ject!
The inhabitants of St. Denis arc nearly all of them
Catholics. Her.cc the difficulty of obtaining any tes-
timony fr.om that place, which wo11ld be favorable- to
Miss Monk's claims, and which would, as a matter
of course, militate against the cause of the priests.
Even the few Protestants there, are so intimately con-
nected with the Catholics, that they cannot do any
thing on the subject, without securing to themselves
consequences highly disagreeable. I wrote to a gen-
tleman of that town, rcc1uesting his assistance in the

matter; and the following is an extract from his re-
ply:-" I am sorry to. say I am unable to meet with
your views, as I eilnnot give you any infot·mation re-
specting her (Maria Monk) from personal knowledge;
and I must at the same time pcsiti·vely decline making
the inquiries you desired me to make, as 'it might,
and 1could lead to consequences highly disagreeable
to myself hereafter." I would here obser\'C that such
is the sittJation of this gentleman, that if Maria Monk
had resided in St. Denis, as maintained hy the prlests
and sworn to by their vassals, he must have had some
"personal knowledge" of her.
, Another serious difficulty with which I have met
in attempting to secure such an inve1;t!gation of the
matter) as I have wished, has been the interception of
letters,· as I suppose in the Post-office at ·Montreal.
Since receiving the one, from which an extract is giv-
en above, I have written sc\'erallctters to gentlemen
in Montreal on the subject, which appear never to
have been received, by those to whom they were ad-
dressed. I do not say who has·done this. I simply
state a fact, and leave my readers to make their own
iriferen'ces.
The following statement, as will be seen, is direct-
ly to ihe point. - It i3 presented without bdng sworn
to, and without the young man's signature. It is
proper that I should state the reawn of this. It is
simply the fact, that all his friends are Catholics, and
of courge unwilling that he should do any thing to
establish the truth of Maria Monk's claims. A short
time since I had an interview with him, when he v,ery
readily communicated to ine the facts contained in this
statement. At that time he was uncertain, \vhether

l831, that Maria Monk was assistant tt>acher to Louise
Bousquet in St. Denis ; but he thought, howt>ver, he
could a!lcertain by examining hi~ papers, This he
agreed to do, and to call on me the Saturday follow-
iog·-it being on Monday we had the interview.
During the intervening time, I arranged tbe facts
which he communicated to me, leaving n blank for
dates to be filled when he should call according to his
agreement; when I expected that be would confirm
the whole on oath. Saturday arrived, but he did not
call, as he engaged to do. During the following
week, I engaged a gentleman to visit .him in Brook-
lyn, and have him fill the blanl' dates, correc.t any
errol which might exist i~ the statement, and confirm -~
it befote a magistrate. The gentleman called on him
and read to him the statement, but he declined tc con-
firm it on oath, or to have his name published in con- '
nexion with it, as that would offend his friends in
Canada, and he felt himself to be among strangers
here. He stated that he had received a letter from
his brother, stating that it was in the summer of 1833,
that Mal'ia Monk was in St. Denis. I have been thus
particular ·in detailing these facts, in order that the
public may be enabled to judge in the matter. Th~
statement that Maria Monk was connectetl with
Louise Bousquet's school m the su111mer of 1833, con~
tradicts all the testimony which the priests have pro-
ducer! on the subject. Louise Bousquet, as we have
seen, testifies that it was in the summer of 1834.
This C~nadian tampt>ring dot!s not help the matter.
The statement, therefore, is given, with the date as

·"A. V., now a resident of Brooklyn city, State ~f
New York, having been duly sworn, doth depos~ and
say: · ·
"I was botn and brought up in St. Denis, Lower
Canada, ·where most of my relatives still live. I am
acquainted ,with Maria Monk, authoress of 'Awful ..
Disclosures.' I first became 'acquainted with her in
the year of 1830, or 183~, in St. Denis. She was then
an. assistant teacher, as I understood, in the Govern~
ment school, taught by one Louise Bousquet. She was
frequently at my mother's house, as my three brothers
younger tha'n myself attended he'r school, two. of
whom ~he prepared for their first communion. 'Aftex
she had been residing for several weeks in St. Denis;
I left home, and went to reside for two months in
Montreal. When I ret•1rned home in the latter par\.
of·the ·summer, 1 inquired for the little English girl,
as 've used to call ht:r, and was informrd by my-
m'other and others that she had left St. Denis. Af-
ter this I never knew nor heard any thing asto'where
sllJ was, unti~ after she published her 'Disclosure's'
in New 'York. And further deponent saith: I know
Michael Gurrtin, Jean Baptiste Laflamme dit Timi-
netir, and Angelica·~-todji ns, widow of the late An- ,
thony Gazaille dit St. Germain, all of. St. Denis.
They reside in the neighborhood of my mother'~ ·I~:li­

thefr families, eithe'r as a senant girl or as a ~chool
mi~tress, during any part of the yeurs ]832 and 1833,

of it until published m a book called 'Awful Exp~ ·

Three things are rendered very clc'ar by this man's '
testimony :~1st, ·That Maria 1\Jonk was in St. Denis
but a short time, a~ stated in her "Disclosures." 2d,
That' during this tiine she was connected with Lou-
ise Bousq~Jet's r-chool. · 3d, That she was not connect- ·
ed with 1 the families before mentioned. And · thus·
her account of ·her ·residence in St. Denis, is · con·-
firmed.
We ate told that Maria Monk proceeded directly
frc:-r, St.- Denis to Montreal, and entered into the ser-
vice of Charles D. S..Lovis, where ·she remained ·
from the 12th of July, 183,!, until" the 7th or 8th of
the following month. Mr. Lovis testifies that, while
she was' in his family, "she was often deranged in 1
her mid ;" and that she expressed a wish "to be-
come c. ' •man Catholic, and be baptized." Mr. •
Lovis is "' £: ~man Catholic, and his testimony is to
be received as such. 'fhe following statement of
Mr. Jones, one of the publishers of the "Awful Ex- ·
posure," made at the interv-iew which he and ·his
coadjutor, Mr. 'Le Clerc, had with Miss ·Monk, in
New York," on the· 17th of August, 1836, does much ~
toward~ overthrowing the affidavit of Mr. Lovis :-•
"Mr. Lovis, of Montreal, told me· that M~ria Monk
left his service in July, 1834; and about that time
Fanny Johnson came to live with us. She stayed
with ·u!ll a~out a week,·and was dismi~3ed on account
of her negligent habits. She answered the descrip-··
tion given br. Mr. Lavis so well, and having decHll'ed•
that she came from· Mr. Lovis', I was strongly .ini-'
pressed with the belief that they were the same per·.
son. 1 But·now I.see..my mistake. You (Miss ~onk)
t'·
l)8 REPLY TO THE PRIESTS' BOO!t,
are .llot Fanny Johnson." There is no doubt but that
if' Mr. Lavis, (provided he is an honest man,) &hould
see Miss Monk, he would also see his mistake, and
see that hi& Maria Monk was Fanny Johnson, or
some other person.
That the affidavit of Mr. Lavis is false, I have not
the least doubt. 1. '\.Yc have seen that Ma_
ria Monk
did not come to his house directly from St. Denis, in
July, 1834; for it is evident that she was not in St.
Denis during that year. 2. The above statement of
Mr. Jon~s is enough to show that Maria Monk was not
in his service; but that it was one Fanny Johnson.
3. Mr. Lavis' declaration that "she was often de·
ranged in her mind," during the three ·or. four weeks,
that, he says, she was in his service, is evidently un-
true of Maria Monk, and is enough in itself to show
that his testimony is unworthy of the least confi-
dence. They tell us that she was a teacher in the
Goverument school for a long time, imm~diately pre·
ceding this; and would a deranged per~on have been
thmJ employed 1 Besidos, she has evinced no syni(r
t.oms of derangement during her residence in New
York, for the last year and a half. Doctor Robert·
son, of Montreal, who examined her hands some
three months afterwards, states in his affidavit, that
"From the appearance of her hands, she evidently
had not been used to work." It is very manifest
from the whole appearance and conduct of Miss
Monk, that she has never been a servant gi~l· in any
family. This is the decided opinion of the families,
1n which she has resided since she came .to New
York. Hence the affidavits of Mr. Gouin, and Mrs.
Angelica Monk, of Sorel, and of Mrs. St. Germain,
of St. Denis, and Mr. Lovis, of Montreal, all of them

testifying, that she has been at service in their fami-
lies,-are undoubtedly false.
We have next a statement from one Lawrence
Kidd. T hh consists of a conversation which ·he had
sometime in the su:nmer of 1834, with Capt. Ryan,
"master of a st<.~amer." Mr. K!dd ~tate!-~ that "Capt.
Ryan toid him that Monk had journeyed on board
his boat from Sorel to Montreal ;" and that he
had lost his watch, and that he suspected tHat
"Monk" had stolen it.-The priests think that this
must h:wc been after she left the service of Mr.
Lovis. Bnt what does it a11 amount to? Mr. Kidd
says, that Mr. Ryan told him thus and thus. And
who is Capt. Ryan? He i~ a miserable atheist;
ejected, on account of his vile atheism, from his of-
fice, by the government authorities. Of what value
then is his idle tale?
vVe are furnisbed in the next place with a long
affidavit from one Louis Malo, ·a constable of Mont-
real. He tells us that in October, 1834, he arrested
Maria Monk for stealing-" that on account of her
youth, and the respectability of her family,:' the man
from whom she st.ole declined proBecuting her-and
that he, taking pity on her, took her to a taYern, where '
he kept her two or three days-and that a few days
afterwards, being sent for by.her, he saw her again at
another tavern-and that the next time he saw her
was in September, 1835, when she, being in a house
of ill-fame, sent for him, and told him that she had
come to Montreal from Ncw'York, with Mr. Hoyt,
with whom she had left his (Malo's) child, at
Goodenough's tavern. It is in this way that thi~
co.nte~ptible creature, aided by the priests, wishes to

tell the world that he 1" the father of Maria l\'fonk's
child. Thus he glories in his own sh~me.
A full delineation of this man's character would
pollute ev~n pollution itself. I c1ust, therefore, b~
excused from the loathsome task of even attempting it.
I will only say, that he is considt ~~d by all who know
him, as the greatest of blackguards, a perfect paragon
of immorality, a man dcstitut~ of veracity, whose
oath, unsupported by others, even Mr. Jones himself
admitted in New York, wa!l worthy of no confidence.
He owns some two or three houses in one of .the
Montreal suburus, all devoted to the goddess of in-
famy, himself being the presiding genius over each
of them. '\'Vbat confidence, then, can possibly be
placed in this man's affidavit-an atlidavit covering
some two or three pages of detail, all of which bear
the marks of sheer fabrication? 'rhus I will take my
leave of Louis Malo, with the simple remark~ that
his affidavit appears to h~ve · becn fabricated by the
priests or their agents, for the single purpose of find-
ing a father for Maria Monk's child, other than priest
Phelan, of Montreal, on whom she had sworn it.
Maria Monk professes to have eloped from the
Hotel Dieu nunnery in the early part of November,
1834. The priests say, that she left the service of
Mr. Lovis on the 7th or 8th of August, of the same
year. There is, therefore, some three months inter-
vening between the two points of time-from the time
she is said to have left Mr. Lavis' until the time she
professes to have escaped from the convent. Where
was she during these three months 1 The priests
tell us that " she took up her habitation in various
brothels, at Griffin Town, a suburb of Montreal,.and
elsewhere." They do not pr.

Can any man believe, after examining the subject,
that the priests ha\·e.given.us a true account of Maria
Monk's residence during the time specified 1 Where
then was she during this time 1 Before answering
this question, we must examine the statement of
Doc:tor Nelson. He says:-" That when I was the
medical attendant of the Hotel Dieu hospital, and
occasionally of the convent, which is the cloistered
part of the establishment, I never once saw Miss
Monk there; but more than once, at her mother's re-
quest, I saw her at the Government housekeeper's
apartments, which are those occupied by her mother."
On page 184, Awful Disclosures, Maria Monk states ··
that she frequently attended Dr. Nelson in his visits
to the public hospital, and wrote down his prescrip-
tions, &c. One or other of them: therefore, must be
mistaken, or a wilful dec-eiver. The doctor's state-
ment consi'sts of two parts :-1. He denies ba,•ing
11een her in the nunnery. This may be true, and yet
she may have been there, and he not have known her in
her nun's apparel as b~ing Miss Monk, though he
must in that case have known her as Saint Eustace,
the name by whi~h she was called in the convent.

2. He says that by her. mother's request, he saw her
more tha,n once at her mother's house. The question
is, when did he thus repeatedly see her at her mo-
ther's house 1 Was it during the time she professes
to have bee~ in the nunnery 1 The docto•·'s dcdara-
tion is equivocal, and I fear designedly so. If he le·
peatedly saw her at 'her mother's request, at her resi-
dence, she must have been sick there. Now, i'fthe doc-
tor's declaration, that he more than once saw her at her
mother's hou<5c, means any thing to the point, it means
that he sa\v her there during the time she professes to
have been a nun in the Hotel Dieu. But the priests
have professedly proved, that she lived during thi~
time, in Sorel, St. Denis, Ml'. Lavis', and in the Griffin
Town brothel~.~ How could she have lived in these
places, and at the same time be sick at her mother's
house, under the care of Dr. Nelson 1 Let Dr. Nel-
SOQ. and the priests explain this, if they can, for it is
more than I can c,omprehend. One thing, however,
is certain, viz. that Dr. Nelson's testimony either
proves no alibi from the nunnery, or else an alibi from
Sorel and St. Denis.
However skilful Dr. Nelson may ~.le as a physician,
his veracity appears to be, especially on this subject,
at a very low ebb. He is or has been physician to
the nuns. The priests call him a Protestant; but he
is not. a Protestant, but a professed ridiculer of all re·
ligion. He keeps a mistress ; and, according to the
.statement of Maria Monki his conduct when in the
nunnery is very little better than that of the priests.
His ..d.eclaration, therefore, that he never saw Mis~

The testimony of Dr. Robertson and Mrs. Mo~k~
Maria's mother, re-presented in the "Awful Expo·
sure," has b~en for a long time before the public. It
amounts to little or nothing on the question, whether
or no Miss Monk has been'an inmate in the nunnery.
Dr. Robertson expresses his opinion from hear say
testimony, that Maria Monk was in Sorel and St.
Denis, during a greater part of the time she profess·
es to h1ve been in the nunnery. I suppose the priests
or their agents told him so. Mrs. Monk states that, ,.
in conversation with certain gentlemen, she told them
that her daughter had never been in the nunnery.
'fhe long affidavit of Mrs. Monk is a mere farce,
never confirmed by her. Hence it has not her signa-
ture. It was fabrieated under the direction of the
priests, who obtained a ·promise from her that she
would not contradict its statements. But if this were
not so, still we have the affidavit of Mr. William
Miller, who testifies that Mrs. Monk told him in the
summer of 1833, that her daughter Maria was then
in the nunnery: Awful Disclosures, page 237. The
reader may judge at which time she told the truth.
At the time she stated the fact to Mr. Miller, she was
under no temptation to tell an untruth.~ But not so
in August, 1835, when 'she says that she told certain
'individuals, that her daughter had never been in the
nunnery. Besides, Mr. Jones expressly declared i'n
New York, in August, 1836, that the affidavit of
Mrs. Monk was now considered as injurious to their
cause, and that its first publication was regretted.
The affirmations of the Montreal tribe of Magda·
lens are beneath contempt. They affirni.tbat, ·in t~e
winter of 1834-5, Maria Monk told them of. her resi-
ding in Sorel, St. Denis, &c., b•Jt never intimated to

them an)· thing respecting her having been a nun in
the Hotel Dieu. Admitting all they say on this sub-
ject were trlJe, however, it would amount simply to
this, that Miss Monk, for the sake of her own safety,
practised deception upon them a~ to the fact of her
having eloped from the convent. But who has any.
confidence in this fictitious tribe ofMagdnlens 1 Well
did Mr. Jones, publisher of the "Awful Exposure,"
say to me in New York, that many of his witnesses
could not bE'! found, and that I should need his assist-
ance to find them. Some of these Magdalens have
been searched for, but lo, they were not to be found !
Respecting thi3 manwuvre of the prie~ts, I shall have
occasion to remark more at length hereafter. Suffice
it to say, that the priests could never have expected to
gull . anybody with this Magdalen trick, except it
were such as "love darkness rather than light."
These Magdalens and Louis Malo are at direct antip·
odes in their affidavits. They affirm that he had in-
tercourse with Maria Monk, during the winter of
1834·5, in the yard of the Asylum. He affirms that
he never heard of her from October, 1834, until Sept.
1835.
This completes our review of the documentary tes-
timony presented by the priests, to prove an alibi in
the case of Maria Monk-that she resided elsewhere
than in the nunnery, during the time she professes to
have been a nun in that establishment. What tben
is the result 1 Have the priests succeeded in their
attempt to prove an alibi 1 So far as the number of
statemen.ts and affidavits are.Jconcerned, their is no

sonal knowledge, there is not a single Protestant \Vif·
nen, unless it be the notoriously profligate Mary An-
gelica Monk-the intimate friend of Kelly, the most
licentious priest there is in Canada. Not a single un·
exceptionable witness is to be found among thero.
I wish my rcader3 to remember, ho.w easy a matter
it ~s to prove an alibi in Maria Monk's case, provided
she hag never been a nun in the Hotel Dicu. If she
lived about one yP.ar in Sorel, and about one year and
a half in St. Denis, ns maintained by the priests, how
easy a matter it would have been to prove it, by un- .
exceptionable witnesses 1 If true, why pre~ent to us
as witnesses, such unprincipled characters as Martel
Paul, Charles Gouin, Angelica Monk, &c.'? The
very fact, that the priests have been unable to furnish
nny better testimony, after the labor of so may months,
is in itself evidence of the t.lesperatcmess of their un-
dertaking. I beg of my readers to 1;onder well this
particular point, for it is of grl'at importance in the
controversy. "When I take into consideration all the
circumstances of the case-the length of time which
the priests have had to collect evidence-the fact
that Maria Monk is said to have liver! for two years
and a half in the hvo places specified-the fact that -
the mass of the people in these two towns are favora-
ble to the priestB, and of coursP., decidedly. hostile to
Miss Monk's claims-and above all, when I consider
its immense importance to the priests; that upon it
is suspended the strength of their defence; and then
look at the testimony adduced-! feel constrained to
say that, in my judgment, the priests and their
agents have utterly failed ·in their attempt to pro'l'e
an alibi.

It is perfectly proper to I'Cmark further, that ·aueb
an attempt, in such a case, thus resulting in iJl-suc-

FRoM the time of her visit to Montreal, in August,
1835, Maria Monk, in confirmation of the fact that
she had been an inmate of the Hotel Dieu, appealed _,
to an impartial examination of that convent-staking
the truth of her claims to public confidence on the
result of such an examination. She thus ch:...l! ~oged
her opponents to test the matter by a fair tribuna).
This challenge the friends of the priests pretend to
say, has been accepted, because on the fifteenth day
of July, 1836, they subjected the nunacry to the ex-
amination of a few individuals, as a committee, ap-
pointed by themselves for that purpose. But before
receiving the report of this committee, as deciding
6*

the point in controversy, several things should be dis-
tinctly noticed.
1. The time which elapsed from the period she
left the convent, until the day the examination was
made.. Sbe professes to have eloped..from the nun;
n~ry in the early part of 'Novemb~r, 1S:3'4, an4 the
exam.ination took place in July, 1836. Thus about
one. year and. eight months. intervened between th~
points of time. A period of time more than sufficient
to haverehuilt the nunnery, if they had been so di~-
posed. · ·
2. She first made her appeal to this test in the Au-
gust of 1835; ·so that eleven months intervened, be-
, fore the pretended examination of it was made.
3. It was announced in the public prints in Octo-
ber, 1835, that men were employed in making altera-
tions in the Hotel Dieu ; so that this announcement.,
uncontradicted, was before the public about nine
months, prior to the ·examination. On page 63, ·of
her book, which \vas published in the following Janu-
ary, Miss 1\'lonlr makes the same charge in the3e
words:-" And.I have been credibly info1med1 that
masons have been employed in the nunnery 'since [
left it." Such a.:ssurances she had while in Montreal,
as well as since her return to New York.
So much in reference to time for making altera-
tiuns. ' The nt.>xl thing worthy of notice, is the ap-
pointment and character of the committee, who made
the examin;:~.tion. In the ,appointment o~ this com-
mittee, neither Maria MC!nk, nor her.friends, had any
voice whatever. It wns chosen exclusively by her
.~~owed enemies. Mr. Jones, the agent nf the priests,

justice, I would ..gladly pass. them over in mute si·

taken, and·the tremendous responsibility which they

I remark, then, that one and all of them have, from .•
the commencement of the coutrover~y: been the de-
cided opponents of Maria Monk. Mr. Jones, the os-
tensible leader in all the movements which have been
made to vindicate the criminated priests-avows him-
self to be a Roman Catholic, though hr. is understood
to be, by those who lmo1" him, an infidel-a man in
whose word, little or no confidence can be placed.
He dec~ared in NElw York, in the presence of several
gentl.:!men, .that he published the first article that was-.

general characters of the Rev. Messrs. Perkins and
Curry, I have nothing to say, but what is praisewoz-
thy of them. As ministers of Christ, they have the
general confidence of the Christian eo01munity. But,
unfortunately, both for themselves and the cause of
truth, they have been led to pursue a. course, in refer-
ence to the controversy between Miss Monk and the
priests, which appenrs to me, every enlightened and
unprejudiced man must unhesitatingly ecmdemn. It
is known, that, from the first, they have, in their let-
ters, and in their conversation, been active in oppo-
sing the claims of Maria Monk. Being early prejudiced .
against her, they took a decided stand in their oppo-
sition; and thus becoming partisans, they have been
goaded on from step to step in vindication of their
own conduct. I speak advisedly on this subject, and
with no other feelings, than those of kindness to--
wards these gentlemen.
The origin and growth of their prejudice can be
easily tract:>d. Miss Monk went in company with
Mr. Hoyt, from New York to Montreal, to procure a
·legal investigation of her charges against the priests.
An unhappy di.fferenre existed between Mr. Perkins
and Mr. Hoyt, who had been residing for some time
previous in and about Montreal, as an agent for some
benevolent societies. This fact, connected wilh the
circumstance that Mr. Hoyt was a member of the
Free Presbyterian church of that city, and was espe-
cially befriended in the object of his visit, by its lead-
ing members, who had gone off from Mr. .Perkins'
church, very much against his wishes, gave to the
subject astrong party character, and thus awakened
the prejudice of that gentleman, against the cause
which his opponents had espoused. Had Miss Monk

fallen into other, hands, it is probable Mr. Perkin:;·
would never have occupied the unnatu!'al position in
which he now presents himself~ to the astonishment .,
of the Protestant public. His position is not the re-
sult of any friendship which hE' Ieels towards priests,
nuns, and t.heir religion. Popery in all its forms he
abominates.
It was evident from an early date, to those whu
were investigating ;Miss Monk's case, in New York,·
that he was under strong excitement: for he replied
only in terms of passion to arespectful letter address-
ed to him, for information on the subject.
Mr. Curry, having then but recently arrived in
Canada, and being intimately associated with Mr.
Perkins, was, amidst the general unpopularity of
Miss Monk's cause, easily led to array himself against
her claims; and the sarcastic tone of his ,letter sta-·
tipg the results of his examination of the Convent
exhibit$ the violence of his prejudice. He has since
been serving the cause of the priests, however much
he may dislike their religion. The first intimations
received in New York, respecting Maria Monk's hav~.
ing described the Montreal Magdalen Asylum, in-
stead of the Hotel Dieu nunnery-a .fiction of recent
date-were connected with his movements. He \'las
represented as. searching the builJing, and applying
the test; and Mr. Jones, in the presence of the Edi-
tors of the New York Sun, declared to the writer of
thi~, on his (Mr. C.'s) authority, that he (Mr. C.)
found ¥aria Monk's plan to be an exact fac-simile of
the interior of that Asylum I!
Such, then, were the qualifications of the examining
committee. A1,1d that I have not misjudged in the
matter, I feel quite confident; especially in reference

to the Rev. Mr. Perkins,-whose opinion is perhaps
considered to be the most important of any in. the
committee-for I have severnlletten from him, which
abundantly evince the imbittered state of Ais feelings
on this subject.*
One word respecting tlie time occupied in examin-
ing the nunnery. The building is a huge aft1ir. Ac-
cording to Bouchette's Topographical Description of
Lower Canada, it is 324 feet in front, on St. Paut
street, by 468 feet in depth, on St. Joseph'Street. Now
Mr. Jont>~> declared in Ne\v York that the committee ·
were occupied only between two and three hours in
making their examination, "from garret to. ceJJar."
· This being the case, it is impossi-ble-that the examina-
tion could have been any thing like a thorough one;
S.uch being the circumstances of the case, it may
be asked, what hu: an unfavorable report could be
expected, by the friends o.f Miss Monk, from such
a commitlee 1 But let us examine the report itself~
and see what it amounts to. It is professedly written

and without senc.Jing any prt:vious notice, visit said
nunnery," &c. He goes on to state that he e~amined
-every Jhi~g "from the cellar to the roof," out-houses
and all, except the cloistered department ; and that
the lady Superior and the nuns, to whom h:
e was in-
troduced, offered him every facility ; and that he was
assured by one ofthem" that if they had had timely no-
tice of his visit, .a permit from the bishop would have
been obtained to give him immediate access to the
whole of the cloistered department." Now the im-
pression t.hat all this is adapted to make is, thut Mr.
Curry's visit was unexpected to the nuns, and that
they and their lady Superior earnestly courted an ex-
amination of their convent. But be it known that
N. B. Doucet andJ. P. Lacroix, Esquires, Mr. Curry's
•~tssclci'a in his adventure, are Roman Catholics,
and great friends of the priests ; and Maria Monk de-
that they are habitual visiters of the Hotel
Dieu, for the same purpose ·tha:t the prie3ts visit that
house of ill-fame. Hence the probability is, that the
iests, nuns, and their two comrades, had the matter
"cut and 'dried," ~~-- order that they might make
experiment, and see ho\V far they could mislead
Curry; and thus judge whether they might PJU·
admit a committee, in part under his general-
to e_
xplore the nunnery. It appears that the ex-
• .n::ruuent succeeded just as rhey would have ir. In
exploration, Mr. Curry found nothing that bore
resemblan_
ce, as he tells us, to Maria Mouk's de-
~oo""'"'t''"" • This may be called the first part of the

and the examination made. The result was the same
as before with Mr. .Curry; the committee "were
unable to discover the remotest resemblance between
any part of said building, an" the plan or description
of Maria Monk." Maria's name was not to be found,
cither in ." the register of deaths," or in " the register
in which are entered the names, ages, and dates of
the taking the veil of each nun." No trace of her
was to be found; not even the names of those men-
tioned in her disclosures.
This report of the committee is all negatives. The
committee tell us that they repeatedly traversed every
section of the nunnery," and could find nothing re·
sembling Maria Monk's descriptions. But they do
·not tell us what they did find'; whether a greater or
less 'number of rooms, than she mentions in her de-
scriptions. W c are thus left to grope our \vay in all
the darkness of negatives... ·
In a letter from the Rev.-Mr. Perkin~, written im·
mediately after the examination took place, he in·
forms the writer of these pages, that Maria "has pla·
ced the cloistered part of the establishment where the
kitchen is : a~d that the who~e concem is turned up·
side down." It appears from this statement, and
frt>m a conversation which I had with Mr. Jones,
confirmed by the testimony of Mr. Ostell, that the
cloistered part of the Hotel Dieu nunnery, is not, at
present, the rear central wing of that building; as de·
scribed by Maria Monk. Thtl truth iS, that· amidst
the changes and alterations which pave taken place
in that convent, since she left it, the nuns' depart·

does not, in ·her published writings, attempt to de-
scribe the present habitation of the nuns.
From Mr. Jones, I learned that that part of the
building described by Miss Monk, is now occupied as
a kitchen, sleeping-rooms for servants, storage-rooms,
aplace for old rubbish, &c. &c. How easy, then, to
mislead and bewilder such a committee, hastening
through the nunnery as they must have done, seeing
they despatched their search in so short· a time!-
Since the report of the committee, some of Miss
Monk's friends hnve attempted to examine this part
of the building, and have been peremptorily excluded.
Why is this 1 My readers can easily conjecture.
Before leaving this exp.arte report of the commit-
tee, two things mentioned in it, deserve a passing
notice. First, speaking of the register of names, Mr.
Curry says: :'To ascertain whether this was the real
register, I:r.alled for, the name of & nun with whom I
had become acquainted about one year sinl·e, and was
immediately referred to it. In this record, which was ·"
an old book, there were no erasures, no mutilations.
We searched for the name of Maria Monk, and others
mentioned in her book; no such names were·there."
Now this looks·like a piece of accomplished Jesuitism
on the part of the priests and nuus. Who knows but
this book may have been prepared with said namet,
f~r the·express purpose of decep,tion1 Mr. Curry hu
said, in conversation, t~at l;le was expressly reques~ '
ed by the mother of said DUll to make iuquiriea re.-:

~~ REPLY TO THE PRIESTs' BOOE.
1pecting her daughter. It was therefore known before-
laand that Mr. Curry would inquire for her. Or, per-
haps, it is an old register of admissions, but false or
imperfect. But to settle the question beyond dispute,
let the bishop and the Superior present it to the pub-
. lie; and let its names be transcribed ; and let inquiry
be made, and see if it eontains the name of every in-
dividual who has been known to enter that convent.
No one can raise an objection to this course.
The other thing to be noticed is the statement, that
Maria Monk in passing from the nunnery thrcugh the
yard into the street, according to the course which she
says she took-" must have passed directly over, under,
or through, at least, three high stone walls." This
may be true, as things now exist in that yard. But it
is known tllat alterations have been made in that yard.
By referring to the ground plan of the drawing in her
book, which was taken in the autumn of 1835, by a
competent gentleman in •Montreal, it will be seen
\hat no vralls then existed in the collrse she describes
herself to have tflkin, until she arrived to the one en
Jean Baptiste street, in which sbe says there was a
small gate,.opening on the inside, through which she
passed into the street. I have been credibly inform-
ed that such a gate formerly existed in that wall.*
But be that as it may, it is matter of little conse-
quence. She may be mistaken in this particular ;
"nd may have passed into Jean Baptiste street,
through the gat.e leading out of the yard of the Con-

dark, and she had just left the ·nunnery, and was,
doubtless, much terrified and bewildered, hardly
knowing what course she did take. She knew that
she had just violated the awful oaths by which she
had been bound to the convent, and that she was
fearfully. exposing herself to be taken and cruelly
punished, if not absolutely murdered, as her saintly
sister St. Francis had been. This bdng the case,
rhe committt'e ought to be 'ashamed of their unfeeling
and contemptuous statement, that "she must have
passed directly over, under, or through at least three
high stone walls that would have discouraged a less
adventurous lady."
Appended to the report of the examining commit-
tee, we han? a statement. from Mr. John Ostell, ar-
chitect and surveyor, giving us the result of a pro-
fessional application of Maria Monk'.
; plan or draw-
ing, to that part of the Hotel Dieu profeslSedly de-
scribed by her-the centre wing. He " declare3 it to
be his opinion, that, architecturally speaking, and
with reference to the practice prevailing in Canada,
in the con~truction of buildings, it is impossible that
the said plan should have any real existence," in con- ·'
ne:tion with that part of the nuimery. Mr. Ostell
assigns three reasoi1' for his opinion. The present
cloistered . apartments, he informs us, " he was not
permitted to enter." ·,·
One of the thre~ reasons mentioned by Mr. Ostell,
has nothing to do \Vith the subject. It is a discre-
pancy between Mafia Monk's drawing of the inte-
rior, and the ground or block plan, of the building,
drawn by another person. Miss M~nk distinctly
&~ate~ in ht>r book, "that the general •plan of the
t I

grouuds and buildings, were in some respects defee·
dve and erroneous," and that she was not responsi-
ble for its errors. It was drawn by a gentleman in
Montreal, who was fully competent to do it correetly,
and who would have done it so, had he not been
driven unceremoniously out of the yard. See Awful
Disclosures, p. 374. Why Mr. Ostell should men-
tion, OS a reason for his opinion, a discrepancy, which
exists between her drawing of the interior, and a
drawing of the exterillr, of the nunnery, by another
person, I am unable to understand.
Another reason assigned, is in the following
words:-" That the partition -walls on the first and
second stories, have no correspondence with each
other, commencing and ending on each separate
story ; whereas it is necessary that such walls should
Dot only correspond with each other, but that they
should commence in the cellar." According to what
is sa~d here, by Mr. O~tell, Canadian houses must be
very singular in thei~ construction-each story, from
the cellar upwards, must· have an equal number of
rooms, of equaJ size. For example, if there be five
rooms on the first floor, there must be five, of pre-
cisely the same dimensions, on the second floor, and
also in the cellar. If there be a bed-room in the
third story, of a three story house, there must be a
bed-room in each story "beneath, even down into the
cellar. If this be so, all I have to say is, that the
mode of constructing houses in Canada, is a very
absurd mode. There is no doubt, however, but what
many of the walls are one and the same, beginning
in the ceJlar, and passing through each story in the
h9~se; but to say that this is· the case with each
~~tion wall,~s evidently incorrect.

The remaining reason is, that-" The second story
plan shows a portion of huilding at one extremity,
without any similar substructure in the lower sto-
ries." This is true, and was spoken of by myself
and the gentleman who assisted Miss Monk in ar-
ranging her drawing for the engraver. It was dis-
tinctly pointed out to her, but she was unable to re-
move the difficulty. All she knew was, that on the
second story, there were such and such rooms, thus
and thus located, containidg such and such furniture,
and devoted to such and such uses. She showed
none of that ready wit and expedient, which her
enemies so liberally attribute to her; nor did she even
attempt to reconcile the discrepancy pointed out to
her. She exhibited the artlessness of a child in the
matter.
It is proper here to say a word or two, respecting ·
the origin of Miss Monk's dra,ving of the interior of
the Hotel Dieu, or that part of it formerly occupied ·
by the cloistered nuns. At the time it was done, she
ba.d been out of the nunnery tome fifte~n or sixteen
months-months nf excitement and varied trials and
sufferings, such as few females of her age are ever
ealled upon, in the 'providence of God, to endure. It "
was made solely from anemory, and in considerablb
haste; for the idea of drawing an entire plan of the
department was not 1Uggested, until the edition, in
which it was to be insert~d, was nearly ready for the
press, although several sketches of different parts had
been previously dra~n. The building described, is ·
a huge establishment; containing many rooms, and
of cour!le, a description of them, solely from recollec-
tion, was attended with .much perplexing difficulty.
This will be readily seen by every reflecting mind, and

if any man doubts it, let him remove his doubts, by nt·
tempting to give a drawing from memory, even of the
house in which he was born nod raised. Under these
circumstances, nothing but an imperfect and general
dtacription, coul~ possibly have been expected. The
demand, that she should have given to each room its
exact proportionate size, so as to have the separating
walls on each story exactly correspond with each
other, is beyond measure unreasonable. No man on
earth could do it, except he were on the spot, with
his measuring rule in his hand. How preposterous,
then, to require it of a girl in her situation !
The two discrepancies between her drawing nnd
t~e building, pointed out by Mr. Ostell, were known
to exist before her plan was published. It wag known
' that the walls between the rooms on each story, did
not correspond with each other; nor was such n cor-
re!Cpondence even sought for, much less professed.
It was also known that'a portion of the second story
extended beyond the first story, so as to be without
any corresponding substructure. Miss Monk knew
it ; and had she been an irnpostor, and of cour11e her
drawing a mere, fancy work, her fancy would have
created a room or two more for the first story, nod
thus have removed the want of the substructure spo-
ken of. This is a strong evidence of her honesty.
Or had we wao assisted her.in arranging it, been so
disposed, we could have.done it; but that would have
been contrary. to our determination from the first,
which was, tbat every thing ascribed to Miss Monk,
in her book, sllould be her own:'production, and not
ours. As we: sought nothing ..but truth, it was our
determiaation; tbac she 'hould atand or. fall by her

And now, understanding the subject, as 1 do, I so-
lemnly aver, that the architectural report of Mr. Os·
tell presents to my mind, i.rresistible evidence of the
fact, thnt 1\{aria Monk has described, \hough imper-
ft.ctly, the centre wing or main building of the Hotel
Dieu,from a per1onal kno1oledgi of it~ obtaintd by
a long re1idence ,:n that e•lablishmmt. Her de·
scription of it appears, from this report, to be quite
u accurate as I ever t~upposed it to be. In speaking
of a portion of the first story, on page 396 of her
book, Miss Monk says:-" Of the size and precise
number of the two or thrP.e.succeeding rooms, I am not
very certain. I think I ·have drawn them pretty nearly.
right." Now, suppose-what is probably the truth in
the case-that, in the indi3tinctness of her reeollec·
tion alluded to in this passage, she has omitted in her
drawing, a single room ; would not the omission ac-
count for the discrepancies spoken of by Mr. Ostell1
Would it not' represent the first story of that long
building, as being shorter than the second, and thus
produce the absence of the substructure spoken of1
And would it not produce the want of a general cor-
respondence in the separating walls, on the two sto-
ries of the building1· -
I beg of the reader to pa1Jse and consider this pro-
fessional report of Mr. Ostell, for a single moment.
Maria Monk, in the first place, gave us a general de-
scription of the first story of the nun.nery-her former
abode; and then of the second story. We comp3red
the two together, to see if they corresponded with
each other; and we saw that they did not. We saw
that she had made the second story somewhat long-
er'than the first, and of courie that there was a want
of a general correspondence in the walls, separating
•

the rooms in each story. We stated the fact to her,
and :she made another t>ffort, but came to the same re-
sult, saying, "I have done a9 well as I could, and if
there are mistakes, I can't help it." We saw that she
was confused in her recollections, respecting a por-
ti~n of the first story-where the rooms are number-
ed, the 4th, 5th and 6th. This imperfection of mem-
ory is alluded to in .the above extract from her book.
But notwithstanding this known imperfection in her
drawing, we published it; and what is the result1
An architect is employed, some time afterwards, by
her opp!)nents, to compare the drawing with the
building; and he reports unfavorably, assigning as
his reasons, the very imperfections which ·we knew
existed before the drawing was published. I ask,
then, what stronger evidence could be presented to
our minds, than is here offered by Mr. Ostell, of the
fact, tLat her drawing is not the work of fancy, but
of sober reality '1 If Mr. Ostell had found any other
discrepancies than these two, between her drawing
and the building,- ·he unquestionably would have
named them, in·place of mentioning the one first no·
ticed above, which has pothing to do with the sub·
ject-the discrepancy between her drawing of the
interior, and the plan of the exterior, of the building,
furnished by another person. He does not intimate
any incorrectness as to the general form and size of
the building, as described in her drawing.

circumstances of the case-her youth and inexperi·
ence in such matters""7the undisciplined state of her
mind-the size of the building, and consequent diffi·

which had elapsed since her elopement from the nun~
nery ; he must see, in the light of Mr. Ostcll~s report~
that the drawing of Mis3 Monk is as accurate as could
have been reasonably expected. He must and will
see the intrinsic absurdity of the idea, thSlt she drew
her plan of the interior of the nunnery from the mere
workings of a wild, undisciplined imaginatiolk The
ml\~ .that can understandingly believe, that her draw-
ing is mere fancy work, can believe any thing, how-
ever absurd. His belief is beyond the point of being
influenced by ·evidence ; and of course it were an air
surdity to attempt to rea~on with him on the subject.
What then is the conolusion 1 Have not the priests ~

their attempt here a~ fruitless, as that in the preceding

in support of Miss Monk's claims.

less does the following declaration of Mr. Curry,
sanctioned by the o'ther members of the committee, ap-
pear!-" In conclusion, I declare, to all whom it may
concern, that if Maria Monk has told the truth in her
description of the inte.rior of the Hotel Dieu nunnery

nuns of Canada yet retain the power of working mira-
cles with stone and mortar."* No miracle need to
have been wrought, nor a particle of stone or mortar
used, and yet it is ex~remely manifest from Mr. Os-
tell's professional report, that her description of the
interior of the nunnery has its foundation in truth.

B.t then there can be no doubt but what extensive

Before leaving this subject, I wish briefly to notil!e-
the senseless fiction, that Maria Monk has described
the interior of the l\Iagdalen Asy:lum of Montreal,
instead of the interior of the Hotel Dieu nunnery. I
l~all this a senseless fiction, recently fabricated for the
purpose of deception. Mrs. McDonell, matron of the
Asylum, states on oath, "that the description given
in the said ' Disclosures,' of the i_
nterior of the Hotel
Dieu, is an incorrect description of the apartments of
the said Asylum." Here is a fair specimen ofjesuitism,
found in the phrase " incorrect description." \Vhat
does Mrs. McDonell mean by it? Does she mean to
say that Maria Monk attempted to describe the Asy-
lum, and has done it incorrectly? or does she mean,
that Maria Monk's attempted de:scription of the Hotel
Dieu, incorrectly resembles the-Asylum 1 I am una-
ble to conceive of any other meaning which may be
attached to it. . To say that Maria l\ionk attempted
to give a description of her Asylum, is a declaration
•
81 ltEPl.Y TO THE PRIESTS, BOOIC.
so absurd as not to be within the limit~ of reason or
comntOn sense. It cam1ot therefore be reasoned about.
And to affirm that Miss Monk's descriptions bear an
incorrect resemblance to her Asylum, is about as rele·
vant as it would be to affirm, that they bore an incor·
rect resemblance to the moon ; for both the moon :ind
Mrs. McDonell's Asylum have· the dimensions· oi
length, breadth, height, and depth, and so has Maria
Monk's drawing; and in this respect there is an
in.correct resemblance betwee·n all of them.
, The truth js, this "exemplary and charitable"
woman is unworthy of the least confidence. She has
J>erjured herself in several instances in her affidavit.
She affirms that Maria Monk had led the life of a
stroller and a prostitute, for -many years, in direct
opposition to all the priests' witnesses, who affirm
that she·had been living during this time in Sorel and
St. Denis-in the latter as a school mistress, for
so~e fifteen month~, while Dr. Nelson says she was
a part of the time with her mother. ·She also affirms
that Louis. M:alo was in the habit of visiting :Maria
Monk during the winter of-1834-5, whilst he affirms
that he never heard of her during this period. She is
amere tool of the priests, ready to swear to ~ny thing
which they com'~and her. Respecting this triek of
the priests, I have more to say hereafter.
I will conclude this chapter with the subjoined ex·
pressive resolutions, simply observing that the com·
mittee therein named to explore the convent, in
company with Maria Monk, have as yet received no
permi~sion from the proper authorities, to discharge
the duty assigned them. Why is this 'I If Maria

"Rt&ol~td, 3d, That the recent examination, . d
to have.. been ·made, of the Hotel Dieu nunnery of
Montreal, is.·aJtogether unsatisfactory ; because ( 1)
the gt-ntlemen engaged in it have been, from the be-
ginning, strongly ancl acUvely prejtedic'-d against
Maria Monk. ·Mr. Jones, editor of a Romish paper,
under the au~pices of the priest~, and principal mover
in getting up the book against Maria ~1onk, which is
about to appear, containing, among other thing~, the
results of this party examination, was ·their leader.
And because (2) mataial alteratio11s are Baid to
ha-re been made in and around tltf! convwt drering
the past_
year-alterations, such as doubtless would
t.'asily deceive such a committee of examiP.er:S. For
these reasons, any report unfavor:1ble to Maria Monk;
made· by these disqualified ·ex3rnincrs, ought to have
no influence in deciding this controversy.
': Resol-r:ed, 4th, That the recent effort of the priest3
and theiF defenders, to make it appear that Marin
Monk, instead of describing the Hotd Dicu nunnery
and its inmates, has described n place which tiH~Y
ealJ. a "'Magdalen Asylum;" and also, their attempts
to,provc,·hy the affidavits of some unprincipled prof-
ligates and infidels, calling themselves protestants,..
and of ignorant papists, that she never was a nun;
hut that she has been of a bad charaeter, Jiving in
brothels, &c., is highly charac_
teristic of Jesuitism;
adapted to blind and bewilder the. public mind, and
turn it away from the single point to which it ought
to be directed, viz: an impartia.l e.1:arni11ation oflite
Cont~ent.
"lli!solt·ed, 5th, That the demand made and reitera-

viz: that h(>rself in person: accompanied by her

right ; and that a further refusal: in the present state

of the Hotel Dieu Ecclesiastics, ought to be conJid-

"Re60l.,ed, 6th, That a committee offour gentlemen

tbt')' know full well. Henct> the various o.nd contra-
dictory sources, which they have alleged to be th~
true origin of her disclosure~C.-Lct us notice some
two or three of these. .
Immediately after the "Awful Disclosures" were
published, the Boston Pilot (a Catholic paper) issued
· the following statemt>nt, as disclosing their t•·uc ori·
gin:....: .
"We are ready and willing to declare upon oath,
that the extracts which we have seen in the New
York Transcript, Boston Morning Post, Salem Ga-
zette, and other respectable periodicals, purporting to
be extracts from the disclosures of Maria Monk, &c.,
are to be found, word for word, and letter for letter,
(proper names only being altered,) in a book transla·
ted from the Spanish or Portuguese language, in 1781,
called ·' The Gates of Hell· Opened, or a Develop·
ment of the Secrets of Nunneries,' and that :we, at
present, are the owner of a copy of said book, which
w~s loaned by us, a year or .two since, to so~ person
in Marblehead or Salem, who has not returned it."
This statement was extensively circulated both
through·the Catholic and Protestant.papers; and .mul-
titudes were led to believe that ·it was true. But tin1e
has shown it to be otherwise. Min Monk~s publish-
ers forthwith otfere~ one hundred dollars, to any in-
dividual who would present them with a work thus
resembling the "Awful Disclo:sures." But the priest,
who fabricated and published the !ltatement, and
who "1Da• ready and 1Dilling to B1Dear" to hi• O'Um
lie, has never be~n able to produce such a book.

published them in her name. The writers- of the
' Awful E xposure" assume th_
is position, as a truth
which needs no proof. Hence the title-page of their
book:-" Awful Exposure of the atrocious plot formed
by certain individuals against the Clergy and Nuns
of Lower Canada, through t~e intervention of Maria
Monk." W ho these individuals are, we are not in-
formed. But they are unmercifully dtmounced as,
"a band of fanatics1" "an association of impostors,"
11 abetters of Monk," "advisers ofMonk," "her crew,"
11
infamous," "canting hypocrites," "calumniators"
"using Monk to convey their own slanders,'"' rendered
insane by the instigations of their own m, lice," pos-
sessing. " unparalleled impudence and imbecility,"
"atrocious intentions," ".minds prolific of calumny,"
"strange audacity," being unable "to construct n lie
of ordinary verisimilitude"-which by the way, is
equivalent to saying that they are not practised in
tht art oflying.
On page 81 of their hook, the priests speak as if the
"Awful Disclosures" were the production of some
one man ;- whom they handle after their accustomed
manner. Say they:-" When this refutation and
these proofs shall meet the scurrilous and unhesita-
ting defamer, will he not seek to escape .the light of
day and the ~egards of his fellow men 1 The turbu-
lent current of his deliberate and blasphemous fanati-
cism will be heated by hot shame and.unavailing re-
gret. The stupid and lying wretch, th~ base knave,
the imbecile criminal, will writhe · in his anguish,
scorned and ·loathed by an insulted and ·indignant
community." Who the individual is, thus mauled, I
bow.not. .But I .think he .must have been a name;.

.lirit of March, 1835. Now it is stated in the " Awful
Exposure," that·slie was releastd from jail on the
19th ·or NoYember,- and taken b)· her mother to the
Government House, of which she is the keeper. ·And
it appears that she was at her mother's residence, for
several ·weeks before goi~g to the Asylum. She
could not, therefore, have been there for three
months.
But how came she in the Asylum 1 Her unfeeling
mother sent her there. But ·why should Mrs. Monk
place her in that establishment 'l ~t will be recol-
lected that Maria Monk had attempted to drown her·
self, and as -a consequence, being considered an in-
sane vagrant, she had been imprisoned. " Awful
Disclosurefl," 266-7. This attempt at self-destruc-
tion eonnected with her confinement, for a few days,
in jai~ were considered by Mrs. Monk as disgracing
her family ; hence she wished to cover up the matter
as·much~ as possible, by keeping her daughter eon-
cealed from the eye of her friende. lVhile Maria
remained with her mother, she was not allowed to
see any 'company-this, however, was iri acc~nce
with her own wishes, as .she lvas in constant fear or
being-apprehended by the priests-so that even· he~
own brother did·not know thaishe was in the houe•,:·
until about .two weeks after she -entered it. But Mrs.
Monk heeoming \Veary.of keeping Maria afte~ ·this·
manner, procured a place for her in the Asylum, prob-
ably as-a boarder. This conduct of Mrs. Monk, is
in·perfect keeping with her general treatment' of her
thildnn-or at lea$t of some of them-which is any
thiar rather. tban maternal. In ·consequence of her

ten years of age. . The ·same bruti.Hty which thus
drove her eldest son from under her roof, ·also drove
her eldest daughter, Maria, to seek a refuge in the
nunnery. Much might .be said on thi11 subject, but
I forbear. ··
Maria Monk states that, during her re~idence in the
Asylum, she kept.her chamber from the day she enter-
ed, until about the time she left it. She was in fee-
ble health, though not as much so·as-she feigned her-
self to he, in order that she .might be allowed to keep
her roum. · Her motive was, the fear of being·detect-
ed by the priesis, one of whom-Father/ Bonin~ one
of the murderers of St. Franci:5-was· the con~\->ssor
·or the establishment~ She· state~ that she·had as lit-
tle intercourse as possible with any in the house-not
even seeing Mrs: McDonell ·above three or four times,
until the day. she left the-house. Hence the fact that
Mrs. McDonell and a Miss ;Howard,.both of whom
have ·given· their affidavits respecting her, are igno-
rant of ·her person.. A gentleman from New York,
being :On a· visit, not long since, in ·Montreal,.hear-
ing &,bM-Jane Ray, eoncerning.whom Miss M. has so
much .'to say.·in her writings, was hi the asylum, call-
ed-to:,ee her. He.waK teld that she.was not..in, but
.,-.ld'~ in shortly. He remained in waiting for an
hou.ri~ a half, but no Jane .Ray·.made ht-.i appear·
••-'· . During ,his stay he had some conversation
with .Mrs. McDonell, and Miss Howard, about Maria
Monk, a~d they told him, and his companion, that
she. had light hair! Now, be .it.known.,to these wo-
men, that·Maria Monk's hair is 'di.rectly the opposite
of .light. It is·black. I would.add that 'the gentle·

The following· statement ruspec&ing the origin of
Maria Monk's disclosures, and her.Jirst acquaintance
with Mr. Hoyt, has the sancdon of the R~v. Mr.
Toppin, Chaplain, for several years past, of the Hu-
mane and Criminal ln~titutions of the city of New
York-a gentleman of unblemished character.
" In tbe summer of 1835, M!l~ia Monk, authorets
of the.' Awful Diacl.osures,' was Heriously ill, and, as
&he supp,
osed, on the borders of the grave. In tbia
situation, she sent for me, and with all the solemnity
of a dying hour, she communicated to me the priori- .
pal .statements respecting the Hotel Dieu nunnery
of Montreal, which abe bas since published to the
world, in her disclosures. She did this by "'ay of
peniten!ial conf~ss.ion. Her object app,
enred to be,
not to criminate others, but to confe;Ss her own ~uilt,
and thull relieve her troubled conscience ; for she felt
that she had, in some . ~ensc, been a par~icipntor in the
horrid crirnell which she divulged. At the time,
it was very evident to my mind, that she had no i~.ea
that her disclosures to me, would ever be made known
to the public. The impression, which I then receiY-
ed of her honest @incerlty, remains to this day unef- ~
f~ced. This was s"
orne time befor~ ber.acquaintance ·
with Mr. Hoyt; _
who, havipg recently arrind in New .
York from .Qannda, and having beard of her case,
called on me to make inquiries respecting it, and was,
by ·me~ introduced to her acquaigtance."
Here then we learn, when it'~ that M.~· Hoyt
first beca~e acquainted with Miss Monk. Mr. Ta~
pin states that a shor~ time after Miss Mon'k'.: co~~

Hoyt, then. rece•dy from Montreal, called upon this
friend of Mr. Tappin's, who communicated to him the
cireuinltances of the ease. Hence the manner in
which Mr. Hoyt ftrat .heord of Miss Monk. And .hav-
ing rrsided, as an agent for Sabbath schools;for some
time in MontreA.l, it was very natural that he should
feel on interest in the disclosures which Miss Monk
had made. He accordingly sought an inter'fiew with
her, and after consultation with her, and witb a·few
gentlemen in Ne\V York nod Brooklyn, it was deem·
ed advisable that Miss Monk should go, as soon as
her heahh would admit'of it, to Montreal and present
her criminal charges .against the prie.sts and nuns to
the civil' authorities of that city for investigation.
. She accordingly \vent, irfcompany with Mr. Hoyt, to
Montreal. · · ·
Mr. Tappin's statement is of a very impres!ive
character.· Sufficiently so, it,appears to me, to more
than outweigh all.the opposing testimony;.whieh the
opponents of ·Mi!S Monk have f!Ver been able to pro·
duee against the truth of her claim"! There is soml'·
thing in the dying penite~tial confessions of' an indi·
"fiduol, that precludes the pO$Sibilhy of intentional
misrepnosentation; Such· were the ·confessions of
Miss Monk, as she 'supposed~·· She was then a Roman
Catholic, and as such, she lfUpposed ·rhat the salvation
of her soul depended, in a great measure, upon her
eonfe:;sing to some minister of Christ before she died.
But then she sup~sed that her confessions waul~ re·
main, ·locked rip in the breast of her confessor, as shu
~· ahv~ys been'taught by die Roman p·riests. · , .

Cory or a letter from the editor of Miss Monk'•
book, addrened to the Rev. J.'J. Slocum, under date
of New York, Oct. 29th, 1836.
"You have requested from me a statement of the
origin of the book called 'Awful Disclosures,' &e.,
of the circumstance's connected widi its preparation,
and the motives of its publication.
"The first time I ever heard ofMiss Maria Monk,was
in the month of October, 1835, when Mr. Hoyt called
on me, in company with a·friend of.mine, (and, as I
onerwards und~ntood, at the suggestion of another
£riend, a merchant of New York,) and proposed to
me to write' her narrative·for publication. This I at
first declint!d~· saying that my time was too murh en-
grossed ; but being informed of iome of the leading
particulars of her history and disclpsurel, (which are
now publicly known,) ·ilnd assured that her story waa .-
worthy of investigation; I consented to devote a pOr-
tion of time to the subject' for one wtaek-that bein1
considered sufficient to perform at least ·an important
part of the task. . . . ..·

note down briefly her statements; a~d. this I contmued
to practise, ·~vith care, and all the accuracy I could,
during the many interviews which I afterwards~ had.
I endeavored from the first to subject her testimony
to.tbe most rigid tests; and.esper.ially to try the con-
sistency of her statements ; being satisfied ·that if the
tale were not true, I should ~e able, first or last: to
detect inconsistency. I often entertained suspicions
of its truth ; and in or~Jer that I might detect and ex-
pose the i~posture, I sought for evidence from ditrer-
·ent quarters. .
'' The narrator did not receiv_e my confidence, indeed
she did not claim it, independently of .other testi-
mony. ~he repre;ented herself as accustomed to
systematic deception ; though then disposed to com-
municate the truth, and only the truth, on subjects of
moment connected with her experience and observa-

disclosures, were evidently such as could not have
b.,.;n produced either by accidental conjecture, nor by
studied invent!on. Oa the contrary, tbey were of
-such a nature, and brought out in such connexion;,
as to show, beyond any reasonable doubt, that Miss
Monk drew, from recollection, real scenes and char-
Mters, with 'Yhich she had been acquainted, in a so-
ciety fundamentally _
different from any.known among
QUrselves, or ever fully developed in any publications
'I had seen or could discover.
"Bu~ there were other kinds of evidence to which
I had ac-cess. Although I never had entered the
Veiled Department of the Hotel Dieu, I had formerly
visited·Montreal, and had more local acquaintance
with that city, than Miss Monk was at first aware of.
I had also means of testing some of her statements,.
by resorting to the testimony of individuals, disposed
to render some assistanee.
'~Beside this, several scenes, of much importance in
her narrative, had transpired in this neighborhood ;
and some of the most important PQints connected
with them, were confirmed by persons worthy of all
credit. We thus became satisfied, from an .early
date, that she had been found in a Friendless~ expost!d,:
and suffering condition,·and introduced into the Belle-

ed in conversation, and in her habits of thought, feel-

of the truth of her story. Sbe appeared to .know
such things as 11 nun (according to her descri.ption of
a nun) would be likely: to know; and to be ·ignorant
of what·such a person would be ignorant of. Her
reflections, motives, fears, hopes, expectations, asso-
ciations of ideas, superstitions and errors, were 11!1
appropriate to the cbaracte1· to which she laid elaim,
u her Canadian dialect, to the city in which sht
professed to have spent her life. The same.may be
said of her hasty, and sometimes tumultuous feel-
~ngs, when excited by apprehension or. opposition;
the changeableness of her view!~, al)d the succes
sivc~ elevation and depression of her spirits. Her
mo'tives and reasons for speaking and acting, were
also often such as would be appropriate only to a re-
cluse, shut out from the knowledge and sympathies
- of the world, accustomed to .be controlled by super-
stition, and liable to be subdued by ·force, when that

"She suffered a considerable part of the time, from
superstitions, and other fears, which were sometimes
.almost too s,trong to be suppressed; while a ~ense of
her friendless condition would at other times almost

ever been her indifference to property. She has been
accused, by writers who spoke on conjecture, of hav-
ing fabricated her book for the sake ·of gain. A per-
!OD acquainted with her, would have been likely to
assign any other reason before this. - In the ·first
place, Mhe never proposed to publish it hei'st>lf, and
was- often half inclined to give over the undertaking;
and, in the second place, she has sho,vn such. 'a dis-
regard fo~ money, that her friends have often found it
difficult to prevent ~er ·rrom giving away what she
possessed,, to any persort who wanted it.
"It was found difficult to obtain all the testimony
from Canada, whicit was to be desired. 'rhere were
gentlemen of high respectability, in New York, _
who
from the first scouted the ide~ of Miss Monk's hav.:.
ing been a nun; arid this was particularly true of
some of the Presbyterian clergymen; while it hap-
pened that, for some time, only· one of their number
ever was known ·to express a word in ·her favor. I
have no doubt, that had it'not been for the exertions
of one or two laymen, Miss Monk':! story would have
been rejected and suppressed, within the first few
weeks after her return from Montreal, and never have
been brought before the world. ·
" The opposition among the Presbyterian_
clergymen
alluded · to, was found to be chiefly owing to letters
written by the RE:v. Mr. Perkins; pastor o(- the Ame-
' .
rican Presbyterian church, of Montreal, to warn
them against the impostures of Miss Monk, who, he

before our eyes, which ever n~ordcd a strong corrobo-

tency. All ~ross-qoo~tioning failed to confound or
confuse her; .and the familiarity with which she ex-
:plained :tpJlarent inconsistencies at one moment, and
at !lnotber presented new .scenes and characters, or

eTidently impossible,) that the .story was the inven--
tion of some unknown penon, who contrived to teach
it to Miss Monk, and extended it at secret in&e"iews,
while she was ~ngaged in communicating it for publi·

be allowed to possess peculiar talents, and must be

Whnt are his designs f would become natural and
reasonable questions: It therefore always appeared to
me, that in every point of view the story of Miss Monk
was worthy of investigation.
" Several of the charges which have been made
against Miss Monk, have with reason been regarded
as affording evid~nce in favor ofits truth.
"In the first place the book h11s not been copied or
formetl, even in the small~st part, on any other.· The
editor ofthe Bost.on (Roman Catholic) Pilot, solemnly
asserted,· that a large part of it at least was copied
from an old Portuguese book he had posses:Sed ; but
while this was known to be utterly void of _
truth, the
charge gave us a strong confirmation of its accuracy.
What better evidence could be expected from the op-
position party, to prove that .both the book~ were
faithful pictures of nunneries on both sides .of the
Atlantic 1
"In reply to several other charges it may be stated,
that it is -known and cnn be proved, that the book was
not writtfln for'the purpose of making money. The
primary object was the publi~_ation of important truth; .•
and its secondary, to procure the means of supporting
an unfortunate and friendless young female, and her
innocent babe. None of those who have assisted her
in preparing her book, or in def~ndi ng it, ha':e recei\'ed
a fair equivalent for their· time and labor; -·and, I
think I may safely assert, that all have rept!atedly
deelared they neither expected nor desired. it. Their
great object is the discovery of truth; and they will
hold themselves reatly, if ever the fact shali be proved, ·
to confess that they have be~n deceived; and to m~ke
all possible amends. The day when such ~vidence

The following certificate; sign~d ns it· is by gentle-
men of the highest reputation, is o sufficient Toucher
for the unimpeachable character of the gentleman
who has furnished &he·above statement of Jacts.
"This certifies, that the under!igned are personally
acqt1~inted with the gentleman who drew up t·he nar-

Thus it is evident, beyond ,;lll reasonahlc doubtt
that Miss Monk is 'the sole autbore~s of the fc'lcts,
contained in the disclos~res attributt'd to her. And
it is proper ro pause here a mo~Mnt, and remind the
reader of the eondilion into ·which the advo<!ates of
the nunnery have brought themselves, by end~avoring
to maintain· their several positions, as to the origin of
her boolt, after it is thus rendered evident that they
cannot retain either one of them. The ground is
false, and their plea pr~posterous. They have there·
fore now new ground to choose; b:.~t their ease is
rendered very suspicion:; by being thus driveti back
again to their ohl_
position, and left.exposetl, withour
a shadow of defence.

MARr·A MoNIC affirms that she ·has been a nun in
the Hotel Dieu nunnery of Montreal, and tbat her
statements respecting that establishment are such as
•• knows, from ·her·own experience and observation,
to' be true. On the other hand, the priests and their
advocates deny that she h3S ever been an inmate of
that convent; and, of course, maintain that her dis-
closures are so many fictions. The hinge, therefore,
on which the whole controversy tums, is the fact,

whether or not she ha~ ever been n cloistered nun.
And, although this q•Jestion is distinct from the ques-
tion of the truth of her statements, in point of fact,
Jl't, in the di$CU"ssion, they naturaJly run into eacb
other. The prieus, on the one bond, attempt to draw
an argument from the cbaracter of her disclosures, in
support of their. poljition, that she has never been a
nun; while on the other hand, the friends of Miss
Monk reason from the same source, to prove thnt slu!
must have ~een an inmate of the nunnery. The for-
mer maintain that thP. crimes, which she olll'gcs are
Ju1bitually practised by themselves and the nuns, are
incompatible with human nature; while the la.tter
argue that they are just wlHlt might be expt-ct.ed from
the circumstances of the case-that they are in perfect
accordance with the history of <'onvents: and that a
girl in her situation could never have b('come a~
familiar with them as she is, unless she had been as-
sociated with a society addicted to their practice.
Hence the question, both as to the fact. of her having
been a nun, and as to the truth of her disclosures,
are intimately blended in this discu!sion.
n" ~~ •
Ini'this controversy, a!i (rom truth, the priests ··
have greatly the advanti . ..They are a numerous
and powerful body of men; skilled in the arts of con-
troversy. Miss Monk is an inexperienced gii-1, yet in
her youth, having no friends, 'except such as she has
gained by her apparent honesty and consiseepcy,
since the controversy commenced. Moreov.er,Jrom
a varietv of circumstances~ the mass of t-he people in
Canada· are prejudiced in favor of the priests amt
against her, so that they are disposed to afford them
any assistance io their power. This is the caso to a
gr~at extent, ~even with the ProtestanJs, especially in
·•
ue CONFIAMATIOH Of
Montreal. Not only the ordinary relations which
bind society together exi:st between Catholics and
ProteHt:mts in Canadn, but there are relations or •
flpteial character existing in the present ca&e. · The
government, it is true, is nominally Protestant, but
then such h the st"atc of parties there, that it require111
in ordN to its very cxi:dencc, the patronage, to some
extent, of the prit.•stg. 'rbis the wily priest!~ give to
it: in order that they, in their turn, tnay receive the
aptcial smile!' of civil officers. Mnria Monk stat~s
another circumstance, r~specting some fen~ of the
more wnlthy and n·ominal Protestants in and about
Montreal, which is, that they·are licentious visitt!rs or
the nnn·nerr. If thii be true, h exhibits a reason for
the violence ortheir oppo3ition to her.
Another thing worthy of spec,ial notic!e ~s the fact,
that the field of ne1rly all MisJ Monk's t!Xternal testi·
mony i3 in the power of the prit-sts. 'rhey have her ·
former tB~ociates and companions: nay, thf'y have
her qwn blood-connexion~, so completely under thf'ir
control and intiuC'nce, :u to restrain them from· utter·
ing .any thing favorablt! •,to her claims. They also
han···thc nunnery in th · .)J03se~sion, and will' not
allow it to be impartial!•. xamined. .Hence the tte-
mahd for more external, evidence, made by many, is
unreasonabiP. Every su[ject has evidence appropri·
atP. to itself; and that-and that alone ougl:lt to be all
that'should be required.
~ e· public pres~ in Canada is either Catholic or
political. Henc~ it ha~ from the first been violent in
its opposition to · Miss Monk. It took •its stand
against her before she had published a single word.

readt>rs. · ·
The character and conduct of Mi3s Monk furnish
• I:.·
•
118 CO~FIR!\1..\TI.ON or
the strongest evidence in support of the g~neral
truth of her claims, as a profc9scd ex-nun.
1. Her incapacity to have acted the part of an
impostor, is, in tlte lligltest degree, evident to all
1Dho cz.re personally ar.qttaiuted with her.-The co-
gency of thi~. argument is .acknowledged by her oppo-
nents. Honce they deny that she i3 the authoress of
the disclosures attributed to her: They maintain
that she is a mere tool, in the hands of others, who
have fabricated and published them in .her name.
But this, I trust, has been shown to the satisfaction
of the reader, to he U'Ctrue. It has been shown, that
she, and she afon~;"· is the autbor\!SS of the dark tale,
which she has published to the astonishment of the
people of this country.
Miss Monk is young, and possesses a mind alto-
gether undisciplined by study. Her education is in-
ferior to that of ordinary country girls. Habits of
study she has none. Her knowledge of books is, or
was when she first arrived in New York, next to no-
thing. And, if the " Awful Exposure" gives us a
true history of her life, she has never been either a
n•m, or a Roman Catholic ; but "has led the life of
a stroller and a prostitute.'' If this be true, it is ask-
ed, how a girl of her age, character, and attainments,
cou)d possibly fabricate such books as her "Disclo-
sures 7" The supposition beggars all belief, but that
of blindness. If. she has fabricated them, Rome,
with its numbel'less. saints, may be· fearlessly chal-
lenged to produce a miracle any thing like as great.
Besides, on the supposition, that she had fabricated
her "bisclo5ures," it is impossible tha.t she should
have been able to act the part of an impostor, up to

minus have been at work, for more than a year past,
endP.avoring to develop her true character. Botb
friends and foes have been thus employed. Had she
been an impostor, it would have been discovered,
long before this day. She constitutionally possesses
transparency of character, to an uncommon degree.
Hence the predominant wor~ing~ of her mind are
very apparent, to a penetrating observer. She has very
little of that systematic concealment and forethought,
so necessary to a succ~ssful impostor. Her openn~ss
.of character, constitutionally considered, is almost the
first thing observed, by an intelligent stranger who
may chance to .see and converse ~.ith her. Hence, if
such a person has been skeptically' disposed in regard
to the general truth of her claims, his skepticism, in
perhaps nineteen cases out of twenty, has been re-
moved by a free conversation with her. Such an in-
dividual readily perceives, that her mental constitu-
tion· is such, as totally to disqualify her to act the
part of protracted imposture.
The argument, therefore, under this head, is two-
fold--bein~ founded, 1st, On her incapacity to create
b,er "Disclosures"-2d, On the supposition that she .~
posses$ed such ability, her i~capacity to have suc-
cessfully concE'aled her impo1:1ture, up to the_present
. '
t1me.
2. Her minute and e:vtensi·ve nunnery kno1olcdKe,
connected with the et;tse and dexterity with whick
she can perform the many ceremonies of a. con.-vent,
can be accounted fqr, on no other supposition, than that
of her having been a nun, as she states. Her prac-
tical knowledgE' of Popery a~d Jesuitism, of prie.ts
and nuns, of the furniture and diversified apartmeqta .
of the Hotel Dieu, of the ceremonies ·arid practice•
tao CONFmMATlON OF
of that establishment, is such as could ·have been ac-
quired by her, only by a residence of years in that
conv~nt. She is as fh~ilint with the mummery of
Popish observances, as a school-boy is with his al-
phabet-such as penances, hymns, Latin prayers, &c.
.&c.,.though· she is as ignorant of the meaning of
Latin words, as she is of tht' Chinesc language. The
, Eame is true with ref~rence to U.1e ease with which
she performs the various bodily ceremonies, some of
\vhich ~he speaks of in her book, such n~ falling upon
the knees, and standing erect upon them, &e. &c.
With ihe Romish catechisms, she is perfectly· famil-
iar. In a word, she is, in regard to these matters, all
that "ive might suppose her tn be, on the suppusition
that she has, for years, been a resident in the convent.

ller circumstances have been peculiarly trying, ari·

thrown upon her statements, and the consequent
violent dcnunciati<?ns \vhich have been ht>~ped npon
her ·Ly Protestants, especially editors of newspapers,
wlio have taken ··very little pains to im·estigate ·the
subject. Often has she felr., as if she had·scarc~ly a
re3l friend on earth-
-as if all the world was·against
her, making her the helpless victim of i~s- combined
contempt and indignation. Yet amidst all her·trinls,

MARtA MONK's Dl8Cl.OSORES. 125
While at Montre~l, it was denieJ hy the priests
that she had ('Ver bt-en an inmate of ·the Hotel Dieu.
·She nt onc«.> offered .a fair t ' .t. of th~ fnct, which, by a
Tery· little trouble, would hove settled the point beyond
the power of contradiction. Sh ..proposed a descrip·
tion of the interior of the convent..:_its (uriliture, ,its
inmates and different apartments, ·and \heir uses-
and staked her all upon its correctness. But the
application of it was nol allowed by her opponents;
on what ground, no mortal can conjecture, unless it
'vere that they wt>re afrnid to abide the results.
On the fourteenth d~J)' of last Ju.ly, I receive1l a let-
from tbe llev. Mr. Perkins of. Montreal, informing
ine, that on the following day a committee of gentle-
IDl!n were to apply the test, which she had proposed
nearly one 'year before. The thought immediately.
occurred to me, if she be an impostor I can now dis-
cover it, by communicating to her this unexpected
intelligence. I applied the test, in the best manner
to ac.complish the end in view, that I was capable of;
nnd the result was such, as decidedly. deeyened my
convictions of her honesty. Other particulars might
be mentioned, were _it .necessary, all going to sho,v"'
the consistency of her conduct, with the supposition,
that she fi!els herself standing upon the ror.k of truth.
On the other hand, if she be an impo:;tor, her con-
duct ha·s·been; in the highest d~gree, preposterous and
unaccountable. , Suppose that she had described the
interior of the Magdalen Asylum of Montreal, inst_
cad
of the Hotel Dicu.nunnt>ry. She certainly must have
been s~nsible of tht\~fact. And if so, is it suppo:oahle
that she would have gone to Montreal, for the purpose

The supposition is.~bsurd, beyond the power of lan-
gu'age to express.· If she be nn impostor, the extremes
of u'n'parnlJeled genius, a:n·d the mo~t stupid folly anf1
ignorance, meet in her. Considering her. youth :n:Jd
limited opportunities, she· has exhibited a talent .for
invention, in her. worb, comp:lrcd with which th~
po~veri of,Sir w ·alter Scott are .but as a drop to the
ocean; while on the other hand, she has evinced
stupidity~ if po·ssible more remarlmble, iri staking her
·all upon the general truth·of her description of the
interior of a huge building, of which she is as igno-
rant as she is of the palace of the king of ·china.
And.then, to crown her folly, she ·has urged, with an
importunity that· would accept of ·no denial, tho ap-
plicati!>n o,r this test, . 'vhich she must have known

MARIA MO~tt's DISCLOSURES, ·JJ'f
it bo!e the internal marks of truth, notwithstanding
tome of it!4 statements divulgt'd the perpetration of
crimes, by priests and nuns, :Dd('r the cloak of.relj-
gion, of so horrid a character as to make an hon~st
man shudder at the thought of, the~.. I will mention
some two or three things which havc.·b~en urged ns in4
ternal marks against the truth of the ''disclosures;"
but which, it appears to me, atl:ord evid:mce in its favo.r.
Th~ Circumstances connected with the murder 'of St.
Frances, is one of the.>e. It is said "that its com-
parative publicity, and the number of individuals em-
ployed in it, are marks of its falsehoo'd." Thu~ argues
the Rev. Mr. Perkins of Montreal. Now, in the first
place, th£'re wn~ no publicity about it, except such as
bl:!longed to the convent. It was done within the
walls of the nunnery, shut out from all _
COIJ?munica-
tion with the world. In the ·second place, the f~~t,
when understandingly considered, that so many were
employed in it; is a circumstance corroborative of ttie
truth of the narrative. Tw~- reasons muy be assi~n~d
forthis :-1. It is the policy,of such .es~ablisbments
thus to do, for thP doubl£~ purpose of inspiring .terror
nt the thought of. disobedience, and ai the same time, -, >
implicating -
all present i~ the crime committed. It
had this effect on Maria Monk. . Hen.ce her peniten-
tial confession, ~t the·time she thought t~at she \vas
going to die, te·the Rev. Mr: Tappin. The.seco~d
reasonj3 this, that it was a regular court, or inquiii-

a gentleman as w.ell versed in, the history of popi~h

· truth. Now Maria ·Monk knows nothing of these
' reasons; all she knows is the simple fact, that such
and -such persons w '.· present, and that they did &!1
she states in hP.r narrative. Had shP. forged the story,
undoubtedly sh ~vould have made · it a more private
affair, and w_
ould have c·re!lt£d reason'J for every .thing
connected with it. But as it is, it beau the stamp of
simple truth. -
· Marin J.\llunlc; on pnge f95 of her worlc, sa"ys thnt
she once saw a book in the supt-rior's room, contain-
-ing, among ot~er things, a record of births which
oce•n in the convent. Now it is asked, '.'if infants
are , j'mmcdiatc~y · baptized and· strangled after their
birth; what can be th~ object of !!Ouch a record? Why
expose themsch·es,·by making a record·of their own
crime 1''' 'Now, as in the case above, Miss Monk is
'incapahle of assigning any reason why such a record
t~hould be kept. All slie knows, or pretends· to know,
is the simple fact that such a record then existed.
l]'ndoubtedly, if she were an irnt:ostor, she nerer
\Vould have created thc'statement, without·ereatiug n
re9:so~,' for : it-at the snm·e time. Thl! same may bl'

amani:um~is, in so examining her as to render it im-
po!lsible for hE'r to have acted the part of an impo!'tor.
Miss · Monk's mincl is undisciplined: and is wholly
unaccustomed to connected thought and orderly ar-
rangement. Hence her ·statements have all the sim-
plicity and want of connexion of -those cf ·a. child.
'!'his circnmstnnce would hnve enabled bcr writer to
have caused her to contradict herself in her narrations,
had she not been based on the truth.
Miss Monk's narrative is consistent with itself and
with reason. It is minute and specific in its detail!!,
re!'pecting places, .persons, nnd facts. In a word, it
bas every internal appearance of truth. How con all
this be accounted for, ifshe be an impostor 1
9. '/'he moral r.ltaracter of Jltlisa ft·lonk'a mind,
for many months after her.nrrival in New York, was
such all to furnish a high degree of evidence in sup-
port of her pretensions. She tolcl us how and where
she had lived .for several years past. The moral con-
dition of her ·mind ~ore its unequivocal testimony to
the truth of her narrative~ She informed ·US of the
svstematic deceptions .which were inculcated and
p~actised in the ·society with which she hnd be~n ·•
connected. The painful truth of this statement,
waJ eastly discovered in the· state of her mind. It
was seen that for her to speak !ruth, when n slight
temptation to deviate from it, presented itself, .requir-
ed an effort on h-er part.' 'rruth being the basis of
confidence, the latter, ns mattN of course, cannot CX•
ht in 'the absence of the · former. It was, therefore,
evident that the ·inmates . of the Hotei Dietl, could
place little or no confidence in ·each other; and that _
jealousy and suspicion would naturally exist, to a
fearful extent, in such a community. Thus it \vas

with. Moa·ia 1\Ionk; ultbough constitutionally eh~

1ite qualities. · She was suspiciou~
of t>verybod)·, and couhJ'confide in nobody. 'l1
o rc·
pose full confidt•ucc in tho~e around hc·r, was a lesson,
which it took her some time to learn. In n word, nc.
cording to her statements, the character of the com.
munity with which she had been liva.~; . w~ts prcu.
. liar, such as cannot be found in civilizeu lile; but
only in a cloistered convent. It WR3 in n high de-
gree s<.'lfish: subject to the violent exercise of tlw
darker passions of depraved human nature; such ns
constant (f)ar, . jcalou~y, want of confiucncc, suspi·
cions, subjection to absolute authority, not out of re·
spect, but from fear, irritability, .growing out of a
forced submission to a code of .contemptible ·ccremc·
nies; in fine, .the nbscn.cc of whatsoever ·is pure,
Jovely, and of good report, in the female character.
She bore the.impress of.tbis wretched community on
her soul, thus evincing the danrnctcr of the eJucation
~he had received ; although, as I had occasion to re·
mark before, the moral textmc of her mind, constitu·
tionally considered, is clirectly the oppositt>. She is
naturally liberal, even to cxces~, open, frank, nfiec·
tionnte, ancl r.onfiding; and these traits of character
lm\·e been, for some time past, rapidly developing
themselves.
There ran he oo stamp without: a corre!ponding
seal. But Miss Monk's character furnisbe!' us with
a stamp or impress~ altogether peculiar; and · the
question is,·where is the seal or counterpart 1 If it
does not no'v exist, it certainly must have existed at
the · time the impreuion was made. I repeat tht!
question, where is it 1 Miss Monk declares that it

\t, •Le& the priest!!, then, tell the world.where it cali

Moalr:
. Such is a ~mnmary view of the urguments, in
confirmation of ~ iss Monk'$ claim to public confi·
dence, n• deducted from her c·haracter, person, con-
duct, and narrative. They are susceptible of much
r.xpnnsion, as my object has heen, rather to suggest
thought, than to expand ir. The evidence thus de·
rived, is of n character peculiarly strong and con·
vincing. It is of on internal character, such as an
enlightened mind loves to confide in. It is the upou-
tuueou& testimony of nature. And can nature bear
false witness 1 lmpo3sible! It is true, nature mny,
to some extent, be counterfeited; or we :nay mistake
her voice, and attribute testimony to her, which she
does not gh·e, nud thus deceive ourselves and others.
But it is impo~sible that sh~:: ~!: odd utter any thing,
but what is strictly true. _ Now, it h possible that
myself and others, have millinterpreted the language
of nature in the present instance; though I declare,
that I cannot realize it. Hcnct>, if there were no
otht'r eviden~e in confirmation of Miss Monk's testi-
mony to be found, I should feel that I stood on firm
ground, in endea\·oring to support the truth of her
claims as an ex-nun. For I ft!el, that the statements
and affidavits of interested men, in opposition to the
evidence adduced in this chapter, are of no value.
In the scales of motnl evidence, they are lighter than
abreath. They ore like chaff to the wheat; fit only
to be given to the four winds of heaven. Unbelieving
Protestants may hence learn what has been the prin-
eipal ground, on which the friends of Mi~s Monk, in
New York, have.stood, amidst the c.'iamorous denun;,

IT is often asked, why the fri.ends of Miss Monk,
provided she bas resifted for ye!lrs in the Hotel Dieu1
do not produce the testimony of a sufficient number
of living witnesses, to establh;b the fact, beyond the
power of contradiction. If a person has lived for
years in a given place, it is asked, is it not an easy
matter to prove it, by amultitude of witnesses 1 I
answer that it is, in ordinary cases. But the case of
·Miss Monk is peculiar; perhaps without a _
parallel
on the pages of history. Her reshlence hns been in a
cloistered nunnery, shut out from the world. Since'"
she escaped fron1 the con\'ent, she bas macle kno,vn
the-vile practices ot' her former associates, the }lrie~ts
and nuns; and ·they, in self·dt:fence, deny that she
was ever·oue of their nutnb('r. MoreoYer, ~y 'their
man_agement they have sealed the lips CJf her fri~nds,
out-o( the -nunnery, in Canadn, who might ~t~aerwise
.te~tify as to the place.of her former abocle. Had· tbe
~t~er been otherwise n-iaoaged at first, ··doubtless

years ago, at her mother's residence and at other pla-
tes, but that they saw nothing of her during the time
in whick she alleges herself to have been in the nun-
nery. They all say, that cluring this period of time,
they"have missed her; but as to t~e fact, whether or
no she was in the convent, during this time-, they
know nothing about it.
The following is a specimen of the kind ofevide~ce
alluded to. · A. few ·days since, I.saw a lady from
.M(?ntreal, who observed, tha.t, a .short time ago, . she
was_conversing with a Mrs. **** o.f Montreal, a re-
specta.ble and Christian lady, who stated,.that she had
known Maria Monk from her childhood ; and that the
last ti~e she' ever saw her, was about the time she
says, that she. returned from St•.Denis and entered
the nunnery-that she (M. M.) then called. on her
(Mrs.****) to obtain money from her, for her mothet-.;
and that she let her have some, though Je.ss than
what she asked for. Now it will be recollected that .

did obtain money fr9m several individuals, o~ her.

inq~uies of those who ought to know &omething of
Miss Monk's past history, he writes as follows:..:.
"Now .tht> fact is just here, everybody is afraid to
know any thing about this matter: and all her rela-
t.ives seem backward to say what they might ~n the
~ubjE'ct. Romanism is so far predominant here, that
there are only a very few who have correct principle
and moral courage enough to th;ink, speak, or act, aright
in.the concern. Political, pecuniary, and relative in-
terests and connexions, have occasioned such a com-
~ingling of Romanism and Protestantism, that it i!i
difficult to reach the black heart of the Roman beast,
nominal Protets~nts are so much in the way. A
~ookseller said to me yesterday, that he and all the
oih~r ·booksellers in the town were afraid to keep'
Maria Monk's book in their stores, lest a mob should
attack them."
Tile subjoined testimony of Mr. Miller and Mrs~
Hahn has been some' time before the public. -That
of Mrs. Hahn is the more important. It is that of an
old companion, and of cour&e there can be no mistake
as to her acquaintance witb Miss Monk. Mrs. Hahn
describ~d the person of Miss Monk, and stated the~
substance of,her testimony before she saw her; and .
before Miss Monk knew any thing of Mrs. Hahn's
re:-iding in Ne·w York. pollusion, therefore, between
the partie:s is out of the question. Mr. Jones, ;while
in New York, inquired .of me what I should ' sayre-.
spe~ting Mrs. Hahn's testimony, if she herself ·~er.e,_,
to acknowledge .that it was false. I replied.~bat- it.

cbietly upon them. 1\frs. Hahn, however, remains
unchanged as to the truth of her statements.
·- Mr. William Miller, a resident of New York for
several year~ past, and formerly an old s'choohnate
of Maria's in Montreal, testifies that, on a visit to th~
latter city: in the summer of 1833, he called on Mrs.
Monk, the mother of Maria, and inquired for Maria
and was informed by her that her daughter Maria
was then in the nunnery. See his affidavit, Awful
Disclosures, page 237.-The prie!'ts, in their. work,
dispose of this affidavit by exhorting Mr. Miller to
repent!
, Mrs. Hahn,.now a residen·t of New York and for-
merly a schoolmate of Miss Monk; testifies that she
was with Maria -in the school of the Congregational
nunnery for about two year3: that she was pre.;ent
at the time that Maria was received as .a· novic~ in
the'Hotel Dieu; and that she saw lier some time after
this, while she \vas ·yet a novice: and· that she saw
her a veiled nun, towards the dose of the winter of
i833-4-, in the ho~pital of the Hotel Dieu, which she
at that ~ime frequent!y visited, in order to see a sick
friend: and that "a short time afterwards," she saw
her again in the same place among the veiled nuns.
See her testimony: Awful Di-

to preclude almost the pos-

MARIA MONK's DISCLOSURES. 137
formed. on evidence more or less conclusive, which
ought to have its weight in determining this·.contro·
versy. There·is the opinion of a large number of in·
dividuals; who have taken some conside.::able pain~
to inform themselves on the .subject, not only by read· •
iog what has appeared iu print on both sides of the
question, but aho by such an examination of Miss
Monk, as has been satisfactory to thP-mselves.
Among this class arc to be found men of the first
standing in the different learned professions. I know
that this is me.re opinion, and as such I give it for
what it is worth.-There is another class of person~, .
whose opinion ought to have still more weight, be-
cause their opp,ortunities f9r forming it have been
much greater. Among these are the different fami·
lies in which.Mi;,s Monk has resided, sin<:e she ca~e
to reside in New York. The eelehrated vVhitefield,'l
think it was, was once asked his opinion respecting a
cert~in individual, with whom he had some acquaint·
ance. His .reply was, that he did not know him, hav-
ing nevt!r been with him in hi~ .family, the on!y place
in. 1oldch a man's true character could b~ d1:sco·vercd.
Thus it is in regard to Maria Monk; her true eharac·
ter is easily diacoverell by those with whom·she ·daily '~
associates. And these, I think I may say without a
single exception, are ,horoughly convinced that she is
not ·an impostor. 'rhe affidavits of all Capada could
ha~dly shake their belief.
To these I would add the unwavering opinion or
the gentleman who penned her works for her. He i11
a gentleman of high standing in the community, for
literature, integrity, anJ .piety. No man could have
f~lt a deP.per solicitude on the subject,. than he has
felt• ..He h~s..f'elt, ~hat not only his own reputation
12•
139 CONnRIIATION .OJ'
was at stake, but that truth-to him priceless-was
to acbit>ve new vi,~torie3, or receive detrim~nt, ac•
cording as 1\liss Monlt'~ testimony should prove true
or false. Hence he bas spnred no pains to,get at the
• simple truth of the case. whatever that might·be.
I trust that the-reader will not consider it out of
place, for the writer of these pages to add hi~ own
opinion to the nbove. It i~ now some Pight N · nine
months, since Miss Monk came to reside among the
people of my pastoral charge. During thil time I
have eeen her in a Ynriety of circumstances; have
heard hcr ·convcr~e with friends and t>nemie&, Prote~t-
"' ants and Catholics, and men of all professions ; have
improv~d every opportunity, which God in his provi;.
denc~ ha~ given me, to ferret out the truth in rdation
to her claim~-and as the result of the whole, I delib-
erately ~ay, that I have never SCPO any thing which
Jed -me, for any lt>ngth of time, to doubt the general
truth of her story; but on the contrary, the t.>vidence
of its truth ha'; been constantly augmenting, so that I
could now almost a:; ea;ily b£'1ie"e any-supposabl~
impos!!iibility, a~ to believe that she has· been ' acting
the part of an impostor; in what she bas done.
The other class of individuals "whose opinion is ·or
some importance on the subject, are those who know
a part of Mi~s Monk's stat~menr3 to be true, and who
infer from that, the truth of the remainder. A-mong
these are to be founcl, those females scatt~red through
the eouritty, who' ·rccc.>ived tht>ir education in· the
Congregational Nunnery of Montreal... A short time
since, I heard ·one .of this claes speaking on. the sub·
jeet, aftt>r the following manner:-" Miss Monk's de-

Congregational Nunnery of Montreal, arc generally .
so eorrect, that I cannot but think, that her descrip·
tions of thing!! and practices in the Hotel Dicu, the
cloistered part of which I was never pennitted to
visit; are also generally correct." I have heard gen-
tlemen who have long reaided in Montreal, and who
were familiar with matte" and things without the
concealed part of· the conve_
nt, reason in a simil~r
manner.
It iJ known t~ many, thnt there is a subterrnnean
passage, leading from the priest'3 Seminary to the
llott>l Dieu. In addition to what is !'aid on pages 24 J
and 332 of Awful Disclosures, respecting this passage, ·
the following, taken from the St. Alban~ li'rnnklin ·
Journal, is ~ubjoined ~ Even Mr. Jo~es, the publi~ber;
of the "Awful Exposure," admitted, to several ge~ ·
tlemcn in New York, that there wa~ such a passage ;
but that it was not more thnn th-
irty feet long! The
existence of thi3 passage is known to many in 1\·font- ·
real. \\'hat is the object of such a pas~age1 Can'
any thing virtuous require that a houc;e of priests
fhou!d he th.us ·united, by a concealed: under-ground
passage, to an establishment of secluded women 1 ,
And I would further ask, liow a man, who believes ·
in th·e existence of such a·secrt>t ·communication, car~
disbelieve the "Awful DisClosures" of Maria Monk 1

jlepravity, that can believe they would. The foll~w­
ing is the communication alluded to.;
cc As there is some .excitement in the community
upon the subject of Popi~h licentio~sness and .vice
from the disclosures of 1\faria :Monk, and as some af-
fect to disbelieve and ridicule her work as totally
false, being in possession of so~e strong evide.nce
- that will confirm her st~tements, I giv~ the public
the facts.
"In conversation with a gentl~man, who was some
months since a Roman Catholic in Montreal, hut bas
renounced their .blasphemo~s .dogmas, and is now a
profe'Ssed Christian, he told me,.that he had been em ·
ployed to labor in the cellars of the Priests' Seminary
at.Montreal, and whilt> there engaged, he discovered
a door in the wall of the cellar, which on opening, he
found it connected with a passage under.ground. He
entered· the passage .and _passed through it until he
came to some stairs,·at the head o( which was a trap
door. From the direction and distance of the passage,
he was perfectly certain that it must he a subterrane-
ous comm.unication between the Seminary and the
convent. He further informed me, that from the tes-
timony of many females, his relatives not excepted,
that at confession, tl.te pri~sts w.ere in the habit of
asking !he most licentious and revolting quest~ons
that could be propounded,_not only to m~rried ladies,_
but also to girls of thirteen years. . . .
"Likewise from the,habiliment~ of the ·~uns, and
their appearance at times, he \Vas wholly confirmed
in the belief that their course .in the nunnery was any
thing but virtuous. At the time of his making these
disclosures, I think Maria bad not written her book.

truly painful to come before the public with so ofl'en·

be spreading through the community by Catholicism,

thus t~J appear. "E. SPRAGUE.
" St. AlbaM, July, 1836."
The ensuing statement is from a gentleman who
was fur many ·years a resid~nt in Montreal. For
reaSOils satisfactory to himself; his name is withheld.
His testimony is undoubtedly true.
"I often heard of a subterranean passage, from the
Seminary to the Hotel Dieu nunnery, years ago; and
while the eataedral wa~ building, I often saw that
part of it \vhich was opened in digging for the founda-
tion. It was near the east corner of the cathedral;
where the waterworks were laid along St. Joseph's
street. Several years before, I saw the same passage
ope~d in another place by the · workmen, who had
removed several ~tones and exposed it to view. I
have often h~ard it spoken of, as a thing very generally
known; and never heard any doubt of its existence,
until the appearance of Mr. Jones' book, and Mr. ·"
Stone's pamphlet., ·
The following documents on the subject of the
subterranean passage, are extracted from the Ameri-
can Protestant ·Vindicator, of November 2, 1836.
They have appeared since the above was written :-
"The first witness is the Rev. Oli·Der JJ"etmore, of
Utica. In a late eonversation with that beloved min-
i!lter or the gospel, he thus remarked-
" Mr. Stone says: ' No subterranean passage be-

ern patts of the State of New York, thirty-three
year• ago, I was ·fu•quently at .the house of Judgtt
Moers, who re~ided about a mil~ from the Canada
line. That gentleman repeatedly talked with me re-
specting the Roman priest~ and Popery, in Montreal,
which he bad often visited. He spoke of l.he ,-ubter-
ranean passage between .the Seminary ar1d the
Nunnerlea, as a mauer of most public notoriety ; and
detailed the dissolute ·lives ,of_the p.-iests, their habit-
ual gambling, intemperance, and ·profligaC)', as well
as the Hcentio\ls&esi of tho .female co.nvent!i of Mon-
treal; which Judge Moers said, were as open matters
of talk at. that pt!-riod, in that city, just as mueh as
the .most common affairs of. life. Judge Moers also
represented to me the priests.and nuns of Montreal.

It appears, from this~statement, lhat the- existence-
of an underground passage, betw~en the. Priests'
Seminary and the nunnery, has been a matter of con-
versation for many years. .

was a resident of the city of Montreal, Lower ·Can-
ada-that at that period, the existence of a subterra·
nean passage between the Seminary in Notre-Dame
street, and ~.he Hotel ~ieu convent, was a matter of
the most public notoriety; and that he himself has
been in that passage, having entered it from the door
in the Seminary.;_and t~e said Hogan doth further
depose, that to his own· personal knowledge, the Ro-

"AcTJGN~ speak.louder than .words," is a maxim
as renerable'for age, as it.is jtJst and true. Accord-
ing to . this maxim, it i~ evident, that the1~onduct ,of
Miss Monk's oppon_
e,nts furnishes an argument of ..•
great force against themselves, and, of course, in·
Huppert of her claims. The position, which they·
have taken, that she !~...~n i!Dpostor,_

all ·doubt, :with one-thousandth part of the labor,

·But let_us look at their conduct a little in the de- ·
tail. When Miss Monk visited ·Monveal in the
m_op~h of August, l835, aad there1p~esented her
13
J.16 CONFIRMATION 0~
criminal charges against the priests and nuns, it wa~
denied ·that she had ever been a nun in the Hotel
Dieu·nunnery. In proof that she had been an in-
mate of that convent, Miss Monk offered to furnish
n. description of. its i,nterior-its apartments, its ,per-
sons, and their o~cupations, '~c.-and u~g,~d the ex-
amination Qf the ,nunnery, w~th a view to the appli-
cation of the proposed test. Certainly this W<~s fair
on her part. Why, then, did not the priests comply
with the proposal '1 If she had been an impostor,
what easier and more ready mode of proving it, to the
satisfaction ofall concerned; could they have desired?
The reply often made, that she and her friends were
·unworthy of their notice, and that the co.nvent was a
sacred place, not to he inspected by men from tlie
world, is not less insulting than it is o!lt,ue ; for thcr
did notice. her, by collecting and publishing affidavits
against her;.and men from the world, such as thev
have been pleased to 8elect, have been.admitted int~

the nunnery to inspect it. Does not their conduct in'
this particular betray guilt 1
A short time after Miss Monk returned to New
York from Montreal, her ~pponEmts made an attempt to
prove an alibi-to show that she was elsewhere than
in the convent, durhig the time in which she declares
herself to have heen in that estnMishment. They col-
lected and published six or eight affidavits, the im-
port and character of which is known to the public.
Five of them refer exclusively to matters subsequent
to her arrival in Montreal. The other two are those
of D~. Robertson and her mother, Mrs. Monk. Dr.
Robertson states, that on inquiry, he had ascertained
that she was at l$ervice in Sorel and St. Denis,·a por-

told certain per~ons, that her daughter had not been
in the nunnery. This is the amount of their testi-
mony ; and, if Marin Monk had been an impostor,
can any man believe that the priests and their advo-
cates, wo!lld have rested their cause on a foundation,
so unsubstantial as this 1 Does not the weakness of
their defenee, show the unsoundness of their cause~
The next step worthy of notice i'n the conduct'of
the priests, is the visit of father PHelan of Montreal
to New York, in order to decoy Miss Monk away
from her friends in that citv. This was in the win-
. '
ter of 1835-6. A detailed account of it may be seen
in the first chapter of the present work by Miss Monk.
As this priest came to New-York in disguise, leaving
an·impression in Montreal that he had gone to spend
a fe~v weeks on Nuns' Island, it is presumed, that his
visit to this city· will be denied. It can, however, be
proved that he was m New York at the time specifi- ...
ed, and that the impression was made in Montreal
that he had gone to the Island. It has been publish...
ed again and again, without being as yet contradict~ ··
ed, from any responsible source. Why then should .•
that priest visit New York under such circumstances,
unless it were in some way to destroy Mi~s 1\lonk's
testimony 1 He knew her feelings towards himself
as the father of her child ; and he knew that a spe-
cial intimacy had been formed and cherished between
himself and her, during her residence in the nunnery ;
in a word, he knew that if any man could draw her ,
away from her friends in New York, or induce her to
withhold her testimony, he was the man. Out of
regard to' him, Miss ·Monk was perfectly silent re:..
apecting his visit to New York, until after the abduc~

tion plot, during the follo,ving summer, had been de.
velop~d. It was, however, noticed by her friends,
that her•feelings towards him, during this lapse of
time, were diflerent from what they Wt!re, prior to
this visit. Now if Miss Monk were an impostor, is
It supposable that this priest WOUld have .thus visited
. er 1 And does not this visit stamp with the seal of
truth her claim~ as an ex-nun '1 What stronger evi·
dence can be demanded 1
In the present work by Miss Monk, will be found
an account of the attempt in May, 1836, to abduct her
away from New York. The principal facts in the case
are mentioned by her, in her narrative of the attempt.
From personal knowledge, I know many of her state·
ments respecting this matter, to be true ; and others
of them I believe on good authority, to be equally
founded in truth. To mention particulars, such as
I know too be true, would occupy too much space.
They may be seen in her narrative. My object at
present, is with the fact, that such an attempt was
made ; and of this there can be no reasonable doubt
·in the ·minds of such as are acquainted with the facts
jn the case.
It is certain.that several .individuals were thus en·
gaged ; and it is certain that some of them were Ca-
nadians. They were prowling about the neighbor·
hood for a number of days. They were seen ag:!iu
and again, and her uncle, on the Sabbath specified by
Miss Monk, was overheard in conversation with her
respecting the matter.
The design of the plot wa~ to induce Miss Monk,
yoluntarily, to leave New York. The }llot was well
formed, and well conducted;'and would have suc-
ceeded, had it not been thwarted by the untiring vigi-

lance of Miss Monk's friends. ·Miss monk was com-
pletely deceived by her uncle, until ~he time specified
by her in her narrative of the affair, when a gentle-
man called on her, and made .known to her tne true
nature and design of the plot. I was present at the
time when the gentleman called, and I regret that it is
not permitted me to mention, at present, particulars as
to the betrayal of one of the ~nemy, by which the lu.-
timate object of the scheme was communicated·to her.
·Now they knew whether or not Miss Monk was an
im'postor: on this point, they could not possibly be
mistaken. Would they then, be at so much trouble
and expense, to decoy away a known impostor1
·The supposition is ·preposterous in the extreme. It
is therefore evident, that she is not an impostor.
The next attempt on the part of the priests to vin-
rl::-~.te themselves, worthy of special consideration, is
t·"' ;: ft,und in their book, entitled, " Awful Expo-
sui ... ,; The contents of this book have been examined
in the first part of this work; and it i~ believed, that
the r.andid reader is prepared to unite in pronounc.i,ng
the attempt to be an entire failure. Their object bas · ..
been to destroy Miss Monk's testimony. To do this,_
they have undertaken:-
1. In the first place, utterly to destroy her charac-
ter. They have attempted to prove that, besides be-
ing insane, she is a compound of all that is infamous
in the vilest of women. But in this, they have come
·short. Their attempt only" evinces the weakness of
their cause, and the infamy oftheir witnesses. Their
witnesses, as we have seen, are false witnesses, tes-
tifying in several instances, in direct opposition to
each other. '· ·
2. They have repeat~d their attempt to proTe an

~he nunnery, she was living in Sorel, St. Denis; &c.
Here they have (ailed; and on what ground t.an their

their position '1 Is it possible rationally to conceive of

·, 3. Being themselves conscious of the incredibility
~f their testimony to prove an alibi, they l111ve en-
deavored to !lUpport it, by an exparte examination
of the nunnery. But this examination has only help-
ed to expose the .unsoundness of their cause. "\Ve
have seen, that the report oi their ,professed architect
furnishes a high degree of evidence of the fact, that
Miss Monk has, as correctly as could have been ex-
pected, described the apartments of that portion of
the nunnery which. she attempted to desc1ibe. The
priests have, therefore, utterly failed in this effort to
mislead and deceive the public. What, t.hen, is the
consequenc of their failure 'I Does it not prove.them

;, 4. But, as if sensible of the rottenness of their foun-
",·1 I.Ation, .they have, .as a last desperate resort, taken
refuge in Mrs. ·McDonell's Magdalen Asylum.

.the.evidence which they had collected, to.prove Miss
.Monk to be an impostor1 They do not even pretend
that she wa!!1
ever there, prior to the time she profess-

MARIA MONK's DISCLOSURES. 151
Resp~cting this movement ofthe priests, it is proper
to make a few remarks, in order that its character
may the better be und~rstood. The idea that Miss
Monk and her friends manufactured the " Awful Dis-
closures," from what she learned in the Asylum, is of
recent date. It was never heard of in New York, so
far as I can learn, u_
ntil last summer, nearly a year
after she preferred her charges in Montreal, against
the priests After this long period, they wish us to
believe that the conventual ceremonies, interior
apartments, and persons-themselves excepted, I sup-
pose, though they do not say so-described by Maria
1\lonk, are such as she saw in Mrs. McDonell's Asy- .
lum. Miss Monk, in her book, speaking of her novi-
tiate state in the Hotel Dieu, mentions the names of
four novices, as also that of Jane Ray. Tbe priests,
in order to carry forward their novel device, have fur-
nished us with five affidavit~, from as many persons,
bearing the names mentioned by Miss Monk as in-
mates of the Hotel Dieu. These women are made
to testify that they were inmates of the Asylum at
tb£' time Miss Monk was, and that she became ac-
quainted with them there. But who ·has ever ·se;;n
these in.dividuals hi the Asylum 1 A gentleman
from New York called.there twice, but he could find
but one out of the five named, and·she evidently had
never seen Maria Monk, for she described her as
having light hair, when in fact her hair is black.
No\v, that this whole affair is a mere jeauitic,al de-
vice, deaigned to mi!!llead the public, is not only mani-
fest from its intrinsic absurdity, but also fl·om the fact,
that immediately after it was publicly announced, the
Asylum was said to be broken up and its inmates dis-
persed, because 1\0 more means could be obtained for

their support. How happens it that the stream::s or
benevolence in Montreal should become dry ju!olt at
that time 1 And how happens it, that if Maria Monk
has described the interior of Mrs. McDonell's estnb-
lishment, it was not made known at an earlier date?
Why especially ·was it clos~•l from inspection, as
soon as the discovery was made '1' It does appeal'
that, if any thing can demonstrate the desperateness
of the priests' cause, it ill this silly Magdalen trick
of theirs. I call it silly, for it does seem to evince a
degree of stupidity on the part of the priests, which
cannot be ac~:ounted for, unless it be on the principle,
that those whom the Almighty abandons to de5truc-
tion tor their viee~, he often, in his providence, drives
to otherwise unaccountable follr and madness.
Thus we have noticed the more prominent at·
tempts-; which the priests have made to defend them-
selves from the charges preferred again3t them bv
Maria Monk. Several ·minor attempts have bee~
passed over; such as their celebrated ha~dbill, which
was so extensively circulated in New York and other
places, declaring that Miss Monk was a Protestant
girl, and had been living for four years with Mr. Hoyt;
and al!!O their declaration, that her " book was a trans·
lation from an old Portuguese work;" arid since then,
that it was not her production, but that of"" certain in-
dividuals who had formed an atrocious plot against
the CIE.•rgy and Nuns of Lower Canada."
What a mass of untruth and palpable contradic-
tions.! Is the supposition possible, that the priests
are innocent in this matter, when all their attempts
at se.lf-defence have only served to sink them deeper
and deeper, in the bottomless abyss of falsehood and
infamy1 One thing is certain, and that is if they are
innocent, their conduct is beyond measure unaccount·
able.

able. It belies them in a manner that it is truly as·
tounding. With a voice that cannot be misunder·
stood, it proclaims them guilty.
In conclusion, I would seriously press the inquiry,
whether it is supposable, that, if the priests were in-
nocent they would have borne such a load of reproach
and infamy for so long a time, without having demon-
strated their innocency to the world. Especially when
it could have. been done with so much ease, by pro-
ving Miss Monk to be an impostor, if she is an im-
postor as they maintain that she is. The belief of it
beggars credulity itself. The reply," they stand upon
their character," and that the " disclosures of Miss
Monk are unworthy of their notice," is as preposterous
as it is untrue. Stand upon their character! Common
sense ~ebukcs so gross an absurdity. The horrid
charges, preferred against them by Maria Monk, and
believed by thousands and tens of thousands to be
sober truth, "unworthy of their notice!" "\Vho can
believe this 1 If it be so, it may be asked what is there
on earth, that can arrest their dignified attention1
Finally, it is manifest that the priests have utterly
failed, in every attempt they have made in their ow~
defence. · What, then, is the legitimate inference, from
this fact 1 Is it not, that they ~re guilty 1 That they
themselves nrc impostors, instead of Maria Monk's
being an impostor1 In reason's name, it is asked, how
can it be otherwise 1 How can it be that they are in-
nocent, and that she is an impostor, when every thing
that speaks on the subject, proclaims the opp~site to
be truto. This is the voice-not only of her person,
character, conduct, narrative, of religion and nature,
and of the testimony of others--but it is also the
Yoice of every attempt which they have made in self-
vindication. '

Extract from lhe New York Observer-Inquiry as to the object ur

· are false garbs-Their object priestly lndulge~ace-" Awful Disclo·

THE following is taken from an able article in the
Ne\~ York Observer.
" Popery forbids Its priests and ecclesiastics to
marry, and encourages the devotion of each sex to a
single life. Hence convents are provided both for
monks ·and nuns, to which they may respectively
retire from the world, and lead a life of holy seclu-
sion, as it is termed, from the temptations of the
flesh'. Nature cries out against this unnatural and
forced separation of the sexes. Reason condemns
it as monstrous and absurd, and religion pronounces
upon the unnatural and absurd prohibition its sever-
.est denunciations, "forbidding to marry," being ex-
pressly classed with the "doctrine of devils." We
cannot escape from the conclusion that a course
which nature, reason, and religion unite to condemn~
must be productive of evils of a kind and extent
commensurate with the folly, absurdity, and impiety
of the parent evil. We here see one of the·strongest
passions of human nature, a passion implanted in
man for the wisest purposes by the God of nature,
unnaturally restrained by pains and penalties. What

bas not required the sacrifice, where he h:1e, in fact,
prohibited it 1 Need I pursue the details of th~ . ~e-; . .
generating procc~:~s, to show the easy steps by which ,
I passion thus restrained, descends to crime '1 How .
the nun, at the confessional, must pour into the car
of a man, the secret conflicts of her own breast, with
regard to this very passion ; how the priest ques-
tions; and how he may advise his fair penitent in se-
cret 1 Need I depict the voluntarily incurred temp-
tations·to·which both are exposed by this most un-
natural intercourse 1 It can scarcely be otherwise,
than that crime should be the result. Both priests
and nuns nrc kept from its commission by no luema11.
restraint, and certainly by no promise of divine as··
~istance, but nrc left weak and unaided to contend
with, and to be vanquished by, this strongest of hu-
man passions. Love thus perverted is lust, and ev-
ery one knows that· the secret servant of lust, is
~lurder."
In reason's name, I would ask, what is the object
of female cloistered convents 1 '\.Yhy congregat.e ,
an assembly of youthful females, and.then bind them,
not only with bolts and bars, but with the most sol-
emn and superstitious vows and o~ths, nel·cr more
to have any eommunication with the world? Why
deprive such of that liberty which the God of naturt}
has given to all mankind 1 To imprison an individ-
ual for life, and thus deprive him of _
his liberty, is
considered to be next to the highest punishment that
can be inflicted for crime. But of what crime have
the helples~ victims of female convents been guilty,
prior to their becoming nuns? Can it be said that
the religion of the Son of God demands such im-
prisonment 7 Ifso, where is the chapter and Y.e:cse 1

I have never been able to find.it. But I do find that
'-'111···... was " to proclaim liberty to the capti'De•, and
t . .. eningoftheprison to them that are bound." Tho
,Voice·of Christianity, therefore, is that the doors of
these female prison houses be opened, and that the
captives be set at liberty. Christianity is from hea-
ven. It came into the world, not to derange and
break up the institutions-of man's social nature, but
to haJiow and purify them. Did the God of nature
make woman for society, or to shut her up in a nun-
nery 1 Let the advocates of nunneries read the sec-
ond chapter of the first book in their Bibles, if, they
have any ; and they will learn that woman was made
for man, not to be shut up in prison. Revelation,
therefore, is against nunneries.
·Reason still presses the inquiry, why should inof-
fensive and unsuspecting young ladi"es be decoyed
from the path of life, which Christianity prescribes,
and be intombed for life within the walls of a con-
vent 1 l"oung laclies, I say, for the priests will hal'e
no others, unless it should be some who were very
rich, and received for the sake of their wealth. This
fact proves to a demonstration, that the object can-
not be of a religious character; for if it were, then
the aged and the infirm, who are now excluded,
would, of all others, be received. I am aware of the
fact, that a religious profession is the bait, by which
youi1g females are enticed, by the priests and their
panders, into nunneries. They are made to-believe
that the moment they enter a convent, they are
thenceforth removed from all worldly temptation,
and are, during the remainder of their lives, to be
devoted exclusively to the holy duties of religion.
But that this is untrue, is evident, not only from the

Defore closing this chapter, perhaps something
should be said, respecting tho order of " sisters of
charity," as they are called. These females have,
no doubt, done much to mitigate the sufferings of
the sick and destitute; a~ al~o to impart papnl .in-
struction to poor children. This is natural to the
kind and sympathizing nature of the female ,sex.
But does this argue any thing in favor of this order
ofwomen, who are require<J to live in a state.of ce-
libacy 1 Are these amiable female qualities confi~ed
to this mode of life 1 Must woman live a single-life
in order to be kind and generous to the needy and
the helpless 1 . 1 • • • •

.-In' popish history, as also those .who have so-
journed·· somewhat extensively in popish countries,
find no difficulty in .believing the " Awful •Disclo-
.sures" to·be substantially true. Hence; too, the fact,
-that·gentlemen'of extensive observa~ion, who have
· .been reared··in Catholic countries, amidst the vices
of Roman ·priests, not unfrequently ridicule. the in-
credulity of·the American people, in ·re~erence to
this matter.··· .. ' . ··.· . ., ' ,. ;
Roman .Catholics glory in the infallibility DNheir
church; and, 'of course; its immutability. It is,
.say'they, the one church ·of. Christ; the same in
every ·age (and in every country.· The author of
these pages is aware·of the fact, that when the·con-
sequences of this principle are pressed upon the ad-
vocates:of. popery, they attempt..to evade them by
some Jesuitical prank or other. · Still; it·is true~ if the
tree·is one and the same in ·all·ages and in all climes,
its fruit must be substantially the same, under all
circumstances. Thus,- in regard to·the'spirit of po-
·pery, it is one and the same the -world over, and in
every age; and'- bears substantially the saine fruit,
-
wherever. it is allowed··to·arrive to .full-maturity.
Now, what is.this spirit, as exhibited on the impar- .•

Perhaps no subject:more perfectly-illustrates the
murderous spirit of Roman priestta, :in past...ages,
than the," Holy Inquisition," as papists call .it. This
"infernal. tribunal" originated: with.the priests-it
was introduced into every country into.whieh ·they
had the power of introducing it-and· by.thetn it
was sustained; as·long a8 they·had the power of sus-
taining·it. For cruelty, it stanqs without a rivlil on
earth, and, I hope, also in the dark domains·.of Sa-
tan below. Thank God.,that humanity and the Pro-
testant religion ,have nearly banished it fro~ the
e.
ai'th, although i~s dreadful spirit still ~emains with
those·who originated ..and. sustained1
it. . The object
of the inquisition .is the destruc.tion cif·'~ damnable

unto death, all such as dare to think and.bclieve con-
trary to the wishes of the chureh; that is, the priest-

meaning of .tlte··word church; among Roman Catho-
l!cs. . In Spain alone, its victims, according to .the
e1timate of Llorente, from 1481 rto 1808, amounted

Jlies, had a difficult part to act on this occasion, as
their discoveries could not'be made of any particu-
lar time and place. ~n one side,,a religious fear of
incurring the threatened censures, goaded .their con-
sciences so much .as .to compel them to .make the
required accusations ; on the other side, a regard to
their.husbands, to whom they justly feared .to give
offence, byaffording them any motives for suspecting
their private conduct, induced them to keep at home.
To obviate these difficulties, they had recourse to th<:
measure of covering .their faces with·a veil, accord·
ing to the fashion of Spain, and thus went to the in-
quisitors·in the most secret manner they ~ould adopt.
Very few, however, escaped the vigilance of their
husbands, who, on being informed of the discoveries
and .accusa.tions made by their 'Yives, were filled
with suspicions; and yet, noh~·ithstanding this ac-
cumulation of proofs against the confessors; produ-

following declaration, on page 50 of their book.
" Now tite priests of Montreal and of Canada, do
( enjoy, at least, public esteem for morality, and if
necessary, the tt:fstimony of every adult in the
province would be gladly yielded to their excellent
eharacter." 'fhe father of lies coul<l not fabricate
u. purer untruth than this."'
I have taken some pains to inquire of gentlemen
from Canada, respecting the moral char(\cter ofthe
pri_
ests, out of the nunneries, and the result of my
inquiries is, that it would be doing them no injus-
tice to apply to them the above picture given of
their brethren, the priests-of Spain. I could men-
tion names and particulars, if it were deemed advi-
sable. I will mention the name of one "adult,', ip
whose good opinion the friends of the nunnery
appear to place much confidence. The gentleman
alluded to, is the Rev. G. W. Perkins of Montreal.
111 a letter, dated March 18, 1836, fipeaking of the
convent, he says:-" Now that fornication is com-
niitted, there is no reasonable question i" that is, in

According to the above picture, what is the eon-
fessiona11 Beyond ull question, one of its grand
objects is .to secure female victims for the impure
indulgence ofthe priests. Its history affords pain-
. ful evidence of the truth of this declaration; and
were it properly understood, no virtuous /amily
would ever 'allow its female members to visit it, any
sooner than they would allow them to visit a
brothel.
'For the truth or the following statement of facts,
I hold myself responsible. A Catholic young wom-
an, ardently devoted to her religion, by the name of
Miss N-, liv'ed in the family of Mr. M-, in New
York. In lier appearance she was quite prepos-
.sessing, and probably of virtuous chara.cter, up to
the time to which this narrative refers. A short
time before good-Friday, which was the first day
of last April, she was observed to be uncommonly
devoted to the ceremonies of her church. About
this time, she said to a young lady of the family,
" My father Confessor is a going to bestow upon me
a wonderful gift, about next good-Friday, if I am
faithful to go frequently to confession, and conf ss
all my sins, and answer all the questions which he
asks me." " "

lady. "Oh, no, not a carnal gift, but a spiritual one ;

Miss N. increased her visits to the confessional,
going more frequently as the time ofher exaltation
drew ncar. At length the time arrived. Miss N.
was lo go to confess at that ti.me in the evening.
She went, but did not return until"early the next
morning. Sad disappointment nnd shame were de'-
pic~ed on her countenance. To the question, asking
her where she had passed the night, she 'declined
giving a direct answer; On one occasion she said,
that she staid in the church all night; but then it
should be known that the house of her father Con-
fessor was in the immediate neighborhood of the
church. Miss N. remained in the family of Mr. M.
but a few days nfter this.
I leave my readers to make their own inferences.
But I would nsk, if it be not the duty of the friends
of virtue 'and good order, to discountenance a prac-
tice so corrupting a~d so ruinous to all that is virtu-
ous in the female character, as is that of confession
to a corrupt priest. Destroy the confessional, and
you at once destroy that fatal power, which th.e
priests now have over their deluded followers ; and
until this is done, all your efforts to enlighten and
e)evate Catholics, will be thwarted by these enemies
ofthe human race. Let, then, every lawful means
be 'used to accomplish this end, remembering that
it is at·~he confessional those chains are forged, ap-
plied, and ri\'etcd, which hold in bondage so large
a portion of the human (amily ; a bondage more
dre~dful than.that of the African slave, because it is
the bondage ofthe soul, which God made in his own
glorious image. .

Catholic. And it should be remembered also, that
this prelate, not having been connected· with con-
vents, knew nothing of them, save what he learned
by report, and .in his attempts to reform them ;
when, instead of the inmates being inclined to di-
vulge their own infamy, they were doubtless dis-
po_
sed, out of regard to themselves, to conceal their
deeds of darkness. Dut the case with Maria Monk
is very different. She was an inmate of the convent
.for years,·where she had every opportunity of wit-
nessing its abominations.. But ·my readers will see
enough, in all conscience, to confirm Maria Monk's
statements, in the subjoined extracts :-
" The Dominican Monks, who were members of
one' of the most numerous ecciesiastical orders, had
been the scandal of all Italy, during one hundred and
fifty years, for their total corruption.: ·and their di-
rection of the female convents had·degenerated into
a scene of the basest profligacy. Long habit had so
accustomed them to the greatest licentiousness, that

scarcely any respect for public decency remained."
-Memoirs of Scipio de Ricci, pages 96, 97, vol. i.
The nuns of Pistola testified that the monks taught
them "every kind of vice," and that they should
look upon it as a great happiness, "that they wero
able to satisfy their libidinous des·
ires, 1Ditltout the
inconvenience ofcltildren."
It was necessary to raze from the foundations a
monastery and a female convent of Carmelites,
which were in fact joined by means of subterranean
passagcs.-Vol. i. pages 98, 121.
A Hindoo brahmin, having become a Catholic
priest, says : " The R~man priests in India are like
the bonzes of Japan. The nuns arc the disciples of
Diana, and their nunneries arc seraglios for the
monks. 'fhey wcr~ more often pregnant than mar-
ried women in general. The Jesuits had be~ome
brahmins, in order to enjoy the privileges of that
caste; among which were exemption from death
for crime; and the right of enjoying the favors of
every woman who pleased them, it being commonly
received, tt.at a brahmin priest sanctifies the woman
whom he honors with his attentions."-Vol. ii:pages
216,217.
"The monks, confessors of the convents, openly
taught the Tuscany nuns atheism ; encouraged the
most disgraceful libertinism; and filled them with
impurity, sacrilege, and debauchery of the foulest
kinds. lmfllorality was thus added to profanation;
and corruption brought forth impiety. By tolera-
ting these crimes, the pope plainly announced his
indulgence of them ; and by encouraging the com- ·
mission of those iniquities, he became an accom-
pHce."-Vol. ii. pages 263, 2{)4.

" The false or forged virtues of the monks and
· nuns, are but atissue of hypocrisy, and a stimulant
to the most odious vices. The institutions called
Virginales, were schools of corruption and licen-
tiousness: and the aoi-disant tribunal of penitence
is the ·constant source of infamous wickedness, by
those impudent jugglers, whose authority depends
on the blindness of man. 'fhe monks, the nuns,
their superiors, and even the pope himsel~ not only
tolerated these disorders, but took no measures to
arrest the infidelity and impiety of those who were
daily adding new victims to their atheism and in-
ordinate voluptuoi.tsness."-Vol. ii. pages 276, 277.
But enough of such filth; for it is filth of the dark-
est die; and such as ought not to be named, did not.
the cause of humanity, virtue, and religion, demand
it, for the same reason that the Son or God divested
the ancient scribes and Pharisees, the embryo pro-
totypes of Romish priests, of their hypocritical
robes, and thus enabled the people to see that they
were "FULL OF DEAD MEN'S BONES, AND OF ALL UN-
CLEANNESS."-Matt. xxiii. 27. The Saviour knew
that there was no other way to destroy the supersti-
tious veneration with which the Jews regarded their
priests, just as the Catholics, only in a much higher
degree, regard theirs. The naming of such vices,
should be regarded Man evil, the object-of which
is the removal of a much greater one ; just in the
sense in which many a medical prescription is an
evil, absolutely necessary, however, to be adminis-
tered, 'in order to remove disease, and s~cure health.
The unqualified condemnation, therefore, ·or this
moral medicine, on the ground that some writers

B DISCLOSURES. 176
condemn the "healing art," because unskilful men·
abuse it.
Before leaving this subject, I wish to add a single
remark further. And that is this: That all the vices
spoken of by Maria Monk as practised in the Hotel
Dieu, (yea, and more too,) are abundantly inculcated
by the standard \vriters on morals of the order of
Jesuits. If:my man wishes proof of this assertion,
I would refer him, among others, to Paschal's Pro-
vincial letters, a work of' undying celebrity. Pas-
chal was himself a Roman Catholic, but opposed to
the Jesuits.
According to these moralists, a priest may com-
mit le,vdness on the ground of self-gratification ;
and then on the ground of self-defence, or defend-
ing his reputation, he may lawfully murder, deceive,
lie, and swear falsely, or employ others to do the
same for him. I know that these principles are hor-
rid beyond conception. But they are true ; and I
hold myself pledged to prove them, giving chapter
and verse, if the priests, in any responsible manner,
have the audacity to deny them.
Who, then, after reading the'preceding part of
this chapter, can seriously question the general
truth of Maria Monk's statements respef!ting the
character of the Canadian priests and nuns.? Espe-
cially when it is recollected, that a large portion of
these priests are foreign Jesuits, expelled from for-
eign countries, as an order of men too infamous to
be tolerated by civil governments. They have been
expelled, as an order of men, from almost every
country in Europe, by Catholic as well as Proteat-
ant governments. Hence they come in swarms to
the North American continent, bringing along with
....~ ,... ,...,...
176 CONFIRMATION, ETC.
them their ill-gotten gain, by which they build col-
leges, churches, nunneries, &c. The " disclosures"
· of Miss Monk, therefore, are unquestionably true,
and they would be substantially true, even if it
should he proved that she had never been a nun in
the Hot~l Dieu. This is the opini01~ ~f the 111ass of
the Protest~nt people in Canada. H is to be hoped,
therefore, that the testimony of Marin Monk wm JlO
more be disbelieved on the ground that she disclo-
ses practices so ab~~inable, as to cause virtue to
hide its blushing face at the very mention of them.
In conclusion, I will mention two facts, which
ought not to be forgotten. lst. A large number of
\he Canadian priests are Jesuits, from France: and
2d. The fact that when Bonaparte broke up the con.
:vents in France, bones of murdered infants were
'
found in great abundance. Can it then be supposed,
that the French Jesuits are any better in Canada,
than they were in France 1

CONCLUSION.
'VuA·r then is the rcsult of the whole matter 1 '.ye
lnwe, in the first place, examined the "Awful Ex-
posure):' published in defence of the Canadian priests
and nuns; and have found it to be an entire fail1.1re;
nay, we have found it to furnish strong evidence, in
confirmation of l\Iiss Monk's claims to public confi··
clence. 'l'hus also in·reference to every attempt made
hy them, for the same object. We have, in the sec-
ond place, brietly noticed the principal arguments in
support of Miss Monk's claims to our confidence, as
an ex-nun, derived from a consideration of her in-
capacity to ha\'e acted the part of an impostor-of her
minute and extensive nunnery knowledge-of her
comparative ignorance of other matters-of the m:ll'b
on her person, produced by the infliction of penance
and nunnery violence-of the forlorn condition in
which she was first discoYered in New York-of her
~upposed dying penitential confession to the Rev.
Mr. Tappin-of her consistent conduct with the de-
mands of her supposed truth-of the internal evidcncl·
of her book-of the moral impress, stamped on her
mind-of the testimony of others, direct and indirect
-of the failure of her opponents in their variccl at··
tempts of self-defence-of revelation, reason, and na-
ture-of the past history of the Roman prie~;thood
and convents. And now, I reiterate the question,
what is the conclusion? Is there a particle of ground
for suspense 1 If so, what is it? Is there a ~ingle
positio~, taken by her opponents unswept away? If
so, let It be named.
But, perhaps, some will say, after all, there is a pos-
sibility of her being false·
, of her being- an imJJC•stor,
and of cours<:>, of the p1·iests and nuns being innocent
179 CONCLUSION.
of the crimes charged upon them. Yes; there is a
possibility in the cas2; and so there is a possibility
of her heing changed into a. "pillar of salt." But
is there any probability of it 1 The ground of ration-
al conclusions, is not possibilities, but probabilities.
"\-Vhen gentlemen, in their reasonings, substitute the
former in "
pla<:e of the latter, they place themselves
beyond the limits of reason.
With reasonable men the case is different. It i3
believed that the foregoing arguments are sufficient
to establish them in the belief, that Maria Monk is
not an impostor, but is truly what she professes to be,
and that she has told substantially the truth, respect-
ing the nunnery. Such will readily perceive the im-
portance ofthe "Awful Disclosures," as a means for
opposing the conventual system, as also the spread of
popery.
Let Protestants, then, act reasonably in appropri-
ately using them for these objects. Let them remem-
ber the deplorable state of more than one half of
Christendom, in c!onsequence of popery. Let them
look at wretched starving Ireland. Let them behold
bleeding and distracted Spain, as well as South
America. Let them consider the ignorance, poverty,
and oppression, of papal countries in general. Let
them call to mind the condition of Canada ; a vast
majority of whose inhabitar~ls are s~ ignor-clnt, as to
be incapable of either reading or writing their names.
They are sunk not only in ignorance, hut in vice.
Intemperance abounds to a fearful extent, the priest!!,
their spiritual guides, setting them the example. Ler
the American people especially, open their eyes upon
their own beloved country, and see with what rapid
strides, popery has been spreading itself, for a ft!w
years past, over the length and breadth of the land.
Let them count the number of its churches, mass-
houses, convents, colleges1
academies, and newspa-
pers, all devoted to the dissemination of a religion
which is fundamentally h~tile to every thing that is
truly American. Let them count the number of its
devotees, all of them marsb1_1lted and kept in the most
abject subjection to these foreign Jesuits; ready to

go anywhere, or to do any thing which their upprin-
cipled leaders may direct. And then, let them 1e- '
member, that the God of their fathers bas put into
their hands, this powerful instrumentality, with
which they may oppose and break the unholy power
of the Roman priests in their countrv.
Before ~;losing, I wish to offer a single remark re-
specting the following work of Miss MonJe. It ha~
been written by the same worthy gentleman that
penned her first volume; and great care has been ex-
ercised in writing it, to give to the community""nothing
but the simple statements of the authoress. 'fhe
subject matter is hers. '\Vith reference to this point,
I speak with the more confidence, from the fact, that
it has been written, since she came to reside with the
people of my pastoral charge. _
And nc·.-.·, in conclusion, I would guard the public
against being mi:;led by the deceptive arts of Roman
priests. They undoubtedly will do something forth-
with for the purpose of weakening the impression,
which the following "Disclosures" are adapted to
make. They will be ready perhaps, to swear that they
are a translation from some old Portuguese work ;
or that there never \vas such a priest as the murdered
L'Esperance ; or that there is no such place as the
lslam1
. described ; or, perhaps, it being in the dead of
the winter, when a \'isit to Canada and such an ex··
amination of the nunnerie5:, subterranean passages,·
Seminary, and the Black Nuns' Island, as has been
proposed to make, would be attended with extreme
difficulty, they may possiblr offer a compliance with
the conditions, specified by the meeting, held in New
York, in Aug-ust, 1836. A bewildering flourish of
some sort or other will unquestionably be made ; but
it is hoped that the communitv will remember the
decepth•e tricks heretofore practised on them by the
priests, and that all further ones will be disregarded.

PREFACE.
TnE following pages contain disclosures
relating to various persous and scenes, many
of which were not alluded to in my former
volume. Some of these facts I-did not consider
important; and of others I felt a strong reluc-
tance to speak. I have at length come to the
conclusion to add tluis much to the L'lcts I have
laid before the American public, under a belief
t~mt it is likely to prove usefttl.
Siuce the greater part ·of the following pages
were prepared for the press, my character and
t!1e t!uth of my book have been strongly at-
tacked by several persons. I do not entertain
a~y unkind feelings towards such as may be
honest in opposing me, nor do I fear the result;
for I know I am Speaking the truth, and they
will soon become convinced, and ·acknowledge
their error.
I have only to ofier to my opponents the
following chapters,· in which they will find
more facts to meet,.new scenes and personages
to explain or justify. If they should accuse
1ne of deriving these also from the I\iontreal
Magdalen A~ylum, I hope they will not keep
the place closed, nor disperse or conceal the
inmates, as they have done since they publish-
ed such a charge against the "Awful Disclo-
stues."

Besides, I hav.e .some~imea h•d to feel very keen·
ly _the effects of my aelf-contiction; for, in more
than one instance, I have heard disparaging re-
marks thrown out by the inconsiderate or unfeeling. '
Perhaps it is not to be wondered at, then, in spite of
the resolution I had formed, of making known
my ex}iericnc;~ _
to, tqe .wor~d,_,_if I ~h~u14 _
have felt,
at aome periods, adesire for retirement and tran·
quillity, in some place, no. nuatter how humble,
where I might be free from trials like these.
At a period a little preceding the publication of
the tint edition of my book, I was much di~uieted
by the circumstances in which I found ·myself. I
felt extremely uncertain what Teeeption awaited me,
and supposed that in case 'public incredulity should
render the sale of my book very small, ~should be
' involved in heavy pecuniary' responsibilities. with·
out the -remotest h'ope of deliverante. What the
Jaws of the country mi_ght.~o~demn me·to, in such
·a case, I knew··not; but I -·sometimes:apprehended

distance being short from my lodgings, although

was ,Father Phelan; and he !lC~osted me with

keep on my guard, f(.-e~ing some dread of placing
myself in his power.

the character he gave of the lady,. I did not foTget.

When we separated, he requested me to see him
again, near the same place : but I did not comply
with that desire. A considerable time afterwards, a
letter was brought to my lodgings, by two boys~ ,
which bore some marks of his; but I am unable to
eay ·with certainty, whether he WM the writer or not.

I consented to an introduction, as did those' fritnds

at first in a manner correspoQding 'Yith what I had
been led to expect. But on one or .two oc:~asions,
when no one else was present, he intimate~ senti·

Not long after my last interview with :Father

gone back to Canada, I formed the resolution one
day ofcalling on Mrs. B., of·whom he had.spoken.,
in ·such favorable terms. I found the house. ui'
which sh~ had lodgings without difficulty ; and, 0~
introducing myself to her, met with·a;very.kind .and
·friendly··reception. I ·had been afraid to gcq~e~ ,

· ·It happened, that owing to ..Circumstances similar
to ·some,I have before ·detailed, some time in ·the
month of May,··1836,-I made ~p my mind,'that I
had better withdraw, if possible, from the excitement
and.trials to which·I had been so long subject, and
retire·into obscurity.in some country p]ace, where I
might·spen4 my ,life unknown. I thought that I
had p~rhaps done all my duty-1 had revealed u
much as·,vould be believed. In.this strife of mind,
1 naturally recalled a·fiattering offer m~de to me by
inuncle one day, in ·August, 1835, ~uring my visit
to Montreal, after my exertions.to bring my charges
to a ;legal ··investigation .had.fa~led. I thought I
might 8afely ·apply to hi~. l accordingly wrote
him·a letter, requesting him;'·if he could, to come to
·New York.and remove me,to some retreat such·u
I have described ; and taking it to Mn. B's, asked
.her to'forward 'it for me to Canada. This wu 11

w~ich I·thought would effectually secure.me (rom

dread as ever. :.If; Father ·Phelan had even made
the most distant·suggestion·.in favor ·of it, that alone
would have been sufficientto deter mefrom deciding
upon its·'adoption. . Mrs. B. took my. letter with
readiness;and promised to forward it to Canada.
. After a few:days,:f..called again, when Mrs. B.
gave me a ·letter ·fJ'om :my·uncle, in which he ac·
knowledged the receipt of mine, and expressed.his
willingness to comply with my..wishes; b~t said I

claring that I could never consent to tru~ myself in

in town. I replied that.I could not believe it; soon
after which she said he was .in sight in the street,
and a penon entered directly afterward1, ,whom I
.recognised as him. My feelings almost overcame
me.· Whatever was the cause, I was quite u~ble
to apeak, and could hardly stand. His unexpected
appearance in so sudden a manner, filled my mind
with many painful thoughts and apprehensions; and
I immediate!y began to realize that I had in .fact 11
great repugnance to a step which I had before con-
'aidered·as ·easy a~d pleasant. Some of my frienda
had solemnly warned me against trusting myself.in
the power of any one from Canada, without sQme
good security; and the thought of what might be my
.fate in case I should, when too late, find my confi-
dence betrayed, quite overpowered me:. At the same
time, the sight of a person .just from Montreal,- re-
vived many of th~: IJ!-OSt distressing recollections. I
was able at length·to master my feelings, and en-
gag-ed in conversation wit.h my uncle..
He spoke as if he expected·to take me offwithout
delay, and appeared surprised when I expreae4 ~
doubt ofbeing ready immediately. Afterconversing
together for a time in the house, we walked out, and
conferred at.leisure on several.topics interesting to
me;. He·.told ·me, that although ~e had at ·first
thought only of having me with him at his residence
near.Mo.ntr~l, as I preferred ~ot to return there,
he~· willing to change·his abode; and woul_
d re-
move to Vergennes,,in 'V~rm.on~ . ,f I ~hose. Being
a bachelor, he equid euily ;t.~ange his reaj4eu~;
...·~·-- ,

and he was willing to repeat.to me the propositions
he.had made to nie while in Montreal-last summer,
viz. to 'support me and my child·for life, give me
tho care of his household,.in place of his -house·
keeper, without requiring me to contradict any tbing
I had.said, aJthough I had n.ow published abook, and
then:h~d only made an affidavit. The only condition
hewould require ofme, was, that I should henceforth
be silent about those things which bad given me S()
much .ti'ouble,iand nevl'r publish any 'thing more
about 'the-Nunnery. He seemed to .think that I
sbo'uld thus ·
save myself much vexation and anxiety;
not intimating·at all that he·wished me to be ,silent
on account of the priests, whose part he.did not pre-
tend· to take.' So far; indeed,"'was my uncle from
ap~ring'. as their advocate, ·that he cursed·them
wh~never ·they were spoken·of, and seemed to bav~
not much·better opinion of them than I had.
. He spol'e also of my b~ok,·· an'd of the measures
.taken in relation to it, as ·\veU ns of my being award

showed a

Before my uncle parted from me, he told me I
might say, if any of my friends inquired about him,
that he was soon going to New Haven for nine days. _
He went to within a short distance of my lodgings,
and then appointed to meet me the next day at a
ho~se in Chrystie street, where I understood lodged
aMiss F., a friend of Mrs. B. Some of my friends '
whom I informed .,of my interview-with ·my uncle,
were incredulous, thinking it was not himself, be-
ing apprehensive that some plan was on foot to get
me into the power of my enemies. · They therefore .
began to pu~ some impediments in my way, object~.·
iog to my leaving ho~e, and endeavoring to amuse
me in the house. The next day, however, I called
at the house indieated by my uncle, where I found
Miss F. in company with my uncle and two other
men, one of whom, a tall man, somewhat lame, I
recognised as Mr. F.,her brother. Thi1 man I had

CHAPTER IV.
• I
Anini of•veral Caftldlane-Intemew• wUb them. ·
I BAD but a short interview with my'uncle that
day, and soon returned home, without speaking to
either o(the other men. I asked him, however, ·who
they were, arid ·he inform~ me that they had lately
arrived &om Canada, on a·mere ?isit. I inquired
whether they came with him; andI now iemember
that he did not answer, but spoke of something else.
~he neit day, as I w!l·
s walking in that part of the
city,_I was met by"those two m~n, wh~ addreSsed me'
with cordiality; saying, they had leamed from my
uncle that I intended to leave the city and live with ~;
him. They said he .was a good maD, and they
thought it would be a wise. step on my part. I
should by all means accept of his propositions ; but
I ought to avoid the Catholics. " But,"· said I, ·
K what are you but C~tholics ,, They smiled,
answered, "Ah, but we are not such as you
fear-we ion't ·coUnt ourselves Catholics."' ·
They'told me that my uncle would perhaps want
to. ~c me occasionally, if l did not go at ~nee; and
proposed to fix on some way in which he might
give me information. They thoughtthe best nieau
woUld be by writing, and leaving a note in some
•ft: and convenient place. They said it'w~uld.:~ .
betternot to have my uncle introduced to my fii~
;
AT'l£111PTS TO ABDt1C'I'
because they \VO&lld probably wish to prevent my
departure.
All this time they did ~ot urge me to go, but eon·
atantly spoke of my journey as of what I had freely
determ·ined on, and on which they would not infiu·
cnce me, except so far as to express their approba-
ticn of my decision, anlf to say, that the s~oner I
~vent, the better it would be for m·
e. SeforeJhey left
me, they mentioned that one or two other Canadianr
were .in the c.ity, wh~m they thou~ht I might 1ikij
to' see. 1made no objection to seeing ~hem, as they
said they felt a friendly interest in me, and would be
pleased to have ~n interview.
. They tol~ me nlso, that while I remai~ed where
I was. they, as well as my uncle, would .feel much
anxiety for me, .and. would wish to he:assured of my
welfare. very frequently.; for they had so bad an
opinion.of 'those who profes$ed .so muc.h friendship
for me,that they believed they had very'evil designs,
and would·be glad to murder me. I could not per·
sunde them that .this was out of the question, and .
, .·· · i!lsisted that in order to satisfy them;they must
. e some way in which they could ascertain f1·om
time to time whether I was still·in my present lodg·
ings, ~nd. alive an'd ·well. They propose~ that I
should spen.d.muc4 of my time in my chamber, the
window of which they got me to 'point out to ,them;
and to appeali at it whenever I might see .my uncle or
eith~r. o(~hem p~ning. In case they had any writ·

l had made up my mind so decidfdly in favor of
leavi~g New York, and placing myself under my
uncle's protection, that I gave sevE1ral of my.friends
distinctly to understand that such was my intention.
as I have before stated. Fearing that their mis·
judged kindness (as I then considered it) might
raise ·embarrassments in my way, I however did not
intend to communicate .to them the exact period.
when I intended to leave ihem. Indeed, I did not
myself agree with my uncle on any precise day and
hour. until a few days beforehand. He passed my
lodgings on Sunday, the 22d of May, and stopped to
converse with me. We then pitched upon Wednes·
dny. tbe 25th of May, at._
- o'clock in the nfternoon.
At that time I was to meet him at Mrs. B's i or if
any thing prevented, I was to go. where .I could

bring with tne, when he would be prepared soon to
remove me bey()nd the reach of pursuit or inquiry..
I had been under much excitement and disquieiude
for'many days, and my trouble only increased as the
period approached. I haddone muC"h to try the frie~d­

against the intentions I had·avowed; but their interest

I did not inform them when I intended to set out
on my ]oumey, but they had a suapicion of it.
· l was at home on the afternoon of Sunday, May
22, and while I was sitting at the parlor window,
my uncle and another man stopped before .me
on the sidewalk, and began ~o talk with me. My
uncle proposed to m~ to leave tbe house and go with
him. He said, Mr. S. is now in ~burch, you can
eome !iS well as not. I replied that I would not go
without my child. He inquired where it wa1, and
I told him a girl had taken it to Williamsburgh. He
mad~ particular inquiries about the time when she
wa~ to return, the way, and the appearance and dress
of the girl, to which I readily replied. He then
soon left me, with his companion.
·After a time, the girl returned with my babe ; and
of her own accord began to tell us that she had been
much alarmed by the conduct of a man who had
accosted her on board the ferry boat. She described
him in such a way as to convince me that it could
be nobody but my uncle. He had approached her,
spoke of the chil~, o1ferecl to take it in his arms,
called it his own, spoke to it, played with it, and
was hardly to be prevented from ~king it away
from her. She was unwilling to give its mother's
name in the boat, and suppressed it, but refused to
part wit~ it, saying she was ~ot permitted to let a
stranger take it. The man, however, at length be·
carne ~0 urgent, that she was obliged to tell him .
she ~ould c.ertainly call for help if he did not deaiat.

I DID not inform my friends of the time we had'
agreed on for my departure, for that I feared would
entirely'defeat my intention. I sometimes felt a little
doubt o( the kindness of their feelings, so ·many
imputations had bee1,1 cast upon their motives.by my
uncle an~ his a~quaintances. Even when 1believ~d
them sincere, I thought they misJudged concerning
~y real interests. . From something that took place,·
as I since have learned, my friends were very suspi-
cious that.I intended.to leave them on Wednesday;
and they were dou·bly watchful of me that day.
Knowing my unwillingness to ~e st>parated from
my babe, they fe)t little uneasint>sS about my leaving
them, so long as th~y had her in their possession ;
and I found an opportunity to go round to Mrs. B's
ab~ut .S o'clock on Viednesday, to request my
uricJe to wait for me in a carriage at a near point,.
where it would be more convenient to join ·him in
three-quarters of an hour. I then set·off for home
to get my babe, he accompanying me a partiof the
way. 'I stopped·a little in Grand str~et; to wait for
an omnibus; when I 'felt a wish to see a family once
more whose resi4ence was near, and from whom I
had received·many_
marks of disinte~ested kitidness."
I went in and told them I had ealJed to take' leave,

as' I expected soon to leave New York. They
were a little apprehen~ive, as I since have learnt,
that I might then be on the eve ofmy departure, and
wishing to detain me as long as pouible, urged me
to sit again when I rote to depart. Their urgency
wu 10 strong that I complied, and twice afterwards
waa persuaded again to seat myself. At length I
got away, and haste.ned home to get my infant; but
here I had t·
o encounter a new delay. .Two of my
female acquaintances were in the house alone ;. and
when I entered I hoped they would not oppose my
wf:ahea. · To my disappointment, however, they made
decided opposit~on to my getting poueaaion of my
child, good·nnturedly it is true and with every ex·
preaaion ofinterest in her and myself, but so resolute·
ly that I could do nothing. A~ length, after an hour's
delay, I g~t my babe into my arms, and praceeded
to the comer ofAvenue D and Houston street, where
I wu to have met my uncle about two hours before.
He was not there, but I presumed had got weary
of waiting for me, and per~apa becoming suspicious
of my intentic;ms, might have gone away in disgust.
At a comer not far otf, I.waa accosted by three of
the Canadians I have before spoken of, though,
such was the excitement of my f~~lings, I cannot
remember which they were. 'fhey told me my
uncle had been waiting for me atthe time appointed,
and that they were ~illing to go and requeit him to
wait for me at Mrs. B's,.at the same time advising
me to get into an omnibus. They i~medi~tely

made no one to aasiat me in carryingthem. Leaving mf

ings ; but on reaching them, I found that my depar-·
ture with my infant had caused much excitement
among my friends. O;De ofthem had already gone
to the ~lice to preYent. ~ pOssible, my departure
from the city; and the news ~ been communicated·
tosomeofthenewspaperoffices,under the full peraua·
sion that I had been unsuapec:tingly decoyed into the ·
power ofmy enemies, andthat. ifl were once got ·out
ofthecity, I should probably neve~ again be heard of.
The two kind females whom I again found alone
in the house, were therefore rejoiced to see me
apin, but theywere much more resolute than before
in oppoa~ng my Wishes. One of them stepped out
and called her brother to her aid, who promptly
cam~, arid in~erposed· auch. i~pediments to my leav·

: I afterwards learnt that. some·ot: my friends, wli01
~d heard from me that my uncle and other persori&-
from Canatla. were making .a~·!Biigenients for' my
departure from.New York,.had cons~lted 'on having:-
them apprehended.. Application was: first made t()
one of the city mag.ist:J;~tes, but .he·gave it·as his
opinion that whatever suspicion.might:lie had,.there·
was not evidence eno.~gh·to act up~~·-. A:.lawyer·
was consulted,by another of my.frien.ds, wlio rec.om·
mended the immediate adoption of measurcs.for their·
apprehensi~n i in. conseque~ce of which, ll'eapplied'
at the upper police. .The magistrate, after· Jl:~arlilg­
thc state of things, thought t~e circum~tances very:·
· strong, and that they gave room to presume that 1t
serious plot.had been formed to get me.away. He
called the next day to converse with me, accompa·
nied by another person ; but when he had considered
the circumstances at leisure, he remarked that they
appeared to have kept just w~thi~ the bounds of Jaw,
and never to have transgressed, so that theyhad not
committed any overt act which mjg~t have rendered
them amenable. He expressed surprise at the evi·
de~ce he found .of the~r caution, and said it was
cJear to ~im that they had betn acting under .flrst
ratt advict.
I confess that it was pleasing to me, that they
were not to be proceeded agains.ti for it \ns pain'ful

strongly· urged by ··some ·of the Catholic \Vomen
about me. It happenetl, mo.st fortunately for .me,
that I was befriended and advised by an excellent
'\Voinan, Mrs. Neil, who took great pains to instru~
and influence me aright. When I had decided on
ebeying the -summons of the priest, Mrs. Neil: came
in: and having ascertained my intention, urged me
1o· reflect, and impressed ·it upo11 my mind, that I
'\vas responsible·to God, BSld ·not to man, for my con·
~uct, and that his power and authority over me were
cnly .pretended. ' ·I believe I had then sometimes
more confidence in -pril-sts than in God Almighty.

Since the first appearance ·of my book,. I have re·
ceived visits from a greaf number.o{persons in con·
sequence of what they bad seen or heard of its con·
tents ; and among these. have ·been a .considerable
nutnber of Catholics. .·While I am able to say that
I have had the satisfaction of removing all doubts
from the minds of some Protestants whom·I have
seen, I must confess that in general I have received
the greatest satisfaction from interviews with intelli·
gent Catholics. The reason of.this is, that I know
better how to treat the latter in argument. Having
been one myself, I lino\V where their difficulties
lie, how to appeal ·to their own minds, ~ nod. ho\v
to lead them to correct ~onclusions. .Perhaps I can
best convey my meaning to my readers, by,gi~ing a
brief account of.some oft~ interviews alluded to.

need not say that I tremblefor her fate.
During"the first week in March; 1836, I received
a visit at my lodgings i1_1 New York, from a young
woman, of a Protestant family in this city, who had
received a Roman Catholic education. She called,
as I understood, at the urgent request of her mother,
who was exceedingly distressed at her daughter's
intention to enter a Canadian nunnery.
Part-of our interview was in private; for she re-
quested me to retire whh her a little time, where
we might be alone ; and I ·found her intention wns,
by certain queries, to satisfy herself whether I had
ever been a Roman Catholic. She inquired if I
could tell any of the questions. commonly asked of
women in the Confession box;. and on my answer-
ing in the affirmative, she desired me to repeat some,
··which I did. This satisfied her on·that point; and
[ soon became so far ·acquainted with the state of her
mind, as to perceive that she was prepared to avoid
the -influence of every argument that I could use·
against the system to ·which she had become at-
tached. ,.· - ~.
· She confessed to .me, that she had given five hun-
dred dollars to the Cathedral, and n considerable
sum to St. Joseph's Church, and that she had decided
on entering a ·nunriery in Canada. I inquired why
she did not enter one in the Unittld States. To this
1he replied, that she hnd only one objection; her

greatly preferred the former, because the priests hntf

they had not of those' i(l ·the States. This, and.

me. Her complexion was dark, and of an unnatu·
r~l eolor, her look strange, and she occasionally
itarted and conducted very singuhirly indeed, though
abe never spoke.· Her whole·appearance was such
as to··make me· think she had lo$t her reason, and
almost terrified me. The ~uperior informed us that
she wanted us as \Vitnesses ; and the priests then
coming f~rward, presented the paper to Miss ·Duran·
qttau, and asked her if she was willing to give'aU
her property to the church. She replied with a feeble
motion of die head an4·body, and then, having a pen
put into··her hands, wrote her name to it without
reading it, and relapsed ·into ·apparent unconscious·
nt-ss. we were then requested to add our signa·
tures, which being done, we withdrew~. as we enter•
ed, I be1ieve without the sick novice having had any
knowledge of our.presence, or of her own actio~s.
A few hours afterwards I \vas called -to assist in
laying~out her corpse, which was·the first intimation
I·had· of her being dead. .The 'Superior, myself.
and one or hvo other novices, had the whole ofthis
mela_
neholy tnsk to perform, being tb'e only persons
admitt~d into' the apartment where the body Jay. ·
Inws swelle~ very much. We placed it in a cof·
fin, and screwed on the·cover alone. On account of
the rapid·chang.
e taking plaee in the corpse, it was
burie~ about twenty 'four hours after death.
Not long after the bu-ri.al, two brothe~ of Miss
Duran"eau came to the Convent, and were greatly
distressed when te;>ld that she was dead. They com·
plaiDed of'not being 'informed of her sickness: but

the Superior aiaured them that it wa• at the urgent
requeat of their siatet, .who wu poueued of so
much humility, that abe thought heraelf qnwortby
of a&ttaeting the regard ot any one, and not fit to

-lleans taken to persuadfl her to atay. ·.;:....
THERE was a young girl; named Ann, who was
very stouL and rather homely, but not of pleasing
manners, ihough of a good disposition, seventeen or
eighteen years of age, to whom I took a liking.
She·_
was a. novice with me, and the time of which I
am to speak, was not long after I returned -from St.
Denis.....The Superior also displayed a partiality for
her, and I found she was much in favor of having
her received as a nun, if it could be accomplished.
She was very handy at different kinds of work; and,
what I believe chiefly induced me to-.regard her
wi~h<·kindness, she was a fatherless and motherless
child. She had a beau in town, who one day
cal1ed to see her at the nunnery, when she was
going to confession.
·.·I was with the Superior at the 'time, who, on be-
ing informed that the·· young man was there, and of
his errand~ requested me to go into the parlor with
her, to meet him. - ·He put into the Superior's hands
a parcel and: three letters, :requesting ·her to give
them to Ann. . She .took thorn,.with ·an expression
of assent, and he withdrew. Just as he had gone,
Ann came hurrying into the parlor, saying th~t

her. · The Superior rebuked her sharply, and scut
her back; without, however, showing her what she
had promised to give her. Ann eaid, that she had
understood a young man (mentioning. her visiter)
had called to see her. 'fhis the Superior denie~,
telling her never to come till she was wanted.·
When Ann had gone, the Superior told. me t~ go
with her to her room, which .I did. She there first
made me promise never to tell of ''"hat she wns go-
ing to do, and then produced the letters and pacl,agt>,
and began to open them. One of the letters, I re-
' member, was folded in a.singular manner, and fast-
ened with three seals. In the parcel was foul\d a
miniature ofthe young man, a pair of ear . ring~ a
·breast pin, and something else, what, I have now for-
gotten. 'rhe letters were addressed to ,her by her
lover, who advised her-by all .means to leave the
Conve~t. · He informed her that a cousin of hers, a
tailor, had arrived from Scotland, who was in wa~t
of a housekeeper; and ut·ged l1er to live with.him,
and never renounce the Protestant r(>)igion in which
she had been .brought up. ',
I was surprised that the Superior should do what
I felt to be..very wrong and despicable; but she re-
present~d ·it as perfectly justifiable on account oftbc
good which shc ·had in view. '"·. ,.
I :considered myself as bound to be particu]arly
obedient ~o the Superior, in order that I might make
my ·t.onduct .correspond w~th the character giyen of
me·to her, by Miss Bousquier, who, as I have men-
tioned in the sequel. of my first vo]ume, hod sho":n

me back into the nunnery. This was a

eing her to talie the veil, and to proceed in ·accord-
ance with the direc.tions given me.. T~e Superior
told me by.no means to make any npproache_
s to her
at once, nor indee~ for some time, lest she sho1:1ld
suspect our design ; but to \yait awhile, ~ntiL.she
could have no reason to think_
~y n~ovements might
·have grown out of the circumstances abo\'e mention-
ed: for Ann appeared to be uncommonly penetrating,
as the Superior remarked ; an.d of course much cau-
tion was.necessary in denling with hef. Some.time
subsequently, therefore, I cannot tell exactly .how
loQg, I engaged in ,conversation with her o·ne day,
in the course of which she remarked that Miss
Farns, a confidential .friend of hers, ,who had spent
'a short t!me in the nunnery some time before, was
soon coming back.
This Miss Farns had come in on trial, while I
wns in the Convent, and I had often heard ~he Su-
perior say, that she must be separated from .A,~n.
because they were ao much together, and so oft(>n
breaking the rules. Ann .now told me in confi-
denc~, that her. friend was coming back, not w~th
any:real intention oLstaying, but o~ly for the p~r·
pose ofgiving.her some info"!lati.on favor!ible to her.
self, which she had obtnined. This she wished to

tie delicacies, with directions to share them with
·Ann. · Miss Farns soon· presented herse)f for rc.
admission, and was admitted without any difficulty,
not being required'even to change her dress. This
occurred, as· nearly as I can recollect, about six
· weeks after the affair of intercepting Ann's letters,
mentioned a few pEiges back, and somewhere about
the close of summer; or the.beginning of autumn.
Being a.Bowed 'to do pretty much as they chos(',
Ann and her friend were much together, and gen.
crally engaged in deep conversation:' so that, as the
Supeiior declared, it was evident they were forming
some plan for secret operations. I tried several
times to get near and overhear what they were talk·
ing about : but I could not ]earn any thing. The
next day .Miss Farns departed, saying.she never in·
tended to return; which offended the Superior so
rnu~h, that she ~aid she \vould have the doors shut
if she ever came again.·
The same evening Ann requested me to tell the
Superior, that she wished to get her clothes, that
she might lenv~ the Convent. I went to the Supe·
rior's room, where I found Father 'Bonin sitting on
the sofa tal.king '!ith her. Whrn theywereinformed
of Ann's message, the·Sup,erior said, she would let
the girl go at once back to the world;.arid be given
up to the devil. . Bonin argued n·good deal against
this. The Superior replied; tha't she -hnd set the old
nuns af'\vork, 'bui with~n~t. success; they had not
beeri able to influence Ann as she desired·; and it

she decided on the course to pursue; and turning
to me, said : take·her up stairs, give her her clothes,
yet argue with her in fa\'or ofremaining in the Con·
vent, but at the same time tell her, that I am indif-
ferent about it, and care not whether she goes or
stays.
I accordingly returned to Ann, and telling ber that
she might follow me up stairs and get her clothes,
led the way, and delivered them to her. In obedi.
ence to my orders, ~ lost no time in representing
her intentions to depart from our holy residence as
an insinuation of the devil ; and told her that he
was trying his best to draw her out into the world, .
that he might secure her for himself. I told herthut .
he had a strong hold upon her, and she ought to use
the greater exertions to resist his temptations i that.
the Superior thought it might be better on the whole
if she departed, because her:influenc~ ~ight be very
jnjurious to others if she remained; .yet that I felt. a
deep interest in her, and could not bear to have her
perform her intention, because.I well knew that bel'
throwing off the holy dress that she then wore, to
take her former one, would be the first step towards
damnation.
'' You need not talk so to me," replied Ann, " you
have done the same yourself:" I told her that if I had,
Ihad lived to l'egret it, and was glad to get back
to the Convent again. After a while an old nun
came· up, called me asi~e, and said the Superior
wished me to continue tall<ing with Ann i and, in

her go down nnd beg pardon for the scandal she
had caused bv her ('.Qnduct, I and ask to be taken
back again i~to the fleck of the good shepherd, as
the Superior was ofte1i cnlled.
Poor Auil at length began to listen to me; and I
got her to repent to me all that Miss Farns had said to
hcr··during her .late'short Yisit to the nunnery. The

to go CtO"'n stairs as n penitent, and there she hum.

mornings, ask forgivenl"BS ofall her compnnions 00

That evtmirig the Superior called me to te:i in her

THERE was a girl whom I knew from a child, n
Miss' Ross, the recollection of whom gives I,De, deep
pain: for I kn~w too welhhat I have been the cause of
great'misfortunes to her. I remember being with
her ~t 'different ·tirnes iri my early days. After our
famfly ~emoved to Montreal, and had our residence
in-.the' Government House, we often had calls from
persons of our acquaintance, as many were fond of
walldng in the garden, or green, as \\·e commonly
called it. -
Such of rny readers as have visited that city will
be likely to remember the place of our residence:
for the Government House, of which my mother is
still the keeper, is ofvery large size: (I have some.
times heard it spoken of as the most ancient in
America.) It wos said that the foundation stones of
that and the old French church were laid on the
snme day, as recorded. The gnteway is of stone,
and it is furnished in a manner becoming the resi-
dence of the Governor of the· Province. The gar.
den and green are of great extent, and present fine
walks and flowers; and as the former overlooks
the·esplanade, to which it is adjoining, it was a favor·
ite resort on Sunday afternoons, when the troops are
'on parade.

Min Ross, I recollect, one ·c,·ening in p:lTticuJnr,
paid m·e a Yisit ,v_
ith a Miss Robinson; and we
nmuscd ourselyl'S together in the green. Her moth~
er lived a little out of the city, ncar the Lachine road.
She was a Sl~Otch lady, and possessed a large pro.
perty. 'Vhen Miss Ross grew up, she became·at·
tached to a young man of my acquaintance, and in·
deed a -relation of my moth~r; but when it became
known,·she found her mother very much opposed
to her wishes. ·
While I was a novice·in the Hotel Dieu, Miss
Ross came in ns 'one:; and .we·had ft·equent inter- ··
views together, ns our ·acquaintance still'continued,
and indeed we hnd ·always been friends. She be··-
enme informed of' my design ·of taking the black
reil-I presume·I must·have told her of it myself; '
and one dny'she told me; that she had sometimeS
tho1Jght of becoming a nun, but still felt but little in· -
clination that way ; yet she requested me to do her ,
the ·favor to inform her ho-\v ·I was pl~ased with
that· mode of life;·after I shot;~ld h1.1ve b_
een in ·long
enough to fot·m ·an opinion. If I thougbt sho would·-
be happy as a nun, she desired 1·would frankly in- -
form her; and if not-as I was acquainted ·with her
disposition-that I \vould warn her ngainst it. We ,
often conversed on the ·subject aften'vards; and ir:
was repeated, and plainly und~rstood between 'u$,
that I wa! to tell -her the exact truth, as she would
probably be guided entirely l!y my opinion in the
course she would adopt. · ·
I werit through many preparatory steps before my
58 BLACK· NU!\ta.. \'.
admission, as I have mentioned in my first volumt,
took the veil, and passed through soma of the Rcenea
which I have before spoken of, before I ever particu·
larly reverted to tha request of Miss R9ss, so fnr ns
I .now can remember. One thing, how..,ver,•I here
stop to mention, \vhich I omitted to say h; my first
volume, and wllich I might forget bereafter, \'iz :-
that soon after tpy admission as a " Received," the
Superior gave me .the charge of her room, that of
the old ·nuns,.ond the adjo~ning community-room;
a~d· thus kept ~e for about three months in a degree
more separate from the other nuns, than I should
othe!wise have been. This bro~:~ght me more into
intercourse with the Superior, and in the sam~ pro·
portio_
n made some Q~her nuns regard me with jelll·
ousy: for some of them occasionally, in some way
or other, would express dislike towards me. Per·
haps this state of thing:l the. more disposed me to
confide in the Superior.
After l had been a nun for some weeks, I cannot
tell f!xactly ho~v long, I recollect that as I lay awake
one night, I b~gan to think .
of .Miss Ross, nnd to re·
call the conversations we hnd held together in the
novices' apartment. ~llat once it occurred to me
that I might proBably~ do a great benefit to myself,
·an honor to tho nunnery.and to true religion, ns
well as save her, by inducing her to take the blaclc
veil, especially as she had so much property to add
to·the funds. At the io.'lme time the thought present·
ed itself to my mfnd, that by so doing I should gain a
very exalted place .h1 ,he.A.~~n for myself: for I had

read the same in our book, that to bring a persQn
into a Convent. was one of the high€'st kinds of mer·
it. I soon made up my mind to communicate to the
Superior all I knew; for although I questioned nt
once whether it would not be shameful nnd sinful to
betray the confidence of my friend, this was easily
got over, by the thought of the vnst benefits to result
from it, especially to herself.
The next day I told one of the old nuns that I ·
wished to speak with the Superior: for as this wna·
commonly required, and nuns could not go into her
room without leave, I conformed to custom. I wils
SOOR admitted, when I told hE"r all Miss Ross had
said to 111€', nnd added, that I wished to get her to
take the veil. I apologized for my private.conver·
sations. She said they were perfectly justifiable.-
1think I never saw the Superior express more sat.
isfaction than .she did on the receipt of this intelli·
gence. She appeared overjoyed; listened to all I
had to say with great attention, and highly appro·
ved of my proposition. 'Vhen I informed her of
Miss Ross's attachment to young , she repli·
ed that that might explain the state of her mind ; for
the old nuns had for some time spoken of her de·
pressed appearance, and she hnd mentioned at con·
fession that something lay very heavy on her mind.
The Superior appeared from that'•moment to de·
vote her whole attention to the consideration of the
subject. She seemed for a time almost lost in
thought; ami Tt'markcd to me, "'Vc must consider .

thil matter; we must consider the best way to bring·
her into the nunnery : for some persons are harder
to get out of the devil's power than others. After
a little time she told me 1should be sent to read thA
lecture to the novices, and she would tell the old
nuns to allow me to converse with Min Ross, which
they would not let me do, as I well knew, without
her express orders, as it was contrary to th~ rules.
She then told me many things to say to Miss Ross,
and some of her instr~ctions she repented to me, so
that I might not be at a lo8s when I should converse
with her, no matter what objections she might raise.
Among other things which I most distinctly rc·
collect, _
she told me to assure her, thnt as to the hnp·
piness of a Convent, no person could possibly be ..
more happy than nuns; for there we were assured
of the fav~r of God, and of heavenly enjoyments af.
ter death; that while in the world, other young wo.
men would dl'!lw us off frotl} our ' .tty, and occupy
our minds with thoughts that would do us harm :
there we were exposed to no such dangers. 'fhe
~ sinfulness of vain thoughts might appear to us very
trifling, but it was very different in the sight of God;
nnd how could we hope to resist the temptations
surrounding us in .sucli a manner in the world 1
. \ .•
If she made any nllus~Gn to her attachment to the
young man before me!ltioned, the Superior told me
to declaim against it, as an abomination to think o(
suc;h a thing in the nunnery ; that I could not con.
verse with her if she spoke of it again, as not a
p~:oper person. If she appeared to hesitate nt my

proposition, I was to tell her solemnly, that my offer
waa a direct invitation from Jeaus Chri1t to become
his apouse, which could not be rejected without
great guilt. . ,
The Superior.told me that I should be richly re·
warded if I s~cceeded. She thought I would soon
be made an old (or confidential) nun; and she would
give me a most precious relic, with a piece of tho
heart of Mary Magdalen, and int<.>rcedc for me with
the Virgin.
After I had listened attentively to all these in·
structions received from a woman to whom I looked
with unbounded respect ·nnd venerotien, I left her,
prepared to put them into practice to the best of my
ability, much excited with the hope of accomplish·
ing what I thought a truly great and meritorious
act, and one that would ensure the salvation of my
friend.
'rhe reader may perhllps here recall the disclo· .
Rures I have heretofore made, of the crimes I bad
witnessed, and the sufferings I had undergone before
this period of my convent life, and wonder ho\v I
could p~ibly have been ao far deluded, as really to
believe what I was thus prepared to say. Such,
however, is indeed.the truth; except that I .111ust
allow, that my conscience repeatedly disturbed me,
and seriously too, with the suggestion that I should
be guilty of direc.t deception, if I said, eith~r that I
was happy in the Convent, or that I had at all times
unshaken faith in any of the declarations I was
.about to mak-e. More than once, too, I was shock·

~ ·~t. the idea of deceiv~ng . my confiding young
{r.end. ·, ·.But as I believed what I had been so often
lalllht. about the virtue.of deception in certain ·cir-
cu~nc:es, I ~id my best to smothe1· my scruples.
.' The .pro~Hd arrangements were made by tho
.Superior;~ the ,old·nuns were instructed not to inter-
rupt .any conversation they might witness between
Miss Ross and myself, and I was directed, at the
appointed hour, to read the lecture. .J. thus easily
found the opportunity I sought, and was soon with
Miss Ross, while·the old nuns appeared very busy
in another part .of the room; and .unobserving.
Though under a repeated promise..to reveal to her
the state of my mind, now that.I had been-long fa.
mi)iar..with the ·secrets of· the nunnery, I most c.an·
tiously guarded .myself, and a~sumed ·what did not
belong to me-the appearance of one devotedly fond
of the institution.
\.
I told her that I had now been long enough a
''Received'' to be able to express an opinion; and I
must inform her that we lived a most happy liftl
within·the institution; that I would urge ·her, as a
friend, to ' take the veil, and withdraw· from that
wor~d · which was so full'of t.emptations. To this
she lent a very serious car; and I saw that my
wo~ds"produced a solemn and saddening effect upon
herJeeliri'gs. She replied that she felt quite undeci·
ded wliat'to do. . She seemed solicitous to be still
farth~r ·as~ured of the happines! I had spoke'n of na

CHAPTER IV.
Stor7 of )llaa ·Ro.sa eontinued-.Plan to cet her Into the Nunnery for
. life-Arran~:emcntli:.....Executlon ofour dealrn.
IT was very easy for me to see that what I said
hnd a great effect on Miss Ross. I found .it impos-
sible, however, to make her promise me to take the
veil. . She persisted ·t!lat she must·&ee her mother
first. · I then left J1er, and ·went to. the Superior's
room; where I informed her of all that had passed.
She appeared very much delighted, and treated me
with great condescension and kindness. She said,
however, that we should yet have to do much; for
it was plain to her that the novice had very strong
scruples to overcome-and she added, th~t the de~··
il's influence was very powerful over some persons.
\Ve must therefore pursue a plan which would re·
qui.re great caution and skill on our part, but which,
she had no doubt, would prove successful. This
she communicated to me in few words. That eveu·
ing the Superior told the nuns that she had been
warned in a dream that some.one was in great temp-
-tations, and desired them to say a Pater and an Avo
for her.
We were to disguise ourselves, and appear to Miss
noss, . I as Satan, and she as the Holy Mother.
Miss Ross must be brought alone, and with solem·
niry, to some place where we could carry through

th~ deception without interruption, and with the best
ef!"~t. The whole of her plan she co~municated
to me ; but as we bad several reheatsale to go
through in preparation, instead of repeating her in..
atructions, I hoo better relate what was done in con-
formity with them. .
When we ~ere prepared to go.through with o~r
p~uts, in order that we might become familiar with
them, she gave me an old robe, which she made me
wrap around me, and the devil1
s cap, head, and
horns,.which is kept to sca:z:e t~e nuns, few of whom
know.of it. ..; T~us. I was con~ealed, eYery thing ex-
cept my eyes, and then approached a spot where we
imagi~ed the novice to ]?~lying. I addressed her
in, a (eig~ed voice, and invited h~t to becg~e mY,
ser~nt, promising her a happy a~d easy life. In
an instant, ·at a moment when we supposed her to be
making the sign of the cross, I'·stopped speaking•.
and hastily withdrew. After a short time, I return~
ed, ond made other propositicns to her j and then,
after flying again from the cross, again came back,.
and promised her, in case she ·would comp~v, to
ensure her marriage with 'the mnn she loved. I
then !etired once more; after which, the Superior-
approached, a~d with as sweet and winning a voice
as she could pssume, said that she had listened to
what had passed, and had come to assure her ofher
protection.
After I had become familiar with my part in t~is
sad farce, and acted it to the satisfaction .nf the Supe-
rior she took measures to have itperformed for the

last time. In this also 1had a principal ~rt to per·.
form j f(jr I'was directed to hold another conversa-
tion \\·ith ·my deceived friend; and, in obedience to
instructions, on Saturdaf evening ~ook h~r into the
.. Examination of Conscience ro"lrn, and inf~r~ed her,
that I had been inspired by the VIrgin Mary to tell
her, that if she would go ·into the nuns' private
chapel, the· Holy Mother would spe~k .with her~
I informed her, however, 'tha~ ifwould not be at aU
surprising if the devil should appear to her, and en·
deavor to prevent her frorri holding so happy an
interview j and that if she' should be .tempted, she
must cross hat-self, and Satan would instRntly leave
her, because he could not withsta~d the ·power
of the.sign. Then telling her that she must keep
a ·strid fast on Sunday evening, I informed ·her,
that' on Monday mo'rnirig I would be with her
aga'iri. '· · : .. · ·
1
In the mean time, the Superior, with the help of
one of the old nuns, sa"'int Marg~rite, and inyself, had
darkened the private chap~l as much as we could,
by m~ans o~ black .C-!:l~tains, and placed only a sin·
g1~. light _
in it, and .that ~taper, butning by the side
of the altai. We 'Rlso' took down the cross, and laid
it ori. ~he· floo;, ~with the hel!-d ~ttrned .to'wards the
door, and the foot towards the altRr. When all was
p~epir~d~ I went to Miss Ross, and· c~nducted her
into the chap~I. _
I told. her to lie down upon the
cro'ss, 'with her arm~ e'xtended, in the attitude of
the crucifie~ Saviour, w·hich she did.; and the~_

outsi~e of whi~h, the ~uperior w~s standing; and
there I was covered w,ith the ol~ robe; for although
it was so dark, the eyes of the poo! girl were blind-
e~, and her head purposely so placed, that she could
h~rdly .hav~ see'n us. un~er any circumstances, yet
the ·Superior said, perhaps she might peep a little
anc:i see us. Ifthis plan failed, she said, she must
resort to some other.
We were both completely disguised; and I
had ·not only the dress O!J, and ·devil's cap, bu~
a •~ice cut from a potato, and slit in different ways.
so as to resemble great teeth, which .was crowd·
cd into my mouth. . The front part of my ~p
ha4 been turned up inside, and I painted my
cheeks ·with some red paint the Superior gave

had not enough: _

quarter of an hour, the Superior'signified that it was
time to .return, and begin my temptation. I there- ' ·

from her:,!lena, repeated some of the words I had:
been taught; and the ~rcumstances ar.e still most

' " Would you·not like to come out of this placer''

Ross made the sign of the cross again, and I van·

the Superior mad~ me'·sit down, and signified that
I must :Dot make the ~lightest noise. She remarked,.
•• Well, if this plan does.not succeed, I will try force."
She then went in and addressed her, in French, in
this manner: · · ·

She then asked hl~r if she was willing to give up
all she had to.the Holy Church, ·and told her~ th~t
unless she would part with"all, she could not accept
her. She then promised her her protection, if she -
.was willing, and retired · saying, "Peace be with
you.''
. . ' .
In the afternoon I was sent to request her to go
into the Superior's room, ·as sh~ wished to speak
with.· her. On E'ntering ·it, we found the Superior
of the Convent and the ·superior of the Seminary
both there. . The former addressed her, telling her
that she had had a vision, in which she was told
that the young novice who .':vas doing penance in
the chapel, was acceptable in the sight of God. At
this, Miss Ross appeared quite overjoyed, but scarce·
ly able to·speak.
The Superior then told her, that she ought to list-
en to any advice I might give her, for she had entire
confiden·ce in me,· and she ought to be guided by my
counsel. She requestt'd her to return to the novices'
department, retire into a corner, and determine \vhat
she would do. She,then whispered to me, and de-
aired ine to remain·with her until the Superior of
the Seminary went away, ·which I did. She then
10 BLACK N1fli'N.ERy ,
told me to go to Miss Ross again, and·coax her to
be received almost immediately. .~.
I :went accordingly,.nnd endeavored to get a prom·

persjsted that she m1J8t see he:.: mother·before she
could take the veil. I inquired of her the reason.

ONE of the nuns was from St. Mark'!!/ Rnd bore
the name of St. Mark. Her father visited the Su-
perjor one day, lind requested her to have the nunri
pray for him daily for a short time, leaving with
her a considerable sum of money to pay for their
intercession. Such things were oceasionaUy d<?n~
by different persons. He also sent nbout_forty dol·
Iars to his daughter, .with a .desjre that they might
be ~istributed among the nuns, to purchase whate\'·
er they might wish for. Th(.' Superior informed' us
thnt it was quit~ inconsistent with the rules for the
nuns to receive such presents,.but that, considering
the devout character of the gh·er, sh'c would not en·
tirely forbid the execution of his request. She there·
fore furnished us with some molas~es to make into
candy, and allowed us an unusual degree of liberty
during a part. of a day. A considerable quantity of
molasses was made into candy by some of the most
skilled in the process : th~ugh by no means as much
as forty dollars' worth. · 'I'hc Superior, however,
had a trick played on her in consequence of the in-
dulgence : for some of -us attributed it tda desire of
pleasing the ric·h contributor, nnd not to any ·kind·

111 fear of the priellta-Arnmtnt8 uled to kllp Ul In IUbjectlon-
Old DUDI. I
I wAI kept in great fear of the priests, by preten·
ces they made to various kinds of power. I was
once confessing to Father J3edar, who is now dead,
and told him I had something on my conscience
which I did not like to communicate. He said to
me," I have power to strike. you.dead this minute;
but I will not. I will spare you. Go arid.examine
your conscience, and aee if you cannot come back
and tell me what it is that you now conceal!'
I was much .i'rightened; for I believed·what he
aaid, and supP91ed he could have taken away my
life on the spot by only wishing it. I therefore im·
mediately went to the examinalion of my conscience
with fear and trembling. '
,I have remarked in my first volume, more than
oace, that we were told it was a duty to submit to
the licentious wishes of the priests. This we were
urged to on various considerations. We were told,
for instance, that bei.ng consecrated to God, we were
not our own, and even our persons were not to be
regarded as at our disposal. Out of considerations
of gratitude, too, we were told, it was our duty to
suppress the doubts and misgivings which would
sometimes arise in our minds, when we allowed our
conacie~ees to present the nature of our life in i..

own proper light. If there were no priests, we were
reminded we couid never get ·to heaven ; and it
would be ungrateful in the extreme, after being in-
sured of eternal life by their kind offices, if we
should deny them any wish whatever.
In spite, however, ~fall that·was said, our feelit~gs
often re_
volted, ·and arguments were renewed.- Not
only so, but now and then, as I have before remark-
ed, penances of different kinds were often resorted
to, to suppress them.
One of the tales told us by the priests, was this-
intended to prove the power they exerciseby means
of sacram_
ents which none but they can administer.
I recollect that it was recounted to us one day at
catechism, by one of the fathers.
" I was once travelling," said he, 16
in a desolate
region, when-1 saw something flying ' like a white
dove. Believing it to be the Holy Spirit,·I followed
it, and it led me..t~ a bouse, over the door of which
it stopped. I went!in, and found 'anold man on his
death.bed, who hnd never been :baptized; nor ever
he:trd of any religion. I baptized himj and he wc~t .
offstraight to heaven."•. ·

One reason why I did not Jike to approach the
cells .occupied by the imprisoned nuns, was this :
the Superior had told me· that they were possef!sed
by evil spirits, and that I must always make the
sign of the'cross on going into the cellar.
Ther¢.:~ seven sins, as we were taught, which
priest~1
canlurt forgive, viz: that of refusing to pay
tythfs to th8~~hurch, injuring dumb animals, setting
a hduse .,.fire, hearing a Protestant preach, rea-
ding Pro~~stant books, and one more which I do
not remember; These, however, can be forgiven by
the Bishop or the Grand Vicar.
From what I heard and observed at different
times, I had reason to believe that a serious mis-
for there were to be eleven loaves mnde, ofdifferent sizes, though
they were all of considerable weight. They were made with a
good INpply of eggs and butter, and took about a bag'ot ftour.
They were ornamented on the top with Peter'a cock crowing,
having on his head a tineel crown, and were ataried over, in n
particular m:.nner, which required great painstaking, and often
cost many triala before they would be done right. My grand-
mother usedto any that it always cost her ten or twelvedollars to
prepare the holy bread ; and the sacrifice of her feelinga appear-
ed to be still more reluc:antly submitted to; for ahe called it, in
her broad Scotch dialect; a service to the Deml.
She was a regular devout attendant on public worship;
notwithstanding her advanced age (above eighty) and the dis-
tance from her church, in Montreal, she seldom or neverfailed
to attend, slthough in consequence of certain unhappy circum-
stances in her family, she could not for some years command
the serVices of the horses in the bnm, and always had to walk•

..understanding existed between the Bish.op and Fa.
ther Ri~hard~. I have heard it hinted, in some way,
t~t the former would probably have had his resi·
dence in 'he nunnery but for the latter. But this I
state only as what I have been told.
The t~rm "old nun," I did not particularly ex·
plain in my first edition. It did not refer entirely
to age. None .of the nuns, indeed, were old women.
For some r~aaon or other, none of them appeared
to me to be above forty years of age, and few more
than thirty. I never knew what made the differ.
enc~ between them and the common veiled nuns,
like myself. It was easy to see that they stood on
a different footing from the rest.of us, but what that
borhood held her memoryin great dislike, and were not allowed
to paaa over any part.of her farni unleaa they had holy water
about them, for fear of being beeet by evil spirits.
.A man1 knew, whose name it ia not neceasary to mention,
the son of a Protestant mother, wished to marry a Catholic
woman, but knew he would be disinherited if he did 10 before
she diapoHd of her property. The priest aUowed them to live
together as man and wife, with the intention to be married nt
a future time. Whep the neiahbora began to talk about them,
the priest gave the woman permission to tum Protestant for a
time, and to be married by a Protestant clergyman, which was
. .
done by Mr. Black. After the death ofher mother-in-law, abe
threw ofF all di~RUiee and avowed her Catholic sentiments.

footing was I never could thoro'og~ly understand.
They had a separate sleeping room, whith I have
described, and exercised much authority, not merely
in overseeing and directing operations in the nuns'
and novices' departments, but were allowed to in-
flict various punishments without consulting the
Superior, and sometimes did punish with great se-
verity.
I ~metimes imagined that there might be some
formal introduction to the dignity and authority of
an Old Nun, and that a higher grade existed, above
that of ~he "'Received." It has occurred to nie as
quite possible, (from what I knew of the difference
between novices and veiled nuns,) that " Old Nuns"
might have taken some peculiar oaths,.and submit-
ted to rules of a special nature. All this, however,
ground, and to secure his crops from insects ! for some of h.s-
neighbors had persuaded him that it bad been cursed in particu-
lar .spots where a Protestant minister bad trodden, when ho
visited it during the life of his mother, so that it was unfit to
produce the priests' blessed grain.
The ceremony of blessing ground and seeds is o•e very
commonly practised in those places in Canada, where l 'hno
been. Before a farmer plants, he takes a handful of seed tohis·
priest, who blesses it, before it is fit to grow; and receives a
sum of money for it, commonly, I believe, as mariy shillings u
there are grains. These are to be mixed with the rest of tho
seed before sowing, and then you are sure of a good crop.-
At aowing time the pnests have often e good deal to do in this
way, and receive much money. The farmers. often pay them
in grain instead of money, whteh ie commonly the beet that is
to be had. I know thatan uncle ofminecommonlyboughthis.
leed wheat at the Seminary, because it was the best"he could
obtain. The priestshave in this way a good deal of trade awl.
Darter to carry on, as is well known in and about MontreaL: ' '· "

82 BLACK NUN~ERY,
I inferred only from their conduct, and the con-
cert and ~nderstanding which they appeared to
have with each .other and the Superior. No fur-
ther light · could I obtain on the subject; and
I am still as much in the dark as ever, although the
Superior once gave me much encouragement to
hope that I should become an "Old Nun."
Some of that class. as I began to say, were far
from being old ; and indeed a number of them were
below thirty years of age,,according to my judg-
~ent. As for their real names, families, or person-
al history, I knew as little of them as others. .We
called them, familiarly, Ma Mere (my mother,) or
Ma Tante, (my aunt,) and commonly obeyed them
without del~¥ when they laid their commands upon
us.
I have no doubt, that, whatever was the process
by which "Old Nuns" are made, the reason of the
elevation ofa " Received" to that dignity, is her su.
perior cunning. It was in consequence of my sue.
cess at imposture, that the Superio! t~ld me she
hoped I mtght become one ; and the old nuns whom
I best knew, were among the greatest adepts at du.
plicity I ever saw.

AMONG the practices in the nunnery, is that of
shaving the hair of the nuns on their admission.-
This.is done to most, but not all; as.the hair of.
some is more easily disposed in a mann~r thought
necessary to the proper arrangement of the head-~
band and veil. My hair was shaved on my recep·
tion; and frequently afterwards. At the time of my

when it has been growing, and it is now about six
inches long. we used sometimes to shave each
others heads, and I have done it for other nuns.
It is a rule, that no novice shall be received who
is not in sound health. Miss Louise Bousquier, of
St. Denis, owe~..her escape from the life ofa nun to
an ·affection of the head, on account of which ·she
was discharged from her noviciate when within ·
nbout three months of the period when she would
have taken the veil.
Sometimes the priests would come to the Superior
to borrow money of her, when she would show lib·
erality towards some, but others I have heard her..
blame for not paying.what they already owed her:
In several instances I knew difficulties to arise from
money affairs.
BLACK NVl'f~BaY.
One day I heard a conversation between the
Bishop and the Superior of the Seminary about a
quantity of plate which an old lady, on her decease,
had bequeathed to the church. The Superior wish-
ed to appropriate it to the expenses of the Semina·
ry, but the Bishop claimed it as his own. He said
he wanted a set of plate, and would have it sent to
his house for his own use. The Superior repli-
ed, that he· could do that as soon as he had paid
the price which he could get for it at the silver
smith's. The Bishop asked him if he knew whom
he was talking to ; and things seemed likely to rise
to some height, when I left the room.
I heard a conversation, soon after my admission
as a nun, · ween the Bishop and the Superior of
the nunnery, in her room. · The Bishop.was com·
plaining that he could not get his proper dues from
the priests: for, as I understood, each priest is re·
quired ·to .pay two English shillings out of every
dollar he receives, for his 'support in the Sem.naryi
while the whole of the profits of every high mass
for the dead, is considered the property of the Sem·
inary. The Superior of the nunnery replied, that
the priests would be better able to pay all their
-debts if they did not gamble I!IO much ; and the state
{)f the country at that time was unfavorable, and lit-
tle n1oney was to be had. The Bishop said he must
. ch a sermon to the people, to make them more
'hal in their contributions.

me in a singular manner. She was conductjng a

priest through the 1ewing room, and had a large
bunch of keys, like on old nun. I could hardly
tell what to think when I looked on her. It seemed
u if I must have seen her before, and yet I could not
remember when or where ; and I bad an imprea·
sion that she could not be a nun. For some rea·
son or other which I could not understand, I felt a
great anxiety to know something about her, and in·
quired of Jane Ray, but she could tell me but little
or nothing. I then nsked leave of the Superior to
speak with Sainte Thomas,--for that I understood
was her name.--
She consented, on condition that
we shQuld converse in her presence. I accordingly
addressed her : but, much to my mortification and
surprise, she replied very coldly, and showed at first
no disposition to interchange more than a salutation
with me. She soon, however, took an opportunity
to write something on a bit of paper with a pencil,
and to slip it into my hand, which I eagerly read
as soon as I could safely do so ; ·and there I found
nn explanation of her conduct. She intimated that
she was unwilling to confide in the Superior, but
wished to see me.alone the fir5ttopportunity. ·
We soon after had a secret interview, for one
night she stole into my bed, and we lay and talked
together. She then appeared quite unreserved, and
perfectly cordia]; and'repeated that she believed the
Superior was only a spy over us. We soon found
that ·we had been acqu'aintances in former.years, and
had been in the'Congregational Nunnery together,
but after her leaving it, I ·bad met her twice in th&
8
· oltreet, anci healld of her from aome one ; her family
·being so wealthy, we had no intercourse in society.
·She was from a place behin~ the mountain, where
·her father, I believe, Will a ·grocer, and a man or
wealth. Slie had an uncle McDonald.
I lenrnt from her the circumstaaces under which
she entered the nunnery ; and they were peculiar.
She had.not paaee4 a nov.
ieiate, but had purchased
her adrJ,lisaion without St1ch preparation,by the pay·
ment ofa .large sum of money, as site had peculiar
reasoas for wishing for it.
My r-estless anxiety wos thus in a degree relieY·
-ed, for I feund that my impressions were right, nnd
thnt St. Thomas was Dot a nun in the common
meaning of the word ; but, on the other hand, I
found I aad been deceived in believing that all :td·
mitted into the Conv.
ent, had to pass through th8
same long trial and training to which I had been
5ubjeot. '
The state of things in the nunnery cannot be ful·
ly understood, without n knowledge of the fact, that
much jealousy .always exists between some of the
nuns, on account .of their preferenees for particular
priests. And yet a priest once told me, that there
was more wrangling done in the Seminary about
nuns; than any thing else.
Saint .
Clotilda died while I was 'there, of a nat·
I death; and I heard one of the other nuns sa.y
•he wu·glad of it, because the had drawn off the
aft"eetions of a priest from her. The priests often

THE priests who are natives of Canada, are gene-
rally v,ery clo~nish in their manners, and of~en quitP.
brutish in their vices. The nuns would sometimes
laugh at seeing a Canadian priest from some coun-
try parish, coming in with a large piece of bread in
his h~nd, eating it as he walked. A large propor-
tion of the priests ar~ foreigners; and a constant
intercourse appears to be kept up with France, as
we often heard of such and such a father just ar-
rived from that ~ountry. .These are decidedly the
wotst class. Most of the wickedness of which I
have any knowledge, I consider as their work. I£
I should repeat.one half the stories of wickedness
I have heard from the mouths of some of the
priests, I .am afraid they would hardly be believed;
and yet. I feel bound, since I have undertaken to
niake disclosures, not to omit them .altogether.
It is not uncommon for priests to recount anec-
dotes of what they have seen and done; and seve-
ral stories which I have heard from some of
them I will briefly repeat.
. A country priest said one day, that he knew n
priest in a parish better off than those of the Sem-
inary, for he had seven nuns all to himself.

was a married woman. One of the daughten,. he

Another said he was once applied to by a mm
for advice, in consequence of suspiciolla ~ bad of
his wife, and quieted his suspicions by telling him
a falsehood, when he knew the husband was aot
jealous without cause, he himself having been her
seducer.
It may, it must offend the ear of the :rnf><lest tcJ
hear sueh exposures as these, even if made in the

But I am compelled to declare, that this is not all.
I shall stop here, but lest my readers should infer
that it is because there is nothing more that could
be said, I must first make the solemn deelnratioD.
that there are crimes con,mitted in the Hotel Die•
Nunnery too abominable to mention.
I remember a variety af stories relating to eon·
fession, which I have heard told in the nunnery
by priests; who sometimes become very comma·
nicative when intoxicated. One ·or their favorite
topics is ConfeS1>ion. One o.f them showed a
watch, one day, which he said was worth a hun-
dred dollars. He had received it at confession, from
a fellow who had stolen it, telling him that he
must see it safely restored to the owner, while his
intention was to get it into his possession to keep,
which he did, and boasted of what he had done.
I have known priests to sit and talk about what

tDey Jaad done .in the Confessional, for three or four
hours at .a time; and I have heard one give an·
'other instructions how he might proceed, and what
he might do. One priest, I know, paid another fifty
dollars, to tell him what ~as confessed to him by
a yo.uJlg ~ow~ _fox- whom he had a parHality, or
what he eall~d lo-ve. Some~imes one will request
another to aend a particular l~dy .~o confess to him,
either on accoWlt 9( her b~auty or her property :
for considerable sums are in sueh cases obtained
from the rich.
In the country the common practice.is, so far us
I know, to fix the price. of Confession for the year,
nt so~e pal'ticular. rate : as two bushels of wheat
out of twelve; c:r if the pe:rson i3 not a farmer, a.

You confess such a young lady, mentioning her
name. She does not like you, I understand, be·

I knew a country priest, on a wager, drink a
shoe-full of ;wine. I was once near the priests'
p~rlor, (~s ~ have called it,) when I heard two of
them in an altercation, about the speed of two in-
sects; ,which led to a wager, on the question whether
that. insect would move quicker over a hot brick

.exp!lriment. This scene caused great excitement
and loud talking. I have mentioned it to give an
idea of. the manner in which much time passes in
the nunnery.
·One day when I was employed in the hospital,
Aunt Susan came in, one of the old nuns, who had
'
been absent for several days,. and just returned. The
circumstances which I am about to relate were
. .
brought to my mind the other day, by reading in·
Rommond's book about the priests in-Cuba taking
her into a monastery in disguise.
Aunt Susan was something like Aunt Margaret,
in having somet~ingthe matter with her feet which
made her rather lame. I noticed something strange
in·.her·appearance when she came into the hospital,
and found that she was unable to apply the cup in
eupping a patient for whom that lellledy had been
prescribed, although she had been remarkably skil·
ful before, and now appeared to try her best. I
thought she must have taken too much wine, and
undertook to perform the operation at her request,
whieh pleased her so well, that she sat down and
became very talkative, in a manner little consistent
with the rules and practices of the institution.
She told me that she had just returned from Que·
bee, whither she had gone some days before from
our Convent, on a visit to the Hotel Dieu Nunnery
of that city. She had gone iu the dress of a priest,
in company with some father, and had an opportu-
nity to witness the arrangements·and habits of that
· 'tutioa. he went on to make remark,! on dif.
92 BLACK KlYNK.£1lY•
ferent tubjects which had come under her observa..
tion, while I was employed in operating on the pa-
tient. She repreaented the rules in the nunnery
which she had visited as less strict, or less strictly
regarded, than our own; and mid there was mach
less order, peace, and quietnesz, than we enjoy. The
Superior, she said, had less command over thenuns,
and they were less O!derly, and not so well content-
ed. She had a cousin there, as she infOrmed me,
a ·Mia Durauqeau, who was very ·stubborn, and
unmanagea.ble. If ahe were Superior, she ·decla-
red she would half murder her for her rebellious
conduct.
All that I knew about the story told by Aunt Su-
a.n, wu what ehc told me. I did not see her in the
dren of a priest, but I had reason to believe that
the nuDI often left the Convent in such a disguise,
and that this part of her tale was by no means in·
•credible. Indeed, during my stay in the Hotel
Dieu, I personally knew more than one caseof the
kind.
There was an old nun, notoriou1 in Montreal,
known by the name of Sister Turcot, her family
name. I waa one day employed in the .hospital,
when I aaw her enter dressed like a priest, in com-
pany '"ith one or two fathers. She spent a few
·minutes there, during which she went up to one o(
the patients' beds, and performed prayers instead of
one, and with IUch address that I should never have
1Uapect~ any thing irregular, I think, if I had not
kllown her appearance as well as I did. It was with

~e greatest difficulty that I refrained from laugh..
ing at a sight so ludicrous. She was at the time on
her way out of the nunnery, .in company with the
priests, and after a·short delay left the hospital, and
went, as I supposed, into the street.
,J.3ut I had still stronger evidence than this, of the
departure of nuns in open daylight•.in the dress of
priests; for I was repeatedly called in to help them
put on their disguise. I havedressed the nun Sainte
Felix, thr.ee or four times ; and a hateful creature
she was, in consequence .of her jealous disposition.
She was always thinking some one else a greater
favorite than herself, with some priest.
ThP. place where the change of dress was usu-
1\lly made was the Superior's room ; ' and in the clos-
P.t in the adjoining passage, at the end neorest her
door, were always kept a number of priests' dresses,
nearly a shelf full; as well as several black-hood-
ed cloaks, like those worn by the Sisters -~· o(
Charity. ,
A priest once told me, that he bad three nuns to
take out of the Co11vent that day, and was troubled
to know how to do it. He had often taken out one
at a time, and had sometimes thought he might lose
them if they were disposed to run away. He com-
monly directed them to limp as they passed along
the streets;-" for,'' said he, "many of the priests
do so, and they might pass very well for limping
priests ; and in.
.onr dress, how can you tell a man
from a woman 1 But," he added, "now I have got
three ; 1

out together, tho devils of women might atart off

he Superior one day informed me, that I was
to pay a visit to the Bishop on thQ evening of the
next day. The intelligence surprised me; and, as
no further information was given me, I did not
know exactly what to think of it. The period
o( which I speak might have been about a year
after I took the veil.
On the evening appointed, I wns taken to the
Superior's room, ,nnd furnished with a priest'•
dress, which, in compliance with her directions, I
put on. Father Phelan, who was present, thea
conducted me out of the Nunnery soon nfter dusk,
according t<> my recollection. We pnssed down
towards my mother's house, ncro~s Notre Dame
st!eet, and round Citadel Hill, till we reached a
house which I had never before known for the
Bishop's, and stopped nt the t!oor. No house ad·
joined it on my right. ':Ve rang; and the dooT
was opened by the Bishop himself, which greatly

peel and sat down. Supper was soon-ready, which
wa1 a rich one.
The room in which I was. was that in which I
remained during my stay, and the only one in tho
house which I ever entered. . It had windows lo~k·
ing upon the street, but in the rear the remaining
part of that story appeared to be taken up with
dark cupboards, which I afterwards found contain·
ed clothes and other articles, in considerable. num-
bers. There was a large staff, which the bishop
said was of solid gold, and cost seven or eight
thousand dollars.
After Father Phelan had gone away, the Bishop
invited me to play cards, which we· did on that
and other evenings; commonly the gnme called
"catch the ten." The Bishop's table was set with
o. complete service of plate, marked with two let·
ters, one was L. I spent a part of almost every
day in a small apartment or closet in one corner
of the room : for as there were commonly fre·
quent calls on the Bishop, whcn.persons were ad·
mitted to that room, he chose to see them alone.
The custom was:·when any person called, for the
servant to·give notice to him· by ringing a bell;
and if he wished to have him brought up stairs,
he would ring one in reply; but if not, he took no
notice, of it. There was a supply of,.excellent
wines and confectionary, in a closet in·the large .
room, which was always open.
During a part of my stay, I was employed in
cleaning nnd putting in order the Bishop's money.

.which he kept in an iron chest in th-6 closet I have
mentioned. He told me that the silver and .gold
very soon became tarnished by lying there~ and
that he found it necessary to have it cleaned once
a year. I should judge that he had ordered a nun
to.be sent from the Convent, partly to perform this
task. He said that sometimes, wh.
en he had a
.large sum of money to pay for land, he. bad .felt
quite ashamed to give only tamished silver and gold.
I worked for hours at rubbing the coin, with
chamois cloth,.to make it bright, and had to ar-
l'ange it all with care upon a table, before put·
ting it away in the chest. The silver was prin-
cipally ~alf dollars, which the I bishop told me
to place in piles of six. The gold was ·kept in a
~eautiful little ~ox, and was quite tarnished, so'that
h~ made.me wipe it ~ver and over several times,
b~fore he was satis.
fied with its appearance.
..~esides these, he had a large amount of money
·.in bank bills, princ~pally of five dollars. These
'he,made me S!UOOt~ out carefully with' a ho~· iron.

me, although he was sometime3 there seven or
eight·times a day. Father Phelan nlso came of·
ten; but generally during the bishop's nbscnce,
who rode out every day.' 'Vhenever the bishop
went out he locked the .door and took away the
key ; but when Father Phelan came in his ab·
sence, he opened it with a key of his own, ns I
.suppose unknown to the bishop. He repeatedly
inquired of me what the bishop had sa1d about
him ; and seemed very anxious to ascertain whcth·
er he stood high in·his estimation or not. Father
Tombeau or Tabeau, also had a key,· and some·
times used .it, but, I believe, with the bishcp's
knowledge, although he never happened to sea
me there.
The partition of the little room, or closet, was
ao thin, that I could distinctly hear conversation
held in a considerable part or the great room.
Tombeau came in one day and said to the bishop,
I have had a goodday at confession, (with something
like an oath,) throwing down a quantity of money
\lll the table. . The bishop replied, that so it ap-
peared, and gathe'red it up: On another ··occasion
he'came in at evening, and said, " Well, I ~m go·
ing to the nunnery to~night ;" to ·which the bishop
replied-" Very well, I have nothing for you to

eall; and Mr. Sullivan, a gentleman of MoRtreal,
whom I had often seen from a child. He remain·
ed a considerable time after the others were gene,
and then I had to listen to the most vile convet:sa,.
tion that I ever heard.
Persons came in at different times to confess ;
but as the bishop seated himself at the other end
of th .ro01:p, I ~eard little or nothing of what they
said. One day a woman came in who called her-
self Mrs. Green, of Montreal, and made a long
complaint against her husband for ill-treating her.
I gc,t a sight of her face thr~ugh the keyhole,
and found her quite handsome. ' .his wor:nan had
a dog with her, which caused some annoyance by
barkmg. She afterwards called several times ;
and once, I think it was on her third visit, was ac-
companied by another woman, whose voice I
thought I recognised as soon as I heard it. After
a little time I ascertained to a certainty that I was
not mistaken; but the discovery was one of the
most painful I ever made. She confirmed the a~:
count the woman had given of the conduct of her
husband, and afterwards conversed with the 'bishop
· on other subjects; for she remained there probably
not less than an hour and a half. The bishop

House.
· ·The reply whicJJ, the bishop final~y gave to Mrs.
Green was, that she need not live with her hus·
band, but that she must confess to him daily. He
afterwards told me he·would not' have had me 'seen
by one· of ·those visiters for any thing in the
world. . · · ' · : • ·
Soon after I came to the bishop's, I found that
he was finis~ing the compo~ition of a hymn,·which
he was making, to be 'sung to a war song, begin·
ning with these words:
11

He had.the pap~r~ .by h.i~ ,on which, he. was
~riting it, ~nd would often sing a part ·of' it over
and over. ·. I will give from memory .a verse or
two, of the seven· or eight of which it consisted.
and most of which I mig~t recaU, as I have since

A .a'EoAnD to truth requires.that I sho.
11ld not
charge other persons with assuming the office of a
priest, \Vithout admitting that I h.ave done so myself,
if my testimony is necessary to convince my rend~
ers that such things are ever done. ·
Early,.one morning, Father Bonin told me that
he was quite indjsposed, and felt unable to perform
the task of confessor in the chureh, which devolv-
ed upon him, rind he thought I might talcehis place,
and go through the ceremony without being dis-
covered. 1'he priests have often expressed in my
hearing a dislike of sitting for hours in the confes-
sional box, as a dull and wearisome task ; but Bo-
nin appearedat that time to be somewhat indisposed,
and offered to tell the Superior if she asked form~.
~ did no~ rria,ce any serious opposition to his propo·
eal; and he went on to give me instructions how to
.prpceed. ·
/ · l:le told J!lC that I must first put on his clothes
&}ld gown, and cover my head with his hat, and then
proceed to the church through the subterranean
passages, enter the first confessional box by the chap·
el of Saint Magdalen, near the high altar, with all
the familiarity l could assume, take my seat1put on
a little cap which I should find there, cover my face
with his handkerchief which he gave me, and pro·

c:eed as I should think proper with such persons as ·
should present themselves, remembering to speak
in· a feigned voice. Particular instructions were :
necessaryto enable me.to find my way tothe eb~rcb;'
nnd he told me ·first to go through the subterranean
passage lending ·into the cellar' of the Congrega·
tionnl Nu.nnery, then turning a corner a few ·~eps
distant from the door, descend into another and fol·
low it to the end. There I should find a light trap·
door, · which ·I could raise with my bend. This
would admit me into the ·sacristy of the·-church,
from which to my station the passage was direct.
After receiving such instructions'in hnste, though
at gre~ter length thnn I have ·gh•en them here, nnd
having dressed myself in his clothes, I set out on
my errand; but the garments were so much too
l1-rge for.me, that I found ·some difficulty in pro.: ·
cerding. I went down into the nunnery cellar; pro-:. ·
ce.eded to the. farther end ·of it; opened the low do~r
to the subterranean pnssag~ I \Vas flrst to·enter, and··
soon reached its extremity.~ Following.mJ.. dir~~-·
tions, though still in almost total darkness, I gr~~
ed my' way 'round n comer of a ·stone wall;- 8n .,.
found a staircase~ (I think of elev~n steps,) do ·:.
which I cautiously pro'ceeded, then, by putting ~p ,
both hands, so as to'·touch both sides of the passage·
to which they led me, I found my way along with· ·
out inuch difficulty, except what aroie froin the size:·

t~p-door of which I had been illformed. Preuing hea
~ - head against it a little, it easily rose,. and I en· wis.
tered an apartment above groUDd. ed·a
· ·At .the time when I lett the· Hotel· Dieu,·it was A
scarcely daybreak,. but the light was now so much min1
stronger, that I oould distinguish objects with dear· then
ness; and, proceedillg a~ onee towards the high al- worJ
tar, and the chapel of,Sai11t Magdalen, 1 made for and j
the first confessional box. ·.· There I saw a number thin~
of. persons of different descriptions, kneeling, on entir1
both sides of the box, engaged in preparing fc,r a lo-w
confession ; but I walked with as firm a step~ 'and :· " 1\
an ai~ of as much unconcern as I could, kneeled Th
before the altar, aad said ·(or appeared to ~y) a

so that.a trembling came over me. I leaned my
head upon my hand, and for a few instants heartily
wished myself out ~f a .place which I still regard·
ed·as sacred.' · · ... ··
All these thought~, however, passed through my
mirid much more rapidly ·than I: have described'
them. I had hardly time-to sit down by the lattice
work, cast a glance through it about the church,
and retlect, that-although a.confessor can see-
every
thing from his box.-·he is himself in the dark, and·
entirely·eon~ealed fro~ all inspection, wlien I heard.
a low and moumful·voice .murmuring in my ear-
:• "Mon p~re, benissez moi, parce que j'ai peche."
. These words, with which confession commences,
came from an·old man, who had-earliest taken his
place by the confessional box in·the morning, and·
w·ho, according to·ge~eral custom, ·was entitled: to' ·
the:first hearing. '· I let him run on with his) ltory-
withottt interruption, and was glad that he made•it.
long; as I dreaded to ~rust myself..to speak. H~
said; ·"I ·have-performed the penance which.you ·
laid upon me, arid I ·have sinned but once since my
last confession, when I 'got into a ~sion ~with my
wife. But·you ought to·know what kind ofa e~ea­
ture she is, and how-impossible i(·is t~ get alon~.
with her·in·peace.'~ He at length brought his tale
to Bl'l enc:l, and then, to my -surprise, asked·me'foi
absolution. ··Up to this time I had not ·opened my.
lipi; and did not'like to trust ·my voice,(even in the.
lowest tone ; 'but the thought of being called on to ·
beetow abeolution~ ignorant at .I was of 'the.Latin'

away ; while a yoang lad who had been long wait~

to··tell the particulars of the circumstances attend·

but I insisted that he could uot be let oKfrom such
an act of self-denial
,., After this boy had gone ·away, a womancame up
:and held up to me a.handful of silver, saying ·she
had told a great many lies to her mistress, (she was
'8. servant in a house in the city,) and had brought me
three dollars, mostly in British shillings,lo pay.for
·high·mass, which, she sa.id,.she'thougbt would pro-
-cure her forgiveness for the whole. .She handed ·
the money to me, a~ul - I took· it,'·telling her hu
wish. shouli :be granted.
A young country girl afterwards presented her·

to find ·out who1:Jt she was ,to marry; and the feaT t
she had that the Devil had appeared to her. · She ·

she thought perhaps:

told ker she·had 'been guilty
of sacrilege, in having any thing .to do with sueh

..
108 BLAUJt JrUJIJII&IlY.
that this ease wu rather a difficult one, and I muat
.eommunicate with the Bishop before I could give
~answer.
After this a woman took her place at the lattice,
ODd began a confession of.a nature not proper to be
repeated, disclosing a character.which disgusted me
extremely. I was obliged to listen in silence, for
I could not invent .any way to interrupt her; but
was glad when she had done. I do not recollect
· the order in which all appeared whom I confessed
that morning, and shall not attempt·to give it; nei-
ther can I fix with absolute certainty the exact
·number.
One man told me he had come for absolution for
the sin of drunkenness, which he had recently com.
mitted~ I told him to get drunk again· daily, and
return at the end of the week, and he should pe ab-
solved·from all together; for -1 thought from what
I had seen in the Convent-that drunkenness was its
.own best .punishment.
A girl brought me a··parcel of money which she
had stolen from her mistress, requesting me to re·
· ~ore it to her,..and informing me that .her.mistre~'
name would be found in the.parcel. rhis I took,
and on her asking. rile to l bestow absolution upon
her, I told her to do an act ofcontrition; and ventured
·to·say something.over in a low voi~e ~hich she
eoul~ not distinctly hear, and making· the:sign o(
the cr()ss with my hand, I sent her off;well satisfied
that she was pardoned. .. . .

priests, and o. public trial took p~o.ce, which result·
eel in their favor, it being decided that the marriage
was not legal, having been performed only by a
magistrate; and the poor nian was obliged~ pay
several hu~dred dollars to the priests. I 'heard
expres~ons mad~ by SQme of them on receiving the
money: They aid they would have no objection
to having· several of.the · nuns t:un away, if they
could get as well paid for it. ,- ~.
.. Some yeais ago there.was.- a priest who was put
into the madhouse. . I was not acquainted with the
reason at the time, but I have since learned fro~ a
youQg.woiJWl :who was in the Congregational N~n·
ery abo.ut the period.when it happened, that Ia~ ran
away whh one of: the Congregational nuns. .He
~~ taken a few miles from Mon~real and brought
baek; and, for fear he would expose ·the dreadful
deeds done there, they put him into the madhouse,
and he is there, I believe, to this day.

I RAJ) an acquaintance with Father T. a. Me·
Mahon before'I mefwith him in the nunnery. He
used oecasionalJy to ·call·· at ·the Government
Hoose. When the:Governor visited .Montreal, the
priests sometimes wished to hold an interview with
him in·private;·after the public reception of citizens
was concluded. 'McM~hon once applied to my
mother,'in ~orne way to procure him·an -interview ;
and as.it was obtained, he expreased·mucli pleasure,
and SOUle 'gratitude to her. They commonly were
anxious to get' a sight'of the rolls of officers, when
u· new ·Cletachment' ·Of troops ·arrived from Eng·
Iimd; and'· this· could ·-be ·done by making favor
with .some one who could admit them .into the
Government House,:where they .were ·accessible.·
The cause, as I understood it, was this : No Ro·
man Catholic is allowed to hold an office in the
British army; but those who renounce that reH-
gion are admitted. Such as have renounced it are
marked·in some way on the lists; and those names
the priests used to get and copy off, that they might
afterwards visit the officers, and get them to attend
their church. Fro~ what I saw and ·heard, I
judged that the priests supposed that ·many of them
had renounced only that they might become of·

though he was held in such repute (or sanctity, by
many of the ignorant Canadians, t~at they would
'say he waa holding.coi)Uilunion wit_

calling.him the persecuted Mc~ahoii.
After my entrance .into the V.eiled Department,
I often.saw .McMahon's character displayed, under

hjmself. fast asleep, and t~en ~as o.~com.modated
with a bed until he was able to walk. When he
. ' I • \
was ~ick~ t~(), and resorte4 to the "l:loly Retr~at,"
he,w~ allowed as muc~ ind~lgen.ce ~s, any of th~
priests. This was the case at :a pe~iod when he

one day directed by the Superior to go with im·

10fa in her room. We obeyed her orderl, although
the tuk was a degrading one, under tho circum·

this was not a solitary instance 'of a similar kind :

himself, from nobody knew who. ·The ·noise<and
confusion were dreadful. The nuns present were
all frightened, but could do nothing, and the Supe·
rior of the Convent stood by wringing her hands,
and crying bitterly. When the battle was over,
one of the' nuns was sent to Father Bonin, to dress
a wound he had received, but was too much agita·
ted to ao it, and I took her place. The old man
had a long and deep cut near the temple, and.bled
very freely. He said he had fallen upon a piece
of glass and cut it, but told me he had long wanted
to give the bishop one g~od knock, ~~--had taken
adv~ntage of the confusion to strike· him in the
face.
I found afterwards that his story was very likely
to be true ; for the bishop had a good large bruise
near his eye, which he did not like to have seen,
and in consequence spent the remainder of the day
in the nunnery. After sunset his calache was sent
for, in which he took his departure for home.
Some of the most ala'rming scenes I ever knew,
-were the fights which now and then took place in
the nuns' dortoit at night, between priests. One

if .uy, it would be proper to withhold~ Before I
could form any satisfactory plan on this subject, it
ieemed neceaaary to fix upon some gener~l princi-

I decided upon the following:
, In th~ first place-although·some things which
I had to communicate :were of such a nature as
ought not to· be mentioned ·without solid reason;
yet, such was the important object to be gained by
their avowal; an~ the necessity. of having. them

reluctance I naturally felt to present myself volun-
tarily· as a participator in dreadful and shocking
scenes, I still might que~tion; whether by narra-
ting them, even \Vitb the most ecrupulaus caution,
I might not propogat~ something of the very evil
of \vhich I had to,.cot:nplain. But I was·among a
people who had no suspicion' of the existence of
enormities with ·which I had been fa~iliar ; ~nd
there \Vas ·nobody bot myself' able to open their
eyes. It seemed to me to be important to the peo- .
ple·of the United States,"that they should know
the characters of the priests nnd nuns of Montreal;
u I had seen undeniable evidence of their being
connected with others ·in this country, ~nd hovin'g
considerable influence with them: "If allowed to
go·on, who could·tell how far they might succeed
in bringhtg things to such acondition as' thev 'are
in Canada~ I therefore determined to 'run th~ risk
of puiting'*e modest ·io the blush, ·by the 'disclo-
sure Qf truths mecessnry to be known for the safety'of
astate 6f society'which I had ah-eady seen enoug~-· :·;~

arid love. In making such dfsclosures,
however, I·d:etermined·to use the most guarded laii':.
gunge, nnd·.~s mur.h brevity as could be made con-
aist~nt \Vith a elear exposure of what eee'med.most
neces'sary to be known. .
In the second place, there was a considerablll

._, ~ . .
I KAY perhap1 have excited the curiosity ofsome l
of. the readers of my first volume by my allusion tc
to·my three vows, and-yet withholding them. I r~
~ould .not make up my mind at that time to mention Bj
them ; and now, after much consideration, I have to
hardly k~own· ~hether I ought to give them to the fa
·Apierican public, or to,pass them over in sil~nce. ti•
I have ascertained, however, since I have convers- th
ed with so many persons ofdifferent charQcters and l)e
stations in this city, that very little .knowlt}dge ex- pr
ists in relation to Convents, and the character of foi
our Canadian priests and nuns, which, it seems to
me, ought to be bettc,r understood. Besides, I have
undertaken in this volume to disclose things not
mentioned in my former one, which are intimately
connected with the purport of those vows, and in·
deed quite dependent upon them.
In doing this, which I have deliberately conclu-
ded to be a part of the solemn duty I owe to the
world, it must be recuD -~ted by those who might
be most disposed to blame me, that the fault is
chargeable, not upon her who proclaims the evil,
but upon those who commit and conceal it.
The import of the First Vow was this :-that all
officers and citizens admitted into the nunnery in
priests' dresses were to be obeyed in all things.

The Stcond Vow was-that there are thing• in
the Island; which, 'if I lfnow, I will not disclose.
These two vows, and a third one, led to the com·
mission qf many crimes. ·
Soine time after I was .received, to my great
amazement, after 'we had retired to our sleep~,ng
room one ~ight, a. man in'the dress of a pr'iest spoke
to me, whom I' recognised to be a gentleman, who
resided but a f~w streets from my mother'e.~I
spoke to him, 'and asked him if it was not he; 'I
told.him it was of no use to attempt to deceive me,
for I kne~v him. ' He requested me never to men-
t~op. that I had seen him there ; and ~nformed ' me
that he lu1d given five hundred dollars to the Semi·
l)ary for permission to come in under th~ garb of a
priest~ through the subterranean passage. ·ae in-
formed me that many British officers were admit·
ted in the same manner.
~ot many weeks aftermy receptibn,nn old priest,
Bresseau, came iiito th'e nun~ery one day; and not..
long afterwards,·in the priests' sitting-room I found
h~m in a state of intoxication. He began by say~
ipg how lit~le he cared for the bishop, and then
spoke on a subject which 'eemed1t~ .be uppermost
with him-a controversy whic.h existed between the
bishQp and hims~l£ Without any encour~gement
!o~- my part, beyond that of being alistener, \vhi~h

tioned him. to interfere in hia beh • In thlt be
wu succesaful ; and he waa suffered to reta his
place. The bishop, of course, could not , t be
displeased at such an interference; and the ~irci.tm·
atances of the ease Bresseau either knew, or pre·
sumed to be e~tensively k~own among the clergy.
In time he aucceeded in the object he had so
much at heart; for he accumulated money, and
by, 1ome m.eans got' enough to purcha1e three or
four farms, \vhich, or the incomes of which, he
secured for the support of his children. He then
determined to hold out in his opposition to the bish·
op rio longer, feeling ·rather conscience-smitten at
the thought that he had set his authority at defiance.
He did not wish to remain in the positi9n ol a.
determined opponent of him, and decided to pr't
eced to Moritrea], and have the matter properly ar-
ranged, so that he might again enter into·a good ~
understanding imd connexion .with the Seminary.
He added that he had recently arrived in the city,
and·was·expecting the bishop's return, who was then
absent.on one of his tours of visitation, and expected
to return before inany days. It appeared that he'
had found no impediment to his entrance into the
Seminary, and he cenainly was received wiih free·
dom in the nurmery, 1\S he had been indulging in a
too free use of wine when I saw him. ·

story corroborated by remarks which fell from sev-
eral ~ther priests in conversation, particularly_

At l~ngth, however, .she appeared to rel~nt, and

deavoring to stanch the blood with.a·to\vel, and a

It would be worse for his soul, as he would suffer

The Superior listened.to the reproof of the bishop

herself entirely. " We are all apt to err:'1 she

Jlfun•' llland:-What I heard ,r It In my Chlldbood-Tba dift'erent
lllanda 10 called-Prleat L'Eaperance7 1\ly visit to Nu~s' lslifd.
JANE RAY, in a conversation she once had with
me~ told me that:she had been at Nuns1
Island, and
mentioned strange things in relation to it, which
made a considerable·impression on niy mind~ · Of
the'place to .which she referred, I had before a lit-
tle knowledge, as much, I suppose, ·as .is pos·se·
ssed
by most people in Montreal; and the vicinity. I
knew that there ·were several islands 1in ·the'St.
Lawrence called l',luns' Islrinds,1of-whieh the three
principal ones have large buildings upon them.
Some of these must have been noticed by alll_lost
every person visiting Montreal, particularly the
one nearest that city, which belongs to the Gray
Nuns, and is in full view from Laprairie,· and the
ferry. Many travellers from the United States
must also have noticed the Black Nuns' Island
near Lachine, several miles up the river. I had
often seen it when visiting my uncle, who lives
near that town ; and had heard reports ancl suspi-
cions concerning it.
A considerable part of it is shut in by a high
stone wall, which encloses three large buildings of
the same material; but I never had been wi~h any
person who gave me any • . of'~~ from
personal knowledge, as all access to it -~~d~ to

the priests, and those permitted by them. My
'U~c'le sometimes sold cattle •o persons employed.to
]lUrchase for ·the island, but never visited the place.
-
Some ·of the 11eighbors, -
pa:rtieularly old country
·people, 'I have heard call the place " The Priests'
Wives' Island." I ·sometimes used to look towards
it with-some ·curiosity; but even from my uncle's
garret window, little of the buildings was discern·
·ible except the chimneys, according to my rec.olleo-
·tion, 'the view of them being intercepted, I think,
-by some high land on the great island; the othei
Nuns' Island8, as I might :have mentioned before,
~eing ·called " Les petits i-sles''-~he small islands.
'Thus 'it was that I 'knew litde about the subject on
·which Jane Ray spoke, on··the occasion above al-
1uded to·; but v;hat she .said, although spoken with
•
reserve, an'd an air ofmystery, hripressed me ,vlth
'the conviction 'that the island was the scene of
:strange things.
. ...J .•
I must a:Jso'stophere a momentto remark,tha't this
..Was not ·the firSt: intimation 1 had in relation to that
1J>lace, 'though what ''I had before received 'was ve'l-{
indistinct. It was conveyed to ·me in one of the
"three oaths, which I was required to take immedi~
.&tely on' my taking·the Black Veil, as ·the reader
·wili find :in my,first volume.• 'Those··oaihs I felt
much unwillingness to communi-
cate iti that book,
'i»eciuise 'they bound us to perform thing! !of a re~

with disclosures which I thought best to reserve
for the time. In one of thosp oaths I had ·made a
most solpmn promise to do every thing, that might
be required of ~u at Nuns' Island, and· never to
speak in the ,. nunnery of things which I might
witness there. This was accompanied with the
most dreadful imprecations on myseif, in caSf! I
should violate the oath : as that I .might be sunk
to the lowest place in,heU, have the worst of devil:'!
for my tormentors, and never ,see the face of the
Savior. No information was given me, however,
from which I .might form any idea of the condition
of Nuns' lsland, or the scenes transacted there. I
oould only form an unfavorable idea of the place.
I may stop here a m~ment, to speak of the
Priests' Farm. The Pr~ests' -Farm is a p~cce ot
ground not . far from ~ontreal, of which I repeat·
~dly heard mention made while I wa.s in the nun-
nery. Father Phelan .told me most of what I then
heard. said about it. No person, as I understood,.
is ever admitted there 'Yithout permission from the
Seminary. ·. Prie~ts, under p~n3:nce?. for .ofltmces

some old nuns are constantly kept. there, and t4at
otht~rs 'a·re frequently taken to an(l from the:re and.
the nunnery, but' always in priests' dJ:esses.

nl.e also that the priests are sometimes punished
there, \Yho have offended their superiors, by means
of'"n cap, which is drawn over their head and face,
and destroys life almost at once. From what he
said, I should judge that the cap might be in some
respects like that I have worn in the Nunnery,
and that it was ft:cquently used. If those in au-
thority are disobeyed in any m~nner, he said, the
offender is sure to be punished at the Priests' Farm.
There was a young priest, named L'Esperance,
very igno1·ant and disugree3ble, whom I saw a few
months after I took the. veil. I nad confessed to
him when in the Congregational Nunnery. He
came to the Black Nunnery several times, and I
had several conversations with him on different sub-
jects, particularly one Sunday; when he wished
me to stan~ by and see that he was not cheated at·
cards. But one day he made a proposition to me,
which I ·thought I ought to communicate to the
Superior. ' He informcfl me that he was going to
the United States as a missionary, and invited me
to go with him, as a teacher, and privat~ly "live
ks his wife. · He said that he Bishop would
doubtless permit me to leave ~~'e Convent in secret,
and we should never be known. I made little re-
ply to this proposal; but took an early opportunity,
when·I found the Superior iii her ro'om alone, .to
acquaint her'with it. It was one day while I was
fixing a dress for her. She ·expressed· great ·dis-.
plea8ure, ·and .evidently appeared to regard th~ · ·
subject very serious}y.
·'
148 DLACK N.t1NNUY•. ·
I soon after found that she had informed Father-.
Phelan, for he spoke of the proposal, and' said,.
"Je lui donnerais un coap qu'il ne faut pas un.
second." [I will give him a dose, (that is, either·
a blow or a drink,)1that shall be the last.] From.
this.time the Superi9r,and others began to talk to.
mo of paying a visit to Nuns' Island. .She some-
times said it would be good· for my health, as l
needed air an£1 exe~cise ; bu~ 1 found that both she·
and Father Phelan, had a pa~ticular wish that 1
s4ould: go; and I was disposed' to ·obey them, as- I
considered it my duty. I found that the Su.per.iOr
, appeared, to L'Esp~rance, to.. give in .and' be his.
friend. Something I now understand, which I
could not as well penetrate at that time: I have
119 doubt of the meaning of the expression of Fa~­
ther Phelan, which I have givea above,. although.
i~s meaning is of itself rather equivocal.
At length the time was fixe.
d for .my visit to the
Island~ and I was to go in.company with L'Espe-
rapce, at a late hour of the night, and in disguise.:
to ~void discovery. At the time appointed, I was
t~ken into:the Superior's room, had a black cloak
thr()wn over me, (sach as are worn by the "SiSters.
of .Charity/., ia the·streets of New York,) and the·
4ood pulled over my head. TWs was taken from
a c~pboard near the- Stipetio.r's room, where a sup-
ply ·is always kept. We thea left the Convent

we got.
We took our · seats in the carriage, and the
coachman drove to the Seminary, where he stop-
ped, and my companion alighted, rang a bell, and
was admitted by the yardman, who then came out
and addressed a few words to me, and remarked
that it was a raw night, and .rather late to cross.
I am unable to speak with certainty of the season,
but I think it must have been early 'in autumn.

peared to have been sitting up till that late hour,
on purpose to await us. Here I took a seat and
sat for some time. The old nuns brought me some
refreshments, of which I partook ; and then one
of them led me to a chamber near the end of the
building, in which were tw:o or three very wide
beds, at least .one of which was occupied by
women. Into one of the others I soon got, at the
proposition ~f ~y attendant, and she threw herself
.. down upon one of the others, near me, and enter-
ed into some conversation, with much appearance
of kindness, ·in which she mentioned that informa-
tion had been sent frc;>m the nunnery, that our
party would arrive at the islandthat night, and that
the gardener, as well as themselves, had_been duly
notified of it.
In the mor.ning I found.that I was .at liberty to
go \vhere I pleased, without leaving the walls, ns
no cer~mon~es were to be ·performed, or prayers
said, as hi the nunnery. I was under nc;> obliga-
tion to ·rise at any particular time, there was no.
fixed' hour for breakfast, no processions were to be
form·ed, no time of sile~ce to be observed, and,
which wa~ still better, no penances were to be ap-
prehended. I took .advantage of the freedom al-
lowed me, to make some obse.rvations on things
ar~~nd me. The following description embraces
th~ngs which I sub~equently observed, and is in-
troduced here to make it more complete. An

NuNs' !!LAND, (that is, the Black Nuns' Island,)
lies in the St. Lawrence, not far, I think, from the
middle of .it, a little below Lachine. The wall
encloses a. considerable space, but yet leaves an
extensive pasture outside, with fruit trees scattered
nbout it, and room for two or·three small buildings.
It is so high as.to shut out the view of the edifices
from any near point, except, 'perhaps, the roof and
some small part of the upper stories. It has lmt
·one gate, which is generally closed, and sufficiently
watched by three or four yardmen, to keep out all
persons not allowed to enter, viz. ·such as bring no
permits from the Bishop, or the 'Superior of the
Seminary nnd Hotel ·Dieu Nunnery. The yard-
men, as..at the nunriery, are never allowed.to enter
~he buildings, unlessit··be:such parts as are devoted
to the stable, fuel, &c.
The buildings are three in number. The lar·
gest stands in front, the scconcl behind it, and the
third at right angles, on the right, ns you enter
the first; and the last is that which I first entered.

the winter·; and doors open on several sides. One
of them lends into a place which I thought very
singular, and the use of which I could not imagine.
It is a large room without furniture, with a stone
floor, lighted, I believe, only by n small grated
windqw, with about four panes of glass. In the
midst ·of this room is a small one, capable of
'Containing about twenty persons, entirely unfur~

The second and smallest building, which is in
the rear of this, I was in but tluec times. It ·has
two stories, with a number of small rooms, and lit·
He furniture. It appeared to bo principally devoted
to the priests, when I was there, as I recollect see·
ing a number of priests there, and several·musical
instruments lying about.
The third building has a- staircase loading up
from the visiters' room, which 1 first entered, into
the second story, which is occupied by sleeping·
rooms, with a passage on one side into which they
open.
I have been in the garret·of the third building•
It is not ·partitioned off·into rooms, but all thrown
into one, if I except n small part towards one end,
where pigeons are cattght..'rher'e isa large looking· . \;
glass, so ·placed that the birds may see themselves
in it as they fly by; and, some wheat being scatte~
ed near, considerable numbers are caught, most of
which ·are killed, and sent to market in :Montreal.
'l1
he pigeons, being deceived, and taking.di~ir ow11
shado\Ys{or other birds, are induced to· stop, and ,
are then attracted·in by the·food; until they .cannot
escape. This i~ ti very common w_
ay of taking
them in Canada. While in the garret, l some·
times looked out of the windows, and enjoyed a
fine view. I could see the river St. Lawrence for
a considerable distance, with boats of Canadians or
Indians passing down, or crossing to the village of
Oaughnawaga, which was also in sight, as well'oe
the river's banks for some miles. According to
14 .,
\.
158 BLACK NUNNERY.
my recollection, there are windows only at one end,
and on one side of the.garret.
. They have a ciergerie, or candle-room in one of
the buildings, where, however, only tallow candles
arc manufactured; there is sometimes a good deal
of work.to be performed in that branch of busi-
ness.
One day Father Phelan met me in the' Pink
Room, and informed me that he had !omething for
me to <lo. I of course did not dare to object, much
less to disobey, after the solemn obligations of my
oath, and the hazard, or rather certainty of punish·
mcnt: I felt myself to be no less in the power of
others there, than·when I was in the nunnery, and
boHeved that disobedience would be as surely fol·
lowed with a heavy penalty. Besides, I believed
that all authority was vested in the Priests, by tho
divine law; and was disposed, on this account, (at
least a great portion of the time,) blindly to follow
their commands and indications, without presuming
to question;the propriety of them. ·
:Father Phelan told me that I should meet with
L'Esperance in the other building, that is, the se·
col'id,-in an apartment which he mentioned ; and
he wished me to take him to a chamber, which he
described, and give him n glass of wine. I should
find ·two bottles,·he informed me, in the cupboard
in that room, one of them marked with a paper,
ancl that I should pour out for him a tumbler full
from that, and might drink some from the other

nddicted to drinlc, and always ready for wine. I
might, under other circumstances, have questioned
the object of the step .required, or inqnired what
was the reason for proceeding in such'a manner ;
whether there was any thing mixed with the wine
in either bottle, and if so, w:hat, and in which.
But how could I dare to do so in my present situa-
tion 1 I can hardly think that any consideralion
would have induced me. I therefore proceeded to ·
the place indicated, nnd met J..}Esperance, invited
him to tnke some wine, and led him to the apart-
ment. On opening the cupboard, I found twc> bot·
tles, as I had been told I should, one with a paper
upon it; and filling a tumbler from it with red
wine, and another from the other, I presented the
former to L'Esperance, and taking the other, began
to drink. · Suddenly it occurred to me, with an im-
pression of horror, which I cannot describe, that if
there was poison in the wine I had given to the
priest, I should ~ the cause of his death. Phelan
had threatened, in the Convent, to give him a dose
that should be his last; ai;.d was not this tqe \Tay in ·"
which he intended to accomp!ish his purpose 1 My
feelings were entire!ytoo strong to be restraiRed.. I
became in an instant ove·rpowered with the coJl'ViC·
tion of the truth ; and I believe that no threat or
punishment in the- p01wer of those-around me to in.
flict, would have indueed me any longer io pu!tsue
the .plan on which I was proeeeding.
I turned round to look at the priest, and saw
that he had not hesitated to take off the dr.au.ght. I
• 160 BLACK NUNNJmY.
had presented to him, and was then drinking the
dregs of the cup. What l felt, it would be useless
for me to attempt to ,describe. I put down the
glass I held in my own hand, a considerable por-
tion from which I had .swallo\ved, and hastened
out of the roon wit~out speaking, in a state of mind
distressing beyond endurance. · I left the house,
ran across the yard to that from which rhad pro.
ceeded, rus~ed into the room ·in which I lmd left
father.Phelan, and threw myself upon the sofa. A
new .thought had-occurred to me on·the way. Per-
haps my wine: had· been pois~ned, .either by de-
sigo or.acciJent: for how did I .know.that the pa-
per had not been put upon the wrong bottle, or
what reason had I to confide in the honour of any
perso.n.· who would treat another . as I supposed
L'E$perance had been treated~ In my extreme agi·
tation of mind, . I did not stop to reason : .but my
fears led me to believe the most dreadful thing
which 1 suggested· itsel£ , I therefore at once em·
braced the'idea ·that I was .poisoned,.nnd w~s soon
to die: in agony. I began to cry, and , soon -to
scream with , horror, .t·egardless of every ·thing
around me. Some ()f,the old nuns·came to my as-
sistance, and first asked.me·to be quiet, and then
commanded ·me, ;}est others:should learn the cause;
but for a long time they found it impossible to paci-
fy ~e.-· From some remarks which fell frc;>m them,

TnERE were !:cveral beds in the same room,
occupied by young women, whose health was fee-
ble. 'Vhile I remained in the room, there were
several changes among the other occupants: for
sometimes one would enter, and occasionally an-
other would leave us. The names of many I never
heard, and some of them seemed to be almost en-
tirely unknown to each other. These were co~­
monly reserved and silent, apparently averse to
communicating any thing, and not well satisfie4
with their condition or company. Some of thos~
who left the room while I was in it, I afterwards
met with in some of the apartments ; but others I
never saw again nor heard o£
What could lJe the object of having so many
young women assembled here-who they were,
and whence they had come, were natural ques-
tions : but at first I had no one to answer them.
The reserve and depression observable in such
as I have mentioned, were not by any means exhi-
bited by all. Sev~ral of my room-mates, on the
contrary, were very willing to converse, and in-
deed quite communicative. From these I soon de-
rived information w·hich explained what would

otherwise have appeared mysterious. I may, per-
haps, best'convey to my readers the impressions
which I receh·ed1 by giving it to them as I myself
received it.
There was a young woman \Vbo occupied the
bed directly opposite mine, who was called Ange·
lique. She was among the most communicative
of all, afld one of the first who talked . with me.
She felt no unwillingness to make known to me
her history, and conver~ed with apparent frankness
and sincerity. Sho was of middling stature, slen-
der, with dark eyes nnd hair. She informed· me
that she had once been in the Congregational Nun·
nery, but arrived at the Island a few \Veeks before
·from ·New York, \Vhere she had resided for some
time ; and that her visit to Canada wns owing to
her intimacy with a distinguished , personage, at
whose house she used frequently to resort. Sho
stated that she used to .go to his residence some·
times in the drf:ss of a man, ·at evening; and .on
one occasion felt much apprehension of being .dis-
c'overed. She happened to be.lat(, and,had to make
1
so much noise to gain admittance, that she attract·
·· ed the .attention, not only of two men who appear·
ed to be at watch on a neighboring corner, but of
the neighbors, who raised their windows to see
what was the matter, when, seeing a head with a
night·cap at the window, some one laughed in a
way,calculated to express, and at the·same time to
excite · suspic~on. ·· "She ·continued in th!:. practico
until it was thought necessarv, for the sake of eon·
164 BLACK MVNNERV.
cealment, to send her to a retired place for a time;
and ahe accordingly proceeded to Canada, and was
received on Nuns' Island, She informed me fur-
ther, that she had then become a mother, had had
her child taken from her immediately, ~n<l had not
seen it since ; and eJipected to return to New
York when her health should be restore,"{,
She told me that most of the young women I
saw, were from the United States. · They were the
victims of priests, who ha4;_access to them in the
schools and nunneries, to which they were attach·
ed. Some, I understood, were " Sisters of Chatity,"
as they are called in this country, who had left
their missions for a time on similar emergencies;
but most of them.were natives of the states, attach·
ed to the nunneries there, either as nuns, novices,
or scholara. These had come off-under different
pretences; the place of their retreat, as well aa the
cause of their journey, being kept a profound ·se-
cret fro~ their friends. I got the impression .that
Angelique was one of the " Sisters of Charity"
herself, though I am not certain that she told ·
me so.
She urged me to·return to New York 'vith her,.
saying I should prefer it to Canada, and used such
arguments na she supposed would incline me to
accede to her proposition. As for herself, she said
ahe.should suffer nothing on account of her expe·
dition ·to the island, as nobody could ever discover
that she had gone there for any thing but a com-
mon visit to Canada.

One of the yonng women, who conversed some·
what freely with me, was calle(l Miss Gordon,
which I presnmo was her real name. She was
small, good-looking, with light hair, and had a scar
on her lip. She told me that she had been in n
Convent in some part of the United States, but not
as a nun-I suppose, as a scholar; and had come
to the Island for the same reason ns many of the
others, having been sent there by the he~d priest.
She was soon to return, and told me that she
was resol.ved to leave the Convent, and to return

to it no more. She carefully abstained from men-
tioning the place of her residence ; and this is
all I recollect about her, except that her infant had
been taken from her, (as I was informed was tho
common practice,) to be placed in the 01·pha1&
Asylum, at the Gray Nunnery.
Several of the young women told me they had
come from the United St~tes, and mentioned their
places of ·residence ; but from my ignorance of the
country, I did not pm·ticularly regard them, nol'
can I now remember them. One said she had been
there several times, and had sent several infants to
the Gray Nuns, and hoped to live to come adozen
times more. I judged her to be one of the "Sistel's
of Charity," because she wore a hood like theirs.
One of these young women had a peculiar sear
on her cheek, and a mole on her lip, which I well
remember, and should know again anywhere. I
have· wished, when meeting any of the "Sisters
of Charity," in New York, to have their hoods

raised, as I might, perhaps, 1·ecognisl' some of
them. Possibty I might find the peculiar scnr, u.nd <
the mole on one of theh· faces, or something else, 1 a
hnve seen on N nns' Islnnd-nt least so I sometime~ I
think. I ha,·e bern told by n young Catholic .wo- <
man, in New Yorlc, that mnny of the •· Sisters of
Charity" are Canadians, ond that she knew one J,
who could hardly !!peak the En.~lish language. I n
recollect· to have seen several, at different times, n
while .in the school of the Congregational Nun- "
nery, taking leave, to go,,on missions to L'Arne- tl
rique, os they sometimes called the United States. •i
One of the women remarked; in conversation
one day, that the priests had more children born ou
that Island in a' year, than there commonly are in
a good-sized country village.
There were several arrivals of young women,
while l ·was on the island, and several left it, but I
never saw them coming or going, and was com·
monly left to infer it from circumstances which
came under my notice. Some of the priests, I be·
lieve, were frequently going and coming : as the're
is no obstacle in the way of those who have the
necessary authority.
A few.days before my leaTing the place, I miss-
ed Angelique from her bed, and on inquiry, was
informed that she had left the island. She might
have been gone a day or two before I missed her:
for as we went to bed and rose when we pleased.

, and Return to the llotel Dleu.
IT \Vould be impossible for me to form any esti·
mate, on which I could place reliance, of .the num·
ber of men or women . I saw on Nuns' Island.
There was no regular .dme for breakfast, dinner
or supper. No be11 was rung, no notice was given
for meals, any more than for retiring at night, or
rising in the morning. Food was always prepa·
red and ready, when any of us were disposed to eat;
and we went when\ ve chose, alone or in company,
to the eating-room, at one end o( t.he building, anrl
helped ourseh•es in true Canadian style.
Many of my readers may not be aware of the
style of eating practised among many of the lower
Canadians. So many of the priests are of Cana·
dian origin, that their meals in the nunnery, and
on the island, are often disposed of in .a rude and
unmannerly way, with but little use of knives and
forks. We often ate standing, while on the island,
and it was common to take even meat in the
fingers.
As there was no general call, or occasion for as·
sembling at any time, the inmates resorted to their
rooms, or lounged about the galleries, yard, or sit·
ting-rooms, as they pleased: so that it would_have

been impossible to count them all, even if I had
been disposed. But I did not ever think of do·
.
1ng so. ., ••.
·~ Some of the priests, as I understood, were there
on penai1ces. · This was indeed a merPly nominal
thing. Pri; sts who have .been complained of by
their parishioners, in ·a formal manner, are some·
times sent by the bishop to Nuns' bland, and some·
times to the Priests' Farm, to satisfy their accusers
with the form of punishment. I had reason, how·
ever, to beiieve that they generally suffered no pri·
vations, and were far from regarding their rcsi·
dence as a place of punishment. On the contrary,
I often saw them partake of indulgences. The
edifice numbered 3, was spe~ially devoted to the
priest:s : but th~y enjoyed much liberty, and were
allowed to go wherever they pleased.
Among their occupations, some occasionally
s:rcn.t a while in reading; and I saw a number of
b0oks lying about in se\·eral rooms, which the wo·
men w~re not expected to look at. Some played
flutes and sang.· I have sometimes heard several '
of them play together. Most of their .music, how·
ever, was voca] ; and while I was on the island I
heard a variety of songs sung, particularly thoso
which were most popular in the nunnery.
The women, that is those whose health would
permit, had a variety of work to perform, particu·
larly with the needle. Sometimes nn order would
come from the Superior of the n unnery, to make
a number of towels or sheets. nnd sometimes six

or eight shirts were ordered for some priest, in
great haste. . The old nuns would call upon us to
assemble, and gave us no 'peace till they were
done. · Orders sometimes c:inie for ~he Seminary,
Nunnery, Priests' Farm, and 'B~hop. .Jt com-
monly happened, however, that the g~eater part of
the job was performed by a few of th.e most indus-
trious or good-natured ones; for the cr,oss and in·
flolent would contrive to get off their'part on who-
ever ·would do it. At certain season.s of the year
large quantities of soap were made, and then old
Aunts Margaret and Susan are sent"from the nun-
nery to manage that department. Butter and
cheese are made from the mille of the cows Jcept
on the island ; and several of the nuns most expert·
in making them, are employed in the dairy.
.v
I had often noticed a young woman, apparently
rather older than myself. with a 'peculiarly un- .
happy.and depressed countenance; but I had never
spokeu' 'vith her. One day I was set' to sew with'
her on the same piece-a 'sheet which was to be
made. We sat together sewi~;~g a·whole afternoon,
during which littl.e or nothing \Vas said by either
of us. ·· 'Vhen.. it grew too dark to do any more,
and our work was laid aside, we kept our places,
and she began to converse with a degree of free-
clam which I had not expected. We were at the
end of the long gallery in the building No. 1, near
the window where I often sat,·. and knew that we
could not be overheard.

a situation, to which I replied with equal freedom,

~ore.. .:lndeed,,she must have known, that if she
gr.ve ·.11e opportunity to accuse her of complainin~.
and to get her subjected to severe penances or pun-
ishment, I equally committed myself.
She then went on to sp~a}, of her early life, and
the place.of her former .residence, which I do not
recollect, although she named it. I. have the im·
pression that it was s~mewhere . i~ Upper Canada,
a retired and pleasant.spot. She said, that she long·
ed to get away from the ~un~.and priests, but )mew
not how. She was a nun in some Convent, I do
not know where; .and her Superior was very harsh
in her treatment, and had put some dreadful pen·
nnces ·upon her. Once in particular, she had near-
ly destroyed her life; for she made her lie, for se·
vernl weeks, upon a bed made of ropes, which·
weakened and injured her so much, that she was
unable to sit up for six weeks. .If: we could con-
trive any way of.escaping from the .Jsland, we'·
might find our way to her native place, whete she
would be cet;tain of getting a good and c~mfortable
residence, for me as well as herself. At the same
time she spoke of it as utterly hopeless, shut up
and watched as we were. She spoke ·of the pen-
ances she had endured, with a kind of horror ;.and
said it was hard for her to believe that·it was by
means of such sufferings that anybody could get
to heaven. Indeed, she said heaven must be a
172 BLACK NUNNERY.
dreadful place, if such trials as she was suojeet to,
were the way of introduction to it.
She did not speak particularly of the occasion
of her visit to the Island : but, from thcr state of
her health, and other circumstances, · I had no
doubt that it was similar to that which had brought
many others there.
I found that her melancholy was that of despair.
While speaking of her home, she seemed, indeed,
to forget, for a moment, that it was impossible for
her ever to see it again, and exclaimed, " 0, how
happy we should be, living there together I" But
then, when recurring again to her actual condi-
tion, she assured me that she constantly prayed for
death, and sometimes thought seriously that she
would take her own life.
I felt very much for her, and once told her I
would almost venture to ·attempt an escape with
her. She said that would be entirely useless-we
had no chance at all. I afterwards trembled to
think how I had exposed myself, and that she
might possibly inform against me : but this she
never did.
I was not particuJar in noticing the number of
days I spent on Nuns' Island: but I believe I was
there very nearly three weeks.. I am certain, at
least, that three Sundays passed while I was there.
One evening an old nun told m'e I was to return
to the nunnery ; and that night I set out in com·
pany with three priests, and several nuns, after

~~· RETURN TO THE NUNNER~
Savage was one of th'3 priests, and Bruneau an-
other. The latter was then confessor at the nun-
nery. Sainte Mary, I remember, was one of the '
nuns in company, and two others were old nuns,
who expressed much regret at leaving the place,
saying, that if there was any th~ng to be done in
the nunnery more than common, they must al·
ways be sent for.
We proceeded from the gate of the wall ·on foot
to the shore, where Jacques and Pierre were ready
with their boat; and having entered it, they rowed
across to the river's shore, where we found a cha·
rette waiting for us, in which we rode to the city.
The driver stopped at the nunnery gate, from
which I had started with L'Esperance, and having
alighted and rung, we were admitted into the nun·
nery through the chapel, the sacristy, and the long
passage I have more than once alluded to, in my
former work. Proceeding to the Superior's room,
she received me; and, having made me take off
my cloak and leave it there, she conducted me
into the nuns' sleeping-room, where I retired to "
bed.
· The next morning, when Jane Ray met me, she
addressed me with a sarcastic look, saying-
" '\Vell, so you've been to the White Cats' cas·

,..
· I never heard the name of L'Esperance men-
tioned after this, except on two occasions. Father
Phelan one day remarked, " So you gave him a

was dead with poison, if evidence was wanted to
make me feel certain of it. A considerable time
afterwards, while I was in the sick-room, 1 was
called to attend a mass, to be celebrated in hono1·
of VEsperance; so that hi1 death was then no
longer to be doubted. .

CHAPTER XVIII.
Dr. NolloD-1111 vialtl to the Nunnery aick·room-A ni~bt visit to Uu1
vaui~An alurm at ni3ht.
THE following chapter has been written since
the preceding \vas in the printer's hands. The
contents were brought to my mind by certain re-
cent 'circumstances. · I have occasionally thought
of them before, but did not think of writing them.
I have remarked more than once, I was employ-
ed, for several of the last months which I spent in
the nunm•ry, in attend3nce on the nuns 'in tho
sick~room. This.is numbered 3 in my plan of t~e
second story, given iri .~Y first volume. I have
now to mention some circumstances whir.h occur-
red in the course of that time, previously to which
I may state a few·thing's in relation to the practi-
ces there.
Dr: Nelson commonly paid his ~oming visit at
about nine o'clock, and'after he was gone, the office
of the Virgin Mary was performed, which oc~t!,pi"!~
ed a long;time, and consisted of manyprayors, ~\~.'!
attended with various and tiresome postures, '.Vluch

~
Dr. Nelson had often much to say to the Supe-
rior. But one day I observed him in conversation
with her, after he had visited the sick, at a time
when I wished him away. It was Monday morn·
ing; and then there was always an additional
umount of work to be done, and more hurry than
usual in doing it : for at that time more priests
than on other days come into the nunnery; and as
they frequently passed through the sick-room, the
Superior wished to have evcr.y thing in good or-
der. The sheets were changed on that day, and
the .Superior, who was always particu~ar in hav·
ing things right there, would insist G»n our being
quick. ·
It must have been on a Monday m~ning when 1
saw the Doctor talking '\\:ith the Superior,.because
I remember that when I saw him, I t~ought he
would interfere with my prompt performance of
the laborious task I had before me. The. Superior
soon called me to her, and, I remember~ used a
term which she often did wnen disposed to coax us
to any thing-"' .

will come this eve~ing to get it; and when all is

mention any thing of this to the old nuns, for they
will tell the Bishop."
She then gave me two keys, which I took; and
then attended to the work I had to do. That even-
ing, at about half past nine, I went down to the
Superior's room, ready, in case of meeting any one
by the way who might question me, to say that I
was on business to the Superior, as she had told
me to answer. I was surprised to find Dr. Nelson
with her. They both rose, and proceeded with
me through the first story, to the little covered pas-
sage leading into the sacristy. Crossing that, we
came to a door at the corner, which I had never
noticed before; and that the Superior intended to
open, but found she had left the key behind. She
therefore made me and the doctor·wait while she
returned to get it ; but after a time she came back,
having been unable to find it.
The Superior then said that we must go another
way ; and leading us to the door which opens into
the church of the Convent, went under the alta!
and raised a trapdoor. Below this was another,
fastened by a large iron bolt, which the doctor re-
moved; and beneath we saw the steps which Jed
into the vaults. - ·· "' ..
I had been in the vaults before, bu,t not by this
way. There is a trapdoor in the floor of the
church, not far, I should think, from the middle.
but nearer th,e altar than the front door ; and by
that I had gone down on some occasions of burial.
The steps were carpeted. One night, I reco~}ect,
. >
178
I was sent there with some othtlrs, ia consequence
of the fears ofthe Superior, who thought old Susan
might have left some fire there, as she had gone
down with 11 light. I well remember the dr.ead
'vith which I passeli along the gloomy place, and
the thought that some of the many dead- persons
there might rise and catch bold of me.
But to return to the occ86ion of which l was
J
t
speal{ing. The doct.or, I remember, remarked '1
that he had never been there before. When he fi
l1ad openecl the door, he came up, and· ~ing to the G
front door of the church, ·called in two- me11 who- s'
were waiting there, and then we all went down 1i
together. The smell o( the place was oppPessivc- K
nnd disagreeable, as I hafl before found it The OJ
men took the coffin of Sainte Agnes, brought it up, tQ
nnd carried it into the street. The Superior anct w
myself accompanied them to the door. It was a
hateful ni'ght, the air, I recollec~. \:Yas cold; and I
stood a little behind the S'Pperior; tiU the doctor
and his men were gone; when she dosed the door,.
nnd locked and bolted it. The nnndle, I recollect..
was brass, and the inside considerably ornamented·.
Some ,things occurred in the nunnery which I
n~er fully understood. There was a dreadful
alarm one·night, during my attendance in the sick
room, the recoltection of which is very painful to
me. 'While I was sitti'ng lt}', I heard shrieks at
some distance, but Bo loud that I sprung up imme·
diately, as did all tile sick nuns ,\rlio were able,

turn to their beds and lie down; for I knew the
Superior would blame me severely, if she should
come ·in and fiml ihem in such coafusion. The
screams, however, continued, and they would not
pay any attention to me, until they ceased, whiclt
they did in a short time. They then lay down,
and every thing became .pret~y tranquil again. It
was very .plain, however, that the curiosity of aU
was excited by so ex.traordi-nary a noise, though.
fney were not allow~d to talk about jt, and or
oourse kept silence. ..My first thought was, that
some person was ooder.going g1·eat suffering in the
little room to which I have se11e.ral times referred '
in my fi:rst vo-lume, us,the room of the three states,
or the Purgatory caamber : but the sounds seemed
too distant fer.that, and I presumed the sufferer,
whoever it was, must be farther off in some apart-
ment in that direction. There was a shrillness in
·the sounds at first that made me think the voice that
'Of a nun:; but they afterwards seemed more like
that of a ftlan.
While [ was reflecting on the .subject, after the
lapse of a short time, the Superior opened the door,
and passed. raptdly through the sick-room, accom-
paniea by a .few old .nuns, without speaking·a word:
She afterwards passed again and again. The last
'time she passed, I was .j~ the sitting-room.; and. it
,happened, (owing to he~1 flurry, as I presume,)
that. she locked the ·do&t.that. led into the sick- .
roo~. A few moments .after, ~he screams began.
11.gaint·mo11e loud and ·dreadful fhau_before, so that
180
I sprung up and pulled at the door, to preTent
another scene of confusion among the sick nuns,
and then first found it locked. I could hear them
moving, and perceived that they were in a dread-
ful state of horror. Every moment the shrieks
seemed more terrific, till it appeared as if several
voices were mingled, at their 1tighest pitch. At
Jength they ceased, and I never heard a word said
on the subject afterwards, nor obtained any light
whatever of the origin or cause. The night I
spent seems to me one of the most dreadful I can
recollect in the whole course of my life.
I have seen the short letter from Dr. Nelson,
(the nunnery physician,) which is inserted in the
book called "Awful Exposure," publishedbyMessrs.
Jones & Leclerc, in opposition to my " Awful Dis·
closures;" and as he professes never to have seen
me in that institution, it has occurred to me that I
may assist his memory, not only by narrating the
preceding account of our visit to the vaults of the
church to obtain the body of S!linte Ag~. but by
.requesting his attention to other circumstances
which he can hardly have forgotten..
I wo~ld therefore address myself particularly tO'
Dr.·Nelson, and ask him if he remembers, about
the spring of 1834, entering the nuns' sick-room,
(No. 4, in the second story of my phm ofthe veiled
department,) and speaking with'a patient who occu·
pied the bed in the corner on the right hand ~

Doea he remember calling again that aftemonn,
dressed in a colored round·jacket, figured waist·
coat, white &rousers, and grayish colored hat, ac·
companied by a toll, handsome young man, with
light hair and a gold watch chain, who had often
been sent by him before with messages about medi~
cines, &c.~ Does he remember, that after speaking·
and laughing. with several patients, and: saying
something to or about "little Mary," (a nun 'vhoni
they both knew,) he spoke with the sick nun first
mentioned, who was bathing her:feet on the left
side of the room 1 Docs he remember calling the
little nun in attendance again·into the'sitting-room,
and telling her to state to the·Superior his opinion
of the case, with his advice to have her removed up
~tairs ~ Does·he recollect the name of that little
nun to whom he gave the message~ Ifnot, I can
assist ltim. Her name was Maria Monk.
Perhaps he. may have forgotten also in · what ··
place he commonly washed his hands, and what
ho said one day to a nun as she handed him a tow-
el. Also,.the oranges he brought in privately for
little Betsey, and his request to have them placed
in the cupboard, to be given to her a few at a time,
to avoid the notice of the Superior.
For that young girl, little Betsey . I felt, and al·
ways shall feel. a peculiar interest. She had beau-
tiful black eyes, was remarkably handsome, and

her disposition was to be friendly and true. I did
~ot .mention 'her in my first volume, lest I should
be the cause of her su1fering in some way or other.
It is ~ot my intention now to add more than a sin·
gle paragraph r.especting her. .
She told me one day, that in consideration of a
sum of money paid to Father Dufresne, by a young·
officer, whose name she mentioned, he was allow-
ed to take her from the nunnery, and place her in
a hired lodging in a part of the Government
House, not under my mother's charge, where she
remained for several weeks. She was present at·
the theatre and at other public places, where she
appear~ under a feigned character, and was after-
wards brought back to the nunnery, as a large sum
of money was pledged for her restoration.
I also know, from certain facts, that this was-not
a solitaey instance of the kind.

I wAs ahvays 'fond of music from a child. I
have never received much instruction even in sing·
ing: my only teachers having been a few priests,
wh·o, as I mentioned in my first volum~, used occa-
sionally to come into the nunnery on Saturdays,
and lead the nuns in performing some or"the chants
and hymns which were used in the chapel.
In my childhood I heard a variety of songs, par-
ticularly among the Canadians, imd in the French
language ; but in the nunnery I often used to hear
the priests sing a number which were entirely new
to me. All these contained expressions more or
less disgusting and immoral; and there is not one
of ~;h~m which I have been able to recal, that I
should be willing to see printed in full. Indeed,
although there are .but few which I can now re:
member entire, there are ver15es or lines in all
which a regard to morality should never allow me
to make known. A few specimens I have conclu-
ded to give, of such passages as are not objectiona-
ble, with a general account of the nature and sub-
jects of the rest, since I have been advised to do
so, by persons whos·
e opinions I respect.
I should remark, by the way of explaining why
BLACK NIJNN Y.
I have never mentioned them before, that t~
thought even of alluding to them in a book, never
occurred to me, u til a few weeks before the ·pru-
~~t v:olume ~as put to press. I h~d ofteQ caugllt
myself~inging my infant to sleep with tunes I ~a4
heard in the nunnery ; ~md my friend~ pad'.fre-
quently noticed that I sung airs with which !hey
were ·Unacquainted. But l never mentioned the
peculiar character of nunnery so~ to anyof them.
or repeated .a single verse of them, until one day
when .the subjeet was introduced by accident, while
c:onversing about the fight that occurred between
Bishop Lartigue, old Bonin, and other· priests,
which I have described in a previous chapter of
t'his volume. I then alluded to the aftray. I was
questioned abo11t its origin ; and having mentioned
the offensive song which was the cause of it, 1 wa.S
asked for othe:rs. Several persons, being informed of
their nature, expressed the opinion that they con-
tained in themselves an important kind of evidence,
and a desire that something respecting them might
be introduced into the present volume. After some
hesitation I consented; and sueh extracts antl re-
marks as seem proper, will be found on the sue·
.ceeding pages.
I may remark, that those who have urged me to·
take this step, have done so on the following
grounds :-1st. That if it should pro•.;c that these
songs are not known in Canaclf.l, out of the nunnery,
as I believe to be the case, they will afford n stl'ong
evidence to the reader that I must have learnt them

in the nunnery, wh~~h 1s ~he fact. . 2d. That b~ing
s~ng by priests, and in some cases at leaat, composed
by them, .they afford witness to the truth of what I
have said of their character and conduct, thus con·
demning them out of their own mouths. Certain
it is that they are very favorite songs with them,
especially some of the most objectionable ; as I
have heard them, in spite of myself, repeated over
and over again, particularly when the priests were
engag~d in drinking and gaming.
I am not well acquainted with the French lan-
guage, and there are some words and lines here
which I do not understand, and cannot get explain-
ed. I never saw any of these songs on paper be·
fore.

There was onea a priest named FranciaMar;otlet wbo dre...

• Good-day, Mr. Godreau," {said he,) making hisbows a ancl
with compliment• to the company, he made a handeome ID'!'
tranee, and began to talk about thiDB• of ~onaequence.
{Here follow several verses which I but imP,er'!'
fectly remember. They intimate, that after coming
into the house disguised as a citizen, making n citi·
zen's bow, and talking of common things, of which
a priest is ignorant, he m_editated how to carry in-
to effect a plan for the ruin of Godreau's daughter,
which he had boasted to some of his friends that he
could accomplish. Here the father is introduced
as addressing him :)

Speak, speak, friend priest : you can talk ; for you have wit./
In spite of your indiscretion, you are a man of genius. I have
understood what you have boasted of. To pay you, I am go-
ing to give you a shovel." &c. (And then ·the song gives an
account of abeating the priest received with a fire-shovel, and
his ludicrous complaints.}

CONCLUSION.
' I
f'
I
I IIAVE now concluded nll the " further Dilclo·
sures" which I deem it important to make, iii rela-
tion to the Hotel Dieu·Nunnery.· 'fhere are manJ ·
incidents which have been brought to my memory,
while I have been employed in preparing the pre-
ceding pages; and I might · ~ame ·and describe
many othL. persons with whom I had some ac·
quaintance, or of whom ~ heard particulars of dif·
ferent kinds. It is necessary, however, to put some
limits to myself;·· and, although I may not be the
best judge of what is most important to ~e known
to my readers, I think I have not kept back any
thing indispensable to them...
So far as I have been able, consistently with
truth, and the interests of many, I have endeavored
to avoid giving pain to individuals, by exposing
•. what I lmow, even though they be 'culpable, and
some of them highly so. My object has not been
wanton}y to destroy peace ; and of this I think seve-
ral persons will be convinced when they find that

I have not mentioned in this book things which
they know I am acquainted with. .

not allude in my first volume to the fact that I sa\v
