I could feel the pull of the undertow. I knew nothing about undertow. I sat down in the water. The undertow pulled me out into the ocean and flipped me all around. I felt a deep sense of peace and a feeling that I was going to drown. There was no panic only peace. I thought to myself, 'I wonder how far this has taken me out into the ocean?' I also thought calmly, 'I am going to drown.' I also had a panoramic view of my life - there was no sense of time - I didn't know how long this was all taking. There was some sense of God being in control of the situation; however, I did not specifically see any Being. Then, suddenly, I was 'let go' and I came to the top of the water. I was not far from shore. I was with a friend. She was on shore laughing at me. She said it looked 'funny'. I never told her (or anyone else) for a long time I did not know this was an 'NDE'. Years later, I heard someone on TV describe exactly what happened to me. They had been in a near drowning experience as well.
