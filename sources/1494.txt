MYERS IS BACK
A new biography by Trevor Hamilton has restored to centre stage F.W. H. Myers (1843-
1901), the leading mind of the Society for Psychical Research.
The biography has been warmly welcomed by leading survival research blog Metgat (22
June 2009)1
which concludes:
Hamilton offers a very interesting, intriguing, informative, in-depth,
and even inspirational look at one of history's most overlooked and
unappreciated contributors. One wonders if or when modern
psychology will ever escape from the muck and mire of scientific
fundamentalism and catch up with Myers.
However, the biography does raise again the question of whether Myers, who when
young suffered from acute snobbery, failed to fully appreciate the phenomena of the
(mainly lower class and less educated) Spiritualist movement. The extent of any such bias
is carefully assessed by Hamilton (p.263-7).
One critical phase, before the 1882 foundation of the SPR, was the investigation of the
Newcastle physical mediums by the Sidgwick group, who seem to have concluded they
were mercenary frauds. Yet Madame D’Esperance was the author of an important
analysis of her own mediumship (“Shadowland” 1897) while Paul Gaunt has argued in
“Noah’s Ark Review”2
that Miss Wood when young was remarkable.
Another such phase arose in the mid-1880s when some Spiritualists lead by Stainton
Moses withdrew from active involvement in the SPR because of a felt bias against
phenomena. Mrs Sidgwick welcomed this departure, though the subsequent cold war
lasted a century.
The new biography makes a conspicuous attempt to tell the story of the Blavatsky
enquiry in detail without bias. It even adds another bit of phenomenal evidence - that
Eveleen Myers heard what could have been the bell sound (it has been known for some
years that Myers and Gurney had heard this bell, but their experience was deleted from
the original published reports)
Another innovation is that the post-mortem activity attributed to Myers is also
considered. Trevor Hamilton told a lecture audience at the National Portrait Gallery on 18
June that he hopes to make a more detailed examination of the Cross-Correspondences in
the future. What perhaps is not generally known is that Eveleen Myers accepted the

Frederic Myers communications through Geraldine Cummins, and bought 27 copies of
“The Road to Immortality” to give to friends ( Hamilton, p.300).
Among the images displayed by Hamilton was one of Eusapia in an academic gown.3
The intellectual framework partly created by Myers, in which psychic phenomena are
placed in a continuum leading to survival and mystical experience, has been hugely
influential in psychic studies , and popularised for example in Tyrrell’s “ The Personality
of Man”. It is also one of the foundations of Paul Beard’s modern statement of
Spiritualist philosophy.
So serious students need to know about Myers, especially those doing educational
courses in the paranormal. Trevor Hamilton’s biography, with its extensive bibliography
and up to date discussion, will meet that need admirably.

______________
On page 88 of, Immortal Longings, Hamilton refers to Frederic Myers, sitting with the
physical medium Charles Williams on 20th
November 1873. In an interview with his
widow Eveleen Myers, published in Light June 1, 1934 on page 332 she gives some
details of this extraordinary séance: -
MRS. F. W. H. MYERS’
RECOLLECTIONS
THE STRANGE ADVENTURE OF F. W. H. MYERS WITH “JOHN KING”
_____________
WILL posterity ever discharge its debt of gratitude towards the pioneers of Psychical
Research? Of the many memories which we hold dear, none has been less dimmed by
the passage of the years than that of F. W. H. Myers. He passed over almost a
generation ago; but, in his monumental work, Human Personality, his giant intellect is
ever within our reach.
There is also a living link between his legacy and his spirit. Mrs. F. W. H. Myers is
still with us; but, although fully appreciative of the importance of her husband’s work
and of the legitimacy of the public interest in his personality, she has hitherto been very
reluctant to serve as a vehicle for publicity of any sort. Our special thanks are therefore
3
http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait.php?LinkID=mp07354&page=4&rNo=36&role=art
158
due to her for letting this article stand as an exception to the principle that she has
observed all her life.
No one has been more impressed than she with the evidence of Mr. Myers’ survival
that has accumulated since his death; but these scientific evidences do no more than
fortify beliefs, which, ultimately, derive their strength from the religious intuitions that
underline them. In other words, her experiences in psychical research have given her a
welcome confirmation of convictions that have always placed personality at the very
centre of things. “I feel certain of my husband's survival,” she said, “because I believe
in Jesus Christ. And I consider it my husband's greatest achievement that by collecting
and interpreting the evidence for survival he has brought faith to so many who have
needed this support.”
“In this matter,” she went on, “I don't think I am taking up an attitude different from
my husband's. Look at what he says here (Human Personality, Vol. II, Page 305) ‘Our
duty is not the founding of a new sect, nor even the establishment of a new science, but
is rather the expansion of Science herself until she can satisfy those questions which the
human heart will rightly ask, but to which Religion alone has thus far attempted an
answer.’ The answer given by Psychical Research is indicated in these words: ‘Has any
world-scheme yet been suggested so profoundly corroborative of the very core of the
Christian revelation? ‘Jesus Christ brought life and immortality to life.’ By his
appearance after bodily death He proved the deathlessness of the spirit.’ And, again,
my husband says: ‘Had the results of Psychical Research been purely negative, would
not Christian evidence-I do not say Christian emotion, but Christian evidence-have
received an overwhelming blow? “
Asked if she had been present at seances during Mr Myers’ lifetime, “Yes,” she
replied, “I have vivid recollections of some of the great mediums of the early days of
Psychical Research. Mrs. Piper, Eusapia Paladino, Mrs. Thompson and others were our
guests for considerable periods, and I came to realise the psychological complexities of
mediumship. Much has been written on Eusapia Paladino’s Cambridge seances in 1895.
She was detected in fraud, but the fact that she resorted to trickery at times is no
proof that she was without true mediumistic powers. I remember how excited and
anxious she was before nearly every sitting. I can hear her saying “Oh, Madame, s’il
n’y aura rien, que ferai-je? Ce sera terrible!” I have seen her produce physical
phenomena in daylight which were so remarkable that to doubt their genuineness was
impossible.
“An experience which my husband could never forget came to him through Charles
Williams at a private sitting in Buckingham Palace Road. ‘John King’ was mani-
festing. A big, hairy hand came down from the ceiling. My husband got hold of it with
both hands. ‘John King’ asked him to let go. He would not, whereupon he was dragged
up from his chair to the top of the table. Still he would not loosen his grip. Then the
hand gradually began to diminish. It became smaller and smaller, as tiny as a newborn
baby's hand, and finally melted away altogether. I remember his account of this incident
159
perfectly well, as it was one that especially impressed him, and he often talked about
it.”
Referring to hypnotism, Mrs. Myers said: “Once in very early days, my husband
made the experiment of trying to hypnotise me. After some passes he suggested that I
couldn’t open my eyes. I attempted to do so and failed. Rather frightened, I stood up
before a mirror in a vain effort to see myself, and tried with all my might, and with the
help of my hands, to open my eyes. But still I found it impossible. From that day on I
had no difficulty in believing in the reality of mesmerism or hypnotism.
“I believe that as a sitter I am naturally a good subject; I mean that through me a
connection seems to be easily established with the unseen world. But, on the other
hand, I am very much on my guard against giving mediums information unawares; and
my standard of what constitutes good evidence is very high; I am not quick to be
impressed by results which some others might consider remarkable.
“People sometimes say that Psychical Research has after all not resulted in anything
very startling. This seems to me a superficial view. When the Society was founded not
even telepathy was established as a fact. And telepathy is a very wonderful discovery.
Then, too, the evidence for apparitions at the time of death is overwhelming, and the
occurrence of may other kinds of supernormal phenomena is practically proved.
Moreover, new paths of investigation are being discovered, the most interesting,
perhaps, being that which Dr. Osty is exploring with such amazing results. As I look
back over the past fifty years, it seems to me that Psychical Research has opened out a
mine of immense wealth, and that treasures will come to light as long as men continue
patiently- to search for them.” -N.F.
_________________
Leslie Price commented to Trevor Hamilton: “But surely Myers was not a Christian at
death, though Eveleen seems to be.” Trevor Hamilton responded:
“I well remember this article. It is quite significant for a variety of
reasons. This was the first time that Eveleen let her guard down in
public on these matters. Interestingly, not long before her death and
after she had read Cummins' 'Myers-inspired' work. She was prepared
to do so in private but hated the spiritual door-steppers who kept
coming up with the latest messages from FWHM beyond the grave.
Secondly, she is quite unambiguous about Palladino, reinforcing the
view that the first private seances with the Myers' family at Cambridge
were impressive.
Thirdly, as you rightly point out, it raises the question of Myers'
attitude to Christianity. There is no doubt that Myers retained in his
160
letters and with his family some of the traditional and conventional
Christian phraseology. It was politic to do so, as it was also politic not
mention that he sat with mediums on Sunday (as he did). However, he
shared Sidgwick's view about the myths and legends that accumulated
around the Christian story, and believed that Christ was a spiritually
developed being but not the Christ of Christian theology - that is the
unique saviour. The idea of the atonement or everlasting punishment
was anathema to him.
He had a first-class but essentially applied intellect. He believed that
his researches (he probably sat with almost a thousand mediums in
total) entitled him to talk with greater authority on the spiritual world
that some smug ecclesiastical member of the House of Lords. The
Synthetic Society (discussion group of the great and the good at the
end of the nineteenth century), of which he Lodge and Balfour were
members, was nearly fractured at one time by the aggressive way in
which he expressed these views. Look up Wilfrid Ward's letter to
Myers in the index of my book to get a sense of the unease over Myers
on this matter.
Myers' final views on the Cosmos was much closer to those of
Plotinus and the Neo Platonists and, for all I know, those who have
worked in various traditions since: namely, one of unending growth,
development and purification, even for the God Head or ultimate
source itself.”

FREDERIC W.H. MYERS ONLINE:
I. General Materials and Reviews of Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death
By
Carlos S. Alvarado
This essay about freely available online resources written about and by Frederic W. H.
Myers (1843-1901) is part of the recent trend recognizing the importance of this
nineteenth-century thinker (Alvarado, 2004; Hamilton, 2009; Kelly et al., 2007; Taylor,
2007). Myers is one of the most interesting and important of the early psychical
researchers. In addition to his writings about phenomena such as mediumship, telepathy
and apparitions, he built bridges between psychical research and psychology through his
discussions of automatisms, secondary personalities, and the subliminal mind.
In this two-part essay I will be concerned with Myers’ psychical research and
psychology, as opposed to his poetry and other writings. An overview of Myers’ life and
work has been presented recently by Hamilton (2009).
In order to facilitate further studies, in the first part of this bibliographical essay I
present online material about Myers (the second part will consist of Myers’ writings).
This is divided into general materials (a general bibliography, biographies, and comments
and overviews on various aspects of his work), and in reviews of Human Personality and
Its Survival of Bodily Death.

About Myers
General
The 1911 entry in the Encyclopaedia Brittanica, as well as the 1901 essays by Lodge,
Richet, and Sidgwick, present general information about Myers. So does the essay by
Arthur C. Benson in his book The Leaves of the Tree (1911). Myers’ own
autobiographical comments in Fragments of Prose & Poetry (1904) are also available.
William James’ classic paper, “Frederic Myers’s Service to Psychology” (1901), is
also included. Here James stated that Myers “took a lot of scattered phenomena, some of
them recognised as reputable, others outlawed from science, or treated as isolated
curiosities; he made series of them, filled in the transitions by delicate hypotheses or
analogies, and bound them together in a system by his bold inclusive conception of the
Subliminal Self, so that no one can now touch one part of the fabric without finding the
rest entangled with it” (p. 16).
Also interesting, and important, were Théodore Flournoy’s 1903 and 1911 writings,
which were similar in content. In the 1903 paper, published in Archives de psychologie,
Flournoy stated he was of the impression that Myers was the “soul, the center, the
supreme engine and the supreme quintessence” (p. 270) of the scientific attempts at the
margin of science that were part of the London-based Society for Psychical Research
(SPR).
The section has other interesting materials, such as Mangin’s 1902 paper about Myers’
ideas of suggestion in the Revue de l’hypnotisme et de la psychologie physiologique, and
an 1896 article in Borderland by X (probably Ada Goodrich-Freer, who wrote for this
magazine), entitled “Mr. Myers on the Subliminal Self with a Map of the Borderland.”
There is also a fragment of Emily Kelly’s “F.W.H. Myers and the Empirical Study of the
Mind-Body Problem” (2007).

Frederic W. H. Myers (1843-1901)
Reviews and Discussions of Human
Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death
There have been many reviews of Myers’ Human Personality and Its Survival of
Bodily Death (1903). These materials are invaluable for the assessment of the reception
of Myers’ ideas, that is, how different individuals accepted, rejected, or remained neutral
about his concepts. Some of the ones available online include well-known reviews, such
as those published in 1903 by Flournoy, James, Lodge, and McDougall.
But there are many more reviews of the book that have been generally neglected. In
English these include those published in 1903 by Carus, Lang, and Riley, among others.
Robinson concluded his review in this way:
Whatever be the verdict of thought on the particular conclusions of
the author, the book is great. It is the work of a man who has tried to
scale the most commanding peaks with their untrodden snows. He has
himself passed within the veil of mist that wraps round those peaks.
His work is so obviously sincere, so interwoven with the best life of
his own soul, that one feels half-ashamed to carp and criticise, lest the
spirit of the dead author should still be responsive to the—perhaps
ignorant—voices of this world. Of him we may surely say, what he
wrote a generation back of Wordsworth: “A man who was so in accord
with Nature, so at one with the very soul of things, that there can be no
Mansion of the Universe which shall not be to him a home, no
Governor who will not accept him among his servants, and satisfy him
with love and peace” (p. 201).
There are also several reviews in French that have been rarely cited in English. Those
of Jankelevitch and De Wyzewa, published in the Revue philosophique de la France et de
l’étranger and in the Revue des deux mondes, respectively, were done using the original
English language edition. Several others were written in reference to the abridged French
edition La personnalité humaine, sa survivance, ses manifestations supranormales
(Myers, 1905). Among these were the ones authored by Ferrari, Maxwell, and Pieron.
The one written by French philosopher and psychologist Henri Delacroix appeared in
the Revue de métaphysique et de morale. In his view the “vast effort of Myers to
constitute an experimental metaphysics has failed” (p. 282). He believed this was an
illusory idea because the concept of the spirit was not one that could be explored through
facts.
One hopes that future studies of Myers will use these materials to expand the
incomplete picture we currently have of the reception of Human Personality.

“The Creed of the Spirits, and the
Influence of Spiritualism”
This 1871 lecture at Cleveland Hall, London – Sunday 30th
April,6
could be considered
one of the most important Emma Hardinge Britten lectures ever given in respect to the
founding structure of the “Spiritualists’ National Union” (S.N.U.).
Within this lecture, the basis of the Seven Principles was given. These were later to
become the foundation of the religious philosophy and conditional acceptance of
membership7
to the S.N.U.

While taking an S.N.U., advanced education course some years ago, I noted that accounts
of the origins of the Seven Principles and how they came into being, were not as the
S.N.U., claimed in relatively recent years e.g: -
The concepts and original wording of the Seven Principles came
through Emma's mediumship as she was inspired in 1871, by the
communicating spirit of Robert Owen, to summarise the philosophy of
Spiritualism in principles that all Spiritualists would agree. These
have since become know as the Seven Principles of Spiritualism.8
I earned the J.B. McIndoe (SNU award) prize for my course work, but my finding that
Robert Owen was not the inspiration of all if any of the Seven Principles as asserted by
the S.N.U., have not been accepted by them.
In May 2006 I wrote: - The S.N.U.’s Seven Principles of Spiritualism – The Error that
Changed History.9
Although now in need of some updating the historic facts remain.

“The Creed of the Spirits, and the Influence
of Spiritualism”
This page of our gospel should not be turned until many another has been read; for as we
look back over the faint and imperfect footsteps that we have made, treading on the sands
of time towards the grand culmination of wisdom and knowledge, a perfect
understanding of the gospel of the divine humanity, we see how few and faltering have
been those footsteps. But time closes around us; the darkness of the temporary hour of
separation is upon us; and in haste, like the Passover of the ancients, we must gird up the
loins of our spirits and take the last look at that bright and glorious gospel whose pages
are to be read alike in the shining stars and the many-coloured flowers. There is not a
leaf that now glitters in the parting rays of the setting sun, or bends beneath the weight of
the falling dew, but what is a chapter in that divine gospel. Each of these tiny flowers,
each tendril that supports the leaves that are tossing in the agitating breath of the strong
tempest, is a minister of God’s benevolence—an evidence of God’s wisdom and power.
But we know that when the flood-gates of Divine wisdom are opened, no hand can close
them; onward must pour the mighty flood, no matter what channels it makes—no matter
through what imperfect avenues of mortality that flood is poured. We obey thy voice O

Master of life—O Spirit of inspiration to all who, consciously and unconsciously, breathe
thy breath! Let us now contemplate this beautiful gospel, and take a brief review of its
source. A word so familiar to us now, so strange in the ears of humanity only a score of
years ago. Twenty-three years ago the views of nearly all of us that are here present
received a shock more tremendous, more powerful and radical than any that for many
past centuries agitated the mind of man. Let us recall, if we can, how vague, how
imperfect, how desolating were the best and most faithful views of spiritual existence
which any amongst us cherished. Who could determine that the form laid away in the
grave was but the casket of the brighter and more glorious man within who could not
perish? Who could determine, even if he believed that “if a man die he shall live again,”
to what unknown and distant realms that spirit was bound? Who could resolve that the
great agony of bereavement would ever again be gladdened by the great joy of reunion?
Who could resolve for himself that the efforts that he had poured out upon mankind,
sometimes so fruitlessly, so hopelessly, with so little of worldly success, should ever
meet or greet him on a further shore? What spirit was—how spirit lived, if at all—under
what conditions life was continued, if at all—(I pronounce to you with the experience of
one who earnestly and faithfully tried to discover the road)—was nothing more than a
credence in the credence of our fathers, and nothing more than a faint traditionary
belief—nothing more than a hope, or, at least an intellectual form of belief inherited by
the son from the father.
The revelations which were brought to us from the time when, twenty years ago, spirits
openly and by a series of material phenomena, demonstrated their presence amongst men
proved the identity of the workers with spirits of men that had once lived on earth—in a
great variety of circumstance flooded the world with testimony against its will—
unsought, uncourted, uninvoked. Without any of the ordinary precedents under which
humanity moves towards a great reform, Spiritualism poured itself in a mass of
irresistible power, in tides of unquenchable light, upon the unyielding yet unresisting
world. We were unyielding because we had no evidence whatsoever that there was a
power to whom we ought to yield; we were unresisting, too, for that power took us
captive, left no means of resistance. And so it becomes us from time to time, in
numbering up the footprints we have made, to recall the source, to consider the authority
that the spirits present to us, that we may better move forward either to resistance or to
obedience to this mighty and masterful control.
We first, then, recall the facts that the spirits have revealed to us. They have taught us
that the spirit of man is untouched by the action of death. They show thus that the forms
we look upon and commonly call those of humanity are nothing more than a mould in
which the inner man is forming and growing. They have taught us that there is no break
whatsoever effected in the action we call death—that the spiritual existence is an
unbroken continuity of the present. They have taught us that, in place of mere
atmosphere, ether, electricity, or other imponderable elements, this mortal world is full of
a spiritual second world, invisible to us, and only manifest through phenomenal
ministrations, or the inspiration which from time to time we receive as presentiments,
monitions, influences that we cannot repel, nor hitherto could we account for. They have
taught us that not a single act or deed, not a thought or word of our mortal existence is
172
lost. They have taught us that the true meaning of this mighty battle of life that we are all
fighting, the great warfare in which some of us are pressed down beneath the waters of
adversity until they overwhelm us—they have shown us that it is the strife of the birth of
the spirit. They have brought us face to face with the ordinary acts that we perform, and
left us no excuse for evading the responsibility that is set upon every one of us.
They have brought to our view the dawnings of a new science, the foregleams of a
grander and nobler field of knowledge than we have ever ploughed before—a field in
which stars, and world, and suns, and systems are the soldiers, and the generals, and the
mighty army of light that are moving on charged with life and spiritual existence for ever.
They have indeed enlarged the borders of our vision, independently of all the personal
blessings of reunion with our beloved, of hope and consolation for ourselves. These are
but a few of the revealments of Spiritualism; and yet there are some shadows in the
picture of the great movement which it becomes us this night candidly to reveal. Even in
this land, no less than in the far-distant homes of the mighty West, many of us who first
entered upon this glorious field, so full of promise, beheld around us the strong and the
learned, those endowed with the world’s gifts and the world’s means of strength.
Shoulder to shoulder they stood, and formed a powerful phalanx; to them, as to us, this
Spiritualism seemed to come like the Comforter, so full of joy for the present and of
promise for the future—such a leveller of those unkind distinctions which drew hard lines
of demarcation between man and man, covering the broad plain of humanity with such a
beautiful mantle of brotherhood and charity, uniting us all in a common destiny, opening
up the nature of psychology, and offering a wonderful solution of the mystery of sin and
crime, displaying the grand fields of progress before us with such unerring certainty that
it seemed impossible that a gospel so bright, so holy, so comforting, and so reasonable,
could be resisted by any.
You and I to-day stand deserted by many a one in whose hands the white standard of
Spiritualism was placed along with our own. You and I have seen the great ranks of this
army thinning. You and I could number up even in this city scores of those to whom the
mission has been entrusted who have fallen away from our side; and whilst but one
rostrum remains where the glad tidings of Spiritualism, and the keen, strict, yet daring
analysis of all that its light reveals, are permitted, we find that this rostrum is deserted by
most of those whose hands were the strongest, and to whom was entrusted the mightiest
responsibility in the conduct of this noble work. This excites in us some questions, and
the very answers that we are prepared to give most clearly elucidate the progress of the
movement. When we come keenly to analyse why we are thus deserted, we find a clue to
the character of Spiritualism throughout. Let us observe two points which account for the
defalcation of those to whom we have alluded.
Spiritualism endorses no sect; Spiritualism closes down upon all the avenues it is possible
to open of mere sectarian belief, and rebukes them all. And why? Because the very fact
of the spirit’s continued existence, its state and condition, is a denial of every sectarian
dogma. There is not one but provides a vicarious atonement for its believers. There is not
a spirit from the far East, to the mighty West, from the burning South, to the frozen
North, that has ever yet communicated to man and been able to prove that it was happy or
173
miserable on account of its belief—not one who dared to deny that its happiness or
misery is determined by its acts and deeds alone. How do we prove this? You enter any
court of justice to take human evidence, to assemble a certain number of witnesses, three
of whom shall be acknowledged as wholly unreliable—wholly untruthful; you examine
these separately, and, despite their unreliableness, they shall each separately confirm the
statements of the others; and this is evidence that no court of civilisation can reject—
evidence which for hundreds of years has been accepted in all courts of judicature.
Now, reverse the position: let your three witnesses be truthful; the fact that they shall
confirm each other is no additional weight—none at all. It is deemed by the keenest
analyst of human nature impossible that three persons separate from each other shall
represent the same circumstances exactly, unless those circumstances have a common
origin in truth, no matter whether the witnesses be reliable or not. But double the number
of witnesses—treble it—multiply it by hundreds, by thousands, by millions—remove
your witnesses to every part of the world, separate them by oceans and continents and
spaces of time that it is impossible to bridge over; and when, instead of three millions,
you have three times told three millions of persons, each testifying to the same general
points of faith. That is authority which we think we are justified in presenting to you and
it is upon such authority that we make this general statement concerning the condition of
the soul hereafter.
Now to apply this statement. The spirits, then, no matter what they preach, all confirm
each other on the practical conditions of the life hereafter. The spirits of every country,
closely questioned, will always state that they are in judgement, and that judgement is
the result of their own life, acts, and deeds. When men demand of the spirits to endorse
their peculiar views of faith—when they cannot trust their religion, cannot air it in the
sunlight, and measure it with the revelations of science which are every day confounding
and destroying it or else enlarging its borders—we find that the spirits insist upon
proclaiming this stupendous but unwelcome truth, that every spirit is in the judgement of
its own acts. We can quite understand that Spiritualism is not popular or acceptable to
the bigot. True it is that there is another solution to be given to this question, and one
that requires most careful investigation. You and I are spirits as much now as we ever
shall be. Though encased in a casket of clay, our spirits possess in germ all the attributes
that we shall ever enlarge in the grander vistas of eternity; and so, whatever influences or
powers the disembodied spirit exerts we exert also. If psychological influence is one of
the attributes of the invisible spirit, it is one of the attributes of the visible; and the strong
and determined psychology which we exercise upon the communications of the circle
constantly bends, deforms and refracts the truth that we receive.
You may say that this at once nullifies the evidence. No. When Spiritualism came to us
we had no preconceived opinions to sustain upon it; we were in the attitude of response;
we were waiting for the truth; and the voice of the spirit was then unanimous, and the
tone of spirit-communications was far more universally felt and recognised to be
unanimous than it is now. When first the spirits came among us they did proclaim this
solemn truth of which I am now speaking, and they proclaim it still, at the very time
when the sectarian, with determined psychological influence, bends, deforms and refracts
174
the communications to suit his own views. He does not know it; but one of the
revelations of this great spiritual unfoldment is to show us the power of psychology, and
the mass of self-delusion by which we are perpetually endorsing our own views at the
spirit-circle, instead of placing ourselves humbly and reverently in the attitude of
learners, recipients of the truth, not dictators of what that truth shall be. I speak
knowingly of that what I utter, for my own ears have heard men make the assertion, at
multitudes of circles of this land, that if the highest spirit of the highest spheres were to
return and deny the peculiar points of their faith, they would reject and repudiate them,
and would have no more fellowship with them.
And there is yet another cause. Spiritualism is wholly unselfish. It proclaimed from the
first the fatherhood of God—that you all admit; and with it the brotherhood of man—that
you don’t all admit. And this brotherhood was no mere myth; for the spirits of the circle
presented themselves, some from the lowest depths of poverty, and some of the highest
rounds of earthly splendour, and those had changed places. The law of caste was
annihilated and the lines of demarcation were broken down. The communications of the
spirits represented a new aristocracy. For ever throughout the ranks of humanity the
beautiful harmony of the epic of creation is to be found in inequality. Equality is a mere
myth; there is no such thing. Every human creature represents a different step on the
ladder of social, moral, intellectual, and spiritual progression; but the ladder is the ladder
for all—the ladder of which the feet of brothers are treading to reach the antechamber of
the common Father. And so the very first charge of the spirits was self-sacrifice. They
demanded some self-sacrifice in those who should bear this unpopular standard for the
sake of truth. Above all they demanded the sacrifice of those darling vices for which so
many of us have hitherto had a theological sponge, but which now stamp us with an
awful and stupendous responsibility that we cannot escape from.
Hence a great many brethren realising at first the glory, and the brightness, and the
beauty, the reunion with spiritual hosts, the marvel of spiritual communion, the great
outpouring of that which they called the world of supernaturalism, the revealments of
clairvoyance, the astonishment of the inner sight, the discovery of new and occult forces
in man and in nature, beholding only the glittering gems, but gradually finding that the
stern ethics of the spirits were beginning to descend from glittering generalities to
specialities, to personal tests and personal analysis—they have fallen away. Spiritualism
is neither a convenient religion nor an easy burden to bear before the world. No wonder,
then, that it has proved a mighty test of character; no wonder that there are but few who
now stand shoulder to shoulder where the spirits first found them; no wonder that those
who have fallen away have retreated from the “infidel spirits” because they would not
endorse their special creeds, or from the “low and vulgar spirits” because they were
levellers and did not endorse their aristocratic pretensions.
And so it is that we now begin more clearly and definitely to measure the value of
Spiritualism and its influence upon ourselves. And this hour is ours, Spiritualists. It
neither appeals to the scoffer, nor the scorner, nor the critic. We are now about to
investigate our positions, to number up our jewels, to analyse the influence that has been
exercised upon those who have dared thus far the fight, thus far borne the heat and
175
burden of the day, and who, despite the stern laws of compensation and retribution that
stare us in the face, are still Spiritualists, still dare to call ourselves friends and allies of
this mighty host that is proclaiming (I dare to assert it) a new religion. For if Spiritualism
were only the enjoyment of the hour, beautiful as it is, gladdening to the heart and
cheering to the mourner as it has proved, it were nothing but some personal attribute
which we have no right to herald forth to the world.
But Spiritualism teaches of that God who is a spirit, of that immortality which constitutes
the very gist of human existence, of that life-practice for which religious systems have
been established as a guide. What more do we require to constitute the elements of a
religion? If it be not a religion, it is nothing. What influence has it brought to you and
me? Perhaps it may seem to be but little because it has not taken the stand which any
reform that has preceded it upon earth has taken before. The scientific man looks upon it
most commonly with scorn, for reasons that we shall presently show you. He stands in
his laboratory with the instruments of his craft around him; he invites the spirits to come
and move his furniture, to practice with his instruments, to work with his particular forms
of science, and then he says he will believe. But the spirits are not there. The Press man
stands at the street corner, and echoing the voice of public opinion, repeats, with the
ribald jest, and mocking tone, the enunciations of the Spiritualists as the entire exposition
of Spiritualism. He interprets the words (every sentence being subject to interpretation
from the ludicrous or the sublime side of its meaning, whichever you please) after the
fashion that will most surely please the patrons who pay him to do their thinking, and
thus presenting Spiritualism to the world from the ribald and ludicrous aspect with which
his own nature invests it, he asks why the spirits do not come to him—why they do not
perform marvels with his pen and ink—why they do not reveal buried treasures to him.
But the spirits are not there. And the cold empty world re-echoes the demand of its old
teachers, and asks why the spirits do not come and do its work—why if they can move
one object, they cannot do everything—why, if they can discover one mystery, they do
not discover all—why, in a word, the spirits do not live their lives. But the spirits are not
there. Go to the heart which has become cold from the quenched fire of some most
precious love gone out; go to the lonely chamber, and look upon the empty cradle or the
empty chair; go to the home of suffering or sorrow—to the heart whose pride has been
disciplined, whose spirit is broken, whose worldly consolations have failed—to those
who have tried and proved the hollowness of all human institutions, and who, with
streaming eyes and breaking hearts, have uplifted their hands to the viewless I am—to the
Unknown—to the Great Spirit; and lo! At the door of the heart opened by aspirations the
angel enters, and by inspiration in a thousand methods the response comes—sometimes
in the low tap of immortals knocking tangibly at the door of the empty home—sometimes
by the low footfall, or the shadow on the wall—sometimes by the grasp of the dear hand,
and sometimes by the glittering light of the angelic form as it flashes before the eyes of
the seer—sometimes by the mystery of influx and inspiration–in ten thousand forms it
comes to the receptive, but always in the home—always to the individual—always some
special adaptation to single and individual needs.

public resort, nor appeal to leaders of public opinion; it does not subject itself to the petty
ignorance of those who in their material wisdom are wholly ignorant of psychological
laws. That is why Spiritualism comes, and that is why Spiritualism with silent tread is
taking men captive, is marching from home to home, from hearth to hearth, from land to
land—and none can arrest it, none can track its way, and none can tell how the spirits
have come. When you question again and yet again, the answer is, “The spirits are here,
but with no invocatory power of our own, by no means that we are aware of; the spirits
are here, and yet we scarcely know from whence or how they come”; and that is why
Spiritualism is an influence to individual natures, dwelling with fragments and atoms of
humanity, and not with masses.
Again its influence has been to cast us upon our special responsibility. It never does
come, never appeals to us, through the thought or influence of another. Question
yourselves, Spiritualists. Have you believed through the report of your neighbour? Is
there not a something in this mysterious power of the invisible world which compels you
to accept no less authority than the facts of spiritual existence? You have not credited
your neighbour at all. The very report that has been spread of this mighty spiritual
movement has only excited in you the ribald joke or the scornful repudiation, until the
facts have come home to yourselves. What is the meaning of this? Hitherto we have
lived beneath the influence of other men’s minds; we have paid our priests and teachers;
and statesmen, and leaders to do our thinking for us; we have stultified our own
individuality; we have willingly subjected our natures to the lead of others, and we have
determined that others should pay the penalty of our offences. It is to recall us to the
stupendous sense of our own individuality that this spiritual movement comes appealing
to our individual natures.
The world cannot understand this. The world, accustomed to see movements transpiring
only with the masses on that large scale of reform which moves humanity as a mighty
army beneath the leadership of one masterful mind, cannot understand either the extent,
or the influence, or the genius of Spiritualism. But the less we are indebted to human
influence, the more surely are we compelled to look to the true source of influence, and
the more inevitably do we find ourselves compelled to acknowledge that the source is
powerful, intelligent, benevolent, wise, irresistible. Why should we not attribute it, then,
to the beings who themselves claim to be its authors—the friends who were in our midst
but yesterday, the nearest and dearest to us by ties of kindred and sympathy?
Thus far, then, we trace up its influence and its progress upon ourselves; but we cannot
pause here. I have said that if we were to stand alone upon the evidence of these
phenomenal proofs, beautiful as they are, holy and lovely in all respects as many of them
are, they would only appeal to our individual natures—they would be nothing more than
a temporary joy or a temporary amusement. I have endeavoured, in the address I have
been privileged to offer you, to show you that whilst the spirits never exert authority on
the mind or demand of you belief, they bring you such conclusive evidences of that
which they tell, that you are compelled to acknowledge the truth whose
acknowledgement they do not demand from you. They do more—they hold up the torch
177
to the dark places of nature, and, without insisting upon their opinions concerning the
laws, principles, and origin of being, they invite to investigate for yourselves. They are
the torch-bearers without whose light those places would remain dark.
The astrologer, the geologist, the chemist, the physician, all who have undertaken to
teach us of the ways of God as manifest in his works, have never carried us beyond the
surface, never deduced us from all their sublime revelations any teachings concerning our
spiritual origin or our spiritual destiny. It is for the spirits to complement the defects of
science. The consequence is, that Spiritualism and science are at odds. Scientific men
have occupied the most humiliating position of any class towards Spiritualism, and for
this reason: with all the wealth or learning they have brought us—with all the
incalculable stores of knowledge that they have poured upon the world—with all their
industry, their learning, their devotion to the art in which they are engaged, they have
never yet attempted to transcend the mere physical existence of matter; upon the surface
of things they have groped—to the forces that move that surface alone have they
appealed, and there they have left us.
In their investigations of Spiritualism they have brought the formula of their science with
them—insisted upon subjecting the phenomena of Spiritualism to their own physical
tests; and there is no alliance between them. Spiritualism is not a physical science.
Acting through physical means, it involves a wholly new set of laws. Psychological,
spiritual, mental laws have never yet been subject to the formula of material laws. This is
a new and untrodden field and until scientific men are prepared to sit humbly and
reverently on the first step of this science they will utterly fail to procure even the very
tests that they seek. Within the last few months only, one of the most celebrated and
revered leaders of science proceeded to a spiritual circle to investigate Spiritualism with a
purpose incompatible with the conditions—he went there and made the manifestations
and simulated the phenomena which the trusting people around him believed in. He
rejoiced in making them dupes, and felicitated himself upon his deception for the sake of
exposing them. I cite this to do him no dishonour, but to show you that the very
determination, the psychological strength of will by which he approached that circle,
destroyed the manifestations; and the determination to simulate, impose upon and hold up
to ridicule the simple people whose faith had already been confirmed in Spiritualism
because they had proved it, whose faith in him was misplaced because they believed him
to be a gentleman—I say, that the very strength of purpose that made him mislead for the
sake of proving others deluders destroyed and neutralised the power that might have
made him a gentleman and taught him that he had an immortal soul.
I have said thus much, simply to illustrate the position in which Spiritualists stand. They
are deserted by the leaders of religion and science, with a few noble exceptions—a few of
those who dare to cast the priceless treasure of their soul and conscience in one scale, and
their worldly popularity in the other, and the conscience weighs so heavy that with
popularity goes up out of sight altogether. With the exception of these, the Spiritualists
are deserted by those who should be their leaders and teachers both in science and
religion—and what remains? To trust to your own fidelity, to your own sense of right, to
the God who protects you under all circumstances and never leads you into temptation
178
without offering you an open way for escape, to the Great Spirit who is your Father. To
the power that proves itself by its fruits; but I tell you now as we are closing we cannot
pause there.
The spirit lives—our own destiny is unfolded to us; our own hereafter is made clear and
plain; the way is marshalled by those we love best and those we can trust. And now we
would ask how far these beings, not as authoritative teachers, but as guides in the
direction where we are to search out a higher responsibility even than we have hitherto
assumed, the responsibility of forming our religious belief—how far can we trust them? I
shall here speak briefly of the creed which is evolved from Spiritualism. I may not now
pause on the methods of evolution. You have heard some of them in past discourses; you
may apply those to the results which I now offer.
I believe in God, for I know that spirit, matter, and motion are external
existences, co-equal, co-eternal, co-existent ever. As I believe in matter,
then so do I believe in spirit; and the totality of that spirit, that master-mind
that was even before form—that moved upon the chaos and void, and
evolved therefrom order, harmony, and form—is God. Finite as I am, I can
never comprehend his infinity; temporal pilgrim as I am now, passing on
and ever passing on in temporality, I cannot master his eternity. It is
enough for me to know that He is all wise, for the majesty, order, and
beauty of creation prove it; He is all-good, for the beneficence disclosed in
that creation proves it; He is all-powerful, for its stupendous strength, its
glorious and majestic permanence proves it.
I believe in the immortality of the human soul, for I have been taught to
analyse and search until I discover that that which is must have existed for
ever; and though on this earth I am only possessed of such memory as
carries me back to the beginning of my own temporal existence, and such
prophesy as proves to me that I shall live beyond the grave, I still recognise
that lives infinite one way cannot be finite another, and that if there is
infinity around me I am a part of it—I am infinite also. And since I
question and since I doubt, even the chemist that scoffs at me proves my
position, and shows me that nothing can be annihilated. My soul is
something, the functions of my soul are something, my self-consciousness
is something, my sense of individuality is something that can not be
annihilated. The strong psychology of another mind mightier than mine
would impose upon me the dark fatal belief of annihilation of my soul, and
eternal existence of everything else. My spirit-friend comes to my side,
grasps my hand, and whispers in my ear, in the voice of the loved and those
I have deemed as the lost—“I live for ever, and thou shalt live for ever.”
I believe in right and wrong, for I do find the penalties of the wrong and the
compensation of the right impressed on all things, on all forms of life.
When I doubt this, the sophist would come and preach to me of
circumstances, of surroundings, of impulses and forces; and when he would
179
try in the tones of sophistry to mask me from the light which the penalty is
perpetually bringing me, my spirit-friend appeals to me, and with the glory
of the immortal spheres on his glittering brow, or the darkness of the
dweller on the threshold hanging around him, gives me to understand that
the second stage of existence is absolute judgement for the deeds done in
the body.
I believe in the communion of spirits as ministering angels. I not only
realise this from the truths that are demonstrated around me, but from the
reason that assures me that the love which animated the form that I loved so
well as it still subsists must find an exercise; that to live, to love, and yet to
be unable to manifest that love to the objects that need it, must be a
condition of existence far worse than that in which we daily live, and love,
and minister to each other.
These are some of the points of my creed, and all of them I have proved. But I do not
pause here. I am living in a work-a-day world, and I am told that if my rule of life, as it
is called, is taken from me, that if my scriptures and my gospel, my creeds and my faith
are removed from me, I shall be a ship at sea without an anchor. I recall a portion of
these teachings, and I find them enunciated in the form of Ten Commandments. I recite
them, and see how far they become to me the rule of life.
The first tells me that I shall have none other God but “Me”. That word “Me” is echoed
in ten thousand clamouring voices, each one pretending to explain that “Me,” and all
differing the one from the other. I am told that I should honour my father and mother,
that my days may be long in the land which the Lord my God giveth me; when I see the
disobedient prolong their days, and the fair, the obedient, and kindly withdrawn. I am
told that I shall not kill, and that I shall commit no murder; and I see beneath the standard
of Christ, in the name of Christ, the merciful Prince of Peace and Love, of Him who
prayed for pity on his murderers, I see thousands and thousands arraying themselves
against one another in the name of Christianity, and destroying each other wholesale. I
am told I shall not steal; though I may be a wandering beggar, fluttering in rags and dying
for want of bread; but put a crown upon my head and a sceptre in my hand, and I may
steal my neighbour’s wages, and pass Acts to make my thefts legal. When my lands are
not broad enough—when my restless ambition is not content with the baubles I wear, I
may steal my neighbour’s crown and kill men to my heart’s content until I obtain what I
require.
I may not covet my neighbour’s goods. Alas! Alas! Who shall tell the hungry labourer
by the wayside not to covet? Who shall bid the poor, the oppressed, the hewers of wood
and drawers of water, not to covet? Not those, we trust, who covet their neighbour’s
lands; not those we trust who covet power—that lust for it with such mighty and
resistless ambition that they become tyrants, and autocrats, and oppressors; not those who
cause workmen by the hundred to sell their blood, their life, their time, their labour,
because that labour converts their power to work into the wealth of the capitalist. Oh
friends, we do not speak in the tone of that foolish spirit of demagogueism that would
180
level all distinctions, that would annihilate the laws which have made all men different,
place them on different steps of the ladder of creation to perform different functions. But
when we are looking to see a rule of life that will work in an order of society made up of
immense differences, let us apply that rule.
If it fail, can it be God’s law?—can it be the law of Him who in the glorious harmony of
the planetary system has not made two stars alike; and yet all move on by countless
millions in their different order, glory, size, and degree, neither jostling nor harming each
other, but all completing the grand, magnificent circuit of the skies. Can it be the law of
Him who is all-wise, and all-good, and all-powerful? We think not. And with all honour
and respect for the ancient seers and prophets, with all the deepest reverence for the
inspiration which came to them in the hour of their need, and in the time when they
required rules of life appropriate to the condition in which they lived—we ask, Are we
never to move forward to more practical issues? Are we never to have such revelations
as, without disturbing old landmarks, will explain them, add to them, and bring us to a
more practical and every-day form of religious teaching? This is what we ask.
The spirits do sometimes answer us. Within the last few hours they have given to us, not
as authority, not as displacing those old landmarks or touching them in any respect, but in
all loving kindness, to practical, working, every-day minds, such commandments as we
may all read and analyse, and apply if we choose; and the results of that application you
may judge for yourselves when you question of the spirits that have gone before. It is our
purpose to close by reading in brief the Ten Commandments of work-a-day spirits—of
those who have counted up the sands of life, and found that every grain is to be
recognised as a part of the spiritual body that constitutes the man of eternity.

Paul Gaunt adds:
In another section of the same edition of The Medium and Daybreak, we find “Mrs
Hardinge’s concluding oration” on page 144 published below is part of this: -
…………….. As a supplement to the oration, Mrs Emma Hardinge 11
electrified the audience by reading Ten “Spiritual Commandments,”
which she had written in a very rapid manner on the previous morning
under the influence of Robert Owen, whose centenary takes place next
week. They are wonderfully characteristic of that revered
philanthropist, and present perhaps the most comprehensive view of
religious ethics which the world has ever seen. On Monday morning
Mrs Hardinge presented the manuscript and copyright to Mr Burns,
with the request that he would print them for his own benefit and that
11

marrying Dr. William Britten on 11th
October 1870.
181
of the cause, and have them circulated as opportunity offered. This
kind proposal was gladly accepted, and that precious manuscript will
no doubt be long cherished as a present of the greatest value in the
estimation of its possessor. We understand these commandments will
be issued in the form of a cheap tract in a few days, and circulated far
and wide.
James Burns founder and editor of Medium and Daybreak duly accepted and published
the Ten “Spiritual Commandments.”12
It was published in J. Burns Seed Corn series13
No.5 and was entitled “THE CREED OF THE SPIRITS.”
To summarise: -
There are only two known references that I know of where Robert Owen is named as the
spirit author of the Ten “Spiritual Commandments”. Firstly, in EHB’s autobiography,14
but this account is not dated - other than that it was during the American Civil War, 1861-
1865 (probably in the earlier stages, circa 1861). An account of the séance is only
referenced that it was “………subsequently reported in the New York papers by one of the
parties present, and therefore there can be no impropriety in requoting the account….”
The second known reference is made in the above short notation from Medium and
Daybreak.
It is most interesting to note that the Ten Spiritual Commandments and the Ten Laws of
Right were later widely printed in the various journals and the Lyceum15
Golden Chain
readings (No’s 109 and 110), but always stated as being: given by the spirits or similar.
Burns in the first known printing (1871c) of the, Ten Spiritual Commandments published
after the above lecture, puts the spirit author as: “GIVEN BY THE SPIRITS THROUGH
EMMA HARDINGE”.
Since my May 2006 article16
I have found this important statement, as published below
and written by EHB as to the make up and authorship of the “Ten Spiritual
Commandments” and “Ten Laws of Right,” as in all post 1871 references to this, there is no
mention of the name Robert Owen: -

Britten later serialised this in her Two Worlds as she details below: -
THE PATH FROM MATTER TO SPIRIT
Being a clear concise guide to all that is at present of spiritual science, and the
facts, phenomena, philosophy, literature, and beliefs commonly called
MODERN SPIRITUALISM
BY EMMA HARDINGE BRITTEN
(All rights reserved.)
[NOTE.-It is now ten years since the author of the following papers was
earnestly entreated to write them for the use and guidance of the many who attended
her lectures in Australia, and yet failed to apprehend how best they could inform
themselves concerning the modes of studying out the all-important subject of
Modern Spiritualism, and its various correlations.
To meet the universal demand for such a manual, the author was persuaded to
write and publish a small work bearing the unassuming title of “On the Road.”
Several editions were rapidly called for, and as rapidly exhausted. Out of many
thousands distributed through Australasia, two copies alone remain in the author's
possession. The demand for some such plain, unadorned, but comprehensive,
manual is again renewed, and that demand is far more widely felt than the “I know
it all” Spiritualist, on the one hand, or, the “I denounce it all” opponent, on the
other, realizes.
The author’s purpose had been to republish the manual in question. Why her
intentions are altered, it is un-necessary to state in this place. Suffice it that she
gives her work as a serial to The Two Worlds, and now offers the first number to
the acceptance of all whom it may concern.-Ed. T.W.]
Below is taken from the final installment (Part VII T.W. August 17th
1888 page 20) the
original book contains 62 pages: -
“As a sample of the morality taught by those spirits who have so long
and faithfully guided the author's storm-tossed life barque, we subjoin a
reprint of the “Ten Spiritual Commandments” and “Ten Laws of Right,”
aphorisms communicated by spirits, through the author's mediumship, at
a lecture given by her in London some years since. As the lecture in
question was phonographically reported, it was subsequently printed,
183
distributed in various countries, republished and translated into many
languages, and is now offered as a specimen of the ethics and morality
enunciated from the spirit spheres.”
__________
It would be fairly safe here to suggest that EHB is refering to the Cleveland Hall, London
lecture, as she did not return to England again until 1881.17
She clearly does not attribute
the whole contents of the “Ten Spiritual Commandments” to one singular communicator
i.e., Robert Owen!
We could ask: - Why did Robert Dale Owen, who attended the first séance where his
father allegedly gave the “Ten Spiritual Commandments” and “Ten Laws of Right,” not
record this in his book. He recorded in detail other numerous séances at the same Underhill
residence of this period,18
why did the first printing of TSC (Burns 1871c) not credit Owen
as its author, why did Britten in 1878, and the Lyceum manual in 1887, etc also not credit
Robert Owen?
Emma Hardinge Britten has always been very clear that they were her creeds / principles
as movable statements open to the adaptability of change and growth; changes she
apparently adopted throughout the years. This is apparent in the above 1871 lecture when
she produces the original four creeds/principles and stated: You have heard some of them
in past discourses; you may apply those to the results which I now offer. For example in
1883 EHB’s principles numbered five, the fourth principle of this set was “Personal
Responsibility Here and Hereafter”; she had used this at a New York lecture on 12th
July
1857, she mentions ‘my own personal responsibility both here and hereafter, for all the
good or evil I have ever done on earth.’ 19
It is interesting to note that in 1857 Robert
Owen was still alive!
Despite these only tentative links with Robert Owen, the Spiritualists’ National Union are
insistent, as stated above, that: -
The concepts and original wording of the Seven Principles came
through Emma's mediumship as she was inspired in 1871, by the
communicating spirit of Robert Owen, to summarise the philosophy of
Spiritualism in principles that all Spiritualists would agree. These
have since become know as the Seven Principles of Spiritualism.

MIKE COLEMAN REMEMBERED
~~~~~~
A service of celebration for the life of Dr Michael Coleman, who died on 12 May 2009,
took place in Bedford on 2 June, led by Major Ian Loxley of the Salvation Army. After
tributes by members of the family, a soprano sang Faure’s “In Paradisum”. The SPR was
represented by David Ellis and John Randall, and the SJRC by Leslie Price.
Denise Iredell, Chairman of the SJRCT, writes:
Dr. Mike Coleman was associated with the Survival Joint Research
Committee Trust for thirty-five years and, in his characteristically
modest way, contributed enormously to our deliberations. During his
period as Chairman until he officially retired as a Trustee over ten
years ago, his sang-froid prevailed, especially when, on occasion,
there was a likelihood that some excitable members might become
over-heated! His measured, if personally non-committal, summing-
up left everyone happy.
With his vast knowledge of psychical research gleaned from what must
be one of the most extensive private libraries on the subject, Mike was
invariably patient and generous in sharing information to anyone
seeking his help. For the Trust he prepared a suggested Reading List
for Enquirers, and, although no longer an active Trustee, he was
working on updating this at the time of his death.
Everyone at the SJRCT has been saddened by the loss of a remarkably
sound investigator and, not least, a thoroughly good friend.
Mike Coleman (born 1927) was a research chemist at Unilever who was active in both
experimental and historical psychical research for over fifty years. In “Paranormal
Review” October 2002 (available on line to SPR members) he gave a personal account of
his investigations. Gradually his wide familiarity with the older literature made him
something of a specialist; though sceptical of paranormal claims he would be analytically
helpful in assessing all viewpoints.
A typical problem was that of wax moulds, where he wrote the standard survey in 1994
“Wax-moulds of 'spirit' limbs.” JSPR 59(834), 340-346, and which is still debated today (there is
believed to be a collection of such moulds at the SPR office!). He also had a thorough grasp
of the testimony problem in relation to physical mediums, and at his death was working
on a review of the new biography by Brock of Crookes.
Mike Coleman was of immense help to Psypioneer from its inception. Sometimes he
provided copies of rare material which we published. He drew attention to further puzzles
about the supposed Hydesville peddler(s) and helped clarify the publication history of
185
Mrs Britten’s Anglo-American editions. Still to come is an old Scottish case in which a
medium unwisely identified an alleged murderer and triggered legal action. Mike made
available a photocopy of the offending pamphlet, one of many rarities in his library.
Sadly, when the SPR received a large donation of Victorian Spiritualist journals in 2008,
he was among the many scholars not alerted in time; in the event, only two SPR members
are thought to have seen them. .
Mike was not on line, and received his copy of Psypioneer through the post. Quite often a
phone call would follow, drawing attention to further information, and occasionally
expressing gentle doubt about the validity of a claim. A hand written letter might then
bring more references and a photocopy from an obscure source.
We shall greatly miss our resident sceptic.

How Old Splitfoot Infiltrated Spiritualism
By Garth Willey
Sourced from the dust jacket of The Devil Within, 1979, by Marc Cramer
Original source unknown
In most modern day accounts of the events giving rise to Modern Spiritualism – in
upstate New York in the hamlet of Hydesville, in the home of the Fox family, on 31st
March, 1848 – one of the Fox sisters is attributed as having said to the source of
poltergeist type rapping noises “Do as I do, Mr Splitfoot.” Which Fox sister was it?
If you think Maggie, then you are partially right, but significantly wrong;
If you think Katie, then you are wrong, but justifiably so; and
If you think Leah, then you are partially right, but technically wrong because she wrote it
rather than said it, crediting Katie with the words but incorrectly so!
What, then, are the facts?
Mrs Margaret Fox’s signed statement dated 11th
April, 1848 for The Lewis Report20
contains the words:
20
A REPORT OF THE MYSTERIOUS NOISES, HEARD IN THE HOUSE OF MR. JOHN D. FOX, IN
HYDESVILLE, ARCADIA, WAYNE COUNTY, AUTHENTICATED BY THE CERTIFICATES, AND
CONFIRMED BY THE STATEMENTS OF THE CITIZENS OF THAT PLACE AND VICINITY.
http://www.woodlandway.org/PDF/Leslie_Price_PP12.pdf
187
“…The youngest girl21
is about 12 years old; -she is the one who made her hand go. As
fast as she made the noise with her hands or fingers, the sound was followed up in the
room. It. did not sound any different at that time, only it made the same number of noises
that the girl did. When she stopped, the sound itself stopped for a short time.
The other girl22
, who is in her 15th year, then spoke in sport and said, "Now do this just
as I do. Count one, two, three, four;" &c., striking one hand in the other at the same time.
The blows which she made were repeated as before. It appeared to answer her by
repeating every blow that she made. She only did so once. She then began to be startled;
and then I spoke and said to the noise, "Count ten," and it made ten strokes or noises.
Then I asked…”
Question: So, just who is Mr Splitfoot?
Answer: ‘Splitfoot,’ ‘Old Splitfoot’ or sometimes with facetious respect, ‘Mr Splitfoot’
was a nineteenth century New England reference to the Devil. Depicted with cloven
hooves, ‘Old Splitfoot’ probably went back to Pagan days: certainly the reference
belongs to folklore. And it is indeed a folksy name!
Question: And just how, and when, did Mr Splitfoot get into the act?
Answer: None of the literature of the time records reference to ‘Splitfoot’ until Robert
Dale Owen gave his presentation of events in Footfalls on the Boundary of Another
World in 186023
. Therein on p207, Owen wrote:
“Kate, the youngest girl, happened to remark that as often as her father
shook the window-sash the noises seemed to reply. Being a lively child,
and in a measure accustomed to what was going on, she turned to where
the noise was, snapped her fingers, and called out, ‘Here, old Splitfoot, do
as I do !’ The knocking instantly responded.”
In his research for Footfalls, Owen had visited Hydesville and interviewed the Fox family
in August 1859. In the absence of the reference to Splitfoot appearing anywhere during
the previous 11 years, it is reasonable to assume that in the course of Owen’s interview
and discussions with the Fox family, the proposition that the communicator might have
been the Devil arose. And surely, the staunch Methodist family may well have been
wondering back in March, 1848 whether or not the Devil was behind the mysterious
noises.
Owen, being a highly educated man, a Spiritualist, and well aware of the significance that
any reference to the Devil might have repercussions for Modern Spiritualism (as it was
21
Katie
22
Maggie
23
(p207, first English edition, 1861)
188
by then being called) then gave the interpretation of the events in his own words. He used
the New England folklore reference and went on to further soften the possibility of the
Devil being behind Kate’s action towards the unknown communicator as being “half in
childish jest”.
Then, in 1885, along came Ann Leah Fox Underhill’s The Missing Link in Modern
Spiritualism24
24
.
In it (pp5-10) Leah attributes her mother, Mrs Margaret Fox, as having said in her
statement of 11th
April, 1848 in the Lewis Report:
“… my youngest child said: ‘Mr Splitfoot, do as I do,’ clapping her hands.”
Now this book, The Missing Link, is well known for its inaccuracies and unreliability as
an historical record. Barbara Weisberg, in her biography Talking to the Dead25
, (p235)
describes it as “a mixed bundle of distortions and truth”.
. And states: “The tone… tends
to veer between nostalgia and bombast, but in places Leah’s account evidences a distinct
wry and even subversive wit.”
And so the fable grew. Over time, the meaning of the name ‘Splitfoot’ became lost to
Spiritualists – if, indeed, it meant anything at all to non New Englanders even in the
1800’s. It was just a folksy name in the story of the beginnings of Modern Spiritualism.

THE B.B.C. GIVES IN AT LAST
ERNEST OATEN TO BROACAST
___________
UNANIMOUS CHOICE OF CENTRAL COUNCIL
By HANNEN SWAFFER
THE B.B.C. has at last allowed a broadcast to be made by a Spiritualist!
It will take place on Friday, April 13th-orthodox folk may consider that an unlucky
day-and the speaker chosen is Ernest Oaten, who, more than any individual, represents
the movement in this country.
He has earned by long years of service what he must regard as a great distinction.
The choice of a speaker was made by the B.B.C. after consultation with the
Spiritualist Central Council, which represents all the leading Spiritualist societies of
London and the Spiritualists’ National Union, the biggest organisation of its kind in the
world.
Yes, at last the B.B.C. has consented to give our case a half-hour’s talk! It will consist
of a twenty minutes’ speech by Ernest Oaten, and then ten minutes of questioning by an
announcer and Oaten's replies. It will be broadcast from one of the provincial stations.28

In the end the broadcast was made from London, but according to BBC Archives, was not carried in all
regions.

True, Spiritualism is dumped in with Unitarianism, Theosophy and Rationalism-with
what the B.B.C. calls “religions which are not accessible for broadcasting on Sundays.”
A week ago, Frank Hawken, as secretary of the Spiritualist Central Council, was
approached by the B.B.C. which, after consultation with Sir Oliver Lodge and Dame
Edith Lyttelton, both of whom had taken part in the “Inquiry into the Unknown” series,
had chosen as a list of possible speakers Mrs. St. Clair Stobart, Mrs. Hewat McKenzie,
Miss Lind-af-Hageby, Ernest Oaten, Shaw Desmond, Ernest Hunt and myself. The
B.B.C. insisted on making the decision itself but welcomed a “suggestion.”
As the Council was meeting the next day, the matter was referred to them, and they
unanimously “suggested” Ernest Oaten.
After all, Oaten is president of the International Spiritualist Federation. He is the
Spiritualist editor with the longest experience, and he has for many years been known as
one of our chief speakers.
More than that, his practical experience of Spiritualism probably exceeds that of any
other person in the world.
The Council meeting was interrupted while Hawken called up the B.B.C., informing
them of the decision; and they, accepting it, immediately communicated with Oaten.
Ernest Oaten, who was at one time a, compositior, obtained largely his great
knowledge of Spiritualism because of the trance addresses he used to give years ago. He
asked his guide if he could be allowed to remember the utterances which passed through
his lips. This was granted.
He possesses, in consequence, such a knowledge of our case that he could argue it
with any scientist in the world, yes, or the College of Cardinals. He has spoken in
Anglican churches on the subject and at gatherings all over the country.
When, just before Conan Doyle’s passing, a deputation of Spiritualists went to the
Home Office to ask J. R. Clynes, then Home Secretary, to remove the disabilities on
mediumship, Oaten was the spokesman.
He succeeded J. J. Morse as editor of the “Two Worlds,” which was founded by
Emma Hardinge Brittain. After her passing, she told him he was going to occupy the
editorial chair of the “Two Worlds.” and, because of the spirit promise, Ernest Oaten
moved to Manchester, knowing that he would be chosen although the directors had not
then made their choice.
To this day, many of his admirable leading articles are inspired by Emma Hardinge
Brittain, the closeness of whose presence is constantly known to him.
191
During the inquiry into Spiritualism made by the “Daily Mail,” he was chosen by
that national newspaper to put the Spiritualist case. He was also chosen by the
movement to preside over the farewell luncheon given to Conan Doyle before his last
journey to South Africa.
Ernest Oaten’s conviction about Spiritualism was largely based on his long sittings
with George Spriggs, the famous materialising medium who lived at Cardiff. When a
young man, Oaten sat with him for years, and during that time saw physical phenomena
of a quailty which has not been equalled since, at least in this country.
I sincerely congratulate him upon his having been chosen. We could have no better
spokesman.
Still, I must insist that even the granting to us of this one short “talk” seems to me a
miserly action on the part of the B.B.C. which, week after week, year after year, grants
to our religious opponents complete freedom.
They are allowed to speak over the air all sorts of things which we regard as childish,
stupid and prejudiced nonsense. Chapman Cohen, editor of the “Freethinker” will no
doubt be more annoyed than we are because Spiritualism and his Rationalism are
dumped in together in the same group.
“I'm a Christadelphian,” said an Army recruit when asked his religion.
“A what?” they said. “Put him down ‘Church of England.’ No fancy religions here!”
Rationalism and Spiritualism are, in the eyes of the B.B.C., “fancy religions.”
According to the B.B.C.’s official announcement, the Rationalist, Unitarian,
Theosophilist and Spiritualist “will be questioned by an inquiring layman, who will sum
up the series in conversation with a member of the Church of England. This will, it is
hoped, increase both the interest and unity of the series.”
The “inquiring layman” is Dr. Moberly. But who is the member of the Church of
England to be? Is he to be one of the bishops who praise us, or one of the bishops who
damn us?

Ernest Oaten’s involvement in the Spiritualist movement spanned for almost 60 years.
Published below29
is an account from the earlier part of his life: -
THE PERSONAL SIDE
MR. ERNEST W. OATEN
Ernest Walter Oaten was born in Bristol, in 1875, of Nonconformist parents. He
inherited a natural ability as a public speaker from his father, who was a lay preacher and
a political orator of no mean order. His earlier education was somewhat meagre, as he
was sent to work at a printer's at the age of eleven. Leaving Bristol he soon migrated to
South Wales, becoming interested in temperance work amongst the young, and at
seventeen years of age became assistant secretary to a large Band of Hope.
Contact with psychic phenomena was made at the early age of eighteen, and young
Oaten rapidly developed a gift of trance speaking, which he exercised throughout the
country for some sixteen years.
In 1900 he moved to Portsmouth doing valuable work in re-organising the local
psychical society and also founding the Portsmouth Spiritual Temple-still following his
trade of printer. He assisted in establishing Spiritualist organisations at Southampton and
elsewhere.
Returning to Bristol, in 1905, Mr. Oaten became interested in political work, and for
many years acted as assistant registration agent there. The Spiritualist societies in the
Sheffield district appointed him resident organiser in 1909, and in 1911 he was voted a
seat on the Council of the Spiritualists' National Union, five years later becoming
president30
of that body.
In 1919 he was appointed editor of the Two Worlds,31
which journal he continues to
conduct with conspicuous ability. He is also secretary of the, Two Worlds Company, in
which office he has shewn that he possesses keen business talents.

31
Oaten was editor of the Two Worlds 1919-1945. I noted this in Psychic News 31st
March 1934: - He
succeeded J. J. Morse as editor of the “Two Worlds,” which was founded by Emma Hardinge Britten. After
her passing, she told him he was going to occupy the editorial chair of the “Two Worlds.” and, because of
the spirit promise, Ernest Oaten moved to Manchester, knowing that he would be chosen although the
directors had not then made their choice.
To this day, many of his admirable leading articles are inspired by Emma Hardinge Brittain, the
closeness of whose presence is constantly known to him.
193
In 1909 he married Miss A. Johnson, of Cardiff, a well-known and capable
clairvoyante, whose loving comradeship has been of the greatest value in his business
and his psychic work.
Not only has Mr. Oaten been successful as an inspirational speaker, clairvoyant,
healer, diagnostician and public orator, but he has also gained the love and respect many
thousands who recognise in him a man of unswerving honesty, deep sincerity and
profound common sense. He claims, with justification, that the deficiencies of his early
education have been more than compensated by the training that he has received in
contact with the spirit world. As a speaker, in the cause of psychic truth, he is in the
forefront of the movement and has addressed large meetings all over the country. He has
conducted numerous experiments in telepathy, and experienced travel in the spirit world,
in fact, there are few Psychic experiences that have not come his way. He maintains that
the bulwark of his psychic life is the home circle.
It is perhaps scarcely necessary to recall that at the International Congress of,
Spiritualists, in London, last year, Mr. Oaten was unanimously elected president of the
International Federation of Spiritualists which important office he still holds.
_____________
In 1938 Oaten published “That Reminds Me.”32
an insightful little book documenting
some of his many experiences. A suggestion by friends to record some of his experiences
started in a series of weekly articles in The Two Worlds. These proved so successful he
published them in one volume. Oaten states in the Foreword: - Some of them are outstand-
ing memories, which have influenced my life and conduct. Many of them have been written up
from notes made at the time, and during their publication I had scores of letters from old
friends who were present when they occurred, and who have been able to confirm my
statements.
I have just noted that the S.N.U. Lyceum has re-printed this rare book.33
From the book
and printed below, is one of Oaten’s experiences with his old friend Sir Arthur: -
MEMORIES OF DOYLE
OF the many memories associated with my forty five years of Spiritualistic work, some of
the happiest are those that surrounded my close association with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He
was probably the biggest man I have met on this earth. In stature he was no pigmy, but in
breadth of heart and mentalty, in depth of sympathy and understanding of men, I have not

met his equal. When, after twenty years’ investigation, he decided to tell the world his
cherished convictions, I was privileged to be called upon by him to arrange his tours through
the Provinces.
One week-end I had him at Leeds, where we had a tremendous fight. The Leeds
Corporation refused to let the Town Hall for a Spiritualistic meeting. I visited Leeds, got
together a few of the local friends who were ratepayers, interviewed the chairman of the
Watch Committee and two or three other of the Corporation members and officials. I told
them that the Town Hall was the property of the ratepayers, and all ratepayers should have
equal right to its use. After a tremendous fight, which lasted a fortnight, they gave way, and
the meeting held on the Sunday night was a tremendous success. But few people knew the
heavy heart with which Sir Arthur ascended the platform. A few hours before the meeting he
had received a wire that his son Kingsley was nearing the end of his physical life, and the
call came to return to London immediately. He showed me the wire, and said, “What am I to
do?” I said, “Well, I will offer the meeting an apology, and take it myself and explain to them
the circumstances.” He said, “No; I must not break faith with the public. It is my duty to fulfil
my obligation to them. I will take the meeting.”
The following day we journeyed to Nottingham for a meeting in the Mechanics’ Hall. In
the late afternoon, an hour before the meeting, came the wire that Kingsley had passed
through the little white gate which leads into a larger life. There was a big bond between
Kingsley and his father, and I could see that he was hit very hard, but as we went across to
the hall he said, “Not a word about what has happened. I must carry this burden alone. Don't
tell the people.” Hundreds were turned away from the hall that night. There was a good deal
of confusion at our inability to find seats for everybody.
For an hour he addressed the audience, winning all hearts by his plain, straightforward
matter-of-fact testimony to the truth of survival and communication, the biggest and surest
conviction in his life. In closing the meeting, I took the liberty of telling the audience the
strain under which Sir Arthur had been working. They rose and cheered, but two big tears
rolled down his cheek. He journeyed to London immediately after the meeting.
To Sir Arthur the public were a sacred tribunal, and personal desires and considerations
had always to be subordinate to that. I often admired his joyous boyish nature when things
were going well, but to see him in a crisis such as I have described was to realise the great-
heartedness of a great man.
