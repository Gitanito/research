good afternoon dr greer
hey pat how are you good good glad to
see you good to see you guys i know you
wanted to uh we wanted to kind of get
together and talk about some of the
upcoming events that you have going on
um interesting things so would you like
to tell us a little bit about that
yes it&#39;s really exciting we&#39;re going to
be out at doing ce5 contact in the
desert of arizona in uh september
uh the 16th 17th 18th that weekend
and uh on that sunday night the 18th
we&#39;re going to be out in the desert on
native american sacred land under the
stars
and so people can join us in person or
by webinar
and we want to do a mass ce5
contact meditation uh each night the
first two nights friday and saturday
will be inside uh but we have the use of
the native lands on that sunday night
and the reason we want to do that is
because it creates
this huge shift in consciousness when
you have thousands of people online and
in person
doing this meditation you know we did
that last april
we had uh craft that came over we had
objects that came in the field
many it was mass witness events and so
it&#39;s very exciting and i&#39;m hoping that
you know we&#39;ll we&#39;ll do this on a
regular basis you know two or three
times a year uh in in person but also by
my webinar
so
this this is the sort of experience that
people have
when you know you look at the studies in
consciousness where
one percent of a population
begins to do something in consciousness
and meditation it shifts the other 99 in
a very positive way
so our goal globally would be to have 75
million people at some point but this is
how it starts and so we&#39;re hoping that
we&#39;ll be able to pull in
a lot of people online and in person
um you know the site only holds a few
hundred people but the online we can
have an infinite number of people
technically so that&#39;s what we&#39;re going
to going to be doing and they&#39;re in the
day
when we&#39;re not doing this at night
i&#39;m going to do more uh
in depth than last time on techniques
for remote viewing where i will be
teaching meditation techniques
one that&#39;s more vedic sanskrit mantra
and the others that are breathing
techniques
for
being in a higher state of consciousness
and then the techniques from there
how you begin to be able to see remote
places and do the ce5 contact protocols
so that&#39;s going to be a big part of the
project
uh during the afternoons and i&#39;m also
going to do a big update
on official us government disclosure and
and what&#39;s happening in washington that
you will not hear in the news or see on
the internet um then i think it&#39;s very
important because as i&#39;ve mentioned the
biggest events
um and progress that i&#39;ve seen in 32
years are currently happening
and so it&#39;s a very big
uh
movement forward that&#39;s why i put on my
2001
disclosure project
it&#39;s a rag virtually a
polo shirt from the original disclosure
project
so that&#39;s uh that&#39;s
you might want to get more of those made
i know i dredged it up and it&#39;s uh it&#39;s
it was it was only one that was made for
me and
it&#39;s got a few holes in it
but anyone who knows me knows i honestly
don&#39;t care about clothing but uh the
interesting or anything else for that
matter in the material world but i think
that this uh experience out in arizona
we&#39;re going to be way east of phoenix
east of scottsdale
um at a native american
hotel
and during the day but then this night
event is on this beautiful setting it&#39;s
just a stunning setting way out dark out
on the edge of of the city
um
adjacent to
uh thousands of acres of native american
uh sacred land but also tonto national
forest which i think is something like 5
million acres so that&#39;s going to be a
really great
thing for people to come to in person if
you can get there
and um
it&#39;s a great experience for people
and
one of the other things we&#39;re going to
be adding to this weekend intensive i
consider these a weekend intensive
training
uh for friday night saturday sunday
september 16 17 18
is a really deeper dive into
the higher states of consciousness and
the experience of those
and how you can develop those and do
your ce5 contact teams
now in the mornings um because i&#39;m not a
morning person i normally go to bed at 4
a.m and get up at noon something like
that
you&#39;re we&#39;re gonna have uh
presentations uh that you&#39;ll be helping
with
on setting up
your own local ce5 team and then also
justice cam will be helping with that
and we&#39;re going to have sessions also on
um doing trans-dimensional photography
now people go what does that mean
well if you look at the pictures we have
of the e.t from andromeda that came to
joshua tree
bijou
there was a very specific way that
happened and the way it unfolded and get
into
same thing with the e.t healer that
healed the man of his hearing loss in
oracle uh we&#39;re actually going to be
going uh before this event in arizona
in arizona uh
up in the mountains above tucson
and
the photography isn&#39;t just take a
picture uh it&#39;s specific settings of a
camera
certain exposures
shutter open links
but also a conscious component
because what&#39;s interesting is that when
we&#39;re sitting in circle under the stars
doing this
there&#39;s all kinds of interstellar
phenomenon happening
and not all of it&#39;s 3d some of it just
partially comes into this dimension and
vanishes
for a number of reasons including their
own safety
and security
but
um what we found is like when our friend
raven took
the picture
of bijou at joshua tree
she actually connected to the being
because we heard a group of the e.t
speaking about
three feet outside our circle
and asked permission but was making a
conscious connection with him
and he turned and waved her and she and
appeared in the in the uh
picture just as she took the picture so
there&#39;s this sort of conscious
interactive component to it because
interstellar civilizations
the big secret that no one at the cia
wants to talk about
is that their technologies are all
interfacing with consciousness thought
and higher dimensional fields
so
to be a ce5
ambassador where we initiate contact
you really gotta a understand that which
is what we&#39;ll be doing very much at this
three-day event in arizona
but and then capture and document it
you have to also know the principles of
the physics
of going from
one point in space you say you know
andromeda galaxy which is where bijou is
from
it&#39;s two and a half million light years
away we&#39;re not going to travel to speed
of light
you know it would take you two and a
half million years
so you&#39;re going to be going through
other dimensions at resonant frequencies
beyond 3d
beyond the speed of electrons atoms
light
which means you&#39;re going through other
dimensions which are increasingly
conscious dimensions
and dimensions of thought and
consciousness
and then you&#39;re going to re-emerge into
the space around
this weak oppah resort in arizona
for example on september 16
17 18. now when they come in
they step down from a higher frequency
dimension into 3d
at that instant there&#39;s all kinds of
phenomena that happens now
in full disclosure and honesty
i&#39;m 10 thumbs with a camera so i don&#39;t
operate
so i&#39;m the people who have expertise in
the camera were
would be you know marcel uh and uh
justice and some other folks who who do
this and actually know what they&#39;re
doing
with you know really good cameras that
you have now that you can do digital
work with
that are extremely sensitive
we&#39;re also planning to have at this
event we hope a 360
high-resolution camera so things that
happen out on the native american land
will be able to capture and this is
something i&#39;ve been wanting to develop
for
20 years and now we have someone who who
thinks they may have gotten this
nailed down
so that would be very exciting
and um
and so those are going to be some of the
you know highlights but we&#39;re going to
go through
an intensive training and meditation
remote viewing
ce5 contact protocols i will do an
update also on
what&#39;s happening in washington
because it&#39;s very historic and it&#39;s not
at the point now where it&#39;s covered in
the media or on the internet
but
because of the folks i&#39;m working with i
know exactly what&#39;s happening
and we&#39;re providing the intelligence to
them so that they&#39;ve gotten inside these
uh
corrupt illegal projects
and now they have dozens of people
coming forward as whistleblowers but
this is a very big development it&#39;s very
dangerous frankly
but it&#39;s very very exciting and i&#39;m sure
in another month and a half there&#39;ll be
even further developments than what i&#39;ll
be covering here today although i do
want to get into that
and the other thing about
this three-day intensive is that people
who come to that can then begin to be
put into
a system where if they want to come for
a whole week
um
one of these small events where we only
have 20 people or 30 people
um out in the desert with me but
i want to have people have a certain
level of knowledge and experience before
they do that so that it&#39;s a richer and
more
meaningful experience for everyone who
comes so that&#39;s another reason why we
want people to start attending these
three day events
and um
so that&#39;s going to be very exciting and
i think what people are going to enjoy
about this is the
uh ability also we&#39;re hoping to organize
a means uh we have to get our volunteers
we have about 25 volunteers coming to
organize it so that people who come
will be able to at certain times maybe
lunches because we&#39;re going to provide
lunch for people on saturday and sunday
be in areas of the united states or a
state
like we have a convention you know like
a
you hold up you know arizona or
california or new york or whatever
so that people who are in their region
they can meet with network with to form
ce5
local or regional teams that&#39;s a great
idea yeah because this is what of course
you guys have been doing in texas
and i&#39;ve trained you know people every
month you know sometimes 50 or 100
people
who come uh obviously that&#39;s great
because i can&#39;t be you know everywhere
so that&#39;s that&#39;s a really good
networking opportunity at a a convention
a conference like this
lots of people have asked about that
like how can we can how can we meet
other people there&#39;s some this is good
that we&#39;re doing this this is great this
one
yeah we probably need to get a bunch of
like sticks with uh something on it
where you can just put your state or
if you&#39;re from england or wherever and
put it and see who comes over
um because i think that&#39;s
for people who want to do it with a
group um everybody wants to i mean some
people do this just with their friends
or family
but i think there&#39;s a real power in in
uh developing a network locally
and uh
to that on that note also
uh the
we have a announcement we have just
finished the renovations on the star
retreat center in hot springs virginia
and of course pat you&#39;ll be there in a
couple of weeks with a few of the rest
of us
um so at some point in the near future
we will be announcing how people can
sign up to use
that
10 bit it&#39;s got 10 bedrooms and sleeps
22 people
and
on its own five acres but surrounded by
several hundred acres and it&#39;s about
five minutes from
about 685 acres we got that we haven&#39;t
yet cleared to get up on but we hope to
eventually get a path up to the top of
that land cleared because it&#39;s
surrounded by
i think 1.8 million acres of national
forests but that retreat center is just
gorgeous
and it&#39;s an old 1907 victorian house
great energy beautiful views and um so
people who have their own local team for
example
you know say if there&#39;s a team that
wants to meet some place where they all
gather for a week or weekend
they can uh then get it and and by the
way uh
thank you pat&#39;s agreed to coordinate you
know those teams with using that um
retreat center nice
happy to help
yeah it&#39;s great help
yeah i think there will be a lot of
groups this is always one of the things
that people look for is when they get a
group together
is um you know it can be problematic is
if they&#39;re university you have too much
light pollution but this place would be
perfect oh it&#39;s so dark and and remote
but you can get to them you can fly into
uh dulles airport dc and be there in
three hours
or into um
charlottesville virginia or shenandoah
airport or roanoke virginia and be there
in an hour and a half
so um and about an hour from the
west virginia airport where uh like
sulphur spring the the green briar is
uh in in lewis county so there are
airports you can fly into that are
anywhere from an hour to an hour and a
half and and if you want non-stop three
hours away so you could go in and do
that or drive if you&#39;re in a regional
like from atlanta north carolina dc
pennsylvania
ohio um that part of the united states
so even michigan so it&#39;s an eight-hour
drive but you know people will do it if
they&#39;re going to be there for a while
and it&#39;s nice because each bedroom has
its own um
hvc air conditioning heat controls
um there are
dining for 22 people inside and about
that number outside
and
of course people are responsible for
their meals i mean it&#39;s just the place
but
it&#39;s all beautiful and
seven of the bedrooms have their own
bath in suite and then the third floor
has three bedrooms and a bath and a half
that would be shared in its own living
room living quarters
i think those were this
very politically incorrect but i think
in 1907 those were the servants quarters
that we&#39;ve now renovated into really
nice space for people
and it has two living rooms and two
dining areas and um
so
we&#39;ll have bluetooth speakers and we
have 31 of those anti-gravity chairs so
that
so if people want to come they don&#39;t
have to bring their own chairs and stuff
that you know recline where you&#39;re just
very comfortable out under the stars
so that&#39;s that&#39;ll be there for anyone to
use also uh in the garage i think that&#39;s
great because there are i i know a lot
of groups that would would use this as a
trip a ce5 trip yeah it&#39;s very bonding
after a week yeah people would show up
for that because it&#39;s a great property
you know it&#39;s dark out there what could
be better really
well and also just as a spiritual
retreat for a group of people to spend
time meditating away from the world
there are you know very good restaurants
in the area you have the omni homestead
resort is a billion dollar resort
six minutes away
um and it&#39;s beautiful lots of national
forests and lakes are there&#39;s a a 2 500
acre lake about 25 minutes away and
another beautiful state park lake about
30 minutes away
beautiful places to go out and do ce5
and uh or on the property but
i think that that&#39;s a really great
thing we&#39;ve been wanting to develop
so that people have a place to go as a
team
and develop team cohesion coherence
deepen their meditation
and all that so we designed it so it had
that so people would have you know their
private spaces
there are multiple places even for small
group meditations and in the main level
but then on the second floor there&#39;s a
second floor porch
and a second floor sitting area for
private meditation and small groups
so it&#39;s it&#39;s got a lot of
we designed it so that people would have
you know breakout areas like that if
they had a larger group
and
and the bonus is that it is your place
yeah well it&#39;s it&#39;s the in five retreats
yeah yeah yeah
when we go there uh in two weeks or so
we&#39;re we&#39;re doing this whole christening
thing there and it&#39;s wonderful
yeah we&#39;re gonna do the the sanskrit
puja and the meditation and
um
we might have fun naming the rooms i
think one of them should be the bijou
room
i think each bedroom should have a
little uh it should be the plaque and by
the way i want to thank everyone who
sent art
as you go through this house um i think
maybe in a couple weeks we&#39;ll do a
youtube from there just to show
everybody there&#39;s gorgeous art that was
donated and a beautiful set of mandalas
that someone gave
and beautiful objects and things so
thank you to everyone who sent those
objects in to put around and make it
beautiful because
it&#39;s 7 500 square feet so it was a lot
to furnish it and make it look nice and
so it wasn&#39;t just an empty place you
know
yeah we did it two and a half you know
we from the time we got it to now it&#39;s
two and a half months and it&#39;s now ready
to go
yeah i think doing a zoom from there
doing an interview from there and walk
through would be fabulous and just even
the views
you sent me a picture recently of
the double rainbow i was like oh my gosh
look at that beautiful beautiful photo
yeah that&#39;s right across that&#39;s uh right
across from the valley from
from the property and that&#39;s an 11 000
acre conservation easement
where that happened and so and the farm
around us is about almost 500 acres
and uh
you know it&#39;s set way up off the road
there&#39;s a road that goes through the
valley and it&#39;s set above and off there
um and
you know i think it&#39;s a really beautiful
area
now we do get more clouds and rain here
than you than the the desert of arizona
but you just have to plan for that but
the nice thing is there&#39;s one of these
gigantic old southern porches with
corinthian columns where you could have
your whole group if it was starting to
rain and then and you could be there and
then you could go out on the grounds of
it cleared up so you know it&#39;s kind of
nice because it&#39;s in one of these 14
foot high ceiling
old
porches that was you know the classic
big southern porch
yeah i saw that fabulous screen door and
i thought i haven&#39;t seen a screen door
like that for 50 years
oh yeah no it&#39;s all been really
beautifully uh reserved preserved and
renovated
right and then and then we added
we doubled the number of bathrooms so
that each
on the first two floors every bedroom
has its own ensuite bath
and temperature controls
wow
yeah
so very cool
yes so it&#39;s exciting it&#39;s a lot of work
but
you know um and when we were talking
about this expedition that&#39;s um that
we&#39;re doing the week before
somebody brought up on discord they said
you know this will be great you&#39;re out
on there or six nights out there
and uh you can let them know about the
thing at wicopa
exactly yes
so yeah the big three-day event that you
guys are being invited to
um will sort of warm up the area by
being about an hour and a half two hours
away up in the mountains above tucson
for a week with a small smaller group
um and uh
so i think that&#39;s exciting and just you
know if people could spread the word to
other groups and let them know we&#39;re
doing that and if they can&#39;t be there
in person then they can be there um you
know virtually through the webinar
right i think it&#39;ll be fun we had a
great time last time everybody that
had a great time
things that happened out there that
sunday night under the stars
everybody was like holy cow that
that was amazing what happened
yeah it is and
i think it&#39;s very powerful for the earth
and humanity when there&#39;s a group of
people doing that with this purpose of
transforming
uh the direction where we&#39;re headed
uh which is very disastrous into a very
positive direction and that all happens
first in
consciousness and the higher someone&#39;s
state of consciousness is
the more powerful
the change happens but they&#39;ve done
studies like that dr john
at the princeton engineering anomalies
research lab the peer lab at princeton
university
he was an engineering professor
and they found that with like random
number generators these quantum random
generators that if you
uh had one person putting their
awareness on it and
intending
in consciousness for the random number
generator to shoot out more ones and
zeros
it would but if there were two people
that were united or loved each other it
was an exponential effect so imagine
when you have coherence with hundreds of
people
there
and thousands of people online
doing it all together
and this is what these these advanced
civilizations are looking for they&#39;re
looking for the earth and humans to
transition
to a an awake enlightened peaceful
civilization that will approach
space outer space
by first having
mastered inner space
higher consciousness so everybody wants
to go out in space before we&#39;ve
done the work in here in our hearts and
minds and souls and that is really a
very important point it&#39;s the reason why
these ets have such concern
since the 40s when we started detonating
hydrogen bombs atomic bombs
which tears the fabric of the cosmos
sends out electromagnetic pulses that
are beyond the speed of light
disrupts interstellar communication and
travel that&#39;s why after the atomic bomb
that&#39;s why all these
ufo events started happening
around all our uh nuclear facilities and
the roswell event people forget the
roswell base the roswell army air base
was the only place on earth in 1947 that
had operational atomic bombs
no people do forget that completely yeah
and they said so it wasn&#39;t by some
accident
that that happened they were they were
down by electromagnetic directional
energy weapons primitive ones for 1947
compared to what we have now but
that was not a coincidence and
similarly all through of the history
since the 40s to now not only here but
the soviet union russia china france
england uh nuclear armed ships on the
ocean
uh in fact i just heard from a navy guy
who was on a nuclear armed
ship that that had a ep visitation
because of their concern
about these weapons
now of course right the the spin
meisters
in the intelligence community and and
the ufo community have spun that as an
invasion from the aliens and a threat to
our national security
that&#39;s not true i mean obviously if they
wanted to turn all those systems off
they turn them off tomorrow
uh it&#39;s because they&#39;re concerned about
us being out of control and violent to
the point that we could store and
destroy earth
but also
we could be we are a threat to other
worlds out there at this point with the
technologies we have that are beyond the
speed of light
you know it&#39;s ben rich who is the head
of the lockheed skunk work said
we already have the means
to take e.t home quote unquote
he said that
so and he knew what he was talking about
all right that was quite a while ago
yeah that was in the uh
80s or 90s yeah
at least 30 years
now
oh yeah yeah so order i mean because you
have an exponential development of
technologies as you know with each
decade
and you figure well trillions of dollars
in black beyond black budget
funding
and some of the brightest minds in the
world that they recruit out of high
school and college working on these
systems
you you have some serious payoffs
unfortunately they&#39;re in the hands of
the worst criminal enterprise the earth
has ever seen and those are the folks
keeping this secret
um which means even more that we so let
me frame this in another way about what
we&#39;re doing now in arizona september
16th 18th
17th 18th
there has to be another
uh countervailing force that&#39;s positive
yes a another type of energy
coming from humans
besides all this fear-mongering
and saber-rattling and uh taking
everything
as a paranoid military threat and these
civilizations have been waiting i i
actually say they&#39;ve been knocking on
our front door back door basement door
for you know 80 years
since the 40s
uh waiting for humans to answer properly
but the u.n isn&#39;t doing this the foreign
ministries aren&#39;t the state department
isn&#39;t
so that&#39;s why a private
group
a public group that but private in a
sense it&#39;s not part of any government
is so important a non-governmental
organization which is what we are
because that is exactly how
change happens in the world
and by doing it when you understand the
multiplier effect of a group of people
in meditation and coherence
i know that last time we did this in
arizona in april
at the
native uh american facility
there was those meditations in the
evenings there was such coherence and
silence and you know you could everyone
could feel the effect that was having
only that&#39;s where we were but beyond
because remember the conscious field
isn&#39;t limited by space and time it
affects everything
that&#39;s the power of non-locality as it&#39;s
called or entanglement and so
you know understanding those principles
which will go into a great deal over the
course of the weekend and then
practicing them
that&#39;s what we want people to leave with
that experience
yeah that friday night i i was literally
shocked
i was that friday night because from 8
to 10
we did an early you did an earlier
session um but that night was we came
back to do this evening session where we
did a puja we did the whole puja and
then you led a meditation
and i thought well this will be
interesting to see how people who who
really have never done this before
you know are they going to be able to
kind of follow along and kind of be
still and how will this work i i was
absolutely
everybody we were all looking at each
other like oh my god this is amazing you
could have heard a pin drop
i know i don&#39;t remember 600 people in
there so i don&#39;t even know how many
hundreds and hundreds there were
literally you could have heard a pin
drop in there the the coherence and the
energy that that the energy that
emanated from that group meditation was
you know
amazing to me yeah it was beautiful and
i think everyone felt that and so many
people commented on it so but but that&#39;s
going to be picked up
by the civilizations from other star
systems right because their technologies
and their awareness
are not looking through
the web telescope i mean their
their technologies are beyond the speed
of light beyond uh
just 3d dimension right
three dimensions and so
you know that&#39;s going to be sensed and
known and it actually resonates and it
actually then
attracts these civilizations to interact
with a group that&#39;s peaceful coherent
enlightened
and are safe
because a group like that is not giving
off the energy of fear and violence
right no they&#39;re giving off the
intention
of friendly uh peaceful
contact this is why when people say oh
you&#39;re gonna do a sky watch i go no no
no no
we&#39;re not this is way beyond going out
just looking at the sky
this is actively becoming part of the
cosmic mind
and then doing it specific
and of course what i recommend also to
people listening is to get the ce5
contact app
it&#39;s actually right now number four in
the world on educational apps on the
itunes store app store
and
because that has an entire training
program so if you go through that before
you come in september
then you&#39;re going to be much more
prepared and more powerful you will be a
more powerful ambassador we call that
whole program ambassadors to the
universe that we&#39;re citizen ambassadors
from earth
this is what i want like training people
to
think of themselves this way
as
the sort of liaison
and emissaries from the earth and peace
to these other civilizations all of them
and that has a very powerful effect
because honestly until we founded the
ce5
contact
movement in 1990 nobody was doing that
on a global scale
so i think it&#39;s really important that
the etc humans
finally
after all these years doing something
meaningful and enlightened
now switching switching you know a
little bit to another issue here
um i&#39;ve been spending every uh
every week i&#39;ve been going into
washington d.c and having taking
meetings and
i have some very important news
there are
both a senate and a house bill
that will be part of the defense
authorization act that goes through this
fall
that provides explicit
specific
whistleblower and protection and release
or a vehicle for
witnesses who in the military or
contracting world or intelligence
world who&#39;ve been involved in these
covert
ufo
programs
to legally
share their information
now we sent out
something about that and as a result a
very senior
air force
officer
now retired contacted me
who has some very
in-depth knowledge and involvement with
this
and he said he&#39;s been watching what
we&#39;ve been doing with the disclosure
project for 20 years
and has kept his powder dry until we
were able to get this
move through
and that&#39;s going to go through in
another month or two a couple months so
this is extremely good news but it&#39;s
important that all of us share this
youtube
a link because you never know who&#39;s out
there who&#39;s been following this waiting
for this moment
right now remember the presidents and
the ci directors and these sort of
people i briefed in the past didn&#39;t want
to go this far
the folks who are running the
investigation inside the government now
do and they are going this far
so this is a game changer in 32 years of
doing this and as
the founder of the global disclosure
project movement i&#39;ve never seen
anything like this in terms of its
potential
there&#39;s a there&#39;s a doors open and we
better move through that door because it
could slam shut again
so i encourage people to share this
information
with everyone they know you never know
who
is in your network of friends family
work associates who are in fact
people who have had some involvement
with this issue who have been sitting on
the fence
or waiting for a safe
vehicle a safe way
to move their their knowledge forward
and to end
the criminal programs keeping the secret
by the way 99 of everyone involved in
those projects don&#39;t know that they&#39;re
being run illegally
they don&#39;t
no they have no idea only the very top
echelon
so let me explain something to folks
most people are sort of cogs in a very
big machine
in these beyond black unacknowledged
special access projects
because
most of them don&#39;t know
what i learned in 1993 when i briefed
the director of the cia
and that is that
beginning in 1956 or so
the u.s the constitutional government of
the united states was decapitated
president
senior folks
were actually being deceived and moved
out of an organization
that irrigated to itself
the right to work on this issue but not
inform the constitutional leaders
in the white house or the congress
so those projects went completely rogue
let&#39;s say
in the late 50s this is why eisenhower
in 1961 when he left office said beware
the military industrial complex now
the very good news is that they&#39;re
extremely senior people now in the u.s
government that we&#39;ve given actionable
intelligence to who now know that that
is true
and not some
you know
subculture conspiracy theory nonsense so
they know for a fact it&#39;s true but the
implications of it
obviously are there are people who have
worked for a period of time or
episodically or maybe they were had an
incidental event that they saw
they don&#39;t know that these projects you
know they were told keep this secret
sign this 70-year non-disclosure
agreement and they thought they were
signing on to a legally
sanctioned
even if it was a black project a legally
sanctioned black project right
now i have been meeting with people who
manage the black budget of the united
states who denied access to these
projects
that&#39;s more proof
of what i said in the 90s after briefing
the ci director and after a brief the
head of intelligence for the joint
chiefs of staff admiral wilson and the
head of the defense intelligence agency
on and on and on and members of the
senate intelligence committee even in
the 90s they all said look we know
nothing about this
so there&#39;s no way those projects are
being run legally if the president the
ci director the secretary of defense the
people in charge of the pentagon at that
level
can&#39;t get access to and are threatened
admiral wisland admitted he was
threatened
with the motion and he told me worse if
he kept pushing on it
there&#39;s a former member of congress who
at the time was a member of congress
that i briefed i found out about a month
ago two months ago
that a couple of guys showed up and
threatened to kill him and his family if
he pursued this any further
now
that&#39;s another reason why we&#39;re putting
this in place to also protect
to get a protection for these
whistleblowers so we&#39;re not only
providing people who have
their non-disclosure agreements and
security oaths
uh whistleblower protection as well as a
mechanism around those
and often cases they literally signed
70-year secrecy agreements but we&#39;re
also
providing a mechanism for them to be
protected
uh physically
and eventually financially as well if
that&#39;s in play
so i think this is why whether you&#39;re on
the corporate side of it with a
contractor or military or intelligence
or other government agency you need to
contact us at
seriousdisclosure.com s-i-r-i-u-s
disclosure.com and there is actually a
box on the contact bar for witnesses
military corporate witnesses
um it&#39;s very important because this is a
very very big development
and the support is now there and there&#39;s
a mechanism there
and it has to happen i think pretty
efficiently in the next year or so
because i don&#39;t know that the window is
going to be open for much longer than
that so i think you know time is of the
essence
yeah i think so and that&#39;s huge news i
mean that&#39;s that&#39;s so
much different than what it&#39;s been in
the past oh yeah there&#39;s nothing like it
i i mean i&#39;m in dc every week and have
been
for decades and and i&#39;ve never you know
this is by far the most promising
um
movement forward and by the way it&#39;s
totally separate from that office at the
pentagon or you know that sir dog and
pony so clueless
open hearings that happened a couple
months ago that were
frankly a charade
because the guys who were there
testifying didn&#39;t even know what the
maelstrom nuclear strategic air command
nuclear case was
which is of course multiple disclosure
project witnesses and and official us
government documents that we published
in 2001
okay a 20 year 21 years ago so you&#39;re
dealing with people who are where it&#39;s
really just sort of a
storefront
but there&#39;s another thing going on what
i&#39;m trying to tell people without saying
what i cannot go into details on
is that there&#39;s something else going on
that&#39;s very profound and very effective
and i&#39;m sure they wonder how you know
all this stuff
well
look it&#39;s it&#39;s 32 years of hard work and
over you know a thousand or more top
secret guys
who give me information documents
facilities project code names
the locations of underground work areas
on and on and on and on and i&#39;m
conveying all of that
to these people every shred of it
it&#39;s a process yeah we&#39;re in the process
of
of getting my archive properly digitally
scanned and organized
so that it can be put into a massive
archive
for these folks
someday maybe we&#39;ll make it available to
the public if we had enough well again
we&#39;re doing this with all volunteers so
but it&#39;s um you know i&#39;ve told them i
don&#39;t want any official
u.s government supporter funding i want
to stay fiercely independent which i&#39;ve
always been
yeah
so it&#39;s so not washington because
everyone has their hand out
um but i said yeah
those things come with very big strings
and ropes that tie you up no thank you
i&#39;m fierce as you know pat i&#39;m fiercely
independent i will not be corrupted
um you know i walked away from the head
of
general stubblebine offered me two
billion dollars he was the head of army
and intelligence and the special forces
in 1992 they offered me personally two
billion dollars to betray what we&#39;re
doing i said no thank you
so i think that this is something that
people have to understand the kinds of
threats
that are scary
and bribes that are substantial
that have corrupted this process since
the late 1950s
lethal force has been used and a lot of
money you know remember i met with a
member of this
committee that runs these covert
programs
in 1993 prior to briefing the director
of the cia
where
he said we have paid at least
10 000 people
10 million dollars each or more
to secure their cooperation with what
we&#39;re doing
and that he offered me another kind of
bribe
so i think that that&#39;s real it&#39;s
outrageous um
but look a lot of people for that kind
of money will say oh yeah sure great you
know they&#39;d sell their grandmother under
the bus for that
or if they&#39;re threatened you know i mean
this is why i tell people the currency
that matters
in this
is integrity
honesty courage
except perseverance
the these these people i&#39;m working with
in dc they have all that we&#39;ve gone
round and round so they&#39;re going the
distance and they&#39;re very courageous
people
um
yeah but they&#39;re not they&#39;re not just
they&#39;re not the political class lawyer
class of
you know
kind of
nancing around
folks these are people who&#39;ve done
special operations they&#39;ve done
uh very courageous things they
understand the risks
they have the ability
to go the distance legally now
and
so far they&#39;re going the distance so
while that door is open i&#39;m making an
appeal to everyone who&#39;s listening who&#39;s
concerned about this kind of illegal
secrecy
remember this group is a transnational
group that&#39;s global
that responds to no legal government
anywhere in the world
that have technologies thousands and
years more advanced that anything
the mainstream legal constitutional
government of the united states or china
or russia or great britain or france
have
so
um
that&#39;s what you&#39;re dealing with and i&#39;m
i don&#39;t
sugarcoat
the challenge it&#39;s a huge challenge but
what we have
is
the force of higher consciousness this
is why i ask people you know when we do
that week at this week in in arizona in
in outside phoenix
in september i will lead people through
a meditation
where we put our awareness on all those
facilities and all those organizations
and to see a different energy entering
their hearts and minds to cooperate with
moving this forward
into a non-violent change
so that&#39;s very important the power of
meditation and prayer
i mean you have to work on i think many
dimensions
absolutely you know you know and you
know i get a lot of people say why don&#39;t
you just stick with disclosure things
why don&#39;t you just stick with the sea if
i said no it&#39;s all part and parcel
now i have another exciting announcement
this will be the last one
we just started last week the
organization and production of the next
huge feature film the lost century and
it&#39;s going to be an expose of a hundred
years or more
of exotic amazing free energy zero-point
energy anti-gravity technology
uh that will be a two-hour
special
that we hope to have finished to have
come out
early next year sometime
so we&#39;re starting work on that you&#39;ll be
hearing more about it
we do need the crowdfund and do some
things with it we haven&#39;t set that up
yet
but we&#39;re going to need a lot of help
and support now what if you&#39;re listening
what we need right now
anyone who has an operating
free energy device quote unquote i say
free energy meaning coming from the
quantum vacuum or zero point plasma
generators putting out more energy than
it consumes when you start it up
um
they need to contact us immediately
because we&#39;re gonna get a billion to two
billion people to see this we&#39;re gonna
use all the big influencers and a lot of
the celebrities interested in this will
get behind it
secondly we need to have
uh people who have collected archives of
past inventions that have been
suppressed
or and that have been tested and have
validity not just some rumor of
something
we need that because we want to feature
the top 10 of those
in this two-hour documentary
so anyone who has that information who&#39;s
been researching this please get that to
us
immediately because we&#39;re actually
we&#39;re actually
collecting all that now
and in september early october we&#39;re
gonna do all the interviews with people
and then be in post-production october
november december and then this will be
ready to hand off to
um whatever distributor to get it out to
the public for for 2023. so we&#39;re on a
very tight fast timeline of course
anyone who&#39;s worked with me knows that i
don&#39;t know how to work any other way but
um but it&#39;s we need help with that so
people listening if you can help us
please don&#39;t write us with just rumors
of rumors of rumors or nonsense um we
need very you know scientific
legitimate things and we&#39;re not
interested by the way in someone who has
an idea about something we have
thousands of pages of people&#39;s
theoretical ideas we&#39;re not interested
in theories we&#39;re not interested in
someone&#39;s idea
only something operational right now
that can be run
or
very solid evidence of not only the
existence of previous ones
but also their suppression how were they
suppressed were the people killed was it
confiscated
was the national security act abuse and
national security orders
were their patents confiscated
um these all these techniques have been
used in the past and we want to feature
the ones that have the strongest
evidence not just rumors
but the strongest evidence for it
because the public
think about it the public like they have
with the ufo issue where&#39;s the evidence
that&#39;s why we did the disclosure project
and put 110 top secret witness
testimonies together and all the
documents
so we have to do the same thing with
this where we prove that this is not an
urban myth
and that your tesla automobile instead
of having 900 pounds of lithium ion
batteries could have one this big
and then one of these generator motors
boom and it runs never has to be charged
never have to plug it in
huge
yeah it&#39;s a big change the idea that
you&#39;re going to do a cgi to show
what would this world look like because
people do not have the ability to
visualize
what they know is what we see right now
and they can&#39;t imagine what the world
looked like or how it would be
and that&#39;s a huge problem you know i
think part of what we&#39;re going to put
we&#39;re going to need some support for
this but we&#39;re going to have people who
can do really good graphics and and
motion graphics
and uh to show what the earth would look
like in 10 years 20 years
100 years
500 years a thousand years because it&#39;s
complete
nothing looking back thousands of years
could prepare anyone for what the world
will look like in 50
when all this technology is put into
peaceful use it is a whole new world and
that&#39;s why i&#39;m convinced the e.t
when colonel corso said what&#39;s in it for
me when the e.t at white sands in 1956
said would you help us and he you know
he was very brash and admitted to us
he&#39;s oh yeah i was just like this young
air force colonel
and
uh and the e.t said a new world
if you can take it
it is a new world beautiful
and we want to show that to people
because i think there&#39;s so much
hopelessness about the environment
inflation and oil and pollution and
toxicity and the oceans dying
it is depressing
but but that&#39;s not it you have to know
you have to describe the problem which
we will do
but we also have to describe that we
have a solution and then prove it and
then show the world in the aftermath
because it has to become a publicly
supported movement
because let&#39;s face it
any inventor that has one of these
devices if you&#39;re listening
you&#39;re not going to be able to get this
out through any conventional strategy
that a normal technology would get out
through
you&#39;re going to have to have one to two
billion people know about it
you&#39;re going to have to have strategic
security in place
you&#39;re going to have to have
an enormous infrastructure around it or
it&#39;ll be squashed like a bug
and i tell people thousands of these
devices and inventions since before
tesla
have have come and gone
why have they never gotten out into
application
because the
collusion
of corporate fascists and government
interests
that want to keep the world
centrally controlled
by certain types of people with the kind
of money and power they have
those people do not go quietly into the
night they want to hold on to that power
even if it kills the biosphere
and millions of people you know even if
you don&#39;t believe in global
climate change and warming
five million people or more a year die
from just the particulate pollution in
the air from coal and gas and pollution
and god knows how many from cancer from
all the toxicity that&#39;s in our food
supply water ground and air so it&#39;s it&#39;s
it&#39;s the the number of people who died
in the holocaust happening every year
just due to pollution
people don&#39;t think about this
and never mind there are three billion
people on the planet
that still don&#39;t have any means to cook
their food with gas or electricity
they&#39;re cutting down old-growth forests
and wood and there&#39;s what&#39;s called the
certification where this growth of
deserts is happening because it&#39;s all
being chopped down for subsistence
that&#39;s three billion people
that&#39;s nearly 30 percent
yeah yeah no it&#39;s more than 30. it&#39;s
more like 40 percent
uh or yeah it&#39;s more 40 of the world&#39;s
population so you know when you&#39;re
dealing with that kind of situation
you&#39;re not going to fix it with solar or
wind
and you&#39;re not going to fix it by just
drilling more oil and gas and coal
so one of the points we&#39;re going to make
is that both sides are right and wrong
the people advocating more oil and gas
in the sense are correct that the
current technology that people know
about
won&#39;t replace the power grid in the
united states i think the whole world
could run about
75 seconds it&#39;s estimated on the amount
of battery storage that you need for
women&#39;s and solar
that we currently have on the earth 75
seconds
it just is too little and it&#39;s going to
be too little too late
but it&#39;s also not an answer to just keep
dredging up oil gas and coal even if we
have hundreds of years of supply because
it&#39;s poisoning the planet
so both sides have
and here&#39;s the thing
always remember when both sides are
right and wrong in different aspects but
then of course in a polarized world
nobody thinks this way anymore
both are
missing something
what is this other ingredient being
missed
it&#39;s these technologies that have been
kept secret
that&#39;s the solution
and that&#39;s why the lost century and the
subcaption to it is and how to retrieve
it
um
so the law center and how to retrieve it
that is such an important thing for the
public to know about
because
uh it&#39;s not as simple as an inventor
saying oh i have a new energy thing and
the world&#39;s gonna beat a path to your
door
before the world&#39;s gonna know about it
you&#39;re gonna be killed or you&#39;re gonna
be offered 100 million dollars and be
rich it&#39;s not going to get out to the
public we have to develop a strategy
where
a billion two billion people know about
it understand it and get behind
the support socially
to
move it forward
that&#39;s how change happens when you&#39;re
dealing with a asymmetric powerful group
of folks who are very small number of
people
you know a thousandth of one percent of
the public
not with the one percent
um
but who have outsized power
and are willing to use force to maintain
that power
to change that
i mean this is real power to the people
here
to change that you have to have a
totally different way of thinking
and that&#39;s what we want to present and
we&#39;re going to need help with that so
you know
looking back in the history um some of
the largest changes socially that&#39;s
helped our world have really come from
um a grassroots uh program from people i
mean it&#39;s everything
everything right
yep
no big change that&#39;s happened in human
history has come from the people at the
top of the pyramid right because they&#39;re
at the top
they don&#39;t want to see that change right
think about it think about the power
dynamic you&#39;re right so it comes from
the base of that pyramid us
you know this is sort of ordinary
people like you and me
um
and i put myself squarely in that
category i mean having grown up very
poor in the south and with no privilege
and no
access to anything i don&#39;t i think
people have to view themselves as
uh however
how would martin luther king or gandhi
or
any past movement that&#39;s led to great
advancements in science or thought or
society happen
if we had waited for the king
or the emperor
or whoever was at the top
to do it it would have never ever ever
happened
so that&#39;s what people we live in a time
where because of the internet and social
media and smartphones and all that i
think people
and tv become more and more passive
and we have to develop an activist based
base for not only ce5 contact make
contact peacefully with these other
civilizations but to also do disclosure
which is what we&#39;re doing and then the
third part of this triangle you know our
logo is three circles
that makes it an equilateral
triangle
that that third one is the energy
the technologies and new energy systems
that will run the planet indefinitely
with no pollution
and without poverty
and therefore eventually if you solve
this the social justice poverty issues
you can eventually have a foundation for
lasting
peace
and without peace there is no future
because the technologies once you get to
the nuclear threshold are such that
without peace
you&#39;re facing every
decade or two a situation like we have
now where russia&#39;s threatening to send
nuclear weapons to america if we support
ukraine all this kind of stuff so
this sort of thinking is not sustainable
once you go past machine guns and tanks
and conventional bombs
because such an event would be the end
of life on earth
so i think we have to develop a
civilization
where it&#39;s a totally different
consciousness first
a set of values
but also the technologies go with it
it&#39;s not going to help the earth if
everyone&#39;s sitting in enlightenment in a
cave and we&#39;re all still using oil and
gas and coal
to have air conditioning and run our
cars and heat our houses
and manufacture things
you know china right now is building 30
new coal-fired power plants one of them
one that it will be the biggest one in
the world
so the
is similarly
so
this is happening all over
and it&#39;s getting worse and worse and the
only solution is
the known solution
and even though it&#39;s covert and it&#39;s
controversial
we&#39;re also going to have interviews with
really top drawer
physicists phd physicists at
universities who are going to confirm
the zero point energy field and confirm
these technologies
so this is going to be a very
hard-hitting piece
all right
so anyone who has leads for us on any of
this please contact us because we&#39;re
actually in production now
yeah when i read the description i
thought wow this is going to cover a lot
of very very important and
really very interesting stuff i mean
really
yeah it is cool
well i hope all of you can join us i&#39;ll
let you go now it&#39;s been about an hour i
think and um i gotta run but uh thank
you guys thank you pat and i hope i hope
all of you can join us uh either in
person or virtually
in
september in arizona where we&#39;ll make
contact ce5 contact in arizona in the
desert
thank you dr greer thank you bye bye
