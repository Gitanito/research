    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Psychic Century, The.
 Behold I bring you glad tidings of great joy, which shall be unto all people
 1901  Weekly
 Topeka, KS.  Publisher: Psychic Century Publishing Company.  Editor: Laura B. Payne, with W.B. Wagner as associate editor, and AH Jackson business manager.
  1/1, January 10, 1901-May 30, 1901.  4 pp., $1.00 a year.

 	  This was a short-lived journal focused on spiritualism, reform and feminism.  The Religio-Philosophical Journal noted its appearance and called it "a bright and spicy paper," but, other than serious articles by Payne on progress, spiritualism and the injustice of how society treated women, it consisted largely of selections from other journals and notes on the local spiritualist activities.  The journal reprinted a message from P.B. Randolph, received by the writing medium Mrs. Linnie Wagner, and featured a posthumous poem by E.A. Poe, poems by Lizzie Doten and Ella Wheeler Wilcox, and notes on spirit photography, frauds, and local organization.  The journal printed an excerpt from W.B. Wagner's Edna Gray: A Spiritualistic Romance, one of its editors, and advertised the services of his wife (Mrs. Inez Wagner) as a Trance and Platform Test Medium.  Noted in Banner of Light 89/4 (March 23, 1901): 4.
