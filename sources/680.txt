 Although the journal recited that it was published for the Mazdaznan association in Geneva, it was issued in Paris.  In the first issue, the publisher announced that it was happy to once more send the journal, which indicates some predecessor.  It consisted largely of translations from the writings of Dr. O.Z. Ha'nish with additional commentary, sheet music of devotional music, and advertisements for his books and the products and foods sold by the Mazdaznan movement.
