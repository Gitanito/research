  		              		Experience Description   

    I was 4 years old.  My family had just moved into a new house in Texas.  My Father left the deep freezer unplugged and the lid open out in the garage to air it out from moisture.  He was planning on filling the freezer up with deer meat the coming hunting season.  I remember seeing the deep freezer filled with meat before and was not scared of looking inside.
  
  My brother, who was 6 years old at the time, woke up early in the morning as he always did.  He woke me up early to play, as he always did on the weekends.  It was Sunday.  According to my parents, we must have gotten up around 4:30 am.  My mother told us  the night before that we would not be going to Sunday School.  We played in the living room while our parents slept.  I remember we took our pillows into the living room and made big circles out of our reading books.  We sat in the center of our circles and sang songs, laughed and read our books.  My brother then led me out into the garage.  We looked at the deep freezer with the lid open.  I knew that we should not play around the deep freezer because our Father cautioned us about the danger of getting locked inside like the neighbor's grand-daughters did.  
  
  My brother got inside and closed the lid. He  knocked and I let him out by unlatching the handle on the outside of the freezer. It latched and locked automatically as these models did back in the 1950's.  He encouraged me to get in. I was scared and said 'No' but he talked me into it.  I got into the freezer, he closed the lid. I knocked and he let me out.  Then we both climbed in and played like we were in a submarine.  Again, I could feel danger approaching. We played about and the lid fell down and locked on the outside.  It was dark, damp, musty, and cramped.  We tried to open the lid but to no avail.  We screamed and cried for our parents.  No one came.  We could not see each other but could feel each others legs and arms as we entangled trying to find a way out of the dark space.  Exhausted and out of air, we lay beside each other.  My brother's arms were around me for comfort and he was telling me it was, 'Okay Sissy.'
  
    I remember drifting off into total darkness with no fear or feeling of suffocation.  I felt like I was suspended into darkness with a peacefulness surrounding me.  My last thought was me wondering if  Mom and Dad would ever find us because I thought we had disappeared.
  
  My Father claims he was woken from a sound sleep by a voice calling to him of danger for his children.  He checked our room, the whole house and outside.  He then checked with the neighbors.  We were no where to be found. It was now approximately 6:30 am.  They called the police.  We lived at the Air Force base housing, so the police were available quickly.  They searched the whole neighbor hood and base for us.  My Father was leaning on the deep freezer talking to my Mother through the kitchen door, when he noticed that the round emblem light on the top of the deep freezer was cracked.  He immediately opened the lid and witnessed his children unconscious on the bottom of the freezer.  At first he did not see me because my brother was lying on top of me. His first thought was someone took me and locked my brother in the freezer.  My Mother grabbed the phone and dialed the ambulance, as my Father handed my brother to her.  My brother  was barely breathing, so she blew breaths into his mouth.  He stirred and woke up crying.  My Father held my limp body in his arms and began to weep.  He told my Mother that I was not breathing and that I was dead.  By now the ambulance arrived.  They declared me clinically dead without breath and without a pulse.  They performed CPR.  I remember sitting on the emergency medical technician's (EMT's) lap with an oxygen mask as they all clapped and hugged me.  I felt like I had climbed out of a tunnel and wanted to go back for some reason.  My Mother said I appeared as if I was upset at the EMTs for waking me up.
  
  I have never been the same since.  I had fainting spells periodically until I was 18 years old.  I am claustrophobic and do not like the quiet stillness of the darkness.  I sleep with a fan on all the time because  I must have air circulation.  Since this incident, I have been passionately drawn to death and dying experiences.  As a child, I knew when someone was approaching death without being told . I  was at peace with it and it gave me a peaceful feeling as if I knew they would be okay.  

  As I grew older, I leaned toward the supernatural and intuitive, spiritual-side of life.  My most passionate experiences as a nurse are working in Hospice and Oncology.  I have a gift for calming fearfulness that surrounds death and explaining end-of-life decisions with a great insight. I believe I have visited the greater life-side of the Heavens and know without a doubt that I will one day return to be with my loved ones and God.  I know in my heart that the peacefulness I felt during the incident was the reassurance of life-after-death.  I now share this with my dying patients with such reassurance that they believe, as well as myself, that I have a special gift and communication with God and the afterlife. I have vivid and realistic dreams of communication with my parents and other family members who have passed.  I have communicated with a young man who took his own life and encouraged him to leave this earth by letting him know  that he is forgiven.  I have had many of these experiences throughout my lifetime.
  
  I have never written this story down on paper and have only shared it with a few close friends.  My Father and mother refused to discuss the incident as we grew older.  Some of the scenarios I play over and over in my head, I question as if I actually watched and witnessed the whole incident unfold or do I just have a vivid recall and imagination from listening to my parents tell their fiends and family when I was young?

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   I have not been able to discuss the actual feeling about he incident until I grew older and until this time in my life.  I just talked about the 'incident'.  
  
How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I was 4 years old.  I can recall every moment of this experience as if I watched a movie about it.  I recall feeling and emotions I had that bring me to tears when I ponder on the incident.  I remember great concern for my parents losing their children.  

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably real.     I had a different calmness about myself and did not discuss the incident in great detail; either out of fear or lack of acknowledgement.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     My whole life has been drawn to the supernatural aspect of life, such as death and dying, spiritually, and the afterlife.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   darkness, poor air circulation and cramped spaces cause me great anxiety.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I am on a quest to discover if I truly had a NDE.
