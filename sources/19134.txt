the question that I&#39;d need to repeat for
for the cameras
you know the DTS play a role in the fact
that these very powerful interests that
have manipulated human opinion and
what-have-you are involved in a lot of
what we call bread and circus
distractions and will at some point the
extraterrestrial civilizations play a
role in in that kind of information and
psychological warfare race and I would
say yes and to the extent that we have
for example we just got a report from
someone who was a security officer where
one of these objects had materialized
very very close to him and what it was
in Washington state or Oregon the
Pacific Northwest and I think that a lot
of times the way that the ETS have
appeared have been ways that let enough
people know we&#39;re not alone but not too
much to kind of create hit that
invisible wire that&#39;s there where people
who would like to make hey an alien
invasion week on the History Channel
would say hey it&#39;s an alien invasion so
they&#39;re having to play this very
carefully but at the same time they&#39;re
there are so many people who have seen
like with the Phoenix lights and the
governor finally coming clean and saying
yes I saw it too and it was real this
huge two three foot across craft that
floated over the valley and I was there
the night that happened
you may know that it was actually a ce-5
I was had just stunned that the
protocols to invite them to come because
we were putting together the digital
images of UFOs to give to Congress a
month later and so that is actually how
the Phoenix lights happened obviously
they happened right above us and so it
was a ce-5 and for a purpose though it
wasn&#39;t trivial because they knew we were
putting this thing together with all
these members of Congress in 97 so that
event happened in March our briefing was
in April of 97 here in Washington and in
Georgetown and I asked them to do
something that would advance that I&#39;m
interesting the news blacked out until
June on it it really wasn&#39;t covered
outside the Phoenix area until June and
it got broken to the national news
eventually but then it was of course
explained away as flares and this and
that because they always create a cover
story so after this event happened they
sent jets up that did drop flares and
film that say see that&#39;s what this was
but people who were actually up close to
it I mean it&#39;s this massive structure
that blacked out the stars as it went
over if they were right underneath it
and it was miles across and the the Jets
that we sent up when they got close to
it just went wrong we went back to base
I mean they&#39;re right right more we know
that from some pilots at Luke Air Force
Base out there and so the I think that
the ETS want to advance the knowledge
that we&#39;re not alone but they don&#39;t want
to do in a way that is intimidating
because I think ultimately they&#39;re
incredibly evolved in consciousness and
very nonviolent so they don&#39;t want to do
anything that would be psychologically
violent or spiritually violent and
that&#39;s why it&#39;s best if this education
comes from us to each other see what I&#39;m
saying the answer you&#39;re quick as
apposed from on high down because that
could be something that could be taken
very much the wrong way and I think
that&#39;s right people get mad why are they
so secretive and why don&#39;t they just
land on the White House lawn and
actually Larry King asked me that
question and I go look I think they&#39;re
wiser than the pull a stunt like that
and also I think that they really do
think that it&#39;s it if there&#39;s something
edifying about
tackling this issue including this
national security super state that&#39;s run
amok because someone needs to rein that
in and it&#39;s unlikely to be the
politicians it&#39;s going to have to be the
people and we the people need to do it
now
that takes some degree of resolve and
courage and and you have to do something
besides you know laying on your couch
surfing through television sound
channels looking at late-night TV and
eating Cheetos you know I mean that&#39;s
part of the problem of the whole bread
and circus culture that&#39;s grown up in
our culture to society in the last few
decades is that there are so many
distractions and there&#39;s so much
ephemera and nonsense that it&#39;s easy to
keep people entertained with that and
looking in another direction while these
really important issues are really not
being addressed and I think that to an
extent is by design that it&#39;s also our
responsibility to take our own minds and
say we&#39;re gonna pay attention to these
important things and luckily there are a
lot of millions that people are looking
into all this
what I hope this next level of what
we&#39;re doing we have literally tens of
thousands of people by the way now
around the world that have gotten the
training app and are in for contact and
now we&#39;re getting the networking app so
they can be in touch with each other
because we didn&#39;t have it until just
last week and that is happening very law
a very big sort of exponential growth in
contact teams all over the world a
disclosure as I mentioned I think not
that we&#39;ve finished that task but we&#39;ve
launched it and more people believe this
is real than don&#39;t but the technology
part of it that has been the thing
that&#39;s been the hardest for me over the
last decade as I went through the litany
of all the kind of tricks and this and
that and all the disappointments but
that&#39;s we have to keep doing that
because we&#39;re really at a point in our
society where there aren&#39;t going to be
any sort of temporary fixes that are
gonna work you know I mean it&#39;s great to
have solar panels and I have my farm in
Virginia has a big 10 kilowatt solar
farm that we&#39;ve generated almost five
megawatt hours of
tricity but most people wouldn&#39;t know to
put that in and it&#39;s great you know we
have a Chevy Volt that you can plug in
and it can run off the solar panels and
it goes 40 miles but you want to drive a
hundred miles using gas so we have these
partial fixes that are coming out we
need the next level of it and and and
that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to need a lot
of support and either fundraising or
someone who can come to us and claim
this challenge an award of $100,000
which I mean I wish it were a hundred
million but that&#39;s what we can put at
stake and if people can meet the
criteria it makes us all a very happy
group and I think we will we&#39;ll let the
public know the instant we have
something legitimate that&#39;s for sure we
will not sit on it there would be
nothing secret about it
