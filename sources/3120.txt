Suppose Youth Went to School to Learn
the Fundamentals of the Soûl?
I V H A T S o r t o f C iv iliz a tio n JM igh t W e H â v e I f a n E n t ir e G é n é ra tio n
C o u ld B e E n lig h t e n e d in th e C o sm ic V e rit ie s ?
O W S T R A N G E is the circumstance that
so-called Education today makes not the
siightest attempt to enlighten the com-
mon person in what lie is, how he got
into the mortal predicament, whether he’s
accomplishing what he expected to ac-
complish by his advent into physicality, and what his con-
tinued history is to be when the current rôle is finished.
Today’s child is turn out "educated” when he knows how
to read, write, and "figger”, has a brief go at recent his­
tory, a working knowledge of geography, and a passing
contact with the findings of current "Science.” Maybe
he specializes in some branch of trade or économies that
affect to train him to make a living. W ith such superficial
skimming of "knowledge” in his head, he is supposed to
go forth, assume his place in society, and solve ail quan-
daries connected with mortal existence in evolving aspects.
His real éducation cornes, of course, in the School of
Expérience— which, correctly named, is a battlefield,
with the victor so termed because of his success in seiz-
ing generous spoils.
The interesting question has been propounded: Is it
propitious to establish an institution in life today that
truly educates the intellect and trains it to proceed up
through adulthood equipped with basic knowledge of
Man’s place in Cosmos?
Nine out of ten persons capable of grappling with it
would say: Try to educate the public— as a public— in
a basic knowledge of Man’s place in Cosmos and at once
you’re trespassing into fields of Religion. In fîelds of Re­
ligion, one man’s opinion is quite as important as an-
other man’s opinion. Furthermore, you’re due to tread
on the corns of the dergy in every instance where their
accuracies of concept may be challenged. People under
our free form of govcrnment hâve the unalienable right
to hold what religions views thev please, and adhéré to
them. Who shall pronounce what is factual and what
is not?”
Strange to note, no such attitude is advanced concern-
ing the Threc Rs, or History, Geography, or Science.
Education consists of exploring into these to the limit
of intellectual audacities, and determining what is factual
and what fallacious. Otherwise, how has Leaming itself
become of moment?
G ° . T O the common man and inquire how he feels
about being "educated” in the higher enlightenments
of Cosmic Fundamentals, however, and granting he is
not particularly squeamish about the monopolisée prov­
ince of "Religion”, he will at once interpret what you
are proposing in terms of development of uncommon
psychical faculties. Nine out of ten will readily welcome
that. They surmise it means equipping them with facul­
ties causing them to surpass their brethren in secular pur-
suits. That there can be no true cultivation of the psy­
chical faculties until the Cosmic Fundamentals are mas-
tered, he dismisses with a shrug. How has he time to
master Cosmic Fundamentals?
This whole question of true and correct educating of
the masses so that every life takes on a distinctive and
worthwhile meaning, cannot be discussed and dismissed
with a paragraph. But there are some features and fac­
tors of it that True Education should start with a broad
but timely survey of the nature and purpose of the Om-
niverse itself, followed by examination, as the data is
procurable, of the Great First Cause and in what pat­
terns and to what purposes It functions. After a fairly
comprehensive exposition of what today’s academies call
Comparative Religions— not only the Christian religion
but ail earlier religions— Man as the microcosm should
be regarded for what he is, and why his tenure in organ-
ism takes the periodic forms it does. Right there the
broader aspects of psychical phenomena should enter, so
that veritably the child understands the most ordinary
manifestations of the supernatural, and what the indica­
tions of pcrsonal survival may be, and what they prove
as to earthly significances. Thus every living human be­
ing would be acquiring an understandable background
for his life and social or économie position— with no
more hit-or-miss guefsings as to why a given individua!
should be upon the earth-planr, funetioning in a body»
As for what happens in the expérience called Death and
afterwards, and whac the empioyments of life on the
thought planes between worldly visitations are like, the
cntire design o f Mortality and Immortality would be re-
cast in the conunon person’s thinking— and morals and
ethics take on effective meanings.
T o hâve a nation thus eniightened could reasonably re­
suit in the planet Earth being inhabited by a race o f
super-beings, to which the fancied "educarings” o f the
présent w ould be as insufferable as they are trivial.
Being oble to manipulate an automaric pendl, or "hear
voices” at one’s caprice would be incidental to the vaster
and grandeur agenda o f lore that gave sensé and reason
to life in the flesh, shoving so-called Gvilizarion forward
100,000 years at a push. T he status quo would not be
"upset” so much as re-created. Humankind would sud-
denly expérience a metamorphosis in idéologies making
for understanding o f ail earthly phenomena
Imagine where such a prostitution as Communism
would stand, in the face o f such universal knowledge,
ail based upon Cosmic Fundamentals!
Imagine what a different Earth the Saucer M en would
confront in attitudes toward ail isms if the common man
and woman knew his and her Esoterics adeptly!
J 7 V E R Y truly erudite person knows that today there
are two structures o f Knowledge— the M aterialistic
or the commonly known and accredited, and the Spiritual
or esoteric, meaning reserved for the private incrément
o f the favored few. B u t less than 1 percent o f the popu­
lace is even aware o f the existence o f the last, and shar-
ing it with the hoi polloi is considered a type o f willful
dégradation. So the great rank and file o f mankind
blunders along as best it may, from génération to généra­
tion. Thereat the bigoted erudite hâve the effrontery to
bemoan the universal mess in which mass society finds
itself. T hey o f themselves take the position that the Cos­
mic Knowledge exists for application to themselves alone
— tr^aning for their enhancement as favored individuals.
They feel no obligation to pass it out promiscuously to
the M an in the Street.
Truly it is a type of snobbery they’re displaying.
But the unfortunate thing is, such snobbery reacts up­
on themselves in cosmic rétributions, in that even the
snobs must live the life in a world that’s continually a
mess due to the benighted condition of its average citi­
zen. W hat does it profit a man to hâve even omnipotent
wisdom if he must exist and practice it in a human stock-
yard filled with bellowing cattle?
' 'H E R E are so-called Metaphysical "schools” or ''col­
leges” to surfeit, which do anything but aim to ele-
vate the rank-and-file. W hat they truly perform is com-
mercializing a course in tenets pilfered from Rosicrucian-
îsm or Theosophy, whose avowed goal and object is to
make the "pupil” pyschically adept in ten— or fifty—
"easy lessons” . . These are not schools or colleges.
They are correspondence courses in cuit mysticisms, prof­
itable or spurious according as they are shaped.
M aking money by selling courses is not Education.
T o essay to lift the great rank-and-file of Man up
onto a higher échelon of general wisdom by remodeling
his approach to comprehensive Education, b quite a dif­
ferent prospect and proposât
N o where in America, actually, at the présent time
does an institution maintain that spreads no other en-
lightenment than the Philosophy of Soûl— not Religion
as Theology but quasi-scientific Cosmic Fact.
Is thb not peculiar?
Nevertheless, something is stirring to that quite frac-
tical end.
W e shall see what it b , as autumn and winter advances.
