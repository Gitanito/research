      Summary:   From Pat Deveney's database:

 Rosa-Cruz.
 Revista Mensual de Ciencia Rosa-Cruz y Estudios Afines / Organo comunicativo de la Fraternidad Rosa-Cruz Antiqua.
 Other titles: Revista Rosacruz
 1930--1937  Monthly
 Berlin, Germany, then Texas, and (after World War II) in Marburg, Germany.  Language:  Spanish.  Publisher: Blucher.  Editor: Arnoldo Krumm-Heller (Huirachocha).
 Succeeds: Der Rosenkreuzer
 4/1, 1930-1937.  18 pp., 5 Marks a year.

  The journal was continued (or revived) in Marburg, after Krumm-Heller's death, since an issue survives from 1952.  This was the continuation of Arnoldo Krumm-Heller's Der Rosenkreuzer, published in his role as head of the Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua and O.T.O. X(o) for Mexico and Central and South America.  Its early issues contained Krumm-Heller's recollections of South American and European travel and his is service on the Eastern Front during the war, but its function seems to have been to provide a few insights into sex and astrology and to promote his books and mention the success of various Rosicrucian lodges and of his Gnostic Catholic Church..
