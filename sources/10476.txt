I could not reach the side of the pool after jumping in, and I couldn't stay above the water. I remember accepting death.

The next thing I remember is seeing my mother jumping the pool fence and diving into the pool. Her image was distorted as if I was looking through the water. Next, I remember lots of shouting and crying and my family all huddled over something. I remember trying to talk to them, but they couldn't see or hear me. Then I remember a tunnel with a light at the end. It was a very bright light, but it did not hurt my eyes. I can remember not wanting to return to my body, but being forced to go back.

Then I remember the physical pain caused, not by returning, but the by the pain of being alive.

Two weeks later, I was awakened from my coma by a glass bottle breaking at my bedside. That's when I told my parents about my experience.

God, Spiritual and Religion:

What was your religion prior to your experience?    Liberal   To young!

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?       No     I was too young to have had any religious beliefs. Now I have no doubt there is a 'GOD,' but I don't belong to a particular faith.

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      Yes   I learned that all our thoughts, words and actions have consequences.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       Yes     I am able to feel other people's emotions.
