  Martin Gardner in Urantia notes that this journal had been started in 1904.  If that is so, it was revived in a new series in 1946.  This was the journal of the Kosmon Church and Fraternity of Faithists in England, designed both to spread the word of Kosmon to non-believers and to expound the details of John Newbrough's Oahspe to members.  Skidmore Library, Lily Dale (2 issues).
