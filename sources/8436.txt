  Dr. Jeff and I embarked on a   journey of discovery on Valentine's Day 2000.&nbsp; Now the   Soulmate  project comes  full-circle on   Valentine's Day 2003.&nbsp; What is interesting is that most of the in-depth study   provided by near-death experiencer  (NDEr )   insights has validated the introduction to Soulmates    that was written in November 2000 (Long, 2000).&nbsp; Moreover, this study has added   new dimension and insights into the study of Soulmates .&nbsp;&nbsp;   We've come a long way from Webster's dictionary where soul mate means &quot;a person   temperamentally suited to another.&quot;&nbsp;

  In looking at prior cultural   tradition of Soulmates , one often runs across the   terms of karmic, dharmic , and twin flames.&nbsp; Karmic   soul mates are those who travel throughout time with each other and experience   the cause/effect of their actions on each other until they solve the underlying   issue.&nbsp; Dharmic  soul mates are those who are   helpmates, usually associated with positive actions accumulated over many   lifetimes.&nbsp; Twin flames are those two persons who are split from the same soul   nucleus (Long, 2000).&nbsp; In actuality, all of these concepts have a basis in truth   according to the NDE Soulmate  studies.&nbsp; However,   there are overriding principals that tie all of these concepts together.&nbsp;

  At the very core of our being,   are issues of, &quot;who are we?&quot;, &quot;where do we come from?&quot;, and &quot;what purpose do we   serve here on  earth?&quot;&nbsp;

  &quot;We&quot; appear to be individual   streams of universal consciousness (Long, Jody 2002   Soulmates     and Consciousness ).&nbsp;    Each individual stream breaks off or leaves the interconnectedness of the   universal consciousness and attaches itself to a physical, earthly body.&nbsp; The   stream of consciousness contains the memories, emotions, and thought processes.&nbsp;   The physical brain acts as an interface between routine thought and activities.&nbsp;   The stream of consciousness is responsible for creative thought and exercising   free will.&nbsp;

  Some characteristics of   consciousness are emotions, spiritual growth, and the need to interconnect with   other individuals (Long, Jody 2003 Emotions ).&nbsp;   Emotions are a universal constant that ties our earth reality to the other   side.&nbsp; It is possible that love is not only an emotion, but a component of the   fourth (or greater) dimension as a communication matrix (Long, Jody 2002   Fourth Dimension ).&nbsp;

  Another dimension to  Soulmates  is that there are many streams of   consciousness who  are learning the same or similar   lessons.&nbsp; Some are teachers who have mastered the lessons and guide us along our   path.&nbsp; Some are students who incarnate on earth together.&nbsp; One of the more   surprising results came from the study on beings (Long, Jody 2002   Beings ).&nbsp; Here it was discovered   that there is a high percentage of blood relatives who   NDErs  see on the other side or who communicate with the living very soon   after passing away.&nbsp; More parents opted to come back to earth for the children   or children for their parents than for any other reason.&nbsp; This is a curious   result that would support a theory that the soul and the DNA may be connected   according to a cluster group with whom we travel throughout time with and learn   lessons together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Our universal purpose is to   learn to love ourselves and to love one another.&nbsp; By properly learning this   lesson on earth, we are able to reconnect with the universal stream of   consciousness, otherwise known as God/Jesus/Supreme Being.&nbsp; It appears that we   may be separated from the other side as a mechanism to exercise free will.&nbsp; This   is not inherently a good or an evil process; It    simply is what it is.&nbsp; Only by being removed from the environment of total love   and knowledge, could we be motivated to grow by learning to reconnect to the   universal stream of consciousness.

  According to what  NDErs  report in the life review, most say we are   learning the lessons of cause/effect of our actions on others.&nbsp; The way we   interpret the cause and effect on others is by looking at how we feel about the   actions and can feel others emotional reactions to our initial actions.&nbsp; The top   three answers to universal purpose had to do with our life cycle on earth as   part of a continual, natural process in the evolution of the soul and that we   were to love and help one another.&nbsp;

  It was very curious that in the   study of universal purpose, life changes, and life review, there were not a lot   of people who mentioned relationships or family.&nbsp; Yet, in the   Beings  paper, blood relatives were   prominently mentioned.&nbsp; On the other hand, the life review, universal purpose,   and life changes, talk about the need to love one another and reconnect with the   stream of universal consciousness.&nbsp; Perhaps, as separate streams of   consciousness, it is necessary to incarnate with our individual soul-cluster   group to have the support system on earth.&nbsp; Nevertheless, when we reconnect with   God, we all merge into one collective consciousness whose communication and   knowledge base is love.&nbsp;

  Applying the principals above, a   plausible explanation is that relationships are not the primary purpose for   coming to earth.&nbsp; However, relationships are the primary tool in learning to   love and thereby, promoting soul growth.&nbsp; M. Scott Peck's definition of love in  The Road Less Traveled,      is very close to what NDErs  say, that love is the   will to extend one's self to nourish one's own or another's spiritual growth   (Peck, p.81).&nbsp;

  Both, family and significant   other relationships serve the function learning lessons.&nbsp; However, the   mechanisms are slightly different.&nbsp; The family relationships are a type of  Soulmate  relationship where soul clusters travel   together to learn lessons with each other.&nbsp; The function may be support or in   other cases antagonistic in order to set the stage for future individual   lessons.&nbsp;

  The significant other is very   close to us and in many ways acts as a mirror of ourselves .&nbsp;   As we allow love to grow within ourselves, such as when we &quot;fall in love,&quot; any   blocked emotions in ourselves will be moved or exposed.&nbsp; The closer we get to a   significant other the stronger the mirror effect; the more love exists and the   deeper, childhood blockages start to surface.&nbsp; Thus, there is turmoil and   conflict and old issues resurface to be consciously dealt with.&nbsp; This is the   phase that people talk about when the &quot;honeymoon is over.&quot;

  Have you ever heard that saying   that when a couple argues, typically it is two 3 year olds in conflict?&nbsp; This   happens because of how our consciousness has evolved on earth.&nbsp; We, as a   species, developed in a manner so that we could keep our conscious mind free to   deal with new issues.&nbsp; Therefore, most of our actions are out of habit and we   only break out of habit when we are confronted with new situations.&nbsp; Many people   have never explored how they act when they get angry and what triggers the angry   response.&nbsp; Most likely, if one looks deep enough, these behaviors were ingrained   in the psyche at an early age and in response to one's parents or siblings.&nbsp; The   behavior is usually the same, only transfers to the significant other when we   grow up and leave the family nest.&nbsp; The ingrained behaviors become a habitual   coping mechanism used the rest of one's life unless we consciously exercise our   free will to change the behavior into a new coping mechanism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  The lessons learned in the   family, extend and intensify with a significant other.&nbsp; We also take the same   lessons and the same habitual behavior to work and with our friends.&nbsp;   Ultimately, the greatest expression of our learning and soul growth is when we   can expand our love for one another and continue in our quest for reconnecting   with the universal stream of consciousness.

  So, when looking at the karmic,  dharmic , and twin flame theories of  Soulmates , we see that there is a grain of truth.&nbsp;   We continue to struggle with family, significant others, work, and with our   views of God, until we can reconcile erroneous belief systems with our true   nature by exercising love for all.&nbsp; As bleak as life may seem sometimes, there   are people there who are purposely sprinkled along our path to help us achieve   reconnection with God  -  they are dharmic  connections   that help keep us balanced.&nbsp; The twin flame theory could have its roots in all   of us being part of the same stream of universal consciousness, whether that is   in a fourth or much greater dimension ' we'll find out on the other side.
