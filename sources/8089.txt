  		Describe the Experience:     

  Ever since I can remember, I had a distinct feeling that I do not belong here and that this place is not my home. I grew up with an abusive father, whose violence was unpredictable daily; he also hit my mother and my sister. My parents divorced when I was 12, part of me was relieved and other part of me was sad from huge changes. My older sister went off to college in another stat. My mother was very depressed, although she was very good, kind, and supportive of me.  I started hanging out with the wrong crowd.  Some of my friends were nice and had integrity, others seem to violate my trust.   I  ran away from home when I was 15 years old. I  had very terrifying experiences on the streets, like being kidnapped by a psychotic cocaine dealer. I have PTSD, that started  with my father when I was young. Now, I’d rather be alone with only a few friends that I can truly trust, rather than try to please others  like I did before.  

  In 1989, I felt like I had been through a personal war with many heartless predators.  I was having migraines and headaches every day for months and I just couldn’t take it anymore. I was emotionally destroyed.  I felt like my Mom was falling apart, I  had  no other family for my support system, and I was surrounded by the the wrong people who were so corrupt and immoral.  

  I went back onto my waterbed and was waiting for all of those pills I took with the vodka to start taking effect. 

  There was no particular thought at first, just a feeling. It was a powerful feeling. I was telling my body it’s time for me to go now. I wanted to go and was ready to let it all go. Right then, I felt this bizarre large thump in my chest. Then everything started going dark. A few seconds later, I suddenly found myself looking down on my best friend's head and understanding that she was crying,  frantic, and calling for my mother. My mother ran into the room. 

  Initially, I didn’t understand what was happening. I thought it was odd that they were having some kind of panic over someone in my bed. And I didn’t understand who was in my bed? Then I looked down closer and  saw a familiar face.  I was stunned for a moment, realizing, 'Oh, that’s my body! Poor thing, Goodbye old friend,' I thought to myself.  I feel slightly guilty that I was only a little worried about my mom being sad if I died. But I felt like she would be OK in about a year. 

  Suddenly, I felt this incredible freedom. It was like a rush of immense joy and liberation. I was no longer limited by my body and I could just completely be myself. I felt confident, even brave.  I was floating upwards, but not too fast. I saw everything but with added colors, added textures, and even added feelings. It sounds a little funny, but even the molecules in the wood in the ceiling that I floated through, had some type of stagnant energy.  I saw the roof of my townhouse complex and the pool.  Then, I started going a little faster. Suddenly, I was past the clouds and into the stars. I could see the moon, but it had a different kind of hue around it. It was the same moon that I’ve always cherished, but the glow now showed a purple hue. In fact, I could see purple almost everywhere until I entered the churning blackness. I didn’t understand it until later, but I was seeing reflections of other spiritual energy that was like me but in the universe.   

  I entered into an  area that was  farther away from the stars and darker. But I was so focused on exploring this whole new feeling of freedom, that I wasn’t really paying attention. It’s almost like I just wandered right in, not even thinking about my safety. It was all new and  exciting. I was getting used to my new senses, the new reality, and realizing that I was able to see so much despite not having eyes. This place darkness that I had gradually entered into was like a giant area of thick blackness that was churning into itself.  It had  a dull roar-type of low hum in the background. It was a substance that was  was moving very slowly in a predictable direction. I didn't feel like it was  good or bad; but rather,  it was neutral. 

  After a moment, I knew that  other beings were coming closer to me. I also knew that they were unfriendly with bad intentions towards me. I suddenly felt very vulnerable, having no idea if I even had any form of protection or power to avoid these negative beings.  As they got closer, I felt who they were. I felt  their feelings, thoughts, and personalities. I knew that they were never humans, but I didn’t understand what they were. They were creatures who  started reading my thoughts.  I didn’t want them to do that because it was scaring me. Then heir thoughts and feelings started intruding on my thoughts and  I didn’t want that either. I didn’t know what was happening or how to stop it.   

  The followers of the lead creature did not have eyes,  noses, or a  mouth. They didn’t have body structures like what you would think of as typical or normal. It was like they were contortions of wretched anguish and misery.   The leader was gigantic with some red and orange colors in it and about 18 or 20 feet tall. This being was not Male or Female, it was a monster with no gender. While it did not have a physical body, it’s energy was like a deeply, intelligent being  like a deranged serial killer of the innocent. I could sense its  heartlessness and vindictiveness.  As they got closer to me, the leader, used a strange voice of rage and it hated me, and I mean really hated me.  I asked it bluntly, 'Why are you so angry at me? Who are you? I don’t understand why do you hate me so much?'  The first thing it said to me was 'Don’t you even know who you are?' And I replied, 'No. Who am I?'  

  The leader seemed to be exploding at this point.   It said, 'God the FATHER, you don’t even know you’re a child of THE FATHER? It’s not fair, you should be just as doomed as we are!' That’s when I started to really have a feeling of terror.   I called out immediately, 'JESUS, SAVE ME, I’m scared!! JESUS, where are you?! Help me!!'  I knew instantly that I would  be rescued.     Then the light of Jesus rapidly moved towards me.  The demons immediately started backing away. 

   I was suddenly pulled out of the churning blackness and intoa tunnel of light. It was filled with beautiful, powerful light. I knew I was completely safe and surrounded by love, goodness,  wisdom, and authority. Jesus embraced me. He was not in a body, but was a being a light  in the brightest white, golden light, it did not hurt my eyes.The bright, white, golden light is all about what is good, healthy, kind and loyal. It also is  safety, integrity, trustworthiness, honesty, omniscience, and kingly. When he embraced my soul into his soul, it was like every bit of pain in my spirit was cleansed and healed. But this was only during the embrace.

    Jesus Christ's spirit was like  the equivalent of 500 feet wide and 1000 feet tall.  I instantly knew it was him, and he reassured me and calmed me down. He told me that since I was already there with him, that he was going to show me my life to  help me understand about many things so that I would be more patient when I  returned  to my body. I refused to go back into my body. He was very patient and very gentle with me.  He knew I was upset and he was determined to have me calm down,  trust and listen to him. So I did. I was  so indescribably happy and more at peace than  ever before  in my entire lifetime. I was willing to listen to whatever he wanted to tell me. Where we were, it was like a part of heaven, but I didn’t see any relatives or anything. This was like a special place reserved for me. I say reserved,  like I was in a different section of heaven. During my life review, I felt and saw everything I had ever said or done.  I saw every impact I had on others, whether intentional or not, like a ripple on the water. He showed me my very essence, and he explained that different souls have different roles, depending on who they originated from and what they did with themselves regardless of the situations. Most important of all, was HOW they responded to love or goodness. 

    Overall, Jesus told me that not only did I have enough goodness in me, but that despite a few weaknesses, that I will mature and that I am destined to go to heaven by virtue of who I am. I asked, 'Who am I then? Why is this such a big deal 'who I am?'  Jesus explained that there are different levels of goodness. Some people have potential for goodness and they can get into heaven, some people are basically born with so much goodness already in them that they don’t have to try very hard to get into heaven.  Then there are those who were descendants of God’s original energy who God is drawing  ‘Back unto himself.’    I told Jesus that I didn’t understand God and that I was still a little bit mad at God for allowing all of the suffering on earth.    Jesus told me that it was basically ridiculous of me to be mad at God because that’s like being mad at my own arm or leg.  He said that we all have spiritual jobs to complete on earth. I told Jesus that whatever my job is, I don’t want it and I’m too tired to do it anymore.  I feel like Jesus almost laughed, but it was like he was slightly amused and simultaneously worried about me.   

  Jesus and I had instantaneous communication.  Jesus told me that there have been many souls like me around the world, whose job it is to be God’s witnesses. He said that is why I go through so much suffering and experience so much evil.  It is  not because I am evil, but because Evil  wants to destroy anyone and anything that is good. Evil works through people's weaknesses.  Jesus showed me part of God's order of the universe, and he said that’s the one thing I’m not allowed to bring back with me is that knowledge of how it all  works. He explained that the knowledge would interfere with my spiritual growth. The only thing I remember about that part is concluding that it was so complicated that there’s no way anyone could understand it in the first place.   

  I finally understood that Jesus was going to send me back into my body no matter how much I protested. I needed to finish my job in this life for myself and for God. I was still a little sad because I did not want to leave him and I loved being around him. 

  In 2004, I got to that point again just like a 1989, when I just couldn’t take it anymore. I was in physical pain, felt extreme loneliness, and the people I surrounded myself with were just using me and not being there for me when I needed support or help.   I tried to kill myself again. I hoped that I would just never wake up after taking pills. I think my entire system was so overloaded with poison and the intensity of stress that it caused the  whole left side of my body to go limp. My arm felt weird and heavy. I think I had a TIA stroke but I’ll never know for sure.    

  I literally felt what seemed like a deep thunder.  It was a  voice that I felt both in and outside of my head tell me authoritatively that, 'I am with you. You can do this; do not step out of your place.'  I started crying and hyperventilating. All I know is right after that, I feel like I left my body for the second time in my life.  I recognized going through the ceiling and going through space as I passed the stars. But this time when I saw that darkness and the distance, I avoided it. I called out for Jesus  again. I saw Jesus as the beautiful, bright familiar light of love again but this time behind him, there was a new presence I had never seen before. The presence filled the entire space or sky around us. It was like a horizon of spirit that was so gargantuan,  like Jesus Christ times 20 billion. It was God! God the Father, told me in Strict terms that I cannot escape my body again, that I will finish my job on earth. This was not just for his glory but for my own spiritual state. He said that if I ever try to commit suicide again, that he has the power to intervene and send one of his other children to stop me or make any other suicide attempt fail. I was a little scared and very sad, and a bit ashamed. 

  I cried out to him like I never have before, 'What can I do? I have no family to help me. I feel so alone.' Almighty God  then said to me in a booming voice, but in a very loving way without hurting me,   'You have not been alone for even one moment in your entire life.  I have been there ready to be with you as soon as you reach for me; as soon as you ask for me. I have also worked through my gift to you of Jesus Christ.  I love you and you are my child. I will say it again so you will remember, 'YOU ARE MY CHILD AND I LOVE YOU.'    

  God showed me  something like a movie. He showed me how much I’ve grown spiritually, even though I may not know it yet. God told me that he’s proud of me and that I am almost finished. He said that if I can just complete my work here, all of my eternity will be filled with the love and peace that I need.   I apologized to God and told him that I will do my best and that I will try to remind myself that this suffering in this life and in my body will all be forgotten when I will be allowed to stay in heaven. Both God and Jesus reassured me that I will absolutely go to heaven because  that it is my destiny.  When I’m finished with my spiritual journey and I’ve completed my work for God, then I will fit perfectly into God's mighty puzzle.  
  

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 1989 & 2004  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes   Illness Heart attack.  Suicide attempts. In 1989, I was exhausted physically from having migraines every week, headaches every day, and some neurological problems. I committed suicide by overdosing on pills and alcohol.     In 2004, I tried to commit suicide again.  Apparently, I went into a coma for a couple of days.  My skin turned yellow for almost 2 weeks. Then  I had the stroke, everything blacked out and I went through a similar experience from 1989.  

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Both pleasant AND distressing  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   It was different because I could feel different energies around me.  I could feel and sense everything around me, it was like a  dolphin's sonar but yet with a higher understanding of the essence of everything around me. Colors were also deeper, brighter, and even had different variations I’ve never experienced before. The colors were  particles of energy.  

  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         After I passed the stars and the moon, I started forming a stronger awareness of who I am. I was at my highest level of consciousness right before I was pulled out of the blackness by Jesus Christ to save me from the demons chasing me.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     There was no time; it’s almost like time belong to the  three dimensional world or something. Like the past, the present and the future always has been and is  happening all at the same time. It was strange to me and I still don’t understand that part. I was only dead for three minutes according to my best friend who saw me die in my bed. To me it felt like 4 to 6 hours.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       Since I no longer had eyeballs, or a face,  my hands or any other sensory organs, I feel like my spirit was sensing and responding to everything around me in an entirely new and different way. I didn’t have eyes, yet colors looked brilliant and more beautiful than any picture. I don’t think our eyes can sense all the different spectrums of energy and light out there. At least that’s how it felt.  

  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      My hearing was only different in that I could instantaneously sense what another being was feeling and thinking. When I was in the turning blackness or void, I felt or heard a dull hum or low, humming metallic sound.  But it was a continuous sound with a repeating  pattern like it was churning over and over again. But the demons, of course, were different.  They were distinct individuals with attitudes, emotions, and intentions. I could hear their thoughts, even though they didn’t have a mouth. When Jesus spoke, it was Like ESP or instant communication.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, and the facts have been checked out  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     When Jesus responded to me  calling out to him, he came instantly and I was being pulled towards the tunnel of light. It was coming to me, and as I got closer, it got bigger. It became a tunnel of beautiful light with  intricate designs.  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

  Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   Of course the beautiful, bright, white light of Jesus Christ was spectacular. The brightness didn’t hurt at all. There was  a golden hue to Christ's  bright white light. Other colors or lights were more prominent and distinct, especially the moon, because I didn’t know it had purple around it. It’s just that you can’t see that when you’re still in your body.  

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.      I was  passing through the same universe because I flew by the stars and the moon. However, the part of heaven where I was held and shown my life review, didn’t seem like any picture from outer space that NASA would have. It’s nothing like anything we have any science book.   

  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Before I saw Jesus, when the demons were angry at me, I was terrified and in a panic. I felt helpless.When I cried out to Jesus to rescue me,  I felt extremely happy, loved, and so much peace. I was very safe and overjoyed. There was no question, it was impossible for anything to ever hurt me there. 

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt no longer in conflict with nature  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe.     My answer is somewhere between 'everything about myself or others' and 'everything about the universe.' I do feel like I should lean more towards the answer of understanding more about the universe which includes myself and others. I was shown, after my life review, there were  structures that provided order in the universe, but they were only probably 10%. And I’m guessing the other, approximate 90% of the structures are scattered throughout the universe. All I know is that when I sensed them, they had huge volumes of knowledge, almost like a super computer that was organic.  

  Did scenes from your past come back to you?         My past flashed before me, out of my control.     I had a life review. All of it was real and  I recognized it. There was light and then in one portion of the light, Jesus brought up images and feelings that I recognized as having  experienced or done in my life.  

  Did scenes from the future come to you?         Scenes from my personal future.     I was told that I would have to endure even more to complete my job on earth.  

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will.  I was so happy to be with Jesus Christ and out of my body; away from suffering and away from earth where there’s so much misery,  scary people and diseases. I was at peace, happy, and loved.  I told Jesus that I did not want to leave him and that I refuse to go back. He very gently, like a parent, told me that I must return and that I’m not finished yet.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Catholic.   I’ve known Jesus personally since I was about 4. As I grew into a teenager, I just knew him as the Presence and that he did answer to the name Jesus. I’ve been Catholic all of my life, although I suppose I would’ve been deemed a liberal Catholic by some. I never fully went by church teachings. I  went by what Jesus made me feel and how he taught me. I do however, admire and love the way the Catholic Church always reveres God and Christ with so much respect, dignity, and maturity. During both experiences, I was extremely close in my relationship to Jesus Christ; I just wanted to escape my earthly suffering and resorted to desperate measures.  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

  What is your religion now?         Christian- Catholic.   I love the Catholic Church, in particular because I feel like Jesus Christ himself approves of the intensity of Catholic reverence and humility. A crucifix is not a crucifix until one believes that it represents Jesus' sacrifice and love for us. The power does not come from the object', the power comes from our beliefs which reaches out spiritually and then connects to Jesus Christ. God is omnipresent but Jesus is a direct path to God. He is the way, just like he said when he was in his body on earth. A Muslim friend of mine, whom I adore, once asked me why would God need to send his son since God is God. I answered that God did not need to do anything, but that we needed help from him, and he provided a path from our weaknesses to his strength.  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I knew Jesus Christ was real, since I was a small child.  This was before anyone told me about him and  before I knew what a  Bible was. My mom told me years later, that when I was three or four years old that I complain one day that I was upset because I missed being able to fly around, whatever that meant. The parts I was not expecting or not consistent with my beliefs is that I learned that the Bible is incomplete. It is fine to follow the Bible, but they didn’t put together all of the written scrolls, and that some of the translations should not be taken literally.   Jesus himself told me that it is incorrect to say that you should never judge, he said that’s a mistranslation when I questioned him about it. He said you should judge basically. In other words you should judge who and what is around you to protect yourself. So, when people say that Jesus said 'do not judge' that meant that you shouldn’t be hard on people if they’re trying their best.   Jesus told me he never said to literally let people walk all over you, ignore whatever people do so you’re won’t be considered judgmental. He said that’s not something he wants. He wants us to know who is around us and their intentions. You could compare it to the phrase and you shall know them by their fruits. You have to judge to know what’s around you. Otherwise that’s like walking into a fire and then saying 'Well, I didn’t want to be judgmental.'  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Uncertain       

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   The voices that I heard where at first the demons, especially the leader who was very aggressive and angry towards me for no reason. His voice was scratchy,  sour, and didn’t sound like a human voice. It just sounded like a strange, monster voice. The other voices I heard of Jesus and God.  Jesus Christ's  voice was pure, sweet, and solid. The voice of God was extremely deep and almost like thunder. It boomed every time he used a word to help me understand what he was trying to communicate in my language. His voice didn’t hurt me, but it made me feel like I was five years old in front of a giant.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

  During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     I was only told that I am a descendent of God’s energy. I am like  a puzzle piece of the  original puzzle. I’ve got energy that he used to create the universe. 

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Uncertain.     I don’t know is if there’s unity, maybe they’re used to be or maybe there will be again. Right now it seems discombobulated from my experience. Things started going away from God’s order and now there is not unity.   
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I experience both Jesus Christ and then later, God the Creator. It was explained to me that I am  a piece of  the original energy that  God took from himself to create the universe.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

  During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   Just the same part about being told that I under a lot of suffering on earth because I’m one of the many souls that are supposed to be witnesses. When I asked if I could have a different job, Jesus told me that’s impossible because  I was born for that purpose.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     I only know what I was told and shown about my job on earth, being one of God's witnesses. I remember being shown or learning that the earth is like a stage, like a live play, and nobody but God could possibly comprehend how it will turn out.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.There is absolutely, definitely and without a doubt, existence after physical death. There is a heaven and there is a hell. I think there’s even a place that’s neutral, but that makes people vulnerable as I experienced. I know I was not in hell, but initially, I was not in heaven  either. The only thing I don’t know was when it was explained to me that God is about to be finished with his creation. I don’t know any particulars on that part.  

  Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     That I have to be really careful what I allow to grow in my heart and soul. Even being a victim of violence myself, I know that if I harbor too much hatred, that hatred turns into darkness, and that darkness hurts my soul. I have to rise above the evil and eventually return to being like a wise but innocent child.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     I was shown that behind the scenes there are demonic whispers who try to destroy peoples' lives in one form or another. I saw God’s angels trying to intervene,  sometimes God’s children  intervened  because they have a lot of goodness in them.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     Love is not just a good feeling. Love encompasses so many things, including choices to not be selfish and to think of the other peoples'  needs and feelings. Love is also empathy  for other humans,  animals, and even how you treat a flower. Everything has a ripple effect. Love protects; love seeks balance and harmony. Greed, selfishness, and cruelty are the opposite of love. Cruelty is the absence of love and disturbs harmony in the universe.  

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Moderate changes in my life.     The main difference that I have felt since is that  I feel everybody’s emotions around me, whether I want to or not. I feel like a human antenna for other peoples' emotions and feelings. It can be helpful in many ways,  like a radar or warning system to help protect me. It also helps me help others because I can sense intuitively what they are truly feeling behind their smile or words.  But sometimes it gets really draining. Sometimes, I don’t want to feel everybody’s feelings. But every time I try not to care, I still care and then try to help people. Sometimes, I feel like it’s a curse because I can’t stop caring about how other people feel, even when it makes me tired. But I know really, that’s a blessing. Sometimes, I just get a little frustrated and a little tired so I need a little vacation. I’m looking forward to my permanent vacation and having one day.   

  Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I cannot be around people with bad tempers  anymore. It overwhelms me and  makes me feel like they’re on fire and they’re brushing up against me. I can feel the rage as it starts crawling all over me, not like an animal but it smothers me.  I can’t be in this life covered with someone else’s rage. It’s too heavy.  

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It is a little challenging to put it all into human language since the experiences and realizations are spiritual.  There’s only so much that human science can explain. There is no formula for this because it’s too big for the human mind, even for a genius. A person can not completely understand until they are out of  body and experience that kind of freedom. It’s a different reality. It’s also a complete realization and then joining of an entirely huge universe that seems somehow held back from us when we’re on earth and in an organic form.  

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I remember being out of my body like it was yesterday. I love thinking about it and it often consoles me in times of difficulty or sadness. In fact, I remember that better,  more vividly, and more distinctly than what I did last week.  

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I can feel everybody’s feelings constantly and I don’t know how to turn that off. Sometimes I have to run away a bit and take a break. I take time to  regenerate. Otherwise I would get overwhelmed by everyone’s feelings.  

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          I’m just happy to have the satisfaction that if anyone hurts me, that I’m hoping God will sentence them to hell. I know that sounds a little bit negative, but do you really want evil people in heaven? We need good people and kind people with a conscience and integrity. Some things cannot be forgiven, especially if they created permanent damage or are cruel.  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I’ve only told my mother who believes  me, and an ex-boyfriend who said I must’ve imagined the whole thing. I really don’t mind what anyone thinks or if they don’t believe me. I just feel sorry for them, because they’re going to find out eventually anyway. It’s like if someone tells themselves that there is no ocean, when there really is. Whatever they think doesn’t change reality.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I was euphoric that what I felt was  even better than I had thought it would be. I sensed there was an afterlife, but that belief wasn’t based on what anyone told me in any church. I just felt it. I knew it was definitely real, and there is no way I would have just a dream about all that. There were too many amazing and higher thinking,  advanced knowledge that could never take place in someone’s dream.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real       

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I wish everyone the best in your journey in this life.  It can be very difficult and there are a lot of good people, but there are a lot of scary people as well. No matter what anyone else does though, I learned the best way to approach it is to  rise above the evil.   It comforts me to reflect on when I died, it makes me so happy. I know maybe other people have different life circumstances where they would say, all life is so precious, or thank goodness you made it and you’re still alive. But to me, I can’t wait to just get out of here,  go back to heaven, and be around Jesus Christ. I was very happy there. 

  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I enjoyed your questionnaire, thank you!
