we&#39;re dealing with civilizations were
almost every aspect of how they appear
in our time space would look like magic
to us and in the CIA this is actually
called ws fm sounds like a radio station
it stands for weird science and freakin
magic a spacecraft can be completely 3d
like you see a solid aircraft it can be
partially in this dimension but shifted
mostly into another dimension
so I liken this to like when you&#39;re
turning a dial on an old AM radio and
you can move it across you suddenly pick
up Chicago and New York at the same time
they&#39;re bleeding together dimensional
bleeding and so often these ET craft
will be partially in this dimension but
mostly out and all that we will detect
in this dimension might be an electronic
signature or or an object that appears
and flashes in and out a scintillation
of light that then vanishes or an object
that comes in where it looks almost like
a hologram of an ET B that will be
standing amongst us but it&#39;s an
electronically teleported version of
that conscious being I love this one his
name is appease you it&#39;s pronounced
Bijou
he&#39;s an interstellar beam from Andromeda
and he has a very bright looking nose
because there was a or appear that
teleported him onto the site with the
naked eye the only thing that was seen
was this sphere that came up right
beside my shoulder when I asked him
where he was from he said it&#39;s from
Andromeda galaxy they&#39;re interested if
you have a pure heart a clear intent and
you&#39;re wanting to join them in universal
peace that&#39;s it
you
