  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  I was in deep and complete unconsciousness. I felt that there is a woman near my head in white dress taking caring of me. When I woke up, I thought she was the nurse. I wanted to thank her, but the people around me told me there was nobody around me. When I asked the priest, he told me that the woman was the Virgin Mary.
