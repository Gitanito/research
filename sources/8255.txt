  		              		Experience Description   

    It was summer and   I was at the edge of the pool in my grandparents' yard.  I was playing with a  little boat that quickly drifted from the edge of the pool and  towards the middle of the pool.  My aunt was near the pool, but I had escaped her control for the moment.  I wanted to get my boat. So I climbed down the metal ladder where the boat was approaching.  I missed the last step,  lost my grip on the hand rail, and instantly ended up under water.  This was not good because I didn't know how to swim.  I realized that  I couldn't breathe anything but water and that I was in terrible danger.  I don't remember how much time passed. I do recall that I was close to my body but in an overhead position. I clearly saw my aunt's long hair spread out in a radial pattern across her back. I saw my body as it was bobbing up and down under the water.
  
  My aunt immediately brought me to the surface at the side of the pool.  I hadn't swallowed even a sip of water.   I  was crying and in hysterics. My aunt kept trying to comfort me becasue she thought I was scared. I kept crying from my rage and irritation at being brought back to the surface. She had  taken me away from a wondrously different condition, one that I now can't manage to remember in the slightest.  I was crying and wondering why she wanted to comfort me for having taken me away by force from something so beautiful, and this triggered uncontrollable fury in me.
  
  The years went by, and I became convinced the vision could have been nothing but a patchwork of snapshots that I had actually seen underwater during the moments of my rescue.  Except I kept remembering a seemingly  insignificant detail that I couldn't forget.   I remember the incredibly clear, vivid, detailed, and focused view of the  hair, spread out in a radial pattern and bobbing up and down, almost as if I saw each strand individually one by one.  At  that moment, I wasn't wearing an underwater mask or swimming goggles.  If I had seen that hair underwater with nothing on my eyes, I would have had a view with only a blurred memory. That's absolutely not so.  Furthermore, I can't figure out how come every detail of that distant event comes back to me so clearly, so present in my memory, while the rest of my days as a child are all becoming distant memories and far less distinct.

What is your religion now?         Christian- Catholic     

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I was too little for complex ideas about my beliefs.  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Uncertain     Too little to assess changes.  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Uncertain   I don't remember; it might be.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists            

  Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Uncertain     I could have had this kind of awareness, but it's only a left-over feeling and not a clear memory.  
  
During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Unknown.     My interest in philosophy, metaphysics, and ultimate questions has increased more and more.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   Vision with real elements (the hair), which occurred in a non-testable way.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  Everything that happened immediately before, during, and right after the event has remained markedly stamped on my memory more intensely than other events around the same time.  

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain     It has happened that I can foresee highly detailed facts about the immediate future like people's illness and death, a friend's flat tire (I told him in advance what day that flat would happen, and similar facts, etc.  Maybe it is just coincidence,  I wouldn't know.  
  
Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The fact that there is awareness outside of my brain, that I am not just my body, and the feeling that I have lived in a positive dimension outside my body.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Starting in my childhood, it all seemed normal until I learned at school that our thinking is constructed of matter, cells, molecules, electrochemical signals – and all this clashed with my experience and my way of thinking about people.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably not real      My mom said I had simply seen my aunt under water, and I believed her.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     The vision as I experienced it could not have occurred under water from my physical viewpoint, but outside of my body in an overhead position and not through my eyes of flesh.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         There remains my disappointment that I can't manage to remember exactly what that wondrous dimension consisted of, about which I had only the feeling that I had really lived it.  I remember only the fragments of the experience outside of my body, but it is assuredly more.
