  		              		Experience Description   

    JULY 10, 2020

  My experience happened like flicking off a switch.  One moment I was sitting on a wall and the next moment, I was moving through a meadow or field. At least that’s how I recall it. It was very bright and I was as relaxed as I have ever been. I felt peaceful, safe, calm, serene, secure, stress-free, a sense of wellness and joy, Happiness, heightened awareness, clarity, and much more. Then, I found myself floating in cool, refreshing water. The water was  flowing around my body. My son had his arm under my head and two other people were in the water next to me. I immediately knew that I had fallen 40-feet. Yet, I had somehow landed, with minimal damage, into the stream below the wall where I had passed out. My first words to my son Matthew were, ‘How is your mother?’ 
  
  One of the most amazing things to me is that I had passed out probably due to a combination of the highly, humid heat from a 93F degree climate  and the exertion of walking up so many steps on an empty stomach and being a bit dehydrated. These conditions were the  perfect combination for heat stroke. 

  Incidentally,  the best thing to do for someone with heat stroke is to cool them off as quickly as possible by immersion in cool water. Without immediate intervention to lower body temperature, heatstroke can cause the brain and other vital organs to swelland possibly result in permanent bodily damage or death. 
  
  When I opened my eyes while floating in the stream, the sense of peace and well-being were still with me. I felt no shock or adrenalin rush; just calmness and clarity. I did a quick check of my limbs and found no apparent damage other than a bit of stiffness and a scrape on the top of my head. I told my son and the others that I was fine.  I told them that I could sit or stand and even walk out of there. They insisted that I remain still until the rescue people arrived. Altough I remained still, I  told them the rescue crew was  not needed. My son told me I was in shock. I calmly told him that I knew what shock felt like  and that I was not experiencing it. 
  
  I wish I had a better grasp of my experience. I was not clinically dead. My son rushed down to where I was lying face down in the water. He said I was flailing or thrashing in the water. I evidently swallowed some water but I don’t think I inhaled any as my lungs seemed clear. He rolled me over as two other people joined him in the water. Within a moment, I opened my eyes.

   I never had any falling sensation. I did not pass through a tunnel, nor did I meet or converse with anyone. I was just suddenly ‘there.’ I only had a brief moment in time to appreciate where ‘there’ was. It seemed to be a beautiful place. There is a haze or blur to my memory. I felt that I was outdoors in sunlight but it was not hot. I was so comfortable and would have been more than willing to have remained right there. My body may have been unconscious but my mind was very much sensing this new and wonderful environment. If it was a dream, it was unlike any dream that I have ever had. When it does come my time to die, I hope to return to this place. I would like to  experience and to see to what it was and where it leads. 
  
  I was strapped to a backboard and carried to an ATV, which took me to an ambulance. I was transported  to the local hospital. Inside the ambulance, they checked my vitals. I repeated that I could sit up or stand, and even walk out. But they told me that I was probably experiencing an adrenalin rush. I told them I was not have an adrenalin rush, nor was I  in shock. Once they took my vitals, they agreed with me. At the hospital, they unstrapped me and let me sit up. Then I stood up.   I  balanced on one foot. At 71 I am in fairly decent shape. The Male nurse that was checking me out, asked if I wanted an MRI. I said I didn’t think it was needed and he agreed. They got the paperwork done and within 30 minutes, I was walking out to the parking lot to join my son and wife. 
  
  My life has not changed. I am the same person I was prior to the fall, but my faith is stronger. I have accepted Christ long ago. I try to live a good and useful life. Was my experience because of faith or because of good works? Or would it have been the same without those things in my life? That is impossible for me to say.

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes.  Accident.          Life threatening event, but not clinical death.  I passed out and fell 40 feet into a gorge with a shallow stream running through it.

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        Normal consciousness and alertness.

  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         My consciousness seemed normal during the experience and when I came out of it. I did not experience any confusion but knew immediately what had happened to me when I opened my eyes in the water.

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         No

  Did you see an unearthly light?         Uncertain   I felt outdoors and a lot of light, such as bright day. I'm not sure if that qualifies as unearthly light.

  What is your religion now?         Christian- Other Christian.   I am a conservative but not fundamental Christian  
  
  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I tend to be a positive-thinking person. This was a higher level of thinking than that. Being human, there are always some negative feelings,  issues, stress, or concern.  But none of that was part of or present in this experience.  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         No

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Uncertain     It was so peaceful there. I suppose that a feeling of love or its expression was a part of the experience.  
  
  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Slight changes in my life.     It is difficult to gauge the degree of change since I have generally been a caring person, I donate blood, volunteer time at the SPCA and Scouts, am involved with pro-life activities and I like people. I may be a bit more tolerant now but I was pretty tolerant and caring prior to my fall.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I told my son that I had that experience while waiting for the backboard.  
  
Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Just that I believe that the 'next life' will be a lot better than this one. I'm still not overly anxious to get there as I do enjoy my kids and grandchildren and I do feel that there is still purpose in my life.  
  
  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I told a few people. Two of them thanked me for sharing. With the whole covid thing, I don't get out to talk with folks too much. I will probably share more when things get back to normal.  
  
  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Uncertain.   I had heard of it and had read a few reports over the years  but never dwelt on it.  
  
  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     It was  totally different from anything that I had ever encountered in my life.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     It doesn't fade. It is a part of me, a part of who I am.  
  
Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Yes
