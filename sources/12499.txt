I just rested; a peace I never felt before came over me. I saw a bright light through the water and didn't want to get up. It seemed like a long time. A voice said, 'You have to get up before another wave comes.' I got up and walked out without any wave hitting me. I made a decision to live and realized I was not finished here. It was an overcast day without sun.

Years later, at least fifteen, that type of water and weather brought me to the ocean again where I helped a baby from drowning.  It was a toddler who was sitting on the shore and was picked up by the water and pulled into the ocean. No one saw it happening but, me.
