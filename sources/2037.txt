It has always beewa question how far tiinaticism or im,-
posture could 0; and to what extent credulity might bc
eiercised? _
It [has always' been a question, how much real
crime may be mixed with sincere, but mistaken piety, and
how Str the human character is susceptible of being at once

C »

an operator on the credulity of others? Philosophers have
oilen sought the point where fanaticism ends, and knavory
begins, and to what extent fanaticism may set aside the
most established code of morals in their own persons, while
in others not operated on
by the same spirit, the would con-
demn in the most absolute terms; in het, when men do
wrong in the name of God, it becomes a matter of real in~
terest to know the motives which prompt to the wrong, or
the cause from which it flows.
M In this point of view, the subject becomes one of moral
philosophy, alike interesting to the present, generation and
toposterity; and for this we think the whole truth, and no-
thing but the truth, should be laid before the public.
On this subject, acheap pamphlet, without name or _uu-
ihoritg;
and an
expensive book, with a res table name,
ernbo yin the report of one of the parties, ge been pub-
lished: Vge pronounce both false! the one
evidently got
up upon hearsay evidence, the other designedly omzttmg
the most curious parts of the subject, apparently because
those parts impugned the party writing, and garbling and
perverting much of the remainder; the facts are purposely
distorted, the names omitted, and the whole calculated to dae-
ceive-to convey a false impression; and, consequently,
unfit to afford a safe data on which to reason.
I We propose to give names, dates, places, and facts, with-
out reserve, the subject requires it! and our research and
_industry will enable us to do this. Delicacy of language
will be observed as far as the subject will admit of; but we
have to treat of the assumption of
sseiapernatural power in
'more than one case, uneleanness, uction, and adultery,
committed in the name of the Lord; with reciprocal'
charges of something like murder and theft, among the
party, who are still serving the Lord with
apparent
since-
rity. Their sincerit we shall not
dispute,
ut we shall
'confine ourselves to the facts, the proof o the ducts. and tlie-

Vc shall divide the work into two pnrtshirst, A narrative
of`fu£:is,`e?nbracing a review of Mr. VV. L., Stone's "Mat-
thias and--his Impostures," and, second, A portrait of the
parties composing the society at Sing-Sing, in which vari~
ous' detaiilsi "amusing, interesting, and important, will be
given, which would break too much into the simple nar-
mtive.
We merely add, that in publishing this work, we do it
upon our onm
responsibility; we have no prejudice in fa-
vour of any of the party; we have made no
promise to
suppress or
keep back any point, unfavourable to our com-
munieants; on the contrary, we have endeavoured to obtain
the whole truth. and avowed our determination to publish
it; we are under no control, promise, or obligation. On
reading Mr. Stone's book, we were satisfied that he had
suppressed the truth, and we resolved to publish it, if we
could obtain it: perhaps our remarks in the Citizen of the
World led to the qpplication of a
gentleman on the part of
Isabella, vho declnred, in consequence of her evidence be-
ing suppressed in the trial at Vhite Plains, and in conse-
quence of misrepresentation at that trial before the grand
jury; and in consequence ofthe errors in Mr. Stone's book,
and of the invectives against her, she was desirous of tell-
ing the whole truth. Our reply was, bring her here imme-
diately, we wish to publish the whole truth : the gentleman
added, "You may rely upon her statements, for she has
repeated the story at different times, to different ersons in
my family, and in parts, and never varied;"` he also added,
that in the parts of her narrative which agreed with Stone's
book, he found her correct, and where she differed, she was
consistent, while the book was not; in that there were

any gaps and inconsistencies, these were made el¢< hy;

this we might give him credit for benevolence, if not ho-
nesty, were it not that he meanly attempts to transfer the
sins of thosehe has taken under his protection, to others,
not of those crimes; but, unfortunately, poor, uned-
ucated, and coloured. He could expect no defence from a-
Yoman, formerly a slave incapable of reading or writing,

with another black woman, named Katy, was attached to

because they will both come conspicuously before the read-

speak to him in an Omnibus in Wall street:
IAIIATIVE Ol' llllll-LA. Q
"Aher a special conversation with Mrs. B. Folger, in
which he stated the object of the meeting, she also consent-
qd to attend.
"Assembled round the bedside of Mrs. Pierson, now evi~
Gently near her end, Mr. Pierson quoted the passage from
James, heretofore referred to, and urgedthat it was indis-
pensable to the recovery of his wife that he should literally
51151 that injunction. He had called the elders of the
ehutclx together, and she must be anointed. Arrangement;
were
accordingly made for that ceremony. Among the
persons
present on the occasion, were Mrs. "", and the
lack woman Isabella, who was very forward and active.
According to the impressions of persons in the adjoining
apartment, who were too much shocked by the procedure to
be present, Isabella must have been one of the principal
actors and
sgkers
in the religious rites and ceremonies
that were o rved. The filet of the anointing is bxieily
noted in the diary of Mr. Pierson, thus :--
Hnda , June 23, 1830. Anointed Sarah with oil, in the
name of the Lord, according to James v. 14, l5."
What are we to make of this passage, Mrs. Folger was
pzesent,
it is expressly stated; she wrote part of this book,
rnarne would not have been mentioned as the person
"especially consulted," without her consent, Isabella is
pointed out as being "
very forward, must have been one.of
the principal actors,"
yet
Isabella was Nor present, upon
the testimony of Isabe la herself] eonjirmecl by Mrs. Pier-
son's daughter, who was
present and has expressly given us
this confirmation. What now are we to think of this apps.-
rest combination of Mrs. Folger and Mr. Stone, to attach to
a
poor, coloured, unlettered woman, this

=
After the death of Mrs. Pierson, an attempt was `rnade to
pray
her to life, and at thefuncrnl, even an attempt of 'this
ind was there made; lsabellai was not there then upon the
testimony of Mrs. Bishop, the cousin _of Mr. Pierson, who
expressly gave us this information, and who knows the time*
at which Isabella came to Mr. Pierson, which was not till i
alter he had removed to 4th street, and aher Mrs. *""
had l
ceased to keep house for him: so much, we
again say, for
the honesty or
ability of Mr. Stone, as a narrator of facts,
thus disproved by the most respectable testimony, while we
have yet other testimony equally strorig to the same' eH`ect:
but proof is proof additions would be superfluous.
We can show equally false statements on the part of M11
{
Stone, in relation to the 'earlyhistqry of Matthias, upon 'the
evidence ofthe wife of 'Matthias from whom we have _ob
J
tained the confirmation of important facts within her know-
1edge~:'but we have preferred selecting a few of thoselin re-
lation to Isabella, because' these extracts show a
design to
injure tha,t-woman, or to
destroy her credibility: for the
very opposite reason we have taken some
pains to ascertain
the personal, character of Isabella, and before we lay her
testimony before the public, we wish to show what confi-
dence was placed in her by those families in which she lived
.from her womenhood or even childhood, and it shows no
small share of sensibility to a £1ir fame, on her part, when '
we inform our readers, that on our
expressing rt
wish_to l
know her character previous to her connexion' with Mr.
'
Pierson, Matthias, or Folger, she thrust into our
bands a
l
lot of papers containing written characters from a
rcgtilar
succession of her -employers, even from the time of her A
slavery; these papers will speak for themselves, anflwc

fonoe law that a great deal depended on that, and
weginvestignted it thoroughly, and weighed well the accl-
aalionl- and the evidence against her. We have before laid
'that on all important subjects, we have collateral evidenceof
the most respectable character. These we shall bring br-
ward to establish those great points; but the development
of character is shown in little things-manners. expressions,
ands incidental or designed conversations, &,c., &.c., for which
there may be no collateral evidence, and the truth of which
will depend on
theconsistency of the development andlcha-
racter of the narrator. Had we found Isabella a
silly,
worthless being, known for foolish or wicked lies, one m
Whom no confidence could be placed; and had wo found she
varied in her statements at different times, and to diH`er~
fem' people, ,We would have thrown up our
design, or
pub-
lished only what had other testimony; but our investigation
has terminated in a conviction of her honesty, and we mud:
lay part of this evidence before the public. _ ,
;
Llln the progress of Mr. Stone's book, we find the AB-
EENCE of all evidence that Isabella was the most wicked
of-the wicked; but instead of which, there is the blackber-
ry story preceding Mr. Picrson's death. the poisoning thg
coffee story, on the alleged morning of Matthias' departure,
(reallybn the morning belbre.) and Mrs. B. Folger's illness,
(rriarlt this;) and the suspicion declared that she and Mab-
thiashad appropriated 'property not their own; for which
I0 evidence was ever given. The property story inwivu
an' important subject; Mr. Pierson did possess $80,000,.ll

"Mn Piersoxfs sickness, which terminated in his death,
oonrmenced on the afternoon of Tuesday, July 29, 1834.
The evening-say twenty-lbur hours-before, he ate
freely
of some blackberries, picked by Matthias and his youngest
#OIL and repared with sugar tor the teble, us is supposed,
by the coloured woman. The persons at the table at the
time were Mr. Pierson, Mrs. Folger, Catherine, und Mat-
lhias. The latter served out the blackberries at that time, as
he invariably did every description of food at the meals. He
helped Mr. Pierson, Mrs. Folger, and Catherine, to the
berries, but none to himself Mr. Pierson ate two ordinary
sizcddvsscrt plates full 1 Ffntlrorino one: Mrs. Folger rusted
of them; remarked that they were not rtbctl ripe and
sweet; and, owing to the state of her healtlfwhichhad been
feeble ihr
many years, declined them, lest they should disa-
gree with her.
'
It will be remembered, that Mr. Pierson died of fits, to
which he was accustomed, and that this blackberry fean
preceded Mr. _Pierson's lust illness twenty-four hours, and
was held in July 28, 1834. On the next clay, inthe ener-
noon, as related in the book, page 134, he was
hay making,
and picking and eating blnckberries; that is, just previous
to his fit, and to his purging and puking, which he
brought u blaclrberries,

to be poison-

It appears that Mr. and Mrs. Pierson, assisted by some of
the clergy and other persons, had most, benevolently esta-
blished tt Magdalene Asylum; that Mrs. Pierson»and_oiher
ladies frequently visited the Fire Points, and, other similar
places, to make converts, and supply the Asylum; f,jO£ this
Asylum, a Mrs. Carpentvr*(now Mrs. h1'I)owtdl,)§-was at
one time Matron-~a lady of whom we know nothing,-one
cept that she was
rexpected where known ;, but s,he~,§'as

this time he thought highly of Now M Bolton. -besides
the qualities which we have already mentioned, Irpptllitmtly
possessed a

in seducing mcnf and 'had received large sums of _money

before the time of Mrs. Bolton's matronship, yet the inform-
ation given was just such as
persons in her situation could
give ; and the errors committed, and exaggerations rhxtt!'t£'j£
lu¢h as we might expect, from persons whosepresént méii
was rated in proportion to the.r former vices. Mrs. Boltégh
had been an exact specimen of corruption, in a
pleasing
unsuspicious form; and her practices, on her own
showirig,
if believed, those which would justify the assertion in
Magdalene Report, that women were
generally the seduceisi
and perhaps there were many Mrs. Bolton's about the esta.-
blishment. As prooll liowever, ofthe humility oi' this lady
she used to wash the feet of Isabella, who in return washed
her's, as part of the religious duty then thought necessary
lb Mr. Pierson. '
yAt this period, Mr. Pierson was in the habit of preaching
in his own house, and Mrs. Bolton may be remembered as
going about the city soliciting hearcrs to the Prophet Elijah,
or John the Baptist, (Mr. Pierson, and delivering religious
tracts, with extraordinary zeal, an 'thus obtaining a
degree
of public notoriety, and accession to houses under her ap~
parent character, and whose residents might not have es-
teemed her, in proportion to her forms-r course, ns Mr. Pier-
_son did.
Among the attendants on Mr. Pierson's preaching, and
indeed among his friends, was Mr. Mills. In page 96 of
Mr. Stone's book, we have an account of Mr. Mills, under
the letters M. H. S. which was almost unnecessary, as his
eonnexion with Matthias was notorious. The account of
his previous impressions are
probably correct; we see no
inconsistencies, nor_ any object to be obtained in falsifving.
His history is that ol' many, very many fanatics; heielt a
deep conviction of sin, and made himself miserable under
tho idea that he had offended Deity, beyond tha: hope df
Epson
To divert him. he travelled over land to New Or-
s; he afterwards visited England, Ireland, the British
and French capitals, and retumed to New York in 1831,
very little altered; yet he became a member of the
Presby-
terian church, was regular in his' devotions, and fervent in
prayer, using ejaculatory prayer frequently; and with much

subject of religion on the clorln uc-
gpaintances
in his store; prudently, however, begging his
'ends to check him when hewas going too far in his store
exhortations. In the spring of 1832, he became acquainted
with Mr. Pierson, and soon formed an attachment to him'
and being informed that Mr. Pierson was not considered
'quite right in his mind, he replied, says Mr. Stone, °'
Oh, it
is not so now." The impression of Mr. Pierson's sanity,
among the party, we find to be general, notwithstanding a
Tewvcry singular acts, such as
anointing his sick wife, and
expecting her resurrection; yet in this he relied on his un-
derstanding of scripture. It is evident that Mr. and Mrs. B.
Folger received their doctrines chiefly from Mr. Pierson,
and regarded him as
perfectly sane; even on the late trial,
Mrs B. Folger conveyed that idea.
'
We see no reason to doubt the outlines of thc early history
of Mr. and Mrs. Folger, as given by Mr. Stone The 0011*
'version of Mrs. Folger, whohad been brought up in the
'bosom of the Dutch church, took place in 1825, two years
after her marriage; and in the same year was formed what
-was commonly called the Holy Club, the essence of which
was Mrs. ""', (so says Mr. Stone.) who-is said to have in~
'dluenc the mind of Mrs. Folger, but the credit ofthe con-

_ 'V 'is given to the Rev. Mr. Dubois. Previousto this
i 'eh of societies had been formed, of which Mrs. ""
is said to have been the focus; but against her Col. Stone is
*evidently prejudiced, for he wishes to transfer to
that lady
a
great portion of the sins of Mrs. Folger, as the original
cause of her fanaticism, while the sequel evidently shows,
that however zealous Mrs. '"
might bc, she did not itll

into rsonal guilt, and would have saved Mrs. Fo] er from

'tion _of Male land female zealots was

beibre mentioned, for mutual instruction and pra er; ibut
those dinly were to
speak who were moved byftlie Holy
-Ghost, or who thoug t

'
This association
afterwards called the Holy' ub. Mr. Stone says they did
not believe in the special observance of the Sabbath, but that
every day should be alike. He likewise says, they did not
believe in the institution of marriage, and that a
single life
was essentialto purity; however, man of these then sin le,
afterwards got married; they did not iielieve in a final a
of
judgment,
but that mankind were judged of their deed;
every y. We have not, however, perfect confidence' in
Mr. Stone's statements. It was this society that Mrs.'B.
Folger associated with after her conversion, and to whom
she opened her house, and these
proceedings
were simulta-
neous with Mr. Pierson's
apreaching
in 's own house.
Mrs "', of Stone's book, erwards removed to
Bowery
Hill, lately cut down, attracting to her neighbourhood Mr.
Pierson, Mr. and Mrs. B. Folger, and others, forming a so-
ciety, who believed themselves under the teaching of the
Spirit; the source, we again repeat, of all fanaticism. Here
the Retrenchment Society was formed, and Mr. Folger, un-
der the influence of his wife, disposed of his elegant furni-
ture in town, and replaced it with
*plain
furniture at
Bowery
Hill; the partook of plain ood only,
abstainigg
even
kom butter, tea, and coffee, while the ladies sacrific their
ornaments, personal as well as household, and even institu-
ted rigid fasts, not to
precede a feast, as among Catholics, to
which it serves as a whet tothe appetite; but, to be broken
by bread and water. Mr. Stoneadds, that Mr. Folger, not-
withstanding the sacrifice ofhis furniture, was not a member
of this society. We must now

Mr. Pierson carried his principles further than the NK.
but hevhad no principles that were not common to others, if
not to all; for others believed in the direct teaching of the
Spirit, and these mistook their feelings for the effects of the
Spirit, andtheir transient thoughts for emanations from the
Spirit ; and being thus enlightened according to their leisure.
and to the
encouragement they gave to their thoughts and
itncies. they could equently see farther than
othernpeople
into the Scriptures and the will of God, or fanci they
could; and Mr. Pierson possessed these qualities in a su-
perlative degree, and was hence highly
respected by the
party, while the world thought him a little eranged; but
on all subjects disconnected with religion, or where he did
not assume being divinely taught by Scripture, or the Spirih
he was very rational and intelligent. He kept a sort of
diary, and hence we learn, when he received what he thought
a communication from the S irit in Wall, Street, that he wal
then called Elijah the Prophet; and this took place before
he had seen Matthias
Among other s ecimens of Mr. Pierson's diary, Mr. Stone
himishes the folllowing, which We offer as a proof of the
importance ho gave his thoughts:-
°'
Prayed for the harlots at Five Points: asked the Lord
to give us all the ground whereon the soles of our feet had
trod, and all the souls now alive who had heard our voices
in that neighbourhood
"
Answer. The Lord said, 'You must go and fetch them
out' The Lord said, concerning the two witnesses, °
Thou
art one and Sarah the other.'

We have already noticed Mr. Stone's gross error in ascri-
hing to Isabella a put. and a very prominent part, in "tho
kingdom." as it WHS
technically called, on
Bowery Hill, be-
fore either she or Matthias was connected with the party-
llr. Pierson had assumed the title of Prophet, asserting thsi

he understood as meaning the gathering of his friends at
-Bowery Hill; and Mrs. Bolton, beibre noticed, with much
.nal went about the city and into churches distributing tracts,
and inviting the people-to °'
come and hear Elijah the Pro-
phet." Before Matthias appeared, the anointing had taken
place, in which Mrs. Folger was consulted; and the as
sumetl influence of the S irit over the party believed, and
being led, or supposed to be led, by the Spirit, they pushed
their
mines
with zeal, and projected improvements both
in c and practices; still they were orthodox, zealous
persons, and as such in intercourse with their fellow Chris-
tians. As a
proof
of this, it is noted in page 94 of Mr.
Stone's book, t at aiier the death of Mrs. Pierson, Mr. Pier-,
son and Mrs.

removed from Bowery Hill to Fourth
Street, in one and the same house, while Mr. and Mrs. Fol-
ger went to reside at Sing Sing, and where they were bap-
tized by the Rev. Mr. Frey, and admitted into the fellow~
ship and communion of Mount Pleasant Baptist church. It
was at this period that Isabella went to live with Mr. Pier-
son, (Mrs.
"'
having lell him, and Katy having gone to
Virginia) without any previous knowledge either of himor
Matthias, who soon afterwards followed.
Previous to this period, and indeed before the party left
Bowery Hill. and consequently long before Matthias ap-
peared among them, a transaction occurred which isminuto-
l related by Mr. Stone, ge 114, 15, 16, which indeed we
shall transcribe, which slibws in some a uliar state of
mind, and fitness for what we shall afterward?have to relate,
and which would be scarcely credible, if it were not for the
publication of an original document, in Mr. Stone's work,
md which we could not otherwise have got possession oil
We knew that such a document had an existence: Mr.
Stone, indeed, by taking out the names, excepting that d'

her spirit had entered into the body of the lady referred to.
It is not lmown how, or exactly when. this strange conceit
originated; but it is not more surprising than
many other
features of his melancholy hallucination. Among his loose
papers, however, are two anonymous notes, in the hand-
writing of a female, which, taken in eonnexion with a cir-
cumstance or two that will presentlybe related, render it at
ldst possible, that there may have been an artful conspiracy
at the bottom of this particular instance of delusion. Mrs.
Pierson, it will be recollected, died on the 29th of June,
1830. The following note is endorsed in Mr. Pierson's
handwriting-' Received July 20, l830.' And here it must
he home in mind. that, connected with the idea that his wife
Wouldbe raised from the dead, and restoredto him on earth,
was the farther belie£ that she would bear him a lon. to be
called 'James' This was one of the promises which he
had received from God, and which he has recorded as the

I beheld my cousin walk into your back-door with the dress
which she usually wears. She passed through the entry,
and went into the parlor. The difference in her state was,
that she was big with child; and I thought in the vision
that she was at home* in your house. I knew not the mean-
ing of it, but was constrained to send it to ou. Perha
the Lord will show you the interpretation. if cousin told

abrupt note I handed you. I have felt quite uneasy about
it, and wished to say to you, that after I had the vision. I
thought I must write it; and thought I had better tell it to
you than cousin, as I know she has a
remarkably pure
mind; and I judged that if she suspected that I let you know
(it,] it would make her feel very unpleasant. I have taken
up a cross in making it known to you: if I ha'e.done
wrong, be kind enough to forgive me.'

"
It so, happens that there was a
very remarkable coun-
terpart to this vision of the Writer of these notes. The lady
ssibly referred to, had a vision on a certain night-she
ming at a distance from the city at the time-in which it
was revealed to her, that she was the spiritual' wife of Mr.
Pierson.. And she believed that such was the record in
heaven. This conviction was moreover
strenihxenod by
mother circumstance. On one occasion, her hus d being
lbsent, she rayed very fervently that the first
person
who
entered her door, might be him. It happened s
only after-
1|rd,'and before any other person came in, that Mr. Pier-
son made his appearance; ,und the good lady at once cou-

no doubt was led of the liict; since it
appmred
that on the
self-same night, he had had a similar rea.m in his own
house. On discovering the coincidence tlieyajoinadhancb,
and walking into another apartment, where a third person
was sitting, presented themselves, and mutually declared
'themselves to be, spiritually, man and wife. Whether there
was, or
was not, any connexion between the
mysterious notes
which have been quoted, and this singular incident of the
delusion, is leil for the reader to determine."
"
Now, in the first place, who wrote these notes, to whom
do they relate, and what actions in this mysterious ailiir cor-
res nd \vith these sentiments? Mr. Pierson declared to
Isabglla, that Mother (Mrs. B. Folger) had had a
spirit of
this kind for some time; and that she had declared to him
'that he should have Mrs. --
for a wife. Mrs. B. Folger
:also stated the fhct, that she had communicated this vision to
Mr. Pierson before Father (Matthias) had come, and re-
peated nearly the words of the letter. Mt. Pierson also de-
clared, that Mrs. Folger must be a master spirit, because
she had first discovered this light. Mrs. -1
was a mar-
ried lad _ We have not yet seen her, but 'udging from Mr.
Stone's book alone, we are perfectly satisfied that however
fanatical she may be, she has been
unjustly abused by Mr.
Stone, for the sake -of others less virtuous, or more fa-
natical.
'
Of the supposition that this lady intrigued to get these
notes written in her favour, and the assumed facts that this
lady hada corresponding dream, and that her prayer was
answered by the appearance of Mr. Pierson instead of her
husband, we know nothing. We have detected Mr. Stone
in notorious false statements in relation to Isabella, andthese
therefore may be incorrect, especially asthe subsequent ¢0Il~
duct of that lady does not accord with the facts, as related,
#lid et the thing may be
possible.

'
lwhhn anoteon this subject was at first nientioneil to isa-
bclia, she instantly declared its contents, before it was read
to her, using some ofthe very
extplessions,
and 'immediately
applying them to the history of Sing _Sing mystery. re-
lating where it was first named to her, the occasion, and the
action on it, a long while after. She instantly recognized
the phraseology as being used on another very singular, but
similar occasion, especially the expression, "
If I have done
wrong, be kind enough to for ive me," and imitated the sofi
tone and manner in which lérs. B. Folger would express
herseli It is also true, that her cousin was of a remarka-
ble ure mind.
'
Flint the sake of connecting this subject with facts, we
shall now
anticipate the history of events, in relation how-
ever onlyto Mr. Pierson. This
gentleman,
,at a
subseguent
period, and while the parties, inc uding Matthias, resi ed at
Sing Sing, and alter' some
very singular events had occup-
red there, of which he was made a
party, and of which we
shall afterwards speak, applied to this married lady, not for
a spiritual union only. but for a
bodily one; and at this_pe-
riod he related the facts of the note to Isabella, and repeated
to her the contents,
explaining!
the propriety of such unions.
For this purpose he went to t e residence of that lady, and
fomnally proposed the union, declaring both to the hus-
band and the wife, that hehad a' revelation from'God, that
marriage was not 'of God, and that he was to take Mrs. --
Ear his wife. This formal application both the husband and
the
lady regarded as the act of a mad man, and treated it
accordingly.
This occurred about two months before Mr.
Pieraods eath; but he had frequently named the subject
bdrm, but tlelieately, as a dream, and ,onlyurging the lady
to come on a visit to Sing Sing, trusting to the power of
Hatthias to etliect the rest. Thi the lady had named to her
lfland. while she declined the visit, never there but

tion to a married woman, strange ns it is, is attest-A by Mr.
Piorson's relatives, from some of whom We have the cor-
roborative evidence ; nor do we believe the lady will disavow
the fact; she has nothin' to be ashamed of: she was not
duped by Matthias, nor id she tolerate, for a moment, the
preposterous proposition made to her. It is for this reason
we doubt the tiicts formerly related of her. _The curious
circumstances which led to this monstrous proposition, be~
sides the notes, a long while previous, will he related in their
properplaces, and will, in some rmxcusure, reduce the sur-
prise. Ve speak, however, posilifve on the fact of Mr. Pier-
son making such an
application to the lady before mention-
ed, and we know that this fact is known to his relatives, who
are also now
living; we have not asked their leave to give
them as a reference, for tear they should be alarmed at the
publication, and attempt to _induce us to suppress it. The
excuse for him, is of course his insanity; and if others, with
orvwithout visions, have made similar applications, and suc-
ceeded, they must invent their own excuses: we shall pub-
lish facts; the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
'
We have thus anticipated the history, in order to identity
the author and object of those notes; and we do not hesitate
to say, that in our belief; Mrs. B. Folger is the author, and
Mrs. -_
the object; but these notes were written in 1830,
two years before Matthias or Isabella was known to the
party, and consequentl proves o.
peculiar state of mind on
the part of Mrs. B. Foilger, in relation to the marriage con-
tract, by no moans uncommon
among some religious people.
The Antinomiuns of England were
frequently charged by
their opponents with violations of the marriage compact;
while we have known some of them justify lcnvhg their
husbands or wives, because they were not spiritual. und
quoting Scripture, as,
"
Be ye not unequolly yoked." It must
be Observed 100, that Mr. Pierson believed in the transmi-
gration of spirits; he supposed that his wii`e's amiable spirit
had taken up its abode with Mrs. --, while that lady's
husband, however excellent a man he may be as a citizen,
never made any great pretention to spirituality; and there-
fore Mr. Pierson, advised bg others, might think the lady
4

unmatched. Clergymen who have not been considered de-
ranged, have held similar opinions, and acted in a like man-
ner, from fanaticism, united perhaps with lust.
Nowlet any persons regard the consequences of these
sentiments, apparently expressed by Mrs. B. Folger and Mr,
Pierson: the teaching of the Spirit, which means
any emo-
tion or
thought, in accordance with what we think Scripture,
including dreams and visions, a
supposed holy community
or selected favourites of God, together with the belief of
spirits, good or bad, successively occupying bodies; and
you have, in these sources of fanaticism, the seeds of all the
mischief ascribed to Matthias; and these existed before he
made his appearance. We are not about to excuse him, or
take one particle from his shoulders which he ought to bear ;
but we have set out with a candid determination to investi-
gate the whole subject, and we are resolved to do justice to
every individual. In relation to those notes, we should be
unwilling to ascribe them either to design by Mrs. -_, or
by Mrs. B. Folger: we sec no reason, without very strong
evidence to the contrary, to deny that Mrs. B. Folger had a
vision, and believing in such visions as the effect of the
Spirit, we are not surprised at the result. All we want is
to give the facts, and to show their causes and necessary
results)
In the above narrative we have omitted the lady?s name, (as an.
exception
to our general rule,) we think her perfectly innocent;
we t ink both she and her husband have been severel injured bythe
base insinnation of Colonel Stone, and we should oniy increase that
injury by giving publicity to the name: there are some crimes of so
degradinga nature, that humanity shrinks from the association of
the name with the crime, even if no proof can be alle d ; the crime

'Such then were the feelingsand faith, and such the din-

Hrtthias came. We shall now introduce this important
gentleman .
Pierson; and that on another occasion she prayed to see her hub
had who had been absent, and that Mr. Pierson
presented
himself
accidentally- that discovering the coincidence wit n dream ol' Mr.
Pierson on the same night, they joined hands, walked into another
a rtment, and presented themselves as spiritual man and wife."
'lpgere is in this account a peculiar caution which we overlooked at
int; we had supposed the
grescntntion
was to a company, instead of
which, upon recurring to t e boolr, we find it was to athird person
or indimfiual; thus this tale of infamy rests on an
individual, and
that individual we believe to be a degraded one, to be tn fact, Mr.
or Mrs. Folger, both of whom,
together
with Mrs. Stone the lady
with
glumes
in her hat, introduce in Mr. Stone's book, have been
oifen ed with the candour and honesty of this victimized
ladii;
we
mention this as n fact not as the motives for adastardly in `ction
of a rancorous wound, for it does not appear a. suliicient cause for
this
vindictihsicourse;
FBconad, howevlerr,
have wished that uopri-
vate cause existed' or suc an attac .
We have now seen this lady and her husband, we find in her
nothing fanatical, but a great deal of
§ood sense, and a very lively
sense of propriety. The
testimony o
Mrs. B. Folger to her that
she has a remarkably pure mind, ts verilied by others who ltnovr
her ; while she denies ever holding the peculiarity of Mr. Pierson's
creed about marriage, or any other of his peculiar opinions, such
as the direct teaching of the
sggit,
Gro. She at once recognized this
'note as Mrs. B. F'olgcr's, th Mr. Pierson and Mrs. B. Folger
had spoken to her on the subject, and that to the latter she had replied,
"
Well, cousin, n dream is but a. dream." The mention of the sub-
ject by the former, only created o more distant or circumspect inter-
course, so that she does not recollect even shaking hands with him
niterwnrds, while he in his general department
atppeared
modest:
his invitations to Sing-Sing, she then regarded as nendly, intended
for her
stgitual benefit, and were declined by her because she
regarded atthinsasan tmpostor, exclaiming "I will not visit at

ledge of which, without
seeing
the lady, we draw our conclusions
as to the vileness of the slan er, and the probable lhlseness of the
Of counterpart, this
lady
knows nothing; she utterly denies
it, and throws it back as a. ase fabrication on the author, or
his informer, or as a concoction of both; or it might have been
mother dream of the author of the first dream; but Col. Stone has
siren currency to this counterpart, without proof, just as slandercrs
o who wish to believe a statement detrimental to an object of dis-
}iutre. i
This
hal?
then denies ever having, or relating a. corresponding
dream to r. Pierson; she denies recognizing the coincidence and
'liking hand and hand into another apartment, and presenting her-
lelf to 3 third person, or being so presented as the spiritual wife of
Hr. Pierson- she denies the prayer and the incident of Mr. Pierson
coming in alier that prayer, although he might have come in atler
such 1 prayer, (a prayer for her husband at variance with the sup-
gidon
of betraying him) without her observation. Now then is
L Stone put to his
trumps,
he must bring his respectable
proofs
of
these facts, or be regnrde as a base slanderer of a respecta le, well
educated, talented, und virtuous female, one described by Mrs. B.
Fo] er as "of a remarkably pure mind."
'lslmt we are correct in our object, the facts connected with the
letter show; nay, Mr. Stone himself identities her, but this we can-
not show without giving the name; we will however give Colonel
Stone proofs of identity :-this lady is the cousin of Mrs. B. Folger,
lathe note itself intimates, she was the early friend of Mrs. Stone,
md. member of the same church, and she did offend Mrs. Stone on
thembject of het' peacock like
ncppearance
in church; her husband
was known to Mr. Stone at Hu son, in his earliest exertions and
honest endeavours to raise himself from poverty: at that time, her
lmsbnnd was a man ol' good thmily, fortune, and education, he was
on the ground when Col. Stone, not then a colonel, was selling his
lent dying speech and confession of Peg Hultail, (Peggy Hou htztil-
ing, executed for infanticide,) before that miserable fema§e had
drawn her Inst breath; he knows the history of that pamphlet, and
he wasarm in arm with Lieut. Allen, on the morning alter that gen-
tleman had nearly choaked Mr. Stone, who in a drunken frolic,
altar a hall, at which they had all been, had called the Lieutenant a
onward; he was present we say at the reconciliation, and heard the
Lieutenant say, "Well, Mr. Stone,
ifggu
are satisiled, I am."
Theeefaets are mentioned to assure Col. ne, that we are correct
in our information; and now we may add, that the
highlyindig-
nent husband is
only restrained from ofering a
public insu t to t e
'dillerer of his wife, from the fear of the press, over which his
antagonist would have a control from his situation; and if Colonel
Que in not now
satisned, we are authorized to soy, that this gentle-
_
name and address is at our otlice, andat Col. Stones senate,
_
gy purpose he
may choose. , _

Wm propose to give only a sketch of the life of Matthias
in this place, because Mrs. Matthias, we understand, is pub-
lishing on this subject; and her work will be the best au-
thority for his early life, unless it shows marks of prejudice,
while we believe that our work will be the best authority
for that period of his life utter he left his home in Albany,
and appeared amongst us as n
prophet, and took up his
abode successively with Mr. Pierson, rn Fourth-street; with
Mr. Mills in Franklin-street; at his own house in Clarkson
street, and finally at Mr. Folger's in Sing Sing, because we
take our
nsrrative from a living witness, with him during
all that time, sufliciently shrewd for. careful observation,
and too simple in character and defective in education' to
conceal the truth, even if she desired it, and sudiciently in-
jured by the declarations of Mr. Folger, and the publication
of Mr. Stone's book, to seek a

'
s
'lhbsrt Matthews, or Matthias, is of Scotch extraction, but

age; he was religiousl brought* up
llllllf the Anti-Burghers, a sect _

any regular apprenticeship,
mdzshowed Jconsidersble mechanical skill; but he never
didnt as a mill-wright, as stated by Mr. Stone, as we are

influence of the blessing which he received at the hand Of
the Scotch clergyman; the preaching of Mr. Finney ands
Mr. Kirk, seems to have assisted in forming his charadd,
for after hearing him, he declared that though he had

them: he did not however become a follower of eitherof
them, but they gave a new direction to his thoughts. Bebrs
his late appearance as a public character he advocated en-
thusiastically the abstinence system as to liquor, and enforced
it in his family.
'
In 1829 he was well known, if not for street
preaching,
for loud discussions and pavement exhortations, but he did,
not make set sermons. In the beginning of 1830, he
only considered zealous, but in the same year he prophg-

preparing to shave, with the Bible before him, he suddenly.

that the law of God was the only rule of government, and
that he .wastcommanded to take possession of the world it

his wife and children since then have chiefly supported
themselves by their own
industry, although he has given
them money when he has had- it. At Ar le he entered
the church and interrupted the minister, decglliring the conl

wasnt' course taken out of the church, and as he-was ad~
vertiaed in the Albany papers; he was sent back to his
hmily. His beard had now obtained a respectable length,
I-hd thus he attracted attention, and easily obtained an au-
dience in the streets; for this he was sometimes arrested,
once by mistake for Adam Paine, who collected the crowd
md then lell Matthias with it on the approach of the officers."
ljle repeatedly urged his wife to accompany him on a mis-
non to convert the world, declaring that food could he ob-

Wwe. At this time he assumed the name of Matthias,
lallsd himself a Jew, and set out on a mission, taking a.
westem course, and visiting a brother at Rochester, a
skilful mechanic, since dead; leaving his brother he pro-
needed on his mission over the northern states, occasionally
returning to Albany, but he did not visit Arkansas, nor the
nouth, nor the Cherokee country in Georgia, as Mr. Stone
nys, nor, of course, did he preach to the Indians, nor was
he imprisoned there, all of which is reported by Mr. Stone,
who apparently confounds him with Adam Paine, whose
Irperience was something like this, but he did visit Wash-

between Matthias and Mr. Pierson on Saturday, hurried
her work, got Enished, and was rmitted-to be present ;
indeed the sameness of belief mad): her familiar with her
employer, while her attention to her work, and characteris-
tic faithfulness, increased his confidence. This intimacy,
the result of holding the same faith, and the rinciple after-
wards adopted of having hut one table and, all things in
common, made her at once the domestic and the equal, and
the depository of very curious, if not valuable information;
to this object even her colour assisted: persons who have
travelled in the south knowthe manner in which the coloured
people, and especially slaves, are treated, they are scarcely
regarded as being present; this trait in our American char-
acter has been frequently noticed by foreign travellers.-
One English lady remarks that she discovered in course of
conversation with a southern married
gentleman, that a co-
loured girl slept in hisbedroom, in which also wus his Wife,
and when he saw thatit occasioned some surprise, he re~
marked "What would he do if he wanted a glass of water
in the night Z" Other travellers have remarked that the pre-
sence of coloured people never seemed to interrupt conver-
sation of any kind for one moment; thus the peculiar religious
and other characteristics of Isabella, gave opportunities
which none other had, and circumstances have induced her,
nay rendered it necessa that she should keep back
nothin?
but to tall the whole truiih,which was the only way in whic
she could escape the position of a
scape-ioat,
which Mr.
Stone and some of the party seemed to ma e her; this
_di-
version is not out of place, it accounts tor much information
on the subject which she
possessed,
while her consistency
has won our credence, an her good character and corro-
borative evidence has continued it Isabella then was
pre-
sent at the lirst interview between Matthias and Pierson;
at this interview Mr. Pierson asked Matthias if he hada

they held the same sentiments. both admitting the direct in~
duence of the Spirit, and the transmissions of spirits from
onebai toanother. Matthias admitted`the'call of Mr. Pidr
son in the Omnibus in Wall Street, which, on this occasion,
he gave in these words: "
Thouart Elijah the Tishbite, id
thou shalt go before me in the spirit and power of Elias, to
repare my way before me." And Mr. Pierson admitted
Rlatthias' call, who completed his declaration on the 20th of
June, Argyle, which, by a curious coincidence, was the
very day on which Pierson had received his call inthe 0m~
nibusf Such singular coincidences have a
powerful effect
on excited minds : from that discovery Pierson and Mat-
thias nejoiced in each other, and became kindred spirits;
Matthias, however, claiming to be the iitther, or to possess
the spirit of the Father-he was God upon earth, because
the spirit of God dwelled in him; while Pierson then un-
derstood that his mission was like that of John the Baptist,
which the name Elias meant. This conference ended with
an invitation to supper, and Matthias and Pierson washed
each other's feet; but washing of feet had been established.
At this first meeting a Shaking Quaker was present, and
Matthias remained over night. On the curious coincidence
nf time_.above referred to, we must remark, that Matthias
declared himself in Albany, in the beginning of June, and
at.Stillwater on the 19th, as Mr. Stone says; and therefore
the expression, completed his declaration, is used; but it is
evident that if Mr. Pierson's call had happened on either of
those previous days, the coincidence would have been more
striking,.and equally asserted.
Mr. Pierson preached on the following Sunday, but after
which, he declined in favour of Matthias, and some of the
party believed that the "
kingdom had then come."
Mr. Stone
gives
the following paper, found among others,
dated ,May 9t ,before the interview just related, which he
supposes fonnedxthe heads of one of Matthias' discourse: it
is þÿW0¥!l,§pI¢5 ¬l*V5Dg,

Before this period, Mr. Mills attended`M1'. Piersoh's lec-
tures; so did Mr. and Mrs. Folger, occasionally a Mr.
Beauman, a
carpenter, Mrs. Bolton, Isabella, and Katy,
who had returned from Virginia, with many others. These
exhorted and gave their experience, before Matthias came,
but not afterwards, as he disapproved of women
-speaking,
Some of these persons very soon became disciples of Mat-
hias, and among them was Mr. Mills, who invited Matthias
,o his house whenever he pleased, ands. circumstance not
generally known soon occurred, which induced Matthias 10
nccept of that gentlemnrfs hospitalit , in exchange ibr that
>f Mr. Picrsoifs. Mr_ Pierson had lvet out part of his lar
iouse in Fourth Street, to a Mr. Sherwood, who used it ig;
t
respectable school. This gentleman was thus brought in
rontact with the party, and hc pnonounced Matthias an im-
iostor; and irritutecl by his language, for perhaps he had
.alled him n devil, he shook himwell, pushed him down on
he sofa, and indignantly pulled his beard.- This circum-
tance. together with Mr. I'ierson's timidity, induced Mat-
hias to go to Mr. Mills`s house.
For some time before this, Katy had returned from Vir-
ginia, as
just stated, where she had visited her children;
nd on her return she lived with Mr; Mills, leaving Isabella
n her former situation ;
by mutual consent, and forgeneral
Onveniencv, Isabella and Katy now? changed places; in

At .Ha Mills's preached frequently, and all
every Sunday, and introduced the curious practice of' provi-
ding a dinner for any of the
comppnywho
chose to stay.
Pierson had before preached all t 'nga common, and Mat-
thias had approved it Matthias, too, taught that the good
things of this life were for enjoyment, and' that the time of
abundance had come; he was not now abstemious, yet he
was not extravagant, except in dress, for which Mr. Pier-f
son was responsible, and afterwards in equipage; he ea!
plain food, but not pies, and drank no wine; he ah!
stain also from rk.
At his house, Mills was served by a man called Gal-
loway, ,a sort of' half disci le. This man died some
mouths
after Mr. Mills's establishment was broken up, leaving a
young widow, Catherine Galloway, afterwards aconspicn-
ous
perscn, without any very distinguishing qualities. We
may remark, in anticipation ofthe history, that Matthiashad
cursed her husband, because, contrary to orders, he' had
opened the door to the ofiicers who arrested him, when
Mills's establishment was broken up. This man's death,
by a troublesome and lingering -disease, following the curse,
strengthened the faith of some of his disciples.
5
We return now to the history of events. Matthias con-
tinued for some time preaching at Mills's, and among his
heaters was Mrs. Drach, an elderly Jewish woman, very
talkative, and very familiar with Matthias, to whom she
would give her
experience, almost the only female' with
whom he was familiar at that time. This is the same Mrs.
Dmch who afterwards .gave evidence against him. The
female relatives of Mr. Mills left his house soon after Mat-
thias came; they would not be his disciples, and he would
not bear rivals. .
e
"
Mr. Stone, in his relation of this part of hishistory, com-
mits a sort of' fraud, for he introduces some finery, such as
beautiful ruiiles, worked night caps, &c. whose proper place
is at an period fixrther on. About this place too,

preaching and sentiments, which he breached

copy from Mr. Stone's work, because
we ,know the gentleman who furnished these specimens, and
they are admitted to accord with Matthias' senti-
ments atthat time.
"- The spirit that built the Tower of Babel is now in the
world-it is the spirit ofthe devil._ The spirit of man never
oes upon the clouds-all who think so are
Babylonians.
The only heaven is on the mirth. All who are ignorant of
truth, are Ninevites. The Jews did not
crucify Christ,-it
was the Gentiles. Every Jew has his guardian angel at-
tending, him in this world. God don't speak through
preachers, he speaks through me, his prophet.
",'John the Baptist] (addressing Mr. Pierson,) '
read the
tenth chapter of Revelations." After the reading of the
chapter, the prophet resumed speaking, as follows:-
"Ours is the mustard-seed kingdom which is to spread
all over the earth. Our creed is truth, and no man can find
truth unless he obeys John the Baptist, and comes clean into
church.
"
All nal men will be saved ; all mock men will be
dimmed. When a person has the Holy Ghost, then he is a
man, and not till then. They who teach women are of the
wicked. The communion is all nonsense: so is prayer.
Eating a nip of bread and drinking a little wine won't do
an good. All who admit members into their church and
auger them to hold their lands and houses-their sentence
ig, '
Depart ye wicked, I know you not.' All females who
lecture their husbands, their sentence is the same. The
lonq of truth are to enjoy all the good things of this world,
and must use their means to bring it about. Every thing
that the smell of woman will be destroyed. Woman is
the ggpsheaf of the abomination of desolation-fnll of
all
kviltry. In n short time the world will take fire and_dr|-

At this period Matthiaswaswell dressedjand we
suppose
visited the Batte
frequently in a dark carriage, for Mr.
Stone says so, anldywe think it probable; but Mr. Stone oes
on to sa , that he was
frequently accompanied by Mr. lgier
son anti his children, and he thus particularizes :
"
He
would take the children b the hand at either side, and thus
with state! tread," &c. lvqow here we detect Mr. Stone in
writing hugely. Mr, Pierson had but two daughters, the
elder, indeed, the daughter of his wife, b a. first husband:
we have seen her, and she ositively declares she never
walked out with Matthias in her life, and never heard hes'
sister say she had, and does not at least know of it, though
then living with her father. It is of no great consequence,
but it shows the inaccuracy of Mr. Stone's facts. Matthias
explains this; it was Mr. Mills's children; (see his book,
page
120.2
Mr. Mi ls, it is known, was arrested for insanity, and his
establishment broken up, but his property saved. We al)
not
suullprised
at the course taken by his friends' it was
per-
hag visable, and the last of the evils prevented. Previous
to 's event, Matthias preached a remarkable sermon, which,
if it contained nothing new to his disciples, who had believed
in the same doctrines before he came among
themhpet they
were new to the people, and being preached ope y, occa-
sioned some trouble. Candour is one of Matthias' virtues;
as far as we can see, he would keep nothing secret, and if
secrets have been kept, they have so been at the request of
others; he
atpiplears
to have spoken openlyand to have acted
openly, and openness seems to be the charm which has
sthched Isabella to him' she could scarcely believe that he
did not mean well; yet her conclusions are not necessarily
true.

Tnr: circumstances which led to the arrest of Mr. Mills
upon a charge of insanity, was no doubt the rumoured ex-
penditure of Matthias, who about this time, the summer of
1832, appears to have rojected the building of a New Je-
rusalem, to be fumishetiielegantl and with plate, of course
at the expense of his friends. Stone relates his having
called at the store of Mr. Gardner, in company with Mr.
Mills, and giving large orders for plate, sunnounted with
the Lion of the Tribe of Judea, and of Mr. Mills subsequently
calling there, with a servant bearing a large tea service of
silver, to receive the ornament of the Lion, and various scrip-'
tural inscriptions, such as,
"
The kingdom of God is at hand"
He then ordered a silver chalice, with two inscriptions, one
of which was, that "
it was
presented to the prophet Mat-
thias by himself and children." These events seem to have
determined Mr. Mi11s's family to arrest both him and Matj

thiaa on the charge of lunacy. The account given by E.
Stone is extremely brief,V he
_simfly says,
"
That on a wu-
nnt, the gentleman referred' to
(or he is not named in the
book) was sent to Bloomingdale Lunatic Asylum, and Mat-
to theapartment of the insane poor at Bellvue." He
"adds, (page l39,)
"
It having been suggested to thebrother
of _onevof the disciples, (Mr. Mills,) that the secret of the
Eephefs power over his iniintuated followers, like Samson. l
y in his hair, means were found to set the Philistines of l
the lice upon him, and he was shorn of his fhvourite
i
_
When this transaction occurred, we wrote an 'article in
"
the Sunday Reporter, which we then published,yregarding t
Matthias as a fanatic or impostor, but highly condeninatory
ofthis act of violence, disgraceful to the parties originating
it,»disgracefiil to_ the police, avtportion of whom could be
bribed to violate the peace, for which they are paid topre
serve, and disgraceful to the county in which it could 'exist
without a redress; and we
have not altered our opinion.; It
is ecisely this spirit which is now ruining the country,
and"blasting its fair fame in the eyes of Europe. We then
declared that that treatment was likely to excite pity and
sympathy, and' this we
believe to have been the case,_apd
Mr. and Mrs. Folger, with several others, possibly owe a, |
chain of unpleasant circumstances to this feeling: it cer-
'
tainly riveted the devotion of Isabella and Mr. Piersonto
the cause of Matthias, and Mr. Folger expressed the opinion,
that he was ill treated, and hence induced, after a ln of
time, to offer him an asylum. Isabella's account of this all
fair does not differ, but she gives' the detail of the arrests,
and their effects, without judging of the motives. Mr. An-
drew`Mills, Mr. Croolter, and Mr. Dias, appeared to direct,
while the constables stripped Matthias, took his money, cut 1
luis bearded; and tormented him in every way. Mr. Mills
1
was taken without resistance, previous to the violence~ on
Matthias. Isabella, who is a powerful and energetic wo-
man, offered some resistance to the violence to Matthias, and

This

lust iiler Mr. Mills was taken, Mrs. Drach came to the
house, and continued in close conversation \vith Matthias.
Catherine Galloway, whose husband was Mr. Mills's ser-
vant, also came in. She, too, offered Isabella an
asylum;
ltutthis also she declined, and returned to Mr. Pierson's,
wlmm she assisted in procuring Matthias' release, by
appli-
cltimto Mr. Buckland, a lawyer, and then to the brot er
of mlthias, to take out an habeas corpus, by which he was
as of sound mind. He was then arrested on a
Ulllige of blasphemy, but for this he gave bail, and wa

inquiry on thissubject, and find no truth in it. Mn.
gall, an
elderly person, was his chief female
companion,"
and scarcely any others saw him. One indeed he w
`pped,
a
young Methodist woman, who declared that she was sent
by Jesus Christ. Matthias undertook to say that the Lord
never s ke to young 'girls, and that she had a
devil; he
directodlher to go to her father, and
gave her a few stripes
'with a
rattan; she never came again. This
may be the
conduct of a
tyrant or fanatic, but certainly not of a licentious
rson. We notice this the more as unfair and unjust in
Er. Stone, because the leading object of his book is to carer
up the licentiousness of his friends,,and that of Matthias,
vhen its exposure would involve them. It is this conduct
which provokes a reply, for we wish to deal out evenhanded
justice. Mr. Stone, too, says, that he learned from papers
discovered after the arrest, that Matthias wished to unite his
daughtento Mr. Mills. We think this possible, from what
mlterwards took lace. `Mr. Stone says, too, that Mr. Mills
was
pleased with the as lum and his treatment. This he
"might be; but he adds, that in a short time he became con-
vinced that Matthias was an
irnpostor. We have some evi-
dence which contradicts this, which we shall offer in its
place, as our
only oliject is the truth of the statements.
Isabella, ever active in what he believes right, visited the
asylumnvhere Mr. Mills was, two
days alter he was con-
ined. The kee rs
supposing she was sent by his brother,
was about to leaseher to him; Isabella saw that they were
deceived, but not choosing to act under false colours, she
declared her name, and who she was, when she was refused
admittance. She however went again in a few months'
time. Mr. Mills saw her coming up from his window, and
mme down to meet her. At this meeting he
expressed the
same iaith as before, and gave her an order on his brother's
house for twenty dollars, which money was given to Mat~
thins. Mr. Mills exhorted her to continue in the faith; this
exhortation, and the gift of twenty dollars, seems at variance
with Mr. Stone's accoimt.

of Matthias: "
Paradise," she observed, *"°was formerly on,
the earth, and it would be so now if the wicked were
not
here; the wicked then will be driven from the earth into,
the sky, and the earth made a
paradise again for the goodé'
This notion, it
appears,
occasioned some amusement, if not
-conviction. Matt ias and his disci les at this time did not
believe in a resurrection of the bodiy, but that the spirits of
the former saints _would enter the bodies of the
present ge-
neration, and thus begin heaven upon earth, of which he
and Mr. Pierson were the first fruits.
Mr. Pierson appears to have been timid, and was
appre-
hensive of violence in his house, if Matthias remained t ere;
he therefore proposed a
monthly allowance to him, recom-
mended him to take a house, and take Isabella to live with
him, This he did, and took- a house in Clarkson Street,
lea: St. John's burying-ground. On this occasion Matthias
sent for his family, and gave money to his brother George,
a shoe maker, to go on to Albany and bring them down,
together with his own
family, to whom also he offered tha
use of his house. George did goto Albany, but gave Mrs.
Matthias no
money, as she says, and she now complains that
he did not properly represent his situation, and consequently
that she refused to come or send the family, which she now
regrets, as it might have prevented unpleasant consequences
at nn after period George, however, brought his family!
and found comfortable quarters with Matthias. These cir-
wmstances are not mentioned by Mr. Stone, vho merely
nys, that he took the noted Isabella for his housekeeper;
and conveys the idea, in another place, that at this time
lhtihias was immoral. W'e have examined into this fact,
and see no reason for _such a conclusion ; but believe this a
mnn insinuution, and an
attempt to fasten on Matthias im-

without affecting his friends, and with a perfect'

this Matthias reproved
him§ and aiter a Vhitti to leave the house, which
he did, taking two',-leads of 'furniture belonging to Matthias
nnd'Isabe1la, i1i"¥I|§iillid§'*lhsence, with him, and some ex-
gsive
articles. Tlaee'c'hieT=funds of course had
Hreviously
n furnished by Mi':'?Pierson, but Isabella had rawn her
money from the Saving Bank to help fumish the house. At
this time Isabella was alone in the house with Matthias;
her 'being so was evidently accidental, or he might have
beettso before ; nor do we see
any impropriety in his having
;such a
housekeeper. Indeed, up to this time, and till after
he went to Sing Sing, his moral character was not affected,
against which Mr. Stone shows no facts; neither does he
make out that Isabella is the Most wicked of the wicked.
In May, 1833, Matthias left this house, and placed the
furniture, part of which was Isabella's, in the store of Mr.
Southerling, in Greenwich Street. This furniture was afi
terwards removed to _
Mr. Wl1iting's, Canal Street, where
Isabella lived as servant; and Matthias lodged at the hotel
'corner of Markettield and West Streets. Mr. Stone says,
that 'while here hisconduct was liable to no censure; he
continued to converse and dress as before, but if the landlord
thought him troublesome, a hint was sufficient to make hint
cease. Mr. Stone adds, "Justice requires it to be said, that
so as is known, his moral character was
irreproachable
while residing at the Battery."
We now retum to Isabella, who still ke t up a connexion
with Matthias by washing for him, even wlxile in the service
of Mrs. Whiting, by her

hoods on her retum she lived with Mr. Smith's family, a
fr, in Hudson Street, and here also she washed for
_; and while in this situation, Matthias called on
her,`pji.id her for washing, and told her he had seen Mr.
Folger, and was going into the country for a short time.
We"believe Mr. Folger had not seen much of Matthias be-
fore, for he had retired into the country about the time that
Matthias introduced himself to Mr. Pierson, and Mr. Fol-
gefsbusiness
had led him much out of town, so that he had
but little about him. A short time after Matthias had
gone intothe country, Mrs. B. Folger and Mr. Pierson's
youin est daughter, Elizabeth, called on Isabella, and asked
for hgtthias' clothes, and said that she was Mrs. B. Folger,
and that Matthias was at their house, and well pleased. Mrs.
B. Folger was then introduced to Miss Smith, to whom she
related the same. The clothes were given to her, and by
instructions forwarded to the Union boat. We shall pre-
sently see how these facts comport with the account publish-
ed by'Mr. Stone, which he says is furnished by Mr. and
Mrs. Folger conjointly.
In about a fortnight alter M'rs. Folger had fetched Mat-
thias' clothes, Matthias called on Isabella, told her that Mr.
Pierson had fits, and that Mrs. Folger wanted help at Sing
Sing, and would be glad to have her. Isabella went to see
Mr. Pierson, and saw him in tits. She afterwards went to
Sing Sing, and resided with Mrs. Folger; but as
they had
all things common, she removed there her furniture, Mr.
B. Fol r
supcrintending its transfer, which had been stored
at Mr.%'hiting's.
We will now open Mr. Stone's book, and there show how
he manages this introduction to Sing Sing.
In' chapter 7, page 146, of Mr. Stone's book, we find the
ucountvof Mr. and Mrs. Folger's introduction to Matthias.
I-Ie informs us, that Mr. Pierson had frequently sought
to Mr. Folger to hear Matthias, but owing to business
no op ortunity; but that in_the autumn of 1832,
inding he had) some time to spare, after a return from the
munity, Mr. and Mrs. Folger sought out Mr. Pierson ex~
preaaly to learn the particulars of Matthias, the accounts of

which, and of Mr. Mills's arrest, the had seen in thepa-
rs. Mr. Pierson ofcourse gave a gvourable report; and
gr. Stone then states, that the account he is about to give of
the proceedings at Sing Sing, he has received from Mr. and
Mrs. Folger; he adds, that he has entire confidence in the
narration, and he again says, the occurrences at Sing Sing
except those concerning Mr. Pierson's death, are
only known
to Mrs Folger and Matthias. Well, we have seen Matthias.
and obtained from him a direct or indirect assurance of all
the important facts which we have to state; but Isabella,
who was evidently not calculated on
by either Mr. Stone or
Mr. and Mrs. Folger, is perhaps equally knowing with those
before mentioned, and what is of great consequence, willing
to tell thc whole truth, or all she knows.
i
_
After this introduction their narrative begins, which
briefly states, that they received instruction from Mr. Pier-
son to close their Sunday Schools, which they had o ned
in Sing Sing, and to discontinue communing with the ciiiirch
at the same place, and urged them to search the Scriptures
in
proof of these things. 'I'hey did search, and Pierson ex-
plained difiiculties. These instructions are understood to be
In accordance with Matthias' principles. They then pub-
lish the deposition of Folger, made at the time of Matthias'
arrest, which states Matthias frequently called on Mr. Fo!-
ger, at his house of business, and assumed that the spirit of
Matthias animated Jesus, but that at the second coming, he,
Matthias, was animated by the Spirit of God, could forgive
sins, and communicate the Holy Ghost to such as believed.
And taking advantage of a circumstance, he said, "You see
but one end of this sheet of paper, which is outside this
draw, but I see the whole of it; I sec the end-and thus I
soe the end of all things." Folger then states, that he be-
came fully convinced of the`truth of Matthias, (and we be-
lieve invited him to his house at Sing Sing, and that, too,
much at the instigation of Mrs. B. Folger;) yet the next
sentence begins thus: "
About the 20th of August, 1833. on
our return (Mr. and Mrs. Folger's) from a short visit to New
York, we found Matthias at our residence. He had been
there two days. He was an unexpected visiter, but we
_ NARRATIVE or rsannnu. 67
soon heard from his lips an account of his sufferings for the
cause of truth, and our minds being prepared by Mr. Pier-
son, to receive him in the character he announced himself;
it being as dangerous to reject truth as to receive error, we
invited him to stay over Sunday, expecting him to go on
Monday." _
`
Buch is the -commencement of Mr. Stone's publication of
Mr. and Mrs. Folger's narrative; yet it will be remembered
that Mrs. B. Folger fetched Matthias' clothes.
tk
In Mr. Stone's book there is at this place a. line of stars,
us:
»
_
s an o s e »
We must endeavour to
supply the place. The fact is, that
Mrs. '", the lady whom we shall soon introduce, and is
much abused by Mr. Stone, visited Sing Sing about this
time. for the express purpose of denouncing Matthias, and
clmtioning Mrs. B. Folger against the delusion. This, it
appears probable to us, was inserted by the honest of Mr.
and Mrs. B. Folger, but erased by the tact of Stone,
who saw that it was fatal to the previous part of the work,
in which he endeavours to show, that Mrs. B. Folger was
the unfortunate dupe of Mrs. *"*'s enthusiasm, being in-
fluenced
by her. We believe, then, that these stars refer to
this omission, for this fact is excluded from his book. We
cannot, then, compliment the honesty of Mr. Stone, nor even
his wisdom, shining in ' "' '
".
Our quotations from Mr. Stone's book must now be un-
derstood to be from the narrative furnished him b Mr. and
Mrs. B. Folger. In page 153 the make the declination,
"That every thing they have thine, notwithstandin the
loatbsome scandal heaped upon us
by the unprincipleti has
been done under full conviction that we were doing right."
This osition we shall not dispute, at least for the pre-
sent. &e shall remove the scandal, and suppl facts, and
then review the position' for several pages afier this, we
have the opinions of Matthias, or his doctrines, founded how-
ever on visions and iimcies, and sup rted by texts from the
prophecies and other scriptures. 'iiliese we shall pass for
the present; every person can conceive of visions, and the
53 ruannlvl or rsnlsu.
efeets of regarding them as realities or emanations from
God. Those, however, whichebore upon conduct, we shall
notiee, as illustrating the workings of the minds of the
ge taught that all -diseases were devils, and should be
east out as formerly by Jesus; that wives were decayed by
Bilse teachers to prayer meetings and church, and childrens
to schools in the care of strangers, but that'God's 'plan was
to
pulace
all in families. In _ ge 164, the narrative states,
gr
'ch is evidently principag; written or indited by Mrs.
olger,) that they were in good health generally, while
Matthias was there. This she ascribes to the revious ad-
vice of Dr, Paine, of New 'York, and plain food? It is how-
ever but `ustice to sa , upon the authority of Isabella, Mat-
thias, and some of Pierson's family, that improvements
were made by Matthias, who banished pies, and other super-
Huities, but lwed well; and that he banished pills and medi-
cines, which Mrs. B. Folger had constantly used, before he
came.
'
In page 165, Mrs. B. Folger relates that in the winter of
1834 she was sick; but we shall copy the exact words in
this ease.
." On one occasion, in the absence of Mr. Folger, in the
winter of 1834, Mrs. Folger was taken sick, but she was
required to attend to her household duties, as though she
was well-she was not allowed to complain, but censured
with savage severity because she looked ill, Her fever
and distress, however, increased to' such degree, that she
could no longer keep about-and then he indulged in

We had longbeen in the
practice, by the advice of our
physician before named, of,
using warm and cold bmhs, and
we continued them alter Matthias and his children, and the
servants -introduced by him, came into the Emily. It no
doubt was beneficial to our health, and we believe that Mat-
thias was himself satisfied of the fact; for when our use of
the bath became known to him, he enjoined the practice
upon all the family. It seemed to be something entirely
new to the strangers who had joined us, and th talked
much about it-but there was no indecorous wa:l}iing,,as
has been rumoured. Mrs. Folger alwa had the assistance
of her mother, or of a nurse who had an with usisevenl
years; and subsequently, after she left, of one or the other
of the servants introduced into the iinnily by Matthias-one
of them was Mrs.
Galloway, and the other the coloured
woman, for a_ long time previous, and still a follower of him.
'_ 7' Mrs. Folger always readily assisted any of the females
inturn, when it was
necessary. The bath-house was in the
north wing of the building, where the nurse and children-4
and, when
'
Mr. Folger was absent, Mrs. Folger-slept.
Matthias was quick to observe and improve upon little cir-
cumstances. Soon alter his visit commenced with us, the
housekeeper; in replenishing the pitcher in his room, ear-
ried up more water than the pitcher would hold, and poured
the surplus in the wash-bowl. He- observed it-7-said his
spirit' had directed it, which she had done well to obey;
and from that time he made it a law that all 'must .wash his
or bands the first thing in the morning. Many instan-
ces of this kind, where he borrowed ideas and examples
from others, could be named, and we would sometimes tell
him so; but he would argue the subject quite ingeniously-
showin that the action was by his spirit, and that we were
iaid 'or done in the community, that met his approval, was

This he called his omnipresence." -
The reader will observe that this extract is dated 1834,
and consequently refers to a late period, although in
the beginning of the narrative; and though perhaps not
meant to deceive, is certainly calculated to do so. The sick-
ness here mentioned was that which accompanies child
bearing, and the whole relation is admirably calculated to
obscure, not explain facts; but as it refers to a later period
in the history than that on which we now are, we
merely
beg our readers to retain the sense of this extract, till we
have filled up the intermediate space in the narrative, from
the tesvhnony of Isabella, which is very curious and inte~
resting, and absolutely necessary to a
proper explanhtim of
this extract,
Isabella went to Sing Sing, as we have related, as one of
the rty; she had no wages, put in some goods, and had
all tlilings in common; her regular employment was, how-
ever, in the kitchen; each member of the family had their
regular province. Matthias was called Father, and certainly
directed all, but did not interfere with the several depart!
ments,,when the appointments were once made; so that this
"
all things in common," amounted to very little except a
common_ table and greater familiarity. Isabella did the
common work, Mrs. Folger assisted in the light work,
Matthias did what he liked, while the farm was worked by
others of the establishment. In fact, the family at this time
differed in appearance very little from other well conducted
families; and new comers, such as Mr. and Mrs. Thomp-
son, assisted according to theirqualities; he in farming, she
in needle work. Mr. Pierson, his daughter, and Catherine,
also came to Sing Sing, and filled up their places according
to their habits, he doing light work and amusing himself in
the' garden, or on the farm; Catherine assisting Isabella in
the kitchen, and the daughter engaged in light emplo ent;
and chamber work. When, too, Matthias' family, thldlt is,
his daughter and three sons, arrived, these also filled the
stations they were tit for, assisted on the farm and in the
family, and partook ofthe produce.

We can therefore more easily account for e attachment
which Matthias formed, which we are about to relate, and
on which he shipwrecked his prophetic character,`than~ we
can forthe attachment which she formed to him, and the
extreme sacrihccs which she made, and her perseverance in
obtaining thc object of her choice, when so many difiicnlties
presented themselves, except upon the principles,that the in-
terml spirit contained principles more active than the exter-
nalraypearance-of Mrs. B. Folger warranted in supposing,
md. ,that these principles obtained strength by the powerful
lidspfjjnaticism, which were here thrown on the side of
pallon.
_Nm Folger, from the first, appeared on each morning
drqsed with much taste, highly scented, and her first busi-
D£_WBS_ _to .prepare the seat for Matthias; his linen and
clot.hm_were carefully aired, and when he appeared, in the

he had expressed them to her; it was done thus, pe:-

Isabella, who had longer known him, his i`eel` sud,
opinions on 'irticular subjects; these opinions anilnghngi
_she would aiiierwards express us her own, in his pnesmcc;
when of course he pronounced them 'very misc and my

her upon the possession of the truth, the very spirit Mid
/te had. She too made the discovery, that they were cer-
tainly match spirits. We are
obliged to mention that
things, for they alone explain what follows. '
At this time Mrs. B. Folger began to make Ktthis!
night caps; she gave him also a
large golden ring. Thi
attentions at first paid to Matthias by Mrs. B. Folger, witl
these exceptions, were not more than other single and nm
ried females pay to handsome popular cler en, whoa
they regard as
possessing particular' giits;gii,:'theoe an
served with the first and best attentions, and they onlyabus
their influence in some cases, such as that of Avery, an ag
gravated case. Within two months after Matthias was a
Folger's, Mrs. B. Folger stated to Isabella, that all the pn
perty (the house and farm) at Sing Sing belonged toPthet
given
at her request, as it afterwards appeared. lsnbelli
owever, had some doubts as to what these things woul-
lead° she had, as she expresses it, her own thoughts aber
it. l~'rom our listening to this coloured female,
her frequently, and often recurring to very curious an
doubtful subjects, we have discovered that she too, like Mp
B. Folger, is not exactly what she seems. Though bs;
xnnnlvn or
xsssrzua. BB
in Huis state, she has African features, and no apparent nl!-
turo of blood; she is not
exactlyblgad looking,
buththere
is
nothing' prepossessing or very o ervant or intel 'gent in
hex' looks; yet throughout we find her reflecting, "she had
her own or
private opinion on every thing ;'? and these
'of her mon we
have frequently found very correct;
ygt is not communicative, and if circumstances did' not"
pluqmpt her to tell all she knows, it would be difficult to get
at It
At Srst, Matthias appeared only the recipient of Mrs. B.
Folgefs attentions, and he was
unconsciously madeto flatter
har, when she presented to him his own opinions; in those
s iments, if Mrs. B. Folger made a mistake, and advan-
ugin opinion or feeling contrary to his, with the authority
of the Father, he corrected it, when Isabella found that Mrs.
B. Holger possessed a wonderfiil tact in backing out, ex~
plmining away her meaning, and getting at last to mean just
what Matthias meant. She has given us, or rather we have
extracted from her,~a variety oi? amusing examples of this
sort, but the detail would be trifling in point. Isabella had
her own opinions of these things, and getting at her .private
thoughts, she said it appeared to her, that the spirit which
had occupied Mrs. Bolton, being foiled in its attempt upon
1{atthias~ in her
person-(lg/Iatthias
had rebuked the preten-
sions and conduct of Mrs. olton)-had left her person, and
got into the more delicateframe of Mrs. B. Folger, that in
that shape she might tempt him. We asked how such an
influence over him could comport with his pretensions of
professing the spirit of the Father! and she replied, like as
David was
tempted, who was after God's own heart; and
Matthias was not more than David. Here we
stopped our
theological inquiry, to get at facts.
During the progress of these things, Matthias and Mrs.
B. Folger spent much of their time in conversation, a
large
portion of which consisted in telling each other their expe-
rience, and it_may be charitable to conceive that a
'great
deal
of selklelusion followed. As the conversations, ough not
private, were téte-42-téte, we _have no right to know any
thing about them directly; all that Isabella can speak to,

`
Thus we get at the tiihlre
oétbese- conversations, not from Isabella, but from other
`
r-
lons in the establishment, one of whom has know-n_
many ears, to whom Matthias has related facts, and' the na-

intimacy with Mrs. B. Folgeniwhile Mrs. B. Folger has
done the same toothcrjpcrsons, to justify her intimacy with
Matthias, and consequently eirplained much of theconve`rsa~
tion that passed»betwecn them.
'
Q
'
Matthias, who, as Mrs. B. Folger observes, is not slow to
learn or to taken hint, must have observed the devotedness
ot`.,Mrs. B.'Folger to him, and the advantage it gave him
over her,,if he chose to exert it. _
The basis was
already
laid orrboth their arts; he had
openly denieglthe common
'marriages to be oi) God; and she ha had apparently, two
years
before, a 'vision about her married cousin having a
oly child by Mr. Pierson, and being at home in his house.
Here was the base work; the superstructnre was commenced
when he went to Sing Sing, first by her extraordinary at-
tentions to the Father; he soon informed her that he had a
revelation before he came to Sing Sing, in which he had
breaker as the Mother of the Institution he was abont to
mise; so that when he did see her, he instantly recognised
her las the object of his vision. He, too, was the master
builder,_and the proper person to select the mosfsnitable
.materials to build up the temple of the Lord. He, too, re
presented himself as Adam, the beginner of a
nevfotder;
and where God made Adam, there was somewhere ah Eve
'to be brought to light in the course of eventsf Thustheae
.things were gradually opened to Mrs.. B. Folger; his expe~
"rieneeiand revelations were re-revealed 'to her, and the re-
plied
with her experience. These were the conversations
y day, and
they
were
very naturally followed by dreams
and revelations y night; and then again, each went to the
Lord, with all humility, to seek the interpretation of these
NARRATIVE 01' IBAIEI-LA. 8
things, and after the manner of Mr. Pierson, they received
various answers, which must have consisted in other drequ,
f
'
s, or
thoughts. Such is the explanation given
himself to one of the inmates, of his whole course
,A and this person has confidence in the sincerity of
-
A
_
_ 'A_,and also in Mrs. B. Folger, with which we at
"gent shall not interfere. We relate these things as facts:
'Wie have compared this account with relations through Mr.
Pierson, and other sources, for we have with a
singular co~
g' e had access to
nearly
all the pnrty, with the means

.Some time after Matthias had been at Sing Sing, in 1833,
Mr. Pierson getting something better of his fits, came to
Sing Sing, but retained his house in Third Street, in care of
a coloured woman named Julia, and still later in care of
Catherine Galloway, holding the creed of Matthias, the

Late inthe itll-of 1833, scarcely three months after Mat-

however, went to bed, and Mrs. B. Folger followed in the
)
lame room, in the north wing. On the next evening, Mm- n
thias and Mrs. B. Folger were again is intense conversa-
tion, and the appearance of Mrs. B. Folger forcibly struck
Isabella, as she entered the room; her eyes. _as it were .
flashed fire; she found again that her presence was not
wanted, and after some careless remark from Matthias, she
'n went to bed. and Mrs. B. Folger followed. The dly
:ggi the next, Mrs. Folger went to New York with Mr.
Pierson, and took this opportunity to make a singular dis-
closure to him, which had occupied her mind some time, vil-
that she was instructed by the
Spirit
that she ought to have
Matthias for a husband; that t ey were matclt spiriil. (B
favourite
expression amongothe party.)
This fact was sta- l
ted to Isabe la afterwards, th by lt r. Pierson and Mrs. B.
Folger. Mr. Pierson received the declaration without as
tonishment ; his mind was
evidently prepared for any
strggt
revelations, and he was one who might be said to be gr y
of belief The two notes, written two years before, upon _H
similar subject, and his own reflections on them, and hs
conlidence in the purity of Mrs. B. Folger, and in the belief
of the truths of visions and revelations, explain this suljetl.
we do not say sulliciently; it is so strange that it may bt 4
incredible to some, yet it is true, for subsequent events show
it to be the only possible case.
It appeared -that Mrs. B. Folger's mission, at that time
was to visit her husband, then in New York, and induce
him to give her up to Matthias, and to induce Mr. Piemv
to second her monstrous proposition, and in this she SUS'
needed. We must beg our readers'
patience;
the subject 15
so
strange, so monstrous, so
out of al course, and contrary
to expenenee and history, so comet-like, that we can scamely
hope
to carry the credence of our readers with us. That I
vn e should secretly betray her husband, is very possible;
such things have always been; and that a clergyman. U
pftender
to holiness and inspiration, should secretly abuse
°
influence, obtain the affection of married women, and

Q
them and their husbands, isf not only within the
'of belief; but a matter of,
fact andrecord, which
alwayrlbllowed 'the course -of a wealthy clergy, gradually
corrupt; but that a virtuous, res ted. and 'amig-
ble female, should deliberately uns&e to' induce
her husbandto give her up to an
iumateclaimingto be very
holy, and endowed withthe Spirit of God, never before hap-
pened,_to our
knowledge, and stands unique in the history
of 'the world, and therefore we
scarcely expect credence, 'es~
pecialuly when that husband was of the same faith, was gear
tlem` y, humane, fond of his wife, even to excess, in good
circumstances, had a
iamily, and surrounded with domestic
comforts, with the wer to enjoy them; but if such a ihct
is so incredible, is a new case in human
society,
or
nearl so, there is the greatest necessity for a faithfu ac-
eounga full, true, and 'particular account of such a
phenome
non; tracing as far as possible all the secret sources and
motives ofthe mind. We do not then ask your credence in
this monstrous fact; we only ask
your patience till 'we
have laid before you all our propositlons, and the evidence
both in testimony and in consequences, for it will be 'found
that this belief is necessary to the explanation of liicts indis-
putablc, and quite as marvellous. '
_
Mr. Pierson and Mrs. B. 'Folger went to Mr. B.
Few
and succeeded in their strange and monstrous project,
not without a severe struggle, passion and distress of
mind, on the part of the aifectionate husband, and, we 'sus-
pect also, from subsequent events, that a
positive promise
was also given of a substitute, which, while it explains one
pan of the subject, renders another more difficult. The re-
resentation to him was, that it was the work of .
God; that
god designed it; that she and Matthias were maids
ssieritt;
that the 'Lord had shown her that she should take Fa p
rto
be her husband; and that she was to have a
holy son., To
induce Mr. B. Folger to consent to this, we have reason to-
believe, from facts afberwardsto he established. that a beau~
daughter of Matthias, then
supposed
to" be a
maid. was promised to him, as a substitute; ut Mr. Folger

he had never seen; and though Matthias might have my
geated D, as a
holyproeeeding, Mrs. B. Folger must hm
urged it, as gratifying to him, or not entirely from spiritual
motives; and this strange mixture of spiritual credence and
carnal impulses, are found mixed up through the whole ph?
ceedings, and could only be conceived and practised in con-
nexion ,with great fanaticism. It isthis connexion of carnal
feeling with s iritual ihnaticism, which can alone explw
the strange suhject we are now delineating. _
`_ We_do not know the particulars of the treaty, or what
took lace at the interview between Mr. and Mrs. B. Folger
and. Pierson, from them, nor from Isabella, through
them, except the result and occasional
expressions.
and con
versations of Mrs. B. Folger with Isabel a, on the difficulty
of her task. This was not made generally a subject of con
versation; _but the facts oiten came out in disputes; but
Catherine Galloway, who then kept the house in Third
Street, where this scene took place, told all she knew on tht!
suliect to Isabella, which was, that "there was a terrible
to-dio nearly all night," and that from the noise and tonw,
she discovered that Mr. B. 'Folger was afflicted with botll
grief and passion. _
Isabella did not know the object of the journey, but ln
about a week Mrs. B. Folger retumed, and as the carriage
was seen coming, the family had assembled in the hall K0
receive her, and among the rest her children and Isabella-
On former occasions, she would caress her children, as the
first objects of her affection; on this, she hurried across the
path, rushed up the steps, passed her children, Isabella, and
the rest, and, to the astonishment at least of Isabella, flew
into the arms of Matthias, standing in the north wing door
way, and he and she hurried into the chamber, and shut the
door, where they remained at least half an hour alone.
These facts render the occasional, or the single ease of riding
in the carriage alone, previously, an object of no conse-
quence Some time aiierwards, on the Saturday, Mrs. B.
Folger went into the kitchen, appeared particularly happy,
gave directions to have the house set in order, and an espe»
cial direction to set the west room (Mr. and Mrs. Folgefn

bella) something that would make her (Isabella) volyglad.
She also had made u three new chemises, without name,
and gave out a new shirt and night cap to,Wash,.!lmt had
been previously made with care, while the ,Wristband of
the shirt was carefully set with edging." This -excited
some surprise in Isabella, as it was not the iimlzkl wash-
ing. The same day she ,set out for New York, promising
to return on
Saturday.
'
.
_ =
On Saturday, Matthias took the carriage and 'went to
Tarrytown to meet the boat, and brought up Mr; and Mrs.
B. Folger, and Mr. Pierson, and on their arrivml,.and inthe
presence of Mr. Pierson, Mr. B. Folger solemnl .gave his
wife into the hands of Matthias, to be this, Mattlliash wife.,
for the future, in the name of ANN Dssanossx, and re-
nouncing her as his wife. On the same night Matthias and
Mrs. B. Folger slept together in Mr. Folger's former bed
room; and from that time forward Matthias and Mrs. B.
Folger lived within the house avowedly as man and wife,
while Mr. B. Folger slept in the room formerly occupied
b Matthias.
yPrevious, however, to the parties retiring to rest, the
uxorious fondness ofMr. B. Folger ap red to revive, and
he seemed to wish some token of kindifigss from her. In
the hall, and in the presence of Isabella, he followed his
wife about, who evidently avoided him, and in the mos
plaintive tone, he exclaimed, "
Ann, Ann," while she re-.
pulsed him at ever
point. He endeavoured to catch het
b the hand, but she withdrew it, and in stem accents ex-
chtimed, "
Benjamin, behave yourself" He attempted to
lay hold of her person, when she pushed him away with
force, and he sunk on a chair, while she escaped
p)x;acipi~
lately to her room. So pitiable did Mr. B. Folger lt on
this occasion. and so much did Mrs. B. Folger's stemness
excite Isabella's feelings, that she looked upon Mr. Folger
with the
fgreatest pity, surprise, and sympathy, and in the
relation o these iitcts, used a most expressive, but coarse
comparison, for she is uneducated. and was brought up on
a tixrm: °'

place on the day ofthe' union, and that she was now united
to Matthias, and should take her station, (Mother,) with
much simplicity, Isabella asked, "
but are

with lim 2" to which was replied, "yes, certainly." 'Ilhesq
and other questions, led to explanations, and the subject was-
akervlards one of frequent conversation between Isabella and
Hothr, the one asking questions, and the other replying;
while Isabella "
had her own
thoughts about the matter," as'
she expresses herself:
Upon investigating this subject thoroughlly, we discover
that Mrs. B. Folger had long wished for this union, and
that she ascribed the feelin s of desire which she admitted
she had strongly felt, to God Matthias, too, attributed simi-
lar feelings to God, in an acknowledgment to a friend of
ours Mrs. B. Folger really supposed, or at least appeared
I0 'Iris-ll that Isabella should suppose, her something supe
rior to other women, just as she supposed Matthias superior
to other men, not only in holiness, and as reci ients of the
Holy Ghost, and of the Spirit of God, but in bodily qualities
alsot She claimed to be a
virgin, and considered herseli
either more than woman, or Mr. Folger less than man, and
declared that she received no satisfaction from the one, and
gent satisfaction from the other, and offered some physical
reasons why she should be a virgin, and yet have children,
which she attributed to extraordinary circumstances on par~
ticular occasions, and after fasting. We do not, however,
pretendto understand the physical ower claimed or derived,
nor do we understand the mystical): we
regard the wholeas
halltlcination, or the doctrine of visions or dreams, supposed
to be emanations from God. We believe Mrs. B. Folger
lobe no more than woman, and Mr. B. Folger not lessthan,
1581), and the whole a
selifdeception, or an
attempt to deceive
otben. and to offer excwes for what 'those not instructed by
the Spirit, called errors, faults, or crimes.
K3 B. Folger, too, admitted that she made the applicw-
tion to Matthias: that in so
doing she had taken a eros; ;
and med to him, in conclusion, precisely the woim she had

the vagaries ot' a mad man.
'
In u few wet-ks atier the union of Matthias and Mrs. B.
Folger, Mr. Folger set ol? in search of his promised spouse.
(He had indeed a substitute in the interim, of whom we
shall speak afterwards.) Ve find in our notes, that Mrs.
B." Folger had informed Isabella, that Matthias' daughter
had been promised to Mr. B. Folger. The account given
in Mr. Stone's book runs thus:
"Matthias was anxious to have his liniiily with us for
some time before they finally came. Mr. Folger was un-
willing' to go for them, and suggested that Mr. Matthias
should go, 'with the carriage and horses, but he declined for
reasons known only to himself At length Mrl Matthias'
and"Mr. Pierson's continued urgency prevailed. and Mr.
Folger took his son with him and went to Albany, with the
carriage, for his wife and children. He found them in re-
dticed circumstances, and barely able to obtain a
Support.
He gave Mrs. Matthews whatever means she asked for, to
elqthe the children with wzmn clothing entirely-bought
several articles and presented them, and gave her money lbr
'her own
purposes. Mr, Folger was instructed by Matthias
before he leli home, as he understood him, in case nn
f
thing
should prevent :mv of the fnmily`from coming befrire the
*U
iing, to have them coiiifortalrly provided for there until

child, about (ive years old-as sh; determined not to go r=
self; or send the youngest child, until spring; but on
repon-
ing the promise to Matthias, he said he had been misunder
stood, and totally forbade any money being sent het-that
she was a wicked, lying devil,
unworthy
of
anywfavour.
Mrs. Matthews gave into Mr. F.'s charge our of t child-
ren-u daughter and three sons. The daughter had been
married about a month previous, to a
young
manng
the
name of Laisdell; but for some reason, never expla-i , this
was concealed from Mr. Folger by the mother and the hue
band, or he would have felt it his duty to have had the husf
'band accompanied the children, or to decline taking the
daughter. Mrs. Laisdell mentioned her marriage in the
course of conversation on the journey. The boys were
somewhat ungovernable,and having been rather exposed at
Albany, their manners were not as good as could have been
desired, so that with four boys (including his own
son.) and
Mrs. Laisdell, he found it quite alburdensoriie expedition,
and excited much remark on the road, which was
truly un-
pleasant."
Mrs. Matthias, in her book of "
Matthias, by his wife,"
gives an account of Mr. B. Folger's arrival at Albany, and
her surprise, for she had heard that Matthias was dead, as
before stated. Mrs. Matthias was pleased both with the ap-
pearance and liberality of Mr. B. Folger, and iindi _he
was known to some
persons in Albany, and considergg re
spectable, she consented to send her famil ,
by the advice of
some of her friends, as she says, to see how matters were,
but declined going herself; not liking his doctrines. Mrs
Matthias, however, suppresses some curious facts. which
occur at this time, and which illustrates character, and among
the rest some kissing. Mr. B. Folger had presented Mat-
thias' daughter, who was named Isabella, with a riding
habit of Mrs. B. Folger's, and to this he added a gold watch.,
and when adorned with these articles, Mr. B. Folger kissed
her, observing, that she looked much like his wife. This
kiss Mrs. Matthias turned into a
joke, perhaps to
sathfytthe
young woman's husband, who we believe was plight.

Laisdell, the husband ot" Matthias' daughter, assisted in

conclusion, kissed his wife at parting, which we are assured

about the wealth and respectability of the Folgers, from
ihicb she hoped some advantage; while the husband shared
fallhebounty of Mr. B. Folger, and evidently winked at the
OB. _
account of the journey, as
given by Mr. Stone, is
true, as har as it goes, but there are some
important
qqriosions. Mr. B. Folger's son and Matthias' boys were
dq§,£in the stage, except the younger. John, about eleven*

'the daughter of Matthias, who, it appears, without the-
_
0 knowledge, had been married. This little boy, $09,9,$09,

facceptation of the word; nor do we believe 1
ger, on this occasion, believed he was "prompted
any vision or good spirit, for he
acknowledged V
to Matthias, alter his arrival, which sort offae _i
_
'
ments, it appears, he was in the habit of miliingidiglid' i
thai' as a
part of the system._ We extracted this
from Matthias himself; when excusing himselffitifl

on the road," which ve have just explained. Mr'.'B. -
get 'had also named it to Catherine Galloway, arid of
course to Isabella. Mr. B. Folger said to Catliei'ina§'jhht
he liked Johnny, because he had never mentioned
of his having gone into his sistcr's room; but the
since mentioned it to his mother, and his mother gf _ai-
rectly. We know that Mr. Folger knew she ,wa.s'i!il1'f§d
then, but we do not know if thc child slept in the

do, however, suppose that he had explained previously the
object _of his mission; and he might plead the sacri£og'he
had made for her, and he was no doubt goaded li
`
independent of the spirit. From this fact,
others, Mr. Folger appears to us
decidedly B.lTl0fi)||,lf§d
therefore we are more
surprised at Mrs. Folger's
for Matthias, and neglect of him. The sequel bo;
that Mrs. Laisdell was fond of him, and that he
'ral favourite among females who lmew him, and

even his wife explained away objections.

No! let us take a
retrospect of the party before
`
Our great object in communicating these theta
public, was to show the extent of credulity, and to in
what proportions animal feelings could mix with sp ;
and in fact, what deeds might be done in the name _
Lord; and, at the same time, to apportion to each their
share 'of the blame, according to their deserts, and to relieve
those who were
unjustly blamed, or blamed to an
improper
extent. The latter object must be yet deferred, because
inferences can not be drawn till the whole facts are laid be-
fore the public. On the first object we can now draw some
conclusion. In the name of God, and under the assumed
'dance of his S irit, Matthias procured the posession of
glge proper! , both of Mr. Pierson and Mr. Folger, and re
eeived the will: of the latter into his bosom, and she a woman
of a
gentle spirit, with a
family, living in the atlcctiona of
her husband, and respected by her friends. But Matthias
is already reputed an impostor by some, and insane by
others, and that may bc considered an answer, as far as he
is concerned. We will therefore let him pass, till we draw
his portrait. ,
,, _
Mr. Pierson has been kindly admitted to be partly iimane.
and he too may go, together with Mr. Mills. Then we have
Mr. and Mrs. Folger, both regularly converted, the one at
least religiously brought up, both moral, benevolent, and
apparently sincere, pious, and extremely zealous, wearying
heaven with prayers and singing loud hallelujahs, the ac-
tive members of various reli 'ous and charitable institutions.
md unspotted in the world-l yet the one, the fair female,
seeksto detach a pious, childless friend, from her husband.,
and, in the name of religion, to cause her to have a son
by
her friend, Mr. Pierson, a
holy son it is true. She after-
wards allows her ailections to centre on another mantthaa
her husband, and carefully nourishes the passion which
another woinan would sup ross, and seeks to have a son
by
him., also a
holy son, and the desire itself or the lust of the
leslgk ascribed to be God. She concocts the_meaas_ef

PREFACE TO PART SECOND.
_.T..i._.
Srncs ublishing the first part of this narrative, Isabel-
la, from wliom we
originally obtained the leading facts, has
recovered 2525inaslandersuitagainstMr.B.Folger, in a slander suit against Mr. B. Folger,
one of the principal subjects of this narrative; and in this
case this gentleman offered N0 defence; thus leaving us to
draw the inference that his statement was a
groundless false-
hood, and as ita peared on the trial, for a sinister purpose;
and one too, of tlie most atrocious nature. 'I'he slander con-
sisted in having stated that this coloured woman had dttempt-
ed to oison his family; made, apparentl , to destroy her
credibility, as she was
expected to give evidence unfavoura-
ble to him, in the case of Matthias. The first part of this
book was
published before this slander suit came on, al-
though that 'suit was begun a long while before. Now this
suit offered a fine op rtunity, to throw discredit upon her
testimony, could it have been done, which would have at
once 'reduced the damages to that which was merely nom-
inal, and have put the extinguisher on this publication, as
far as her evidence went: nov no such advantage was
taken, from vhieh we draw two conclusions; that her cha-
racter for truth is at least established, and that he, Mr. B.
Folger, is capable of falsehood of a most atrocious nature.
On publishing the first part, we forwarded a copy to all"
the New York papers that we could think of: several of'
these have reviewed the work, and no one has shown a
sin le error in one of our statements. We have reason to
beléve that all the parties namedin the work, or referred
to, and those interested in it, and know some of the facing
4 runes.
have seen the first putt; they have been publicly invited
to point out any errors in it, with an assurance that we
would correct them in this part, but no
complaint has
been made. We have seen some relations of Mr. and Mrs.
Folger, and Mr. Pierson, and we have seen several inmates
of the house at Sing-Sing; and these, as far as each one
knows, confirm the truth of our statements: we have also
seen a number of persons in New York, and Sing-Sing,
connected with some of the transactions, and each of these
confirms the accuracy of our facts, as fhr as each is ac-
quaintcd. Besides, we have made ourselves legally respon-
sible : wc could have no right to publish these statements
if they were not correct; and if this coloured woman has
given to us false statements, she would deserve a criminal
prosecution fbr such conduct, but we have had now abun-
dant opportunity to test her evidence 1 we have perhaps seen
fifty different people, some vho knew some small parts of
the transactions which she has related, and not one out of
the whole, gives a statement different from hers; vhile
most of them, in speaking of the same
subjects, which she
has mentioned, give some rulrlitérmrzl facts, which she either
did not know, or had forgotten at the time; but which ad-
ditional facts, invariably harmonize with and corroborate her
testimony; while some facts, apparentlyincredible, have re-
ceived confirmation,from sources which she did not know to
exist. While therefore in this second part, as in the first, we
have sought out other evidencethan hers, yet weare restrain-
ed to say, that we
might place a
perfect reliance on her narra-
tive. A large portion of our white evidence, are desirous not
to have their names introduced: this we have complied with
as far as the necessity of the case would admit; without,
however, binding ourselves, which we have avoided. In
the case of Mr. Burnham, a
respectable merchant and agent
to Mr. Pierson's brother, who administered, he vas partic-
ularly anxious that his name should not be connected with
so
dirty a subject, as he expressed himself; and he very in-
solently told us we must not bring his name in ; while at the
Same time he refused us information, which would have
precluded the necessity for such mention of his name. Ann

as to_his mart, we know of no
oblipation
where truth re-
quires it; and where it does, our on y answer to his must
not, is, that we will. That gentleman is or was in
possession
of Mr. Pierson's Diary, a. fact we ought tdmention as the
means of coniimting many of our statements. He has made
this diary a subject of conversation, for his friends' have men-
tioned it to us; and he let Mr. Stone extract from it, but.
he has denied it to us, with a
plausible reason; but
neither will he give us
any infomation from it, when a
reference to that Diary would be better evidence for
many
things, than to him, or to others; because Mr. Pierson had
put to paper, facts asthey occurred. This gentleman did in-
deed tell us, that he would, condescendingly, say whether
any fact in the Diary was correct or not, if we would sub-
mit any known fact mentioned in the Diary to him: but im
the same conversation he said we had published an error,
or repeated one of Mr, Stone's, but declined pointing out
what or where; the consequence is, that we have no confi-
dence in his sim le yea or nay: nor are we under any-
obligation to him fgr his endeavours to suppress the truth.
We believe we are in possession of every important fact;
butthe public would have been glad to have Mr. Pierson'a-
testimony to its truth, in addition to the evidence we oflhr.
We have seen also Mr. Pierson's brother, the administrator,
and his sisters; but
thpgv,
while they display a
great and
'
feverish anxiety about e
property of their late brother,
know ve little about the kingdom, and affect to believe
that Mrilil. Folgerhasthe Diary, and that Mr. Burnham
has only a few papers: we have obtained from lllil source
no valuable information; but at the sametirne we are um-
trsmmelled by any partialtobligations.

'
Tru object of this work is usually mistaken by those
wholook onl at the titlepage: it is commonly supposed»
tube I detailea'account of monstrous opinions, and acts of
deception, and gross immoralities of s man, already re~
gded
as mad, or as a vile. unprincipled impostor; andns
Keople
are necessaril 'prepared to believe any thing of
sue a
_rnan, there is little curiosity on the subject, because
results ever so monstrous would prove nothing, as the feats
of madmem and the villan of kneves, have no limits, and
however strange their eondynct, that strangeness is in perfect
accordance with their supposed characters and principles.
Without determining the precise character of Matthias $1
the present. we declare this not to be the object of the work,-'
and only introduced as , subservient to another important
riblioobject: viz. the clearmsnifestation that sincere piety
acts protection against the
§rossest
errors in
prinertleg
and the grossestsbuse of estab ished morals. when sue in-
dlvidnals ascribe their feelings to divine influence. Now
8 ,
runnin or rennu.
`
there are thousands of persons in this city, and tene of than-
sands without it, in the wide world,~who do this, and who
never dream that these feelings may obscure tiheitf g-
ments even when they are iii close communion with'
Y'
as
they suppose, and supplicating ,him dailygfor dirocnoit;
there are thousands we
say, who never dream that 'these
feelings may render them dupes or fools;,.and that theiftfeelg,
ings are excited by circumstances, and are
rtqggral, but rafts-
taken for Divine; and thus they render therrttttliepdupes of
fervent fools or designing knaves: and yet this is the fact,
and it is this fact which this narrative is intended to illus-
trate. And therefore the subject is of importance to thou-
sands, and especially tothe _religious public: but also to the
people at large as n matter of curiosity, and for philosophic-
al investigation. The work, then, has more to do withthe dis-
ciples of Matthias than with Matthias himself; and for the
illustration, it matters not what is the character of this man:
but in our relation of facts, we have been, and shall bdstrictl ,
impartial, and_drav only such conclusions, as the facts shali
fairly warrant, whether such facts are in
favopr, or
against
Matthias, or the inost humble or most elevatedofhisfollowers.
The first part has now been before the public several
weeks. It details facts never before published, nor ever
supposed, and it gives names without reserve, where any
responsibility is implied. We have challenged both invas-
tigation and discussion, and avowed a determination, in this
second part, to correct any error we
may have committed
in the first; but no error has yet been
pointed out, except
the fact, that we have misspelled the maiden name of Mrs.
Folger, which should have been Disbrow, and not Des-
brosse, as we
spelled it. We are informed too that Mr. B.
Folger ought to 'have been called Mr. B. H. Folger.
Wherever, therefore, in this second part, we mention the
name ofFolger, let it be understood as meaning Mr. B. H.
Folger, without we otherwise distinguish it. We conclude,
therefore, that our first part is correct; and yet we are con-
that we have not told all the truthf
'
We have sup-
prdqiyedit
grtion
ofwhat properly belonged to the first part;
rrpeifitht e iintention of deceiving; but because .the facts
ssannrvnor xsanuma. 9'
wéretno incredible to be believed at once. Thus: when we
stated- the fact, that Mrs. Folger had first made lmown to'
Matthias her wishes towards him as
being
"
The Will of
God," and had obtained from him a sanction of her course,
in the expression,
"
Follow the leadings or dictates of the
Spirit," and that in consequence of which she had proceed»
ed to New-York, and after much entreaty, prayer, and sup-
lipcation to her husband, and threats not to live with him,
he, Mr. B. Folger, did give his consent to give her up as
Matthias' wife;--vhen mentioning this fact, we had omit-
ted to state, that a few days before these things took place,
she had vashed or bathed Matthias, in the bathing-room,
with the room-door locked on them alone; and that a sur-
prising longth of time elapsed in this operation, Our read+
ers must now' have patience, till this subject is properly
placed before them, with all our evidence on the subject;
for this is one of those facts we
suppressed in the first part,
as being too incredible for belief; and yet it is it fact, for
which we have positive 'while evidence, according with the
narrative of Isabella, who fetched the water on the occasion,
and remained in the passage by the stove, with Elizabeth,
Mr. Pierson's daughter; and while thus standing, a child
went to the door and tried it, but findingitlocked, retired. To
make the above subject intelligible, we must explain the
doctrine of' Matthias on this topic, and explain also the
practice; previous to which we shall remove the rubbish
which occupies the public mind on this topic, by an un-
principled anonymous publication in this city, viz. that in
the bathing-room, there was u
globe stove; and that the
whole family, in a state of nudity, stood round this stove;
that Matthias first washing himself; communicated a holi-
ness to the water, and that he then sprinkled and washed
tit
bodies of his disciples. Now, the whole of this is false.
'I' e on] globe stove was in the hall, and that in the ordi-
nary bathing-room, in the north wing, there was no stove,
but a common tire~grate, and no such wholesale washing
took place. We need say no more in contradiction, than
that this amusing tale was published in the Sun, which
published the Moon Story.
'
10 ruanrnv: or rsnsus.
`
'
The tircts are these, Matthias preached against bipfilq
or sprinkling, but in favour of washing, or purificationnglr
and the members of the family were
enjoined to wash than
entire body, or
purify themselves, at least once a
week; .
and on other occasions, which seemed to require a sort of'
covenant, as we shall afterward find it practised on such
occasions. -This washing was
performed in a
perfect state-
of nudit ; sometimes in a large tub; and at others, in a
shower hath; both generally in the same room: the men
ordinarily assisted the men, and the women the women.
But in order to com-prehend the fact before stated, it is ne~
cessary to mention another doctrine of Matthias', which led
the way to the result we are relating. Matthias preached
that all shame was sin, or consciousness of want of purity;
and consequently that the most pure would have the least
shame. Now, this doctrine carried out, leads to the `expo~
sure of the person; and though there is no proof whatever
for the assertion ofthe Sun, there is certainly proof that an
indiscriminate exposure might have been the consequence
of this principle; ,
and under certain re ulations, was
proba_
bly intended, had the society continued togqher.
By turning to page 67 and 68, of the first part, the read,
er will find that previous to the union of Matthias with Mrs.
Folger, -they kept up a
longer and closer conversation than
usual, and that Mrs. B. Folger appeared, especially on the
second evening, much excited, we do not know that we
shall now be incorrect, if we
say by the passion of love or
desire, for we have very strong evidence. When we vrote
that paragraph, we did it on the evidence of Isabella; it was
one of those cases we could not hope for other proof: it
made her story consistent; there was, then; no doubt about
the after facts; and those facts must be brought about by
some means, and a free communication must have been
held, before Mrs. B. Folger would have gone to New-York,
to gain Mr. B. Folger's consent for a se ration. On this
reasoning, and because we had not detectedulsabella in a sin-
gle falsehood, we ,admitted that paragraph, and certainly
believed that to have been the time' she communicated to
Matthias her wishes in plain language, so as to bring the
`
.
/
laknnrvx or xsmunu. ll
dlitir to the desired end. Since that paragraph was
'pub-
lished, we have obtained, what we
certainly did not expect,
positive, and white evidence too, that these conversations
,were on the subject suppsed; thus a in establishing the
evidence of Isabella, ina case on whichaneither she nor we
supposed any other evidence existed With a good deal
of trouble, we sought out a Mrs. Thompson, who with her
husband and Simily, resided at Sing-Sing. after this period,
for lbtiut a month, she, to assist the family in needlework,
and he- to assist in the garden and other work. If these
persons were not disciples of Matthias, they held some no.
tions of the happinms to be derived from a family or com-
munity system; and they were
certainly expected to be-
come disciples by the other members, but revolted at the
initiating ordeal. We shall have afterward to mention
these persons more
particularly._ They are not our friends ;
we _only saw Mr; Thompson once, and Mrs. Thompson
once, at separate times and places; they were strangers tri
118, and Mr. Thompson has since attached himself particu-
larly to the interests of Mrs. B. Folger. The are therefore
the friends of both Mr. and Mrs. Folger; of whom the now
speak with respect: we obtained, however, much indclrma-
tion from these rsons, chiefly in confirmation of what we
already knew; hilt as this information came to us through
an
ordinary conversation, without their knowing how much
we knew, we obtained again a valuable confirmation of
Isabella's truth. Mrs. Thompson then told us in answer
to a general question, of how the connexion between Mat-
thias and Mrs. B. Folger was brought about? that Mrs. B.
Folger took upon herself the whole credit; that she had
conversed on the subject; and on the evening when the spi
rit directed her to declare herself to Matthias, that God had
assisted her, for that Mr. Pierson had given her an
oppor-
tunity, by retiring early to bed, and thus leaving them a one,
when she introduced the subject. She explained some of
the means by which she was led to this resolution: she
observed, that she had a vision, and saw two columns of
smoke ascending and uniting at the top; 'and one, she ex-
plained, as
representing herself] and the other, Matthias;
9
_i
I8 uzufrlvl `0Y`~'&1.l.l»
Ami thus weget athurstaiuof mind, and source offld§
deception. We get too at more, for she observed to Mrs.
Thompson,
°'
If
'yiou
have a dream, go to Father." Now,
this going to Fa er with dreams and visions, 'satisfies us,
that though Mrs. Folger takes the credit of seducing Mat-
thias, that Matthias, holding the power of intspreting the
will of God, by dreams, visions, and
feelinggnvas
able to
direct her thoughts and actions, and there re we do not
give her all the credit she takes for overcoming difficulties;
and we doubt if the subject was not anticipated ,by Matthias.
Now between the time of her declaration to him on the
evenings noticed on the 68th page of the first part, and her
departure for New York to get her husband's consent to give
her upto Matthias, as she supposed according to the will
of God, Matthias was washed by Mrs. Folger; and so much
time was
occupied in this operation as to excite the remark
of a child, Elizabeth Pierson, then only ten years of age,
who observed, that "Father would be clean enough this
time." Isabella had fetched the water, and had supposed
that Mr. Pierson would have assisted Matthias, for that was
the custom; but when Matthias had gone into the room,
Mrs. Folger opened the doora little way, and said "Father,
shall Iwash you," and just after went in: and this was
not done secretly, it was known to the whole household
then at Sing-Sing, and excited the remark of the child, as
before stated. We have seen this child; but we avoided di-
rect inquiry, for we have seen some of her relations and
friends, to whom she communicated at her pleasure, and at
different times, this and various other facts, We thought,
and still think, that we have more dependance on facts be-
ing thus confirmed, than by any direct inquiry of a
child;
our object was to get the truth, and if this child related to
different persons, the same account of what she had seen,
and that when such information was not sought for, a reli-
ance might be placed on it; especially when it confirmed
tho same facts before known. This washing of Matthias
dill not
greatly excite the household or kingdom, although
lsabella had her own
thoughts of if, as she before expressed
herself: the fact is, the kivzgzlom had been prepared for it,

bythe sentiments before noticed; and it only suppoaedthat
heas the Father, and she, about to be the Mother, had ar~
rived at a-greater degree of perfection than other members
of the kingdom Our opinion is, but it is only an opinion,
that on this occasion, Matthias and Mrs. Folger washed
each other, as a sort of purification preparatory tothe union
they were about to fomi, and as a
ceremony accompanying
the contract formed, agreeable to, an opinion before ex-
pressed. Matthias had no
set or written rules for the king-
dom; we have to pick up his doctrines, and connect them
with his practice how we can. He never committed any
thing to writing; and therefore we cannot get at the exact
rule for this washing: but as we find the practice intro~
duced on other similar occasions, and as this is not only
the most charitable, but the only rational supposition for such
a.
departure from common practice, or indeed decency,
we adopt it, as a
supposition, viz, that Matthias and 'Mrs.
B. Folger, assuming, and perhaps believing that they were
pure, had no occasion for masks of shame, and perhaps as
a trial oftheir faith, hadsought to subdue their passions in
the greatest temptations However, we ha,ve nothing to do
at present with reflection, we give only the fact, and for this
fact we have ample evidence: the interpretation ,too of Isa-
bella, is, that Matthias and Mrs. Folger assumed to be fun
ther advanced in purity than the others of the kingdom,
and therefore could do this, while the rest, at this time,
were washed by those of their own sex.
We have now then supplied one ofouromissions; and in
doing it we have effected another object: we have shown
that we have white evidence, that Mrs. B. Folger first coa-
ceived and brought to bear her union with Matthias. The
public press has not confronted us in one single point:
ut in private, we have heard the remark, that we rested
our evidence that Mrs. B. Folger ,seduced (an expression
we did not use in the `Iirst part) Matthias, on the credit of
a coloured woman; and although we had given other evi~
dence for other important facts, for this, we had not; and
that it was so incredible, that they never could .believe it.
This was said by a bookseller, who knew the Folger's, and

who thin discredit: our
judgment or honesty. We have now
given ltimvnnd-¥others» white evidence in this fact, in
person ot Mrs. Thompson, wstmnger to us and friendly
with-Mrs;fB1 Folger; sndfthfis evidence comes to us from
a very diferent channel -than -the other -which eoulirml,

and there are yet other evidences to be had, if we wautu#
them: indeed our
strongest proofs are sometimes-reserved,
both as a matter of policy in case of a denialof any pan we
have stated, and to avoid inserting names
unnecessarily; but
the identifying Mrs. B. ~Folgor as the author of Bl note ad-
dressed to Mr. Pierson, ee
pages 28 and 29 ofthe first part,
calculated to induce that gentleman to seek to obtain amat-
ried lady as a companion, ought to have been presumptive
evidence that in the same spirit Mrs. B. Folger could ne
gotiate for herself ~
~ '
-
We shall now supply another omission, made indeed in
the same
spirit. If our readers will turn to page 79, first part.,
they will find the marriage ceremony of Mr. B. Folger
and Mrs. Laisdell mentioned. '1'his was not done justiceto:
we shall take the liberty of going over the scene again, and;
~then connecting a subject with it; before omitted.
Mr. B. Folger, it will he recollected, went to Albany to,
fetch Matthias' daughter; and that he slept with her,awom~
panied with circumstances before named, on the road home'
and thatchdatthias, to whom this fact was confessed, assumed
it þÿ8S_fll ¬
base of his proceedings, alleging that as her
former marriage was nullified by this act, she had better
marry, or be espoused to Mr. B. Folger, as their affection'
for each other showed a kindred spirit. This was what law~
yers call profiting by the wrong done: while the fact of ll
courtship to n
married woman, a consummation, a
marriage,
and then another consummation, all in three days, is ceri
tainly 'incomprehensibleto persons of ordinar faith and
1
ordinary morals. For such things an
extraordlinary iiiith
or revelation is necessary, or we must suppose gross and*
corrupted murals. The linetof conducthaving been

festive party; and proceeded to thehont parlour. ln this
parlour, theparty took their seats, in the followingorder :-
Mr. Pierson near the end of the rodni opposite the win-
dows; then in order, opposite the fire, Mr. B. Folger, Mrs.
Laisdcll,`(the daughter 'of Matthias) and Matthias; Mrs.
B. Folger took a
place by the side ofthe fire next the win-
dow, and Catherine Galloway on the other side, with her
head crouching under the mnntelpiece, and her eyes occa-
sionally learing towards the happy pair, Mr. B, Folger and
Mrs. Laisdell, '£`lf0,Ih01,lgh she had been
improperly whip-

among them, hut ad-
mirably situated lor observation. Mntthiasbegan by ex-
plaiuinglhe circumstance, without, however, mentioning
particulars, and it is probable that all the facts already stated
were not then known, except to Mr. and Mrs. B. Folger
and Matthias. Matthias simply stated, that rw act on the
road had nullified his daughters marriage with herhus-
band Laisdell; and this being nullified, and Mr. B. Folger
alidlhis daughter being fond of each other, he thought the
'best thing they could do was to unite, or be espoused. He
fthen asked Mr. BJ Fol er" and his daughter* if they were
willing* to be thus tinitedé these cheerfhlly replied they were.
'He then asked Mr. Pierson, if he gave his consent; to which

by
the slow yes.
'The same qustion 'was then put to Isabe la, who replied,
es., ,_
Matthias then put his hand upon the head ofMrs.B»
Fo] er and his dau hter, and said, "
You will be blessed in
obeehence, and in disobedience thou wilt be cursed,"
Mr. B. Folger then kissed the bride, and then kissed Mat~
thias, then Mr. Pierson, Mrs. B. Folger, Catherine, and
lastly Isabella, the door-keeper and cook in the kingdom.
This kiss was afterward referred to by Isabella, before the
grand jury at White Plains, who asked her, if Matthias
had ever kissed her: and on her
replying, yes, one of
thi?
asked, "
Now, didn't he kiss sweet?
'
To which she repli ,
"
No sweeter than Ben. Folger ;" for she
supposed
Mr. B.
Folger to have suggested this question, as. he ad just been
in the room. The grand jury, on this reply, declined push-
ingrtheir inquiries.
After this kissing ceremony, Mr. B. Folger showed a
disposition to retire, with his new bride; he supposed the
ceremony closed: but Matthias was in a preaching humour,
and commenced a lecture, ,which if they were not obliged
to listen to, they were at least obliged to sit under. We
do not think it was
_very edifying, or else it was
apparently
badly timed; ~for he certainly did not get the attention of
some of the part : Catherine remained immoveable, her
head in the usual'place, and her eyes, when engaged, were
stealing a dissatisfied look at the happy pair! while Mr.
B. Folger manifested a most ridiculous uneasiness, almost
starting up at every period, apparently hoping it vas the
last. He had been alone on the previous evening, and
manifested the greatest anxiety to retire with his wife, to
the great amusement of Isabella, who seemed, like the rest,
not much occupied with the prophet's discourse, but enga-
ged in watching the countenances, and trying to catch the
thoughts of the party. Matthias, alone, seemed charmed
with his own voice, and with the greatest deliberation was
laying down moral rules, and giving s iritual advice to
those whose minds were not apparently then in a
very api-
ritual mood. At length, the prophet ceased, and Mr. B. Fol-
ger led off his blooming bride, we cannot say blushing,

iu' she had been married one month before to_a
V
'c
in Albany, named Laisdell, whom she had just l on a
'friendly visit to her father. , _Z _'
`,We return now to the kitchen. The subject of this mar-
ria e
necessarily became a
topic of conversation between
.Caiierine and Isabella, who was not acquainted with all
the facts then. Ignorant people can
only talk about what
they see and hear, and on these subjects they are
always
talking: when they have said all they know, then the
begin again; and thus an ignorant person is easily detected:
if a liar. Catherine's mind was
evidently full of the sub-
ject, and when She answered, therefore, on the last occasion,
in so doleful a manner, and appeared so thoughtful and
dull, with her head pertinaciously stuck under the mantel-
piece,
"
Good God!" inwardly exclaimed Isabella, "
does
Catherine think any thing of Benjamin Folger!" It struck
her, as we learn by inquiry, for the first time, that Cathe
rine had pretensions to Mr. B. Folger; and this, it appears,
surprised Isabella; for Catherine is rather a homel young-
woman, the widow of a
serving man to' Mr. Mills, and
herself formerlya servant to him. She is uneducated, with-
out polish in her manners, and as Isabella expressed her-
self] only fit to be in the kitchen with her. Catherine could
not help talking, nor Isabella inquiring, till at length, Ca-
therine declared that she had a greater right to Mr. B. Fol-
ger than Mrs. Laisdell, for that Mr. Folger had lain with
her in the house in Third-street, New-York, several times,
since he had given up his wife, (about six veeks,) and that.
too by the apparent consent or knowlodge of Mrs. B. Fol-
ger, who had perhaps innocently prepared the way. It
appears, that Mrs. B. Folger, after her marriage with Mat-
thias, went to New-York, and communicated the joyful
intelligence to Catherine, as one of the kingdom. She had
explained to Catherine hov that the Spirit ofthe Lord had
made known to her, that she should take Matthias, as her
match spirit.
'
Her visions, dreams, and feelings, were ex~
plained, as the leadings or guiding of the Spirit of God.
Catherine in relating these facts 'to Isabella, said that she
pitied Mr. B. Folger, especially as she then recollected the

j 'kpiilsqgatbgbte it; was is dining the timé flats. ldiifizdger
was sblicitinghis consent to her u`nion with Matthias, and
which she_then did not understand;
`
but as' 4*
pity melts the
mind tohlove," it appears to have been the _case with Cathe-
rine; for the same sort of spirit that had operated on Mrs.
Folger, began to operate on Catherine: and she began to
dream, had visions, and strange feelings, which convinced
her that she was a match spirit for Mr. B. Folger. So
powerful was this spirit in Catherine, that she rolled 'on the
ground
with its violence, and became extremely uneasy in
er
person; and
perhaps
like her instructor, the Mother in
the kingdom, included ust with the workings of the spirit;
for that lady distinctly admitted, that previous to her union
with Matthias, she was all on a ferment, or tovuse the ex-
pression of St. Paul, that she burned. `This proof of the
error
arising from feelings, we hefore omitted, for reasons
before given. Whatever were the exact feelings of Cathe-
rine, her situation wasexplained to Matthias, and he ad~
mitted their genuineness,' and supposed that Folger and
Catherine were matched spirits; and that it was the will of
God that they should be united, and as such he sanctioned
it, although there must then have existed a
treaty for his
daughter to be given to Mr. Folger. Now, whether this
fact was made known to Mr. B. Folger by Catherine, or
bv Mrs. B. Folger, we do not know; but we know that
'Mrs B. Folger assisted Catherine in her wardrobe. and in
'the improvemuit of her personal appearance. 'One gar-
'rnent purchased for Catherine was
afterward appropriated
to the use of Matthias' daughter, Catherine, it appears,
was
really fond of Mr, B. Folger; she had known the
bliss of matrimony, nor did she discover those deficiencies
in him which Mrs. B. Folger so
frequently referred to, in
comparison to Matthias. Catherine was
conscious of the
inferiorit of her personal appearance, in taste and face, to
the daughter of Matthias; but she fiattered herself that she
'was not less acceptable to Mr. Folger, and actually once
`rnade the ridiculous proposal to Isabella, that she should
ask Mr, Folger which of the females he liked best in the

Pierson's house. just before the time of Matthias,
became the subject of discourse; Mr. Mills remarkedto this
effect: 'VI am for doing, not for talking; we have too much
talking and too little doing; Iwill kiss 'Isabella's feet,"
and suiting the action to the word, he forthwith kissed this
middle aged, not handsome coloured woman's foot.` The spi-
rit ofthe act was the result of generous and noble feelings,
but prostrated by fanaticism. We have this fact .from one of
his equals present, but confirmed by Isabella. Mr. Mills,
as a
disciple of Mr. Pierson or Matthias, was cheerful and
happy, and thus improved in that particular.
Mr. B. Folger was a
pool' lad with an ordinary educa-
tion, but brought up by rich relations of the same name, who
assisted him in getting forward in life. By becominga part~
ner in a
good house, he soon became rich, and respected as
one of the first
importing
merchants of hardware in New
York; but engaged in ot er speculating pursuits, especially
latterly. From his success in Business, and rather showy
style of living, he necessarily became connected with the
best society, and by being rather a handsome man, and ac-
quiring a
very polite manner, with considerable
knowledge
of business, and necessarily some knowledge of the wor d,
he effectually concealed rather a defective education; his
good temper, extreme politeness, kindness, for he' has for-
warded the interests of man
poor men and families, and
his generosity, chiefly in his religious connexion, esta-
blished ri strong feeling of sympathy in his favour, which
wouldhuve been respect, but for recent events, and but
for some vices and weaknesses in his character, which
counterbalance his virtues, and which recent events 'are
calculated to expose. Nine years ago this -gentleman be-
came a convert and made a
particular profession of religion,
and supported that profes ion by distributing tracts, attend-
ing Sunday-schools, prayer meetings, and meetings for ex-
perience, in which he expounded the Scriptures, and mani-
fested on all occasions the greatest sincerity; especially as
these religious exercises, and his connexion with a small
church at Greenwich, could not forward his temporal inter-
ests, while they cost him large sums, as subscripdbns to
various religious objects connected with them.

are the most persuasive possible; she
is gentleness i li; and ap rs to have been simple and
artless as a

became a zealous member of various religious societies
connected with charities, held prayer meetings in her house,
contributed to the establishment and conducting of Sunday-
sehools, explained the Scriptures, and became in every
sense an active, and sincere Christian; she, too, adopted
Mr. Pierson's opinion, and always regarded him as an in-
telligent, sincere,, and able man, even to the time of his
death. The other disciples of Matthias, or members of the
kingdom, were in more humble life, and not having the
required time or
money, could not be distinguished; except
Isabella, the coloured woman, who had previously been
noted in Mr. Latourette's meetings and at camp-meetings,
for long and loud preaching and praying, remarkable for
their influence in converting: she is well known among
the Methodists, and while amongst them, or known to
them, was much respected by them. Mr. Latourette as-
sured us the influence of her speaking was
rniracnlo,u§;that
even learned and respectable people were running after
her; and she even commanded a
larger audience than the
celebrated Mallet, when both were preaching on the same
ground, at the same time. The rest were Christians of
good repute, with one exception.

Tan party, or
Kingdom as
it was called, appeared now
feetly hapfmy; even Catherine seemed to forget her neg-
eet, though she possibly received some private consolation:
Mr. B. Folger was
then living in the same llamily with
three females, whom he had enjoyed as a
husband; and his
wife, with two men
whom she had successivel. taken as
husbands. She was warmly attached to Matt ias. alter
their union, and the siibject of her bliss formed n constant
topic ofconversation. `
She regarded all former connexions
as nothing, and notonly supposed, but declared, thqt she
never lcnewge man but Matthias For this fact. we have
legal white evidence, and we instance it only to show the
strength of the delusionmand the effect of ,BGDHYPNIY on the
mind. Of Matthias she spoke with enthusiasm; and, like
the followers of Mahomet, regarded him as
supernatural,
physically and mentally; i
he, she remarked 'on several oc-
casions, and to dferent persons, could "enter the most
'Holy of Holy," und "
penetrate to the Sanctum Sanctorum,"
sptfqking, ye Sttppose, oflxis understanding. "These were
the precise temis used., and re rted to= us by different per-
shns,`whh nevericould have tlligught of agreeing in these
-expxelsmng if not mae; while, at the same time; we have no

reason to doubt the truth of those whom we have never de
mesa' ga "e1sahaoa; and' whose eaimony, as in turner,
ease; lissuppaned by' other evidme, gt-im whom 'she was
not corincctedg Matthias, too, was" evidently* in love;'in
spite- of his stetniness, "his prophetic character, Wand dwpdéh
sign, which, we think, he frequently maniksté-cl. He cull#
ed her by all endearing names: she would hang upon his
neck, and at her instigation he took up her petty causes or
discontent' in the kitchen; listened to her complaints, and
scolded Isabella' in good set terms, even about washing;
and committed all the follies that young love is capable of;
which, as Isabella had no match spirit in the establishment,
she had' more opportunity, and felt more disposed to notice.
What she' formerly considered as spiritual attentions, she
now
perceived to be the beginning of camal attachments.
Such was 'his affection for her, and such it continued, that
at al later period, after the death of Mr. I"i::rson, Matthias,
when in thehabit of pacing the passage in the Third-street
house,'fre<pzéntly stopped at the front of a closet in that pas-
sage, and oolring steadfastly at some of her garments, hang-
ing there, has been seen to embrace them, and once was
seen to kiss them.` And nov we
may so far anticipate the
narrative, as to say, that this reality of practical love, be-
tween Matthias and Mrs. B. Folger, is the key which un-
locks the mystery about the neglect of Mr. Pierson. He
was
neglected, because the only two persons who had nu-
thority in the house, were
courting or
spending a
long
honeymoon. For the same reason, Mr. Folger could not
get hisbreakfast in time, but was sometimes pacing the
passage, and waiting for Matthias and Mrs. B. Folger, com-
ing out of their bedroom. The work of the house was
thrown back by their delays in the morning, and by Mrs.
B. Folger clo'ing'less household
emplogient,
and spending
large portions of her timetoying with atthias. This had
nearly caused Isabellafs leaving the Kingdom, as she did
nearly all the hard work, and received no wages; but had
all things in' common. Her duty, however, was in the
kitchen, and when she 'once complained, especially of the
late
breakfasts, that it threw her back in her work, she rs-

ceived this characteristic reply,viz. : "
that she should he fur-
nished with his and Mother's `rit, so that if the laid in
bed, their spirits should be wigher, and enable der to do
twice the work in half the time." This was said to Isabel-
la in Matthias' bedroom, where he and Mrs. Folger were
then in bed; for as the fire was lighted in their room before
they got up, she was
frequently there while they vere in
bed. This anecdote, more than any other, has raised a
doubt in us both as to the sincerity of Matthias and Mrs.
Folger, who admitted the excuse, and frequently repeated
it. Setting aside sincerity, it was certainlya good joke u
on a coloured woman, and calculated to induce her to db
more labour with less opportunities. It was.a good trick
to subdue her dissatisfaction' but it certainly also disturbed
her faith: both in that andthe love affair, she had no faith;
she did not believe in the coming of a holy child, where so
much carnal affection and weakness were shown; nor did
she believe in a double spirit, when self-indulgence dictated
the liberal donation.
Mr. Pierson was
happy in anticipation; he was decid-
edly uxorious; his deep affection for his wife was founded
in constitution and desire, as well as in the mind. His form
was what phrenologists call amative; and of these facts
we have some
very curious proofs. His affections were,
héwever, concentrated wholly on his wife; and hence his
extreme grief at her loss. To this loss his friends attribute
his after sicknessfaccompanied with Hts, and his strange
hallucination of mind on religious subjects ; for he continued
apparently of sou'nd mind, for all secular purposes. His
sincerity and religious faith, and code ofmorals, forbid the
indulgence of his passions aher his wife's death, while the
strength of those passions constantly reminded him of his
loss: the proof of this fact, is in our possession, but cannot
with propriet be published. Nor did his grief for his wife
subside, till he conceived the agreeable but curious idea
that her spirit would occupy another body; and that he
should againbe united to her in another fonn: and this
delusion was
strengthened by Mrs. B. Folger in every
way. The lady referred to, who was the innocent subject of
rraxnrrtva or isAnt»:r.La. 25
this imaginar transfer of spirit, was alike ignorant of the
workings of both the minds of Mrs. _B. Folger and Mr.
Pierson, till we
pointed out the connexion between Mrs. B."
Folger's two notes, mentioned in our first part, and Mr.
Pierson's direct application both to this lady and her hus-
band in the name of the Lord, to be given up to him. On
pointing out this connexion, and the fact that the subject
was
seriously entertained at Sing-Sing, by the leaders in
the kingdom, that lady suddenly exclaimed, "I see it," and
then mentioned that Mrs. B. Folger was the general con-
triver of their proximities; to which she then attached no
importance. Mr( Pierson then vas
happy, in the prospect
of this union, which he imagined was the vill of God: he
made several visits to this lady, but being naturally modest,
except on the last occasion, merely invited her to Sing-Sing;
but his pretensions to this lady, we knov to have been en-
couraged by Mrs. B. Folger, if not by the other inmates of
Sing-Sing.
Happy as the parties now were, it wants very little pene-
tration to perceive that in that society were the elements of
disorder, and frightful consequences; the machinery vas
imperfect and had not worked vell, and some disappoint-
ments seemed calculated to prostrate the whole plan, and
defy the bold efforts of Matthias to keep the kingdom in
peace, composed as it vas. The most unfortunate affair
seemed to be the previous marriage of Matthias' daughter.
The reader may easily perceive that the first squall would
come from that quarter. Mrs. Laisdell had left her home,
with her brothers, on a visit to their father; the mother had
refused tocome, and the daughter was to have informed
her' of the situation of her husband, and prospectof the fam-
ily. In the ardour of love or
passion these difficulties appear
to have been jumped over, and Matthias solemnly sealed
these difficulties b the formal union, at which he assisted;
apparently regardlessofconsequences. After this marriage,
which took place in the winter of 1833, the family lei

apparent secreting, even in the kingdom, is
not very favourable to the supposition of positive sincerity,
or consciousness of right,
The union of Mr., B. Folger with Mrs. ,Laisdell had;
-t.tl:.=n place early in January, 183-43 no information was
ser.: to Mrs. Martthiusifor three weeks, and then only a mea-
gre note from Mr. B. Folger, informingher that the children
were well, and no more
money would be sent, as Mat/thias
disapproved it; (Mr. D, Folger had promised to send money
monthly.) But in this note no notice was taken of Mrs.
?.»ti:i<l=:ll ; this we learn from Mrs. Matthias. On the receipt
og' this note, it appears the husband, Mr. Laisdell, set out
tor Sing-Sirrsif. On his arrival there, he was not permitted to
-enter the house, i1;;;:r in charge of Isabella, who acted un-
der _qerzvrril instructions. Laisdell was an English me-
cliarri-:, a conrbmalrer, not very exulzc-fi in his notions of
dignity, and pcrirzrps a little awed :at the elegance of the
house, and the supposed wcztlth and power of the party's
circumstances, which would not affect a Yankee in low
circurnstunces. I-Ie obtained nothing satisfactory from Isa-
bella, who could not be faithful to both parties; and as she
was

oivn responsibility: she therefore kept him at bay for two
lfiys, and on the third sent word to the family at New
York, that Laisdell had come; and in the mean time gave
htm no
satisfactory answer. Not being permitted to enter
the house in the absence of the proprietors, he endeavoured.
to attract' the attention of Matthias' sons, then inthe house
-or_ garden, and learn from them what he in vain sought of
Is'abcl'|a; while she, who has much energy, considerable
siirewdness, and great strength of body, endeavoured to keep
the boys out of his way. The manmuvres of these parties at
xhis time, must have attracted the attention of the villagers;

Laisdell's arrival at Sing-Sing, Mr. Pierson and Matthias
then in NewYork, came up to Sing-Sing, still leaving Mr-
B. Folger _and his newly-acquired bride, Mrs, Laisdell, in
New York, to make the most of their time. On their arri~
val, Laisdell was admitted into the house, but lsahella was
seriously scolded by Matthias for not treating Laisdell more
sevferel , and for sending for them: for whatever he might
think, lie behaved as if he had a
right to
give this man's-
wife away to Mr. B. Folger, and as if the other ought tot
Submit without grumbling. Pierson, however, gave him
money, and made several propositions to hint; one ofwhiclx
was that he should return to England to see his friends, for
which purpose money should be provided; another was,
that he should return to
Albany, purchase instruments and
the raw materials, and that he should then come again to
Sing-Sing, and set up business, for which money should be
provided: and to this lust he assented, without ever
seeing
,his wife. And while these arrangements were in progress,
he made himself comfortable, chiefly, however, in the kitch-
en; where he became very talkative, even to his old enemy,
Isabella, who had kept him at bay during the absence of'
the family. Matthias, too, lectured him considerably, speak-A
ing to him with authority mixed with kindness; himself'
assuming a
superiority, and treating Laisdell like a
boy,
who ought to submit without trouble. Vhut they told him
about his wife, we don't know; but we do know that he
was neither invited to New York, nor was there any inten-
tion of bringing her to Sing-Sing, nor did they explain to
him how she was situated. In two or three days Lalsdell.
was

sincerity, with the strange expectation that this husband,
being thus engaged, would quietly give up his wife, and
remain in the same neighbourhood, and perhaps become
one of the family, or kingdom, we know not; but this
iict, together with the fact of Matthias sending for his wife
and
family
to be similarly situated, has always struck,us
as a proo of his sincerity, and, at the same time, of his as-
surance, his consummate impudence, and high opinion of
himself: for no man, without a conceit reaching almost to
madness, would think of sending for a wife, childrernygqd
son-in-law, while he and his daughter were living
interchange of matrimonial enjoyments with others -in the
same house. However, the fact is positive, and our readers
must draw what conclusions they please. Laisdell lefhthe
house for Albany without his wife, and Matthias returned
to New York, leaving Mr. Pierson at Sing-Sing. `-
After the lapse of a few days, when it was supposed ihat
Laisdell was in Albany, Isabella discovered a figure like
him, idling on the road near the house, and talking to af
neighbour, Mr. Hatfield;and Isabella pointing him out to
Mr. Pierson; that gentleman went to look after him, and
found that it really was Laisdell himseli the real Simon
Pure. Mr. Pierson brought him home, dined him, pretended
to believe his tale, (of his being too late for the coach, &c.)
and gave him more money, and took him down to Sing-
Sing, in order to see him in a fair way of starting; but af.
ter Mr. Pierson leti him, he altered his tact, under advice
previously given. His manners and habits certainly did
not command respect; it was evident he liked beer quite
as well as his wife; and it was
equally clear, that he was
foolish enough to enter into a strange engagement, and'
unfaithful enough to break it. Still his sta in the village
excited much curiosity, and himself a
goodydeal of sympa.
thy; perhaps, too, he did not tell how he got the
money he
was spending. The whole village appeared excited:
crowds walked out to see the house; but all was
mystery
within. Laisdell at len h applied to law; and set out for

pleasure ofthe people fell, while Mr. B. Folger, the most
eulpable in this case, not only escaped their violence, but
was enabled to protect Matthias. Tho family. including
Mrs. B. Folger and Mrs. Laisdell, who was
vc-ry unwill»
ing to leave Sing-Sing, determined to prolong' her stay. if
possible. They relied on the promise of Laisdell, to come
there and live, and on the wishes ot' Mrs. Laisdell, to ne,
main; and this evidence she gave in court, concealing the
real case, by stating that she preferred staying with her
brothers, and wished her husband to come there to live,~ai
he had promised 1 but Laisdell, being unwilling, and prnv~
ing his marriage by a certifieate, obtained his wife; and
set off for Albany, from whence he had been absent threa
weeks. Thus Mr. B, Folger retained possession of Mrs.
Laisdell' about six weeks from the day of her leaving' A|»
hany, in January, 1834, to her return.

facts were confirmed, as lézr as was known outside »tha

aherward returned home, the younger, John, mentioned
the case of Mr. Folger sleeping with his sister on the road;
but these boys, and the men engaged chiefly out of doors
on the farm, were not generally intimate with the in-door
transactions.
As to the family, a different fate awaited them. _Matthias
continued to be mobbed, and it required all the energy of
Mr. and Mrs. Folger to protect him from personal violence.
The next day Messrs. Voris and Prime, (the former a
respectable lawyer, and the latter_a teacher in Sing-Sing,)
visited Mr. B. Folger, in the morning, for the purpose of
offering their friendly aid and advice, and anxiously desir-
ing the dismissal of Matthias, as the supposed cause of the
various suspicions: for 'some of the bolder people now de-
clared their belief of the facts we have related; viz. that
Matthias had taken Mrs. B. Folger; and Mr. B. Folger,
Matthias' daughter, even though a married woman! Isa-
bella saw these gentlemen approaching the house, and know-
ing that Matthias and Mrs. Folger were yet in bed, and to-
gether! and being unwilling, as she expressed herself; that
they should be caught in this situation--for their connexion,
though known to the kingdom, was not acknowledged to
the world, or among' the devils, as the whole family, in
imitation of Matthias, were accustomed to call other people:
and in this, perhaps, Matthias gave more offence to many
individuals than by his associations;-Isabella being un~
willing that they should be so
caught, hastened into their
room, to which she had access, as before explained, and
gave the necessary information: on which, Mrs. B. Folger
hurriedly assumed her garments; while Isabella went to
call Mr. B. Folger, also in hed. .He and Mrs. B. Folger
then 'received their visiters, and not'very kindl declined
their services; in fact, they considered their ofliirs as oh-
trusive: the parties had then no wish to alter their circum-
stances, and regarded advice, out of the kingdom, as the
advice of devils.
_
After the departure of Mrs. Laisdell, Mr. B. Folger re-
turned to Catherine Galloway, with the knowledge and
assistance of Mrs. B. Folger, who again discoveredthat they

were latched spirits: she assisted in making np clothes for
her, and adorned her naturally rather plain person in the
best manner; and apparently took so much interest in her
happiness, as to inquire after her wedded enjoyments, as
proofs of their being matched spirits. This extreme atten-
tion to personal pleasures, among the adults, led to a par-
tial neglect of others in the household, or kingdom, at a
later period. 'I'hus Mr. Pierson's daughter was made to
wear some garments made from rejected clothes of Cathe-
rine, afier Catherine dressed well, and spent a
large por-
tion of her time in the parlour; while this child, then 'only
ton years old, did considerable of the chamber-work, and
even washed the outside stoop to their handsome establish-
ment; which, ve
suppose, Catherine would have done had
there been less love. We do not know that this union was
known or approved by Mr. Pierson, as before espressed, at
least there is no proof of it: it vas not openly avowed; but
it was the frequent subject of conversation between Cathe-
rine and Isabella, and
occasionally
mentioned or referred
to by Mrs. B. Folger, to one or ot er or both together, of
the other two. Catherine slept avowedly with Elizabeth,
Mr. Pierson's daughter, the child before mentioned, in the
north wing; Mr. B. Folger slept over Matthias' room, and
Matthias and Mrs. Folger slept in the front
parlour.
Ca-
therine used to get from her bed, leaving the c ild, and went
up to Mr. B. Folger's room: this the child not only knew,
but talked about; it is true she was but a child, but we
think Mrs. B. Folger, who had the charge of this child,
ought not to have placed her in such a situation.
With regard to several members of the kingdom, no e-
crecy was attempted. At a late period, in Third-street,
Isabella wotfld frequentl _go into Mr. Folger's room with
Catherine, and remain there till Mr. B. Folger
camigp,
when she retired, and saw the door locked on them ,
no reserve being thought necessary in her case: The con-
sequence, too, of this intercourse was a miscarriage on the
part of Catherine; which unfortunately occurred in the
parlour, in a fiill meeting of the kingdom, when Matthias
was lecturing. As this was a
very early miscarriage, it

It does not
appear that Mr. B. Folger was ever fond1oL`
Catherine, but took her merely asa
suhstitute; or,- as 'Isa-
bella coarsel y expresses hcrscll, as a hack. Catherinefon
the contrary, appears to have been extremely hund1of=Mr,»B.
Folger: he was indeed a handsome man, but ra:/her effem-

was a woman of no conversation, nor of any qualifications
but those fit for the kitchen. The consequencetwas, avdis-
satisfaction on the part of Mr. B. Folger; he found.1that=he
had given up an
extremely pleasing female to his bearded
friend ; -and got, in exchange, a woman vhom hedid not
value. In _spite of 'Mrs B. Folger's and Cnt.hefin'els dis-
covering that Catherine was the match spirit to Benjamin,
as Mrs, B. Folger used to call her husband,) this dissatis-
_qction was shown, hy Mr. B. Folger, not' towards1Cuthe-
rine, buttowards Matthias and Mrs. ~B. Folger, whom he
now
evidently wished to recover. This, we have no doubt,
was foreseen by Mrs. B. Folger; and hence her anxiety to
adorn Catherine, fand _to please her husband through her,
for in all these transactions, besides the tcachingslof the
Spirit, we
generally perceive some human passion or prin-
ciple at work, to' which thc teachings of the Spirit seem
subservient. Indeed this is the danger of the doctrine _of

and hurricanes: while the terms of peace were often curi-
ous, and quite characteristic, involving singular violations
of decorum, and curious reasonings and self-deceptions, to
reconcile practices even to an altered code of morals. In~
dulgences were granted to Mr. B. Folger by Mrs.,B. Fol-
ger, as the terms of peace; but these will be illustrated as
we
progress in this singular narrative.
i
In the sprin of 1833, the kingdom was increased by a
hmily from Albany. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, (before
mentioned,) with their young children, joined them, as an
experiment. Mr. Thompson was a combmalrer in Albany;
he had seen Matthias there, and knew something of ,him:
he heard of the wealth of the arties at Sing-Sing through
Matthias' wife, Laisdell, and) the family; and ln- h< ld
some peculiar notions about the advantages of living in the
country and in families. About March, or soon aher Mrs.
Laisdell had returned home, he visited Sing-Sing, and then
made arrangements to bring his family and be admitted
into the kingdom; he to be employed about the farm, and his
wife in needle-work. We have seen both the husband and
wife, but at different periods, and not in each other's pre-
sence, but in the presence of other persons. Mr. Thomp-
son does not rofess to have believed in the supernatural
character of ll/lliitthias; but he had no
objection to the prin-
ciple, that heaven should be upon earth, or that men should
be as comfortable as
possible; and that large families were,
by united efforts, best calculated to effect that object. He
had no objection to some of the doctrines of Matthias, and
could see no great harm in Matthias holding any curious
notions, provided he was at liberty himself; and nothing
more required of him but hearing ; at least, he was willin
to make the trial; and his wife necessarily came along with
him, without any particular profession. Mr. Thompson did
not know, at first, the connexion between Matthias and Mrs.
B. Folger, nor that between Mr. B. Folger and Catherine,
when he took his family. He soon, however, made these
discoveries; but at first flattered himself that his wife could
not see them, and consequently would remain with a mind
uncontaminated; and he even reproved her for some obser-
34 iunn/rrrvn or xsumnu.
yations she made, which raised _a suspicion'uf',tlia!'HHd.
T`Iius'he'fluttered himself on his own shrewdneél# _
le
she made far greater discoveries than he did; but' y
made a
timely retreat, after some initiating instructi'oh§"
"
'
Mrs. Thompson had all to. learn and much to`disebV§r.
She soon perceived that Mrsf B. Folger did not 'sléepwith
her husband: she next observed, that there was bt1t"<9ne
chamber in which she could sleep, unless with Matthias;
and in' that chamber china was
placed on the bed after usi ;
and she was much struck to find the china apparently in
the same position on a successive morning. In ot'dei"to
satisfy herself on this point, this lady, with very natural
curiosity, made an experiment. She placed some
pieceiof
china in a
particular position on the bed; and then iierféu-
riosity was satisfied, by finding, on the following day, those
pieces retained precisely the same
position. Thus, while
Mr. Thompson was
flattering himself on his superior
shre\fdness, and was very cunning to keep his wifeyinithe
dark, :she had actually proved what he had only suspected.
This experiment was, however, wholly unnecessaryp time
union of Matthias with Mrs. B. Folger became a
snbject'_of`
conversation afterward, between the latter and Mrs,'I'hQ¥f1p-
son, as Mrs. Tliompson says; to her Mrs. B. Folgerfac-
knowledgvd, that the union was of her seeking-fthat she
had seen the two volumes of smoke unite in one+that she
had visions, and that God instructed her how to act; add,
as we before observed, advised Mrs. Thompson to go' toitiie
father (Matthias) for interpretations, if she (Mrsffhompson)
had visions, dreams, &c. To her Mrs. B. Folger declared
the superior powers of Matthias, and aflirmed that there
was no man but him, and that even her husband was a
man: and such open avowals, based upon divine
teaclriiigs,
or impressions, admitted, of course, of questions l)CiI`tg_fli k-
ed, and some would very naturally arise. Thus
Thompson asked, "But vhen you go to New-York, where
your husband is, do you not sleep with him?"

Soon after,'1`hompson came to Sing-Sing, (he believes on

_
Folger, and a
singular termination. Ol' course we can
only 'relate a
portion of what took place. Mr. B. Folger's
discontent, on this occasion, rose to such a height, that he
denied Matthias' right to Mrs. Folger, and high words
arid` angry feelings ensued: but as Mr. B. Folger had a,
legalclaim to the lady, Matthias could use only spiritual
weapons; and he alternately denounced judgments. with a
high hand and a
strong voice, and appealed to the sympa-
thy of Mr. B. Folger, and to his religious faith. The fam-
ily, it appears, had received anonymous letters, threaten-
iri _Matthiasjand treating him as an
irnpostor; and Mr. B.
#Qi ' y' _in his angry moments, applied similar epithets.

documents, thrust

and then upon Mr. B. Folger and others who had not £.ith
in his rophetic character; he cursed also the quills, and
goose that supplied the quills for these writings. This
scene, however, thus terminated.
lt isevidenti Matthias could not retain Mrs. B. Folger by
violence, and these paroxysms of passion and curses only
served to subdue the spirit of Mr. B. Folger, and perhaps
allay his passion by the creating of fear, lest he should
really be o
posing God's anointed. Matthias appealed to
his sensibillities and to his o\'n~
superior character: and
when all was calm, Matthias solemnly observed, "
I grieve
in the spirit for a bosom companion." Some conversation
then arose with him and Mr. B. Folger about the object;
when Matthias declared, that there was but one
person of
sufficient purity of mind for him, or suitable to his charac-
ter, in fact his match spirit, and that was Mrs. B. Folger.
Matthias added, "
You know I have declared Ann (Mrs.
B. Folger) to be the Mo'r|~urn." To this Mr. B. Folger
replied,
"
Thy will be done ;" and Matthias rejoined,
"
I
have not found such great faith, no, not ,in Israel." And
Mrs. B. Folger was thus a second time deliberately given
up to Matthias by her husband's consent; and the covenant
was sealed by the ceremony of washing or
baptizing: and
Mr. B. Folger was, on this occasion, solemnly washed, in
the manner before described, by the conjoiut services of
Matthias and Mrs. B. Folger, and this was known to the
whole household. The washing part is, indeed, the only
portion that Isabella has spoken to, as the rest ,took place
in the parlour while she was in the kitchen; but she knew
the rest by report, which accorded with the information we
had received from other sources.
While Thompson was there, another occurrence took
place, to which he attaches some importance, but in which
wefcan see nothing but a good dinner, A fatted calf was
ready for the knife, and Matthias choseto make it a time of
rejoicing and amusement. He called the ,season a feast,
and Mr. Thompson one of the Levites, andordained him
butcher on the occasion. The fatted calf was killed, various
Scripture` names were given to the parties. and the flesh

Henry, a young Englishman, now in Ohio, and, from his
long residence, acquainted with most of these facts. Cathe
rine and Isabella were also there ;-the latter taking the head
of the-lable, next to Matthias, by invitation, as, from acci=
dent, every other place was lilledbefore she came to the
table. =0! juniors, tht-rc were Matthias' children; Eliza-

Thisfeast received a Scriptural nurne, but we do not iden=
'mify it with any fixed principle, belief, or
practice.
In June, l834, an event occurred which immediately do-
cided Mr. Thompson on leaving the kingdom, after a str
juumof little more than three weeks. Matthias, his son,
and Mr. und Mrs. Folger, were returning to Sing-Sing,
hmm New York, in their carriage, vhen an accident oc-
curred, and the carriage broke down, some distance from
.Yonkers Matthias took advantage of this circumstance,
as he did: of most others, to enforce his authority. His son
haddvaen appointed driver, but Mr. B. Folger chose to con-
duct the carriage, and vas in the act of driving when tho
accident occurred; and to this act of disobedience Matthias
ascribed the mischance. With him every one in the '_
was otniaiued to some
duty or office, and any deviation fr
this, was considered an act ofdisobedience. We believe lid

on the same door provided other beds, for _
'
rine, and the boy. We have, since then, seen ,¢§0`l ,
'and obtained some facts from the landlord. Thus, without'
an
open declaration of the peculiar situation of the parties,
forwhich, it
appears, they were not
prepared, Mr. B. Fol~
ger was
oblige to sleep with his vife. We do not know
that Matthias laid him under any injunction, or heavy #cur-'
ses, as we believe he did on some other occasions, when
under trial of his faith; and when under these circum~
stances, he was permitted to enjoy the presence of his wife
in bed, but denied the privilegesof a husband, under the
sevcrest curses which Matthias could bestow, and the fear
of which, he supposed, would destroy passion or desire in
Mr. B. Folger; from which he then inferred the will of
God, that he, Mr. B. Folger, was not her match s `rit. We
Lclieve this to have been practised, but we do not linow the
consequences; Matthias, we
suspect,
deceived himself On
this occasion, 'Mr. B. Folger aboured under no curse
'
perhaps he contrived to keep in company till bedtime, and
thus avoided an
injunction. Matthias, however, pretended
to have confidence in him, and the parties went' to bed as
the landlord had arranged. In the morning Matthias cross~
ed the passage, opened the door of Folger's room, and de-
manded if "
all was well." Thus much we must have put
up with, had Mrs. Folger held her tongue; but Mrs.
Thompson-relates, that she told the affair to her; and add~
ed, that she felt utterly prostrate in the morning, with no
power to rise or get up, till Matthias assisted her: and we
believe she was going to say, until she was purified or
washed; but finding that she could not mention the subject
to her own mind, she
`
broke off declaring it impossible to
explain herself; indeed we found that she had
alreadgssaid
more than we had a right to expect, and her very con ion
looked as if she had been betrayed into the truth. We.
have since found that Catherine, who slept on the lame
door, and whose curiosity prompted her to make observr
tions, confirms this testimony.
`
The next daythe family let forward in two carriigelt

refused Hue continued entreaties of Mr. B. Folger; who at
length drove on, and lell him on foot, having about eighteen
miles to wallr. Mr. Christlield having left the family, re~
tumed with the carriage. and met Matthias on his journey,
vvith whom he conversed some time. And here we discov-
'er a characteristic trait of Matthias; for he repeated his
inquiries about the journey, putting _the question' sereral
times, "Vas there no accident ?" vhich suggested to Mr.
Cliristfieltl the idea, that Matthias wohld have hden pleased
if there lmdbeen. This is
perfectly characteristic ; Mat~
thias' great influence lay in the heartmess of his curses, and
in his adroitness in interpreting natural or accidental events
as the results of his judgments, While Matthias was at
the tavern, he assumed a superior department; and informed
Hr. Christfleld that all was under his (llI'{Cll0tl,'71I')(l that he
would pay his bill. In thc mean time Mr, B. Folger had
`puid the bill; and this being discharged, Mr. Christfield
was not particularly sympathetic with Mattliias' l'('-:t0lUll0l1
to walk. ~
v
On the arrival of the party at Sing-Sing, Matthias' con-
duct became the subject of conversation to the family, then
sitting down to dinner, and Mr. Pierson immediately des~
patched a man with a. horse to meet him. But Mr.'l'homp-
son perceiving no
prospect of great comfort from the divi-
sions in the family, and from Matthias' authoritative, or ra-
ther tyrannicnl manner, at once resolved to leave the house;
and taking leave ofthe party, went ofl, even before Matthias
returned; leaving, however, his with, till he could make
arrangements for her removal. The authoritative manner
of Matthias was, no doubt, u sutliciein reason for his romo~
val, and this he assigned to us; but he had other sufficient
reasons, one tif vhich he gave to Isabella when preparing
for his departure: he observed, "There is too much
chang-
ing ofwives here; I have a nice little woman, and Ishou d
not much like to lose her." Nor was this said without
reason: his little wife was looked at, as a victim of-love or
2 ,
IAIIQTIYI or inputs. )
Zlqgghy theehief members' in the kingdom
had noticed her significantly; Mrs. B. Eo .er lladfihstvuct-
ed her in some of the mysteries; and Matt
`
had atleast
attempted to corrupt her mind; while Mr. Pierson had
some pretensions to her, as he was
partly in despair of ob-
teining the lady for whom he had so
long waited. These
are rather inferences than facts; but they are fair infer-
ences,~when all the circumstances are known and con-
sidered.
Mr. B. Folger had been disappointed in Matthias' daugh-
ter: he was not satisfied with Catherine; and although he
had twice' given up his wife formally, he never lost his ati
fection for her, nor did she lose her influence over him;
he was
consequently in-a constant state of irritation; for
while he professed a belief in Matthias' power, he yet could
not acquicsce in the substitution ofa very plain, unpalished
woman, for his fascinating wife, Events, too, turned the
mind of M-r.,Pierson on the same
subject. He had been
very happy in his marrixxge; nor could hc bc rwonciled to
the death of his wife, till he _was amused with the thought
of again possessing her spirit in the persouofanother: and
when there appearcrl but little hope of possessing his first
object, he become unsettled, and sometimes eventhought
to rival Matthias; and <°veucxp1'ess1:danopinion that he.
ought' to have been the Farther, and that Mrs. B, Folger
ought to have been his;-and in despair of this, urrned his
attention to Mis. Thompson, without, perhaps. in-;' know-
iugpit; for Mr. Pierson was
alwztys 1-xtrvincly modest in
his deportment, and never gave her any oflence, but some-
times paid her little uttvutious. But this subject was dis-
cussed with Matthias, especially with Mr. B. Folger; and
it was
long agitating, whether Mrs. Thompson should be
given up to Mr. Pierson, or to Mr. B. Folger; and this
was only prevented by her timely removal. at her wish,
when she became acquainted with some of these facts. [t is
tme that we should not present this_subject to the public as
facts, on the evidence we possess in relation to any other set
of people, nor should we believe it of other people; but
then is no reason for disbelieving it; in relation to these

'
il
Sui,
Brit is consistent with their 'former and after
uct, and of which we have positive proof; and we venture
to say, could we see Mr. Pierson's diary. it would contain
evidence of what we have now asserted. r'I'his diary has
been denied us, while it has been the subject ofconversa-
tion; and much stranger things have thus been revealed
from that source.
-In addition' to the testimony of lsabellu on
thissuthiect,
ye get at the following lixcts:--Mr. Thompson related to
us the doctrine of Matthias on the subject of tnarriage, and
their effects, as
extremely artful, based on
apparently lofty
morals and high pretensions to superior power and divine
wisdom ;, but, in their progress' calculated to our-rcoxne the
barriers to female purity, which might be abused ut any
time. There is no
proofof Matthias' incontinence to Mrs.
B. Folger, but his opinions might be applied to a commu-
nity offemales, if he had chosen, after the manner of Ma-
homet. /He then mentioned, that Matthias had thus attempt~
ed to overcome the modesty_of his wife; who herself told
ls, that she had objected to any bathing ceremony: but
Matthias, in tnlkingto heron this subject, had reproved her
for her pride, obstinacy, and improptr thoughts; he said
to her, "
You have a little devil about you, which I shall
sometime see§ in spite of your present pride." And this
her husband interprets as
referring to the exposure of her
perm. And yet hethen entertained considerable respect
for Matthias, at least no ill-will; and hoped, in treating on
the account ofthe kingdom, that we should not be too se-
vere on the old man; as he did not think him worse than
others in the kingdom.
Mr. Thompson, it will be observed, went away from Sing-
iing, partly on suspicions of this sort, but left his wife till
he could make arran ements for her departure. Previous
to her hushand's resolution _she had reason to su t some
auch design; but as the approaches were grsduzlteiind the
language douhtfitl. there was an
uncertainty as to the inten-
tion ofthe party. Mrs. Thompson then informed us, that
Mx. B. Folger ,would sometimes walk under the
portico in
bert d' the house with Matthias, and vent his disappoint

mem that 'hs-had given up his wife, and had mibh
match spirit, for he oould not be content with-Ollherine:
and Matthias would comfort him, urge him to and
assure him that God would provide a match spirit for-him;
and on one occasion assured him, that perhaps that very
house contained such a match spirit He frequently re-
peated, that Elizabeth (Mrs. Thompson's name) and Benja-
min were Scripture names, and indicated a likeness of spi-
rit. And these conversations, part of which were
frequently
heard, she understood as referring to her. And after her
husband's departure, the doors were locked and bolted, at
perfect variance with Matthias' former doctrines, which de-
spised locks and bolts; and, in explanation, Matthias ob-
served, "
If I have a tender lamb, and I see a wolf coming
to take it," shall I not take care of her fl" This, too, Mrs.
Thompson understood as
referring to her; but the bolts
might also have reference to his unpopularity in Sing-Sing.
Matthias also distinctly told her, that her husband was. not
her match spirit. Now this lady may have been mistaken
in some of her conclusions, butshe could not be in others.
On' her husband's return, she immediately acquainted him
with har suspicions, and he removed her as soon as pos-
sible. V
~
Our explanation of this strange affair is this, Matthias
had taken Mrs. B. Folger, at her will, for his own pleasure.
To justify this he was
obliged to enforce and enlarge upon
his former doctrines, ofthe marriage ofdevils, match spirits,
His doctrine of heaven upon earth led to personal en-
joryments, which, in the weak and perverted minds of some
o the establishment, led to voluptuousness, as
yielding the
greatestenjoyment, and hence a
gross sensuality pervaded

WHILE the events which we have been relating were in

which we have not mentioned. because they were princi-
pally unconnected vvith the events ve have related; and
their introduction would have spoiled the unity of those
transactions which bore upon each other. Ve must now,
however, introduce another person, and with him the his-
tory of his connexion with Matthias, Mr. Pierson, and Mr.
B. Folger.
'
-
In pages 247, 8, 9, of Mr. Stone's book we find the fol-
lowing:
"There is no doubt of the fact, _that there were n set of
thoroughfbred knaves hanging about the skirts ot" Pierson
and Folger, more
especially the former; 11 knot of harpies,
wjho, availing themselves of the delusion by which those
gentlemen were blinded, sported with their credulity, under
pretext of joining the association, but in reality to plunder
them of their property. Such an
impression has long been
entertained by those conversant with their pecuniary con-
cemi; and when circumstances previously known are com~
med
with some ofthe privatepbut im rfect memoranda
by Mr. Pierson, the proof is as c ear as could be de-
'I~

Q
, there was indeed a combinationof sv
them, though the evidence is not exactly suchtziz
can
bring,
home the facts, in a
legal form,'to a court and
jury. T e loose papers, just referred to, contain various
entries of moneys advanced, or rather given, to these people.
To one individual, on a certain occasion, he gave the sum
of one thousand dollars, by direction, as he supposed, ofthe
Holy Spirit, and with a
promise, from the same source,
that he should receive threefold in return. Pierson and
Folger were likewise inveigled into various unfortunate
speculations in patented inventions, by which many sums
of money were lost. What some of these unlucky adven-
tures were, the reader will discover by the following ;~:'nyer,
taken from the papers of the former :- _
_
" '
Nov. 12th, 1833. Spirit of Truth! guide us into the
right way concerning the globe stove, seltiloading cart, and
planing machine. Manifest thy' mind concerning these
things, that we

" '
I ask that the evil spirits may have no
power to hinder
the successful and beneficial operation of these things.

"They likewise embarked, to a consi erable extent, in
speculations of real estate-always under the direction of
the Holy Spirit-Mr. Pierson having the vision, and Mr.
Folgercmaking the purchases and sales. These were not
all unsuccessful, but no very great profits were realized.
And even had there been, the avails would have been swal-
lowed up in the stock operations which Mr. Pierson sup:
posed he was making bythe same Divine direction. The
following is a
copy of one of his spiritual missives, to Mn
Folger, to purchase stock :-
"
*Jane 3, 1833. W'rote to B. H. Folger: Now is the
accepted time; buy three hundred shares. Let it be left
with thee to sell, and I will direct. More than ten will be

siders himselfhs one of the persons alluded to in the above
paragraph; `and alluded to in such a manner, that while
it serves as an accusation, understood by him and his friends,
he is not named or mentioned in an way which makes the
author _of the allusion responsible. 'lihis is cowardly, inean,
a' stab in the dark. It was this trait in Mr. Stone's book
which first arrested our attention, and determined us to re-
ply to it, could we get at the facts. And what dependance
is to be placed on such allusions ma '
be judged by the ia-
Iitmous attack on the Mrs. ""', and the exposure which we
gave of that in the first part.
`

_We are not about to deny allegations made in relation td
persons whom we have not seen or known, and concerning
which we have never examined. Some allusions may re
fer to facts, which could be established; but then, we think.
these facts ought to be stated, in relation to such individuals,
leaving the public to draw such conclusions as the facts jus-
tify. Instead of which, we find the basest charges brought
in the meanest manner; and in the cases ve have examined,
these charges have been vicious, or designing.
We have seen Mr. Hunt; he has put into our hands pa-
pers prepared for a court of law; he has given us
every
information ve
sought, and candidly answered every ques-
tion, and explained every matter apparently doubtful, and
challenges even
public exposure, without reserve: and as
we have followed up his references, through the most re-
spectable sources, we
get at what ve believe the truth.
Though Mr. Pierson had left business, and was
very de-
sirous of becoming a ministerof religion, and, as such, was
a close student, especially of his Bible; and although he
was
successively engaged with various institutions, and
particularly
the Magdalene scheme. which he first estab-
ished, and to whom it was
finally given up, after the pub-
lic testimony and the publication of the celebrated report.
Although he was thus busy in collecting inmates for that
institution,_managing it, and forming a church, and after-
ward so
closely engaged with Matthias, he was, neverthe-
less, eng~aged,1n speculations, and had a particular inclina»
tion for machinery and patent-rights. With this object in
NAlllA'l'lYE'0l` rs.xnsi.r.A. f
I
_itwhe obtained an interview with Mr] Hunt, (mentioned
abovegzmin
1832, through a
disciple of Mr, Pierson, whose
name s notiappeared, because he was not connected with
,Matthiasg and by Mr.'Pierson Mr. Hunt was introduced to
_Mn B. I-I. Folger. Soon alter the first introduction, Mr.
Pierson informed that gentleman that he had considerable
sums of money at command, which he would like to invei
in machinery and patents; and wished Mr. Hunt, whom
he regarded as a mechanical genius, to direct him in the
disposal of his money, and urged him to commence some
operations. This gentleman, aware of' the uncertainty of
mechanical operations, dissuaded him from this purpose,
and advised a
speculation in lots in the upper wards. With
much difficulty Mr. Hunt succeeded, and introduced Mr.
Hiram Parker to Mr. Pierson, a
respectable land agent in
the 6th and 3d Ayenues. We happened to he known to
Mr.`Hui1t, and we knew Mr. Parker; the former sought
us out, and we sought out the latter: and thus we have
seen both the gentlemen separately, and obtained from them
a correct account.
`
It appears that speculations in land, to the amount of
filtythousand dollars, were entered into by these gentlemen.
The land was bought principally by Mr. Parker, assisted
by Mr. Hunt. These
purchases were made in the name
of B. H. Folger, but chiefly with Mr. Pierson's money, as
Mr. Parker supposes. The fact is, that Mr. Pierson would
not suffer his name to be used in any wa connected with
either manuiactories or
speculations; but lie was
regularly
consulted, and appeared the principal in the transactions
We believe his reason for not putting his name-to these
secular transactions was, that he wished, as before express-
ed, to be a minister, and supposed these business and spec-
ulating concerns would injure his claims to the ministry,
Mr. Parker and Mr. Hunt were to have a small share of
the profits, if any, for their agency, but supplied no
capital.
Matthias, it appears, objected to the appropriation o this
money in the purchase of land-he called it buying his
mother-and he had then much influence over Mr. Pier
ion. Matthias preached that the whole earth was theirs,

those lots were-finally resold, and the accoumstdblek
prof# of about eight thousand. We have this from H .
Parker, who very candidly gave us every info.rmatiou;¢l
not knowing that wc knew Mr. Hunt, referred to him for
further information : and thus we-obtained a C0!I'0b0l'GFhl
of Mr. I-lunt's statements. s
.Mr. Parker is now in occasional intercourse with Mr.
B. H. Folger; of him he remarks, that, as far as the trans
actions with him, on which he lays emphasis, he has been
always honourable: he also considers Mrf Pierson and Mr.
Hunt, particularly, honourable in all their transactions.
On inquiry, we found that the money actually paidrcblh
on the various purchases was a
very considerable propos'
tion of the whole; in some cases hail] but in many two
thirds. Mr. Pierson, however, was not satisfied with these
speculations; and, even before they were closed, urged Mr.
Hunt to commence the manufacture of his globe stoves, in
partnership, desiring also to buy the patent-right A1 his
entreaty .Mr. Hunt commenced a manufacture, in partner-
ship with Mr. Pierson, and afterward with Mr. H.
Folie;
I-Ierc again Mr. Pierson and Mr. B. H. Folger were to
capital. Mr. Hunt was to take up what money he wanted
for the manufactory, and monthlysettlcments were to he
made. But Mr. Pierson, from the motive héfore noticed,
would not suffer. his name to appear; and therefore lu#
Mr. Hunt the money, from time to time, taking hisaolmnvr-
ledgments regularly for so much mono lest. The factis,

inowledgments, but it afterward proved a
very serious
evil. Mr. Hunt was engaged in this factory when Matthias
was in Clarkson-street: and when Mr. Pierson, for a'time,
banished him, perhaps merely because he stood inhis way
of preaching, (in which Mr. Pierson was
very l'ond,) asno
quarrel appears to have happened; he then permitted Mr.
Hunt to give him small supplies, from to time, but stopped
his regular allowance.
`
Here ve
may notice, and we learned it both from Mr.
Parker and Mr. Hunt, that Matthias recovered his influence
in a vt-rv chxiracteristic vav. Mr. Pierson-was taken ill,`
which al'terward terminated in his being subject tofitsé-
While siclc, he sent ibr Matthias 3 to which Matthias, though
then on
very short and precarious allowance, and much
distressed, haughtily 3l"tS\`L'l't¥L`l, there was no
necessity for
his coming; that if he, Pierson, h'ad faith in hirn, he would
get better; if not, he' would die. Mr. Pierson had* faith,
Qld did get better. Matthias then returned in triumph, and
referred to his sickness as a
judgment on his late conduct;
ind his recovery as the effect of his power.

Matthias ruled in his house. But Matthias infoftned
usthat he had not the charge of the accounts, or
the man-
llgtelnent ol' the large sums, such as were required kr* -the
tframnwtions we have recently referred to. He said,-'that-at

itssvcrsgevalue. And as as
not all made when the stove was begun, customers were
}~iformed that they ~might 'return their purchased stoves at
~l|y future period, to have the improvements added.
i
The
~
consequence was, that they had their shop full ofold stove;
_-some of which were not fit to receive any alteration. This
'
was, 'in iiact, an illustration of the old proverb about °'
too
many cooks," &,c. But the greatest cause of loss- arose
-from Mr. Pierson taking a' foundry at Waterford above
.
Hudson, on the North river,`,while Mr. Hunt and the factory
were in Greenwich. The inconvenience of this was-pointed'
out by Mr. Hunt, but overruled by his partners. The con
-sequence was, an enormous loss, as no errors could be
remedied at that distance, and bad castings accumu-
"ul:
`
'e ; which, at last, was remedied by Mr. I-Iunt's presence;
i$nsaarrying, in part, the factorytothe foundry. ~
A per-
,$on,_too, named Doyle, employed when Mr. Hunt was ill
E-and absent, tried experiments, lost considerable, and then
.vetnlrned to the old methods. We can
easily conceive, as
fthere was no .want of capital at first, and as the- stove was
ibegun before the plans were
completed, urged on
-Pierson, and as their sale was
impeded by an overc rge,
'and as there would be orders and counter orders, with equal
ipoiver, and different opinions-we can
easily conceive of the
/twang-of success in the first instance, and of its final success,
-now they have profited

_
.skier a
lapseof time, r some reason, which Mr. Hunt
does ,not suppose was the want of money, the monthly set-
:qersems were not made by Mr. Pierson and Mr. B. I-I. Fol-
fer; and the supplies were

FQQIH,occur by stopping the manufactory, he was induced

ruraanrvn or tannn.
i
tovmiso funds elsewhere, from week to week, expecting#-
settlement, according to the terms. We think it likely that
Mr. Folger began to feel a
deficiency of money, as he sin-=
ward became embarrassed, and therefore cut off the supply-1
from this unprofitable business, and deferred a settle e&'
from' neeessit . But in the midst of this a curious event
occurred, hi lily characteristic, which marks the folly ur-
madness of the pany. _
~
Mr. Pierson, it appears, had ,intended the profits of this
globe stove manufactory to be applied to the building of ar
magnificent temple, suitable to the future splendour of the
kingdom; that is; what it was
going to be: but although-
this concern was rather a loss than a profit, this object was
seriously proposed; and Mr. Hunt conceives, that their not
settling with him was possibly connected with a desire rn'
command his services in this scheme, as
they had great
faith in his knowledge as a mechanic ; at least thus mach-,
is true.
Mr. Pierson had now removed to Sing-Sing, in 1834;
and by what took place on the subiect we are about to þÿrela ¬e,;_
it was after the period of Mrs. B. H. Folger's union with-
Matthias, when one
day Mr. Hunt received a pressing iu~
titation to come to Mount Zion, Sing-Sing. He had some
idea ofthe subject from previous hints. 'I`his subject he
would gladly have cvaded; but as he wanted a settlement,
he thought he might promote that object by going; and be
therefore went, and was met at the landing-place by Mat~
thins and the carriage, in which he was driven to the house,
Mount Zion. On entering which, and addressing Mrs. B.,
H. Folger as such, Matthias corrected Mr. Hunt, -and in-
formed him that that ladywas not called Mrs. Folger, bhr
Mother. This was acquiesccd in by Mr. Hunt, who on!
wanted a settlement, He then had a
private interview wit;
Mr. Pierson and Matthias; when the latter, assuming ar
smiling countenance, ex ressive also of doubt, as if what
he was about to say woul)d be received as foll , remarkel
to Mr. Pierson, "Shall I?" to which the otliver gave hi
assent. When Matthias, resuming his gravity. beganb-
ltate to Mr. Hunt, that they, Pierson and Matthiu. hadnt,

!ll&ofSolomon's. Mr. Hunt received the proposition with
due gravity; as he wanted a settlement and not to offend
them. And aiier receiving various compliments u n his
mechanical genius, and pressing inritations to join thi;king-
dom, he begged to take time to consider the proposition,
and then hinted at the settletnentpbut Mr. Pierson was
now
wholly engrossed on this temple building, and could
attend to nothing else: he left, therefore, without effecting
any thing for himself or them. _
Now this temple scheme supposes an extra degree of
madness, il' the parties were really so short of money. As
the scheme was one of Matthias, in which Mr. Pierson
entered with all his soul, Mr. B. H. Folger must also have
been privy to it, as one in the kingdom. lt was calculated,
howe er, to have a curious effect on Mr, Hunt; he could
not conceive that there could be u
deficiency of money for
his settlement, or for carrying on the factory; and as such,
it was well adapted to mal-;e him submit to the clelny he
experienced in getting I1 settlement, however singular he
might think it. The Erctory, therefore, went on as well as
he could make it, with pnrtiztl supplies und all ilu- difficul-
ties stated; and at
every opportunity seeking a st-uleinent,
Sometimes from Mr. B. H. Folger, and then from Mr. Pier-
son, and by both put off: indeed, the longer it ran the more
difficult a settlement became, and nc'-v reasons could be
given for deferring it. _
_, WVe are now
approaching the period we left ollat in tho
last chapter; and as
Mr, Hunt had something to do with
the next singular transaction in the kingdom, we chose to
introduce him, as we have done, in connexion with the prop-
erty of, Mr. Pierson and Mr. B. H. Folger. We shall
now,.therel`ore, resume the proceedings which properly be¢
longi to the kingdom, or which arose out of the religious
d trips: of Matthiasor, Mr, Pierson; and these _might be
e;:ll¢d. in distinction to the secular trsnssctions,

Mr B Folger's discontent was not remedied b thede
parture of Mrs. Thompson,
'whose
account closed(the last'
chapten) oi' the recent forma , second delitjery of his,wife-
into the arms of Matthias: his dissatisfaction evidqitly in-
creased; and if he had not' resolution, or strength of mind,
to renounce the faith of Matthias, and take his yvife, to whom
he was
yet attached, yet he had frequently courage to gov
halfway, and deny her to Matthias. 'l'he barrier which
he met was in his wifc's affection for this latter, and the
contempt in which she apparently held his physical powers;
In this case a son of middle course was observed : hc,
B. Folger, denied by his wife, denied her to Matthias, as
he had the legal right: she, so situated, slept, when. in.
Sing-Sing, in the north wing; but, as
may easily be srp~
posed, she left her chamber frequently in the night, or morn-
ing, for Matthias' room; believing him to be her proper
spouse, or matched spirit. The discontent of Mr. .B. Folger
continuing, he not only gave vent to it within the kingdoni
but complained also to his friends, of the intrusion of Mar
thias, Without explaining his exact _situation ; and these-
generally supposed that Matthias had obtained that sort
of influence over Mr. B. H. Folger which clergyman often
obtain over females. But it was not then generally sup-
posed that he had given up his wife. Besides, he was u~
cillating-one day a sincere believer in Matthias, and ano-
ther. did not scruple to suspect him an impostor. Perhapg
as Voltaire says of courage, it depended a good deal on his
hysical state, and he believed or disbelieved according as
liis passions or desires prevailed or subsided. His friends;
about this time, took a
good deal of interest in his case, null'
advised him to get rid_of"Mntt|iias. V
On Sunday, Junei lst, Mr. Stone relates, (page l89 of his
book, that Mr. B. Folger remained in New York, much
agitated about Matthias' doctrines, (we think it would be
nearer truth if he said, his wife,) that he attended the Rex.;
Mr, Duboise, in Franklin-street, and sat in his mother-in-
law's pew' and was there so much affected that he wepla

Then follows a
description ofwhat took place at Sing-Sing,
and the consequences: but as his account is extremely gar-
bled, had as proceeding from the pen of Mr. or Mrs. Fol~
ger, actdrs in the scenes, and consequently interested, we
shall prefer giving our own narrative, .which we have ob-
tained 'from Isabella, corroborated, in various parts, by
others.
The oing to church part is, we believe, correct; and it
is equalfy correct that, at this time, Mr. B. Folger's discon-
tent, assisted by the advice of friends, had worked him up
tothe purpose stated in Mr. Stone's book: but the person
who chiefly influenced him at this time was Mr. Hunt, his
partner in the globe stove manufacture, whom we have just
introduced; and who walked about Greenwich with him,
for about four hours, urging him to this step, and at last
obtained his consent. It was to
this gentleman, and at this
time, that Mr. B. Folger made the exclamation, "
If Mat-
thias is not true, Iama ruined man!" This gentleman
prevailed _with Mr. B. Folger, and he determined to remove
his family from Sing-Sing. Mr. B. Folger mentioned his
purpose
to Mr. VVhiting, in Canal-street, and also, we be~
ieve, to others in New York: and when he got down to
Sing-Sing, he mentioned his pur se to several ofhis friends
there, and fortified himself for tiig encoimter by some pota-
tions of liquor. These friends all encouraged him in his
object, and offered their assistance.
,Being thus determined, he proceeded to his house; and
meeting his wife in the ent , the following is part of the
scene which occurred, on ll'/iiinday, June 2d, 1834:-

towards the poker, exclaims)

(The poker was removed, and Mr. B. Folger rushes from
point to point, to seize some offensive weapon-all the king-
dom resent, and in confusion, each removing every kind
of odgnsive instrument. The knives were thrown, partly
into the cellar and partly into the garden, and other instru~
ments were scattered about; and some of the knives lay
three weeks in the garden. Mr. B. Folger at length ob-
tained a broom, and menaced Matthias, who still kept in
frog of Mrs. Folger ;_or, rather, she kept behind him. The

wrested from Mr. Folger; and then, summoning

latthias swung his sword about, and with charleterilic
solemnity, thus exclaimed,)
Matthias. "
[At that spirit be destroyed!" (Still swing-
ing the sword and
repeating the words.) The spirit, how-
ever, did not obe him just then; and Mr. Pierson inter-
fered, with a mild'and slow speech. .
Pkrsm "
Now, Benjamin, let me have a
private iuter~
view with ou."
Mr. B. Folger. "
Pierson, when you told me that the
Lord told you, not to let Matthias have any more monev,
that was a true spirit: Why don't you stick to that 2" (Mr.
B. Folger's strength was now
expended, but not his pas-
sion, and he still determined upon his purpose; and for
that end said to his wife)
"
Fix yourself to go with me."
Mrs. B. Folger.
"
Benjamin, I will not."
Much more occurred, in the same spirit; but Mr. B.
Folger still insisted on his wife's leaving; and telling her
he was
going to get a
wagon and a carriage, desired her
again to fix herselli and left the house, still in his passion;
to go up to Sing-Sing, for the purpose mentioned: and here,
it appears, he repeated his grievances to several friends.-
He procured a wagon, and directed the landlord to f`or~
ward a coach to fetch his family.
In Mr. B. Folger's absence, Matthias and Mrs. B. Folger
sat in each other's arms on the sofa, lamenting the events or
that day, a'nd devising the best means of defence; while
Isabella forwarded dinner, and the rest of the family con-
tributed to the restoration of order. But curiosity prompted
Isabella occasionally to observe the conduct of the princi-
pals in the kingdom. s And when Mr. B. Folger returned,
which he soon did, with the wagon, Mrs. B. Folger re-
tired to one end, ofthe sofa, leaving Matthias in the middle:
inthe mean time dinner was prepared. On the entry of
Mr. B. Folger he was more calm, but apparently deter-
mined; and he took a chair near them, and the dialogue
recommenced.

persuasion and evasions, tlive thmilyaat
down to dinner, and soon after Mr. B. Fol .er joined the.
table: in fact, he was evidently foiled, and his resolution,
perhaps, began to waver; and after dinner he submitted to
discussion. But this uarrel closed in a characteristic way.
Mrs. B. Folger led odMr. B. Folger into the north wing,
calmly to discuss the matter, and arrange affairs privately.
This was the chamber into which she and Matthias had
retired when 'she first announced her hushand's c<'~:>f>nt to
their union, as match spirits. It was used, it will be recoi-
lected, as the bathing-room, and as the children's bedroom;
in this room, too, Mrs. Folger sometimes slept. W'hat were;
the arguments used on this occasion, or what were the
means of persuasion, (for the interview was
strictly private)
we know not: they must, however, have been extremely
soothing; and if not gratifying, at least satisfying to Mr. B.
Folger, for he came out like a tamed elephant, with all his
passions subdued; affording the strongest proof of his irre-
solution, and of her iniiuence over him. Vl`hether this
magic spell was the effect of favours granted, and promises
made, or of religious instruction, we know. not, but he now
professed to have been in the wrong. He renewed his
faith in Matthias; and, conscious that he had raised a storm
in the village, which might not be easily laid, he desired to
go into Sing-Sing, and quiet, if ossible, the feelings he had
excited against Matthias. He than dismissed the carriages,
and went immediately on this new mission. And now,
after many hours' ferment, there was a calm in the king-
dom; but of short duration, for other troubles, anticipated
indeed, were just at the threshold.
On Mr. B; Folger's arrival at the village, he .observed
hisvassembled friends, who were waiting to hear, that he
had either turned out Matthias, or that he had brought
away his family; but when Mr. B. Folger informed them,.

tht he lust have been mistalren,and thathe thenbelieved
Matthias a
good man and true rophet, the could not sup-'
press their astonishment: and' however he might have
changed his opinions, his friends retained theirs, and avow~
ed their determination to
expel Matthias from _the village,
with or without Mr. Folgers consent. When, therefore,
Mr. Folger retumed, he was followed by some ofthe people.
And soon alter he entered his. house, several of his friends
came to offer their services and ive advice. Mr. Folger
begged them to retire, declared he had no com laint, that
he must have been deceived, and urged them, as hisfriends,
to' leave him alone. Still the people increased in numbers;
and if night had not kindly come to their relief the mob
would possibly have proceeded to some violence, as it was
with much reluctance they retired. Matthias slept that
night with Mrs. B. Folger; but, in her nightdress, leaving
Matthias in bed, she visited her husband in his chamber, in
the rnoming.
'
On that morning the sun, arose as usual, and so did the
pneplple; and a few ominous stragglers, and impertinentboys,
e their appearance about the house. Mr. B. Folger,
who knew the irritated state of the public feeling, again
proposed going into the village to attempt to alla '
it, and
set off for that purpose. But on
entering the viilage, he
found so high an excitement against Matthias, that though
he proclaimed, as before, that he was mistaken in his tor-
mer
ageusations, yet he had no
hopes of alla ing the strong
feelings against Matthias. And doubting the safety of the
prophet, he procured a coach, with the intention of advising
the Father to retire from what evidentl appeared an
ap-
goaching
storm. The carriage, therefiire, was driven to
ion Hill, and Matthias acquainted with the state of things,
who himself thought it prudent to retire; and in much sor-
row, especially to Mrs. B, Folger, the members of the king-
dom began to prepare his baggage. But by this time (now
about noon) the crowd had increased. The hill which over-
looked the house was
capped
with spectators, expecting
some movement; the roa and lane leadingto the house
was
crowdsd;_the fences invaded, and the trees climbed

he drove up to Zion Hill; and assuming to ba a constable,
and pretending to have a writ, he demanded that 'Matthias
should be surrendered to him: but intimated, that it'woul.d
be extremely dangerous for him to go to Sing-Sing, and
'through such an .enraged crowd, vith his beard on, and
advised him to have it cnt off or let him cut it ollf Mat-
thias believed he had a writ, and took ten minutes to con-
sider his advice; at the expiration of which he wisely de~
termined to sacrifice his beard, for the preservation of his
head or body, and himself began to cut it off; but not ma-
king much progress, he sought the assistance of Mrs. B.
Folger, and these two, with much mutual condolence, eli
fected this ob'ect; while Catherine received the locks in
her apron, and Mr. Pierson kept Elephant Taylor in conf
versation. Isabella seeing the beard ofll hurried Catherine
into the kitchen, and, without instruction or advice, rolled
-up the precious relic, and stuffed it under the kitchen car-
pet,
as a
prize, which she suspected Mrs. B. Folger would
ike to retain.
Thus altered in his a
pearance, Matthias entered' the car-
riage, and with him hir. Pierson and Mr. B. Folger, as
part ofthe kingdom, and thus set off for the village, Ele-
phant Taylor bringing up the rear in his old wagon The
people were ignorant ofthis measure, and were
consequently
confounded, especially as Pierson wore a beard. Some fo -
lowed the carriage, some staid behind, some said Matthias
was in it, and others that he was not: buta universal shout
oftriumph, as the carriage drew off] and the crowd followed,
agonized the delicate frame of Mrs. B. Folger. When she
entered the house she directed the windows "to be closed-

equally confounded, as Elephant had not made his engage-
ment very public: he succeeded, however, in showing Qt-
thias without his beard; and then, assuming an excuse, bold
himthere was some mistake about it, and allowed him toth-
part. But the people now began to understand it, andaguin
to rally; and having got him out of the house, they seemed'
determined not to suffer him again to enter. On his-
thereibre, to Zion Hill, before the body of the pelqio
up, he did not get out ofthe carriage, or even

ger running half across the lawn, in the presencenf tie

her hands, apparently much agonized, as the carriagedrevlv

"
.
Late in the altemoon, after Matthias had gone to New
York, and while Mr. Pierson and Mr. B. Folger weretin
the garden, back came Elephant Taylor, making a request,
.or rather a demand, for Matthias' beard. ~
But as the trick
was now understood in the kingdom, he wasweceived with
a show of violence, and obliged to make his retreat inqmidlt
time; for Mr. Pierson and Mr. B. Folger .seized upon some
poles, then inthe ground, and put themselves in fighting
attitude. Violence, we believe, was
prevented only by-his
timely retreat.
It appears that Elephant had engaged to cut ofiftheheavd
Airway; and bring it to Sing-Sing, and in this .he had fail-
ed; and committed himself by saying. that he /aadcutdl'
the beard, but forgot it. ,
Had we not known of'this~hlm-
,hood we should have endeavoured tovsee :this permnmt
Sing-Sing; but this fact would render an additional evi-
dence, on his part, doubtful. We believe, liowever, he got
his reward; and he has since been made constable, perhaps
for this feat of humour, on his side successfully executed.
As the evening closed in, Mrs. B. Folger became more

calm, and Mr. B. Folger betrayed great uneasiness and
anxiet to get to bed; exclaiming to his Wife,-"Cotne,
Ann, l'et's go to bed! I've had a
great deal of trouble to
get you." _And that night Mr. B. Folger slept withj his
421 `wife; Tuesday, June Bd, 1834.

After the departure of Matthias, Mr. Pierson affected the
character of the Father. At the supper and breakfast' table
he took his place, adopted Matthias' style of speaking, and
spoke ofthe late events as ofthe will of God, and plainly
intiimated, that if it were the will of God to remove Matthias,
'dllfmé Same
spiritrwould be in him, and that he should
158 thb Father. Mr. Pierson had before even intimated to
_
3. Folger, that he ought to have been the Father, and
if 'Ss enola- to have had her as the Mother. And Matthias
dtjiqelitold us, on the occasion before mentioned, after his
'
_.v
imprispnment, in answer to our queries relative to the re-
jl2i'¢bd'quarrel between him and Mr. Pierson, that there
'
§'as't10 quarrel; but that Mr. Pierson thought he ought to
"gg-bggthe Father, and having the means in his power, assumed,
in a.periocl, that character. 'l'o make this intelligible, we
'
thigshexplain what Matthias meant by "assuming to be the
'
'F8ther:' and this is the explanation he gave us.
'Matthias held that he had the Spirit of God given to him,
'
anhé fittest person to govern the kingdom; and inthat sense
_ Jie was the Father, the head: and with much modesty he
assured us, that if a more Ht person should arise up among
them, to be the Father, he should resign his pretensions.
In the same spirit, when the kingdom was once assembled,
he inquired,
"
Now who do you think the most proper per-
son to be the Mother 2" when, one
by one, beginning with
Mr. Pierson, each declared, that Mrs. Folger was the most
`suitable; while she, with becioming modesty, held down
her face, and that face on her hand. This, however, took
lace alter Matthias had declared her the Mother, and taken
get as such to his bed.
"
`
_ML Pierson then, it appears, at times, did not heartily
acqniesce in the assumption of Matthias. He did think.
sometimes, that he ought to have been the Father; and at
all events, he held himself as successor, in cue of God; in

annsiderable impression on the stem virtue o Mr. Pierson.
New Mn -Pierson was a man who thought and wrote much
.-more than he spoke; he was not a
talking man, and _he
evidently could restrain his feelings. When, theretbre, Mr.
Pierson says a little on a
subject, and when he showed a lit-
deattention to.Mrs. B. Folger, we believe there were
very
:Hong impressions made on him; and we believe that his
flliary, or
journal, would contain strong evidences of his
wish to become the Father, and to take Mrs. B. Folger as
(ire ,Mother, as a substitute for the lady in whom he was
disappointed. We. feel it our
duty, however, to declare,
that we 1-know of no evidence of any improper freedoms'
ever existing between Mr. Pierson and Mrs. Folger;_;or
she, who must have known the influence she had over him,
always expressed dislike; and, on this very occasion, de-
-clared., "
she could not bear to see Mr. Pierson sit in Fa-
-.»ther's place, and pretend to be the Father."
'The effects of a corrupted moral atmosphere, which Mr.
Pierson had partly created, on the honest and ure mind of
himself, is a
very singular case; and we mucli regret that
we cannot lay open his diary, as
proofs of our conclusions,
and
.'for_ the ,benefit which might be derived, by showing,the
pine :the motives may have been.
Mr. Pierson's assumption ofthe Father was, however, of
short duration; for Matthias was not permitted to languish

ofthe events we have been relating, but;

thqJ}i_vvere noticed, there was no intention of making them

P In consequence of the connexion between Matthias an!
Mrs. B. Folger, this lady became with child, us she had
expected and foretold, agreeable to certain visions and im--
pressions, which she supposed to be from God, and in.~
which Matthias acquiesced. The expected offspring, sbp
supposed,
would be a
holy son; and Matthias, with more
bo ness than cunning, taught her to believe that she wouli
bear this child, as
holy, without sickness, and bring it forth
Without pain. But, as
early as the preceding March, 1834;
the sickness, which usuall follows conception, came on her,
and she manifested all the symptoms of other women in
such a situation. Now it will be recollected that Mrs. Fol-
§pr stated, in her narrative, in Stone's book, an example of
atthias' cruelty, in taking a
pillow, or little quilt, from
her, which she had rolled up and placed on a chair when
sick, to give her ease. This then occurred on the occasion
we are
speaking ot: in her, or Matthias' room. We have;-»
quoted the passage in full, in the first part of this work: see
pages 57 and 58, part the first. Matthias did pull the quilt
from the chair, exclaiming, "This will never do! '1'his is.
the old story," in reference to sickness in child-bearing+
shaking his head, putting out his lips, and assuming a su-
periority: for she had supposed that she should have not
sickness, and`he had encouraged the idea, and now wishei
to overcome the feelings of the body by the excitement of
the mind; either sincerely, in faith, or cunningly, upon phi-
losophical princi les; and could he have enabled her tm
surmount her feelings, he would have obtained a trium IL
The account in Mr. Stone's book, (page l53,) avow
written by Mr. and Mrs. Folger, is calculated to deceive..
and conceal the fact we have just stated. _

advanced asfar as the summer of 1834: but, as far hack
,asthe winter of' 1833, Mr. B. Folger had become insolvent,
soon after he had given up his wife, and at the very time
_he was engaged for or with Matthias' daughter. Previous
to this, however, he had made over the house at Sing-Sing,
and considerable property, to Matthias, at the instigation of
his wife. This Mr. B. Folger would frequently remark, in
pleasantry, that she (Mrs. B. Folger) had
pdayed
the Jew;
in tirst getting the property made over to im, (Matthias)
and then taking him hersellf Mr. Folger's insolvency
did not appear to be
generally known; for Mr. Hunt, at
that time, did not seem to un erstand it so:
perhaps the
magnificent ideas of Mr. Pierson, about the twelve temples,
as we before supposed, might have misled him. About this
time, however, the property vas taken away from Matthias
and made over to Pierson, as being more' secure. Isabella
pieard, 'at that time, a good deal about bankruptcy; but from
her previous habits, in a farm, and in the Methodistchurch,
she did not even know then what it meant, but supposed it
referred to property in a bank. She was, however, inform-
ed, ,by_Mrs. Folger, that this transfer was to make the pro-
perty more secure, as
it might be taken from Mr. Folger,
as Mr. Mills' property was taken from him. Mr. Pierson,
however, afterward made the same
property, and other,
over to Matthias' again, at Mrs. B. Folger's entreaty: but
which property has since been recovered by the executors
of Mr. Pierson for his daughter, some of which was never
legally-transferred- We leam from Mr. Pierson's sisters,
and the former owner of the property 'in Third-street, that
Mr. B. Folger claimed that property, in exchange for the
house at Sing-Sing; and that much of Mrs. B. Folger's for-
tune of 6,0006,000isnlowlentonmortgageonthatproperty. is nlow lent on mortgage on that property.
We should certainly feel a
great delicacy in going into the
account of
property, were it not for some mysterious facts
connected with Mr. Pierson's estate, and the foolish but
characteristic ,attack on others, in Mr. Stone's book.
Mr. Hunt, partly in ignorance of Mr. Folger's circum~
stances, still continued to press for pa settlement; and when,
at a. later period, he became convinced of Mr. Folger's in-
'
.uxunuwvl on muses. , GU-
nlvasrmyx.
hetoffeounso became more anxious for an#
arrange-
ment: e was, however, assured by Mr. B; Folger, that
his insolvenc should notadiiect him. After various delays,
some of whicli appeared trifling, and others cruel, as an
appointment at a time of Mr. Hunt's known sickness, when
it- was
irnpo ible for him to attend ;-after ever excuse
made, both by Mr. Pierson and Mr. B. Folger, had bees:
exhausted, he at last obtained a
meeting, and a
positive pree-
position, but one ofthe strangest-that ever one business mam
put to another; which was no less than that he, Mr. Hum;
must.
apply
to- Matthias, and that, whatever he (Matthias)
said. shou d be done. Now Mr. Hunt held Matthiasin
contempt, especially as a business man. Mr. Hunt had, ire-
deed, treated him kindly, but as a weak-minded manic;
who might be sincere, but, if sincere, then a foolish man.
Matthias,
apparently,
knew Mr. Hunt -held him in this es-
tehose of the kingdom, and therefore he remonstrated against
such a decision, from the incapacity of Matthias, independ-
ently of his will. But as this was resolved on, and as Mr.
Hunt wished to remove every excuse for a settlement, .he
consented to go to the Prophet. At this interview Matthias
claimed all the
property, spoke in
_mysterious language;
gave no satisfaction, an
finally, positively refused to come
to any settlement: and as this decision was considerei
final, on the part of Mr. Pierson and Mr. B. Folger, Mr.
Hunt now had_recourse to a suit in Chancery; which was
begun to compel a settlement, without any angry feelings;
and the papers prepared for this suit have been put intocllr
lands. When, however, the suit was commenced, Mr.
Pierson and Mr. Folger came to Mr. Hunt, with various
propositions for closing the old and making new engagv
ments, and requesting from him propositions. At length
a
proposition was made on the part of Mr. Pierson and»Mr._
B. Folger, which Mr. Hunt chose to accept, rather th#
leavethe aifair unsettled, and all his acknowledgments i
the hands of Mr. Pierson. The substance of this arrange
ment was, that Mr. »Hunt should receive back all his U:-
knowledgments, which gave him so much uneasiness, and
60
1
témation, an did not generally presume, as he did with'
66 iuaunvn or rsnaau.
i
thathis claims for salary should be allowed for the time
he had been engaged, that he should beliberated from all
demands on the concern, and receive something less than
a thousand dollars clear. And that he should give up his
share in the globe stove mannfactory, with the tent-right;
also his right in the globe castors, coach bellfscrew ma-
chine, his profits on the land speculation, and his good will
on a lease of property in Amos-street, then
occplpied
as a
factory. And these terms were
finally compli with, as
far as he vas concerned. But Mr. Hunt et complains,
that Mr. B. Folger has not settled some small debts, on the
part of the concern, which he' (Mr. Hunt) had promised,
and on whom a moral claim yet exists, extremely unpleas-
ant, as he relied on the word, andconsequently the honour,
of.Mr. B. Folger. .
Now, of course, this is a one-sided story; but we had the
means of testing the truth, in a great measure, as well as
the character of Mr. Hunt for probity; and on this we have
relied. _But in addition to this, we have the fact of this
claim being settled before Mr. Pierson's death, and in fear
of a lawsuit, upon terms proposed by Mr. B. Folger and
Mr. Pierson; and, therefore, on terms which they thought
just-and this, certainly, ought to have shielded Mr. Hunt
from any insinuations. Mr. Hunt is yet in friendly inter-
course with Mr. B. Folger, and was the adviser and- cor-
rector of that address to the public, in the name of Mr. B.
Folger, in answer to some statements _of Matthias about pro-
perty, when first in custody; the facts, however, were fur-
nished by Mr. B. Folger. This address may be seen page
24.1 of Stone's book. lt is a curious fact, too, that Mr. Hunt
was applied to, to write the book which Mr. Stone has writ-
ten, or one on that subject, from facts to be furnished by Mr.
B. Folger; but Mr. Hunt declined, The book, therefore,
published by Mr. Stone, may be regarded as the joint pro-
duct of Mr. Stone and Mr. and Mrs. B. Folger, the latter
supplying the ,body of the materials; while the Rev. Mr.
Somers assisted in fumishing what items were thought ad-
visable to publish. A

_
The opinion of Mr. Hunt on Matthias we have already
snasrrvn or xunlnu. 67-
given;
viz. that he might be sincere, in whole or in part,
ut that he was not a sensible man; and as he believes, he
is partially deranged. His opinion of the property is, that
Matthias might at one time~have secured any quantity of it
to himselilbut that he did not; and really obtained no more
than he expended about his person in the little finery he
displayed. He supposes Mr. B. Folger got rich from ne-
cessity; being, as he expressed himselii in harness, con-
nected with others in a wholesale house, where he made
money from necessity--not abilit ; and that as soon as he
had left that concern, he got rid'of it as quick as he well
could. He considers that he did suffer great';,losses; and
he accounts much more
readily for the diminution of Mr.
Folger-'s property, than for that of Mr. Pierson's. Mr. Pier-
son
spent eleven thousand dollars in machinery, and em-
ployed a Mr. Alexander Shanklin to go to Europe on that
account, especially on account of a
planing machine, (before
he was known to Mr. Hunt;) which was rendered of no
value, by the resistance of the London mechanics, and not
from any defect in the machinery. 'But this patent-right,
and others, Mr. Hunt says, was resold by Mr. Pierson, to
Mr. Folger, forthirty thousand dollars; and that Mr. Pier-
son
actually received a sufficient sum of money to cover his
advances, and that the rest was
paid to his agent in London
in cash or notes; some of the latter, we believe, are
yet unl
paid. Nor can we discover any serious loss sustained
by
Mr. Pierson; except in a note in Mr. Stone's book, whic
supposes a loss to both him and Mr. Folger by stock-job-
bing. Mr. Folger accounts for his failure by endorsements
to large amounts, and to a want of confidence in his credit-
ors, in consequence of his
supposed expenditure about the
kingdom., Matthias gave us t e same account; and he sup-
posed that Mr. Pierson's property was much overrated,
even by himself, from various motives.
Upon inquiry about the patents and machinery, we find
they were all useful inventions; even the selFloading cart
has the approbation of some of our ablest men: they were
intended to save labour, in cutting down banks, and in mak-
ing and improving roads.

with Mr. Hunt, in the land agency business, holding an

at 292 Bleeker-street; and this renders the

Tun heads of the kingdom were now in New York:
but Mr. Pierson was left at Mount Zion with Catherine
and the young people. In about a week after the flight of
Matthias from Sing-Sing, and the subsequent
departure
of
his matched spirit, she (Mrs. B. Folger) retume to Sing-
Sing, to make further arrangements; and apparently had
considerable influence over Mr. Pierson, as, after this time,
his manners changed considerably. I-le interfered in the
kitchen, to the annoyance of Isabella; and he used Mrs. B.
Folger's name, and enforced her authorit , as the Mother,
in a manner which he before did not; but her influence
on another subject was now apparent' for, on this visit, it
was arranged that Mr. Pierson should make the formal
application to his su
posed matched spirit, then in the coun-
try, the married ladp referred to in our first part, and so
much abused by Coii Stone, whose wife she had gently re-
proved for her' excessive gayness. This was about two
months before the death of Mr. Pierson: he was then in
health, but subject to fits, accompanied by some singulari-
ties, in perfect keeping with the practices in the kingdom,
of which we shall afterward speak.
In a
day or two after Mrs. B. Folger's arrival at Sing-
Sing, Mr. Pierson set off on a
joumey of eighty miles, on
a formal visit, to demand that the lady above alluded to
should be given up to him, as his matched spirit, agreeable
to visions first seen b Mrs. B. Folger two years previous,
and to visions which he had since seen. But as the history
of this singular event has been
already recorded, together
with the result, and the base insinuatlon of Col. Stone on
that subject, we must refer our readers to that record for
the particulars now: see first part, pages 31, 2, 3, 4, 5.-»

.Mm-B., Folger took in it at this time: in fact, Matthias
was not fond 'of this lady, and didnot want herapproxima-
tion; for she would have prevented his residence at Zion
Hill, Sing-Sing, if she could. g
Mr. Pierson called at Third-street house, New York, on
his
gpumey,
and there the opinion of Matthias was gi-ven ;
but e so r sanctioned it, that when Mr. Pierson returned
to New York, disappointed, Matthias characteristically ob-
served, "
The time had not yet come." Matthias too, at
this period, made his flying visit to Sing~Sing, with four
horses, to the surprise of the villagers vho heard of it, but
We do not know that he entered the village, as the house
lay a considerable distance on the New York side: his ob-
ject was evidently twofold; to fulfil one of his own
prophe-
cies, and to astound his enemies, by an elevation after his
persecution: the people, however, thought him mad. He
did not then remain long, nor did Mrs. B. Folger re-
turn with him; but he took his three boys away, and his
carpenter's tools; we su pose he then gave up the idea of
a temple at Sing-Sing. gn his return, Mr. Pierson and
Isabella went to Sing-Sing; for, as she could perform all.
country work, her services were more desired there; and
Catherine returned with Mrs. B. Folger to New York,
where Mr. B. Folger then resided, and where Ashe could
be more useful; and this arrangement remained till one
week before the death of Mr. Pierson.
'
About this period, however, perha s in the absence of
Mrs. B. Folger, occurred that proof oi)the strong affection
of Matthias for Mrs. B. Folger which we before gave; viz.
his kissing her garments, which hung in a clothes closet,
ingeniously contrived in the passage of the house in Third-
strwt; which passage he would frequently pace, exclaim-
ing to himself "
Poor Mother! Lovely creature! Oh, the
dear soul!" &.c. Perhaps these proofs of Matthias' affec-
tion for hir! B. Folger were connectedwith his circum-
stancesvand heightened by a suspension of conjugal rights,
_which hejeneradly enjoyed. For afterithe return of the
hlllltly-WQ. New York, on~the,occasion= of Matthias losing

that night with his wife, this gentleman, it appears, did not
give her
up immediately, but continued to sleep with her in
New Yor ,
openly, for three or
four days at least; and
though friendly to Matthias, he et retained his wife, appa-
rently, however, against her willi '
,
And now another ridiculous scene was to be exhibited
in the kingdom, for Mrs. Folger at length declined sleep-
ing any longer with her husband; when he, without quar-
re ling, as far as we know, refused her to Matthias. But,
as the vere living together in one house, and as she ac-
knowlbdged Matthias as her spouse, or matched spirit, such
a denial was of' course useless; except to make them all
partially uncomfortable, by occupying different beds. This
was all it could do; for as Mr. B.'Folger left the house, to
go down town to business, there could be no
impediment to
any
intercourse between her and Matthias, except by any
su den or
unexpected return of' Mr. B. Folger: and these
circumstances gave additional employment to Isabella, and
she was intrusted with a new
charge, being occasionally
placed as a sentinel, or
outpost, to give early intimation of
Mr. B. Fo1ger's approach, while she was closeted with
Matthias, whom alone she acknowledged as her spouse;
and these kindnesses no doubt increased his affection for
her. Arrangements were, however, again made, and Mrs.
B. Folger was
again given up to Matthias; and Isabella
lost her ofiice, her services being no longer necessary ln
that way.
~
There is one
person of the kingdom whom we have
scarcely mentioned, because no act of his was
sufficiently
prominent; et, as a` believer, one ofthe kingdom, and a
member of the family, and as faithful and well s ken of,
he deserves a niche recorded in this account of 3; king-
dom. Besides, he knows the truth of' these statements, less
from observation than fi-om familiarity ,in the kitchen, and
conversation with Isabella, and es ially with Catherine,
whose love he afected to
inspire. gill; he was
only a tailor
-"a little bit of a fellow/ as Isabella expresses herself;
and not
very straight, and an Englishman: but he a rs

ning: and besides the religious exercises in the kingdom,
now reduced to a small quantity, he made clothes for the
children,_worked in the garden, and about the coach and
horses.
'
Catherine declared, she would not have such a bit
ofa fellow; and if she could not have Mr. B. Folger, she
would have none.
'
_.At the breaking up of the kingdom, Henry, the little
tailor, received twenty dollars, and went to his friends in
Ohio. About this time, too, Lewis, a German, joined the
family, but remained pretty much in New York, with the
carriage. This man was called to the trial of Matthias, at
Wliite Plains.
'
There were several other believers in Mr. Pierson and
Matthias, not of the family, and some
apparently ver sen-
sible men, vho thought Mr. Pierson more than ordinary
humanity, from the amiableness of his conduct, his profound
judgment in ordinary aH`airs, and his very great knowledge
of the Scriptures: while they attributed the excesses, in
relation to his wif`e's death, to intense feeling, affection, and
grief at his loss. e
From this time to the near proximation of Mr. Pierson's
death, nothing; material occurred. Mr.-B. Folger continued,
occasionally, to show marks of dissatisfaction, and disbelief;
and again a return of faith and reconciliation: the most re-
markable circnmstance during this period, was the influence
his wife yet retained over him; this vas noticed by those
within the kingdom, and his neighbours, some of whom
were now satisfied of an
improper influence exerted by Mat-
thias; indeed, in the moments of his dissatisfaction, Mr. B.
Folger would complain of this influence, and yet his wife,
while bestowing her favours on others, could call him from
the conversation of those whom she suspected of' advising.
him, and always retained over him the influence of a mia#
trees, if not of a wife; indeed she did not appear to wish tbl
give him up entirely; or to wish any one to have agreaterf
influence over him than herself -.

About a week previous to the death of Mr. Pierson, the

diately after the death of Mr. Pierson: this circumstance
should be remarked, for some of the nearest relations of
Mr. Pierson, dissatisfied _about the property, speak diare
spectfully of Mr. B. Folger, as if ln: had neglected, or in
some
way promoted the death of Mr. Pierson, while from
his business habits, and attention to other things, there does
not appear to be the least ground for any such imputation.
Still, Mr. Pierson was neglected in his last illness, while all
the family, with the exception just made, were present.
This subject requires particular attention; it has never been
understood; neither did the Coroner's lnquest extract the
truth, nor did it come out at the time of the trial of Matthias,
nor is it explained in Mr. Stone's vork, from matter fur-
nished by Mr. and Mrs. Folger. 'l`he facts, briefly expressed,
are these :-
V
It has been already noticed that Mr. Pierson, though ex-
tremely modcst in his deportment, was of an amative dispof
sition, which increased. the severity in the loss of his wife.
Indeed, after her death, we have evidence of his practising
onanism for a considerable period; not however alter his
sickness, a short time before Matthias came to Sing-Sing:
aiier this period he had fits, vhich gradually increased in
frequency and severity till near his death, vhile on the few
last days. he had a number of lighter fits in succession, to-
gether with sickness at the stomach. These fits came on
gradually, as Iits sometimes do; they affected his sinews
and muscles, drawing his head on _one side, and almost
round: and vhile in these fits, he vould utter singular
sounds, atfirst unintelligible, and then less so, as the fit in-
creased in strength; while his gestures were
very singular,
and sometimes disgusting; if~a
person ought to feel disgust,
at the actions of a sick man, insensible, and in a tit. Mr.
Pierson'
appeared
conscious of something ridiculous or dis-
gusting in, is manners while in these tits, for he frequently
asked' persons about him, whether he said or did any thing
wrong while the lit was on him, and seemed very anxious
to avert, both the fits and their consequences; and for that
purpose gave particular instruction to some of the homo
ol : Isabella he instructed to strike the palms of his hanh

'
75
and the strong sinews on his neck, when the fit was about
to draw his head on one side or around, and to rub him in
various
parts, and restrain him from any improper act.
When his fits came on when at table, as
they sometimes
did, Matthias would lead him from the table into another
room, agreeable- to his wish, as Mr. Stone says, in his ax:-
count of Mr. Pierson's sickness, page 195 and following.
The reason -for this will appear evident, but we do not see
why he should be leit alone, and the door shut, as Mr. and
Mrs. Folger relate in Mr. Stone's book, even if he had
wished it. When these fits were coming on, the presence
of particular persons affected him in a singular way, and-
especially the presence of Mrs. B. H. Folger: if she ap-
peared in the commencement of his fit, he would look ut
her intensely, stretching forward his head and one of his
hands, as if he would draw her to him, and exclaim Ann,
Ann, Ann, Ann, Ann, &c. &c., repeating with greater ra-
pidity, and looking more eagerly and wildly as the fit ad-
vanced; he would also alternate this expression with the
exclamation, looking at her as before, and exclaiming, my
wife! my wife! my wife! &c. &c., repeating more
rapidly
as the fit grew stronger. Du ring this time, while endeavour-
ing to approach her with one hand extended, he would feel
about his person with the other within his clothes. His
whole appearance at such times excited disgust in that lady,
abd she would leave his presence as soon as
possible, using
even the term brute, to express her disgust; Matthias too,
would attempt to rouse him on such occasions, to a sense
of impropriety, by exclaiming,
"
Why, Elijah! what are
you saying, what are
you about 2" while other persons
would remove his hand, and bold him. When these fits
came on in bed, Mr; Pierson would generally throw him-
-self out of bed; and this led Matthias to observe, that he had
a Devil which appeared to like the iioor best, and therefore
some bed-clothing were laced on the floor, on which he
sometimes lay. These bedliclothes he would frequently draw
to him as if embracing a
person, still making singular ex-
clamations, or, in the strength of his lit, unintelligible noises,
and using improper gestures, which made his friends inter-
f

ire, md endeavour to rouse him; especially would Mat-

this asbefore explained: betweal these fit:
he appar tolerably well, and even walked in the garden,
nfew days before his death, as related by Mr. Stone, p. 193,
and in our first part, p. l5, in the account we there gave of
the blackberry feast and sickness. In reference to what we
have just said, it will now be seen
why Matthias led Mr.
Pierson from the table when the fits were coming on; and
wh Isabella slapped him on the face, as
reported in Mrs
Fo&cr's evidence, at Matthias trial, and from which unha-
vourahle impressions were drawn; still Mr. Pierson's man-
ners while in the fits had excited a
degree of acknowledged
disgust, mingled with pity, and a desire to assist him; and
when to these fits, sickness was added, the pity and sympa-
thy of the family were increased, but this was partly para-
lyzed by an
increasing disgust, the consequences of his
sickness. The blackberries eaten, mentioned in the 15th
page, part the first, which were said to contain poison, were
eaten on the 28th of July; the next day he was vrell, and
eat more blackberries from the bushes, and on the afternoon
of that day, he was taken sick and vomit-sd, bringing up,
not the supposed poisoned blackberries, eaten twenty-four
hours before, as Mr. Stone very unphilnsophically intimates,
but. as we
suppose. the blackberries which he had last eaten.
Nothing it appears would then stay on his stomach; and
as he wore a long beard, we have no doubt that his appear-
ance was disgusting, but at the same time most pitiable;
besides, his bowels were relaxed, and at one
period he was
helpless. Catherine's sickness, mentioned in Stone's book
as following the consumption of blaclcberries then supposed
poisoned, arose from disgust at the appearance of Mr. Picr-
son, and continued only while the nausea remained. Mat-
thias took Mrs. B. Folger out ofthe room, especially to pre-
vent her being sick, and succeeded, though she had eaten
heartily of the blackberries, and not -just tasted them, as she
lays in Mr. Stons's book. Matthias also left the room, ex-
pressing
a belief that he should be sick if he remained, and
sabella, the coloured woman, was the only person who
would, or indeed could assist him, when most he needed
0
ruaasnvl: or |sAnnLr.A. 77
help; and she could scarcely restrain from being sick her-
self As the parties had means, Mr. Pierson ought to have
had one or more nurses, exclusively to attend him, and
keep him clean; for it was not possible for those in the
family to do justice to him, and continue their services in
the emily; Nor did they do what they might, partly from
disgust, and partly from the attentions which Matthias and
M rs. B. Folger were paying to each other, and thus ne-
glecting the necessar orders; Isabella was even reproved
for _her officiousness, because, being cook, her employment
was
incompatible with attention to Mr. Pierson. It does
not appear either that they had once thought of his death,
nor did he apparentl ; he seemed principally affected by
his fits, and these hehad had for a long while; nor did the '
appear much to hurt him, as he was well in the interval,
and the additional sickness was not apparently alarming.
He retained his senses, and had so
firmly expressed his
opinions about physicians and medicine, that no medical
aid could be given him; in this respect his firmness vas
equal to that of Matthias. This is evident from Mrs. Fol-
gt-r's evidence at the trial of Matthias, and also, from her
evidence before the coroner. Ve cannot learn that .there
was
any abuse, or even designed neglect; considerable
services were rendered him, but not near enough ; his linen
was seldom changed. Isabella was sent into the hay-field
a
large part of three days by Mrs. B. Folger,
"
to help poor
Father gather up his hay," and Mr. Pierson became then
'really filthy. Mrs. Folger did or could do but little, and
Matthias was
haying, and unwilling to use means; he had-
alwuys spoken against it in the time of health, and b a
system of dieting he had preserved the family in healih,
without physicians or medicine; his system, which had
some good in it, alike banished the medicine of the regular
doctor, and the pills of the quack, to which Mrs. Folger
had been devoted before her acquaintance with him. Had
Pierson got better without medicine, Matthias would have
'ascribed it to faith, as he did on a former occasion : and yet
we have it as a fact, that Matthias instructed Lewis to go
br a
physician, if Mr. Pierson wished it, und this evidence-
7' _

he would have given, had any defence been necessary or
gone into ori Mltthias' trial, yet Matthias would not` him-
self send for one.
'
~On the evening when Mr. Pierson was first taken sick,
there was more alarm, or apprehension, than even on the
last day, for his fits were then more powerful, and had been
increasing. On that evening, when he had vomited, and
when in the night his bowels were so deranged, Isabella
and his daughter sat up with him, while Matthias and Mrs.
B. Folger retired to rest, she retiring first as before described,
lest she should be sick, and Matthias following her. In the
progress of his last sickness, which lasted from the 29th of
July, to the 5th of August, his vomiting was less severe,
and his fits less strong, and the first alarm having subsided,
it was supposed he was getting better; the worst symptom
being interpreted for the best, for want_ of correct medical
knowledge; for his fits being less strong, was probably the
effect of declining strength of body.
On the morning of the 5tli, (the night of which he died,)
Mrs, Dratch, a Jewess, a sort of disciple of Matthias, and a
widow, came to see Mr. Pierson, from whom she had re-
ceived some acts of kindness, and from whom she then ex-
pected more. She conversed chiefly with Matthias, with
whom she was familiar, but wished to see Mr. Pierson.
This request vas not at first noticed, but when she repeated
her request, Matthias replied that he vished Mr. Pierson to
take a varm bath first. None, of his family, however; vished
to expose him in his fits, from his singular behaviour, and
now _he was
scarcely decent from partial neglect and other
circumstances. And to this request, perhaps, Mr. Pierson
was indebted for the warm bath, which merclyas a measure
of cleanliness ought to have been administered before.
Mrs. Folger directed the bath to be prepared, and Isabella
immediately got it ready, and with the assistance of Lewis,
put him into it, and she perceiving a tit coming on while
putting him in the bath, Isabella slapped him on the neclr,
or side of the face and neck, as before explained, _as the
wish of Mr. Pierson, and exclaimed, with the characteristic
of one of the kingdom, "como out of your hellish sleep,"
ruxnrrrvn or |us||.r.A. 29'
_ind this was the slap at the spirit, which appeared in the
absence ofher evidence, as an act ofcruelty, ofa very strange
character. From the bath Mr. Pierson was taken to bed,
and Mrs. Dratch was informed that she should see him in'
the morning. But that night he died, and died alone; for
Matthias and Mrs. B. Folger had retired to bed together,
for they did_ not consider it necessary that any one should
sit upwith him. Isabella, it ap rs, would have attended
to him, but after Mrs. Folger ham roved her for oflicious-
ness, she did not like to; besides, Niis. Folger complained
of her to Matthias, and declared that Isabella was
always in
Mr. Piersonls room, running in ever minute as soon as
her back was turned; and Matthias had scolded her, for
disobe ing Mrs. B. Folger. And thus Mr. Pierson was
partiall' neglected. ~
The last scene observed by Isabella immediately before
the death of Mr Pierson, is thus described by her: Mrs.
Dratch, after offering to sit up with Mr. Pierson, and that
offer being declined, retired up stairs to bed. Matthias,
also, soon after retired into his room, and apparently fell
asleep or dosed; when Mrs. B. Folger entered his and her
room,_and leaning against the bed was _in the act ol' with-
drawing her stockings, when Isabella approaching the
chamber door, vhich stood partlyyopen, thus s oke to her.
Isabella. Mother, what is best for me to db; stay "p
with Mr. Pierson, or go to bed? (Here Mrs. B. Fo ger,
throwing herself into bed, and turning to Matthias, repeated
the question thus.)
Mis. B. Folger. Father, what is.best for Isabella to do:
sta up, or go to bed? r
_
if/rtthias. (Turning round and speaking quickly,) How
is Elijah 'Z I
-
Mrs. B. Folger. Well, he is somewhat better.
Matthias. Well, Isabella, you had better go to bed.
Isabella went to bed as instructed. She had been
sitting
up, or lying on chairs several nights previous, and fet
weary; she did not then think him in dying circumstances,
although she did think it very likely, that he would die
suddenly, from his tits. In the morning she was
acquainted
O
80 runnnrvn or IIAIILLA.
with Hr. Pierson's death, by Matthias calling, to her, and
informing her of that event. _ And on coming down stairs,
she found Mrs. B. Folger lying down in the childrzenls
room, in the north wing, showing that that lady must have
been up before; and thus agreeing with her narrative in
Mr. Stone's book, where she says, that she was
up with Mr.
Pierson during the night, but not exactly in his room at the
moment of his death.
In the evidence given by Mr. Folger, on the trial, some
things are not correctl '
stated. There it was shovn, that
Matthias had dropped water in the mouth of Mr. Pierson
from a height, while he could scarcely swallow, and thus
performed an act of cruelty. This we have examined
minutely into; and though there might have been an
appa-
rent carelessness in Matthias' manner, we are satisfied that
the act was one of kindness. Mr. Pierson could not
drink;
his lips were closed, and his mouth full of phlegiu. As
Mr. Pierson could not drink, it appeared to Matthias that it
would afford him some relief to drop water between his
lips, drop by drop, which, by their wcight,,1night penetrate
into his mouth; while Isabella, on her knees, and with a
soli towel in her hand, hung over Mr. Pierson's head, and
wiped away the plilegm as it was
displaced by the drops of
water; and this defence vould have been given, had any
defence of Matthias 'been necessary. Our opinion is, that
this fact is a
strong proof that Mr. Pierson had attention
paid him, if not all that he ought to have had: it is, we
say, a
proof of attention, and not of cruelty. The descent
of the water was not a foot; in fact, not more than it ought
to have been to effect such a pur ose.
During Mr. I'ierson's illness, he asked Isabellafs forgive-
ness. And this fact is noticed by Mrs. B. I-I. Folger as
something very mysterious; and in consequence of which
we have inquired into it. We find it a fact; and Isabella
supposes Mr. Pierson referred to his altered manners some-
time before his illness, when he interfered more. and was
less kind. She also supposes he referred to her increased
labour with thc-'double spirit, the git? of Matthias and Mrs.
Folger, frequently referred to; espcrially by Mrs. Folger,

l we have learned since our former notice of it. She sup-
poses that Mr. Pierson felt conscious of this imposition,
which arose out of the indulgences of Matthias and his
matched spirit, _
In the morning after Mr. Pierson's death, Matthias en-
hred his room; and finding him dead, retumed to Mrs.
Folger, and informed her of it. Mrs. Folger soon inform-
ed others of 'the family, and Mr. Pierson's daughter, into
whose room she had entered and laid down. The whole
hmily were much surprised, as
they did not acknowledge
either sickness or death. Matthias, however, remarked,
that Pierson wanted faith; and for that his body was not
permitted to enjoy the kingdom, but the good part of his
spirit remained among them.
The death of Mr. Rierson had no effect on the faith of
the
disciples, as Mr. Stone supposes. Mrs. Folger was as
full of faith as ever, as she soon alter manifested before the
coroner; nor was her love diminished. Matthias, who was
on
very good terms with Mrs. Dratch, explained to her why
Hr. Pierson must die; and in the afternoon, on her depart-
re, gave her money, as she had been disappointed in see-
ing Mr. Pierson, from whom she expected relief
Mrs. Dratc`h, at the request of Mrs. Folger, called on
Mr. Folger, in New York, who had then just retumed from
his joumey in the North; and when informed of the event,
he wrote to Mr. Pierson's brother, Mr. Mahlon Pierson,
Bottle Hill, New Jersey: he also communicated the fact to
Mr. Pierson's relations in New York, and some of whom
prepared to come to Sing-Sing immediately, with Mr. B.
Folger. In the mean time, as Mrs. Dratch, or Mr. Bishop,
a
neighbour, had mentioned the death of Mr. Pierson as
sudden, in Sing-Sing, a coroner's inquest was held in the
aiernoon of that day, and
`
Mrs. Folger and Isabella, with
others, were examined. .
From Isabella we learn, that the jury were more inqui-
sitive of her and ,Henry, at least, about where the partiet
slept, than other subjects; and they got so far as an ac-
knowledgment that Mr. B. Fol er and his wife 'did not
sleep together: but nothing further was then elicited on
82 '

that subject, from the caution observed. And as the jury
were prying into subjects not
,properly
before them, Isabella
replied. with some tartness; y
or one asked her, "
what had
become of Pierson's devil, or evil spirit 2" when she took
the liberty of
`
replying, that it might have entered into one
of them; -
V
.
,
Mrs. Folger's replies on this occasion, as given by her-
self in Mr. Stone's book, show that she then retained her
full faith. _The following is an extract from page 208 of
Mr. Stone's work :-
'
_
-
"
Mrs. Folger was the fiflh person examined' She in-
formed them that her husband was
absent; and, as she was
ignorant of legal matters, vished to know if they had a
right to proceed as
they
were doing. They replied, that
their proceedings were a l legal. She then detailed to them
all the particulars of Mr. Pierson's sickness and death.
She said she did not consider this event as
_they did, a visit-
ation of Providence; but that the devil, death, had robbed
,us of the body of Mr. Pierson, while his spirit was as much
with us as ever.
,They asked if Mr. Pierson had had medi-
cine
given him :-she replied, no-that they considered
medicine an evil-that Mr. Pierson would not have taken
any while he had his senses, and violence had not been
done to his often expressed sentiments on this point, ailer
he had lost his senses.
They inquired if Mrs. Folger
would not employ a
physician if she were herself sick:
she said, no-that she had already passed through the
hands of so
many, that she feared her body might yet be
rejected from entering the kingdom of heaven. They asked
several questions relative to Mr. Pierson's_property and
business with Mr. Folger: she replied, that she knew no
particulars respecting it; referred them to her husband,
whom she believed to be a correct business man, and that
they might rest assured he would render a true and accu-
rate statement of all his transactions with Mr. Pierson-
Iha! She knew. from their conversations, that they had con-
fidence in each other, and were partners in some kind of
business; and inconclusion, said, if they had an more
inquiries to make, she would like to hear them. Sllie then

mentioned, that there were some marks on the skin of Mr.
Pierson, which were occasioned by his knockinghis feet
together while in the fits; but if they found any marks of
violence on his body, 'or
were not satisfied, they would
oblige her by letting her know it. Mrs. Folger then lefl
the room, and supposed they examined the body.
Matthias, in the mean time, had sent for one of the neigh-
hours, Mr. Bishop, and induced him to make arrangements
for the funeral; when the body was to have been buried
next day (Thursday) at noon. But Mr. B. Folger, accom-
panied by a Mrs. Bishop, the cousin, and a married sister of
Mr. Pierson, arrived; and these desired the body to be re-
moved to Morristown, near which Mr. Mahlon Pierson,
the brother of Mr. Pierson, resides: and there it was taken.
But on the 18th of August it was disinterred, and carefully
examined, by Drs. Condicts and others; and the stomach,
with its contents, carefully packed in u
jar, and sent to Dr.
Torr , a chemist, for examination. No proof whatever
couldybe found of oison; but a
variety of ingenious sup-
positions were madpe, from some slight appearances about
the gullet and stomach. The fact is, the limiily, aher the
alarm raised by Mr. Folger about the coffee poison, evi-
dently believed Mr. Pierson poisoned-the physicians
thought it probable, and they wished to discover something
of the kind. The suspicion then fell on Matthias; and this
continued till his trial at VVl1ite Plains, in April, 1835 ;-
when the prejudice was so much against him, that one of
the jury, on that trial, has sinde informed us, that /tc vrislted
to find Matthias guilty. The result of that trial is known;
and in spite of every evidence being brought up, and' facts
perverted, like the dropping ofthe water into Mr. I'icrson's
mouth, and the blackberry story-in spite ofthe prejudice
of the
judge, the oiiicers of the court, the people, and the
jury-the judge was
obliged to declare, that the evidence
did not warrant Matthias being put u on his defence. It
is true he was ably defended by Mr. gvestern, and a less
able man might have been eowed before the prejudices and
power arrayed against him. ~
We are not disposed to' justify Matthias; nay, we eva

think that Mr. Pierson might have lived alittle longer UQ
other treatment; but we can see no act of deliberate desigl
to shorten his life, either by any slow process or more act-
ive agent. Matthias, however, did ascribe the death of Hr.
Pierson to his want of faith; which, he said, he had olr
served since his visit to the married lady whom he wished
to espouse. This is noticed at page 236 of ,Mn Stone'|
work; and this we think possible; indeed, Matthias was
evidentl afraid of her influence.
The dayafter the body of Mr. Pierson was removed from
Sing-Sing, Matthias went to New York in a
carriage, 'and
Mrs. B. Folger and Isabella went tothe same
place in the
steamboat, leaving Catherine and the young people in the
house in Sing-Sing. Two days after the family had gone
to New York, the house at Sing-Sing was taken possession
of by Mr. Barker, the treasurer of thecounty, as the property
of the late Mr. Pierson, and' in trust for his heirs, and a Hr.
[mac 'I'er Boss, and a Mr. Williams, were
put into it as
keepers, and Catherine and the rest of the family were
obliged to remove. This possession of the house was
by
surprise, and consequently every thing was left without
precaution. Mr. Ter Boss now
keeps a tavern at White
Plains; we saw him there, and obtained from him some in-
formation, chiefly, however, in confirmation of our state-
ments, as a good white evidence. On taking possession of
the house, and looking over the rooms, Mrs. B. Folger's
clotheslwere found in Matthias' room. He too had lived
on the spot in Sing-Sing, and had since carried Isabella
from White Plains to Tarry Town, and on the journey had
heard the whole statement, which_ he informed us
agreed
with our account, and thus showed that at least she had
been consistent in that statement. He had, too, a
knowledge
of parts of many of the facts, and of those parts he admitted
her correctness. And thus ve get at another proof of her
veracity. He made, too, a remark that we have already put
in print, viz.: "
that a woman who could neither read or
write, would be incapable of relating so many circumstances,
during a considerable
period, so as to make a comided
story, unless true; or without furnishing the means of dv

Section." On taking possession of the house, 'hy instructions
we suppose of the administrator, Mr. Pierson's brother, (Mr.
Mahlon Pierson,) before mentioned, preparations were made
for selling the furniture, and in a few days Mr. and Mrs.
B. Folger, with Isabella, went again to Sing-Sing, to separate
their property from the late Mr. Pierson's, and while at
Bing-Sing put up at Mr. Crosby's tavern, where Mr. B.
Folger and his wife pccupied one chamber, into which' they
retired early, us Mr., B. Folger apparently manifested some
impatience. On 'the next day, Mrs. Folger returned with
Isabella by the boat, and on the journey, explained to her
the circumstances of Mr. B. Folger, and her future plans.
She stated,that Mr. B. Folger had lost much of his proper-
ty, and had spent her private property also, but that he yet
had some that he had kept back ; and that she advised Mat-
thias taking a farm with part of this money, and retiring
into the West, where she, Isabella, had better go withrhim;
while Mrs. Folger should remain in New York with Mr.
Folger, who would speculatemnd soon obtain
plently
of
money, and they, then, would join Matthias again, -an re~
establish .the kingdom. This subject, alter this time, fre-
quently became one of conyersption, but Mrs. B. Folger
observed, that Matthias was
unwilling to
go. Mr. B. Fol-
get returned to Sing-Sing, and was
present at the sale of
furniture there, and he purchased several articles, and on
his return related that Mr. Burnham, a merchant in' Cedar-
street, had acted us agent for Mr. Pierson, and finding a
drawer full of papers, he had turned them all out and stuffed
them in his pockets. Mrs. B. Folger remarked that,among
those. papers were Mr. Pierson's experience papers; and
'among them was her note to Mr. Pierson; this was said with
apparent concern,.and at the same time with a half la-ugh
and finally the laugh prevailed, making it a
subject
amusement. VThis, we suppose, has reference to the
ublished by Mr. Stone, containing her vision in
relatgse
r. Picrsoh and her cousin. Mr. Stone, who had
seryhad

tions from day
today;
and hence we believe, that this"
'would confirm muc of our statements: indeed we know t
-dues for the possessor has very naturally made it the sub-
ject 'of conversation with his friends, and some of the coa-
tants have been recounted to us, and others are published
'in Mr. Stone's book, and which agreeing with what we have
'positive proof for, we know to becorrectly related. Mr.
'Burnham professes to hethe deadly enemy ofMatthias, while
Mr. Pierson`s family do not think Mr. B. Folger worthy
'of respect; we cannot therefore conceive why important
Licts honestly recorded in Mr. Pierson's diary, illustrative
of the singular events at Sing-Sing, should be withheld from
any motives of delicacy, especially when many of those
facts are isolated and separated from Mr. Pierson, whose
sincerity no one doubts. It is however a fact, that Mr.
Pierson destroyed considerable portions of his memoran-
dums, just before his death, at the suggestion bf Matthias,
-who preached against so much writing, and himself was
so prudent as not to commit any thing to writing.
'
We -have before stated, that Matthias held much of the
property of Mr. Pierson, and hc had in his possession the
title deeds of such property. After the sale of the goods at
Sing-Sing, Mr. Burnham, as the agent of Mr. Mahlon Pier-
son, and as at more fit person to transact business, waited
upon Matthias to obtain from him the title deeds, accompa-
nied with a friend. Mr. Stone relates that Matthias had
-agreed to give them up before their arrival, from a conver-
vsatinn ,with Mr. B. Folger, and he gives a characteristic ac-
count of this meeting. Matthias seated himself in a
rocking
chair, and commenced preaching to them, exclusively occu-
pying the time, and when at last they became impatient, he
declared that he should test the strengthof the Gentile law;
and he afterward said to Mr. Folger, that the spirit had in-
,
vrmed him, that he must not give up the property of God,
_the devil; The panies of course left him in rnuch irrita-
nhoand without effecting their object. On a second visit,

_-We return now to the affairs of the kingdom, which grew
worse and worse. Mr. B. Folger's discontent continued;
and though- he had again given up his wife, he evidently
sought every opportunity of indulgence; and as the price
of which; he became extremely polite to Matthias; while
Mrs. Folger, who evidently loved Matthias, not
only chose
to indulge her husband occasionally, b'ut evidently wished
to hold him to her affections, but inferior to Matthias, and.
consequently gave him many gracious smiles.: and while
caressing Matthias, or one of his little boys, would some-
times, by a
peculiar wink, (certainly not very digniI'ied,)`
convey an idea to Mr. B. Folger, that she was not wholl
devoted to Matthias, but still held him and her other child:
ren in her affections. Matthias apparently began to see
this, and he became a little dissatisfied. He frequently ex-
claimed, that he did not want quite so much politeness on
the part of Mr. B. Folger; that he doubted some of its sin-
cerity: indeed he appeared to think it cost too
much; and
when Mrs. B. Folger proposed taking a
journey with her
husband to Albany, Matthias opposed it. But upon her
representing to him, that Mr. Folger had sacrificed much
for him, she thought, as he wished it very mucfh, she might
so far indulge him as to accompany him in this journey.
The journey was undertaken, and Mrs. B. Folger slept
with her husband while thus travelling, either with or with-
out the knowledge of Matthias.
It should be remarked here, that Mr. B. Folger had made
several journeys to Albany during the summer; and when
there, that he visited the family of Matthias: this we learn-
ed from Mrs. Matthias; but whether Mr. Folger renewed
his acquaintance with her daughter. or not, we do not
know. Yet Mrs. Matthias has this note in her little book:
-"Matthias by his wife," page 36,-" Mr. B. Folger often
came to Albany on business, and called at our house. I
Suppose his object still was, to influence
myadaughter,
and*
in some way to get her to join them, and ome his sub-
stitutefor his wife, whom he had given to Mr. M.'f (Mat-

thins.) On the occasion of one of these visits Mrs.Mat1hias
remarks,
"
I then told him how_I felt towards Mrs. B. (Fol-
ger,) and how sinful I thought her conduct to be." And
he (Mi. B. Folger) replied, that "
she was as pure as an an-
gel in the sight of heaven." "
I told him, that 'I looked up~
on her as no better than any other woman of ill-fame; and,
in many respects, I thought her to be worse." (See
"
Mat-
thias," by his wife, page 36.)
'
Notwithstanding these opinions, and that these opinions
were known to Mr. B. Folger, Mrs. Folger afterward visitr
ed Mrs. Matthias, the legal wife of Matthias, in New York,
and no
caps were
pulled; Matthias' wife making no other
pretensions than that of a
poor woman, while Mrs. Folger
sustained the character of the lady; and she very conde-
scendingly remarked, that she was
agreeably surprised at
the manners and appearance of Mrs. Matthias, whom she
complimented on the expression of her cduntenance: in fact,
both the wife and the spouse of Matthias agrceably deceived"
each other. '
On the return of Mr. Folger and his 'wife from the North,
Mr. Folger was unwilling to give up 'his wife, although
she was very far gone in the family way, with the expected
holy son`of` Matthias, in whom there vas
yet much faith;
and the subject was now resumed of Matthias going into
the West, to seek a farm. After some manifestations ofdis-
satisfaction, on the part of Matthias and Mr. B. Folger, the
former resolved upon leaving the family, at least for a time,
and set out on a
journey, and reached as far as
Newark;
and Mr. B. Folger slept that night with his wife. When
Matthias left, he wept, and evidently went, more at the desire
of Mr. B. Folger than his own. Hc.took with him nobag-
ge, and must consequently- have 'ineant to retum: yet,
gram what follows, he appears to have left his return un-
certain, as well as the
place of his retreat.
In this Bight Matthias compared himself to David, and
Mr. B. Folger to his unruly son Absalom, warring against
his father. The fact is, that Matthias had scarcely left the
house when Mrs. Folger commenced the most doleful lam-
entations, and manifesting me greatest marks of dhtressw
_
,s5rts.n_rxv5,,0|. IMIIIQLQ- QD*
pp# yet this was not three weeks before the kingdom vas'
dissolved. Her distress was so great, that it affected those
about her, and drew the attention of the whole household:
even the little son of Matthias noticed and reported it to his
mother, when he got back to
Albany, (and she informed us
of it 5) while Isabella vas perfectly astonished at what she
called her "taking on so." Mr. B. Folger, too, .became
distressed at the unhappiness of his wife ; and being melt~
ed into sympathy, remarked, that ifthis was the consequence
of Matthias' departure, he could have no comfort with her,
and consequently wished him back. Among other expres-
sions of grief she used this, just previous to Matthias' de-
parture:
"
How can I live if Father goes awa !" Alter
is departure she said to Mr Folger,
*'
What has beconye
of him Z". To which the good~natured husband replied, that
"he would go and see." To Isabella and others she gave
also other reasons, in conjunction with her avowed afl`ection~
for him* for her grief; she remarked, that Mr. Folger would,
perhaps, ill use her when Matthias was
gone. Before his
departure, too, when' 'complaining of altered circumstances,
as the cause why Matthias should leave them for the pro-
Vsent, Isabella, with much simplicity, for etting her occa-
sional angry feelings at Mrs. Folger, olfered to work for
the common good of the kingdom. She had before assisted
Matthias, when his allowance was
stopped by Mr. Pierson;
her offer, of course, only showed her sympathy-it was un--
availing.
'
`
'Matthias who probably knew the effect of his xibsence,
retumed the next day, and was received with open arms;
and Mrs. Folger manifested joy as rapturous, at his return,
as her lamentations had been dolorous; and then followed
Ee lat mockery of marriage, more
solemnly contracted
an fore. .,
'
The church or kingdom was assembled, and Mr. B. Fol~
get assuming the iinnness of a man, and the eness of
`u philosopher, declared to Mrs. Folger insa&e most
solemn manner, that he was then about to give her u for
sur; that after that riod, he would never take her back
again. Then to Catherine, he declared. himself

willing to take her for new but with much aolemnity and
apparent prudence and sageness,
pointed
out to her the di$-
eu ties of her situation ; he foreto d that the world must be-
come acquainted with the facts, and that persecution would
possibly follow; and he then asked her solemnly, if she
was willing to take him -with these prospects, and il' she
felt that she had strength to bear up against the frowns of
the world; concluding with repeating the question, was
she willing to take him for ever? 'I`o which Catherine,
who was unable to make a speech, or to look solemn, only
looked foolish, and'hung her head down, and drawled out
.the accustomed "
Yes, sir." And then appealing to Mrs.
Folger again, Mr. Folger remarked, °'
Now Father takes
you' for ever." The unusual solemnity of Mr. Folger on
this occasion, and the firmness with which he pronounced
the words for crer, seemed to unnerve Mrs. Folger. She
was not accustomed to it; she paused, and faltered, as if
she was aboul to lose the influence she had exerted over
Mr. B. Folger, and this perhaps Matthias observed, and for
the first time, probably, conceived the idea, that Mrs. B. Fol-
ger really wished to retain two strings to her bow. How-
ever, the solemnities closed; the family \vounds were healed,
and the kingdom was
again built up. Harmony reigned
that evening, and Matthias, at night, retired with ~Mrs. B.
Folger, while Mr. Folger led off the young widow; each
of the rties being no\v fixed for ever. We have already
remarfeld, that from Mr. Pierson's death, the beginning of
August, lS34, up to the period we are now
speaking of (a
lapse of about five \\'eeks,) there had been much dissatisfac-
tion,,and the usual course had been observed to obtain
peace.
Mr. B. Folger had been indulged for a time, 'as in his
northern journey, and then put off; when he would inter-
dict Mrs. B. Folger from sleeping with Matthiasl and on
such occasions, Mrs. B. Folger slept with Isabella, and on
these opportunities made to her very free communications,
Whilethe subjectfbfher union with Matthias seemed to occupy
much' of herthoughts. and it became the subject of conver-
sation; besides, being under partial restraint, and denied the
company of Matthias, this perhaps operated in exciting the
A
,
nnnxnl or isnlsu. 91
hagiaation the more
i
Mrs. B` Fol ha6,oa a former
ioeeazion, called the attention of lsabeihirwhen she entered
their bedfoom on a morning, to the subject of her happiness:
ltr as she was laying her head on the board of Matthias,
she remarked, "
Isabella, this you see is my pillow." And
on the present occasion, or when Mrs. B. Folger was in
bed with Isabella, and when Matthias was s ken oi] Mrs.
Folger actually showed Isabella how Mattliias kissed or
embraced her. This, with other facts, shows
clearly, that
the death of Mr. Pierson made no alteration either in the
iith of Mrs. Folger, or in her affections; and it shows most
clearly, that her mind was at least much occupied with her
enjoyments with Matthias, whom she still regarded as her
proper spouse. The account therefore in Stone's book-of
her decline in faith, after Mr. Pierson's death, is incorrect.
We approach now the crisis, the breaking up of -the
kingdom, which is extremely characteristic. For three
weeks after this lastmarriage, which was to bind them for
ever, the parties seemed to get on
tolerably well. But Mrs.
Folger was
probably more attentive to Mr. B. Folger than
before, as she evident] did not wish to lose her influence
over him ; and this perliaps excited or increased the jealous
of Matthias, whom we before remarked did not like so mucli
politeness on the part of Mr. Folger. For three weeks, Mr.
B. Folger seemed to besatisfied with Catherine, but he
Gould not last opt the honeymoon.
`
On Sunda afternoon,
September 15th, 1834, about three weeks after the late mar-
ria e, Mrs. B. Folger went into the garret to lay downon
Isaiellds bed, when Mr. B. Folger, after sometime, followed
her, entered the room, shut the door, and locked it. Now
whether Matthias' suspicions were awake, or whether by
accident, we .know not; but, he too went up to the garret,
and finding it locked, ascertained who were within, and
wb they had locked it; but as he had no legal remedy, he
had'to put up with it. Catherine, who was a party in~
toreoted in this transaction, went into the kitchen, and said
ta Isabella that Father had caught them, or caught ,her at
i. She also complained, that it was too bad that~Mrs. Fol-
ger had two men; and using an exaggeration, declared that

sbelad mniaias all night, and Ben- Folger (nah 3n§
all dny.°'- Soon alter this, Mrs. Folger came down stain,
and said to Isabella, thatMr.Folger had forced htm* but as
he was her legal husband, she had no remedy. Matthim
however, on this occasion, did not impute all the blame to
Mr. Folger, for Mrs. Folger and Matthias after this had
some words for a
day ortwd; and od Tuesday night, Mat-
thias got out of bed, and lelt her." She then also left the
bed, and came up stairs into Isabella's bed, (Catherine was
at that time in bed.with ,Mr. Folger,) and.
lay down with
her, and mentioned the fact of' Matthias' leaving her, and
declared that she could not lav alone, for that 'Pierson's
.spirit haunted her. This she had said several times~bel`o|'e,
and addedfthut if she got out of the bed in the night or in
the dark, that she required Matthias to hold his hands over
her eyes, for she seemed to see Pierson's spiritl Alter a
short time Matthias also came into Isabella's room, appa-
rently to look for Mrs. Folger, and seeing her in bed with
Isabella, he desired the coloured woman to get up, and leave
her, exclaiming that Mrs. Folger was a harlot; and used
the expression,

ln the morning, whmCathcr'ine lell Mr.Folger's room,
Hn. Folger went into R, and did nm come down to break-
hst; but Mr. Folger took ber up coffee: no regular
breakfast waataken that moming. The confusion of the
night, ind the irritated state of the feelings of the party.
took away the appetite; Matthias scarcely eat
any thing,
Isabella very little: and this is the breakfast, and the coffee,
which Mr. B. Folger so
imprndently said was
poisoned,
and for which he recently had to pay to Isabella 2525and and
costs, in a slander suit. Mr. B. Folger now became urgent
with Matthias to leave; still there was no direct quarrel-
ling, and Matthias did not leave that day; this is cf cor:-
seqnence, for the report of the poisoned coffee, supposed
that on the moming of his departure, the coffee was
poi-
soned: in the course of the day considerable alterations
took place: Mrs. Folger appeared again in the iinmily, but
with an altered tone; she now called Mr. B. Folger, hus-
band, a term which she formerly used, but which had been
dropped since she was called mother; and she especially
informed Isabella that she wanted Mr. Folger to be obey-
ed; her tone towards Matthias was altered;~_ and her beau-
1iful soft voice, seemed to have acquired a
harshness; Mat»
tbias was no
longer the favourite, and Mr. Folger was again
taken to be her husband; and Matthias' physical powers
even, were now depreciated. By.what follows, it appears
that Mr. Folger was told by Mrs. Folger, that she had
never enjoyed the Father much, and that she greatly pre-
ferred him, Mr. B. Folger: and as Mr. Folger finds it
extremely difficult to keep any secrets, this led to a
very
curious scene. When most of the family, kingdom, or
church, was assembled by accident in the kitchen. or base-
ment, including Mr. and Mrs. Folger, Matthias Catherine,
and Isabella, Mr. B. Folger, feelin confident in the alfee-
tions of his wife, and perhaps not gtnowingrhow she had
'brmerly diaparaged his physical powers, and knowing
only that the then disparaged those of Matthias, he ven-
tured to :aunt -Mauhiu on

the thrust, and appealed to Mrs. B. Folger for thetmtlldi
hi assertions, _and to confirm what she had formerly said
of Mr. B. Folger, who also appealed to her,`to con§rm
what she had just said of Matthias; being thus appealed
to, by her husband and her spouse, she had resort to her
ingenuity to get out of her difficulty: she said, 'that when
she spoke of Matthias, she did not refer to actual enjoyment,
but that as she had a
complaint,
She falling of the womb,),
and she found that Matthias ma e her better, by replacing
the fallen part, and that in consequence of this benefit she
had thus s >ken of him; but that she greatly preferred
Mr. B. Foliiger, whom she enjoyed most. In the com-
mencement of this discourse, bythe chief leaders in the
kingdom, Isabella was directed to some
employment out of
the kitchen, as had frequently been done before, when any
delicate or
family subject was agitated; but she, feeling
that the kingdom was about to be dissolved, declined obey-V
ing, and chose to stay and hear out this singular dispute,
In the course of the day, however, Mrs. -Folger informed
Matthias that she would not sleep with Mr. Folger till the
child was born; this resolution, however, we
expect was
not kept.
Mr. B. Folger continued more urgent with Matthias, yet
no actual quarrel ensued: he offered Matthias any quantity'
of money, any thing to get rid of him; he saw that the
disaffection of his wife was a favourable opportunity, and
he pressed it, as Matthias told us; he said that Mr. Folger
was with him, as Pharoah with the children of Israel, any
thing to get rid of them, and then to pursue them, as in
his case. Matthias, in reply to the offer of money, remark-
ed, that if he, Mr. B. Folger, #lt as though he had money
which belonged to God, he might give it him; and Mr.
B: Folger gave Matthias D500 on the day of his departure.
Mr. Western, however, shows that this' money was still
given to Matthias to buy a farm, agreeable to the first idea.
Isabella also had
exilgaged
to go, and Mr. and Mrs.
Eolger
insisted on pa ing er wages as a
compensation, an gave
ben $25.5. Heiiiry too had been paid o before this period,
and thus the kingdom was virtually broken up; but

'lhihias just alter that time-, acknowledged only Qto his
wife, at
Albany, that it was necessary that the church
should go into the wilderness for a
time; still adhering to
the notion of a farm, and a reunion. There is something
very curious with this gift of money to Matthias and Isa-
bella, with' after circumstances. The money was given
partly in silver and partly in gold, and Mr. B. Folger
urged that Isabella should take the charge of the gold,
but she declined, and, like a great fool, added her money,
received as
wages, to that given to Matthias, for the good,
we
suppose, of the kingdom. Matthias, however, return-
ed her money before he led the house. It was
very well
t-hat Isabella did not take charge of this gold, for no
sooner was Matthias and Isabella gone, than Mr. Folger
raised reports, not only of her having poisoned his family,
but excited suspicionthat he had been robbed: it appears
one of the failings of Mr. B. Folger, that he could never
get out of one difficult without getting into another; and
we have proofs not' onlyy of his bringing this charge, con-
nected with the other, for which he had to pay 8125; but,
when detected in the last act of grossness, atier giving up his
wife for ever, and taking Catherine for ever, we have proof
of his charging this very act on Matthias, and another per-
son, which if we were to mention, he would be immediately
prosecuted again for slander: we have proof; too, of him
and Mrs.B. Folger, after the whole was settled, going to
Mr. Latourette, in the Bowery, and makingwhere a, reli-
gious confession, acknowledging the very things mentioned
in this book, appearing penitent, spending much time in
pralyer;
and yet, in the midst of this very confession, Mr.
Fo ger imputes sins to others, which would expose him to
u
prosecution if made known ; and to prevent this, he binds
'his confessor to secrecy; but his confessor told it to his
wife ora rtof it and his wife toaMrs 'VIL-Comb in Fourth
`street, andnihis lady mentioned it to a coiisin of Nir. Folger,
whom Stone so much'abuses, and she mentioned a part of

injure the reputation or fame of another, without to
do it openly, destroys our faith, both in the sincerity and
efficacy of the accompanying long prayers and tears; it i
like getting absolution with the purpose of sinning again.
In Mr. Stone's book,_
"
Matthias and his Lmpostures," the
account given of the transactions at Sing4Sing. and in No. 8
Third street house, is avowedly given b Mr. and Mrs. B.
Folger. From such a source we could' have no right to
expect a correct statement of such transactions as we have
related, in which they were the chief actors; and thialilr.
.Stone must have known: and yet he endorses their account
(see page 221 of his work) as "a round nnvarnis-hed tale,"
"
and is, moreover, as far as it goes," as he says,
"
a tale of
unexaggerated, unadorned, and simple truth." Ve cannot
notice all the errors and omissions in this "tsimple truth ;"
but our readers may like to see their version of the few la!
days, and they may amuse themselves by weaving our ac-
count in that published b Mr. Stone; and then, by making
an allowanc_e, from a wisli to shift the blame from their own
shoulders-and from the supposition that Matthias would
not be believed if he wrote-and that the coloured woman
would not be heard, because she could not read or-write-
the accounts then may be reconciled with ours, and will be
found tolerubly minute._ To assist in this explanation we
shall add notes.

as before explained. The last events are then thus noticed
in Mr. Stone's book; see
pages 213, 14, 15, 16, 17. _
"
At length, while Mr. Folger was abroad, Matthias began
to charge Mrs. Folger as being responsible for breaking up
'the kingdom? She would then tell the family, in his
presence, what the circumstances were, but to _little or no
purpose; for, 'as soon as her back was turned, he would
.say so, much to the contrary, as to recall them to believe in
-his statements; and they ,no doubt were aware that it :nigh

be some time before they would he able to find' mother so
independent and well-provided a home.
"
Mr. Folger, at this time,° was much occupiedand tried
in his mind with business perplexities; and finding him
still decided in his determination to separate from Matthias,
Mrs. Folger forbore to mention to him her trials in his ab-
sence from the house, being sustained by the hope of a
speedy delivcrancef from them. But Matthias at last aa-
certaining that Mr. Folger was not to be wrought upon
farther by him, attempted to
terrify Mrs. Folger into a ir-
ther belief of his doctrines. She, however, told him, that
she had not ihith, and therefore could not exercise it. He
asked, if it was then her determination to pursue the course
her husband had pursued; if it was, he added, he had
made the same
sign for her he had inade for Mr. Pierson.
which would not fail. She said firmly, it was. He then
said, at the height of his voice, which was, on the whole,
deafening, stamping at the same time violently with his
feet, she should be D-A-1|-N-r~:-n li Mrs. Folger was much
alarmed, and feared that the earth would open and swallow
her up, or something worse. She was then quite unwell
and vearied, and did not feel sure, for u time, but that some
of his curses had taken effect. But finding that she out-
lived one curse, she felt encouraged to urge her husband,
when he came home in the evening,§ to be more prompt in
effecting the dismissal of Matthias; `and on the following
morning sheproposed that he should leave her up stairs,
and say to Matthias distinctly, that he should have no more
opportunity of preaching to her, and insist upon his leaving
that day. This was done, and he promised to go, but re-

nested that the family might dine together once inore.--
gh. Folger took Mrs. Fo|ger's breakfast upto her room,
and she drank freely of the coffee. She then asked to have
her little daughter, about six years old, sent up to her.-
When the child came up stairs, she said, '
Mother, Mr. Mat-
thias said, that was not the Lord's table they ate at this
morning, but the devil's,' and that Mr. Matthias did not eat
any breakfast. The child likewise said, that the coffee was
not good, and that she could not drink it.'
"
Mr. Folger being much occupied that morning, in de-
'livcring the articles of fumiture belonging to the estate of
Mr. Pierson, which was to be sold at auction, sent for Mrs.
Folger, as he needed her assistance.1' Meeting her little son,
about ten years of age, as she descended the stairs, he said
to her, '
Mother, the coffee was so bad this morning Icould
hardly drink it.'1 She merely replied to him, being busy,
'Why did you drink it then 7' and the circumstance
escaped her mind, as did the other complaint from the little
irl.

Matthias seized an
opportunity, while Mr. Folger was
in another part of the house delivt-ring furniture, to renew
his threats upon Mrs, Folger.§ He was then seated in the
kitchen, preaching to Catherine and the coloured woman.
Mrs. Folger was
engaged down stairs, and continued to be
until dinner vas
ready. Matthias did not eat any dinner,
but wept while the rest were
eating-intending, perhaps,
.to try the force of tears, for he did shed real tears. Mrs.

fast. The child might or might not have observed that the coR'ee
was bad z
there was no evidence of this on the late trial.
1 The_s1ngular conversation about the relative physical powers
of Matthias and Mr. B. Folger probably took place at this time.
2 This may or may not be true. It was not brought forward at
the late trial, where no defence was otfered, and Mr. Folger uw-
victed of a malicious libel in relation to this coffee.
S Mrs. Folger promised not to unite with Mr. Folger till th
holy child was born.
HAIRATIYI or rsnssu. 99
'Fblger`did not observe the coloured woman at that time,
but has at other times, that she did not eat when Matthias
abstained. Mrs. Folger retired to her room, after dinner,
with her children. It rained that afternoon; and Matthias
pleaded that circumstance as an excuse to Mr. Folger that
he did not depart. At su
pper-time Matthias seated himself
at the table, but did not partake. He remarked, that he
began to realize his situation, and commenced pronouncing
woes upon those who had caused it. Mr. Folger forbade
his preaching any more to his family, and he was silenced
for the time,
`
,
_
"
Mr. Folger asked him if he should send his sons to
their mother in Albany. Matthias replied, "he would as
soon send them to hell!" but, in the same breath, said, "he
wished he would." On a second reflection, however, it
seemed to be his design to kee house somewhere in New
York. I-Ie packed up their cllothes with his, and said, he
should take them with him. Mr. Folger soon after this re-
oollected, that he had promised their mother, that if they
were to leave his family, he would send them to her. Ho
accordingly told Matthias of it, and that it must be done :.
and in three days, after having things properly prepared,
Mr. Folger committed them to the care of the captain of, a
steamboat, paid their expenses to Albany, and sent them
home.
"Immediately after supper, on the last night Matthias
was in the house, he went to bed. Mr. Folger had an er--
rand out on business, ,and went to attend to it. Mrs. Folger,
with Catherine, retired to her room; but having occasion
to go to the kitchen alter a while, Matthias was found there
with the coloured woman. Catherine accompanied Mrs.
Folger to the kitchen; whereupon Matthias and the col-
oured woman began to ersuade her to join them in keep-
ing house: and they no dloubt would have induced Cathe-
rine to go with them, but for the advice of Mr. and Mrs.
Folger.
»
'°
During that night Mrs. Folger was quite unwell, and
'did'not sleep. She1>'bseryed't~hat'Mr. Folgerwas very rest-
less, and groaned in his sleep. The children, who were in
IM ~
lnnnrvn or un|1.|.a.
_the next room with Catherine, were restless and wakeful,
and rather wild and light-headed. Catherine was also rest-
less, and groaned in her sleep!
"
Mrs. Folger then remembered the children's complaint
about the coffee, and Matthias not eating when they did_'|*
In consequence of this, she told Catherine in the mornin
to get brcaklhst separately for us; to be sure
they washed
every thing to be used, and not to use
any of the provisions
lhen in the house. Catherine then mentioned to Mrs. Fol-
ger, that she had observed the cofi`ee.was had the mornin
before, had a
strange taste, and had something white in it
-that she had asked the coloured woman the cause of it,
who had replied, that she could not expect to have
§ood
¢oil`ee, or any blessing, while her Father was oH`en ed.§
This morning, Mr. Folger went down, at Mrs. Folger's re-
quest, to see that her instructions were obeyed. Mr. Fol-
ger and family took breakfast in the parlour: Matthias, the
eoloured woman, and Matthias' sons, below stairs.
"Alter breakfast. Mr. Folger told Matthias he`must be
off immediately-that he should not leave the house until
he had gone-that as for his sons,
they should be sent to
their mother. Matthias undertook again to display some
of his lofty movements, and made some objections; but the
lpell was broken, and his day had assed. He was soon
silenced, n n being assured, that ii)there ~was
any farther
trouble witliohim, Mr. Folger would step to the police-oflice
and get assistance. He consumed all the time he could in
getting his clothes together, and asking for many articles,

F None of this evidence was produced on the late trial.
vt-Mr. Folger endeavoured to repair the injury of the libel by
charging Catherine as the author, and
saying that she was an in-
ifrnal liar.
(This came out on the late trial, in Mr. Whiting's evi-
ence.

Which were denied him. He exercised considerable inge-
nuity to obtain them; but his true character was under-
stood, and his motions were watched. He at last obtained
a cartman, sent away his baggage, and departed himself
about noon, on the \8th or 19th of September.
'
"
Mr. and Mrs. Folger went, the sanie day, in search of
a more suitable residence."
We ask, now, what authority this book of Mr. Stone's
can have, as illustrating
"
The Progress of Fanaticism,"
as Mr. Stone has it in his title-page, when it so
completely
garbles and obscures the facts?
In relation to the property of Mr. Pierson, we have al~
ready said, that much dissatisfaction exists amongst his re-
latives. He was
supposed to.be worth $80,000, by his own
representations; but Matthias, and some of his neighbours,
suppose he over~rated himself; as many others do. He did
give away large sums in his various charities, and in the
kingdom. We tknow Matthias' tailor's bills were sent to
him, and that his expenditures were extremel free; but
the household expenses in the kingdom, even though they
had a large family, could not be much, as all in that family
worked; even the Father and the Mother worked a little,
and living on a farm, in a plain way, each must have prof
duced nearly as much in value as what he consumed, ex-
ee t the' Prophet. The land speculation was decidedly good.
The machinery does not appear to have cost Mr. Pierson
much; nay, he possibly
gpined by it. His stock specula-
tion is alone doubtful, we ave no evidence on it. ~But the
greatest cause of dissatisfaction is the loss of Mr. Pierson's
accounts-and this indeed is a
mystery. Mr. Pierson was
a good accountant, had always kept his own affairs in or-
der; and when a firm with which he was connected was
once bankrupted, he it was who made up the accounts, to
the satisfaction of the parties concerned. From these facts,
and the habit of Mr. Pierson to
put to per even the trivial
transactions ofthe day, his family anduiriends believe that
° This going to seek a new residence is not very reconcilable
with the
sickngss
said to be occasioned by the cofee. .

hte, and partly from an
nnwillingnes to undertake it,
from in nature; we lnve, however. promised to give the
whole truth, and. therefore, we shall give the Bets as rela-
ted to us, luring reflections to our renders. After the sale
of gwds at Sing-Sing. belonging to Mr. Pierson, that gen~
tlem:|n's goods, property, and papers. were sought alier in
the house in Third street: the key ofthat part ofahnreau_
supposed to contain Mr. Pierson's papers, was
lost; but
Hr. F'olger, about than time, was examining papers for
two
days; and Isabella, when looking after sheets and
other linen of Mr. Pierson's to be given up for sale, enter~
ed the room in which the bureau was, and observing;
change in its appearance which arrested her attention, and
not knowing what was in it, for though she had heard
some noise abouta key and papers, she did not
identify
them with this bureau; indeed, a
person who neither reads
or writes, and who has no
property, takes very little inter-
est in papers: this bureau having attracted her attention,
while in search for linen. she put her hand on the top of it
and it came
open,-the drawer, as she expresses herself;
dropped out; shc then discovered that this piece of fumi-
ture contained small compartments, and different papers
tied u , but these did not attract her attention, and nothing
like slieets or linen appearing, she would have shut this
drawer up immediately, had not an object of curiosity ar-
rested her; this was a small round magnifying or
shaving-
glasl, and taking this glass up, to her astonishment, she
discovered that it enlarged her face enormously; forgetting
all other subjects, and not supposing she had done any
thing wrong, she told Catherine of this curiosity, stating
where she had seen it; and Catherine next took it to Mr.
B. Folger, then in another room. Mrs. Folger, who was
present. appeared surprised at the exposure; but Mr. Fol-
xAan_i"r1'z or IBABBLLK. 103
ger manifested no
surprise, either at the object, or at Cath-
erine's having it; and this should be remembered, for it
supposes that Mr. B. Folger did not know that it was
taken from that drawer, or else that that act was of rio conse~
quence. Mrs. B. Folger, however, discovered an im
pprtance
in this transaction, and immediately informed
atthias that Isabella had opened a drawer of Mr. Pier-
son's, and she brought him down stairs to scold Isabella,
she coming side by side with Matthias, and leaning
on him, and in the scolding pa,rt supplying him with
words, and making a case the worse for her interference;
it was this quality in Mrs. B. Folger which chiefly annoy-
ed Isabella. Matthias scolded Isabella severe] for med-
dling with the drawer. Isabella defended hersellyby stating
that she was looking for sheets. Mrs. Folger remarked,
"
that any one that would open a drawer would do any
thing else." Isabella denied opening it, declaring that she
laid her hand on it, and the drawer came open; that it was
neither latched nor locked. The reflections of Mrs. Folger
caused Isabella to express a determination to leave the
kingdom; fbr this, it appears, Mrs. Folger nor Matthias
was prepared, and Mrs. Folger coming into the kitchen
again, entered into explanations, and stated that she did not
mean to say that Isabella had designedly broken open the
drawer, but that, being very strong, she had broken the
lock or ketch undesignedly, and thus o ened the drawer
while handling the bureau. Isabella replied,emphatically,
"
No, there was no ketch or lock broken, the drawer came
open simply in touching it." All this while Isabella had
attached no importance to the transaction; but Mrs. B
Folger now remarked, softening her voice to a low tone,
that "if it were known that the drawer was opened, Mr.
Folger would be ruined." She further remarked, "that if
Hr. Bnmham, (the agent of Mr. Pierson's relatives,) had
como, he would have put in the key and opened it, and he
never would have known that it had been opened." (This
was said in reply to some other remark of Isabella.) 'I'o

there! perceiving for the first time, what she thought the
cause of Mrs. Folger's anxiety. Mrs. Folger replied, No.
Isabella afterward resided about ten days in the house with
Mr. Burnham, and stated to him all the transactions which
we have recorded. We draw no conclusions from these
facts relative to this drawer and quarrel; but we think it
due to Mr. Folger to state, that he did not mix up with the
quarrel, or show any anxiety about it. Nor do we ascribe
to Mrs. Folger, individually, any improper connexion with
this transaction. f

duccintc of a supposed holy son, and some
curiosity neces~
lrily exists in relation to this subject. In the anonymous
and distorted notice of these transactions, it was stated that
his expected son being a
daughter, convinced Mrs. Folger
of her error; instead of which, the child was not born when
die parties separated in bad feeling, as we related in the-
lut chapter.
' `
We have noticed the altered manners of Mrs. B. Folger
towards Matthias. His `ealousy and distrust of her, ap-
parently estranged her afllections from him; but no sudden
discovery took place, which altered her views. It was evi-
dent that lon before this. the divine and sublime character
of Matthias had been diferently estimated in the kingdom,
especially by Mrs. B. Folger. Notwithstanding Matthias
was illiterate, s bad ami coarse speaker, apparently mad,
106 IARRATIYI or IIAIILLA-
vain in his person and ap rel, an_ enthusiast, with much
cunning ; yet when dressedrhe was of genteel demeanour,
he had read much, and mingled much philosophy with his
rel' ion and madness; and hilosophy prevailed towards
thellatter days. He preached)happiness on earth, not in the
sky, as the Scripture doctrine; and 'some of his measures
were calculated to effect that end. Religious worship,
prayers. and singing, were nearl extinct in the kingdom,
while his maxims, referring chiefly to this life, were firmly
established; and his followers in the kingdom, includin
Mrs. Folger, continued attached to him, less from his spirituai
than his mundane qualities. He was extremel cleanl ,
and a lover of order; and with his authority, the whole
house partook of these qualities. He was
temperate, with-
out being abstemious, except in wine and spirits, of which
he took none. We have no evidence of his being inconstant
to Mrs. Folger; and his wife considered him a chaste man,
while she knew him; she does not believe that he formed
any connexion with any other female, while living with her
in a state of matrimony. And he informed us, that he had
no matrimonial union with his wife, since he first declared
himself a Jew, and allowed his beard to
grow. His ,wife
then declared that she would not have a
Jew; and this
formed part of his excuse to us for his union with Mrs. Fol-
ger. We know too, that when he returned to Albany alter
the breaking up of the kingdom, that he did not sleep in his
wife's house, although he gave her a
large sum of
money,
and the care of nearly the whole for a short time. His
maxims-'and interpretations of Scripture were
peculiar and
original; at least to the party forming the kingdom, and as
they were
firmly believed in, his disciples, we believe, rather
gave him credit for great wisdom and penetration, than for
any divine character. Indeed we have now in our sses-
sion, a letter written by Mr. B. Folger to one of his reliallives,
in which he expresses himself as unhinged in his religious
opinions, towards the close of the kingdom, and without ex-
Etessing
a belief in Matthias. There was then, as we be-
eve, no sudden disbelief'of Matthias. He had gradually
ailiimed mother "character, without any formal resignation
tuna-rrv: or in BBLLA. |07
of his former. He was fond of his fine garments and long
fbeard for their own sakes, and Mrs. B. Folger was fond of
him for his personal qualities. But when she became the
object of his resentment, her love for a moment appeared
to turn to hatred. Before ever Matthias left the house,
something of this feeling was shown, but immediatel '
on
his departure, it assumed a most baneful course. 'If we
lookfor any deliberate plan or
design running in connected
links through the whole period of the kingdom, on the part
ofany one ofthe members, we shall perhaps be disappointed;
we believe that not one of them was
capable of such con-
sistency, unless it were Mr. Pierson in his better days; the
rest, including Matthias, evidently were inconsistent, and
changed their mind from time to time; and that, too, in some
eases most foolishly. Thus we have alread '
related that
Mr. B. Folger gave Matthias $500 in gold andsilver, on the
eve of his departure, when both he and his wife expressed
an
unfriendly feeling. This, too, \vas
deliberately done,
and Catherine and Isabella \vere called as
witnesses; Isabella,
too, was
paid $25. Now this calling of witnesses seems to
suppose a deliberate act, and a wish to prevent mistakes.
This gift of money was, too, accompanied with some curious
advice, as we before related. Matthias was advised to let
Isabella take charge of the gold, assuming that she and
Matthias \vould travel together; and Matthias was further
advised, when he arrived ut the end of his destination, to
ppt
the money in u
bedpost. At the same time, Mr. and
rs.
Folger \vere very particular in inquiring where Mat-
thias and Isabella were
going, and when, and by what C011-
veyances.
But at this time, neither of these persons could
tel, for they had made no definite arrangements; while
Catherine secretly advised Isabella not to go with Matthias,
and to get back her money, for that Matthias would be taken
up. Isabella had then confidence in Matthias, and knew
of no reason why he should be taken up; she therefore
treated this advice with contem t. Matthias and Isabella
left Mr. Folger's house in Third) street, on Thursday, l9th
of September, 1834, separately; without stating where they
were
going. Matthias, however, told Isabella she might
U
108 naaarrlvn or rs.nsx.r.a.
hear of him at Mr. Durando's, corner of Chamber and
Chatham streets, and Mr. Folger engaged to lake Matthiu'
sons to Albany. Isabella, on calling on Mr. Durando, only
learned that Matthias had left the city, without leaving any
directions. She then determined upon going immediately
to Albany, as she had promised Matthias that she would bo
there on Saturday, when his children were expected, and
explain the circumstances to his wife. For this purpose she
retumed to Third street house, to take her luggage, but do-
clined stating where she was going. Mrs. Folger, how
ever, and Catherine, kissed her, and wished her good-b ;
they were, too, making bedticks, as she supposed, for the
eountry; and at that time no
unfriendly feelings were rnanif
fested either towards her or Matthias; nor was either she
or Catherine ill from the effects of any awe, taken the day
previous, as in Mr. Stone's account; besides, Mrs. Folger
went out the same
day a house hunting; and no poisoned
coffee prevented this, or her kissing Isabella, as just related.
Isabella, afier calling on Mr. John Dumont on her jour-
ney, reached Albany by the Nimrod on
Saturday;
and found,
with some surprise, that Matthias had preceded er, and was
sitting in his wife's house. It appears, he had then given
his wife the money to take care of and had told her, that
"the kingdom must retire into the wilderness for a time."
Matthias went out soon after Isabella arrived, and the bo
presently
came in, not brought by Mr. Folger, but sent b;
im in 'a towboat. Scarcely had the boys arrived, when
one of them (John) exclaimed to his mother, "
Mother,'Mr.
B. Folger has got a
police officer -after father, for stealing
nnd robbing things ;" the other boy confirmed this, and on
the re-entry of Matthias, these statements were made to hin,
and he was
interrogated b his wife, to whom he explained
all the circumstances, and took no
precaution to escape.
Isabella not understanding the subject, returned on Monday
to Mr. J. Dumont, near
Hyde Park, with whom she form-
erly lived, perhaps for advice. On Tuesday, Matthias was
taken by two police.ofTicers, Smith and another; and Isa-
bella hearing of it, when the boat arrived, returned to Al-
bany to make inquiry. And of Mrs. Matthias she than
O
Num/i'rrvx or rs.nlr._r.A. 109
asked the previous character of Matthias, and Ending him
honest, she persuaded his wife to come to New York, where
the might together assist him. It appears that Mrs. B.
Foilger had advised the employment of
(as she said) Old
Hays, who she said would do his duty in this aH`air, but
that Mr. B. Folger had objected, because Mr. Hays knew
Matthias; and this apparently strange reason induced them
to employ two officers comparatively unskilful. Nor can
this strange transaction be explained, except by connecting
it with some others. 'I'here vas, about that time, diligent
inquiry concerning Mr. Pierson's property, a small sum
being only recovered; suspicion had been excited, and the
body of Mr. Pierson had been disinterred a few weeks after
his death, and the unlcarned surgeons employed on that oc-
casion, tended rather to increase, than allay suspicions.
The key of the bureau had been lost, and the accounts not
found; but the bureau opened. Mr. Folger, .as residing
with Mr. Pierson, and as being intimately engaged with
him in money transactions, and keeping his accounts, as
Matthias informed us, was
necessarily mixed up with these
affairs and suspicions. Now, whether designed or not, there
certainly' was the appearance of making Matthias and Isa-
bella the scapegoats in these transactions. It may not have
been so; but it does look, ns if Matthias and Isabella being
sent into the wilderness, were made to bear the suspicions
with them then existing; forthere vas no ground whatever
for charging Matthias with stealing. Nor was Mr. Folger
duped out ofthe 8500; it was a
deliberate act, after he had
ceased to be a believer in his divine character; and having
made the charge, he never
supported it. While rejecting
Hays because he knew Matthias, seems as if he did not
wish Matthias to be taken; nor can we conceive that he
did, as he had committed no legal offence; indeed, he and
Mrs. Folger had_no thought of his being taken, supposing
Matthias and Isabella had gone South. No sooner, how-
ever, vas Matthias taken,`and a trial almost certain, when
the charge must be sustained, than Mr. B. Folger circulated
the poison story, and declared that Isabella, in conjunction
with Matthias, had attempted to poison his family; and this
10
'
1
110 ruanuivn or rssasnu.
seems to have been an aller thought, to injure the character
of Isabella, as Mr. Western stated in court, to affect the tea-
timony she was
expected to give in favour of Matthias. For
when Mrs Folger and Catherine kissed her, and spoke
kindly the day alter the coffee was drank, and when they
were in good health, and Mrs. Folger was house-hunting ;
it is evident no thought of poison was entertained. And the
.groundlessness of this charge has since been determined by
a conviction of Mr. B. Folger for slander, and damages of
2525'paidtoIsabella:andinthiscase,too,nodefence 'paid to Isabella: and in this case, too, no defence
was offered, as if there was even no ground for such a sus~
picion. Whatever may have been the design of Mr. Fol-
ger in these measures, they produced a new chain of cir-
cumstances, and led to events which he had not calculated.
Matthias was now in custody, under a
charge of stealing
or
swindling, with a
report, circulated by Mr. Folger, that
,he and Isabella had poisoned his family. The consequence
of _these charges was, that the body of Mr. Pierson was
:again disinterrcd, and again examined by medical men;
some of whom were not much more learned than the form-
er, if we can
judge by their testimony in court, where they
-excited much laughter, by their assumptions and ignorance.
In the mean time Matthias was
brought up for examina-
tion; and he showed, clear enough, that the money had
-been given, to him; and shortly alter Mr. B. Folger pub-
licly_admitted this fact! But the presumption was, that he
had been duped; and public feeling, including those of the
magistrates, regarded all the villany on the
part of Mat-
thias; and he was committed for trial, for obtaining money
'under false pretences.
Inthe mean time Isabella went to Morristown, to fMr.
Pierson's friends, to justify herself; but was received with
suspicion: she went to her former friends, but was met, in
every direction, with the charge of poisoning Mr. Folger'|
family: yet no attempt was made to take her into custody.
~nor did she seek to
escape. She took, too, the very wise
precaution of getting written characters from all her former
eemployers, which we published in our first number: she
assisted also Matthias, necessarily, in vindicating herself
mmnrrrva or rsaanru.
'
III
.1 Mr. Hall had been employed by Mathias' wife; buf
he being absent when wanted at the trial, Mr. VVestem ac~
cldentally undertook the defence of Matthias: and after a
powerful appeal, by him, in sup rt of the claims of Mat--
thias to have a fair trial, his trialxivvas adjoumed.
A friend of Matthias' wife, a Mr. gRobinson, then sought'
a
lawyer, to undertake his case; and as Isabella was neces-
sarily chief witness, he took her with him to Mr. Wilson,
who spoke of Matthias as a beast : and as this mode ofspeak-
ing of him did not suggest the chance of an able lawyer in
his favour, Isabella advised trying some other. Mr. Rob-
inson then took her 'to Mr. Western, and that gentleman
patiently heard her whole story: and when she mentioned
having called on Mr. Vilson, he very liberally declared his
wish that she should call on' him again, offering to assist
Mr. Wilson, if he requested it, or become second counsel"
She did call again on Mr.VVilson, and told him of her hav-
ing seen Mr. Vestcm. Wilson acted with less liberality;
and peevishly asked, "
Vhy did you go to V'estern 'P' and
added, soothingly, "I am
going to act like a Christian."
Now it so
happens, that the name of Christian had been-
associated with every not of violence towards Isabella and
Matthias. Matthias called himselfa Jew; stating that Je-
sus was a Jew, and came to show men how to`become the
sons of God. He denounced several real corruptions in.-
the doctrines and practices of the common church, and ad-
vanced new and peculiar doctrines of his own, assuming nn
independent interpretation of Scripture. Those who re-
ceived these doctrines formed °'
the kingdom," the rest vere
called "
devils." Those who had violently sent Mr. Mills
to the Lunatic Asylum, and who hired brutal men in New
York to cut off Matthias' beard, did it in the name of`Chris-
tianity. And Mr. Mills, the brother ofthe friend of Mat-
thias, struck Isabella a violent blow on the neck, the swell-
ing of which even now troubles her: and this was done in
the name ofthe Lord I while some of themost distinguished
clergy and Christians assisted on that occasion. Matthias,
however, held' thatthe had` the truth, and all others were
called devils; and of these, in his estimation, the Chris-
f
1
112 ,
HARRATIVE or 1sAnnt.t..4.
tians (confounding all) were the worst part: and while he
distinguished his party as Jews, the others were called em-
phatically Christian Devils, by way ofcontempt; associa-
ting always the idea of the violence done him and his party
in the name of Christ. When, therefore, Mr. Wilson told
Isabella, that "
he was going to act like a Christian," she
received it with the prejudice she had imbibed from some
late acts, and from the instruction she had lately been under.
Besides, about this time, she suffered an act of gross injus-
tice from Mr. Latourette, ihr-merchant, in Pearl-street and
the Bowery, and a
very prominent Christian : for when ap-
pliéd to for a character, during the time hc knew her, in
common with others she had served, he I
refused il; al-
though he admitted to us, afterward, that she was exem-
lary--41 child of God, and eminently gifted and favoured
hy God, (she used to preach at camp meetings;) and in-
deed gave het' the very best character for morals, truth, in-
dustry, and intelligence. instead of giving her this cha-
racter, in reference to ber former conduct, when it would
have been of use to her, labonring under Folgt-r`s charge
of poisoning; he preached to her about leaving his church,
which he seemed to consider backsliding: yet she asked
for nothing that she had not a
perfect right to-she wanted
no favour?-she did not ask him to
presume ht-r pn-sent
goodness; but she simply asked a character, while in con-
nexion with his church, and occasionally in his service
and hnuse. Isabella, then, not liking the ofibr ol' Mr. iVil-
son, returned to Mr. Western, to confirm her testimony he-
fore given ; and he undertook the detbnce of Matthias, and
advised also the prosecution of Mr. B. Folger for slander,
as
tl; only means to establish her character, and make her
an e ecttve witness. _
On this suit being commenced, it is rentarkable that Mr.
B. Folger went immediatel to the parties through whom
he had circulated the slander, and contradicted his own
statements, offering to ive Isabella the very best character.
This came out in Mr. %Vhiting's evidence, in the case ofthe
late slander suit. We have seen also a letter from Mr.
Folger to'Mr. Whiting,` in which he admits the falseness of
, Nsaaxrzvn os rs,\nr:r.1./t. H31
zhecharge, but foolishly puts it off on Catherine's shoul--
ders. Indeed, Mr. Folger appears incapable of excusing
himself; without accusing some other person ; and this
weakness is a prominent feature of his character, and ex~
plains many foolish circumstances.
Matthias, at this time, lay in Bellevue; and while here,
a
singular scene occurred. Some friends of Mrs. Matthias
had advised her to seek a
divorce; and in order to do this,
to obtain some
money from Matthias, or an order to get it
for the remains of the $500 had been lodged in 'Pl bank. Mr-
B. Folger became acquainted with this movement ; perhaps
Mrs. Matthias had mentioned it to him, for the purpose of
exacting a
composition. She was a
silly woman, irequently
changed her plans, and apparently acted without much prin-»
ciple; for we know that she once contemplated offering tn»
procure the return of her daughter to Mr. B. Folger for a
sum of money, expecting to be able to induce her daugh-
ter's present husband (whose principles and moral standard?
are not highly estimated) to go to England. She then had,
perha , let him know her intention ; at least he did know
it, andiisontrived to accompany her and her friends tothe
prison, at the very time when she went to seek from Mat-
thias the means of obtaining a divorce, (nn order for mone ')
or a
part of the $500, which he received as a
gift from ll/fr.
Folger. As her friends, especially a Mr. Robinson, wish-
ed to shake off Mr. Folger from the company, at one time
a
complete chase took place, on the way to the prison. Mr.
Folger, however, contrived to go in with the party; and
when in the presence of Matthias, darted before the rest,
seized Matthias by the hand, and called him Father, and
begged instantly for a
private audience, when he and ,Mat-
thias retired into the cell. On the exit of Mr. Folger, Mrs.
Matthias entered, and then learned that Matthias knew her
purpose; and smiling at her simplicity, he declined giving
her an order for money for such a
purpose. Mrs. Matthias
gave us this anecdote. i
After a short time Matthias was again brought up for
trial, in the criminal court, New York; when no one ap~
peered against him, and Mr. Western ably pleaded for his.
I0'

discharge. But in the mean time, in consequence of this
charge, and that of poisoning, against Matthias, originating
only in the criminal* weakness of Mr. Folger, Pierson was
again disinterred, under all the excitement of strong preju-
dice; and though no definite signs of poison appeared in
his stomach or bowels, some unkmrwn appearances, and an
unknown substance found in the stomach, was sufficient
cause, in conjunction with the reports and charges raised
by Mr. Folger, to find a bill of indictment against Matthias;
and he was
_demanded of the authorities of New York, on
the capital charge of murder, and delivered over to take
his trial.
The trial was appointed at Bedford, West Chester, on
the 25th of November, 1834, .and the parties went down;
but at this time it was
put off by the sickness ofthe Judge.
It was then appointed to, come on at White Plains, and
several of the witnesses were examined by the Grand Jury.
On the part of the prosecution were Dr. Conder, Mr. Burn-
ham, and a
Mrs. Millspaw, who had formerly lived as house-
keeper to Mr. B. Folger, before the kingdom was set up
This woman gave one testimony, in regard to Mr. and Mrs.
Folger, on this occasion, but a
very different one to some
of our friends. We 'have not sought her evidence, or an
interview with her, because she knew but little about the
kin dom, and is least respected where best known, espe-
cially in the Greenwich Baptistchurch, to which she did
belong: and though she has confirmed some of our state-
ments, which she did know, we did not think her evidence
would addto the credibility or
respectability of the narra-
tive. On this occasion, Isabella also was examined before
the Grand Jury; but no trial took place, from the absence
of Mrs. B. Folger and Catherine, two witnewes who were
deemed essential. In the interval, it appears, the lioly child
had been born, with all the pains and circumstances which
usually accompany an
ordinary birth; and just at this time
both the child (a
Ikmale)
and the mother were
extremely
ill with the, smal -pox. (This child was alive and well a
few weeks since,and out nt nurse

sel for Matthias. declared himself ready, and showed the

injury that would be sustained by his client if the trial was
not proceeded in. The trial was, however, again put off;
and, for the sake ofjustice, it was well it was, for a circum-
stance arose from this delay that much served to confirm, if
not to develo , facts.
Mrs. B. Fdiger, who had taken again her husband to her
favour and bed, had become a little jealous of Catherine. to
whom he had formally been united several times. This
jealous' was shown within a few weeks after the breaking
np of the kingdom, and did not diminish; while the re-
newed acquaintance with Mrs. Millspaw, and the supposed
services she had rendered Mrs. Folger, induced that lady to
dispense with the services of Catherine, and she and her
children became in want. In these circumstances she ap-
plied to Isabella; and in conversation told her all that took
place in the family (no longer kingdom) 'after the departure
of Matthias; and mentioned the contrivance to take, or to
pretend to take Matthias, in .relation to the inquiries about
Hr. Pierson's property; and mentioned the nrlum visit of
Mr. Latourette to Mr. and Mrs. B. Folger. (these persons
had previously been to him to confess and repent, as before
rela.ted,) and 'showed _that Mr. Latourette exhorted them to
some back to the Lord; and Catherine then made some
very sarcastic remarks on the ability of
_Mrs. B.
Folges to
cover over what
fault she wished, and ingemouslyto 1m-
plxcate others; observing,
"
You know how she can smooth
it so." This occurred just after Christmas, 1834.
Isabella, who at this time had obtained the confidence of
some of her fortner friends, by her direct and open conduct,
in relation to the charges brought against her, was now in
a comfortable situation with Mrs. Whiting, Canal-street,
with whom she had formerly lived: she had indeed very
little money, but this little she divided with Catherine,
whose children were then in want; and, with admirable
tact, took her to Mr. Western, the lawyer: here Catherine
confirmed the whole of lsabella's story. Mr. VVestern saw
her twice after this, once in the presence of Isabella and
once alone; when sheconiirmed her former statements,
even in relation to herself and Mr. B. Folger. Mr. Ves-
116 Nana/rrrvs or rsannhu. ,
'
tern indeed had told her, that in case she remained faithful,
and told nothing but the truth, he would not expose her, if
possible; but she did not keep her part ofthe bargain; Mr.
Western, however, has assured us, that he is satisfied of
the truth of Isabella's narrative, and she onl confirmed it.
On this occasion, too, Catherine informed' Isabella, that
"
all this blessed winter Mrs. B. Folger has been writing
against you and Matthias :" she added, that "
she will over-
come you, and Matthias will be hung; and all the Chris-
tians have been helping her." Now, of course, Catherine
did not mean the great body ofthe respectable community
under that name, but only a. tow, like Mr. Stone and the
Rev. Mr. Somers, an amiable sort of man, who might wish
to restore them to the church and their ancient faith, as Mr.
Latourette did; and Mr. Stone and the Rev. Mr. Somers
might see the propriety of covering up the iniquities 'of the
kingdom, although such a
design is rarely effected by a
publication.
When Isabella was thus informed, that a formidable book
was coming out against her and Matthias, by Mrs. Folger,
aided by all the Christians, she exclaimed, with much en-
ergy, (for she is really very energetic and not very timid,)
"
1 have got the truth, and I know it, and 1 will crush them
with the lruth." We have no doubt that Isabella was very
angry on this occasion, and perhaps expressed some bitter
wishes under such feelings; but Mr. Stone has published
rather a perversion of thc above expression. by leaving out
-the little word truth : so that it stands like an
unprovoked,
vindictive expression, and desire to crush her opponents by
any means. It is, however, not to gratify any vindictive
feelings that we defend her; ve
know nothing of Mr. and
Mrs. Folger and Mr. Stone, _but what they have
brought
forward by their very injudicious book. We have defen ed
Isabella, because we know she has the tru-th: we have
never detected her in 'a single exaggeration, nor has Mr._
Westemj and we think the follies of the kingdom ought
to be exposed, as arising out of fanaticism, or originating in
the dictates of feelings supposed to be divine, and which
really operate extensively. _

The account given by Mr. Stone of this conversation is
hom the narrative of Mrs. Folger, page 221 ; and charges
Isabella of boasting to Catherine, of telling lies; and con-
cludes by saying, that "she would crush Mrs. Folger."-
Of course the account is taken from Catherine, for nobody
else knew of this discourse. We have also given the above
remarks on her authority, but we give them no, more credit
than what appears natural and reasonable: from what fol-
lows, and other circumstances, she is not to he depended
on, and therefore we have not sought her out, for the sake
of any independent inlhrtnaition, though, as confirming the
statements of Isahellatto Mr. Western, her evidence was of
importance, especially :ts she could not tell what ,isabelta
had previously said to that lawyer; for lsabella's testi-
mony would_tul<c up several hours, and, as not reading or
writing, she would take no notes of what she had said,-
Catherine's confirmation of all the important facts in Isa-
bella's narrative, in the possession of Mr. Vestern, is then
important while evidence, which the public so much seek
alter: and yet, had Catherine told us this nnrmtivv, un-
supported by other testimony, we would not have published
I, for she wants both firmness and sincerity: but when she
.related what she had seen and heard, to Mr. ldfestern, and
gave the some narrative which Isabella had dont-, shecould
not have invented it, for thc- reason before given. Her tes-
timony, we think, is good for nothing, but as
confirming"
lsnbella's, and as far as consistent with the nature ofthings:
for Catherine returned, alter some time, to Isabella, (Still at
Hrs. Whiting's,) and regretted that she had been to Mr.
Western; she observed, "I um sorry I said to Western
that I had Ben." The fact `is, she had become again on
friendly terms with Mrs.~B. Folger.
i
The trial was again coming on. Mr. and Mrs. Folger
did not know that Catherine had given her evidence to Mr.
Western, and perhaps they will receive the first intimation
of it in _this book. Mrs. Folger was
expected to
give
her
evidence, and Catherine was perhaps tampered wit to sup-
rt that evidence. This, however, is only a conclusion

ally supporting Mrs. B. Folger's evidence at the trial; but
more especiall from the fact, that Mr. B. Folger frequently
sent for Isabella before the trial, and was extremely anxious
to suppress her information. We have now a letter in our
possession, from Mr. Folger, sent to Mr. Whiting, with'
whom Isabella then lived, expressing a
strong wish to see
her, and ask about some few things. Mr. B. Folger also
informed Mr. Whiting, that "the public began to believe
what Isabella said." Catherine, too, told Isabella, that Mr.
and Mrs. Folger wanted Isabella to join them against Mat~
thias: Isabella, hovever, prudently resolved not to see either
of them. Catherine had less firmness; and had the defence
of Matthias been gone into, she' must have been confronted
with her own
evidence; yet she probably only suffered
herself to be persuaded.
~
~
The trial at length took place at White Plains, on the
l7th of April, 1835, before Judge Ruggles and others;
when Mrs. B. Folger and Catherine appeared arm in arm.
The detail has been already given in the daily journals;
but as we think the facts here related will become a matter
of importance, from their peculiar character, we shall give
a few particulars.
Matthias, in the very commencement of the trial, while
the clerk was
calling the jury, rose, in spite ofthe remon-
strance of the judge, and addressed the cou-rt in the follow-
ing language; which is characteristic of the man and his
style. and therefore we
give it, as a
good illustration of both.
In reply to _the judge's reproof Matthias exclaimed,-"I
speak in reference to the proceedings of the grand jury-
that is a secret institution-andI here roclnim. that all
secret societies are dissolved-are dissol]ved-dissolved-
and were live ears ago! They were a curse! they have
thc curse of Almighty God upon them, and were dissolved
five years ago! I say, they are dissolved!" This was
uttered with great violence, and Matthias has a
powerful
voice. The 'courtwas utterly astonished at this proceeding;
and thinking it might proceed from insanity, decided upon
'calling an official inquestt and attera proper examination
of'several medical men and others, the jury returned averl
unnnarrva or 1sAnsr.r.A. 119
fllti that "
Robert Matthews, otherwise called Matthias, V188
not insane." Ile was then held responsible for interrupt-
ing the court, and awarded thirty days' imprisonment ; and
his trial for the murder of Mr. Pierson proceeded, on
Friday
the 18th of April, 1835, The district attorney, Mr. W.
Nelson, assisted by Mr. H. R. Storrs, of New York, and
by`Mr. Voris, of Sing-Sing, acted for the prosecution. Mr.
M. Western, assisted by Mr. N. Hall, of New York, and
Mr. Mitchel, of White Plains, defended Matthias.
In support of the prosecution, Jesse Bishop, a
neighbour,
at Sing-Sing, proved the control of Matthias in the estalr
lishmentfand gave an acknowledged fair statement.
Moses Cherry, a Sexton, at Morristown, proved the ex-
humation of Mr. Pierson ten days after his burial, and also
five or six weeks before the trial. Dr. Condit had carried
away the stomach, and found something white in it, in
quantity about eight or ten grains. He sent the contents
of the stomach to Dr.'1'orry, of New York, to be examined.
On Manch 2lst, 1835, the body was
again disinterred, and
then the gullet (msophagus) and intestines were carried
away. ,How the looked was technically described, and
an inference also drawn, that the various appearances were
theeffect of some poison. The examinations were made in
the presence of Doctors Canfield, Johns, and the two Con-
dits. Mr. Stone says, Dr. Condit is reported to have said,
that they were unanimously of opinion, that the death of
Mr. Pierson was not the result of natural causes. The two
Doctor Condits only were examined; and their evidence
afforded Mr. Western a tine display, in his able cross-er
amination; in vhicb he very clearly showed the absurdity
of learned physicians resolving that a
body had been poi-
soned, without stating by what, and how; and stating that
the death was unnatural, without showing in what.
The district attorney then admitted the evidence ot' Dr.
Torry, to whom the stomach was sent, without examining
him: his evidence showed that he had examined the stom-
ach, and had discovered no
poison.
Mrs. B. Folger gave the history of Matthias, and of the
death of Mr. Pierson; and showed that Matthias, like some

of the`European clergy, claimed the best of the property,
as first-fruits, and governed in the house: she mentioned
also the blackberry story. already considered. Catherine
also went-through the doctrines and practices of Matthias,
in support of what Mrs. Folger had stated; and the district
attorney brought proofs that the property at Mount Zion
had been made over to Matthias.
On the close of the evidence in support of the prosecu-
tion, Mr. Western moved the discharge of the prisoner,
without going into the defence, upon the ground that no
evidence had been produced to convict him; and in thil
the court acquiesccd, and instructed the jury, "that there
was no evidence showing that the death of Mr. Pierson
had been produced by poison, or
culpable neglect, or ill
treatment, and conse
uently advised an acquittal." The
jury thereupon immediately returned a verdict of acquittal.
Thus no defence was gone into, and the circumstances of
the kingdom not exposed. Isabella was
grievously disap
pointed in not giving her unsophisticated narrative in the
court.
The decision of the court was
evidently influenced by
the nature ofthis evidence, of which they had a
knowledge
and sought to suppress it, and the fimrness of Mr. Western.
One of the jury has since informed us, that he wished to
find Matthias guilty. The court was
evidently prejudiced
against him, and the public feeling also. There was, too,
a strong sympathy for Mr. and Mrs. Folger, who were re
garded as unfortunate dupes. From these feelings on the
part of the court, jury, and the people, and the general im-
pression
that Matthias had the property of Mr. Pierson, had
e had a less able counsel, or could Isabella have been de~
terred from giving the truth, if wanted, Matthias might
have been condemned. Mr. Western, expecting the result
which took place, from an
understanding between him, the
court, and the district attorney, abstained, too, from draw-
ing the facts of the narrative from Mrs. B. Folger or Ca.th~
urine, in cross-examination: and yet, lawyer-like, he and
the judge together, did enough to satisfv us of the leadi
fact, and that they knew the Connexion of Matthias

Mrs. B. Folger; for from this trial we drew that conclu-
sion, and published it.
The vindictive character ofthe court, the spirit of the
people, and that of the district attorney, suggested the trial
of Matthias, immediately on the close of the former trial,
for an assault on his daughter, before referred to, and nc-
knowledged to be merely fatherly chastisemcnt, and not
given in anger; but she was then a married woman, and
his conduct was neither proper nor legal: it was, however,
not a subject for prosecution, especially as the daughter did
not desire any such revenge: as a proof of which Mr.Wes-
tern read the following note in court from her:-
"
I
hereby acknowledge that I have received full and
"
ample satisfaction for the assault and battery in this case,
"
for which the defendant is indicted; and I respectfully pray
"
the court to enter a nolle prosequi therein accordingly.
"

"
W/tile Plains, April 18th, l835."
The court, however, vindictively resolved upon punish-
ing Matthias, and therefore proceeded with this trial. The
assault was proved, and Matthias convicted, under such an
excitement; and a court of law was thus disgraced by tum-
ing out of its ordinary course to punish a man, whom they
had tried in vain to convict of a
capital crime.
Matthias made rather an
affecting appeal to the court
upon this conviction, which he properly styled a
persecu-
tion; but the court sentenced him to three months' impris-
onment, besides the thirty days for contempt of court.
We do not mean to say that Matthias might not have-
deserved this quantity, or
any other quantity of punishment,
and we know, too, that there are a
great many pretenders
to the knowledge of the will ofGod, who deceive the people
and deserve the lash; but we must deprecate the adminis-
tration ofthe laws under the influence of passion. for then
it ceases to be the administration ofjustice,
Matthias went to prison, and Mr. Stone published his
book during his imprisonment. When he came out of
prison he called on us, being informed that we were writing

'whnh nm through the book; especlall as we have shown, or rather, ll lr

on the subject, and he confirmed the chief points in the nar-
rative. 'I'hus we
get this narrative confirmed by the lead-
`ing members of the kingdom-forming a
perfect white
evidence.
Matthias has since gone West; and is, we believe, now
wondering about the country, preaching, and living on the
hospitality of his hearers; his temperate habits enabling
him to live on a little when fortune lrowns. .
Mr. and Mrs. B. Folger are
living comfortably together
in a handsome house at Sing-Sing. Mr. Mills is married,
lives in great style, and is no longer a des onding Chris-
Qian: his connexion with Mr. Pierson an Matthias has
decidedly benefited him. Isabella is getting an honest
-living by work, and respected, for her services and integ-
rity, by her former employers. Mr. Stone is repenting his

CONCLUSION.
"
HAD he been in the same atmosphere#-"said a medicuit'
man to us, in relation to a
pious person,
"
he would have
been one of the rty;" the same remark applies to thou-~
sands, and in reigience to other countries, and to past ami
future ears, under every religionpand every form of re-
ligion, the remark may be applied tomillions; for in every
aommunity there is a class prepared to run such u course,
ii' circumstances conduce; and we are all, more or less, the
beings of circumstances.
'
We have shown that Matthias did not contemplate the-
seduction of Mrs. B. Folger, till tempted to this act; ami
we think there are very few men who would have resisfed.
such an
application: we subscribe to the
position
of Lani
Byron, that "there areert great many Potip er's wives, andt-
but few Josephs." Matthias too, we think mad,.from the
appearance of the eye, and extravagance of conduct, when,
no interestexi design was
apparent; we think him too, origi-
nally sincere in his piety and rinciples; but we think
also, thut he is cunning, and, in the progress of his career,
that his sincerity declined, and his design amplified; yet
the position which he takes is so near that which many
clergymcn take, that the District Attorney at once admitiei
that he could not disprove it, however ridiculous it~msl|>
admit that he had rt Divine Revelation, and could best in~
terpret the Scriptures: besides, Mr. Pierson took precisely,-
the same ground.
Mrs. B. Folger is no doubt a woman of a
very warm.
constitution, and if this was not exhibited in youth, the'm~
strsints of education, and a religious brin
`
g up, and ls*
religious connexions, will explain it: we didnnot think ea-

under favourable circumstances: when she received Mah
thias into her house, as a person possessing divine favour,
with new doctrines and new
interpretations of Scripture,
she was
placed in peculiar circumstances; the affection
generally shown b women towards their religious teachers,
betrays their weahness,-and we believe there is not a
popular clergyman but could triumph over a number of
his devotees, could he be base enough to
apply the arts of
seduction. Mrs. Folger, warm in constitution, absent from
her husband, and present with Matthias, who, from his
character, enjoyed every opportunity, was
daily approach-
ing an important crisis: her previous opinions about
matched spirits, and his previous opinions about marriages,
would easily mislead a veak woman, under the influence
of strong passions. We- are not then surprised, that in the
absence of Mr. Folger, that Mrs. Folger, should think,
dream, and have visions about Matthias; other females,
similarly constituted and situated, vould have done so too:
and it was unfortunate that her religious belief admitted of
communicating these thoughts and feelings to Matthias, as
emanating from divinity. We think it possible that these
feelings, natural in such circumstances, should- be mistaken
for divine communications, for even the Scripture will ad~
mit of a similar interpretation in the cases of Sarah, Eli-
zabeth, and Mary. That Mrs. Folger should have under~
taken to induce her husband to give her up to Matthias, is,
we believe, the most extraordinary circumstance in the
narrative; ve do not pretend to explain it; it is altogether
out of character with a weak woman, and is rather a trait
of an extraordinary being, who bounds over ordinary rules
and customs in society, and takes a
peculiar stand, not ap~
plicable to other mortals: yet this extraordinary character
we cannot accord to Mrs. B. Folger, and, therefore, we
must seek an
explanation in the joint characters of Mr.
and Mrs. Folger, Matthias, and Mr. Pierson, which in a
wonderful way conduced to this most extraordinary fact.
Her sincere piety is not disputed previous to her acquaint-
ance with Matthias; and the
probability is, that she was

alloy. Her failing was a love of distinction, without supe-
rior abilities: superior piety, and the assumption of the
character of Mother, was within the compass of ordinary
capacity; just as a man vho cannot be a
poet, a statesman,
an orator, or a
philosopher, may excel in the knowledge
of horses.
Mr. B. Folger can best be explained by his deficiencies;
he is marked by his vant of character; Nature has given
him a handsome face, a
good temper, a kind heart, and he
has added a
great suavity of manners, and extreme polite-
ness: but here nature has lelt him, and art, or education,
has not supplied the deficiencies--he is, more than any
other of the pany, the being of circumstances, without reso-
lution or sound principles: and while yielding to influence
effecting an under- plot, cunning but simple. _
Mr. Pierson is a
complete character; a man of strong;
mind, considerable information and experience of men and
things; extremely conscientious, and a firm believer in the
Bible; with strong passions, but under the control of rea~
son when in health. He adopted the opinion that God
would give him the true interpretation of Scripture, as an
answer to prayer. His prayers were fervent; and having
faith, he received the various impressions on his mind as
the will of God communicated to him. He discovered some
errors in Christian practice, and this conhrmed him in his
belief that his impressions were from God, and true. In the
vividness of his imagination, he thought that God spoke to
him: but this was not peculiar to him. Isabella, when a
mere girl, a slave, and totally ignorant, had the same im-
pressions; she used to talk to God, and supposed that God
talked to her: thousands of people have the same
impres-
sions. The peculiarities of Mr. Pierson were not the freaks
of a
madman; the were
systematic, and arose from what
he thought to be the will of God, as revealed in Scripture,
or`to him, in answer to prayer: and these opinions he vould
well defend, upon the acknowledged principles of answer
to prayer, and the true interpretation ol' Scripture. Il' Mr
Pierson was insane, there are thousands at this moment
affected with the same kind of madness, if not to the same
l l'

degree; these, in the circumstances of Mr. Pierson, would
do as he did.
Isabella-hers is a
peculiar and marked character. Na-
ture has furnished her, not with a beautiful, but with a
strong body and _mind. Born a slave in this state, and
brought up in ignorance on a farm, her early religious im-
pressions were
extremely gross; and her supposed commu-
nications with God, like those ofJacob, were a sort of bar-
gain. Her ideas were of this class-" Now, God, if you
will do so and so, then I will devote myself and doings to
your service." Her impressions were, that she was under
God's care, and that he, by her exertions, secured the free~
dom of her son, and led her in all her ways. As a Meth-
odist, at a later period, her strong body and mind had room
for exertion; she out-prayed and preached her compeers,
and received without doubting what was
taught. Her
acquaintance with Mr. Latourette, effected a
very easy
transition, it was
merely Methodism in the extreme, and
exactly suited her excited and active state of mind and
body. But when she went to Mr. Pierson, and found in
him a close student ofthe Bible, and ready to give an an-
swer to
every one, in a free but gentle manner; and when
she heard him advance other doctrines than those of Meth-
odists, her faith and confidence left her; and, perhaps for
the first time, she doubted that men could be sincerely in
the wrong. Mr. Pierson was a man
superior to any she
had met with, and she readily received his interpretations,
and became an
inquirer. Atierward, finding that Matthias
and Mr Pierson agreed, she readily became the disciple of
Matthias also, and received his interpretation of Scripture:
nor was her faith disturbed, till human passions mixed in
undue proportion with religious principles. Scripture, how-
ever, for a time, supplied an excuse, and Matthias was coin-
pared to David. What her fixed religious opinions now
are we know not. Her ancient faith is shaken ; she is not
a believer in the supernatural character of Matthias, but
still regards most of his interpretations as more rational,
and probably true, than that of any other teacher of religion;
she compares him too with the clergy, with a tact not to be
'
4 'eoNcLl1s|oN. F27
overcome, and draws a conclusion`in his favour. Hermo-
ral principles are the same as
formerly; she is still faithful,
attached to truth, industrious, and consequently independ-
ent; with a ready perception of right and wrong, and with
an
uprightness and energy of character not apparently very
common among the class from which she originated: and
these moral principles were awakened in favour of Matthias
when his life was
sought'by those who had nourished his
delusions.
The other members of the kingdom have been suffi-
ciently exhibited during the work, to mark their characters.
Thus Catherine, a weak woman, believing by accident, and
good or bad according to circumstances, is precisely what
thousands of women in her situation are, each of whom
would have played her part if similarly situated.
Of Mr. Mills suliicient has been said; his timely retreat
renders it doubtful whether he should now be regarded as
one of the kingdom or not. Of a number _of persons who
were at Sing-Sing for short periods, as visiters, and vho
manifested a similar creed, or
nearly so, but where circum-
stances prevented their complete amalgamation with the
party, we shall say nothing, because we do not know that
their abstract opinions affected their moral conduct; yet
these persons owe their safety chiefly to their distance from
the scenes of pollution.
Our object is now accomplished, that of laying before the
public a correct account of the source and effects of fanati-
cism, as illustrated by the followers of Matthias: we shall,
however, notice the fact, that while there were some pecu-
liar traits among the deluded in the kingdom, so
peculiar
as to meet with no parallel-as the voluntary surrender of
Mrs. Folger to Matthias, by her husband, himself a believ-
er, in good repute in the world, and attached to 'his wife-
and the abduction of Mrs. Laisdell, and peculiar and early
amalgamation with her, who was not then of the kingdom;
and her forcible detention atlerward; and her solemn union
with Mr.'B. Fol er, by the authority of her father, Matthias.
While, we say, guess transactions are uliar to this party,
and therefore deserve to be recordedehnd well authenti-

_
cated; yet we are compelled to
say;
that the 'machinery by
which these things, with others w ich have parallels, was
common to every individual who has setup Divine preten-
sions, or affected to establish a new sect; and this has not
been fully illustrated in the preceding pages, which were
intended more to show the effects of fanaticism on the dis-
ciples, than the means used. Matthias was mysterious; he
affected it in his appearance; he was so in language and con-
duct ; and, when most unintelligible, affected the most vis-
dom, and had it ascribed to him. _
When he told Mr. Fol-
ger, at an
early interview, on seeing a
part ofa sheet of
paper hanging from a drawer, '*
You see a
part only, I see
the wholez" and then applied it to their different states of
knowledge of the Divine will, this trait was
fully illus~
trated in him; and Mr. B. Folger became the dupe. But
Matthias affected miracle and prophecy: his prophecies
were indeed extreme] bold, and often fortunate. When
on the road to Bedford? a
ponderous piece of rock fell from
a
neighbouring cliff; and rolled near the carriage. Mat-
thias, then a
prisoner, begged permission to get out and
examine it; he was permitted: and having done so, with
much mystery in his look, he stuck his stick into the ground,
and solemnly exclaimed, "
By iny order the Judge will not
attend l" The Judge did not attend, and the trial was put
off to White Plains-thus claiming a miracle and myste-
riously announcing a fortunate prophecy at the same time.
To these means were added, his peculiar explanation of
Scripture-and these are
precisely the instruments which
have always been used by those who have established new
SBCIS.
Note. The story of the rock falling is given on the
authoritysof
Mr. Drake, who reported and published the trial of Matthias. a-
