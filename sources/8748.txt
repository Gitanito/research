  		          1118.      Jonathan H NDE     6/23/2007.    NDE 3120.    From the UK.      The operating room staff were rushing around me on the table while I watched from a corner of the ceiling above them on the other side of the room. I felt remarkably calm and just interested in the technical aspects of what they were doing. Interesting, and wondering why they were making such a fuss really. Then a bright white light grew brighter above me to the left, like a distant torch approaching and getting brighter. But it was square, not round. Drawn like iron filings to a weak magnet I seemed to move towards it, float is to imprecise an adjective, and realized that the light was coming from a square corridor that I was entering. No panic or fear, just curious. It wasn't cold either, no reason why it should be, but it was a neutral temperature. Moving up the slight gradient as if walking. Annoying silence all around, but a calm atmosphere. A voice, not one that I have ever recognized, but definitely male, then said 'It's not time yet, you can go back now.' I have been asking 'why?' and 'what for?' ever since!
  NDE during operation.   

      1117.      Petra NDE     6/23/2007.    Secondhand NDE 3114.    From Finland.      A voice said to me, 'See that young boy biking so happily there? He was run over by a truck'. The same male voice said to me 'See that lady over there', and he led me to a normal-appearing house - which didn't exist in the material world. It was located at Haaga central square. I was led in a corridor, which was flooded by an immense overflow of light - I cannot describe it better.  Suddenly there was an immensely brilliant light, which came off one of the ground floor apartments. There was a friendly but extremely authoritative male voice, which said I must tell everything. Suddenly I was in hospital, hanging off from the ceiling not unlike a bat. I fell on the bed in my body.  
  NDE due to heroin overdose.   

    1116.      Gina R NDE     6/18/2007.    NDE 3113.          All I remember is that I had gotten to the middle divider and stepped halfway up before I felt a force pull me into a direction leaving me in the dark momentarily. A car going forty-five mph struck my body and I could sense the projection occurring before it happened. I could protect myself throughout the accident while learning I could see myself being pulled to a safe place. I don't know where I went just before I got hit. That is why I feel an angel of some sort was also involved. While lying on the hot burning pavement some people tried to help me and all I could see was how my life flashed in front of me an image of me not walking and of dying in the hospital.
  NDE due to being struck by car.   

    1115.      Julie NDE     6/18/2007.    NDE 3112.          The next thing I remember is being on the ceiling looking down at my body. This did not frighten me; it was just 'okay'. I didn't think this was strange. My thoughts were light not deep. It was very peaceful everywhere. I felt very safe and secure. I could hear the birds outside. I was aware of everything around me. Yet, I was at the ceiling looking down at my body. I heard my grandfather come in the front door. I heard the door close. He called my name. When he saw me on the bed, he yelled my name. He began shaking me violently by my shoulders. He was crying and asking me what happened. I could feel his fear, but I had none.
  NDE due to injury from horse at age sixteen.   

    1114.      Connie V NDE     6/9/2007.    NDE 3108.          Sometime during the surgery I found myself on the ceiling in the corner of the room watching the doctor and his surgery room staff frantic about 'stop the bleeding,' and 'we are losing her,' statements. I was only five years old but I can still hear the words and see the intense bright light and the red blood on the little body below as I watched them from above. It was only a short time for my experience though I understand later that I was in surgery much longer than expected because of a 'few' complications. I didn't see Jesus, a higher power, relatives or go through a tunnel but I thought it was strange being up in the corner of the room at the ceiling.
  NDE at age five, fifty-six years ago, during tonsillectomy.   

    1113.      Douglas D NDE     6/9/2007.    NDE 3107.          I knew that this had to be the Book of Life that I had heard about as a youth and that if my name did not appear in it I would have to go to hell. This was very serious indeed but as I stood there, the book closed. That did not seem to be a very good sign and I resigned myself to the fact that I would have to go to hell because I had had plenty of opportunities to change but now it was too late. I knew that it wouldn't do any good to cry and beg but that I should at least take it like a man because there would be plenty of time to cry where I was about to go. Before any sort of trap door opened up to send me to hell I was taken to a second table just like the first one except this book was closed. I was somewhat confused as to what this second book was all about when suddenly it opened up and this scene was a repetition of the first scene. This entire second book made no sense at all as I had only heard of one book but it at least seemed to be a delay in what I already knew was about to happen. Then all of a sudden my name was found in the second book and I thought to myself 'great' I get to go to heaven.
  NDE associated with severe auto accident.   

    1112.      Teresa BH NDE     6/3/2007.    NDE 3100.          I was choking on a piece of candy I was given. It was early morning. Everyone had been asleep. I woke my family up choking. No one knew what to do. No one could help. I passed out on the floor in the kitchen, my family around me. Suddenly I was looking down at my body. I felt so peaceful. No fear just peace. Suddenly I was in my body again. I sat up coughed and the candy dislodged.
  NDE from choking.   

    1111.      Silvia NDE     6/3/2007.    NDE 3086.    From Argentina. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Carol.      The bus derailed and in the fall I banged my head. When I was able to open my eyes, I saw a very intense blue light. After I saw it far away, I started to pass through a tunnel. At the same time I was walking, I was remembering all the moments I lived with my brother. When I reached again the light, I went through it again and I saw my brother (he died four years ago). I hugged him and after crying for some minutes, he looked at me and told me that I had not to cry for his death. That he died because it was his time and I had to live without laments. That he was fine there and that he was always taking care of me from that place.
  Met her dead brother who said he was looking after her.   

    1110.      Augustin NDE     5/28/2007.    NDE 2872.    From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Eva and Carol.      It was pure energy, the force, the love, the life - I was already home... The sensations are indescribable as we are very limited in this life; over there, was an unknown world of new sensations opening up - of understanding of what, up until then, has not been understood by you, and you do love, my God, how you love... I felt as if someone approached to receive me, until I felt his presence directly in front of me. As if with a human form but without a physical body, everything was light and energy and love, and we communicated perfectly, not speaking but with thought and the mind. I started to be aware of more beings like him that surrounded us and received me. I could not be contained in my joy and contentment; everything was peace and harmony and I began fully to inhabit that space which was mine.
  NDE owing to allergic reaction to penicillin.   

    1109.      Cynthia R NDE     5/27/2007.    NDE 3097.          The Guide then took me to a room (no walls etc.). There were around eleven people walking around in a circle pacing as if they were following the first guy. He came up to what seemed to be a glass wall and said help me. So I tried to go there but the Guide said I was not allowed only he can save himself. Then we returned to the library. I heard Jesus speaking in the room to the side. I quickly ran to him but could not go through. I was very angry not to be allowed to be with Jesus. As I stood there, someone grabbed my wrist and when I turned my head, I saw a huge figure standing as if made up of golden energy. They don't talk, none of them did, but you can hear them in your head, you know what they are saying. I then knew the figure to be God. He was very loving yet very stern.
  Saw Mary, Joseph and the baby Jesus.   

    1108.      Barbara R NDE     5/27/2007.    NDE 3096.          I remember dreaming of a dark space and I saw people dressed in bright white and the feeling of I had a job to do. A job that was important in the grand design of things. A job that God gave me. But I had so many questions. I then felt like if someone was pulling me by the back of my shirt and I felt like I was falling and I heard my husband calling me, but he seemed so far away. Then I felt him smacking me telling me to wake up. When I opened my eyes I asked him why he woke me up, I was dreaming? He yelled at me and said that I was in the train station.
  NDE due to blood loss associated with miscarriage. Two NDEs in one day.   

    1107.      Sandra R NDE     5/27/2007.    NDE 3095.          He said, 'Come, take my hand.' I remember giving a half-hearted attempt at reaching him and realizing somehow that I couldn't feel anything from the waist down. He stood about eight feet from where I sat, and I knew I couldn't reach him. So I began to cry and I said, 'I can't reach you.' His voice got firmer as he in more of a demand than a request repeated, 'Take my hand!' This time, I tried as hard as I could to stretch my upper body enough to reach him, but I lost my balance, fell to the floor, and hit my face. Then I began to sob and I said, 'I can't! I can't reach you, you've got to help me. Please help me!' Then he said, very calmly, 'You've got to try. You must never stop trying.' The next thing I saw was a series of bright lights passing overhead as I regained consciousness and they were rushing me to x-ray.
  NDE in emergency room after accident. Interesting how experience, while relatively unpleasant, was clearly what she needed to live the rest of her life positively.   

    1106.      Anne V NDE     5/14/2007.    NDE 3079.          I felt like I was quickly going toward this long, very bright light and I saw a shadow of a man and I realized and thought, 'I am dying, I have to go back to my children.' I kept thinking my daughter's name. I woke up and had tears running down my face. The doctor and his assistants were acting very concerned. They told me that I gave them a scare.
  NDE due to dental procedure with nitrous oxide. Remarkably, the experience was shared the same day it happened.   

    1105.      Aurora N NDE     5/14/2007.    NDE 3077.          I looked left and right but all I could see was the fast speed that I was going through the tunnel then I saw some light at the end of the tunnel. Before I knew it, I was standing there in heaven. I could hear the angels sing in the most beautiful voice one can't imagine. Then I heard the voice of the Lord, like he was in front of the angels and I was trying to go through, but God said it was not my time. But I wanted to go in. Then God said turn and look. (It's a voice you obey.) So I turned and I could see all the doctors there working on me, like when you look out a window and see the full moon so close, I too saw myself. When I turned back to tell the Lord I wanted to stay. I woke-up back in my body; I woke crying, the nurse though I was crying because I had lost my baby. She told me they had lost me for a minute and was glad I was alright.
  NDE due to anesthesia following miscarriage.   

    1104.      Caroline S NDE     4/24/2004.    NDE 31279.    From the UK      During the c'sarian I dreamt that my father was just up ahead of me on a slight incline and he was exactly as I remembered him, I was trying to walk towards him but he turned around and waved me away and he said "no go back go back its not time yet" I can remember feeling slightly disappointed but the next thing I knew I was being woken up by my husband to tell me that the baby was alright. The next day a doctor came to see me and said that during the operation I had hemorrhaged very badly and that they had nearly lost me my husband confirmed this when he came to visit he said he was told to prepare for the worst.
  NDE during C'sarian delivery.  Also ADC dream described.   

    1103.      Lala NDE     3/20/2007.    NDE 21555.          It was almost 4 am. I woke up with a sharp pain in my head and chest area. I went to the bathroom. I got out of bed and I passed out for almost twenty seconds, if not more. I saw myself from the ceiling and my body was laying on the floor. Then I came back to my body and called 911. In the emergency room, I was laying on my bed, and I felt something touching my hair. I opened my eyes. It was my grandmother. She had passed away a long time ago. She told me to light five candles. When I closed my eyes again, she was gone. I even felt her weight on my bed, and when she left, I felt the bed move.
  NDE due to heart attack.   

    1102.      Theresa M NDE     5/3/2007.    NDE 3060.    Original in Spanish translated by Rio      I kept my eyes open, but there had been what I would describe as a separation of my spirit from my body because I saw my body from the ceiling of the room of the hospital. I saw, heard and felt such peace, an enormous and embracing serenity as if there was no force of gravity at that moment. I thought that people who die must feel as I felt. No wonder they didn't come back. And I felt so majestic that nothing worried me about my children, nor the newborn baby notwithstanding the great pleasure I took in having my first daughter. And although I love my mother and father so much, even though my father was still alive and I knew I had to continue working to help him financially in his illness, I didn't feel worried, only enormous peace. Nor did I feel guilty for anything. It was something inexplicable.
  Child birth NDE.   

    1101.      Doris NDE     5/3/2007.    NDE 3050.    From Mexico. Original in Spanish translated by Rio.      I was feeling peaceful when an ex-boyfriend arrived.  We started really fighting. He started hitting me. I fell down and lost consciousness. I started seeing a light that was very, very white and many people whose faces I was unable to distinguish. They were all dressed beautifully in clothing like large angels. All of a sudden, a voice told me to go back; it's not your time yet. I came back. I didn't know how to explain this to my girlfriend. She told me she didn't know what to do because she thought I was dead for a long time.
  NDE from domestic violence.   

    1100.      Carolyn B NDE     4/28/2007.    NDE 3069.          Suddenly I was inside the little girl and could see through her eyes. I turned my head and looked up at Him. He was looking down at me with such compassion and love. His eyes revealed such a purity, a holiness, emotion beyond human capability. I knew that no human had the capacity to feel even a speck of the enormity of his love. I was His child and he loved me. He then spoke to me, not through words but through thought. 'It's not your time yet.' It was then that I came back.
  NDE due to severe illness. Profoundly inspiring account.   

    1099.      William W NDE     4/28/2007.    NDE 3067.          They were wearing brown robes (like monks) and carrying a staffs. I could not see their faces because the hood was hiding it from me. As I recall they never said anything to me, but I knew I was about to find out if I had to return. We walked until we came to what appeared to be a very large house, I entered and before me was what I think was God, or someone who had the power to decide if I was to return.
  NDE due to surgical complication at age three or four.   

    1098.      Wayne R NDE     4/28/2007.    NDE 3066.    from Australia      A voice from my next door neighbor who was still alive at the time was in my right ear. He said do not look at the light. I could feel what I thought was the sun behind me but knew instinctively not to look at it. The pull of the light was great and at that time, the same old magnetic pull on my face and upper body was throwing me back into the person under the blanket. Again, the pain and cold from the reality of the road and this time I heard a voice saying, 'He's not dead take the blanket off him.' I was put into the ambulance and after a couple of days I was considered medically all okay but very bruised.
  NDE due to automobile accident.   

    1097.      Eugenia NDE     4/28/2007.    NDE 3025.    From Mexico. Original in Spanish translated by Rio.      At that moment, I'm not sure exactly when, someone or something began giving me an examination of conscience and in the blink of an eye images from my life began passing before me beginning with my childhood. Each image had its counterpart, or as if the actions of my life were being put into a balance. I could see my house, 'alone and sad.' I don't remember exactly hearing a voice, but I did understand everything that was said (as if my mind translated it). They made me see with clarity that my husband wasn't that being who I had judged so harshly and that my son would be just as well off in life without me. At the end of this 'judgment' there is the option of deciding whether one goes on towards death or stays on earth. At the end of the review of your life, they give you the option of choosing between life or death.
  NDE from allergic reaction to medication after surgery.   

    1096.      Francesca DB NDE     4/23/2007.    NDE 3040.    From Italy. Original in Italian translated by Maurizio B.      I had to make a choice, to stay or to go to see what was there. I saw a hot light while I was bearing in mind about it. I decided to go to see the light. I felt very well, relaxed, a wonder, a light never seen, something that was inside me and that came out of me and it continued telling me 'what a beautiful, what a marvel' that one does not die and ask what are we worried of on the earth if there is continuous life. It is necessary to enjoy laughter and rejoice as in the light. We continued to talk to each other here even though I was in coma. I remembered the light telling me what happened. I was home the day after my next door neighbor found me on the landing. When she found me, I was doing the thought and was becoming the thought. I was in wonderful, very green gardens. I still have feelings of immense joy and the absolute certainty that the life goes on - and when I got back in 'earth' I was not scared. I thought at once that the light was the big mystery called God all here.

    1095.      Jean K NDE     4/23/2007.    NDE 3063.          I then heard someone say, 'I can't feel her pulse and there is no heartbeat.' And, then I heard a girl's voice say the same thing. During this time, I was trying to tell them that I was really okay but, yet I wasn't in the same level as they were. I felt my body move up to a sitting position and saw a beautiful light or brightness in the sky and I felt so good and safe. Then next thing I remember was being in an ambulance and the medics trying to give me oxygen, then it seemed like a few minutes later I was awake. Years later in life I had taken a course 'Death and Dying' for college, it was taught by Sister M. I told her about my experience and her knowing Elizabeth Kubler Ross had me write down what had happen. Elizabeth confirmed that I had a near death experience.
  NDE due to apparent faint and unconsciousness.   

    1094.      Vinnie G NDE     4/23/2007.    NDE 3062.          I remember being an indigenous person in pre-Columbian Mexico or Central America. Once again, I had been or was involved in a battle. I saw myself trying to climb to the top of one of the pyramids in Mexico; I have always thought it was the pyramid of the Sun in the ruins outside of Mexico City. I guess I think that because I went there once to visit and I felt so at peace like when I had returned home, as if I had been there before, yet I had never been there before that time. As I am writing this, I remember that on this trip in which the accident occurred we had driven into Mexico City and I remember seeing them in the distance and longing to see them close up again wanting to be there. I can't explain this. I was trying to climb the stairs but I was wounded I felt that if I could reach the top of the pyramid I would be safe. For some reason I don't know why I believe that I was some type of warrior/Priest.
  NDE due to severe motor vehicle accident. Remarkable awareness of many past lives.   

    1093.      Rafeal EH NDE     4/20/2007.    NDE 2961.    From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Rio.      Suddenly I saw myself sort of floating about two meters from my body. As I said, I was twelve years old and felt that floating out of my body was the most normal thing in the world. I looked at the scene with my friends laughing and hitting me to get me up. I don't know how to explain it, but I was only consciousness. I didn't move from the site while I saw myself on the ground. Suddenly I raised my eyes up towards heaven and felt an inexplicable force that pulled me at full speed. Stopping all at once, I looked down and could see the entrance to the school. It's about eight hundred or nine hundred meters from the porch where I lost consciousness to the door into the school where I could clearly see a group of women waiting in the doorway. I couldn't think. I was only conscious of everything around me.
  NDE from childhood prank.   

    1092.      Maria S NDEs     4/19/2007.    NDEs 2950.    From Argentina Original in Spanish, translated to English by Rio      When I returned from surgery there was darkness and I returned through a tunnel of light.  I met my dead father, my aunt and grandparents.  I had life reviews of my life, infancy, adolescence etc.
  Multiple NDEs from a neonatal nurse in Argentina.   

    1091.      CG Possible NDE     4/19/2007.    Possible NDE 2949.    From Mexico. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Rio.      Like the light of the sun but of greater intensity. I only saw trees around me, nothing more; I only saw the tree tops and an intense light over everything, very brilliant, as if the sun was at maximum brilliance.
  There are NDE-like elements, but not enough information regarding if she died or not.   

    1090.      Montse M Possible NDE     4/17/2007.    Possible NDE 2933.    From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Rio.      My experience was as follows: I have asthma and as the result of applying an anti-inflammation cream to reduce pain in my neck I had a severe asthma attack that resulted in respiratory failure. I was unconscious. During the minutes before my loss of consciousness, I was completely aware that my life had ended. I remember, after going through the worst time of my life due to the suffocation I was experiencing, the light went out, everything went dark, and I felt great peace. I saw passing before my eyes images of people I love - very rapidly. Suddenly, awake, three hours had gone by. Three hours of which I have no memory, as if I hadn't been alive. I am alive because they gave me pulmonary-cardiac resuscitation and I responded. That day I came back to life.
  Possible NDE from respiratory failure.   

    1089.      Bill N NDE     2/9/2007.    NDE 21539.          I remember I was looking down at two men in white, two police, and my mother. They were bent over looking down at a boy lying in the street. I could see an ambulance with the back doors open. It seemed as if I was looking down through a kaleidoscope.
  NDE at age 8 due to being hit by car.   

    1088.      Danielle B NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 21538.          It spoke to me and told me that I needed to turn around and go back because it wasn't my time. I was needed for other things. I never saw this person with the voice but I felt the force pushing me back down towards my body.  Before I went back into my body, I heard the doctors saying that they couldn't get a pulse or a heart measure and that they had tried it all.  I was watching them shock me trying to get me back to life.  At that point, the force told me that there were many things that I needed to do still and that I had a baby fighting for her life needing me.  I remember going back down to my body and it was like a strong, steady vacuum.
  NDE due to cardiac arrests during c'sarian section birth.   

    1087.      Barbara NDE     4/16/2007.    NDE 3059.          I remember being in a darkness without boundaries and I was not in a body. It was as if the essence or spirit of me was there. I was floating as if in water but there was no water, just a darkness. I was calm, peaceful, and warm and it felt as though I should be there. I don't know how I knew but I was waiting. I did not questions this, I just knew I was there and it was okay. There was no sound, no feeling, and no pain. And it was completely good. But I was unable to advance to the next part of the experience. Then I was in the intensive care unit and back in my body, but still floating.
  NDE from respiratory failure during surgery. From a nurse.   

    1086.      Dr. M. Ghalabi NDE     1/23/2007.    NDE 16010.    From Iraq, Original in Arabic.      I entered a dark cylinder in space that seemed like a tunnel. White ghosts appeared around me, including the ghost of my mother, who died when I was five. They were reaching out their hands toward the center of the tunnel. Some tried to touch me. I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. Coming out of the tunnel, I was about to leave our universe.
  Amazing NDE from a Muslim Doctor in Iraq.   

    1085.      Paquita NDE     4/13/2007.    NDE 2840.    From Spain. Original in Spanish translated to English by Rio.      I was working in a hotel annex alone. I was vigorously vacuuming a room when suddenly I banged my elbow really hard against the open door and lost consciousness. When I awakened, I saw they have put me on a bed. The boss was there, a doctor, and a coworker. I had peed all over myself. The doctor said that I had passed out. Nevertheless, I was in Manhattan, at water level, the skyscrapers were in front of me, the wonderful sensation I had was that I could go instantaneously at will wherever I wanted. When I began telling this story years later, I said that I didn't have a body, only a head, and that strangely I wasn't wet. Later I understood that I didn't have a body, either, only consciousness. The experience was tremendous and wonderful to such a degree that it took me a long time before I told anyone about it.
  An experience during unconsciousness fits the NDERF definition of NDE. I suspect that there may be differences between those experiences occurring at or near death as opposed to going unconscious but haven't formally studied it yet.   

    1084.      Christopher R NDE     4/10/2007.    NDE 3056.          It was like being in my body, but I was not there. Then I saw a tunnel. It was made of bricks, just like a brick road, only curved like a tunnel. I went through the tunnel. At the end, there was a bright, white light. When I went through the white light, there was a man. I say man, because it was a man's voice. This person was in a white robe. I did not see a face. I did not want to go back through the tunnel; it was so peaceful. I wanted to stay, but was told I had to go back. There was a lot I had yet to learn. I went back through the tunnel and was back in the bedroom. I saw my brother on the bed, and then I slammed back into my body.
  NDE due to electrocution at age seven or eight.   

    1083.      Olma S NDE     4/10/2007.    NDE 3053.          I suddenly thought that I should be moving on and suddenly I was aware of moving through velvety blackness with sparkles (The closest I can think of is outer space surrounded by stars) though somewhat tunnel like. As I reached the distant incredible warm glowing light, a sudden feeling of WOW I'm home, it was so familiar, I know I had been here many times before. I suddenly knew the meaning of life!!  I was communicating with a being unseen, and given the option of staying or going back, This was a tough decision I dearly wanted to see my daughter grow up and I did eventually want to return to my Nursing career, I chose to return and suddenly I was being drawn back into my body.  Strangely I could not remember the meaning of life it was like a curtain had been pulled across that memory.
  NDE due to blood loss from colon cancer.   

    1082.      Mary P NDE     3/31/2007.    NDE 3051.          I was in a small hospital away from my parents and very concerned for myself. They could not take me to surgery and I have a rare blood type that they did not have on hand. It seemed like when I would pass I was in the most beautiful place with green, a river, and all these people were so glad to see me. I did not know anyone who had died in my family at that time. The person that said he was waiting on me was wearing a straw hat, bib overalls with a white handkerchief in the pocket and had the most amazing blue eyes. Also, other people there were helping me. It was so peaceful there that I could have stayed very easily but I was begging them that I had a husband and a little boy to take care of and I couldn't stay.
  NDE due to hemorrhage after delivery.   

    1080.      Glenda H NDE     3/31/2007.    NDE 3045.          The second I died, the thought 'Oh, I'm dead,' casually and matter-of-factly entered my head and there was an immediate acceptance on my part. I did find out about the so-called 'Judgment Day' I feared so much as a child. We judge ourselves and that at first was a big relief but our life is still our job. I was shown what is now called a 'Life Review'. I was shown in living color, like on a movie certain situations, both good and bad, in my life. I was able to see and hear exactly how it was. But the kicker was as I was watching this situation unfold right before my eyes, I was forced, for the lack of a better word, to feel the other person's feelings at the time, not mine. Beside all the life situations shown to me, I was given the capabilities to hear EVERY SINGLE SIGNIFICANT thing that has EVER affected me during my life, the good, bad, and ugly. I heard EVERYTHING at the same time with extreme clarity.
  NDE due to drowning at age fifteen.   

    1079.      Jennifer NDE     3/31/2007.    NDE 3044.          I was hit by a portion of the tree. I felt several things at once. But the first thing I felt and saw when the tree hit my side was being in the middle of a bright light. It was around me and the edges were yellow and red. At that moment, I felt the presence of my granny and my grandpa and felt that they were there with me. I felt that they moved me to where I wouldn't be directly hit by the tree - like they saved me. I then thought, 'Wow, there really is a white light. This isn't how I'm supposed to die - I've got too many things to do.' It's as if time stood still because when I was back in my life, I saw the remaining part of the tree fall, hit the swing, and I watched it continue to fall on me. The actions were freeze framed, piece by piece - but my thoughts moved so fast. All the sounds and smells were frozen as each section moved. Once it all fell, all I heard was crickets and I remember looking at the sky, feeling panic and pain, wondering if I was dying and all the things I would leave.
  NDE due to tree falling on her.   

    1078.      Russell W NDE     3/31/2007.    NDE 3041.    From England.      I then was about ten yards away from the bright light (which was warm and felt nice). Around this bright light was an archway. I then walked into the light and felt no pain at all I felt like it was okay to be there, so peaceful so right. I then heard a voice (I know this voice but to this day I can't work out whose voice it is.) The next thing I remember is looking down on myself with my mom and dad holding my left hand (my mom crying, it really upset me.) I started to move around the intensive care unit ward and I can remember that there were ten beds all with very ill people in and a nurse's station in the center, in front of me. The next thing I remember is floating up towards the roof and that's the last thing that I remember.
  NDE in intensive care unit after his motorbike was struck by car.   

    1077.      K.C. R NDE     3/28/2007.    NDE 3036.          As I got closer the light was brighter. A color of bright white, so brilliant it is hard to describe. It is also like a mist - I could feel it, as I got closer to it. Just before I got to the doorway.  I was in the presence of the light, like being immersed/enveloped in it, I began to feel, all knowing, happy, stress less, exuberant, I am aware of all the answers to literally everything, just this ultra-fantastic existence of all problems vanishing, joy, physical and mental limitless being - that is about my best human description. I walked through the archway of incredible light, and was in a kind of room of this wonderful light. The room was more like an elevator shaft (without the cables or elevator). There was no ceiling. I'm standing in the middle of the 'room' happily immersed in this wonderful misty, powerful light, and I begin to float upwards. Up and up and up, in the beautiful nurturing light. After what seemed like five to ten seconds of floating I never reached a top or anything, but I shifted back to the hospital bed world.
  NDE due to complications of ruptured spleen after accident.   

    1076.      Norma H NDE     3/28/2007.    NDE 3031.          I heard the crash and some screams, then immediately I was in a different place. There was an older woman on my right side who was 'escorting' me, or 'introducing' me to this new realm. The very air was of a golden-peach color, and I heard music of a genre I'd never heard before, and couldn't identify the instruments playing the music. Some distance away from us, I saw a large group of people who were facing us, and I 'knew' they were there to welcome me. I felt such peace and joy. Suddenly, I was told mentally that I would be returned to life for another 'season.' It was then that I heard a distant voice calling me. I definitely did not want to return to the earth plane, but the voice kept calling me. It was an employee from a nearby store who was beside my door, saying, 'Miss, are you alright? Miss, are you alright?' In the emergency room, the doctor (a lady) asked me if I'd blacked out at the scene. I told her that I had not blacked out, I'd been somewhere else. This was something she didn't comprehend, and rather curtly told me that I had blacked out.
  NDE due to auto accident.   

    1075.      Diane N NDE     3/28/2007.    NDE 3029.          I was being worked up for symptoms of light headedness.á This test had you strapped to a stretcher.á The first part was lying flat with electrodes monitoring the heart.á Blood pressures were taken a minute apart for 3 minutes.á Then the stretcher was raised vertically and pressures were monitored every 5 minutes.á At the seven minute mark, I started feeling very strange and said I was going to pass out.á As blackness engulfed me, I heard the staff say 'she's going out.'á The next thing I remember is that I was in this wonderful meadow with brilliant light, warmth and such beautiful flowers.á I had such a sense of happiness and love.á I saw forms but not faces.
  NDE due to medical test.   

    1074.      Terry A NDE     3/28/2007.    NDE 3028.          I guess at that point I passed out. I remember walking along a long corridor of light with a man that I couldn't see, and could only hear. I could see ahead of us a group of people standing there, just there shapes and sizes, no features. I also felt I knew these people. I must have asked my male friend, repeatedly, why am I so happy? I just left my new baby, and my other three children, and my family, because it was Thanksgiving night and all of our family were there watching the birth and eating turkey.á I felt whole and complete Love and Peace. I was so curious why I would feel so happy, and not miss anything or anyone. then my friend spoke to me and said,
  NDE due to hemorrhage following childbirth.   

    1073.      Hope S NDE     3/28/2007.    NDE 3026.          I could see my mother beside me, with a sponge and ice water and I could hear her praying even though she was not speaking out load.  I could then see everything going on outside too.  I was bored with the scene and just then a person spoke to me and I was embraced with great love.  There were several of these people there with me and they told me I had found my way to a different place of life.  They spoke to me just like you would speak to a child, they told me that I was very sick and to get better I would have to go with them.  I was happy to do so. I then saw myself above my house and going higher and higher till I could see the planet from space.   I traveled across space and I was told that I was being taken to the home planet of these people so I could get better.
  NDE at age 5 due to fever from Rubella.  Apparent remarkable healing.     

    1072.      Andy B NDE     3/28/2007.    NDE 2864.    From Mexico. Original in Spanish Translated to English by Carol.      When I thought about that, it was like transporting by only wishing that with my mind, I arrived at the end of the stream that was very narrow. I bumped into a strong ray of light like an intense white ray. I even had to close my eyes until I was not dazzled. Before I opened my eyes, I was thinking that God was that light. While I was opening my eyes, until I could penetrate that light, what I saw was the Virgin of Guadalupe as if made of pure gold. She was shining like the light of the sun. The sparks of her layer were like light sparks. Her rays were shining intensely all around. It was pure light, really beautiful! I was standing there just looking at her for a moment until I saw her face for a moment.
  NDE from a heart attack.   

    1071.      Corinne TL NDE     8/10/2006.    NDE 16008.    Original in French, Translated into English by Jean Peter.      This feeling was as if I had always known. Then my life rewound just like a cassette, like a movie, to come back to start, i.e. my birth. The only image that is burnt forever in my mind is when I saw my mother feed me, as I was an infant. She was on my right side. Anyway, it would have been unthinkable for her to stand on my left. The fridge was small and next to my mother. I was facing the scene as a spectator.   I was awfully scared by the thought of dying, as I certainly did not wish to die. Besides, I told to myself 'What shall my mother say?' I was scared that she would scold me at the thought that I was dying. Behind, my sister was screaming. 
     

    1070.      Edward H NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 3022.          Recall being upside down and flying through the air.  Landed in a ditch.  I felt nothing as if my mind and body were separated.  Found myself in a white clouded tunnel with a bright white light at the end. I was enjoying the experience so much that I became angry when people on the scene offered emergency assistance.  I wanted to be left alone.  Recall someone asking if I were dead.  I said no I wasn't dead. At that point I lost the tunnel.  The rest is history.  I am still here.
  NDE due to being on motorcycle and struck by car.   

    1069.      Bernardita B NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 3020.    From the Philippines.      I was brought to the Hospital by my mother because of an acute asthma attack. I suddenly felt light and I floated. I saw my mother from above rubbing my hands and pleading to the nurses to take care of me as my hands suddenly became cold and limp. At that moment, I blacked out and as sudden as there was darkness a light shines through very bright but not blinding. I saw a closed gate suddenly opened and clouds rising around it. As I entered the gate I heard a voice telling me 'Go back, Bernadette (not the name I use but Bernardita), It's not time yet. You have not met me yet.'
  NDE due to asthma attack.á Remarkable occurrence where she was called a particular name in her NDE that was not what she knew her name to be.á Later, found the midwife who delivered her had recorded her name in her birth certificate as the name she was re   

    1068.      Ally D NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 3019.          I saw myself as I'd never seen me before and I was ashamed but also I had to relive all the horrible abuse, some of which I'd forgotten, all over again in every agonizing detail. I became aware of a presence with me. This presence was so vast and unimaginable I wasn't at first sure of what I was sensing but then I knew it was God. He was everywhere and everything, the beginning and the end, and he was Love. I came to know that Love is a power to rival all powers real and perceived in the Universe, something I never could have understood without this experience. As my life review, which by the way I didn't know what to call it until sometime in the last decade, went along it picked up in speed. It felt ominous and I was battered with all this at light speed and I knew if it got to the end, I was dead.
  NDE due to strangulation at age sixteen.   

    1067.      Mark M NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 3017.          I walked out into the water, walking toward my sister and cousin, Cheri. I hit a drop-off. I was bobbing up and down, drowning. I heard Cheri say, 'Isn't that your brother?' Now I was floating above the water, looking down at my body lying on the beach, a lifeguard was bending over me, giving me mouth to mouth, I assume. The next thing I knew, I was back in my body, I spit up, sat up, he asked me if I was okay, and I said, 'Yeah.'
  NDE due to near drowning at age five.   

    1066.      Gwen P NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 3014.          My cousin's wife told me afterward that eight people had been working on me, that my heart had stopped. Sometime between the efforts of those to start my heart - I found myself in a tunnel. I believe that I saw figures on my right, and left sides as I went down this tunnel. And then I saw this light, like the sun's light, but buffered. A beautiful white light with touches of gold. A wonderful warmth radiated from it. He spoke to me, not verbally, but I heard him in my heart. The thoughts were loving and kind coming from HIM, but I do not remember what was said. I begged, and pleaded to be allowed to return. I had a four year old daughter, and was concerned about her future without me. So I didn't say 'please, please take me', I said 'please, please let me return'. And I did.
  NDE due to severe pneumonia with organ failure.   

    1065.      Dave A NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 3003.          After a few minutes I was alone and slipping away again. I found myself in a dark expanse. I was not alone but saw nothing and no one. I was not afraid. It was understood that I was safe. As easily as anyone understands when it's time to blink, I understood what was expected of me at that moment. A basic translation is as if someone said, 'See,' - as an instruction to be followed. I saw and understood everything, the nature of the universe and how it applies to everything from the beginning of our universe to how we are part of it. It took many years and many moments where I would seem to 'zone out' while a flash of my experience in it's entirety would wash over me and I would get a headache from the amount of knowledge involved. Each time I would retain more and each time the amount more grows.
  NDE due to accident. Very transcendent.   

    1064.      Roy F NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 3001.          What I now know to be a NDE, happened during the surgery to open my windpipe. I have a vivid recollection of being near the ceiling in what looked like a hallway of the hospital. The doctor and two nurses were working over my body furiously. The bed was slanted downward with my head lower than my feet. I was not fearful. I just waited - my brain paralyzed. I was in an iron lung when I did regain conscientiousness. My dad was there. I was later told that I was unconscious for several days. After my recovery, which in itself is a miracle, I remember telling my mom about how the surgery was conducted. In fact, I told her and my dad many times while growing up. I would tell it in front of friends and visitors. Their response always was, 'Baby, there is no way that you could have known that, you were in a coma.'
  NDE during surgery for tracheotomy due to complication of polio at age seven, fifty-five years ago.   

    1063.      Marlene K NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 3000.          The next thing I remember is hovering above my head in an ambulance and watching two male attendants work quickly on my body - I wondered why I couldn't hear the siren. Then I turned around 180 degrees and saw my ex-husband's grandmother standing in a long white gown holding a beautiful bouquet of daffodils - they were gorgeous, as was she - she was in her twenties or thirties and I couldn't get over how beautiful and YOUNG she looked. I felt she communicated in some way that if I took the bouquet of flowers (which reminded me of my own grandmother - daffodils were her birth flower and always her favorites). I could leave with her - that she would take me somewhere. I looked back at my body and perhaps at this time is when I re-entered - because the next memory I have is waking up in a hospital room five days later...
  NDE due to suicide attempt with overdose of Phenobarbital.   

    1062.      Connie L NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2996.          The anesthetist was not paying attention to me or what he was doing, still busy talking about the football game. I struggled, struggled trying to move anything to speak, and could not. I realized that I was going to die, I didn't want to die, I had a husband and three children that needed me. All of a sudden, a very calm feeling came over me and I was surrounded by a white light, very cloud like. I felt myself floating and weightless it was a great feeling and I wanted to stay there. I desperately tried to move up and down, sideways, anything and I heard him still talking about the football game and saying, she is blue, then yelling at me to breathe. I don't remember ever breathing and the next thing I knew I woke up in recovery able to move and talk.
  NDE due to anesthesia complication.   

    1061.      Howardena P NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2995.          It was hard to believe by others as I saw myself or felt I was walking around outside of the car, but also experienced being highly conscious in a dark void, but I was not afraid. Although it was dark, I felt I could see. There was no up, down or sideways - no sense of direction. I was alone; Apparently the Buddhists call this the Bardo.
  NDE due to car accident.   

    1060.      Sandra J NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2987.          After 12:00 midnight I was taken to the operating room and put under anesthesia. I wasn't really informed as to my condition as being life threatening. I guess I was young and uninformed since I was aware as to the bleeding all day but since this was my first child I did not know what to expect. While I was under the anesthesia, I found myself in a very bright warm area high over the operating table. I could hear people talking about the fact that they didn't know what happened. Also, they said that they knew that I had just given birth to a child the day before and they were sure that I would like to be there with my child. The peaceful location, the warmth, the brightness, the calmness of the voices made it a very comfortable experience.
  NDE due to bleeding after childbirth.   

    1059.      Cameron H NDE     3/2/2007.    NDE 2985.          The doctors tried to bring me back to life. They were successful but I remember passing down a hallway that had no doors that was a soft grey tone. At the end, there was an open door with an immense light emitting through it. I felt like I was floating down the hallway straight to the door. I passed through it and was in this vast space that was like a giant Styrofoam sphere, that I was stuck on. I could only travel round and around. I then heard crying and beeps and turned to look where the sound was, and I was back in my hospital bed surrounded by beings that were floating around me.
  NDE due to coma from Ryes Syndrome at age six.   

    1058.      Bonnie B NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2982.    From Canada      All of a sudden everything was black then I saw a light like a multiple shinning radiant glowing of indescribable brilliance and I was being whisked down a tunnel at an incredible speed. There were people outside of this tunnel all along reaching out seeming to want to touch me. They were communicating with each other like a mental chatter, I couldn't recognize any of them yet they seemed familiar, like they knew me. They were like faceless figures. I was not afraid to go forward but all I could think of was no, no I need to go back to be with my children, they are too young for me to leave them, please, please, I need to go back. I kept saying my children, my children, even though I would like to stay. I didn't say it with words it was with my mind.
  NDE due to complication of dental nitrous oxide.   

    1057.      SM NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2978.          It was ten days after surgery and I was scheduled to go home the next morning, but when the nurse checked my pulse early in the morning, she found no pulse. I had bled to death during the night. I remember this causing much confusion in the hospital ward, and my body was rushed to the trauma room. I remember floating near the ceiling and being VERY SAD because I had a six month old daughter that would not have the care of a mommy. The staff administered blood transfusions and I slowly came back into my body sometime later.
  NDE due to bleeding after surgery.   

    1056.      Diana R NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2976.          During the event, I thought I was in the presence of Jesus. We spoke and I was shown a life review. The review was very fast but I seemed to comprehend everything easily despite the speed. After the review was over, I had many questions especially the meaning of life, many scientific questions and the meaning of the universe, etc., type of questions. I was given all the answers and remember that it was all so easy and so clear and why didn't I understand that before. I was told why I was born and my mission or reason for being and then told that my work wasn't done yet and that I had to go back. I was hurt that I couldn't stay because there wasn't anything that I wanted more than to stay. Pure love is the best way to describe the being and place that I would be leaving. Under protest, I was sent back.
  NDE due to cardiac arrest as complication of kidney failure.   

    1055.      Larry B NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2975.          The next thing I noted was that I hit my head. I noted I hit it hard but it didn't seem to concern me. Then I was standing in this place. I guess I could use the word beautiful to describe it but it was more of a mist and a feeling than anything was. I was alone at first. But then people started appearing. I recognized them all. Some relatives and friends. The others, well I knew them somehow. They were all happy to see me but somewhat concerned. I remember the overall feeling from them, as I wasn't supposed to be there. One of them pulled me aside and asked me a few questions. I answered them. He then said that someone was going to come and talk me out of staying. I replied something to the effect of I have no intention of leaving.
  NDE due to severe flu.   

    1054.      Janice H NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2971.          I looked around for a while and wandered to the garden area. I saw my grandmother standing on the other side of the fence in the neighbor's yard. I ran to the fence, so happy to see her. I wanted her to hold me like she did when I was a child. She had a wonderful laugh and was happy to see me too. We talked though it seemed that we communicated by thought rather than words, about general life things, she told me she was very proud of me. She told me she was sorry she left me when she did and was glad that I had acted so responsibly when I found her body. After talking for a short while, she said it was time to go. I wanted to cross the fence and go with her, but she told me no. She said it was not my time, that I still had things to accomplish. She told me that she would always be with me and close by at all times.
  NDE due to severe flu.   

    1053.      Violet P NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2969.          I was having a baby and the doctor could not stop the bleeding. I left my body. I watched them working on me. Then there was a bright light around me and I heard my great aunt's voice. (She has been dead since I was ten.) She asked me if I really trusted my husband to raise my son... I am legally blind without my glasses but the nurse took my glasses before they took me to the delivery room but I could see clearly what the doctor was doing.
  NDE due to blood loss at time of childbirth.   

    1052.      RoseMarie W NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2968.          The smoke seeped into my home and cause me to have more difficulty with my breathing. After going to sleep, I was wide awake. I knew that I was not breathing. I tried to take in some air but it felt as if a large block of cement was on my chest. I was not afraid and I understood what was happening. I knew that I was leaving my body. I never saw a tunnel but I was going backwards from what I perceived to be a place of division. On the other side, I was alive and on this side, I was not breathing. I was moving slowly at first and started gaining speed away from the place of division. It was almost like a surface when you're under water. It's hard to describe exactly what it was like. I was totally aware of what was happening and there was absolutely no fear. My mind and thoughts were moving as fast as lightening. Everything was like crystal. I understood everything and again there was absolutely no fear.
  NDE due to inability to breath due to myasthenia gravis (a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease).   

    1051.      Robert E NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2967.          The first experience took place at the time when my blood pressure was crashing and my pulse rate was so fast I felt like my heart was breaking through my chest. I was tired of the fight. In my vision, I found myself in a dark and barren hospital room. Besides the brightly illuminated bed I was in, the only other item in this room was a plain wooden chair up against a wall. The chair area was also brightly illuminated. In the penumbra, you could barely make out the outline of a doorway through which entered my clone who proceeded to sit in the chair. At this moment, I swung my legs over the side of the bed and faced my companion. I wanted to rip out my heart, which felt, alien and unfriendly. My companion seemed clearly aware of all my feelings. After all, we were one and the same. He said the following, 'Robert, you can choose to stay or check out.'
  NDE due to septicemia in intensive care unit.   

    1050.      Della M NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2966.          There were by now three doctors and five nurses in my room. I though the nurse with the blood pressure cuff was funny. She would pump it up, listen, pump it up again, listen, and pump it up again. I saw one doctor and one nurse fill a syringe with a very long needle that they were going to inject into my heart. I knew I was dead. I had no fear, I felt very much at peace. I was more than willing to go on. BUT at the very last second, I thought what would happen to my four young children in my absence. It was like SLAM I was back in my body and I heard the nurse say I have a pulse. I have told others it was like the hand of God slammed me back into my body much like you would slam a handful of mud against a wall.
  NDE due to allergic reaction after surgery.   

    1049.      William S Probable NDE     3/22/2007.    Probable NDE 2965.          My thoughts were moving faster than the speed of light and at this incredible speed I knew with certainty that my life was over. As I gazed at the earth rushing up at me I could see the birds flying around in the tops of the trees that I was about to impact.
  Three experiences described. Vision at age five. Probable NDE at age ten. Remarkable near plane crash at age forty-four.   

    1047.      Cory P NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2963.          When I hit the surface, water, choking water, exploded from my nose and mouth. Right next to me, I saw this boy with blue dark blue eyes. Can you help me get back? I'm so tired. He looked at me. Put your hand on my shoulder. I ended up on the beach on all fours coughing my guts out. Looking around all I could see were my friends pointing at me. I wanted to thank blue eyes but I couldn't find him. After talking with my friends, they said I swam in alone. I went back a couple of times after that. I never saw the kid again.
  NDE due to near drowning at age sixteen. Was assisted back to shore by being that could not be seen by his friends on shore.   

    1046.      James E NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2962.          Then, POOF, I'm in the light. It's golden, it's beautiful, the pain from the three years of my life gone, the laughter, the love, every emotion I had had in life, was gone. I was one with everything that ever existed, or ever will be. I knew at that moment, the why of all whys. I had no questions; I had need for no answers. Everything was known in that instant I entered the light. Then it spoke to me, as if I was speaking to myself through the voices of everything that can, does, or will exist. It simply said, 'You have to go back,'
  NDE due to coma after surgery at age six due to advanced Hodgkin's disease. Transcendent NDE. Indicates he was immediately cured after NDE.   

    1045.      Denise M NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2959.          I went into a diabetic coma. My parents rushed me to the hospital where they told them I had also had a stroke on the left side of my brain, destroying most of it. They said that I would die within the next twenty-four hours. All of my organs were shutting down. I didn't die. When I went into the coma at my home, Jesus appeared at the side of my bed and asked me to go with him. I did. He took me to the spirit world or what you call heaven and showed me many things. I have to see all of His life. He showed me hell, where the evil people have gone.
  NDE at age ten due to diabetic coma. Very detailed.   

    1044.      Tim B NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2957.          I woke up above my body, and I was still having electrical thoughts. I felt like I was in the shape of a clear ball, and the back of me was connected to some type of electrical force, that was using me, but not hurting me. I never thought this was the afterlife at the time, but after analyzing it now, I can see how it could be. I was surprised how I could move around, by just wanting too. The pressure of going back into my body was rough, but I was hoping it would all work out in the end, and it did.
  NDE due to apparent loss of consciousness after unknown type of needle shot.   

    1043.      Steven T NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2956.          My heart was in ventricular fibrillation and then stopped completely. All of a sudden, I'm in an extremely bright and white room with a large wooden table in the center of this room. Chiseled in the center of the table was an unknown design. (No other articles in the room whatsoever.) Sitting at the table were three knights (like during the crusades with the large red cross on the clothing). Two were sitting side by side with their backs to me. The third was sitting across from the two. All three had their armor helmets resting on the table just to the right of each one of them. They never acknowledged my presence, so I don't know if they saw me or not. The knight sitting by himself stated with a firm voice, 'We need him now.' One of the knights with his back to me stood up, slammed his fist on the table and shouted, 'No, it is not his time!'
  NDE due to heart arrhythmia. Saw three crusade era knights.   

    1042.      Steve F NDE     3/22/2007.    NDE 2954.          I could see a person in the driver seat covered with blood and paramedics working on him. I thought 'Wow that guy's really messed up!' Then I realized it was my truck and the person was me. While this was happening, I felt confused; how could I be standing where the house should be? Why am I standing when I was sitting in the truck? How could I see myself being worked on? Then I turned to my right (facing forward) and I saw the grim reaper, the dark robe, the sickle, no face but where the face should be was just blackness, blacker than anything I'd ever seen before in my life. It was as if you could take the brightest light you could find (the sun, or even a thousand suns and shined it in there and it would just swallow it up). Then I heard a voice in my head say either (come with me, or come to me) and as I stared into the blackness...
  NDE due to car crash. Rare encounter with grim reaper.   

    1041.      Sally S NDE     12/10/2006.    NDE 21484.          My blood pressure dropped out while having an operation to remove a cyst off my lower spine.  I floated out of my body and was watching as I would on a TV.  The medical team work on me to revive me. I got bored watching, and I felt a slight pulling sensation and I started floating toward a soft mellow light in the distance.  Along the way, I felt the presence of positive beings of light and soft beautiful music playing all around me. I felt happy and wanted to reach the light, then I heard, (or felt), a voice, (but inside my head), tell me that I must go back into my body because it was not my time to pass over yet. There was something that I still had to do on Earth - and with that, I was sucked back into my body and awoke on the operating table to the astonishment of the doctors working on me.
  NDE due to surgical complication.   

    1040.      Damien M NDE     12/10/2006.    NDE 21481.    From the United Kingdom      Suddenly I could see myself from above, sitting on the doorstep with my head in my hands. My consciousness was 'floating' approximately twelve feet from the ground. I felt incredibly calm and strangely disinterested in the commotion carrying on below me. I could see people running around and I could hear people shouting.
  NDE due to head trauma.   

    1039.      RF NDE     3/20/2007.    NDE 2910.    Original in Dutch. Translated into English by Wouter.      They were like guides and helped the 'souls' across a river (Styx?). Bubbles rose from the basin and floated into the universe.    All of the bubbles were filled with something. Suddenly a beautiful bright light passed by and everybody fell to their knees and praised that Light. I was about to go through a door of sorts (beautiful music came from behind it) when my name was called and I was allowed to return. Right before I arrived, I had a vision of blinds closing and I knew I was stone-deaf.
  NDEr thinks he may have seen the River Styx.   

    1038.      Ruud L NDE     3/6/2007.    NDE 2819.    Original in Dutch, translated into English by Wouter.      The first week after the accident they injected me literally full of morphine, to keep me in a sort of coma. Afterwards a doctor and my parents told me that I had not been conscious for one moment during that week. The funny part is that I can remember everything that happened at the intensive care. I know my parents came to visit, that my father had to throw up when he saw me, that my mother did not know what to do and could not stop crying. Also, a nurse came to sit by me whenever she could manage the time. I knew she was taking courses in surgery assistance. I saw her and her colleagues working the whole week, with me and other intensive care patients. One given moment, I knew precisely what patient was given which medication and what time.
  This is an amazing NDE!  It proves that the NDE is not brain chemistry because the morphine did not change his lucidity.  The other part is that what he saw in the out-of-body state was entirely accurate and verified.  That means that the NDE was not a ha   

    1037.      Kasandra L NDE     3/2/2007.    NDE 2952.          I remember thinking that God was over doing this white stuff and that the whole environment could use a little color. Nobody came to meet or greet me. I remember telling God that if he were busy that he could just direct me to the library and I would be more than happy to look up the meaning of my own life. No answer. And the white light just kept coming and coming. I remember then telling God, that if this were death it was a little BORING. I told God that he should remember that poverty, celibacy and boredom were nothing that I did very WELL... HELLO ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME? No Answer? I became aware that there was a great knowledge being conveyed to me. I had a sense that all of this was not the right time.
  NDE due to operative complication. Unusual and interesting communication from NDEr during experience.   

    1036.      Darlene K NDE     3/4/2007.    Shared NDE 2948.          I floated up to the ceiling. Lucy entered the room with the bright rays of sun through the window. She had no body, like me. We greeted each other happily and played, spinning and twirling in the air. It was fun. When we stopped, she took me up through a dark tunnel with an intense light at the top. When we arrived, there was no top or bottom. There was nothing there but love. It was pure love. Intense love. Everything was okay. Everyone there was okay. They were all happy, loving beings. They were expecting Lucy. They talked with her and laughed with her. I watched them and felt the love all around me. They reviewed Lucy's past. Suddenly, I felt a being communicate, 'You're not supposed to be here.'
  NDE due to smothering. Interesting encounter in experience with her cousin Lucy. Later found that Lucy died around the time of the NDE, making this a relatively rare example of a shared NDE.   

    1035.      Warida NDE     3/1/2007.    NDE 2870.    From Libya. Original in Arabic.      I felt that my spirit goes out and I saw the surgeon and druggist doctor. Then I met my past brother. I asked him is this the death? Then I saw my mother she was far away from me. She died in 1993 she did not talk to me. I saw daughters of my brother. They ignored me in spite of my great love to them.
  NDE from surgery complications.   

    1034.      Kim H NDE     2/28/2007.    NDE 2804.    From Belgium. Original in Dutch, translated into English by Wouter.      However, the longer that took, the more I felt being sucked upwards. I felt relaxed and calm, but at certain moments, I was really scared; I wanted to return and was prepared to do anything! Then I felt someone taking my hand, I didn't dare to look behind me, but I still did without wanting to. My nephew was standing there, the one who had a fatal car accident a few years ago. He spoke to me. Not with words, but with feelings. He told me to be careful and wary. I had to go back because I was too young. At that moment I did not want to return; I wanted to stay since I miss him dearly. He sent me back; it felt like I was being thrown back in my body.
  NDE from motorcycle accident.   

    1033.      Irene L NDE     2/25/2007.    NDE 2795.    From Sweden. Original in Swedish, translated into English by Lisa M.      I'm in a 'tunnel' that's ox-blood red, it's narrow or sort of 'close'. I kind of float ahead through windings and curves, but I never hit anything. It feels warm, peaceful and pleasant and it's just like 'everything runs smoothly'. There's someone there with me, a presence I can only feel. Suddenly I know and understand everything, I know what everything is like, and I know I'm in the realm of death. The 'journey' continues and I'm a small child and my 'current' self all at the same time. I just AM, it's impossible to describe. We get to this enormous light and I feel that my companion gets there before me, and I just know it's a boy my age: seventeen years. We are greeted by a 'being' that is light, it's like a glow coming from it, I don't know if it's a she or a he. But it radiates so much love and safety it's indescribable. The boy 'disappears' into the light, but for some reason I'm not allowed to come along - I so much want to come too, it's so wonderfully comfortable, I feel so absolutely great - I stay by the light being, I can't get past it, I'm told it's not my time yet. Then everything goes black.
  NDE from an allergic reaction.   

    1032.      Mickie S NDE     2/25/2007.    NDE 2806.    From Austria. Original in Dutch, translated into English by Wouter.      Two people were present, one known and one unknown to me. They both said they would walk with me a bit until my saddle was changed. At that moment, I collapsed. I felt comfortable and warm, and saw myself lying on the pavement at the street. However, the street was not made of asphalt but of glass, with a bright light underneath. Actually, the whole street was light. Lateral to the street were bows of light, behind me. Before me, new bows of light came up. Then it was as if someone woke me up. I thought, 'Please let me sleep.' A doctor was resuscitating me.
  NDE from collapsing while taking a rest from cycling.   

    1031.      Beverly B Possible NDE     2/25/2007.    Possible NDE 2945.          The last thing that I saw before all external vision ended was a glorious fire - the core and center of a marvelous star. Perhaps this was a symbol for the blessing that was now to come to me. Everything faded except for a richly full void in which That and I encompassed All that is. Here, I experienced, in ineffable magnificence, communion with the Light Being. Now I was filled with not just all knowledge, but also with all love. It was as if the Light were poured in and through me. I was God's object of adoration; and from His/our love I drew life and joy beyond imagining. My being was transformed; my delusions, sins, and guilt were forgiven and purged without asking; and now I was Love, primal Being, and bliss. And, in some sense, I remain there, for Eternity. Such a union cannot be broken. It always was, is, and shall be.
  Profound and profoundly life-changing experience. Inspiring!   

    1030.      Barbara G NDE     2/25/2007.    NDE 2946.          My memory is this: You know what orange jello looks like, right? Well, mix some fruit cocktail in it when it is mushy, not totally jelled. I was a piece of that fruit and I went into the orange jello - all that I felt and thought all the other pieces of fruit could feel and know and I knew and felt all that they could feel. Some of the fruit pieces were on the 'edge' of the jello looking down and focusing on 'earth' - the physical plane (as a five year old it seemed to be 'earth') other fruit cocktail pieces were sliding more to the middle, aware of 'earth' but not bothered by it. This place felt so wonderful - like a warm connectedness. I was just checking it out and loving it, feeling loved and gently embraced by the orange jello. A feeling of a voice saying I could choose to stay or to go back to where I came from - that both choices were okay and not to fret because this orangeness was always there for me.
  NDE at age five due to complications of simultaneous childhood illnesses.   

    1029.      Anthony K NDE     2/25/2007.    NDE 2944.          Suddenly the breath I was fighting for wasn't there, it didn't hurt, the room darkened and all sound quit. Then without breathing, I was breathing and I could see, not only the doctor and nurses in the room, but in the room facing the Catheterization Lab, behind glass looking at me. My wife was next to last standing to my left. She is a cardiac nurse and had barged her way into the room. She and the other four in the other room had distressed looks on their faces, so sad, so afraid. I never looked down where I was and wasn't aware anything physical had changed. I wanted to tell them all, especially my wife that I was better than great not to be sad. I felt perfect, no pain, warm, loved, complete, and peace. While I looked at everybody it was through different eyes, not like we see in our bodies.
  NDE due to complication of cardiac catheterization procedure.   

    1028.      Anthony R NDE     2/25/2007.    NDE 2947.          It was as if I was seeing through a kaleidoscope (again, not precisely what really happened, but as close as I can get with words). The things I was experiencing (and truth be told, using the word 'seeing' isn't really even accurate, but I'm limited with words) made no sense at all at first, but after a time, I seemed to be able to make a little bit of sense out of all the whirling images/impressions. After an even longer time, I slowly began to realize that some of the shapes and colors I was experiencing were a 'landscape' of sorts - but then I became startled when it dawned on me that some of the collage actually represented a sentient being. Not long after realizing that there was someone there with me, I knew without a doubt that it was my grandfather on my mother's side. Now, my maternal grandfather died before I was three years old, and I have no conscious recollection of the man at all.
  NDE due to respiratory arrest due to asthma.   

    1027.      Graham B NDE     2/25/2007.    NDE 2943.    From the UK      I noticed an object in the corner of my eye moving towards me at great speed. Before I had chance to react my vision got brighter and brighter until it was pure white, next thing I experienced was floating over my body but facing the opposite direction I was facing before crossing the road, I was moving down the road I just walked down but in the opposite direction. It felt weird; I experienced this for around thirty seconds or so. When I came round I was lying on the floor in a great deal of pain, apparently the bike did not hit me, but I fell backwards, breaking my leg and fracturing my hand, with a large hole in the skin on my head.
  NDE due to fall including head injury.   

    1026.      Greg C NDE     2/17/2007.    NDE 2787.    From France. Original in French, Translated to English by Simon A.      So having decided to amuse myself plugging the connection in, I received an electric shock from head to toe. A massive discharge paralyzed me, I felt a kind of 'burning' inside me, my heart stopped, and during this time (I had no more notion of time, and do not know whether I was lying on the floor for twenty minutes or only thirty seconds) I lost consciousness. I then found myself bathed in a sort of white light, which covered all the walls. The light was not blinding but was of an extreme whiteness, restful, entirely peaceful; I felt no emotions, neither fear nor joy, but an impression of total serenity. I was melting into this light, I was in it and it was in me, we formed a unity. Today I am convinced that other events occurred, following this, but I can no longer remember anything.
  Child NDE caused by electrocution.   

    1025.      Carlos EA NDE     2/17/2007.    NDE 2761.    From Peru. Original in Spanish, Translated to English by Rio.      It happened at the beach. I didn't know how to swim. The water came up to my feet when I lost my footing, slipped, and fell back, because the beach where I went is like a wave. When I lost my footing, I sank. I later tried to get out but the waves kept pushing me down. I felt tired and sleepy but I could see under the water. I don't know at what moment I started going toward a white light. I felt peace and the tranquility was beautiful. As I got closer and closer I was afraid. I knew I was dying and I heard a voice that told me to go back.
  Drowning NDE.   

    1024.      Francesca T NDE     2/17/2007.    NDE 2940.          I had lost a lot of blood. I remember floating, and watching from above the scene of panic by hospital staff as I flat lined, I felt it was quite humorous... Floating away, felt great. Until I realized I had been bought around and described by doctors as dead.
  NDE associated with blood loss and possible allergic reaction.   

    1023.      Frank P NDE     2/17/2007.    NDE 2936.          This feeling is very difficult to explain. There are no adjectives to adequately define this unforgettable feeling. It was all encompassing. Nothing in this world is like it!! Just as this feeling came over me, I started to move and realized that this tunnel had an end. At the end of the tunnel was the brightest white light that I have ever seen!! When you looked at it, the light did not hurt you like our sun would. I knew that when I touched that light that I was going to die. The light was God. I was not afraid of going there.
  NDE due to severe infection, fever, and unconsciousness.   

    1022.      Sharon D NDE     2/17/2007.    NDE 2934.          The time sped past yet never moved. It couldn't wouldn't didn't have to it proved. For I was the one who moved, but the truth just was it was still. Calm and awesome, truly fulfilled. Peace and no sound, yet I could hear. All around me there was a presence, but no fear. In my emotions, I had come home. I was whole and healed I would not roam.
  Two NDEs. One due to being struck by car and another during childbirth.   

    1021.      Davida A NDE     2/9/2007.    NDE 2930.          I sat on my bed and the pains began, so sharp so intense. I could hear my mother calling my dad to come and he was talking to me shaking me trying to undo my arms from twisting distortedly from me being in pain. Everything started going black and white. Then in slow motion and I could see as if my soul was pulling backwards from out of my body, like I was looking through my eyes but being pulled backwards. I was looking at my mother and tried to reach to her, but she was looking at me in awe like she saw my soul leaving me too. Then all of a sudden everything went normal, like I was thrown back in my body and I could now smell apple cider vinegar all around me.
  NDE due to pulmonary embolus.   

    1020.      Jose M NDE     11/10/2006.    NDE 21460.          I served with 101st airborne division in Vietnam from April, 1969 to May, 1970.  May 21, we came against a well-fortified enemy. We attacked a hill next to a wall by a rice paddy.  Just before night, we were told to get our combat gear to charge the hill. I was pretty scared because I knew that maybe I’d get killed. As we attacked the hill, a mortar landed behind me and I flew thru the sky.  The first thing I did was pray for forgiveness, then all of sudden I could see myself laying the ground.  I had no more fear but only peace.  I wish I never came back but as I laid there all night, they came to pick me up.  Once someone touched me I came back to my body.
  NDE from combat in Vietnam.   

    1019.      John C NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2926.          ...this being (I know it was God) was seated on a throne. This very bright light was streaming out from him, I could only make him out for an instant, and he had long hair and a beard. The light was intense and I could feel that he was concerned for me and I could feel a lot of love the likes of which I haven't felt before and I felt he had great compassion for me and had knowledge about everything that had been and whatever was to be. I saw gold streaking with the bright white light also and knew all wealth comes from him too. It seems like I was with him for about three minutes and then I was glided back over to the four gentlemen who were by this very tall white fence. One of them then told me it was not my time yet and before I could tell them that I didn't want to go back here, I was in my body in the hospital gasping and choking with this tube in my throat.
  NDE from an accident.   

    1018.      Andrea C NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2920.    From the UK      Suddenly everything went very calm and peaceful. It was the most wonderful feeling I've ever felt. I felt like a feather image of myself, so free and light. If I could have described myself at that moment in a word, it would be 'whisper'. A man appeared in front of me, chanting happily for me to go with him. He knew my name. He seemed familiar but I didn't know him. This man did not scare me in any way although I knew if I went with him that would be it for me. A force was pulling me towards him. I had to stop myself by wading in the water with my hands. I loved the place I was in and could have stayed there forever, life stresses and all known reality was gone.
  NDE due to surgical complication.   

    1017.      Glen S NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2919.          According to the ambulance driver, I was de-fibrillated three times before my heart started beating again. About three minutes elapsed. During this time, I walked through our maintenance shop. As I went into the last shop, I turned and stared at the rear wall. The whole wall and everything around me was a soft brilliant light. I felt someone was there but I never saw or heard anyone speak.
  NDE due to heart attack.   

    1016.      Sally F NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2918.          This is when I saw a vision of Jesus and an Angel off to the right above me. It was as though there was a window into the heavenly and I could see what they were doing although I wasn't standing next to them. Jesus had his hands stretched down to the angel and he had his hands stretched down to me directly under Jesus. The interesting thing is that I consider myself a Christian without a denomination and the vision of Jesus and the angel looked exactly like the paintings/window panes you see in a Catholic church. Jesus looked like the Catholic Jesus and the Angel looked like a Catholic Angel - not a cherub but a tall, strong, man looking angel. The colors were amazing. I tell you all this because I thought that if/when I ever saw Jesus he would look plainer. He was very radiant. Also, I can tell you that I instinctively knew what they were doing (my friends laugh at me when I try to explain this). Jesus gave the angel and then the angel gave me the 'whammy to live'.
  NDE where she encountered Jesus.   

    1015.      Thomas B NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2915.          I do remember sirens and seeing my mom crying in the back of an ambulance. But it was from above. Then again, everything is blank. The next thing I remember was I was floating in the most peaceful place. There was singing, which was the most beautiful thing I ever heard. Then, I was approached by a man. He told me that I had to go back, that it was not my time. (I wanted to stay. I did not want to leave.) He had then shown me his wrists and right foot. There were wounds. He told me not to be afraid. He then told me that in the most troubling time in my life he would be there and to have no fear.
  NDE due to being struck by car at age six.   

    1014.      Cono J NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2914.    From Australia.      The next thing I knew I was drifting, gliding, weightless as if in outer space. I was surrounded in an intense, warming feeling. There was no light, just the most amazing dark blue color everywhere. I was aware that I wasn't breathing but it didn't matter. All I felt was love, joy, happiness, and every wonderful emotion you could feel all at once. My thoughts had changed - not what I thought, but how I thought. Each thought was like a stone dropped into a still pool of water as if time had slowed (maybe it had for me). Then I became aware of others. There were hundreds of thousands of others. I couldn't see anyone's face at first, just their outlines. We were on the edge of a cliff. They were all waiting. I tried to see what they were all looking out at, but just as I was going to ask, a man in a very old uniform turned to face me and in a forceful voice said, 'You're not meant to be here!'
  NDE associated with stillbirth, blood loss, and seizure.   

    1013.      Floyd NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2908.          After the initial panic and fear, there was euphoria, peace, calmness, contentment, warmth. It was the best experience I have ever had... Like looking at a forest of trees from a close distance in a thick fog, and bright white light shining out from behind the forest, creating shadows and beams of light emitting from the forest.
  NDE due to drowning.   

    1012.      Araceli S NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2906.    From the Philippines.      The driver did not stop instead he tried to mow me down. Behind all this drama, something else was happening to me. I suddenly saw myself sprawled to the ground and there was a silver thread connected to that lifeless body of mine and to me floating; hovering just above the whole scene. I suddenly heard a voice commanding to move my body from head sideways with my face flat on the ground and straightened my feet. From that perpendicular position to the wheels at that I watched my motionless body and I started to repeat what the Voice is commanding - move!!! I saw myself being moved in a split second in alignment parallel to the wheels with the chassis nearly decapitating me.
  NDE due to being run over by a car. Interesting in that a voice commanded her to move her body, which may have lessened her injuries or saved her life.   

    1011.      Linda S Probable NDE     2/3/2007.    Probable NDE 2903.          I did not see the Spirit as I had seen Jesus of Nazareth depicted in paintings, but the innate knowing of my heart remembered and acknowledged Christ. The radiant Spirit was Christ, the manifestation and expression of pure love. Because of my Christian education, I knew no other name to call what I felt as I looked at him. Others might have called him Buddha, or Yahweh, or Great Spirit in the Sky, but the naming did not matter; only the recognition of absolute love and truth was important. Safe in the gentle yet powerful embrace of his love, I rested, secure that everything was okay, exactly as it was supposed to be.
  This is a must read. Astonishingly beautiful and exceptional experience.   

    1010.        Jeremy H NDE       2/3/2007.      NDE 2902.             Sometime between unconsciousness and waking up in the hospital I had a weird encounter with the girl who died in the wreck and what I presumed was God and the devil. It was as if a court room made of stone and then in the shadows were black hooded entities. The light of the fire I seen white hooded ones. Between the podium where the girl and I were standing, was as if a pit of fire and on the other side was the white hooded entity. I looked across on the other side at the white hooded entity and things were so bright. I turned to look at the girl I was with and she was begging and crying and screaming for her life, or so she could get a second chance.  
   NDE due to auto accident. Quite frightening NDE. Rare experience content of encountering the person who died in the auto accident in the frightening experience. 

      1009.      Kami C NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2900.          They said I had to go back and I cried and said no, I wouldn't. That they had to make my mom understand somehow that I was much better off now and she shouldn't worry but they insisted I go back, that my mother needed me, others needed me, I had to heal others. Again, I said 'no' (seven year olds are very selfish) and I meant it. I said I would go to my mother myself and tell her I was okay, that they had a way I could do that right? I began traveling towards my mother and suddenly I couldn't move anymore, they stopped me and they said no, there was no way to do that, I couldn't do that, that I had to go back. I began moving backwards, back to my body and when I hit it I hit it like a ton of bricks and I hurt so bad...
  NDE due to drowning at age seven.   

    1008.      Wendy C NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2897.          There was an incredibly long line of people that were cheering and clapping for me. And it made me feel so good! The type of life I had, especially my childhood, was anything but happy. My sister and my grandmother where the first in line. They were also very happy and joyous - these are words I would not have used to describe them on earth. At some point I learned that all the people who had greeted me were people who had been affected by me, both good and bad (bad by my definition).
  NDE during surgery.   

    1007.      James NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2893.          I saw myself from above I watched a hand push a tube down my throat then the back of the two technicians heads and my body, then a metal tin like the bottom of a bread box and everything was calm then as if a sudden shock to my system I felt like I was in dumped into ice water. I then woke up in the hospital naked I was fighting for my life.
  NDE due to suicidal overdose of narcotics and valium.   

    1006.      Melanie K NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2891.          Next, I was near the window that was about three feet away from the side of my bed. I seemed to be at the same height that I would have been at if I was standing on the windowsill but when I looked down, I didn't have a body. I knew I was out of my body but it didn't scare me and felt better than the pain that I had been in all day. I could see the medical personnel working on me but I didn't really pay any attention to them. The next day the nurses told me that my heart rate and blood pressure were so low that my heart was barely pumping blood.
  NDE due to severe infection.   

    1005.      Stephanie L NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2887.          I felt concern, care, total sensitivity from him, he was not asserting himself in any dominating way yet I knew he was all there was, everything was part of or came from him. He was indescribably sweet, sincere, responsive to me, and there was even humor (like he was saying surprise, surprise). He looked at me as if he was looking at something totally precious and dear to him and I couldn't take my eyes away, I never felt love like that, complete love with no demands, just a total recognition that I was wonderful and he knew it all along and wanted me to know it. Slowly it faded and I was back in the room, or rather the room returned to its normal state and I felt so, so grateful I had been given this gift, this knowledge.
  NDE due to head injury from fall.  Encounter with extremely loving being.   

    1004.      Sharon L NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2886.          I have never been the same since NDE when I saw my body in the street. My life all played back to me like on a video. I saw my body disappearing as I was moving, feeling like I was floating up. I felt total peace, calm.
  NDE due to head injury from being hit by bus.   

    1003.      Matthew J NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2885.    From the UK      I fell from a tree whilst trying to tie a rope to make a swing. I remember falling and feeling a warm sensation as if I were wrapped in a blanket. I remember looking down from where I'd been in the tree and seeing myself lying on the ground below with my younger brother sat beside me. I felt sick and then remember being about twenty feet from my dad's house in the company of my little brother and then awaking in hospital a few hours later. I was told that I'd received three hairline fractures to the front of my skull and a broken cheek bone.
  NDE due to head trauma from fall.   

    1002.      Joseph V NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2879.          I remember going to the surface twice then I was surrounded by a beautiful white light. I was in a tunnel but remember little more of the experience. Thinking back on the event the vision of things was not the same as seeing. It's like seeing without knowing what you're seeing.
  NDE from drowning at age eight which occurred fifty-four years ago.   

    1001.      Peter K NDE     2/3/2007.    NDE 2877.          I also saw all of my deceased relatives with her, thousands of them. They were in translucent spirit form. Ethereal if you will. Yet I could make out their features. I could see through them. They were all calling to me to come to them, be with them. I told them to wait I had to go to the light first. At the time, I knew everything that had ever happened in the world, everything that would happen in the future, and everything that was happening at that moment. I was one with God or the Collective soul, Father sky a Higher power. Whatever label you wish to attach to it. It was perfect love. The light grew brighter than the sun as I got closer. I did go through a tunnel effect. At the end, the light coalesced into a human form. I didn't know it then but as I meditated on the image of that form over the years I realized it was myself at about age forty.
  NDE due to severe bleeding at age six.   

    1000.      Will Y NDE     11/10/2006.    NDE 21434.    From the UK      I looked at myself lying there from the outside of  the crumpled car.  A voice standing beside me was saying, ‘Well, it's your choice to do you want.  You can follow the light or continue on earth and face the music.’  I replied that I would face the music.  On that answer, I awoke outside and facing the car crumpled up fifty feet away from the lamppost.
  NDE due to auto accident in suicide attempt.   

    999.      BV NDE     1/26/2010.    NDE 16007.    Original in French, Translated to English by JeanPeter.      I’ve was in surgery in 1993 for a tympanoplasty. I was under general anesthesia.  After surgery, I vaguely woke up, and heard I was in the wake up room. Then I fell ‘asleep’ again. And then, at some point, I felt as if I went through a ‘doorway.’ A sudden light bathed each and every one of my cells. I didn’t leave my body, but its nature changed, from a body made of cells, to a light body. Each cell was a sun, warm and radiating all over my being. I was a psychic light, a light of love. I felt good in my body, and my soul was bathed in warmth and love.  A beautiful being invited me to come with him. People came to me, greeted me, welcomed me and expressed their joy in seeing me. Everything took place around a magnificent and radiating oak tree. It was not time for me and the being just took me away. I had to see and feel all of it to pluck up courage and resume the path of my life. It was as a gift granted to me to embolden myself.  Then, I was back to my material body. The nurse shook me and yelled for me to breathe. I still hesitated a moment, then I resumed breathing. I cried a lot. I wanted to clear my body of all the tears I did not shed until then. I wanted to set the counters to zero. The nurse stroked my face to comfort me.  I would have loved to stay there, but it wasn’t my time.  I am happy to share this experience with many people through the internet. Kind regards, BV.  
     
    998.      Amro NDE     1/31/2007.    NDE 2814.    Arabic NDE.      I knew that something strange was going on with me. Suddenly, I looked into the street, but I didn't find the street or anything of the surroundings because everything disappeared. All the life around me looked like a tube. I was surprised to find myself feeling-lessly going towards the tube to a hole which seemed as if it was a gate of that tube. In this moment, I heard the voice of my child calling me. I turned my face. I saw myself sitting in the chair and my head is down on my chest. My two children were trying to wake me up while they are weeping. I felt a bit sorry and bit sadness. I knew that I had died. I didn't feel afraid, but the opposite. I felt a kind of relief I hadn't experienced in all my life. I had the strange feeling that I now know all the sciences and human knowledge such as medicine and engineering and chemistry. When I reached the end of the tube, I saw my dead father and my cousin in their full appearance.
  This is one of our best Arabic NDEs so far!   

    997.      Jim L Probable NDE     1/30/2007.    Probable NDE 2845.          I left my body (OBE) and found myself across the street in a wooded area that opened into a beautiful meadow, with a small pond in the center of it. Around the pond, there were other children at or around my same age. The children were laughing, and playing cheerfully around the edge of the water and they seemed not to have a care in the world as they invited me to join them even though they never spoke a word or made any eye contact with me I just knew that somehow I should be part of this new found happiness. I remember watching a boy and a girl on the opposite side of the pond.  They were skipping and running and there seemed to be traces of glitter or gold that trailed off them only to quickly fade away when they stopped to investigate a flower or frog that they would see on the pond's edge, but quickly reappear once they moved again. The colors in the meadow were very brilliant and there seemed to be a warm yellow glow enveloping the whole area. There were also lots of animals and they too seemed to be caught up in the sheer love that encompassed the whole area.
  Probable NDE from rheumatic fever as a child.   

    996.      Mathilde M NDE     1/27/2011.    NDE 16006.    From Switzerland.  Original in French, Translated to English by Jean Peter.      I was a refined, sublime consciousness. I bathed into cosmic energy, and simultaneously was wide open. I was limitless, as if I had contained all the space in the universe. I perceived, felt, and had all properties of a living being, but acted in a dimension located out of matter and out of time. The feeling was tender and peaceful. The light I saw, through non-sensorial perception, located on another level from me, was intense. It was radiant but not blinding. A golden color illuminated the immensity and allowed my consciousness to embrace the whole scope of it. The entire universe was visible.
  Great experience sent to NDERF from Evelyn Els'sser-Valarino.   

    995.      Sandi T NDE-like     1/21/2008.    NDE-Like 16005.          The simple gist of the experience is that my soul left my body. I was in ethereal form with the extreme alertness that I had separated from my physical body and shot up into the heavens with a speed unknown to me here on earth.  The sensation left me breathless, exhilarated, and in wonder.  I remember vivid reds, oranges, and pinks in clouds and swirls. Then realized that I was coming into the presence of a Holy energy.  Words cannot describe it but the knowledge was vivid that this energy was of God. The amazing love, compassion, and warmth enveloped me.  No other experience on earth has ever matched that energy in the 'heavens.'  To my surprise, I passed this energy (everything was at lightning speed) and became aware that I was coming into the 'energy field' of my father, who had died in 1986.  I remember the knowledge that I would be meeting him and the emotion of joy. At nearly the same time of this recognition, I came back into my physical body remembering words to the effect of 'not time.'  I am a psychotherapist that works in oncology, often assisting people in passing over.  Shortly after the dream, I experienced a vivid awareness and sense of knowledge. Awareness that the energy that I was 'bathed' in the dream offered healing properties in this earthly realm.  I sought out experts in churches, metaphysical arenas, dream interpretation, and other avenues.  I am still unsure as to what happened to me.  My awareness of this experience is with me every day.  I have no fear of death and long for the connection in the other world.  This is my dilemma.  I have trouble with electrical gadgets or computers because they seem to short unpredictably. I have become a spiritual director since the experience but am quiet about the actual 'dream.'  I continue to work with people who are dying as well as other persons with cancer.  I recently went to Bhutan for a month of solo trekking in the Himalayans and this is the closest I come to the experience. I am in a bind now as I long for the freedom offered me outside of my body. I am fairly aimless and see little purpose in earthly goals.  I need to have a 'place' to go with this. But I feel awkward completely identifying with near death experiencers as I wasn't declared clinically dead and there were no witnesses to whatever happened to me.
  NDE-Like   

    994.      Murilo F NDE     1/23/2007.    NDE 2757.    From Brazil. Original in Portuguese, translated to English by Simon A.      Firstly, I became dizzy, then fainted in a classroom, and saw tunnels of light, and felt myself outside my physical body.
  Very Short experience.   

    993.      Oscar T NDE     1/4/2007.    NDE 2876.          That's when I said goodbye and started to turn toward the light. After I said goodbye, I felt pure happiness. I never have felt that happiness since that time. Just about that time, I almost turned around.
  NDE due to electrocution.   

    992.      Kathleen D NDE     1/4/2007.    NDE 2875.          The doctors and nurses were still busy working on the woman in the bed. I remember as I looked down at them, I said to the angel, 'Why don't they just let her die?' I did not realize, at that time, the body that I was looking at was mine. 'She must live,' she said in a soft calming voice. 'She has a son to raise.' Then in a commanding voice, she said, 'You must go back now.' I turned to look at her. It was my mother. Since her death, I always dreamed of her pale with bed sores and bandages, but this time it was different. It was the first time I had seen her looking so young and healthy. Mother looked like a beautiful twenty-two year old woman with a perfect body. Just then, before I could say a word, I was pulled into the lifeless body below. I felt pain.
  NDE from post-operative infection.   

    991.      Harry B NDE     1/4/2007.    NDE 2873.          During the time I was unconscious, I found myself without a body in the middle of black, misty darkness. The darkness was infinite like space. The blackness was of a color that I had never seen. It had a density, but also clarity. I could see in all directions and move at any speed in any direction. I was hovering in the middle of space without a body. Even though I didn't have a body, I could see as if I had eyes. I didn't need to breathe. I felt perfect peace, love and happiness. In the distance, I saw a big light - the size of a door. I didn't go to the light because I didn't feel the need to go to it.
  NDE due to alcohol overdose at age sixteen.   

    990.      Mel W Probable NDE     1/4/2007.    Probable NDE 2867.          I understood I was in the presence of an all-knowing spirit. Whether this was actually God or not, I can't say with certainty. I thought of him/it as God though. This being communicated complete acceptance and love in a way I had never before (and have never since) felt. I understood for the first time that everything was as it should be. I had been a deprived and confused kid for many years and I had a lot of anger before this experience. I asked (thought), "But what is the secret meaning of life?" The answer was given as love. Nothing more and nothing less. I can still recall the sheer joy of understanding this simple and complete idea. I understood it at that time in a way I've never come close to understanding and feeling it since then.
  Drug overdose and unconsciousness at age 17.  Remarkably transcendent experience.  Content of experience suggests with near certainty that this was a NDE.   

    989.      Benny M NDE     1/4/2007.    NDE 2866.          Just to note, with no loss for the incredible beauty of the experience, the colors, peace of mind, painless and comforting feeling experienced in this event I will not try to describe, they were incredible. I know I will struggle to include every detail, which is impossible to do. The tunnel was large with soft rounded edges flowing into it. It was soft blue in color, not claustrophobic but warm and comforting, inviting. As I entered the space around the entrance, I floated in and started to move forward. I began to see events appearing along the surface of the tunnel, like a million large screen TV's, or panels lining the walls but that is poor description as to what I really experienced. The events seemed to surround me from all sides. I felt at first without realization, some connection to these events. Within a few seconds I realized it was my life and memories and events that only I would understand and put meaning to.
  NDE due to cardiac arrest.  Remarkably detailed description of a life review in a tunnel.   

    988.      Kiko M NDE     1/4/2007.    NDE 2865.          Then all of a sudden a bright light appeared and I looked up towards it. In the midst of this light there was a man smiling towards me. He appeared to be in front of a golden judge's bench that was huge. He kept right on smiling. He could like turn in a complete circle and still look at me. I was so amazed at this. My feeling started to change from complete helplessness to overwhelming love and comfort. I asked is this GOD or JESUS?  He kept looking at the bright light right above him. He was so bright and had the most beautiful colors surrounding him. I can't really describe it all in detail.
  NDE due to auto accident. Initially saw demonic creatures across a 'ditch', then a light and a being appeared.   

    987.      Anne C NDE     1/4/2007.    NDE 2860.    From Canada      I went through a very dark black tunnel. It was the blackest black possible. Then what seemed like a door opened and I entered what was the most beautiful place with the most beautiful music ever. I was just so happy to be there.  Then, I was pulled back out through the door and again through the black tunnel. I felt a hand on my cheek.  A nurse said she was just trying to save my life. I remembered later that I had said 'So who asked you,' to the nurse. I didn't want to come back and have never been afraid of death since.
  NDE due to complications after surgery.   

    986.      Arlette KY NDE     1/4/2007.    NDE 2858.    From Canada      What I now know was an aura passed, just unconsciousness, not aware that I was gone. Floating, no sound or smell, a feeling of utter peace, no forward, or backwards or side to side, in a light part of the light, no weight, no pain, no body awareness. Brought to as an external pacemaker being put in my leg, left again, jolted to be brought back, did not want to leave the peace and contentment, did not realize that that was death.
  NDE due to seizure.   

    985.      John D NDE     1/4/2007.    NDE 2857.          I immediately saw my body lying on the floor. I was not afraid and was curious at best. Everything seemed to happen at the same time. It seemed as if the house had no roof, I kept rising and my body became smaller. I wanted to say goodbye to my parents and my brother but realized that it was not important, that everything we consider such a trial on Earth is so trivial that it is laughable. I could hear what I can only describe as a combination of music and singing, it was the most beautiful music that I have ever heard. It seemed as if I had complete knowledge of the universe. I can't even explain how wonderful I felt, words can do no justice to that feeling. All of a sudden, I returned to my body and got up. I was very angry that I came back.
  NDE due to severe illness at age fifteen.   

    984.      Friend G NDE     1/4/2007.    NDE 2856.          I heard the doctors say to the visiting family that the whole family should be called because I would not make it through the day. Not long after I saw a light. It is not like any light seen on earth. The light can be described as life itself. The best way to describe it in terms someone who has not seen it can understand is: one needs to imagine the sun coming in through the window and shining on a plant. This is the best image that can convey what the light was like. The light spoke to my spirit and said: 'Rise and be healed!' Immediately I came out of coma, felt somewhat better, and sat up. When the doctors and my family came in my room they were very surprised to see me sitting up and by my telling them, knew I would recover.
  NDE due to car accident - shared by a co-worker.   

    983.      Sue V NDE-Like     1/4/2007.    NDE-Like 2869.    From Australia      I was aware of all things from the smallest organism to the biggest happenings of outer space. I had a 'knowing' of everything and anything. Above my head and to my right a bright light (not blinding but brighter than any light I have known) flowed quickly towards and over me engulfing me and all the other souls in the universe and down on earth (which I was fully aware of entirely). Simultaneously, the light was also this complete LOVE. It was a type of love that cannot be described as it is not like anything I have ever known. The love came with the light. It was received and given at the same time. It spread from what I instantly knew was God to encompass everything in the universe and beyond. The love was like bliss and so complete that there was no room for anything else. (No room for evil.)
  Remarkable OBE while driving.  Very transcendent and life-changing.
