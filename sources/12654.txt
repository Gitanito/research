I noticed that she was carrying a McDonald's bag in her right hand. I can't say I followed her very long, and did not know where she was going. It really didn't feel unusual at the time, it just was. Noticed her clothes (jeans, shirt, etc.), and the cleanliness of the hospital. Don't recall any voices or noises.
