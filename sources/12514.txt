  		              		Experience Description   

    After nose surgery, I was not able to breath. For a few seconds, I was feeling like I was being suffocated so they gave me oxygen. When I was suffocating, I felt really sick.  Then I saw two people, but could not see their faces clearly. One of them was a woman and the other one was a man. The man was very tall, brilliantly very white, and was standing at the foot of my bed. They told me to, 'Get ready to go together. We came to take you.' It only took a few seconds and that was all I saw. But I understood at the time, that they meant get ready to go to the other side; or in simple words, prepare for death. I still remember this scene very vividly after several years past.
