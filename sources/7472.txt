I said I was dying and they sent me to a psychiatrist. Eventually I was admitted into hospital on a Friday. They took x-rays of my lungs but nobody looked at them. On Sunday, I felt even more ill and I had to drag myself out of the bed to go and wash. I stumbled back to the bed and I was only just able to throw myself on the bed and push the buzzer. I felt myself slip into a kind of emptiness. I remember one of the other patients coming to me and rock me in her arms. Also a nurse came who shook me.

Then I was alone again and although I was lying with my back towards the window, I was looking out of that window. In the distance, I saw a glowing point light up. While I was watching it became bigger, like the sun rising and it came through the closed window into the room and embraced me completely. Then all went quiet inside me. All I felt was a warm love, peace, and a feeling of happiness that is difficult to put into words. It seemed I had had a lung embolism and the doctors had saved me from dying. For a long time I have longed for that feeling of love.
