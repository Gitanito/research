I
G ather us in, Thou Love th at fillest all,
G ather our rival faiths within Thy fold ;
Rend each m an’s tem ple’s veil, and bid it fall,
T hat we m ay know th at Thou hast been of
old.
G ather us in ; we worship only Thee ;
In varied nam es we stretch a common hand.
In diverse form s a common soul we see ;
In m any ships we seek one spirit-land.
Thine is the m ystic life great India craves,
Thine is the Parsi’s purifying beam ;
Thine is the Buddhist’s rest from tossing waves,
Thine is the em pire of vast China’s dream.
Thine is the Rom an’s strength without his
pride,
Thine is the Greek’s glad world without its
slaves ;
Thine is Judea’s law, with love beside,
T ruth th at enlightens, charity th at saves.
VI
p
Each sees one colour of Thy rainbow light,
Each looks upon one tin t and calls it heaven ;
Thou art the fullness of our partial sight,
We are not perfect till we find the seven.
Some seek a Father in the heavens above,
Some ask a hum an image to adore ;
Some crave a spirit vast as life and love,
W ithin Thy m ansions we have all and more.
O glorious Triune God, em bracing all,
By m any paths do men approach Thy
T h ro n e ;
All Paths are Thine ; Thou hearest every call ;
Each earnest seeker has Thee for his own.
Rev. G. Matheson

O Everlasting Light,
Giver of dawn and day,
Dispeller of the ancient night
In which creation lay.
0 Everlasting Health,
From which all healing springs,
My bliss, my treasure, and my w ealth,—
To thee my spirit clings.
O Everlasting Strength,
Uphold me in the way,
Bring me, in spite of foes, at length
To joy and light and day.
0 Everlasting Love,
W ell-spring of grace and peace,
Pour down thy fulness from above,
Bid doubt and trouble cease.

CO M M EM O R ATIO N O F T H E
G R E A T T E A C H E R S
T he Fo u r th Wo r l d -Teacher
Power : WISDOM of the STAR, whom do we
serve ?
Wisdom : We serve the MYSTIC STAR, whose
Light dispels all darkness.
Congregation: “ In Him is no darkness at
all, but men turn their backs on His Light, and
then walk in their own shadows, crying out
it is dark.” 5
Wisdom: JOY of the STAR, what is the
MYSTIC Star that we serve ?
Joy : It is “ the Ligh^ which lighteth every
man that com eth into the world.” 6 The rays
of that Light make the life of all things visible
and invisible.
Congregation: In IT we llive, of IT we are,
and through IT all shall be well with us.
Joy: BEAUTY of the STAR, in what manner
shall we serve ?
5'
Beauty : We serve the MYSTIC STAR by the
Ray of it within ourselves. LIKE TO LIKE—
so works the power of our Brotherhood.
Congregation: “ I am the Vine, ye are the
branches.” 7 “ At that day ye shall know that
I am in My Father, and ye in Me, and I
in you.” 8
Beauty : LOVE of the STAR, where shall we
seek the MYSTIC STAR ?
Love: North and south, east and west,
above and below shines the glory of the
MYSTIC St a r . But none may see its full
glory till he has beheld it in the faces of his
fellowmen.
Congregation : “ Thou woman dost become,
and man, and youth, and also tender m aid ;
when old, Thy steps with staff Thou dost
su p p o rt; Thou takest birth with face on every
side.” 9
Love : POWER of the STAR, teach us to see
the MYSTIC Star in the faces of our fellow-
men. We wait to learn the WAY of the
S ta r .
Power: My brothers, two of Earth's great­
est have taught the W A Y of the ST A R to
Angels and to men. They are the Twin Stars
of Humanity, the “fir s t fru its of them that
6
slept ”.1
0 Flesh of our flesh, life of our life,
fo r our sahes They toiled, and fo r us They
achieved, and They gave us Their Starlight
in the religions which They founded.
Congregation: Praise and thanksgiving be
to Them fo r ever and ever.
Power: My Brothers, “ There is a spiritual
dynasty whose throne is never vaeant, whose
splendour never fails ; its members form a
golden ehain whose links ean never be torn
asunder, fo r they draw baek the world to God
from Whom it eame.” 1
1
Wisdom: They are the World-Teaehers of
our Humanity, and eaeh is a King of R ight­
eousness and Guardian of the Wisdom. One
after another, in long sueeession of time,
They teaeh the W A Y of the ST A R to men.
Joy: Seven are the “ Brothers of the
Glorious M ystery ”•12; five have already shown
men that W A Y.
Beauty : Three of the World-Teaehers eame
and taught the W A Y of the ST A R in the
dim dawn of time, and men have now fo r­
gotten Their way.
The religions of the Fourth and the F ifth
World-Teaehers are yet with us, and the
Starlight still shines bright in their shrines.
7
Love: Teach us the W ay of the Fourth
W orld-Teacher, as He gave us His Starlight
at different epochs of time.
Power: My brothers, long ago, to the
peoples of the Atlantean race, He gave His
wisdom in many a great religion whieh has
sinee passed away. He taught men the
m ystie Trinity of manifestation, and the
Doctrine of the One Life without and within.
Sometim es He eame H im self as the Li&ht-
bringer; sometimes He sent His diseiples as
His holy prophets to inspire and teaeh the
world. One light whieh He lit long ago still
shines in the teaching of Harm lessness whieh
Jainism proclaims even to-day. A nd He gave
to the Hebrew people the m ystery teaching
of “ Holiness unto the Lord ”.1
3
A fte r the Aryan peoples began their
work as the F ifth great Race of mankind, He
eame five times, and gave us His Starlight in
five great Religions whieh He founded.
Power: In far off days in ancient India, He
came as Vyasa, and this was the teaching He
gave :
“ The Man in the Sun ” is the Lord and
Giver of Life ; the radiant orb is His outerm ost
garm ent. His Life is our life; He nourishes
I
8
us with food for our bodies, with senses
for our feelings, and with thoughts for our
inspiration. In His sunlight is our purification.
Very God of very God, the sole Source of
Life and Light and Love, He gives us all that
He is, as He shines from mom ent to moment.
Worship H im ; give as He gives; so shalt
thou become one with His Splendour, for
“ That art thou ”.1
4
Power: So taught Vyasa, Lord of Splen­
dour ; and to reverence in the Unity of all
the Pow er of the Mystic St a r ,
Congregation : My faith I pledge.
'Wisdom: Again He taught the Way of the
STAR, in ancient Egypt as Tehuti or Herm es
the Thrice-G reatest, and this was the teaching
He gave :
“ The true Light which lighteth every
man that eometh into the world " 1
5 is Osiris,
who dwells in the heart of every man.
“ Osiris comes forth from the Light, He
dwells in the Light, He is the Light.
“ The Light is hidden everywhere ; it is in
every rock and in every stone. The Light is
nearer than aught else, within a man's very
heart. A ll comes^forth from the Light, and
to the Light all shall retu rn .”1
6
9
“ Look for the Light. Follow the Light.
Thou art the Light. Let th at Light shine.” 1
7
Wisdom: So taught Tehuti, Lord of Light;:
and to reverence in the Light the WISDOM
of the MYSTIC STAR,
Congregation: My faith I pledge.
Joy : Again He taught the Way of the STAR:
as Zarathushtra in ancient Persia.
And this was the teaching He gave :
The Fire is the purest of all the elements,,
and the purifier of all things. All fire is th e
sacred Fire of the Sun.
It is heat. It is light, It is health and
strength, and by It all have life and
motion.
W ithin a m an’s heart too is the saered
Fire. It nourishes his hopes and dreams, It
purifies all that is unelean within him.
Blessed is he who sees th at Fire burning in
his heart and brain. Then out of his h ea rt
come Pure Thoughts, out of his lips Pure
Words, and all the Actions of his hands are;
pure and mighty.
Joy: So taught Z arathushtra, Lord of Fire,
and to reverence in the Fire the JOY of the
My stic St a r ,
Congregation : My faith 1 pledge.
10
Beauty: Again He came to teach the WAY
of the STAR. He came as Orpheus, a singer,
and this was the teaching He gave :
Sound is in all things ; the tiny atom s as the
=great stars give their tones to the Divine
Harmony.
W ith rustle of leaves and the patter of
rain, with crash of thunder and the roar of
the su rf, Nature weaves a wondrous harmony
to accompany the song of life which the
Divine Musician sings. Life is beauty, life is
joy, and all creation resounds to the harmony
o f the Creative Word.
Beauty of thought, beauty of feeling, and beau­
ty of action are the source of life and joy for men.
If a man will but harmonise himself, then
the Divine Harmony will m anifest through
him, and make all Nature glad.
Beauty : So taught Orpheus, Lord of Sound,
and to reverence in Divine Harm ony the
B eauty of the Mystic St a r ,
Congregation : My faith I pledge.
Love : Once more He came the last of many
times, as Lord Buddha, the Teacher of Nirvana
and the Law.
And this was the teaching He gave :
T here are four Noble T ruths inherent in life.
11 *■
In men's lives m isery is greater than
happiness— this is the F irst Noble Truth. A ll
m isery arises from the thirst for life— this is
the Second Noble Truth. Eaeh m an, w ith­
out help of priest or book, ean by his own
efforts put an end to the Craving which
causes m isery—this is the Third Noble
Truth. r :
. '
•
The Fourth Noble T ruth is the W ay—
the Noble Eightfold Path which leads to the
ending of m isery: Right Belief, Right Thought,
Right Speech, Right Action, Right Means of
Livelihood, Right Energy, Right Contemplation,
and Right Realisation l8.
Loye: So taught Buddha, Lord of Law, the
Suprem e Teacher of Angels and men, and to
reverence in the G reat Law the LOVE of the
My stic St a r ,
Congregation: My faith I pledge.
Power: Through long ages the Fourth
W orld-Teacher taught Angels and men th e
WAY of the STAR. T hat WAY is :
In the Unity,
Wisdom : In the Light,
Joy : In the Fire,
Beauty : In the Sound,
Love : In the Law.
12
Power: And when He had ended the happy
journey which led to Buddhahood, He taught
us to know the greatest blessings which the
MYSTIC Star bestows on m ankind :
T he Gr e a t e st Blessin g
Power:
Not to serve the foolish,
But to serve the wise,
To honour those w orthy of honour,

And whatever word be well-spoken,

To follow a peaceful calling,
Congregation:
This is the greatest blessing.

To give help to kindred,
Deeds which cannot be blamed,
Congregation:
This is the greatest blessing.

Not to be weary in well-doing,
Congregation :
This is the greatest blessing.

Congregation:
This is the greatest blessing.
Craftsman :
To be long-suffering and meek,

Congregation :
This is the greatest blessing.
14
Joy :
Self-restraint and purity,
The mind th at shakes not,
W ithout grief or passion, and secure,
Congregation:
This is the greatest blessing.
Scientist:
On every side are invincible
They who do acts like these,
On every side they walk in safety,
Congregation:
And theirs is the greatest blessing.1
9
Congregation rises.
Power: My brothers, thus ended for the
Fourth G reat W orld-Teacher the happy journey
which led to Buddhahood. All th at He had
gained He gave us in the good Law which
He proclaimed, and in His never-ending Love
for men. And passing from our midst, He gave
the welfare of the world into the hands of
our Lord and Master, in W hose Service we
labour to-day.
Congregation :
IN W H OSE SERV ICE W E LABOUR
TO-DAY.
Congregation is seated.
COMMEMORATION OF THE
GREAT TEACHERS
T he Fifth Wo r l d -Teacher
Congregation stands.
Power: “ In the beginning was the Word„
and the W ord was with God, and the W ord
was God ” ;
Wisdom: “ The same was in the beginning,
with God ” ;
Joy: “ All things were made by Him, and
without Him was not anything made that was
made ” ;
Beauty: “ In Him was life ; and the life was
the light of men ” ;
Love: “ And the light shineth in d ark n ess;
and the darkness com prehended it not
The Five : “ And the W ord was made flesh ” ;
Congregation : “ And dwelt among us.” 2
0
Congregation is seated.
16
Pow er: W hen our Lord began His work as
th e G reat W orld-Teacher, He opened to men
tw o new Paths to Salvation—the Path of
Beauty and the Path of Devotion.
He sent His Starlight to shine over
>
Greece, and it beeame the love of the Good,
the True and the Beautiful, whieh made the
.glory of that sunlit land.
Eastwards to the Chinese peoples He sent
His diseiple Lao-Tze to teaeh men the Tao,
the Way to the Divine through Peaee and
Non-Resistanee; and He sent to them yet
-another diseiple, Confueius, to teaeh how all
m en are equal in nobility and virtue, if only
they will train them selves to be “ superior
men," and strive to promote the harmony of
Heaven and Earth and Man.
And, when the world was ready, He eame
Himself, and was born in India as Shri
Krishna the Well-Beloved.
W isdom : W hen as a little child He lived
in the woods of Vrinda-vana, all Nature sang
a paean of joy. For He was “ the W ord
made flesh,” and all who looked on the
Divine Child felt opening within their hearts
;a new flower of the soul, the flower of
Devotion.
17
Then as He grew to manhood, He played
upon His flu te the Song of Life, the while
He taught that He is the Light of men,
and that through Him lies an open door
to God.
He said :
W hoso shall offer Me in faith and love
A leaf, a flower, a fruit, w ater poured
forth,
T hat offering I accept, lovingly made
W ith pious will. W hate’er thou doest,
Eating or sacrificing, giving gifts,
Praying or fasting, let it all be done
For Me, as Mine.
However men approach Me,
Even so 1 accept them ,
For the paths men take from every side
Are Mine.
They are in Me, and I in them .2
1
Wisdom: Thus taught Shri Krishna, Lord
of Devotion, and to reverence in Devotion the
Grace of the St a r ,
Congregation : My faith 1 pledge.
Love : Once again He came to us, our Lord
and M aster. In Palestine He bade His holy
disciple Jesus prepare for Him a habitation;
and when the disciple Jesus was thirty years
2
18
old, he offered his body to the Lord, and the
Lord taught in the body of Jesus for three
years as Christ the Anointed.
W ith arms outstretehed in love, He called :
“ Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are
heavy laden, and I will give you r e s t; take
m y yoke upon you, and learn of M e; fo r I am
m eek and lowly in h e a rt: and ye shall fin d
rest unto your souls. For m y yoke is easy,
and m y burden is light.”2
2
He taught us to serve one another, even as
(< y
He served us, saying, He that is greatest
among you shall be your servant ” 23; and He
taught us to love one another, saying, “ This
is My com m andm ent, th at ye love one another,
as 1 have loved you. G reater love hath no
man than this, that a man lay down his life for
his friends.” 2
4
Love: So taught Christ, Lord of Love, and
to reverence in Service the LOVE of the STAR,
Congregation: My faith 1 pledge.
Power : No more eame our Lord and M aster
H im self to teaeh us the W A Y of the STAR .
Y et did He send forth His diseiples to teaeh
that W A Y. To Arabia He sent Muhammad,
the Prophet of God, to teaeh Islam, Submission
to God’s Will, and to train all who accepted
19
the Prophet to live and aet as brothers
without distinction of wealth or poverty,
birth or breeding. To India He sent Nanak
the Master, to teaeh all the Sikhs or disciples
to transcend the lim itations of birth and
caste and be brothers, even as the diseiples
of one Master.
Announcements are made here and a brief
address is giYen.
THE INVOCATION

RECESSIONAL
I
Lord, from Thine all-strengthening Presence,
Gifts of peace we take aw ay ;
Shedding where the darkness fastens,
Light from W isdom’s brightening ray.
We, Thy children, pledge our duty,
H eart and hand for service true.
T each us, Lord, to read Thy message,
W rit on each faith’s m ystic page ;
Till Thy T ru th ’s increasing glory
Guides m ankind from age to age.
We, Thy children, pledge our duty,
H eart and hand for service true.
.Joyful we adore Thy Splendour,
Of Thy Beauty nature tells ;
Always Thou art nearest to us,
W hen in each heart pity dwells.
We, Thy children, pledge our duty,
H eart and hand for service true.
29
Strong and tender, pure and holy,
May we grow by Thy Love’s aid ;
Each for all, as Thou dost teach us,
Swiftly in Thy pattern made.
We, Thy children, pledge our duty,.
H eart and hand for service true.

O M aster! when Thou callest,
No voice m ay say Thee nay,
For blest are they that follow
W here Thou dost lead the w ay ;
In freshest prim e of morning,
O r fullest glow of noon,
The note of heavenly warning
Can never come too soon.
O M aster! where Thou callest,
No foot may shrink in fear,
For they who tru st Thee wholly-
Shall find Thee ever near ;
And cham ber still and lonely,
O r busy harvest-field,
W here Thou, Lord, rulest only.
Shall precious produce yield.
30
O M aster ! whom Thou eallest,
No heart may dare refuse ;
’Tis honour, highest honour,
W hen Thou dost deign to use ;
•Our brightest and our fairest,
O ur dearest—all are Thine ;
T hou who for each one earest,
We hail Thy love’s design.
T hey who go forth to serve Thee,
We too who serve at home,
May watch and pray together
Until Thy kingdom come ;
In Thee for aye united,
O ur song of hope we raise,
Till th at blest shore is sighted
W here all shall tu rn to praise.

3 This is developed out of a serm on of the Lord
Buddha, The H indus offer daily five sacrifices—to
Devas (angels), Rishis (saints), Pitris (ancestors),
M anushyas (men), B hutas (minor invisible entities and
anim als). The Buddha instructed th a t a better form
of sacrifice is to offer thoughts of friendship and
gratitude to the “ six quarters ”. Edwin Arnold in his
Light of Asia, Book V III, quotes the serm on. I have
used his words, except for “ E arth ” and “ Heaven ” .

26This Invocation is a modified form of the Invocation
composed by Dr. Annie Besant, and offered by her
for the first tim e at the conclusion of her lecture,
“ The W hite Lodge and its M essengers ” , on Jan u ary 1,
1911. In her Invocation, the congregation looked
forw ard to the Coming of the Lord. I have modified
the Invocation so as to show th at the Lord is with us
invisibly, and is “ come ” to those who live and work
for Him and in His Name.
27These verses are quoted in A t the F eet of the
