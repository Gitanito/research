It was a terrible accident but nothing severe happened to me because of it, despite my having hit my head.  

All I can remember is that I saw myself lying on the street. I think that I also saw myself sitting there looking for something, and then passing out. I have this weird feeling associated with seeing myself from outside of my body for a few seconds and then being back within my body!
