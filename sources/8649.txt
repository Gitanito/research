Experience description: &nbsp;               I  have been remembering my own personal afterlife experiences since 1998.&nbsp;   It is bizarre that the memories where not always with my conscious mind.&nbsp;   I have been pouring over the missing information the last year and a  half.&nbsp;  I try to study various themes  for myself.&nbsp;  It is amazing to recall  them with accurate details.&nbsp;  Often  times, there are no words to describe the actual experience.&nbsp;   I have tried to explain this many times in my past [my afterlife  experiences.]&nbsp;&nbsp;  People's  perception within a religious belief -- always got in the way.

&nbsp;But  -- that is a theme that is running though out all of my experiences.&nbsp;   Like you described in your article .. soul mate has many various worldly  definitions.&nbsp;  You mention &quot;twin  flame&quot; which I am vaguely familiar with.&nbsp;   The one theme in my afterlife experiences, [that I have not seen in Other  accounts,]&nbsp;  is the &quot;Twin  Mate.&quot; I have read a different definition of Twin Flame. Plato did mention  it in his writings back around 400 BC.&nbsp;

&nbsp;But  this is what I have a memory of that runs the whole course of my life.

&nbsp;I&nbsp;   have always remembered being in &quot;Heaven&quot; before the descent  into the physical form.&nbsp;  There was  someone there with me. (Spirit.)&nbsp;  There  was an immense amount of love and energy flowing though us.&nbsp;   We were being separated to come into the world in two different forms.  (Physical     bodies.)&nbsp;  ( I have often said --  that if I cried as a baby -- that was why I was crying. I was missing my twin.)

I have also  gained access to my childhood years and the memories that where stored away in  the subconscious.&nbsp;  I grew up talking  about &quot;my twin.&quot;&nbsp;  My  physical parents thought I was living out thoughts of imagination.&nbsp;   I kept asking about my twin.&nbsp;  I  often spoke of coming to this world and splitting from my twin.&nbsp;   They could not understand where I came up with this concept.

At the age of  13 -- I had a very spiritual vision where I was &quot;spiritually joined&quot;  with this twin.&nbsp;  Call it a  &quot;holy marriage.&quot;&nbsp;  It was  not done in a physical aspect.&nbsp;  When  this happened -- it was much like a near-death experience.&nbsp;   It was an out of body experience in another realm of reality.&nbsp;   When I came back, -- I told one of my parents, &quot;My angel wears a  body just like me.&nbsp;  My angel has skin too.&quot;&nbsp;   My angel is what I always referred to as the one who spoke to me  telepathically and stated they where my constant &quot;spiritual  companion.&quot;

Now that I  have hindsight, -- the angel was also the &quot;twin&quot; who communicated with  me telepathically within.&nbsp;  My  afterlife experiences carry a theme of this &quot;spiritual twinship.&quot;     </body>
