  		              		Experience Description   

    I was attacked by my husband's ex-wife. She stands 6 feet tall and 180 pounds. I am a small petite woman 5'4 115lbs.    I was strangled for nearly 2 minutes and had my skull bashed to a car and cement floor.    While she was on top of me strangling me, I left my body. I saw myself walking down a damp dark tunnel looking confused so I moved towards lift and away from darkness down through the tunnel.    I remember hearing AMY, AMY AMY and I turned away from the light back the darkness and bam I was back in my body.    My husband was yelling my name. He says he remembers yelling AMY AMY AMY!!!!! I remember hearing it.    But we oddly have a recording of his wife attacking me, coparenting drama and I was not comfortable and we had just started working with a new therapist for my step daughter. Long story short I recorded their conversation not knowing I would capture myself being attacked.    Nowhere on the audio of my attack is my husband yelling AMY AMY AMY. We were dumbfounded. It's the one very distinct memory we both had.    For months I felt like I didn't fit in my body. Like you don't fit in the same way. Like new shoes that are a little tight, a little not comfortable.    I have such a different outlook on what happens to us after we die after this. I left my body and walked away as if nothing had happened.    I felt to calm and at peace for an extended period of time after oddly because the nature of my life-threatening experience was so violent.    But I truly miss that feeling it was like nothing I can describe pure bliss peace calm.
