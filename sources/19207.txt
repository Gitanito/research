hi Dr Greer good afternoon hello
everybody and thank you Pat for joining
me how are you
good swamp busy a big announcement to
make for everyone
um you know now that we&#39;re in the middle
of uh January and past the new year and
holidays a couple days before Christmas
the pre the Congress passed and the
president signed the National Defense
authorization act which is the funding
bill for the Pentagon for the next year
in it is a clear provision
for UFO whistleblowers
and witnesses to come forward
through a protected mechanism where they
can legally share everything they know
in any materials documents anything they
have
and that is an enormous breakthrough and
so this whole YouTube
today
is about making a call and an appeal for
courageous people to come forward
because now they&#39;re protected they have
a legal mechanism there&#39;s no gray area
and it includes importantly
which was not originally in the draft
which which we wanted in
our contractors so people who work for
Lockheed Skunk Works people who worked
for other defense contractors or Tech
contractors
um who are in the private sector
if it came through of any government
funding or contractor for the military
intelligence Community as well as
government uh military and intelligence
employees or former employees retired or
current they can now come forward fully
protected for their non-disclosure
agreements through this specific
provision so that is the first time in
history that&#39;s been authorized and I
think that door is wide open right now
and we should walk through it with
everything we can so what I&#39;d like for
everyone listening to listen very
carefully
the process
for doing this
we have at our website there&#39;s you can
go to info at
seriousdisclosure.com
s-i-r-i-u-s
disclosure.com so info
cirrusdisclosure.com that will get to me
we will handle you very confidentially
as we have hundreds of these uh
whistleblowers in the past 25 years
and
what we&#39;re doing is taking
people like that we&#39;re going to do it
soon with one
taking them over
to the top people
that are cleared
word code code you know code word
clearance tssa top secret special
compartment information to take them
into a secure place and get their
information so that the constitutional
government in the United States that had
been deceived on this and not been given
information can find out and get to the
bottom
of the entire issue
so this is a major initiative we want
people to contact us soon
and uh I will handle those folks with
very high level of confidentiality
great now is this a permanent
permanent right they can&#39;t
and they says well of course every
Congress can write a bill that
supersedes in another one happens every
day
which like I said
a door is open wide open now who knows
in a year or two
so I think
we should seize the day
right okay
momentous
it is and
the little history here
um
over
OS
30 years
from briefing director of the CIA to
meeting with members of the Senate and
House Pentagon others here and abroad
there was never a legal mechanism for
any government to get to the bottom of
this for people who had this level of
clearance and the people who
courageously came forward with the
disclosure project and the national
Press Club event in 2001 did it based on
a different mechanism
now both are in play
what was the first mechanism
first mechanism is that we wrote in 1997
25 years ago what&#39;s called A unod letter
unless otherwise directed and my
military advisor said hey Dr Greer
here&#39;s something that&#39;s done all the
time you write an assessment to the key
agencies and the heads of various
Departments of the government that says
unless otherwise directed this is our
assessment of a situation and our
assessment was by then we could prove
legally
that these deep black projects running
the UFO issue were unconstitutional and
illegal and we&#39;re outside the oversight
of the president the CIA director I
briefed and senior members of the
Congress I had met with including back
then members of the Senate intelligence
committee Who oversee all this allegedly
but worked and we had also through
meetings proven that the head of the
defense intelligence agency and Admiral
Wilson the head of intelligence joint
staff were also being denied access
being deceived and threatened
by this Rogue thuggish group based on
that we said because of this
all national security Oaths and
non-disclosure agreements are null and
void because the underlying program that
they&#39;ve been in even though they didn&#39;t
know it is being run outside the law
against the law itself
now from 1997 to now no one in the U.S
government has contradicted that
assessment and the way this works is
once it&#39;s sent and it was signed and
receded and sent back to us if they
don&#39;t intervene we put I think we put 90
days on it
which would have been 25 years ago early
1998 then you can proceed
this mechanism is very
nicely done and that&#39;s how I got the
first group of disclosure Witnesses
about 100 of them that you see in the
disclosure book and at the national
Press Club 20 of them were there
well
those men and women
were convinced that that was true so
they courageously came forward now we
have that in place plus an officially
sanctioned law
for people to come forward so now
there&#39;s no excuse
we we have a door wide open
I&#39;ve been working with the people who
have been Central to creating that
um
and
I personally hand off
the information and
the Personnel so if someone comes to me
I will meet with them and then bring
them to where they&#39;re then taken into a
secure
uh compartmented information facility
skiff
or
The Vault it&#39;s called The Vault and they
can share everything
and the people they&#39;re speaking to have
the highest clearance to receive
everything and these guys you&#39;re on
working with them they&#39;re the real thing
they&#39;re honest they&#39;re courageous
they&#39;re in the constitutional government
they respect the rule of law
and they&#39;re wanting to go the whole
distance on it so both key members of of
the government Congress elected but
these people who are really the main
investigators
they&#39;re all the real thing now there&#39;s
an office called Arrow aaro
that
um
is also
uh receiving
testimony but that would be
uh after these key people have are sure
that they&#39;ve documented the information
so that that office of the Aero office
from the Pentagon doesn&#39;t just bury
their testimony so we have a check and
balance in place
watchdog
so
that&#39;s what we want people to understand
and I will personally handle folks who
have that information now what we don&#39;t
want
Please don&#39;t slam us
with conspiracy theories or rumors or a
fourth hand I heard but we do need to
know if either if you yourself or
someone you know
is a first hand
uh person who may have been in a
facility worked on a project been at a
UFO event reverse engineered ET craft
including documents because this allows
a mechanism for documentation that such
whistleblowers may have to be brought in
and for that matter of materiel if
someone had actual physical material
from a craft or what have you so all of
this mechanism is going we think that we
have uh really want to in the next six
months get that process
um
fully stood up
and it&#39;s very exciting and
people will be protected and people will
be
confidential now eventually it&#39;d be nice
that some people who are willing would
come publicly forward outside of this
mechanism
because we&#39;re planning in late may we
haven&#39;t said it yet to have another
National Press Club event
sort of a big bigger version of the
disclosure project in 2001
um but that is very much been on
people&#39;s
stomach for being publicly identified
you don&#39;t have to be publicly identified
for what I&#39;m talking about you can be
completely Anonymous to the public
confidential
and uh provide the information
excuse me
so
that to me is a patriotic Duty I mean if
you if you have worked as a contractor
or a government military or intelligence
person
and there&#39;s now you now know
as do some key people in the government
that there&#39;s been an extra legal illegal
uh unconstitutional project managing
this issue for well since at least the
late 50s
that you now have a patriotic duty to
come forward why because if we don&#39;t
have the rule of law
and we don&#39;t have people coming forward
with the courage to let
the people we do elect in a point then
we&#39;re back to the Jungle we&#39;re seating
we&#39;re seating this entire issue and for
really the future of the planet
two thugs and criminals I&#39;ll be very
blunt that&#39;s what those groups are and
they know it by the way these guys in
those groups know that they have been
operating outside the law
and since I&#39;ve been able to prove that
since the late 90s
that took me about 10 years to prove it
from early 90s to late 90s I spent a lot
of time meeting with people who if this
was being overseen properly definitely
would have known about it
the president&#39;s people CI directed
people I mean those people you cannot
say that you&#39;re running a project
legally when you are deceiving lying to
and also embezzling over the years
trillions of dollars
that have gone into these reverse
engineering programs and UFO related
research projects without the knowledge
and consent of the legally appointed and
elected government of the United States
you cannot have it both ways
so that&#39;s the case now most people men
and women who&#39;ve been in these projects
they&#39;ve sort of are you know involved in
one little area they&#39;re not in the top
of the management they assume that it&#39;s
being overseen every single uh
disclosure witness I&#39;ve had
assumed when they were working the issue
that through the chain of command and
the legal constitutional system that
that was being run properly it is it was
not and that was the big Discovery we
made in the 90s now
interestingly key people in the
government now have discovered that is
absolutely true and so this is why we
have
uh I think a moral and ethical
obligation to come forward
um at least Through This Confidential
mechanism so that the people who are
sincere trying to get to the bottom of
this on behalf of the US government and
the people the United States do so and
uh I think that in the best case
scenario some of these that will come
forward will actually come forward
publicly for the public in the media but
that it&#39;s not a requirement I want to
emphasize that&#39;s the ideal but it&#39;s not
required no one needs to feel like they
have to be publicly out there in order
to give us a contact us so again it&#39;s
info at
seriousdisclosure.com so everyone please
post that on all your social media link
to this YouTube and let people know that
this is literally in 70 years probably
well not probably definitely the biggest
um
has the most potential for ending this
illegal secrecy and moving the subject
forward and solving the problem because
ultimately if it isn&#39;t solved at a large
level
peace in the world the technologies that
need to come out you know everyone knows
we&#39;re doing the Lost Century uh
documentary about the technologies have
been kept secret for 100 years
and you can help support the
crowdfunding there at the wall
centuryfilm.com
and that&#39;s plant we&#39;re planning to have
that come out in late may now so I think
that it if all goes well the tech
platforms are now requiring like 120
days from the time you deliver it to the
time it comes out they&#39;ve extended it by
almost double recently so
um but we&#39;re looking at late May
hopefully but the reason that&#39;s
important is that then the public will
be aware of what the stakes are because
it&#39;s not just the rule of law which is
big enough
it&#39;s water what are they keeping secret
what&#39;s so important that they would do
these illegal unconstitutional actions
well it&#39;s the corrupt the collusion and
Corruption between big and Industrial
and financial interests
and covert programs to protect
Financial interests and cartels
because hey
how we say look at the Tic Tac look at
how that UFO&#39;s moving
not there&#39;s no oil on board there&#39;s no
Rockets there&#39;s no solid Rockets there&#39;s
no nuclear power plant it&#39;s an
electromagnetic field propulsion it&#39;s
pulling energy from the fabric of the
space-time around at zero point and it&#39;s
moving now those Technologies apply to
Peaceful energy use
would completely save the biosphere and
end poverty on the planet within 20
years maybe less
so this is a great consequence to the
future of humanity and to our planet
and then on top of it once this issue
can get disclosed properly there&#39;s a
chance that the leaders around the world
figure whoa we&#39;re not alone who&#39;s mining
that store
who&#39;s taking care of that relationship
now the ce5 contact Community is doing
this as citizen diplomats but ultimately
leaders of the world need to look at
this and realize that the worst case
scenario is what&#39;s happening now and
that is criminally minded Thugs who are
in this military-industrial illegal
group
are the ones firing at and and damaging
the potential relationship between
humans and extraterrestrial
civilizations
that&#39;s ultimately the biggest threat of
all of this even probably more dangerous
immediately than the biosphere and the
environment being damaged
not all those issues have to be
addressed is why we&#39;ve been doing both
the ce5 contact effort and the
disclosure project and the work on these
Technologies for you know 30 years but
here&#39;s a mechanism that all we you know
I ask people for their you know thoughts
and prayers as we we do this because
obviously you know it&#39;s the some risk
personally to myself but I think that we
have to we have to move forward uh like
I said maybe in a year or two
they closed that door somebody changes
that wall and closes it there&#39;s you
cannot guarantee it when you&#39;re dealing
with politics and in politics it can
also be corrupting influences so right
now this is a huge achievement big
breakthrough
and we&#39;re asking for everyone&#39;s support
you feel like more and more people in
the American government are more and
more of the lawmakers and politicians do
you feel like they are beginning
to understand this and learn about it I
mean it&#39;s been a small group that you&#39;re
working with but do you feel like that&#39;s
growing
excuse me oh definitely I mean what
what I know
is not what I think it&#39;s what I know
is that enough information
that we put together in the last year
has been provided to key people and now
they&#39;re a dog with a bone they&#39;re like
well there&#39;s something here
and they want to get to the bottom of it
and I think
for that to happen
they need more and more first-hand
people
you know remember listen everyone all
the conspiracy theories understanding
I&#39;m a retired emergency doctor I&#39;ve
never gotten an Indian head nickel from
a corporation
or the government I&#39;ve never worked for
anyone doing this has all been a
volunteer effort the entire disclosure
project has been funded through
donations and volunteers
but
at the same time we&#39;ve collected so much
information
that we&#39;re now in possession of the
largest intelligence
archive in the world on this and so
that&#39;s the other thing we&#39;re working on
we need help here and so here&#39;s uh a
request number two
we&#39;re working on
putting together
uh finishing this archive in the next
few months
and we hope it can be released and
announced to the whole world at a
national Press Club event in late may
now
I bet you know stuff sitting on a 10
terabyte hard drive
doesn&#39;t help the world much
we need probably one of the best website
designers who knows Security in the
world
to help us build a website
that is I don&#39;t know technology this way
blockchain or whatever backed up that
can hold five to ten terabytes
a huge amount of material totally
searchable word searchable
that we would load into the
internet
so that everyone in the media and in
governments around the world and the man
on the street public would have access
to everything we have except names I
need to protect the only thing we&#39;re
going to redact
the full disclosure if someone&#39;s come to
me and and I have their information and
they&#39;re wanting it to be kept but just
private or only conveyed to these key
people in the government I&#39;m not going
to ever violate that trust so that that
will not be in there for people who just
are you know wanting salacious gossip
but um because that is unethical and as
a medical doctor we know how to keep a
confidence but everything else documents
uh something like
119 retrieval cases of E.T and some
man-made UFOs we have all the data on
that the where the when the location of
all the facilities how this is funded
this is going to be the biggest
reference
site in history for this subject
and to make that available to the public
two things we&#39;re going to need funding
for it and secondly we&#39;re going to need
someone who technically knows how to do
that which as you know Pat I can&#39;t even
turn my my wife turns my computer on for
me I&#39;m sort of I&#39;m an I.T for sure
but um we do need help with that so if
anyone knows someone who can do it
either
pro bono or inexpensively because right
now we don&#39;t have a budget for this
we&#39;re just doing it like even these
people are moving in to DC who are top
secret guys uh we&#39;re funding the
disclosure project is funding and all
this because we want to be sure that
this is handled very carefully so uh
that&#39;s another thing we need is people
who can support this uh the cause I
estimate in the next year we&#39;ll probably
spend around 250 000 doing all this but
you know someone who can help please
help but
that&#39;s
um
going to be a big task because to make a
functional
safe secure website with that much
content
it&#39;s big yeah a lot
it can be done they can be done
um a question
when you were talking about other
countries and other governments who were
who are obviously watching this closely
at this point I&#39;m sure oh yeah have they
reached out what do they have anything
in place
so the people in their country excuse me
yes oh yeah I mean I know people who yes
people from Canada and other countries
have reached out to me
um the thing is is that the United
States is is from a global economic and
Military and National Security point of
view is like the 800 pound gorilla on
the Block and I know years ago I was
meeting with a cabinet level person from
Japan
and when I mentioned I said look you
know this is stalled out with the
president no one in Congress is pursuing
this why don&#39;t you what isn&#39;t your
government
take the lead on this because I&#39;ll give
you guys everything too because I don&#39;t
have a security clearance I can share
what I have with anyone in the world
I&#39;ve kept myself free of ever signing a
non-disclosure agreement
so I&#39;m a free agent he and he turned
white pale he said oh no we can never
get out ahead of the us on this ever
we never would never and he was just
like panic but the idea of it so I think
that
in reality I mean most Americans don&#39;t
realize that you know it it it the
center of gravity on Military
Intelligence economic Financial is in
the United States whether we like it or
not uh now it doesn&#39;t mean honestly
there could be other countries and I&#39;ve
said this for years that if there were
other presidents or prime ministers or
governments around the world they really
wanted to get to the bottom of this we
hand off everything we have and they
start pursuing it they could actually
Advance this very far but they&#39;d have to
do it they&#39;re usually very afraid of
stepping out ahead of what the U.S
government&#39;s doing
because of the the power and
intimidation of America I hate to say it
but I mean it&#39;s just
Geo reality geopolit politics
so uh I would welcome that if someone&#39;s
got a very high contact if someone wants
to pursue it I&#39;ll fly it or do anything
you know my whole mission is getting the
truth out resolving this problem and by
the way let&#39;s move on to where we should
have been in 1954 or something you know
let&#39;s let&#39;s go let&#39;s move this on since
you know we&#39;ve frittered away a century
here but um so that is something I
welcome
but so far no one&#39;s there have been
inquiries but no one really wanted to
take the bull by the horns and do it
do you think any of these other
governments uh will sign bills and put
out legislation like we have with this
whistleblower the NDA we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll
see I haven&#39;t
heard anything
there&#39;s some talk in Canada
we&#39;ll see and too good Paul Hellyer is
not still around yes
oh man uh well this is interesting
um just to be clear about this other one
point
um this aaro this would not be the first
stop for someone who wants to come
forward right uh
they&#39;d like it to be yeah I&#39;m sure but
we have a system in place above that and
more
let&#39;s just say I think that&#39;s much more
credibility
power
and um
dedication to the truth
I&#39;ve worked
with those people for a year
giving them a huge amount of information
now I think there are some good people
in in Arrow who would like to but most
of them have only been involved maybe
six months they know nothing about the
subject as you saw last spring during
those hearings there were Congress
people who knew about the cases we&#39;d
brought forward about the UFO&#39;s concern
about our nuclear
like Minot North Dakota
in the disclosure book
and the guys in that office knew nothing
about it I mean this is Austin Naval
intelligence guy Bray and this guy so
they really
um need uh help and guidance but we&#39;re
also concerned about the politics of
those folks who are in the military end
of it
could get pressure to get information
and then bury it I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s
what they&#39;re going to do but these are
facts not in evidence as a lawyer would
say so I we have the system to be sure
that can&#39;t happen
because these key people in in the US
government will know everything
these whistleblowers are sharing
at the just before they&#39;re handed over
and given information over to Arrow so I
and that&#39;s a very important check in
Balance because we know what has
happened in the past where you set up an
office it becomes a storefront sort of a
dog and pony show and stuff goes in
nothing ever comes out
so we want to be sure that doesn&#39;t
happen this time
right I think
I want to talk
and we&#39;re answering really new but we&#39;re
keeping it a secret but what you&#39;re
saying is really most of them don&#39;t know
at all it didn&#39;t they don&#39;t
it&#39;s sad so one of the saddest things
I&#39;ve learned 30 years ago in 93
was that
some of these people you think oh it&#39;s
this person and that person and they
haven&#39;t all access passed
top secret clearances in a very high
position
they&#39;re not given any information
and unfortunately that&#39;s the structure
of the secrecy it keeps them into dark
so I have sympathy for that but at the
same time I know historically
once someone starts going down this path
there&#39;s intimidation there&#39;s threats
there&#39;s corruption
there&#39;s career threats and things go
sideways
over the past year I&#39;ve found that this
team that&#39;s really leading this and
trying to get all this done or have the
most incredible integrity
I&#39;ve been singularly impressed and I&#39;m
not impressed easily by that kind of
thing frankly because you know you you
it&#39;s the fire test and they&#39;ve been
under Fire
and they&#39;re still fighting the good
fight so
um it&#39;s it&#39;s a very uh important
initiative
certainly in my 33 years of doing I have
seen nothing this promising and now that
this law is enshrined I recently had a
man contact me
who had been watching what we&#39;ve been
doing for over 20 years very code level
word code level
um
tssei top secret special compartment
intelligence dealing with this issue and
he says I was waiting for this moment
been waiting for a mechanism the law
that lets me do this
and that&#39;s happening
and actually it&#39;s soon going to be
handed off
that all that information and this
person so
it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s I think people out there
need to share this information
and our
info at seriousdisclosure.com
with everyone because you never know Six
Degrees of Separation right someone you
know that knows someone else that knows
someone else
boom there&#39;s someone who worked at
Raytheon or someone who worked at Nellis
or
Wright-Patterson
Edwards
they&#39;re all over the place
right now it&#39;s time for them
come together
come together what happens after what
happens after these groups gather this
intelligence
that&#39;s about these covert uh operations
what happens then excuse me here&#39;s what
I think
it&#39;s impossible to predict great
question
ultimately what will
the National Security Council the
president and the leaders in the
Congress do because that&#39;s where the
book stops right there
right it stops there
because that&#39;s the Constitutional
elected and appointed government
um and that has to do with
their understanding
and their courage and vision
so they need to understand the issues
which they don&#39;t fully yet
and they have to have the courage to do
the right thing in the face of enormous
pressure not to
so this gets into the whole Quest the
issue I I said this decades ago this all
comes down to someone&#39;s courage to do
the right thing
whether it is benefits you selfishly and
personally or politically or financially
or not
um and that&#39;s a tough thing for humans I
mean obviously but it has to do with
values and integrity and courage and so
that&#39;s hard to predict now the backstop
is what we&#39;re doing disclosure project
because I know who everyone is and I
know what everyone knows and we&#39;ll see
at the end of May
who&#39;s been naughty and nice and
depending on how things go
it&#39;ll depend that will drive how much I
disclose and don&#39;t disclose
if there&#39;s no forward momentum or some
corrupt interest stops this the world&#39;s
going to be in for an enormous shock
s yeah
yeah yeah then then the whole the full
monty happens but you know my hope is
that now
I think this is a process of a year or
two I mean you know that first of all if
you&#39;re starting with homeless no
information
except what you&#39;ve Googled on the
internet 90 of which is rubbish
what are you gonna do so what if you&#39;re
the chairman of a key committee
if you&#39;ve been denied
information you have been not read into
or briefed on it then you&#39;ve got to
learn all the way back from the 40s to
now you have to learn what they have
where they have it
why it&#39;s been kept secret how has kept
being kept secret how have they gotten
the money
and we&#39;re doing all that in this
intelligence archive that we&#39;re handing
off because
without that it makes no sense
you know what how could a clandestine
operation be running off the radar
since the 50s
but it has
but see that statement right there takes
months
and and when I&#39;ve worked with these
folks for them to get their mind around
that level of manipulation machinations
corruption
and most people unfortunately don&#39;t
think that that level of corruption
could exist
uh in covert programs either corporate
or government but it does
and that is very disappointing and very
heartbreaking but also scary
and I call you know I coined the term
disclosure PTSD
with the these while these guys have
been dealing with for the last year they
have a type of post-traumatic stress
disorder from learning all this because
now they know it&#39;s true it&#39;s I because
I&#39;d be giving them enough information
and get inside places and inside Skiffs
and inside basis and so it&#39;s your whole
world flips upside down
I was talking to someone late last night
about 2 A.M about this
um because it&#39;s just your whole Paradigm
is shaken and that&#39;s hard I mean if
you&#39;re a conventional politician or
bureaucrat or whatever or president even
that is just a shocking to the system so
we also have to be patient about
the process
right well some of these ones who are
being more vocal that they want
they they know they&#39;re not they&#39;re not
told they know they&#39;re not being allowed
to have the information and they&#39;re
becoming more vocal have any of them
reached back out to you to ask any
questions
yes
and I will provide everything I can the
only thing for example if I&#39;m working
with very senior people who are
sensitive don&#39;t be identified to someone
who&#39;s not their immediate
chairman of committee or whatever I&#39;m
not going to tell another Congressman
exactly who that is but I&#39;ll talk with
the process and what&#39;s going on
one of them
you know a lot of them think
members of their own party are lying to
them when in reality the senior people
in that same party don&#39;t know anything
because if you&#39;re say new to Congress
there&#39;s a there&#39;s a congressman who&#39;s
freestyle who&#39;s spoken publicly about
this recently uh uh Burchette from
Tennessee
and and he&#39;s he&#39;s rightly upset that
this is secret and that there&#39;s anything
classified about it
but I think many times those people will
think gee
there are people who are hiding this
from me well they can&#39;t hide what they
don&#39;t know
right
so this is this is the hardest thing for
people to get their minds around I think
in my 30 years doing this
understanding the nature of the secrecy
that it&#39;s so deep and so secret that
people that everyone if you ask a
thousand people on the street
do you think this person the DCI
director or this person the chairman of
a key oversight Committee in the Senate
would no be read into and know all this
most people say oh yeah of course
they don&#39;t and that when I discovered
that in 1993 that flipped my world
upside down honestly because I went what
just through the Looking Glass this
cannot be
and so I&#39;m very compassionate I know
what kind of
um how upsetting that was to me because
it wasn&#39;t like you know people sit on
the computers in Endless nonsense can be
conspiracy theories but when you&#39;re
actually sitting there briefing a CI
director or a member of the Senate
intelligence committee who by the way
the one I wanted them I briefed was the
senator for uh
Nevada
where nellises and Area 51 and he had
never been told anything
and he was on the intelligence Committee
of the Senate back then Brian
and I met with him at a secret room
inside McCarran airport in Las Vegas
years ago and he was just flat-footed he
said I can&#39;t so this is look everyone
puts their their pants on one leg at a
time and everyone have these sort of
like grandiose ideas
and
we have to understand uh that there are
people who&#39;ve been at the Congress and
the White House who have deceived each
other
but most of them know nothing
99 Problems
but the ones who do they&#39;re there to
deceive and to interrupt and stop
progress
in other words they&#39;re corrupt
I know who those are too time to talk
about it but
so this disclosure of all this when you
talk about PTSD disclosure
the general public
um some who follow you and follow this
subject matter know a lot about this I
mean they they probably know more about
some of the people on the hill for sure
oh yes the vast majority of people may
not know about this and to them this may
sound like science fiction or or
conspiracy theory
um I think this this will be hard for
them some of them to really believe or
wrap their heads around some of this so
and it is and this is why
excuse me the briefing materials have to
be
graduated
so you know they&#39;re like in in modules
or you know step one step two step five
step twenty you cannot you can&#39;t take
someone from kindergarten who&#39;s adding
one and one is two to calculus
it doesn&#39;t work and so this is why I
talk about this process having to be
very well thought through also
compassionate
um and uh with it structured so that you
don&#39;t if you try to go too far too fast
you leave them they just go this can&#39;t
be so it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very hard thing
for me to balance because from where I
sit
because I&#39;ve lived with this for so much
my life now
I mean I&#39;m 67 I&#39;ve been doing this for
33 years it&#39;s half my biological life
um I think that you know I have to
understand that someone just learning
this it doesn&#39;t matter what their Rank
and position is or scientific
credentials you have to understand that
they have to be uh brought along and
frankly the public Center have to be
brought along that way
um which is why we started doing things
like unacknowledged and the disclosure
project press conference and the books
now honestly anyone who&#39;d look at
unacknowledged read the book and
acknowledge
I I guarantee you know more about this
issue than any chairman of any Committee
in the U.S Congress
or National Security Council staff
that&#39;s true but they&#39;re busy with a
million other issues right you look at
everything going on in the world uh and
they&#39;re pulled in a thousand directions
and there&#39;s only so many hours in the
day and so you have to be able to put
things in a very succinct way that makes
the point and most importantly again
your whistleblowers who know credible
prove who they were
they go in and it&#39;s not coming from a
retired doctor
who who&#39;s never been in the government
it&#39;s coming from the horse&#39;s mouth
because I all I can do is help set up
the meat and and
advise and put this information together
but ultimately the reason these this
whistleblower law is so important
they have the power they have clearances
they were there you know
I know what I know from having
over
I&#39;d say over a thousand
people who&#39;ve been involved with these
projects that I&#39;ve met with and
discussed this with over the years but
that&#39;s second hand the first hand
knowledge people who actually work the
system
foreign
are in the system were in the system
even if they were in the system 40 years
ago very important
so we want them to come forward
right it&#39;s very important I know you&#39;ve
mentioned this before for the general
public
um and in something like this even some
of the people in the government who are
trying to find information
using the same tools that the general
public would be using like the internet
and we&#39;ve talked about this before the
black hole of disinformation it is so
easy to get diverted right into that
um oh yeah
I mean how do you how do you caution
people about this
you inoculate them in advance
I tell them
most of what you&#39;re going to encounter
is some form of fantasy disinformation
spin half truth
which is why this archive that has very
specific information
documents testimony of people who have
come forward
Etc
um
scientific information that is going to
be important for the public for our
leaders and
for policy makers
so it sort of needs to become the
reference material and by the way anyone
out there who&#39;s got material like that
that they want us to review to be part
of this
please get hold of us because Michael
schrat is working with me to create
that vast
intelligence and information archive and
every month or so we get another whole
group of documents or information that
we&#39;re getting through networking so you
know don&#39;t assume that anything you have
is trip unimportant
if it&#39;s a legitimate case witness
government document corporate document
all this is very very important and
yeah they&#39;re all being scanned in you
know work word searchable PDF
right you&#39;ve said before that some
people may
their the
very small one but you&#39;ve tried to make
this clear that you know these are all
little pieces of the of the puzzle
well this is why I tell people I started
out
having had contact
and I started out with Excuse me a
little bit of information
and then more and another and another
and another it&#39;s like a million pieces
of a puzzle
that we&#39;re assembling and each piece has
come from this source that Source what
have you now the hard part of this is
really what&#39;s called intelligence
analysis which is really what my kind of
specialty of this is and that&#39;s
connecting all those dots so you know
where that puzzle piece fits but just
because someone has some little part of
the puzzle it may be something that then
lights up a whole part of that picture
does this make sense
very important so people should not
think we&#39;re not it&#39;s very unlikely that
someone at the very top of this
organization this covert organization is
going to come in with the Holy Grail of
everything
the way we&#39;ve assembled it so far is Bit
by Bit by Bit by Bit by Bit
painstakingly uh which is 30 years of
work but that&#39;s why people should not
undersell themselves because whatever
bit you know or experience or saw or
this document or this information you
had about this place that may we I will
be able to plug that in and go ah that
fills in this missing blank see what I&#39;m
saying
yeah and that&#39;s that&#39;s really the hard
work of this
you know it&#39;s it&#39;s not you don&#39;t wave a
magic wand and get this entire because
you&#39;re really pulling back layer after
layer after layer after layer of the
secrecy over 70 years of it
yeah it goes back right away
oh well it&#39;s a World War II
we&#39;re in 70 years
so
well this is
it&#39;s exciting um we need help so we need
help with people building this site
Internet site that would be the
reference
of all reference Bibles as it were for
this issue we need people to help fund
these disclosure events in 2023 we need
top secret and other corporate military
witnesses to come forward
so
put the word out thank you guys I mean
you know you know Pat you&#39;ve done a
great job helping get the word out but
we need everyone you know take this
YouTube interview
around my farm in Virginia and just put
it everywhere you can link it everywhere
everyone is listening and you know we
have almost half a million subscribers
now on our YouTube channel but we need
that to be you know 10 million or
something in terms of the reach this
message because now is the door opened
uh it&#39;s it&#39;s an opportunity we don&#39;t
want to squander it&#39;s a great
opportunity
so I thank everyone for your help and
Pat for your help
thank you and um
the bottom of this YouTube interview so
people can
great all right thank you guys thank you
thank you Dr Greer good night bye
