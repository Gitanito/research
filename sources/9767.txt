I missed the handrail and feel headfirst as if diving into a pool. 

I then remember looking down on my body and my brother standing over me crying and pulling my hair to get back up the stairs. I saw my mother run down and pick me up crying and blowing air in my mouth, I remember thinking why is she doing that I'm okay. Then the next thing I was in my body looking up at my mom and then I was unconscious in a coma for two weeks. 

I woke up in a hospital and never spoke of my experience until I was eleven and mom turned white when I told her about the details of my brother crying and dragging me up the stairs - she confirmed it.
