 &nbsp; &nbsp;     Periodical:  The New Life [Idaho]</I>      

    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 New Life, The.
 A Monthly Periodical Devoted to Attaining a Higher and Nobler Realization of Life.
 1903  Monthly
 Orofino, ID.  Editor: Ida M. Brooks.
 1/1, August 1903.  75 cents a year, 28 pp.

H.H. Brown, New Thought Primer: Origin, History and Principles of the Movement.  A Lesson in Soul Culture (San Francisco, CA: "Now" Folk, 1903), 56, says that this was "devoted in part to New Thought" but the advertisements for it as "really the best New Thought magazine out."  Brooks was a mental healer and for the nominal sum of 50 cents would send "a splendid letter of helpfulness," and for $1.00 a month she would send her "strong healing radiations of Infinite Vitality," both services vouched for by testimonials.  Featured an Irish-dialect parody (patterned on Finley Peter Dunne's Mr. Dooley) of Sydney B. Flower's promoting a "Health Cigar" ("O'Hoolihan's Middytashuns on the â€˜Hilth Cigar'").  University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
