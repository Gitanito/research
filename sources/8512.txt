  		          Non-Local Consciousness and the Near-death Experience

  By Barbara Mango, Ph.D.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    The day science begins to study nonphysical phenomena, it will make more   progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.

    Nikola Tesla, Inventor   (1856-1943)

    &nbsp;

  In 2005, the journal   Science published an issue listing the top 125 questions scientists have yet   to answer. The most significant inquiry was, “What is the universe made of?”   immediately followed by, “What is the biological basis of consciousness?”&nbsp;   This question may be reframed by asking, “Does consciousness have a   biological basis at all?”             [1]    &nbsp;         Researchers have developed two opposing hypothesis to explain the connection   between consciousness and the near-death experience: materialism and   non-materialism.&nbsp;

    Materialist science maintains the foundation of consciousness is based   exclusively on neuronal activity in the brain. Neurons are defined as      cells that   carry messages between the brain and body. Susan Blackmore, one of the strongest   proponents of this brain-based theory asserts:

  We are biological   organisms, evolved in fascinating ways for no purpose at all and with no end in   any mind.&nbsp;  We are simply here and   this is how it is.      [2]

  Blackmore upholds   what is termed “the materialist,” or “local-consciousness” theory. Materialism   hypothesizes that consciousness is confined to the brain’s electrical processes   and neuronal activity.&nbsp;  Materialists   postulate a near-death experience is merely the physiological process of a dying   brain.

    Materialists purport NDEs cannot be   irrefutably proven and therefore, any opposing paradigm is inherently   flawed.&nbsp;  S ince   this model is still taught at most medical schools in the Western world, the   majority of near-death researchers continue to support the paradigm that brain   processes create consciousness.

  Renown cardiologist and near-death researcher   Pim van Lommel contends two additional factors strengthen adherence to this   premise.&nbsp;  First, nearly all   government funding is awarded to traditional science.&nbsp;   According to philosopher Ilja Maso:

  &nbsp;

  Most current researchers employ the materialist hypothesis, “based on   materialist, mechanistic, and reductionist assumptions. It attracts most of the   funding, achieves the most striking results, and is thought to employ the   brightest minds. The more a vision deviates from this materialist paradigm, the   lower its status and the less money it receives.[3]

  &nbsp;

    Secondly, materialists tend to reject any challenge to their rigidly held model.&nbsp;

  Philosopher Thomas Kuhn states the   non-materialist theory is often considered incongruent with the traditional   model. As he explains:

  &nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   All research results that cannot be accounted for by the prevailing   worldview are labeled “anomalies” because they threaten the existing paradigm   and challenge the expectations raised by this paradigm.&nbsp;   Needless to say, such anomalies are initially overlooked, ignored,   rejected as aberrations, or even ridiculed.&nbsp;   Near-death experiences are such anomalies.[4]

  The opposing paradigm, termed non-materialism,   purports consciousness is independent of matter and the brain functions as an   intermediary between spirit and body. This perspective supports the existence of   a non-local, continuing consciousness upon clinical death. Van Lommel compares   non-local consciousness to global communication.&nbsp;   Information is continuously exchanged via electromagnetic fields   undetectable to ordinary awareness. As he explains:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   We only become aware of these electromagnetic informational fields at the   moment we switch on our TV, cell-phone, or laptop.&nbsp;   What we receive is not inside the instrument, nor in the compartments,   but thanks to the receiver, the information from the electromagnetic fields   becomes observable to our senses and hence perception occurs in our   consciousness. If we switch off the TV set, the reception disappears, but the   transmission continues.&nbsp;  The   information transmitted remains present within the electromagnetic fields.&nbsp;   The connection has been interrupted, but it has not vanished   (“non-locality”)…As soon as the function of the brain has been lost, as in   clinical death…memories and consciousness do still exist, but the receptivity is   lost, the connection is interrupted.      [5]

  Cutting-edge   research in quantum mechanics, (a theory describing the world of atoms and   subatomic particles and their interaction between energy and matter), proposes a   theoretical, yet highly persuasive argument supporting the paradigm of non-local   consciousness.

    Theoretical physicist Fred Alan Wolf contends that quantum mechanics continue to   authenticate the non-materialist paradigm. As he explains:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   There is evidence that suggests the existence of a non-material,   non-physical universe that has a reality even though it may not as yet be   clearly perceptible to our senses and scientific instrumentation.&nbsp;   When we consider out-of-body experiences…though they cannot be replicated   in the true scientific sense, they also point to the existence of non-material   dimensions of reality.[6]

  Van Lommel’s   research indicates that various aspects of an NDE correspond with or are   analogous to some of the basic principles from quantum theory, such as   non-locality, entanglement, interconnectedness, and instantaneous information   exchange in a timeless and placeless dimension.”[7]   &nbsp;

  Cutting-edge   research in quantum mechanics suggest consciousness and quantum processing   reside in the microtubules of brain cells. Microtubules are fibrous, hollow rods   located in the brain. Their primary function is to help support and shape cells.   The human brain is composed of approximately eighty-seven billion neurons. It is   estimated that one-hundred times as many microtubules exist in every neuron.   Quantum mechanics postulates each neuron either contains, or supports   consciousness.

  According to   mathematical physicist Sir Roger Penrose:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Let’s just say the heart stops beating and the blood stops flowing   [during a NDE], the microtubules lose their quantum state. The quantum   information within the microtubules is not destroyed, it can’t be destroyed, it   just distributes and dissipates to the universe at large.&nbsp;   If the patient is resuscitated, revived, this quantum information can go   back in the microtubules and the patient says, “I had a near-death experience…If   they’re not revived, and the patient dies, it’s possible this quantum   information can exist outside the body, perhaps indefinitely as a soul This   account of consciousness explains things like near-death experiences and out of   body experiences      [8]   &nbsp;

    Penrose has termed his theoretical model of microtubule consciousness the   Orchestrated Objective Reduction Theory, commonly referred to as ORCH-OR.&nbsp;   Although ORCH-OR has been widely challenged by the scientific community,   numerous researchers, including anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff staunchly   defend it. As Hameroff asserts, nobody has landed a serious blow to it [ORCH-OR].   It’s very viable.      [9]        				  								It remains medically inexplicable for lucid   								consciousness to occur during a time when no   								measurable brain activity exists.    								Van   								Lommel compares the brain in this state to a   								computer that has been disconnected from its   								power supply, unplugged, and all its circuits   								disabled.[10]     								&nbsp; Quantum   								mechanics provides a theoretical framework   								supporting the validity of non-materialism and   								the near-death experience. It is this author’s   								hope that quantum mechanics will finally bridge   								the gap between science and spirituality.

  As each of us awakens to the fact that   our individual awareness is part of a much grander universal consciousness,   humanity will enter the greatest phase in all of recorded history, in which we   will gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of all existence.&nbsp;   This will involve the consolidation of wisdom over millennia, a   coalescence of science and spirituality, and convergence of the greatest   concepts of our existence.&nbsp;  The   answers lie within us all.[11]
