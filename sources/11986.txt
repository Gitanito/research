  		              		Experience Description   

    I had gotten a piece of metal in my eye when I was working on my car. I had rinsed out my eye.  Then I had my wife look for anything in my eye and she did not see anything. I was working outside security, driving around in a car on the night shift at the prison.  I had to go inside the prison to eat my dinner and while I was there I stopped by the medical department and had a nurse look at my eye.  She didn't see anything in it either.  Yet, I still had problems with it.  When I left work, I went to the nearest emergency room and the nurse there took a look a my eye and told me I had a piece of metal in it.  A doctor came to see me.  He put my head into a medical device so I could not move my head.  He took the metal out and also had to grind out some rust.  After he did that, he put me into a large chair and told me to keep my head up.  

I passed out and instantly was in outer space.  I could hear a swooshing noise and I could see a lot of stars and the blackness of space.  There was also a bright, green line stretching from as far as I could see to my left and to my right.  While wondering which way to go, I was slowly drifting to the left so I went to the left.  It didn't take me very long and I was in front of a tunnel.  The green line covered the tunnel with what appeared to be a door.  The yellowish light from the tunnel was seeping out from behind the green door.  

The doctor yelled at me to keep my head up and instantly, I was back in my body.  Looking back at this I remember not seeing my nose or any other part of my body.
