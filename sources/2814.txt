PREFACE ON PERSONALITY
The long history of hagiology leaves little surviving that
is novel or inviting for further exploitation by the critic. On
the other hand, the sincerity of
it,
so far as the putative
authors may be morally responsible persons,
is
seldom called
in question. The shaky godliness of the Koran or of the book
of Mormon has been swallowed or swept aside by its success.
Pragmatically, honesty in bibles
is
not
a
matter for dis
cussion, much less so than
is
the dependableness of spirit-
mediums. The straight question
is
of what interest to
mankind may be the documentary revelation under discus
sion.
A
swindle foisted onto the public might precisely meet
its spiritual needs.
However, innovations do start with excuses or claims or
charges and countercharges, and that period must be lived
through by publisher and especially by editor. Anyhow,
books of the polemic sort are perfectly legitimate at the
polemic stage of the game of beliefs. When
it
comes to
a
question of inspiration, the old claims of alleged sacred writ
ings to men's allegiance must be radically toned down by the
modern way of judging by comparison with the authenticity
of other, more humble screeds. Thus, in some sense, every
writing that has sense must partake of "inspiration," what
ever that means. To me
it
suggests that everything we think
and write, however simple, has passed through our minds, has
been shorter or longer put
in
storage, or, at least, in digestion,
and has issued at the point of the pencil or on the typewriter
when summoned by
a
conscious will of the kind called, "a
point of view." The writer presses
a
button called, "point of
view," and the scripture flows forth whether
it
glorifies God
or announces
a
football game.

vi PREFACE
All this does not renounce all claim that a record such as
the Fox-Taylor is different. We call it a difference of author
ship. We rather naively assume as authors personalities who
answer substantially to the common use of the term. We
say, "there must be an author for what is spoken or written."
We live in a strange world in which every category, every
common noun, when questioned by the dialectic of philoso
phy, leads over to its opposite, so that we are shaken in our
faith in the reality of experience. Our only salvation is to
grasp a proper theory of environments. If we once for all are
convinced that such contradictions are due to our immersion,
briefly or enduringly, into a changed, vital complex (under
some agreed title of "dimension," "frame," or whatnot) the
situation is cleared up.
Thus our thought, passing from one complex to another,
from a cubic to, say, a tesseract character, could very reason
ably modify its conception of what it is wont to cluster about
the term, "personality." We have little in the way of tools
of thought, beyond common nouns, such as "personality,"
and are persistently misled in their use by our inevitable wan
derings through the dimensions. The study of psychic
research, therefore, is a study of psychology and even of
grammar, of rhetoric, and of logic.
It is well established by the science of religions that the
scriptures (bibles) are social (national) products. But they
were nevertheless written by the hands of individual persons,
as everything written must be. The writers expressed group
ideas or thoughts which had arisen from a give-and-take
process, in which some persons doubtless counted for more
than others, but the resultant molded and hardened formulas
were universally valid within the intelligence complex in
which they arose. Each and every scripture and book or
publication must be treated in this psycho-social way if we
would arrive at some notion of essential authorship. It must
be insisted that the road to authorship is the road to personal

ity. For the purpose in hand, personality is both individual
and social.
Thus, on the one hand, nothing in the universe is more
substantial than personality, while, on the other, nothing is
more evasive. Numerous sacred books are evidence of the
social welding and solidarity attained by their respective
nationalities. Perhaps nothing is better test of the finished
growth of a nationality than the production and institution
of sacred books. What we understand as personalities, in the
enlarged sense, therefore, enter by indirection (not to say
putatively) into their redaction.
Still confining ourselves to supernormal authorship, we re
mark that modern times have fathered and favored a special
group of such phenomena. Individuals or coteries of men
are habitual recipients of written messages through mediums
and emanating from individual spirits or coteries of spirits.
Passing over present discussion of the allegations of author
ship and of the part played by the medium, one may dwell
for a moment on the mere inquiry as to the singularity or
plurality or, better, collectively of the authorship. Of this
modern sort of inspiration the Fox-Taylor Record is aston
ishing for its sustained, tireless, successful effort, centered, by
the way, on the drawing of supernormal, crayon portraits of
spirits.
The statements in the letters fortified by the explanations
appended by Mrs. S. E. L. Taylor (Mrs. Geo. H. Taylor) are
consistent throughout the twenty-three-year lapse of time;
they produce a cumulative impression that the personalities
are quite distinct but that, when in harmony, as when one
spirit is helping another to communicate, there is a blending
so that two appear almost as one. Such is also the ideal of
earthly friendships and marriages.
One gathers from it all the sense of a union of separate
souls into one great soul, like a nation roused to war, and
then of the resumption of the smaller, original personalities

viii PREFACE
for sake of the maintaining of social life; for if that is lost
then the daily bread of life is denied. The amalgamations
alluded to are for occasions hors de ligne. The total impres
sion about infringement of personality is not that, in the freer
life beyond, it is lost but that it is rendered more adaptable
and cooperative. On the other hand, we find that the positive,
outstanding characters of the past receive their meed of re
spectful observance and compliance from those newer spirits
who are eager to benefit from superior leadership.
This book is meant to set forth the self-sacrificing work of
Dr. and Mrs. G. H. Taylor in attending, supervising, and
recording the work of the medium Katie Fox over a long
series of years. Except for the last period, Katie was, during
psychic activity, a dweller at the sanatorium ("Dr. Taylor's
Swedish Movement Cure." The two houses, on Sixth Ave
nue, New York, are still standing at n.e. corner of 38th
Street). She received her board free, but no other payments.
I believe that during the last period, when her two sons lived
with* her, she came from her apartment to the Madison
Avenue Hotel for the sittings, she was served tea and was
paid one dollar besides. Popular misconception as to the
chrematistic pursuit of mediumship must receive a jolt from
this news. For the benefit of the uninitiated I have followed
the custom of other books on psychic experiences by prefixing
this one with a sketch of the spiritualistic movement. The
life of the Fox sisters is still to be written; and I hope that
the Fox-Taylor Record and this book of descriptive matter
may together furnish valuable materials for it that would
otherwise be lost or overlooked.
The latter half of the present book is occupied with an
analysis of the Record. There is no attempt at completeness
or exhaustiveness. I hope that that task may follow, and
believe it will busy other hands than mine. However, I have
hoped to break the sod and indicate what could be done in this
way. The rubrics selected are those that occur to one on a

cursory glance at the text; they are obvious and popular.
Again, my object was not the proof of veridicity but an ap
preciation of what we can learn of positive import from such
writings and that chiefly about the next life.
All national religion has concerned itself with such descrip
tion, as my friend Professor Macchioro has pertinently re
marked. And this whether the time-and-place imagination
has located Orcus under the earth, as with Egyptians and
Homer, or in the sky, as with Hebrews, Orphics, and Chris
tians. Whether the essentially domestic nature of these
Fox-Taylor revelations entitles them to a distinct, specific
pigeonhole is an open question. If it does, there is ample
proof for you that to a considerable extent our ideas of the
hereafter are, like our other ideas, a reflection of the culture
of the times. Our thoughts of the hereafter are no longer
occupied with helmeted warriors, self-sufficient sages, and en
trancing queens; but with the prolongation into another
world of the well differentiated categories of our lives, such
as knowledge of the physics and mathematics of our universe,
biological research, the cultivation of the arts and music, and
the social organization as bearing on the individual.
Somehow these modern openings must be brought into line
with those ancient ones (not so very long ago, after all) ; they
cannot be handled as something apart, something new in the
world. But they do bear the hall-marks of our democratic
age, if only because they are open to all without special initia
tion. He who can pay a good medium can obtain them. He
who is acceptable to a circle can be admitted to it.
But all this is far from proving that the information, the
picture, the fairy tales are of terrestrial origin or speak in
materialistic and biologic terms. Those terms undoubtedly
furnish the temporal setting; they differentiate the myth of
Demeter searching for Persephone from the revelation of Ma
preparing a heavenly home for Pa. That difference in setting
can be accounted for by the democracy of modern times; our

habit of thinking in terms of the common man ; our renounc
ing of myth in reflecting on ourselves. Even today we can
and do in bookish reverie float into the glamour of Tristan
and Isolde; but we automatically snap back into the latest
front-page scandal â€”into the world as it is; into "English as
she is spoke."
While historical comparisons, therefore, enclose much that
is attractive for psychic science, it is doubtful whether, at the
present stage of it, much of decisive
is
to be won from them,
save the recognition of
a
common, spiritual element. We be
lieve that
it
is
something positive which impresses our earthly
souls as much as we impress
it
by lending to
it
contemporary
forms and fashions.
It
is
something redolent of personality,
in the first place, of
a
circumambient personality, and, in the
second place, of those erstwhile human personalities which
are biologically tied to our own surviving persons or inter
twined by tradition or through education with our men
talities.
The conviction of
a
future life will not be gained from
analysis, for the field of analysis
is
divided into separate
compartments which interlock only through acquired faith.
But
a
thorough soaking of oneself in such phenomena and
scripture as those offered by the long-drawn Fox-Taylor
Record constitutes
a
direct appeal to our kindred nature,
which overleaps all circumstances of logic, learning, and
laboratory and convinces our unitarian selves.

INTRODUCTION
Katie Fox is more than a titular for this book, although
the same be larded o'er with much discussion which is de
cidedly out of her latitude and longitude. Without Katie it
could not have been written. Very likely Dr. and Mrs. Tay
lor, in their bereavement, would somehow have been gratified
by other openings and consolations to which their hearts
would have listened even though their assent faltered. She
alone could have written this Psychic Legacy, the Record.
This volume of Narrative and Analysis, therefore, is devoted
to such account as seemed practicable of this important and
serious specimen of Katie's automatic writing. Enough is
cited to give pause to those who glibly object that "spirit
communications" are trivial or nonsensical. Much of our
earthly lives is foolishly wasted, anyway. Read "Babbit"!
However, it is just conceivable that there are persons who can
come away from perusal of this Record preserving an unsym
pathetic attitude. Many things are possible and there are all
sorts of men.
Since not a few readers lack information on the extent and
nature of the spiritualist revival of the last century, it was
quite necessary to say something about that. The historical
part of this volume is all the more called for, since the career
of Katie Fox as a medium was certainly the most typical, as
it was the central feature of events which are to be held either
light or weighty according to the interest which the reader
takes, or is led to take, in metapsychic phenomena and to the
importance which he attaches to them.
This volume, while offering the author an opportunity to
pay an unworthy tribute to a veteran friend of his boyhood,
Robert Dale Owen, invites further to a discussion of the prin

ciples which should guide the public in its attitude toward
mediums. He has ventured to point out the desirability of
conforming in practice to a considerate treatment which,
though pretty obvious, it seems extremely difficult for even
friends of the metapsychic movement to adhere to; and he
hopes that if he has reacted rather sharply from what seems
to him ill-advised severity in an unexpected quarter, it will
not be judged, on mature reflection, that his criticisms over
shoot the mark.
Certainly the Record and explanatory volumes and exe
gesis are not the first books of their character to appear. The
cause of the truth in matters metapsychic will be the better
served by an abundant literature of the sort, if it only be well
considered and deal with well authenticated events.
The practice is already consecrated of venturing, by aid of
inference from occurrences which, for personal reasons, have
especially excited the attention of an author-editor, to annex
a more or less theoretical treatise in which are made to ap
pear, with salience, those points worthy of assertion in a gen
eral form and suggested by the events under study.
Obviously, this book would not have been written did the
author not hold the materials in the Record for facts of some
sort. On the other hand, a brake must be put on credulity, a
place for these facts must be found in an evolutionary series,
and the fancy of an immediate millennium must be disci
plined by the chilling hand of Science.
At the outset, are we to take the so-called superstition of
the savage as a brutal ignorance which the hosts of light are
to batter down, although, through the centuries, it will not
down? Or rather are we to look on it as the beginning of an
inquiry which is to blossom, with the ages, into the all-
absorbing problem for men? The assumption of minor
acolytes of science that everything is anathema which does
not yield to tests of weight and measure previously set up,

will not stand close inspection. "New occurrences, new
standards," were a better watchword.
The timely discussion revolves about two main axes or
points of view: (a) the materio-psychic, (b) the nature of
personality: *
(a) The materio-psychic discussion is more than classic.
Reduced to simplest terms, it is the master debate of history,
and, to the point of near identity, lies next to the problem of
immortality. In the absence of the testimony of the meta-
psychic and paraphysical phenomena, the materio-psychic
debate, in restricted scope, would be the only forward-looking
quarrel which would enliven the rationalist desert.
Solution lies in the acquisition of a firm hold on a kinetic
point of view, which imparts a sort of "logic of continuity."
This logic is applicable in many cases where the usual "logic
of contrasts" does not prove helpful. The common sense of
refined minds notes innumerable cases where to raise the con
trast, "either, or," serves no good purpose. The way out is
to include both horns of the dilemma in one and the same
class, and then to judge of the whole class from principles of
logic which demand that one take a higher standpoint, from
which the whole may be surveyed. This is the essence of the
Platonic idea.
In a way, the illustration of war so portentous and signifi
cant today, affords a halting parallel. Pacifists comparing
war with peace, and preferring the latter, condemn all war,
without stopping to inquire whether there be any difference
in the merits of the parties. The point of view is lofty but
prematurely taken. Statesmen must confine themselves to
practical morality: Who began the war? This is a lower
point of view, but a necessary stadium under belligerent
conditions. But philosophers may take a still higher stand
than pacifists. They assert that war-peace constitutes a cate
gory of unavoidable interaction, and that the alternate play
of the two is but one process.

INTRODUCTION
Our churches, our laboratories, and our experts in politics,
economics, sanitation, and other lines, do their best to abolish
war, pestilence, revolution, strikes, crises, and famines. Good
work! But without the grand, the terrible, the cataclysmic,
our ideals would go a glimmering. Hifalutin propaganda of
bourgeois utilities and smug moralities gives us pause. A
world in perfect balance is dead.
In somewhat similar (but not identical) vein, we may
entertain gladly the notion of matter-spirit. Of course, one
of the alternatives wins in the long run, for it becomes a
sort of goal â€”the good alternative. Thus, in the pair, war-
peace, it is peace that we want to win out, perhaps only
under more favorable conditions. And so, in the pair,
matter-psyche, it is psyche that will get the upper hand,
if only a more psychic home for man can be discov
ered.
But, in the meanwhile, we are in presence of a kinetic
affair, a process which it is as unfair to call material as to
call mental. The author is convinced that the crying need
of the forward looking mind is to master the conception of
progress as fundamentally materio-psychic, â€”a moving
equilibrium in events presenting themselves to him now
under the preconceived mental habit of the physical, now
of the mental. Those preconceptions are utilized by a Higher
Power as the levers of our progress. The necessity of the
alternation would appear to be lodged chiefly in man's own
psychology; it is subjective.
This is not to destroy, for every purpose, the contrast,
matter vs. mind, quite the contrary, but to confine it to its
proper place. Indeed, the useful consequence of this way of
thinking is to extend the field of the contrast. Life we find
ever exhibiting itself to us in this dual guise, and in an
internecine struggle between subject and object. So that,
interested as we should be in the special case of human im
mortality, we must conclude that life beyond death, if there

be life beyond death, is compact of the same contrasted ele
ments â€”mind and matterâ€”as before death.
Cogitations along this relativist line are calculated to put
the reader in a receptive frame of mind toward the Rochester
knockings, whose respectability is popularly enhanced if we
are able to regard them as of the same class with revivals
generally. The mediumship of Katie Fox, unobtrusive and
unassuming, is also the most efficient and productive. It is
the golden thread running through modern spiritualism.
(b) Of what is this our personality composed? Here we
must speak only according to what we seem to know, or
think we know, for the impossibility of definitive knowledge
is but too manifest. The nearest approximation to a solvent
is commonly offered by mysticism, including religion; but
the explanation which the times demand must lie closer to
the methods of science.
Our personality seems to be something specified or special
ized out of life-tendencies that otherwise might flow carelessly
on in a general way, and further to be infused with perception
and consciousness, which we must take as a direct datum of
the Divine. Scientific method is helpful chiefly in tracing the
limits of tendencies and forces making for personality. The
question
is,
how far does personality extend in this or that
direction? What does immortality lend to man beyond the

ditions of immortality. The field for telepathic hypothesis
is immeasurably widened. In an universe of forces and
persons, the problem must ever be as to how far the forces
are individual, how far impersonal. The dilemma of per
sonal-impersonal is raised whenever the metapsychic and
paraphysical phenomena are studied. The very occurrence
of materializations illustrates it. Is telepathy accomplished
by spirit messengers or by radio-messages? Are dreams,
even, occasionally suggested by hovering, personal influences,
or are they purely kaleidoscopic presentations to conscious
ness carried over out of chance experiences? And finally, is
our personality a monad, or a growing and perhaps also a
decaying thing?
When we shall be enabled to answer all these questions,
we shall have pretty well defined ourselves. Every step in
advance, however, will inevitably deeply affect and alter the
framing of our questions. New knowledge supersedes old
queries. The road is still a long one, but the answer will
surely come to mankind, visible and invisible; and the edu
cation of the effort will transform our own personalities.
We shall move about more easily in this subject when we
begin to perceive that the occurrences are not so strange as
they seem. Physically, it is as strange to split wood with
an ax as without one. And so, on the psychic side, it is as
strange to write in the guise of an author of poetry or romance
or history or science as it is to perform the so-called "auto
matic" writing. By diminishing the ascription of personality
to the former classes and by increasing it for the last class â€”
the automatic writingâ€”we arrive at a very fair idea of the
nature of the problem of personality and of the difficulties
surrounding its solution.
Nothing lies further from the author's aim than propa
ganda. Books are written and published in response to a
more or less felt demand from the public, in some of its
groups; but each one decides, in the stillness of his heart,

what he does or does not need, in the way of written com
munings.
I should never have believed in spiritualism had it not
been for the experiences of my family with Katie Fox which
I have attempted to relate in Book II. Just how far the
title "spiritualist" is in a given case, appropriate or the
reverse, laudatory or opprobrious, the curious reader can
satisfy himself from the following pages.
There must have been something cogent about those
seances with Katie Fox to which I was occasionally invited.
It is also true that I was caught young and suffered an
inoculation several degrees stronger than those invented by
Dr. Jenner. It follows that I can hardly blame others less
privileged for not sharing my interest in them. But few
have enjoyed such a rare opportunity. Nor do I expect that
my feeble relations will impart to the reader the conviction
which the original, complete seances enforced.
There is an important rule laid down for the investigation
of any line of natural occurrences, that novel explanations
are not to be adopted until old ones are exhausted. The
superstitious explanation of the metapsychic phenomena is,
indeed, extremely old, but we infer that is now ruled out, as
it is precisely for that purpose that the rule was laid down.
An acceptable explanation must be one of the causes already
sanctioned by science, which are chiefly matters of more or
less obvious touch, sight, weight, and measure. There
is,
then,
a
submerged term in the scientific mentality which
assumes that none of the causes alleged by superstition can
possibly stand the test of weight, measure, etc. The
theoretical volume of this series
is
concerned with an estima
tion of the validity of this suppressed hypothesis.
The result of this scientific attitude taken altogether has
been that the spiritualist explanation
is
not deemed worthy
of attention, (1) because
it
is
superstitious, belonging to the
rejected prescientific era, or (2) because the phenomena may

be assumed to be imaginary and hence negligible. If any
positive interest is aroused in the languid scientist, it runs
on lines of a supposed, materialistic telepathy. But the basis
of resistance to psychic onslaught is inertia springing from
actual indifference to the whole subject. Our era has reacted
radically from superstition to the point of producing quite
a crop of materialist pastors added to a philosophic concep
tion of spirituality known as "rationalism."
For when science arose, what was spirituality to do? It
had theretofore masqueraded in superstition, often misnamed
"religion." The new problem was to contrive how it might
be travestied in science. The problem was solved (as all
problems are solved â€”for the moment) by the invention of
a system of thought or rather a state of mind which we make
no mistake in identifying with rationalism.
The Church had credulously entertained the naive notion
of an immaterial heaven. Such a paradox was not surprising
on the part of clerics absorbed in dogma, doctrine, and
divinity. The new rationalism fell heir to the immateriality
while it denounced the immortality. It claimed and still
claims that spirituality is a vast something, as precious as
impalpable, hovering over life, but so dependent upon our
pretended mortality, so interwoven with matter, that it can
not permit that a part of itself â€”the particular spirituality
of each man â€”should survive his earthly, visible career. The
aim is to lay all weight on the importance of the spiritual
in our lives, and yet to deny to the spiritual any existence
that deserves the names of "positive" and "dominant." The
beliefs we nourish in God, heaven, ruling Providence, abstract
virtues, systems of rewards are merely useful self-deceptions.
In order to breast the full force of this doctrine, let us trace
some of its ramifications.
According to this way of thinking, philosophy is a struggle
to subject every last manifestation of our lives to science, so
that it may conquer to the point of ruthlessness, and so that

the conception of the spiritual shall concede as little as
possible to the spiritual, while preserving the obvious re
spectability and polite decency appertaining to the term
(even science could not abolish that). We are assured that
while, of course, there can be no immortality and no orthodox
heaven, which would be a foolish place anyway, we may, if
we only look on things and events sensibly and free from
inherited fancies, find an adequate heaven about us. The
natural scenery, the best impulses of the heart, the essential
purposes of society are all right, conduct is perfectible, and
everything may be for the best in the best of worlds, at least,
for him who wishes to think so. This sort of inductive
idealism rationalists still declare to fill the whole of the
requirements of a rational soul.
Of course, these philosophers add, there are many things
we cannot understand. Some persons are less lucky than
others, and, in the absence of immortality, will never get
another chance to restore their unbalanced state. But then,
personality is a small, an unimportant thing in face of the
vast forces of Nature, an accident caught in the crack of
chance, and peculiarly liable to be blotted out. Without it
the universe will wag on just the same.
This program never seemed satisfactory to me. But there
was no ready answer to it. I could not but concede my
unimportance; and that my feeling of rebellion was but a
relic of simian superstition entirely disapproved by that
severe Moloch, Science. One's spontaneous but feeble, self-
accusing protest before this self-denying wisdom is precisely
the same in quality as that before the orthodox religious
doctrine of eternal punishment. In both cases, dogma having
passed the bounds of finite reason, has had recourse to
theoretical violence, mental brutality. But there has been no
satisfactory answer to either position, except just that you
cannot believe it.

veritable paradises, I encountered two hay-rack loads of the
underworld trekking in. I said to myself, "This is like hell."
As a phylacteried rationalist, I should have thought, "This is
hell, honest to goodness." I believe the rationalist is nearer
right in his terrestrial location of hell than of heaven. And
yet, I am not ready to guarantee that, in a further environ
ment, there be not souls of the bad, souls of gross texture
incapable of refinement. The rationalist, however, points
with cogency to a base life as its own punishment. There is
nothing absurd about the part of his doctrine which would
banish sentimentalism. But can he also banish superstition?
The ideals of religion and morality, the rationalist declares,
are merely ideas. They have no hold or place in nature,
outside of the impalpable thoughts of men. This is precisely
where he takes issue with Plato. The latter could not
reconcile the complexity of the moral and spiritual realms
with a merely inductive world; through him the nascent
rationalism of Athens preserved so far its touch with primi
tive religion, mysticism, and superstition. The world waited
long for Science to arise and carry the movement a step
further.
Plato did not even deny the existence of the gods, and
gave an amused consent to myths of Olympus. He even
invented a few of his own to lend greater emphasis to his
plea for an independent super-spirituality. He broadened
the conception of a separate dwelling place for morals and
religion into a complete, duplicate world, where influences
are at work reaching, through the ideal route, our whole
lives in all their details, influences which should be as potent
in shaping our personalities and conduct, from one direction,
as is the visible and tangible environment, from another.
To the rationalist, progress, in a racial sense, is a doubtful
thing. It is a mere adaptation of our bodies to the geological
and astronomical changes that science ascertains. There are,
of course, also moral and mental adaptations. Progress con

sists, in fact, in the succession of these morphological changes.
It is debatable whether they will ever lead to a moral re
generation. There is nothing to prove that positively.
Humanity and personality are but specks, anyway; the
mental world is impalpable and hence can ask for no quarter
in face of the needs of nature. The thin covering of vege
table mould upon the surface of the earth is a very curious
thing, a mere accident in the countless ages and infinite
spaces, where unavoidably, anything and everything are
bound to occur, sooner or later. Man
is,
of course, quite
a
creature of the vegetable mould.
It
would unduly delay the reader, were

the case for rationalism. In the absence of
a
spiritual science,
there
is
no answer to rationalism, except the unwillingness of
our acquiescence prompted by our lingering superstition.
Condemnation without

is
as complete under
rationalism as under Calvinism. Failure to create

is
as complete
in

other. Nevertheless, thanks to my taste for science,

have been
a
dyed-in-the-wool rationalist had
it
not been for
the positive assurances offered by our family seances with
Katie Fox.
I
should, doubtless, have contented myself with the
naturalistic range of thought. And even after
I
had received
the Fuchsian assurances, they became more or less dimmed
and glossed over by more practical duties until, in the ripe
ness of time,
I
was able to reread the Psychic Legacy with
some care. Then rushed over me with redoubled emphasis
the fervor of the youthful conviction.

CHAPTER I
REVIVALS
Any revival proper sets in with some sort of metapsychic
or near-miraculous occurrences, nor can it be said to be
finished so long as such occurrences continue to repeat them
selves. We must assume, at the same time, that no theory
for the spiritualist revivals has been generally accepted;
that is to say, they have not yet settled down to routine
performance nor by sheer familiarity attained to theological
or scientific respectability. The numerous religious revivals
of the sects are ushered in by camp-meeting ecstasy, even
with trances and "speaking with tongues," which constitute
a prologue quite as objectionable as the tambourine playing
at a modern spiritualist camp-meeting. It was no accident
but rather a concord in the evolution of our racial psychology
that the spiritual extravagances of one hundred and fifty
years ago were destined to split up and specialize into
scientific electro-magnetism and unscientific spiritualism.
Both were excursions into the unseen and proved the mystery
of the power of nature. This morning my neighbor with
much labor shoveled the snow from his stretch of sidewalk;
this afternoon the sun performed the same service for me.
In the first half of the nineteenth century, the minds of
men in the western world had been greatly wrought up over
mesmerism and magnetism. Galvani (1737-1798) had in
vented the electric battery: when certain metals were sus
pended in a bath of acid, the one was dissolved and deposited
on the other and, incidentally, a wire connecting the two
metal plates manifested electrical phenomena that had not
previously been isolated for experiment but which, as in the
experiments of Franklin, had been observed freely in nature.

If the wire was cut and a substance of resistant quality intro
duced, phenomena of light and heat occurred. If again, a
series of batteries being used, the ends of the wire were taken
in the hands, a thrill was experienced, which might amount
to a dangerous shock. Similar effects were produced by rub
bing a wheel of glass, turned as it pressed on a pad of woolen
cloth.
Since the phenomena arose from a metal bath, it was
assumed that the new force was a fluid. Subsequent dis
covery of the dynamic electricity evolved from the dry fric
tion of glass on wool did not serve to change the forms of
speech invoked to describe the experiments; nor did even the
still later and quite modern invention of the dynamo, whereby
the current is produced commercially by the mere revolving
of a coil of wire, an armature, past a magnet, without any
contact at all. The impression that there was a current
agreed also with the idea of a fluid.
In all three cases, it would appear that the force expended
by (a) the acid on the plates, by (b) the hand on the crank
turning the glass disc, by (c) the steam engine on the dynamo
had been found empirically to produce the same or a similar
result: it generated a "current" of electricity. The phrase
"electric fluid" became merely a screen for relative material
ism to hide behind. Popular expression for what really takes
place would be that all three of the very different modes of
generation alluded to succeeded in sending out an inde
pendent, dissociated force which imparted a thrill to the
touch, which, in nature, often covered the surfaces of ledges
and mountains, and which had such an affinity for certain
metals that it spread over them instantly. If they were
drawn and shaped into a wire, it would without appreciable
interval, follow the wire to the end, no matter how far that
might be. Wonderful discovery! While the image of a fluid
may aid the electrical engineer to correct conclusions as to
force and resistance, it is not thereby proven to be itself

correct. The conclusion does not justify the term except as
adopted for his purpose and for no other. So the atomic
theory is useful in chemistry, apart from any assumed infer
ence about the material objectivity of the atoms.
In some derangements, invigoration accrues to profit of the
human organism intercalated into a suitable, mild current of
electricity. The idea that this might be the case occurred
to the Austrian, Friedrich Anton Mesmer (1733-1815) in
1788. Unfortunately, he seems to have confused intercalation,
obstruction, and absorption with generation of the current.
He thought his patients might benefit by acting as wet plates.
They grasped rods immersed in a tub of water containing
powdered glass and iron filings, or, getting a different contact
with the metal, joined hands. Mesmer was denounced as a
charlatan; but, as in most cases where clear ideas have not
at first dissolved out and precipitated from a turmoil of
guesses and hypotheses, many persons still believed there was
"something in it"; and contemporary therapeutic use of
electricity by physicians of the most orthodox tint puts
Mesmer back onto the medical saints' calendar.
Next, the "drys" had their innings. For was it not plain
that the electric fluid could be produced by friction as well
as by immersion ? The origin of the current was again located
in the human body. Certain persons were magnetic machines
and could impart magnetized or magneto electricity by mere
laying on of hands, or by their mere presence. Hence the
literary expression, "a magnetic man." Doubtless a man is
an organism, and this fact means a large percentage of water,
so that animal magnetism should belong, strictly speaking,
to the wets. But the magnet itself is a dry piece of metal,
and so is the armature. Electricity, therefore,
is,
in itself,
neither wet nor
a
fluid.
It
is

or meteorological, chemical or physical; and further lab

electricity is relatively basic; and that our world is largely
or wholly sustained by or composed of it.
The amateur experiments of Franklin led, in fifty years, to
the empirical inventions of Morse. These dissociations of
force from matter became known to the world and aroused
the greatest wonder. Men rightly suspected that a new era
was at hand, and cudgeled their brains to form an idea of
what it would be like. So that long before the rise of power
plants and lighting plants, due to the genius of Faraday and
Maxwell, and of the so-called commercial electricity, the
western world was adapting its mentality to the new force
which seemed to have the new quality of invisibility. Re
flection, however, shows that mechanical force is identical in
the matter of invisibility. An electrical generator is just as
invisible or not as a steam engine.
Most persons, it must be admitted, are not highly qualified
to make broad, scientific generalizations, especially as they
severally obtain but a glimpse of the whole of a group of
related phenomena. And when the negative quality â€”as it
must seem â€”of invisibility is added, it is not to be wondered
at that the popular mind was early divided between satanic
and angelic imputations. The important point is that, on
the whole, and perhaps for the first time during the march
of the world, or at least of the Germanic world, into the
realms of the invisible, the victory lay with the angels. In
visibility was robbed of maleficence. The revolution in man's
view of his world was not unlike what the Christian era
displayed. It was never again to be the same. And the
revolution was due to Science! In our criticisms of Science,
let us not forget that unwittingly it remade our world. Along
the line of spirit, the scientific era was the next logical
step in furtherance of the same plan as that of the Christian
era.
Thought became distinctly psychologic. But not con
sciously such. Highly developed consciousness is a modern

affair. In the nineteenth century, however, electricity was
but an understudy to steel and steam which did the world's
work. Today, however, steam is largely superseded or com
plemented cooperatively by commercial electricity; and the
earlier period, while commercially preparatory for electricity,
was in thought already the age of electricity. That was the
time during which men were adjusting their minds to elec
tricity, and acquiring, unconsciously, the electrical viewpoint.
It marked a distinct advance of intelligence into the unseen
and a correspondingly constructive era for the human soul.
The astral body acquired a firmer texture, our hitherto in
comprehensible planet a most original and delicate instrument
for its inspection and exploration.
Up to and for a long time previously to the forties, nothing
had occurred to cast doubt upon the hoped for and expected
sufficiency of the scientific explanation of life. And what
Science had accomplished then was but a trifle compared
with what it has since accomplished. That explanation,
given a humanistic turn by rationalism, was already at grips
with the religious explanation, and victory was, or would
have been (had there been an impartial referee), assured.
That the seeds of a spiritual reaction were already sprouting
was all unsuspected. During the remainder of the nineteenth
century, for those who concerned themselves with such outre
speculations, the immanence of law in the biologic world was
accepted without question as the sole channel for inflow from
the unknown. Explanation of life was sought consciously
only in the visible world, where alone, indeed, experiment was
possible, for was it not the laboratory age?
Man had still enough to do to exploit the immanent and
current hypothesis. And so, even in scientific circles, the
subtle, impending psychic revolution was not sensed; for
man may be said not to have sprouted and grown the requisite
faculty. How far has he as yet succeeded? When a vision of

a method, a point of view, a definite road to travel must be
established and accepted. Forthwith man is absorbed in the
work cut out and ceases to weigh hypotheses. An hypothesis
like the scientific, the most virile in mental history, covers
all doubt as to its proper extent by the smoke screen of its
legitimacy. Legitimate, therefore, sufficient, conclusive, defin
itive: so ran the subconscious syllogism.
A powerful upheaval in the world of thought was, mani
festly to us looking from our modern vantage ground, indis
pensable in order to put the current scientific hypothesis in
the barber's chair for a close shave. In the first place, it was
requisite that Science should reach the stage of formulating,
of its own free motion, the scientific hypothesis. And then,
it was necessary that some wide, popular wave of emotional
thought, or rather experience, should put the scientific world
into a corner whence it could fight its way out only by a
critical scanning of its favorite, basic assumption.
This was the work of the spiritualistic revival.
Whether spiritualism be a religion or not, at least it has
succeeded where the consecrated religions have failed; for the
latter had fought in the dark an enemy whose ranks and
weapons they could only half discern. They threw out for
discussion all sorts of tentative issues. Foremost came the
endless quarrel about the existence of God, which was denied
by their opponents, while they themselves could but insist
that His existence transcended experimental science and was

unelect, convincing as it may be in theological theory and to
the logical but narrow minds of the Protestant reformers,
finally aroused the wrath of that austere, justice-loving
bourgeoisie, which was as logical and consistent in rejecting
religion for science as its ancestors had been originally in
adopting the articles of faith promulgated by Luther, Calvin,
or Knox. The bourgeoisie that counts, in this matter, in
cludes not only the large mass of Protestants but also the
agnostic Catholics.
The doubts expressed about orthodoxy by parents behind
closed doors were eagerly repeated in public by their enfants
terribles, while the most popular pulpit orators, like Henry
Ward Beecher, risked, and when not over powerful, fell vic
tims to churching for their dissent from dogmas which the
world had accepted for a thousand years.
And still the Church thrives amazingly. It carries on sys
tematic propaganda in heathen lands, where it is more useful
as a humanitarian, even a commercial agency, than as a
disseminator of its incomprehensible dogmas. This vitality
of the bearer of a discredited system of logic, the fact that
the very acolytes of science do their homage to Church almost
as regularly as ever, (this applies to the vast bourgeoisie who
constitute the main clientele of the Church) and pay to it
their tithes, unconstrained by law, since legal sanction has
been long since revoked, is due, in large measure, to the belief
that the Church is the mainstay of a morality grounded
upon a fundamental faith in immortality.
For immortality is to us the nearest touch of the vast un
seen, which, on any reasonable view, infinitely transcends the
seen, both quantitatively and qualitatively. If the Church is
the supreme guarantor of things unseen, it must constitute
immortality the keystone of the arch of faith. That is the
personal bond with the unseen, without which the Church
would cease to interest us. In the view of the Church, the
personality of God permeates His universe and lends that

touch of comprehension, of appreciation to men which con
stitutes also their precious, if petty, personalities. The uni
verse is theologically personal, and must be such in the
unseen as well as in the more contracted, visible districts.
The invisible will always prime the visible. The advance
of science only emphasizes this truth ; it affords but momen
tary surcease of our longings and must ever renew its burden
of exploration. To assign a terminus would be submissively
to invite annihilation. To bound our search for truth by the
fleeting visible of today would be at once to set up standards
impossible of determination and to display gross ignorance.
After all, it is Death that is the Great Revealer.
Human science today may be conceded to be man's best
way to extract a significance from experience. Doubtless the
utilities uncovered by biology or astronomy, by mathematics
or physics are precious documents and preparations for
apocalyptic insight; for the principles and forces at play are
cosmic and future in the sense that they contain the future
in posse. While science is our best avenue to learn the signifi
cance of things, it would appear to inhere in the very nature
of things that the Thing Signified should remain unseen.
As we mount "from sphere to sphere" or "from plane to
plane" (if we do), the forces and laws in play would appear
to change. For each new dimension, a new set of laws.
Accordingly, we are assured, in this third dimension, that
the material principles of evolution are already of limited
application. But when we have strenuously and meticulously
examined and excogitated its life and conditions and entou
rage, then we are at last rewarded with an inspired percep
tion of it all on grander scale, with wider import. Also so, by
inspiration from without, in large measure, we are made
ready for another life of higher usefulness. Immanent or
ingerent, forces unseen have always ruled and they ever will.

encompass man. In the sense that mind acts on matter, since

the latter is ultimately resolvable into the former, there is no
duality. But in the sense that life is both subjective and
objective, there is one. If the object is created for the sake of
affording a living to the subject, quite appropriately there
must be a point in the course of creation when the necessary
opposition arises. But this does not speak of a surrender
of the subject to the object. On the contrary, the crying need
for the subject now arises.
The Church is instituted (in due course) as perpetual
reminder of this need. For one thing, it is a semaphore on
the rocks of careless indulgence in the present glut of utilities.
In some form and under some ritual, the Church will ever be
needed. Our human sentiments are nowise the working of
utilities. The other way about, it is the sentiments and feel
ings that originated the utilities. Our need to live gives point
to the utilities of food and shelter and reproduction, our need
to love also gives point to the same; anger, musical sense,
even reason and every category called spiritual or mental are
such in origin as well as in function: they come from the
unseen and are in constant touch with it.
It is not surprising that the mass of the people, even those
unlettered and incapable of letters or of sustained thought,
at times draw gregariously close to the margin of the unseen
and obtain from it such inspiration as they may. It is sad
that inspiration is on occasion distorted even into the
bloody religious wars, fanatical creeds, devastating persecu
tion or superstitious credulity. History affords opportunity to
straighten out fundamental misapprehensions. Stratified into
classes, men obtain such help as they can. The history of
the raceâ€”the real history of its mentality â€”has yet to be
written. Neither a history of philosophy nor a philosophy
of history fills the bill. A new reckoning from a new and
spiritual point of view is due. The new history will con
vincingly demonstrate that human life is education for
immortality.

CHAPTER II
THE REVIVAL OF THE FORTIES OF THE LAST CENTURY
Humanly speaking, seventy or eighty years back was
a good while ago; but from the youth of the writer, when
Katie was a familiar figure under the parental roof, that
same date was not so very ancient. The Civil War had
then been over only about five years, but had accomplished
much to antiquate whatever had happened before it. Like
the World War, it had stimulated interest in psychic and
metapsychic phenomena, so that the infantile seeress of the
forties survived as the still young and flourishing somnam-
bule of the sixties and seventies.
But while the Fox family afforded the most sustained,
long-lived, and unalloyed demonstration of mediumship that
the United States or perhaps the world has seen, it cannot
claim an unique, epoch-making originality. Everything goes
to show that the epoch made the mediums, including the
Foxes, rather than the other way about. Mrs. Leah Fox Un
derhill 1
believed that spirits of a high class have declared
that, in view of prevailing materialism, it became necessary
"to overpower the world with a new flood of irresistible dem
onstration of the truth and reality of the next life and of
the immortality of the soul." And she claimed that the wave
started from this country.
Emma Hardinge,2 another seeress turned authoress, states
of Cincinnati: "Amongst private families it is known that
the manifestations had been rife before the rumor of the
Rochester knockings reached Cincinnati." These were by
the interested public generally coupled with the then pre-

vailing belief in magnetism. A young lady, magnetized by
her father, instead of exhibiting the usual psychological sub
mission to her operator's will, proceeded to delineate, in
striking pantomimic action, the habits and peculiarities of
several deceased persons, whom the family at once recog
nized. These singular conditions first appeared in this young
lady's case as early as 1846. Mesmerism was turning into
spiritualism.
Robert Dale Owen, in "Footfalls on the Boundary of
Another World," has collected a large number of authentic
ghost stories. Many of them are of occurrences just prior
to the Rochester rappings, as the demonstrations in the
presence of the Foxes have been alliteratively entitled. Per
haps the best attested and most interesting for the present
purpose are the rather ancient disturbances in the Wesley
Family (1716-1717) and the more recent apparitions and
knockings due to a lady called the Seeress of Prevorst (1825-
1826).
The former are described in forty-six pages of the
"Memoirs of the Wesley Family" by Dr. Adam Clarke.
They consisted in knocking at the door, groaning, whirling
of a handmill, gobbling as of a turkey cock close to the bed
side at night, knocking on shelves in the dairy, rustling as
of invisible persons walking about, rattling of the iron case
ment, visible rattling of door latch, walking up and down
stairs so heavily as to shake the house, drumming on doors,
always on the opposite side, knocking on outside door, sound
of cradle rocking in nursery where no cradle had been for
years, violent knocking at the prayer for the king (the
parents had been separated for a year because the mother
would not say amen to the prayer for King William).
There would be knocking always in the room not occu
pied, as investigators went in and out of the nursery. And
then a violent giving of Samuel Wesley's own private knock,
when he came home. On the opening of doors, they were

thrust back violently. The daughters became accustomed
to the knocking, which grew more familiar. A gentle tap
ping at the bed-head usually began between nine and ten at
night. Then they commonly said to each other, "Jeffrey is
coming, it is time to go to sleep." An oaken staff (ap
parently) was struck upon a chest, sound of a vessel full of
silver (coins) poured upon Mrs. Wesley, sound of a bell
thrown among bottles under the stairs, nothing broken.
"Soon after our large mastiff dog came, and ran to shelter
himself between them (Mr. and Mrs. Wesley. This was at
night.) as they went about together." While the disturb
ances continued, he used at first to bark and leap, and snap
on one side and the other, and that frequently before any
person in the room heard any noise at all. But after two
or three days, he used to tremble, and creep away before the
noise began. And by this the family knew it was at hand,
nor did the observation ever fail.
The Wesley case affords excellent illustration of the rule
so often exemplified in the metapsychic occurrences, that pol
tergeist gradually shades off into habitual, intelligent com
munication. The unseen power or personality first grasps
at crude, molar, boisterous methods of attracting attention
and of habituating the mentality to the unusual. The un
prepared mind is proof against direct, conscious intercourse.
It is doubtless subject to subtle, unconscious effects through
influencing of the more delicate organs of thought and even
of sensation, in ways little suspected, and by the conscious
but still not accepted and highly conventionalized images
of dreams and of subjective hallucinations. This species of
influence has doubtless been active ever since man was, so
to speak, invented, so that a dim consciousness gradually,
insensibly, taking possession of him, was diversely imaged
by different races into their respective Olympuses and
mythologies.

with its imagery and with its childish picture books and
myths, it relapses to its carnal pursuits of ambition, greed,
homicide, lust, and rapine until a new Olympus appears in
its skies. The worldlings must be shaken out of their spir
itual lethargy. And, by a sort of individual recapitulation,
the same thing occurs in personal experience. The day
for renewed and conscious appeal comes to the soul of man.
If he is to progress, it is perforce by hard knocks starting
from the vegetative and working up to the conscious, that he
may ultimately reach a divine self-consciousness.
Be this end-thought as it may, it is a simple idea that the
conscious, unseen personality will endeavor to reach the kin
dred consciousness of a visible, living person, and that to
this end he will recapitulate the effort of cosmic law, begin
ning with poltergeist and primitive manifestations of force,
even as the thunder speaks of undiscriminating violence, and
faring thence forth to a real touching of minds. It is not
for us to question the why of this process, but only to record
the facts of nature and to conform our conduct to them, any
more than we protest the ripening of our food from richly
mulched soil.
It is not astonishing that in that half fanatical age Emily
Wesley was still doubtful whether the communicant were
devil or angel. Since then, in this respect, times have
changed; the devil is hard to find even in Sheol, while the dis-
carnate drink cocktails in all respectability and even in de
fiance of the prohibition laws. While the devil is pretty well
suppressed, he is always ready to bob up again.
The other case, that of the Seeress of Prevorst, was en
acted in Wiirttemberg, Germany, from which country we
have imported the significant term, "Poltergeist." The life
of Madame Frederick Hauffe was written by Dr. Justinus
Korner,3 who enjoyed a high reputation in his own country,

not only as a physician, but for his literary talents, and as a
man of learning and of piety â€”a man whose sincerity and
good faith cannot be doubted even by the most skeptical.*
Throughout the year 1825, while residing in the village of
Oberstenfeld, not far from Loewenstein, in the northern
portion of the Kingdom of Wiirttemberg, Madame Hauffe
was visited, or believed herself to be, by the appearance,
usually in the evening, about seven o'clock, of a male figure
of dark complexion, which, she alleged, constantly begged for
her prayers. With the question of the reality of this appear
ance, nothing need here be said; but attention is invited to
the attendant circumstances.
His coming was always announced by knockings and clap
pings in the air. Day and night steps were heard on the
stairs. The same knockings were heard in the cellar and
behind a cask, on whichever side one stood. The kitchen
door was always open in the morning. Once, at eleven
o'clock at night, the house was shaken so that the rafters
moved. This commotion attracted the attention of passers-
by. Glasses were taken from the table and set on the floor.
When Madame Hauffe visited Loewenstein, the rappings
followed her.
As we approach our own time, the records of such dis
turbances as we are here examining so increase in number
that space fails to reproduce them. Passing over later Eng
lish and French experiences also cited by Owen in pari
materie, the most celebrated American case of poltergeist
must be adduced before we take up the Hydesville noises,
involving the Fox family, otherwise known as "Rochester
Rappings," both because the Stratford poltergeist stood
within the range of method of expression observed by the
other disturbers, previously mentionedâ€”the Wesley case and
that of Madame Hauffe â€”and because the Hydesville case
distinctly marked a further era in molar phenomena, verging

over into the molecular, anyhow, into human significance and
personality.
Indeed, the Stratford, Connecticut, disturbances shared the
novelty if not the intelligence of the rapping which, in prin
ciple, started at Hydesville. For we learn from Podmore
that the raps purported to come from a Frenchman, who
asserted that he had, when on earth, cheated Mrs. Phelps in
drawing up a settlement.5
The Rev. Eliakim Phelps moved into a house he had pur
chased at Stratford, Connecticut, February 22, 1848, and
the disturbances began March 10, 1850. There were four
children, a daughter, sixteen years old, a son twelve, and a
daughter six, these three by a former marriage of Mrs.
Phelps, and a son of his own, aged three.
On returning from church, March 10, 1850, and unlocking
the empty house, the family found that much disturbance
had taken place. The next day Dr. Phelps saw an umbrella
of its own accord leap from its place at the end of the hall,
a distance of twenty-five feet.6 A retired clergyman who
tarried as guest at the Phelps home was convinced that
neither the girl in the kitchen nor the children produced
these effects/ It is true that after Anna and Harry went
away for a sojourn the manifestations ceased, but a paper
with some mysterious characters was dropped at the front
door8 before Harry returned. Dr. Phelps visited the Fox
family in New York, became convinced that the phenomena
were similar, with the result that he allowed Anna and Harry
to act as public mediums for some time. The disturbances
had ceased by December 15, 1851 and, in the spring of 1852,
the family moved to New York.
The timid conservatism of Podmore in treating this case
shines so characteristically, that the writer is tempted to give

him a little space. P. 198 of Vol. I, he says: "Not one
of the marvels so far related is described by a person who
professes to have been actually present; and Professor Austin
Phelps' account was written nearly thirty years afterwards."
After inventing a lot of phenomena which he declares did
not occur, he relates the least remarkable of those which he
admits did occur, such as broken panes of glass, movement
of objects witnessed by Dr. Phelps, and the rapping. It is
a tour of logistics to draw a distinction without a difference
in the hope of discrediting an opponent in the eye of the
hasty reader. At the beginning of Chapter II,9 Podmore
discloses the whole weight of his argument: "Since, as shown
in a previous chapter, naughty little girls have for many
generations amused themselves and mystified their elders by
rapping on the foot of their wooden bedsteads and throwing
about the less expensive crockery, and the world has gone on
as before, we must look to something else. . . . The ex
planation
is,
of course, to be found in the conditions of the
time," etc.
But nothing serious has been adduced by Podmore to
prove that all the hubbub was created by the antics of little
girls. The present writer agrees heartily with the formula
that the explanation for the phenomena
is
to be found some
where
in
the public or prevalent psychology of the forties;
but where? Podmore assumes that everything
is
false
if
it
is
a
manifestation of psychology, whereas the writer believes
that our intelligence
is
evolved to the point of apprehending
hitherto unappreciated truths about the unseen.
The vogue of logical and scientific current assumptions or
rather prepossessions, perhaps, leans towards Podmore; but
to those who have been favored with private tests of the
supernormal, the facts justify the spiritistic belief in per
sonal survival, at least as
a
working hypothesis.

reaction to be noted in science and by giving the desired
slant to the facts. But the truth will work its way to
daylight. Podmore, in fact, was now a moth about the flame
of spiritualism, and, at last, he fell in, or was badly scorched.
To be convinced of this one needs only to turn over the
leaves of "The Newer Spiritualism," 1911. On p. 8, he
repeats the tale about naughty little girls, but at the end of
"The Newer Spiritualism" bursts into the open with the
manly concession that a real contribution to our scientific
knowledge has been made by the (more or less blind) efforts
of the spiritualists. I certainly could not ask another to
go further, although personally I subscribe to the spiritistic
hypothesis.
The present writer will have something more to say about
the mischief theory. He simply wishes to call attention to
the bridge over which Podmore is passing, taking the public
into his confidence as he proceeds, and, in a way, like some
eminent statesmen, acquiring his science by sheer attrition.
Indeed, the present writer would neither be didactic, nor
dogmatic, nor definitive. He agrees, to a certain extent,
with some remarks to be found on the last page of "Newer
Spiritualism": "Out of the long and tedious search, renewed
generation after generation, for the philosopher's stone and
the elixir of life, has come the wonder-working science of
modern chemistry. The seekers in the present case may have
been fooled by visionary gold, but at least they have been
digging in a very fruitful vineyard." Further, on the same
page, he intimates that telepathy (meaning non-spiritual
telepathy) is probably the real gold. With this limitation I
do not agree.
The bridge which has brought Podmore to the door of
veridicity, if not to that of immortality, is that of the cross-
correspondences. This means automatic scripts, written
simultaneously, sometimes by prearrangement, as an ex
periment, but always unwittingly, at different parts of the

world, which either piece out each other, in order to make
sense, or show some other necessary, logical connection. He
thinks that these are in the main due to coincidence or
"telepathy." Like some other philosophers, Podmore has
made a god of chance, and also assumes that telepathy can
not involve spirit mediation or participation, â€”the very point
to be proved. But in spite of the condemned evidence, he
admits: "The results add considerably to the strength of the
case for supernormal faculty of some kind." 10
"The evi
dence so far presented will not, it seems, admit of a positive
conclusion. But even whilst the investigation is still incom
plete, it is clear that the results so far attained are worth
all the labor that has been spent upon them." He goes so
far as to admit the possibility of spirit communication: "If
a final verdict must be deferred until further investigation
shall have enlightened our ignorance, and shall enable us to
give a decisive answer to the question whether these dark
sayings proceed from the dead or the living, we need not
wait to recognize that even now there are other, if perhaps
less momentous, issues involved which concern our imme
diate interests." 11
To these words it is not necessary to take radical excep
tion. Nothing in this world is fully and definitively proven.
One may believe one way, another the other, and yet both
agree that nothing is so fully proven that the case may not be
reopened. When we know more about ourselves here and
now, we shall know more about ourselves in the hereafter,
and also the other way about. When we shall finally know
just what we are, then will the riddle of immortality be
definitively solved. Meanwhile, we act upon our up-to-date
beliefs.

CHAPTER III
HYDESVILLE AND ROCHESTER
Outside of the painstaking, if overcautious, narrative of
Podmore, accounts of the Hydesville and Rochester happen
ings are not lacking, including those of E. W. Capron (1855),
who soon appeared on the scene at Rochester and was doubt
less intimately acquainted with many who had visited
Hydesville, and must have been there himself. Some thirty
or forty years later, Mrs. A. Leah Underhill, one of the three
medium sisters, wrote her recollections, the sincerity of which
is unquestioned. Another statement is to be found in R. D.
Owen's "Footfalls," (1860), and another in "Modern Ameri
can Spiritualism," by (Mrs.) Emma Hardinge (Britten)
(1870).1 These accounts will help us to render intelligible
to the reader the career of Katie Fox and her relation to the
automatic writing about which the present study centers.
In the spring of 1848, the Fox family were temporarily
living in a very modest house belonging to a hamlet in the
town of Newark, Wayne county, New York, known as
Hydesville. They had previously resided in Rochester, where
the oldest of the three Fox sisters, Leah Fox Fish, still
remained as a music teacher. The father, John D. Fox,
was building a home next to his son's, John S. Fox's, in
Arcadia, some three miles from Hydesville, which the family
proceeded to occupy later in the season, after most of the
phenomena had happened. They had moved into the Hydes
ville cottage, December 11, 1847. The family in residence
consisted of Mr. and Mrs. John D. Fox and their youngest
children, Margaretta, aged twelve, and Katherine, aged nine.

This is to adopt the ages given by Mr. Owen, who in later
years became so well acquainted with the family that his
statement is likely to be accurate. Katie's age has been
variously reported at ten and seven
2
and Margaretta's
always as three years older. Owen's account would put
Katie's birth in the year 1839.8
The poltergeist manifestations began on March 28th.
Before describing them, it should be said that there is
abundant evidence that such disturbances had been noticed
in the house previously; so that it can only be concluded,
from their subsequent intensity, that the presence of the
youthful mediums facilitated and furthered what had already
been established in principle. So long before as 1844, strange
noises were heard by Lucretia Pulver, who worked for the
Bells, the tenants of that time. She deposed, in April, 1848,
"I heard the knockings frequently, in the bedroom, under the
foot of the bed. . . . One night I thought I heard a man
walking in the buttery. ... It sounded as if a person walked
through the buttery down cellar (the cellar stairs led down
from the buttery) and part way across the cellar bottom,
and there the noise would cease."
The occupants previous to the Foxes were the Weekmans.
Mrs. Hannah Weekman deposed as to knocking on the door,
walking in the cellar, and her little girl saying, "that some
thing had been moving about over her head and face â€”that
it was cold." Mr. Michael Weekman, the father, deposed:
"My hand was on the door, and the knocking appeared to
be on the door. I could feel it jar with the raps. I instantly
opened the door and sprang out; but there was no one in
sight." On April 11th, Mrs. Margaret Fox deposed: "We
first heard the noise about a fortnight ago." (i.e., March
1 Hardinge, "American Spiritualism," p. 562.
8 "A Transcript from the Records of Deaths Reported to the Department
of Health of the City of New York" states that Katie Fox Jencken died
July 2, 1892, aged 53 years, at 609 Columbus Avenue. This statement puts
her birth in 1839, and we may assume it to be correct

28th) . . . "It was on Friday night, March 31st, that we
first called in the neighbors."
The succinct narrative in Owen's "Footfalls," p. 287, can
hardly be improved: The day had been cold and stormy,
with snow on the ground. . . . Wearied out by a succession
of sleepless nights and of fruitless attempts to penetrate the
mystery, the Fox family retired on that Friday evening very
early to rest, hoping for a respite from the disturbances that
harassed them. But they were doomed to disappointment.
The parents had had the children's beds removed into their
bedroom, and strictly enjoined them not to talk of noises,
even if they heard them. But scarcely had the mother seen
them safely in bed and was retiring to rest herself, when the
children cried out, "Here they are again." The mother chid
them and lay down. Thereupon the noises became louder
and more startling. The children sat up in bed. Mrs. Fox
called in her husband. The night being windy, it suggested
itself to him that it might be the rattling of the sashes. He
tried several, shaking them to see if they were loose. Kate,
the youngest girl, happened to remark that as often as her
father shook a window-sash the noises seemed to reply. Be
ing a lively child, and in a measure accustomed to what
was going on, she turned to where the noise was, snapped
her fingers, and called out, "Here, Old Splitfoot, do as I do!"
The knocking instantly responded.*
"It is not meant that it was Kate Fox who thus, half in
childish jest, first discovered that these mysterious sounds
seemed instinct with intelligence. Mr. Mompesson two hun
dred years ago (1661-1663) had already observed a similar
phenomenon. Glanvil had verified it. So had Wesley and his
children. So had others. But in all these cases the matter
rested there, and the observation was no further prosecuted.
As, previous to the invention of the steam-engine, sundry
observers had trodden the very threshold of the discovery

and there stopped, little thinking what lay close before them,
so in this case, where the Royal Chaplain, disciple though
he was of inductive philosophy, and where the founder of
Methodism, admitting though he did the probabilities of
ultramundane interference, were both at fault, a Yankee girl,
but nine years old, following up more in sport than earnest,
a chance observation, became the instigator of a movement
which, whatever its true character, has had its influence
throughout the civilized world. The spark had several times
been ignitedâ€”once, at least, two centuries ago; but it had
died out each time without effect. It kindled no flame till
the middle of the nineteenth century."
Kate Fox tried, by silently bringing together her thumb
and forefinger, whether she could still obtain a response.
Yes! It could see then, as well as hear! She called to her
mother. "Only look, Mother!" she said, bringing together
her finger and thumb, as before. And as often as she re
peated the noiseless motion, just so often responded the raps.
This at once arrested her mother's attention. "Count
ten," she said, addressing the noise. Ten strokes, distinctly
given! "How old is my daughter, Margaret?" Twelve
strokes! "And Kate?" Nine! "What can all this mean?"
was Mrs. Fox's thought. Who was answering her? Was
it only some mysterious echo of her own thought? But the
next question which she put seemed to refute that idea.
"How many children have I?" she asked, aloud. Seven
strokes. "Ah!" she thought, "it can blunder sometimes."
And then, aloud, "Try again !" Still the number of raps was
seven. Of a sudden a thought crossed Mrs. Fox's mind. "Are
they all alive?" she asked. Silence, for answer. "How many
are living?" Six strokes. "How many dead?" A single stroke.
Then she asked, "Are you a man?" No answer. "Are
you a spirit?" It rapped. "May my neighbors hear, if I
call them?" It rapped again.

all the tests to the crowd that it had to the little family, and,
by the mere process of yes or no, gave the details of a
murder alleged to have occurred in the house, four or five
years before.
Excavation in the cellar was at first frustrated by high
water of the neighboring creek, but Mrs. Underhill states
that later, in the summer, when the creek had subsided, her
brother John and others found charcoal, lime, and a few
pieces of bone under the point in the cellar indicated by
the raps. As no further legal evidence could be obtained
of the existence of the alleged murdered peddler, no legal
steps could be taken, and the verdict of ignoramus was prop
erly entered by the public and the authorities.
Owen pertinently remarks: "The Hydesville narrative,
however, as one of unexplained disturbances, like those at
Cidesville, at Slowensik, at Epworth, and at Tedworth, rests
for verification on the reality of the phenomena themselves,
not on the accuracy of the extrinsic information alleged to
be thereby supplied."
Through the aeons, "effort" has been the keynote of nature,
â€”effort to produce, first, inanimate, gaseous, fluid, crystal
line nature, then, effort to produce sensitive, animate nature,
effort to produce conscious nature, and finally effort to pro
duce self-conscious nature. While progress may be taken as
continuous and linear, there is here an apparent cycle, not
of repetition but of the original Force-thought doubling back
upon itself until, in self-consciousness, it acquires a knowl
edge of a small but homogeneous part of itself, through
the window afforded by the very limited and finite animal,
homo erectus, who had developed a capacity for personal
and racial progress.
Self-consciousness invites study of the duality of nature,
of the phenomenal world, and of the First Cause operating
also through the unseen world. Specifically, this trend has
sought formulation and significance through miracles, the

supernatural, mysticism, and fanaticism. To dismiss these
phenomena with the wave of the hand as "superstition" or
"merely imagination" is entirely beside the mark. Whatever
exists has its utility, even the apparent disutilities have their
utility. Disutility is essentially finite and illusory. In the
long run and from the airplane of higher dimensions, there
is no disutility.
Affecting this higher viewpoint, it becomes unscientific for
us to deny a purpose or at least a system to these phenomena.
And if they be purposive, their regular recurrence with in
creasing definiteness, running the gamut of nonsense and
culminating in a high order of sense, as the reader will be
able to certify, must throw a headlight upon the problem of
personality. For they bear all the marks of personality, and
yet they emerge apparently from a preparatory stage of the
impersonal; and this appears so whether we take the history
of the phenomena in the gross, or merely observe its re
capitulation in the development of the concrete, spiritualistic
seance.
In the case of any occurrences of whatsoever sort, it is
for the man to decide whether they interest him or not. If
he declares that they are worthy of his study, then all talk
of foolishness or imagination or superstition is out of place.
The next step of inquiry is to ascertain the precise viewpoint,
I may say, "dimensional" aspect, under which the occur
rences are to be considered. That is the real question. One
can understand the rejection of a study because the adopted
standard is too advanced for present purposes or for present
tools; but not because it is unreal or imaginary, for that
were to beg the question. The alternative, yes or no, true
or false, is very exciting and dramatic; but the more im
portant question
is,
"What
is
it
all about?" To answer that
we must go higher.

thusiasm of the Fox family and their neighbors and friends.
They found that almost any sound called for was returned
by the echoes.6 Before long it came out that the youngest
daughter, Katherine, was preferred by the spirits, or, to put
it more coldly, was most conducive to the communications.4
Clairvoyance had been known in former generations of the
Fox family. The remarkable thing about the new manifes
tations was the intelligence displayed. The Foxes themselves
were average persons, in education, station, and occupation.
Another distinguishing feature of their mediumship was its
enduring and sustained activity, as was later evidenced in
the sisters' whole lives.
In April, Mrs. Fish (later Underhill) took her youngest
sister, Katie, to her house in Prospect Street, Rochester,
N. Y., not a long journey from Hydesville. In her previously
occupied house in Mechanics Square, Mrs. Fish, who was a
music teacher, had been treated to a regular minstrel show
by way of poltergeist. But description fails of what took
place in the Prospect Street house. There the leading repre
sentations were of all the sounds produced in a carpenter's
shop. Apparently a coffin was first made and then shoved
about the room. But deeds followed the aural pantomime.
The throwing of "pickets from the discarded lots in the
cemetery, an entire distance of two hundred feet" was a real,
material performance. The Foxes communicated these
troubles to the Post, Bush, and Granger families. The Fish
(Fox) family was much opposed to the disturbances, and
prayed for them to stop. Pins were stuck into them as they
prayed. "My little sister, Katie, would sometimes say, 'I
can't pray; I feel more like swearing.'

munication. At Rochester, Isaac Post suggested that the
same procedure be followed. This was exactly what "the
spirits" wanted, and almost the first communication by
"raps" or "echoes" was the following comparatively long
one: "Dear friends, you must proclaim these truths to the
world. This is the dawning of a new era; and you must
not try to conceal it any longer. When you do your duty,
God will protect you; and good Spirits will watch over you." *
"God's telegraph antedated that of Samuel F. B. Morse." 9
On account of the poltergeist noises, Mrs. Fish was ejected
from the Prospect Street house, but secured one in Troup
Street, to which she moved, September 1, 1849. No fees
for sittings were accepted for two years after the Hydesville
incident.10 The unpopularity of spiritualism (outside of its
numerous adherents) made it more and more difficult for our
somnambules to gain a living, so that the novel career of
professional mediumship was the resource indicated by cir
cumstances.
Meanwhile, the Foxes desiring privacy, the rapping Force
called for publicity. In another circle, the voice of Benjamin
Franklin was heard, in raps. A sign was asked as proof that
the communicator was really Benjamin Franklin. The
medium was a member of the family where the test occurred.
After a silence of one or two minutes, a violent shock of
her person induced one hastily to say, "What is the matter?
Are you waking up?" A. "No, you wanted a signal, and
I told him, if it was Dr. Franklin, he might electrize me,
and he did it." Q. "Has it injured you?" A. "No, I feel
better; my head is clearer â€” I can see plainer."
Mr. Capron lived in Auburn; but in Rochester the first
circle was formed of a compact body of convinced, intelligent
persons. They decided that the desire of the newly revealed,
deceased personalities must be followed. There ensued a

series of three public meetings, in Corinthian Hall, Rochester.
The results were mainly negative; only a few raps under
the very adverse circumstances; but positive in the sense
that all the three committees were unable to prove or even
allege fraud, although a crowd of rowdies, at the last meeting,
created a rough-house, but were finally subdued by the prompt
action of the Chief of Police. In New York City, a couple
of years later, the Chief of Police again vindicated his
title to keeper of the peace, even as the Roman soldiers had
guarded a Greater One in the garden of Gethsemane. Leah
and Maggie were the mediums at the Corinthian Hall meet
ings. Katie was, meanwhile, at the home of Mr. Capron,
in Auburn, where her mediumistic faculties were freely
exercised.
From the day the public investigation ended, the excite
ment increased. It spread, by the press, from one end of
the Union to the other, and was soon reechoed from the other
side of the Atlantic.
The first meeting at Corinthian Hall was on November 14,
1848.11 The next meeting heard the reports of the commit
tee appointed at the first meeting; the third, the report of
the second. A committee was appointed at the third meet
ing, but had no report to make, as there were no phenomena.
They thereupon adjourned to a hotel for dinner, and were
joking the mediums, whom they invited to the dinner, when
the heavy dining table was lifted above their heads by
unseen power.11
If Katie had been present at the Corinthian Hall meetings,
perhaps the manifestations would have been stronger, espe
cially those before the committees, in separate session. But
of course, it cannot be believed that her presence could have
overcome the general prejudice. The manifestations before

were also weak; but in each case sufficient to furnish material
of a contentious nature.
The visit of Katie and her mother to Mr. Capron's at
Auburn, during the Corinthian Hall meetings, resulted in a
tremendous, unregulated craze in the town which the press
stimulated by printing the most outrageous lies about the
genuine manifestations. Through a Mrs. Benedict, as
medium, directions were given to James L. Scott, a Seventh
Day Baptist clergyman of Brooklyn, New York, to repair
to Auburn, where he and the Rev. T. L. Harris, of New York
City, started the Apostolic movement, which was continued
as a colony at Mountain Cove, Virginia. It was quite in
line with the vogue of those days to attempt to carry out
social reform in Utopian style by means of a colony or com
munity: witness, Brook Farms, the Shakers, New Harmony,
financed by Robert Owen, father of Robert Dale Owen, and
many other community movements. Perhaps the Mormons
may be put in that series, on a large scale. Anyhow, a
sporadic, unsuccessful attempt was made to impute sex
aberration to Spiritualists, on the Mormon precedent. The
Mountain Cove community was a wretched failure; its
leaders were unbalanced enthusiasts. The present writer re
members the Rev. Mr. Scott as a patient of his father's for
the morphine habit. His eye had an abnormal glitter; he
never uttered a word. His prophecies and communings with
the Almighty were at last locked in his own breast. That
was probably in the late sixties.
If Katie was the innocent crystallization point of preva
lent near insanity for which she was in nowise responsible
and with which she, a child of nine, could be charged with
no possible solidarity, the rapid spread of a rational spiritu
alism is undoubtedly to be put especially to the credit of
her spontaneous mediumship. Leah never suspected that
she herself was a medium until after the Hydesville dis
turbances; but she possessed a latent faculty through which

she soon came to her sisters' aid. Maggie was also a strong
medium, but perhaps her will was more obtrusive. At any
rate, Katie was generally agreed to be the best medium in
that family where the metapsychic power first took on a de
cisive, definite, and permanent personality. The fame of
her familiarity with a world that had heretofore been ghostly
and hypothetical, and since the authoritative cessation of
miracles, theoretical, had permeated American society and
penetrated other fands.
The claim was later made that the Spiritualists in the
United States numbered ten millions, say a quarter or more
of the population. Extravagant as this may seem, and it
was undoubtedly an exaggeration, it must be remembered
that effective Spiritualists are today to be found in all the
Protestant churches, as well as outside of them, who do not
admit that they are Spiritualists. They do not wish to be
classed with avowed Spiritualists, nor to share the certain
opprobrium to which a belief is peculiarly exposed which in
vites infinite degrees of credulity, and submits to scientific
test about the results of which science has not been able
to give definite answers nor set up definite standards.
Mrs. Fish (Underhill) says: "Mother thought the former
(Katie) to be the one most followed by the sounds." 11
The
voice of B. Franklin says: "There is but one Katie. We
cannot work with another." 14
This on the eve of Katie's
departure for Europe, 1872. Any one knowing Katie, at
this time, as did the writer, would ridicule the idea that
advertising ever entered her head. If she believed in a
future life, if she lived apparently in the body, but always
ready to step out of
it,
she was the last person
in
the world
to be concerned about her economic and worldly future.
Care did not enter her thoughts. To the end, she subsisted
on manna brought by the birds.

The business brains of the family belonged to Mrs. Fish
(Underhill). It was she who decided what ought to be done,
and who kept the mother and two gifted little sisters con
tinually by her side until the latter were too old for tute
lage." Capron says, "If ever this (spiritualism) proves a
real and permanent blessing to mankind, the name of Ann
Leah Brown 18
should stand conspicuous as one of the hero
ines of history, who fought the battle against a world of
opposition, while her younger sisters were the only media,
and after she became so herself." "
The Fox family thus suddenly found themselves monopo
lists of a commodity for which the phrase of "Coin," Harvey,
"an unlimited demand," is not inappropriate. There was
really nothing left for them to do but to put this ware upon
the market. They were become very unwillingly so famous
that no one would have thought of them in any other asso
ciation of ideas than the metapsychic. Practically, all other
avenues of gainful living were closed to them. Added to
all this was the consciousness of their own unprejudiced im
partiality and freedom from superstition, and the consequent
deep conviction that something of value to mankind lay
behind all the miraculous pother.
The Foxes, chaperoned by their mother, journeyed to New
York in June, 1850, where, on the 4th of the month, they
put up at Barnum's Hotel, at the corner of Broadway and
Maiden Lane. They decided to hold seances daily, in the
parlor of the hotel, to which the public was admitted at the
" Tylor fails to make the distinction between the hierophant and the
founder. "The system of working an alphabet by counted raps is a device
familiar to prison cells. . . . Thus, when, in 1847, the celebrated rappings
began to trouble the town of Arcadia in the State of New York, the Fox
family of Rochester, founders of the modern spiritual movement, had, on
the one hand, only to revive the ancient, prevalent belief in spirit-rappings,
which had almost fallen into the limbo of discredited superstitions, while,
on the other hand, the system of communication with the spirits was ready
made to their hand." "Primitive Culture," Vol. I, p. 146.

uniform charge of one dollar. The visitors were assembled
in the same room with the mediums, and while each one was
given separate attention, all were privy to whatever occurred.
Horace Greeley was the first caller, and never, to the end of
his life, failed to testify to the sincerity of the little mediums,
and to maintain a fatherly attitude toward them. There
arose an intimacy between the families; and the Foxes at
times occupied the Greeley home in New York City or at
Chappaqua.
Greeley interested himself particularly that Katie's school
ing, sadly interrupted, should not be neglected. Dr. Elisha
Kent Kane, the Arctic explorer, was the one to send Maggie to
school, only his motives were less disinterested than Greeley's.
Mr. Ripley, of the New York Tribune, gave impartial ac
counts of the first seances, and the Tribune never varied
from its attitude of fairness. Horace Greeley himself wrote
the following editorial, which it would be well for our latter-
day editors to take to heart :
. . . "And it would be the basest cowardice not to say
that we are convinced beyond a doubt of their (the Foxes')
perfect integrity and good faith in the premises. What
ever may be the cause or the origin of the 'rappings,' the
ladies in whose presence they occur do not make them. . . .
We believe that fully three-fourths are convinced, as we are,
that these singular sounds and seeming manifestations are
not produced by Mrs. Fox and her daughters nor by any
human being connected with them. H. G." "
"Mr. Greeley often said, on the strength of her childish
letters: 'Katie, I expect to see you develop into another
Margaret Fuller some day, if you will only give your atten
tion to study.'

so that they might obtain the means of
living. Many of their friends advised this course, as did
also their invisible attendants.
A
tour was arranged, including Buffalo, Cleveland, Cincin
nati, and St. Louis. The mass of mankind loves to put its
own, offhand interpretation on visible events.
It

a
position so for
tuitously gained, with reluctance and obstinacy born of men
tal inadaptability, which even prolonged education and much
exercise of the faculty of thought sometimes fail to correct.
To repeat all the wild theories and insane ravings that accom
panied the spiritualistic wave would turn us from our
course.20 The Fox tour was calculated, on the one hand, to
bring back the energumenes of psychologic enthusiasm into
the paths of moderation and, on the other hand, to confirm
the rational minded who suspected that there was some fire
behind all the smoke.
The episode of the Buffalo doctors,21 however, brought the
Foxes face to face with unscientific science in
a
right dis
agreeable form. In Buffalo,
a
self-appointed committee of
three doctors, all professors in the Buffalo medical school,
assumed the benevolent purpose of stemming the popular
craze, as did certain eminent Harvard professors not many
years afterward. Dr. Austin Flint was one of America's
first surgeons. With him were associated Drs. Lee and
Coventry. Mrs. (Fish) Underhill writes that their report,
charging the mediums with making the noises by cracking
their knee joints, was written before any investigation had
been made. This report has done infinite harm,

lulled the minds of the busy burghers into the easy con
clusion that the imposition had been discovered and the
humbug exposed. Today, misinformation on this subject is
still prevalent. The country was soon supplied with itinerant
"lecturers" who demonstrated that the sounds could be pro
duced, according to some by the toes, according to others
by the knees, or by the shoulders, or by the jaw bone,22
or by the knuckles. The discrepancies of the kneeologists
and toeologists helped to justify the mediums.
Leah pluckily wrote a letter about the report of the doctors
to the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser, of March 14, 1851:
"As professional men, whose reputation is dear to them, I
would like to have them tell your readers, what condition
our poor joints would be in by this time, after three years'
constant service in this almost ceaseless operation. I will
not call this 'quackery,' but will leave it to the public to
pass judgment on their professional erudition."
Mrs. Patchen was the instance cited by the doctors to
prove the possibility of cracking the knee joint, "But it was
with great effort and very painful to herself, and the con
sequences of her having exhibited it to a committee at our
rooms was that she was confined for about a week."
23
If
Moliere had only been a spiritualist!
The New York Tribune suggested, "that as the Buffalo
doctors had confessedly prejudged the case before they had
tried it and determined that the Rochester ladies were 'hum
bugging females,' before they saw them, it might have been
â€¢as well to have entrusted the trial to somewhat more im
partial judges. . . . Whilst any raps that were heard in
parts of the room removed from the mediums, the learned
doctors undertook to affirm were not heard there, only ap
peared to be so heard," etc."

62 KATIE FOX
From Buffalo Leah took her sisters to Cleveland and to
Cincinnati. In both cities their seances were crowded, and
great enthusiasm for the new spiritualism prevailed. John
W. Gray, editor of the Cleveland Plaindealer, proved as
stanch a friend as Horace Greeley. A medal was presented
to Leah at Cleveland, and at Cincinnati a medal to Maggie
and a watch to Katie, with the following inscription: "Miss
Katherine Fox: The individuals whose names are hereunto
attached, having faith in your integrity, as a testimonial of
their regard for you personally," etc. There were eleven
signers."
In Cleveland, a remarkable communication was obtained
from the voice of B. Franklin.26 Since Katie was but twelve
years old, and her school days had been seriously interrupted
by her mediumship, we may safely conclude that the follow
ing thoughts are not to be credited to her childish philosophy.
The so-called "telepathic" theory teaches that they must have
come from some of the sitters. While this sort of explanation
was and is more or less current and receives some color, per
haps, from garbled passages of the Record, it is open to the
reader to weigh the probability of the sitters' training and
preparation spontaneously to summon and arrange for ex
pression, consciously or unconsciously, thought of the follow
ing order:
"Spirit is the great positive element of being; matter the
great negative. There is an elemental difference between
matter and spirit. Electricity and magnetism are intimately
connected with matter and belong to it. There is a dividing
link between matter and mind, compounded of electricity and
magnetism, yet finer than either, called vitality or life. There
are various degrees of refinement in magnetism. Chemical
affinities, cohesion, and gravitation " are properties of elec-

tricity and magnetism. Repulsion is caused by stronger
attraction. The ascension of a balloon from earth is an illus
tration of this principle.
"Everything in the universe takes (its appropriate) place
by virtue of its elemental affinities, and can occupy no other
place without changing the relation of itself and every other
atom (body) in existence. The earth and every other body
in space moves in its orbit by the united action of every other
body (and cannot be made to come in contact with other
bodies), the combining influence of all and each, separately
and conjointly, acting upon each other (mark out separate
paths for each). Thought is mental motion and is converged
from one mind to another by an intermediate medium, which
is put into action by the mind. This medium (in its refine
ment from the nervous fluid to spirit) is the element of
vitality or life. Clairvoyance consists in insulating the mind
of the subject, and in proportion as the mind is brought into
clear contact with higher refinements of this medium, will
the subject become clear-sighted. 'Biology,' as used by Burr
and others, is an improper term. 'Psychology' would be a
better word. The word 'biology' was used to make the sub
ject a humbug. The phenomena attending psychological
(biological) experiments belong to the lower class of mesmeric
influences â€”and pass from them through every degree to per
fect clear-sightedness." 28
Nature was to be a closed circuit
without elasticity.
About this time, the rigorous school of physicists, instance
Dubois Raymond, was in ascendancy. "Telepathic" theory
would ascribe to itself a part of this script, while spiritualistic
hypothesis would reverse the nexus, and ascribe the current
stage of physical philosophy, including the universal casuality
of Dubois, to the same ingenerence that assumed the voice of
Franklin. No countenance is volunteered, however, to the

theory that telepathy is accomplished through personal
(spirit) messengers.
The ascribing of atomic determination to electrical action
would seem to be in anticipation of comparatively recent,
physical, inferential reasoning, while the principle enounced
of bringing the mind of the medium by insulation into con
tact with higher and higher fields of spiritual action recalls
to us not only the dogma of theosophy but also the recent
speculations upon relativity.
The next development of the phenomena, automatic writ-
. ing, appears to have taken place in Cincinnati. Hence, the
Franklin text just above presented, as at Cleveland, would
have been communicated by raps. It illustrates the facility
which the Foxes had attained to in this clumsy method of
communication. As Leah writes, there was little or no
fatigue connected with it. The medium half-sensed what was
coming. The present writer has often remarked how Katie
would finish a message of echoes before it was audibly half
done. But, for longer impartings, the method by echoes was
not only laborious to the medium, but also so tedious to the
sitter as to be forbidding, so that the abiding usefulness of
the spiritualistic oracle demanded the more certain and
definite method through writing.
As the communications "are now generally made, the
mediums are being spiritually magnetized and becoming
obedient to spiritual direction in writing or point out letters
on a large alphabet; or, as is more frequently the case, after
half an hour's quiet sitting in a circle of eight or a dozen
persons, who form a battery by uniting their hands, the
medium is magnetized, and, it is affirmed, taken possession
of by the spirits, who use her organs of speech in talking to
the company." "
The order of development of psychic phenomena observed
by Capron was as follows:

particularly hard "to detect

The Fox sisters, especially Katie, afford
a
standard by which to gauge the general evolution. Doubtless
Capron had them
in
mind.
Twelve hundred mediums were recognized in Cincinnati.
There were fifty-nine organized circles. After the "Fox girls
visited Cincinnati, men and women became insane, but that,
instead of allaying the excitement, had quite the contrary
effect." 81
The prediction was made that mediums would
soon talk and write.82
It
would appear that automatic writing
was ushered in by the practice of employing an artificial
hand which, in the grasp of the medium, pointed out printed
letters, thus obviating the necessity of calling the letters of
the alphabet.88
The next steps in the economy of communication would be
possession and automatic writing. For the latter Katie soon
became
a
past master. Editors and voluminous authors are
eminent for their concentration and intensity.

watched Katie at work, and talked with her when her left
hand was adding to the miles of sheets of mirror-writing
that she made for his family, that common fairness of mind
and decent logic make it impossible for him to doubt the
spiritistic hypothesis, with the maturer reservation that we
must be careful not to accept an ingenuous conception of
what personality may be.
That is a subject for further reflection. Admitting inability
adequately to analyze personality, whatever it may be, we
know that it was not Katie's personality that did the writing.
Doubtless, close scrutiny of the phenomena may lead us to
conclude that personality is not the absolute datum which
the men of the sixties assumed it to be. It may be, for in
stance, that there is really no personality, in the old sense,
but that a man is compact of personalities, in the plural, or
of abstract qualities, in a new sense. Very well. It still
holds that it was not the same degree of personality, specifi
cally speaking, which wrote the manuscripts of Katie or of
Andrew Jackson Davis, and the novels of Scott or the
philosophy of Kant.
While we are in the West of the fifties, let us take occasion
to relate briefly one extraordinary case of poltergeist which
occurred two or three years afterwards, and continued some
time. In Athens Co., Ohio," a drive of seventeen miles from
Columbus, one farmer named Koons and another named
Tippie, living a few miles apart, had each hyperphysical
experiences which induced them, probably cognizant of the
prevailing wave of spiritualistic occurrences and hysteria, to
advance their openings of unusual happenings to the stage of
systematic regularity.
Not, apparently, with any design of emolument but simply
filled with true revivalist ardor, they each built a little house
of one room dedicated to poltergeist phenomena, which did
not fail to present themselves in extraordinary amplitude.

Not solos but whole orchestras of music (or, anyhow, instru
mentation) greeted the ears of the few who were admitted to
the sittings, while materializations of hands and arms were
a regular part of the performance. There were also com
munications stating that these exercises were in due course
of a revival in the world of spiritual life.85
Nothing is easier than to mistake one's own convictions,
especially those reached under a revival that bordered on
ecstasy, for inspiration or, at least, for something so self-
evident that the unconvinced world is looked upon as erring
or sinful, willfully obstinate or maliciously obstructive to
truth. The reaction of this attitude on the shocked majority
of those days led to a view on their part placing the spiritual
ists on a level with free-lovers, revolutionists, and criminals.
The lack of balance appeared to be the same and also the
social danger. The revelations, said the conservative press
and clergy, "teach the overthrow of existing church organiza
tions, and say that vital changes must be made in the social
and commercial world. The belief in the spiritual agency
of these teachings being quite general, and becoming more so
every day, the effect will be, as we previously stated, to form
a great radical party, which will develop itself erelong, and
astonish the world by its strength."
36
The radical, Republican party, of those days, in a way
answered to this description, and spiritualism was quite a
radical move in itself. But the Fox sisters, and especially
Katie, were immune to all bad influences of revivalism.
Katie was as ignorant as a vegetable of the social tendencies
which surrounded her mediumship. No social theory of any
kind either progressive or alarmist ever entered her head.
She knew that her life work was cut out for her by the
spontaneous functioning of her mediumship, and in that shÂ«
was content to live and die.

CHAPTER IV
NEW YORK
New York became Katie's permanent home. The only
important subsequent change of residence was registered by
the years of married life spent in London.
In 1851, the Cleveland Plaindealer contained the item:
"It is well known that Catherine Fox, a child of some dozen
summers, is at present and has been for some time stopping
in the family of Horace Greeley in New York." It goes on
to relate that Jenny Lind called on her there and obtained
communications through her, in Miss Lind's native tongue.
In January, 1852, Mrs. Leah Fox Brown, as she was then
called, moved from Rochester to New York. Her sisters,
Maggie and Katie, naturally looked to her home as theirs, al
though they did not permanently live with her, being inde
pendently supported by their fees as mediums. Leah's first
house was in West 26th Street, where she lived for two years.
She then lived for a year in 1 5th Street, near Irving Place, and
then for four years at No. 1 Ludlow Place. This chronology
brought her to the year 1858, when she married Wm. Under
bill. Their home, when my parents knew them, was in West
37th Street, while ours was in the next street. As I recall,
there was no great intimacy between the two families. Mr.
and Mrs. Fox, Sr., also came to New York and occupied the
house of Horace Greeley, who made his home with them when
he was in the city.
Leading citizens, in those days, were more prompt to
acknowledge their belief in spiritualism than are those of
today. The times are different. It was not precisely that
men were more outspoken, although it is true that they were
a little closer to the period of heresy and inquisition, when

men seemed possessed to brave a martyr's death, on the
most hair-splitting, logical distinctions. It was, perhaps,
rather that men believed they had not fully committed them
selves, and that the way was open gracefully to renounce the
new creed, if faith failed. While the opposition was bitter,
it had the weakness of anger and invited the scorn of the
elite of those who took an open stand for spiritualism.
Today, the lines are more narrowly drawn, so that neither
party feels so absolutely cocksure as formerly. The telep-
athists seem to have things their own way, up to a certain
point. Their assumption errs by excess of simplicity of
assertion and complexity, not to say impossibility, of demon
stration and by overdemand upon our credulity, in one, set
direction. A narrow field is acknowledged for veridicity.
The Hudsonian telepathist is not constrained to deny the fact
of all the metapsychic phenomena; but he can positively
argue only for the molecular, and fails to score an explana
tion when molar phenomena are adduced. On the other
hand, the spiritualists must often pause to doubt whether
phenomena purporting to arise from a disembodied or in
visible spirit be not really a product of the silent workings
of their own personality or of a personality included within
their own or somehow attached to it. The riddle of per
sonality was not to be solved by one stroke at the Gordian
Knot, as men then hoped.
The class of men and women who stood at the forefront of
the early spiritualist movement has not been surpassed in
any socioreligious movement, anywhere. It is the same class
which today has, in many countries, shifted over into
"psychical research," a term which better expresses what
that group has always stood for and what the present times
call for: men whose beliefs are subordinated to their knowl
edge; and whose knowledge is in a cautious state of "moving
equilibrium." The names of the Advisory Scientific Council

side the cover of their Journal, are a sufficient guaranty that
what made much noise in the fifties is now receiving the
patient study which all phenomena of personality and many
phenomena of psychology deserve. One notices a dozen col
lege professors and a number of physicians, clergymen, and
literary men, twenty in all. Patient research is the watch
word.
In those days, it was the same class of up-to-date citizens
who were called upon to break the ground. We are told that
Mrs. Fish, and the two younger sisters, met, in the spring of
1850, at the chambers of the Rev. Dr. Griswold, in Broad
way, J. Fenimore Cooper, Geo. Bancroft, Rev. Dr. Hawks,
Dr. J. W. Francis, Dr. Marcy, Mr. N. P. Willis, William
Cullen Bryant, Mr. Bigelow, of the Evening Post, Richard
B. Kimball, H. T. Tuckermann, Gen. Lyman.1
Some of these men were of national reputation, and all very
influential in New York City.2 Mr. George Ripley, one of
the editors of the New York Tribune, reported the meeting
in that paper: "We were present on Thursday evening at a
party of gentlemen who had been invited to the chambers of
the Rev. Dr. Griswold in Broadway, to meet the Rochester
ladies, whose connection with the mysterious knockings has
called forth such a general curiosity. The party had been
arranged by Dr. Griswold who has been incredulous from the
first with regard to any preternatural character in the mani
festations. . . .
". . . The raps were loud and distinct, and various mem
bers of the party conversed by means of the alphabet." The
account closes: "The manners and bearing of the ladies are
such as to create a prepossession in their favor. They have
no theories to offer in explanation of the acts of their mys
terious attendants, and apparently have no control of their
incomings and outgoings." The author Cooper and N. P.
i "Hardinge," p. 63.
2N. P. Willis stated, in the Home Journal, in 1853, that there were
40,000 spiritualists in New York City and three hundred circles.

Willis later became spiritualists." The last statement does
not imply that the others were not convinced, but only that
they did not join the militant party.
Of the militant spiritualists perhaps the foremost were
Charles Partridge and Judge J. W. Edmonds. Mr. Partridge
was a merchant. He subventioned a newspaper, the Spiritual
Telegraph, May 8, 1852, with help of Rev. S. B. Britain.
The name was significant of the recent invention of the
telegraph. The previous February, Mr. Britain had begun
to preach at Hope Chapel, Brooklyn. Spiritualism was al
ready a sect, a religion. Mr. Partridge was active (1854) in
founding the Society for the Diffusion of Spiritual Knowl
edge.* The Society engaged Miss Kate Fox, "at a liberal
salary, to hold daily seances through rapping, writing, and
the phases of mediumship peculiar to her, at which the public
were admitted each morning from ten to one." Katie was
but fifteen years old. Miss Emma Hardinge, a recent arrival
from England and actress at the Broadway Theatre, had
become a medium, and assisted as such at the seances. A
few years later, free circles were held in New York, by Laura
Edmonds,5 J. B. Conklin, Kate Fox, and Emma Hardinge,8
supported by Mr. Partridge and the Society.
Perhaps a still more outstanding figure than Mr. Par
tridge was that of Judge J. W. Edmonds, the father of Laura
Edmonds. He began his investigation in January, 1851. He
was an eminent, large-minded man. He had been a member
of the New York State Senate, had served as judge of the
New York Court for the Correction of Errors, as Justice of
the New York Supreme Court, and as judge of the Court of
Appeals. "A gentleman of finished classical education. . . .

bitterly attacked by the National Intelligencer of Washing
ton and, on account of the insinuations in that article, if not
elsewhere, that his belief in spiritualism was unfavorable to
his poise and impartiality as a judge, he resigned his seat on
the Court of Appeals in order to throw his whole influence
into the scales for the spiritualistic faith. Probably not only
his other investigations but also the first hand experience with
his own daughter, were decisive with him.
The newspapers, the Evening Mirror and the New York
Courier, noticed his resignation with kind remarks eulogistic
of his personal character and public services. In September,
1853, appeared a volume, Spiritualism, by Judge Edmonds
and Dr. Dexter, and a second volume, the following year.
Judge Edmonds was, perhaps, the chief mouthpiece of spirit
ualism. October 19, 1867, he delivered the first of a course
of twenty-eight lectures on spiritualism at Music Hall, Bos
ton, where the late Theodore Parker had preached. Born in
1799, he died in 1874.
Another prominent national character in spiritualism was
Governor N. P. Tallmadge of Wisconsin. In a letter to Hon.
Jas. F. Simmons, Gov. Tallmadge pays a high tribute to the
character of Judge Edmonds.
In February, 1853, Mrs. Fox, Margaret and Katherine
visited Washington, where already, the previous year, much
interest in their faculty of spirit communication had been
manifested. Hon. A. P. Hascall of LeRoy, New York, who
had been on one of the first investigating committees at Co
rinthian Hall and had seemed satisfied with the veridicity of
the phenomena, had made a speech entirely contradicting his
previously expressed views.
From the Collamore House, New York City, April 30,
1853, Governor Tallmadge, influenced by his attendance on
the seances of the Foxes, wrote his answer: "If there ever

expression of my surprise that intelligent minds can be found
to denounce those who do investigate them." 8
Governor
Tallmadge went on to explain the odic force of Reichenbach
and to refute the charge that persons went insane over spirit
ualism. The refutation was partly by avoidance, as the law
yers say: that
is,
by claiming that as many go insane over
religion.9 He quotes further,
a
communication from theV
spirit of John C. Calhoun (1782-1850)
:
"
'We, by our united
will, acting upon spirits clothed in flesh, influence them to
perform duties which benefit mankind.'
" 10
There
is
a
quasi-materialist theory, which
is
one of the
bridges that cautious men of science are crossing and which
leads to spiritualism, to the effect that telepathic influences
are constantly sweeping about the surface of earth and in
fluencing directly our mentality, doubtless through ap
propriate organs, and that these influences are somehow
resultants or composites of the mental action of groups of
individuals or of all the individuals, let us say, that count.
Does the Calhoun script mean this? Evidently not precisely,
for
it
expressly refers to the combined wills of spirits.
It
is,
moreover, just conceivable that, as spirits may be
supposed, provisionally and very theoretically, to receive
their impressions from, by, or through the same Dinge an
sich as we, only by
a
different route, so they may believe that
our thoughts are their thoughts, and thus that they are in
fluencing what we are doing. Another still more materialist
hypothesis would be that the medium
is
really inspired by
quite human and telepathic effluvia, only (as in this case)
attaching them to the name of the recently deceased states
man.
However, to those of us who think the straight, spiritistic

theory simpler, the thought will occur that the conditions of
the fourth dimension are far more favorable to generalization
than are those prevailing here. The ideas that seem the
height of generalization here, present themselves to the other-
worldlings as quite specific; but the latter are, in turn, privy
to concepts of a still higher degree of generality. Relatively
metapsychic attribution for the origin of general concepts is
the plausible one.
How, then, does it stand with the personality of the de
ceased? Looking at the matter from what light we have, it
would appear that, in the fourth dimension, the personality
would tend to be absorbed or rather merged, to a degree, into
a higher inclusive personality, a great flow of will and con
viction headed in a given direction, but still, perhaps, con
cerned in that vortex of Being, the Earth. But this merger
would not be continuous nor would it ever be complete.
There is abundant indication in the Record to support such
an hypothesis. The ecstasy of the mystic would anticipate
the voluntary merger. The frequent injunction, "Call us not
back," or, "We have our duties which we must obey," or, "We
have received commands which we cannot disobey," speaks
of more than mortal obligation, of that which is instinct,
rather, with self-surrender.
Following this train of thought to a further inference, we
discover this difference between personality in the third and
that in the fourth-dimension : in the fourth-dimension, "per
sonality" defines a power still residing in the spirit to detach
itself, under appropriate circumstances, and dissociate itself
from the spiritual block; whereas terrestrial society results
from a power of the spirit to fuse itself into the whole, where
all spirits are casually amalgamated, say, in order to set social

of Calhoun's "I'm with you still." It is further stated that
the use of the abbreviation, "I'm" was habitual with Calhoun.
The interest at Washington reached such a pitch, that ill-
advised enthusiasm believed that government sanction could
be won through the instituting of a congressional investiga
tion. Nothing could be more outside of the competence of
Congress or more foreign to the spirit of our constitution.
This was not the last time to throw it to the winds. It
is surprising that Governor Tallmadge lent his name to the
idea; but quite natural that Senator Shields should not find
any good reason for refusing to present a petition bearing
13,000 signatures and asking for the appointment of a scien
tific commission. If, indeed, the matter could have been
entertained by the politicians with the cold eye of science,
the request would not have been so unreasonable. But psy
chology and bio-physics were not then so advanced as today,
although it must be admitted that men like Edmonds, Tall
madge, and Capron did not allow themselves to be carried
away by sentimentalism.
It is not, then, to be wondered at that the Hon. James
Shields seized the occasion to play politics by delivering a
comic oration, not unlike in tone to that famous one of Hon.
Mr. Breckenridge, on the granting of a subsidy to a railroad
to Superior City, Wisconsin. Briefly, Shields put the whole
movement on a par with the alchemists and magicians, men
tioning Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, Dr. Dee, the Rosi-
crucians, and Cagliostro. He had superficially documented
himself. The comparisons were not so bad, had they only
been infused with the spirit of evolution and of construction
in place of trifling, ridicule, and obstruction.
After humorous motions to refer the petition to the com
mittees on foreign relations, on military affairs, or on post-
roads, it was laid on the table. But Governor Tallmadge was
not the man to drop the affair at that point and accept the
snub. A spirited exchange of letters with Senator Shields

still is the task of inducing science to condescend to interest
itself in still another and novel group.
There is the stage of denial, during which science disbe
lieves in all relations and reports; then the stage of violent
anger, when science is constrained to admit that something
has happened which it finds hard to force into the existing
pigeon-holes. The chief trouble for science is to regalvanize
the plasticity and resiliency of its brain; and this is a truly
purgatorial agony; but it makes for progress. This stage
comports sundry, subordinate stadia, such as recognition of
good faith and veridicity, remaking of terminology, such as
"psychology," wrestling with problems of mind vs. matter,
admitting the various classes of phenomena to the scientific
aristocracy, one at a time, denying and then acceding to some
relation between them, creating a working hypothesis which
shall shock as little as possible already accepted hypotheses
in most divergent lines, and so forth.
Now, in all this tension of brains, perhaps the hardest
struggle comes at the point where Science has to part com
pany with Vogue. For, at first blush, Science views the
phenomena not through the eyes of Revival but of Vogue,
that is to say, of that part of the community conservative
enough or dumb enough, anyhow, cautious enough, to refuse
to be carried along in the mad rush of sentiment. Indeed,
most of society remains inert simply because it has not come
in contact with the phenomena. But the attitude of this
portion, being that which affords stability, is quite decisive
with Science, which has generally seen too much of insta
bility, already.
The first impulse, therefore, of your dyed-in-the-wool man
of science is to warn the public to be cautious, and to seek
to stem the tide of apparently heedless revivalism. Only
thus can science hold its position of preeminent respecta
bility. Were standards lost, the world of thought and of
mind-building would rapidly become disordered and lapse

into gibbering chaos. At the height of psychologic crises,
science throws knowledge and research to the winds. It
flatly refuses to inquire further. It warns the dear public
of the danger of attempting to wander where Science has
not yet staked out the trail. The conservative, however,
must be radical on some subject.
And were Science completely successful with its danger
signals, Truth wrings the confession that Science would lie
down for a beauty sleep. It is lucky, therefore, that society
often harbors some convinced persons who, at such periods
of reaction, insist upon action, and more action. That these
comeouters are not, peradventure, recruited from the ranks
of science does not exactly per se convict them of inferior
understanding. Many of these convinced ones are far from
being the brainless enthusiasts often represented, but men
who in calmness amid turmoil and banality, have thought
out a satisfactory system. Such were Hare, Capron, Ed
monds, Tallmadge, Owen, not to mention others equally
deserving.
In the hallowed precincts of Cambridge, Massachusetts,
the incident of the professors was preluded by the expulsion
from the Harvard Divinity School of the student, Frederick
Willis. In the fall of 1855, Mr. Willis had manifested
mediumistic faculty. His presence favored many of the
more difficult physico-psychic phenomena, especially the in
dependent playing on musical instruments. He submitted
to very exacting and painful tests. Professor Eustis was
present on one occasion, and declared the whole proceeding
fraudulent, but never condescended to go into details. Willis
continued to give seances.
The Divinity Faculty declined to discuss his case, but
thought to teach a good Christian lesson by summarily ex
pelling Mr. Willis. Indeed, it is hard to believe that a
person whose vitality was mortgaged to physical manifesta
tions could be a very sedulous and successful searcher in

biblical exegesis. Perhaps, in these more matter of fact
later days, should the Harvard Divinity School by chance
corral a youth of the kidney of Mr. Willis, they would count
themselves in luck and cling to him as a rare specimen in
the fauna of psychic research. But the ghostly worm had
not yet turned to show its belly labeled, "psychic research."
Willis was defended before the faculty of the Divinity School
by Rev. T. F. Harrington, and in the columns of the Boston
Traveller, by Col. Thomas Wentworth Higginson (1823-
191 1). The men of action were at the breach. The defense
was sworn to at Worcester, Massachusetts, April 15, 1857.
The men of 1857 took their law seriously.
Thereupon the Boston Courier offered a reward or prize
of five hundred dollars if the spiritualists could make out
a case of supernormal manifestation. As such offers have
been and are being made, thus testifying to the continued
activity of the metapsychic influence, a word as to their
helpfulness towards the truth were not amiss. Discoveries,
standards, working formulae have not often been attained
by previous offer of rewards or prizes. The protective sys
tem, in its large and Benthamian sense, has done little or
nothing to advance civilization. It is the pure action of
the scientific mind, stimulated by phenomena of nature or
of society, which secures progress. Perhaps this argument
favors bolshevism. The truth does no harm. Bolshevism
can be counted on as the most determined enemy of the
psychic, in all its forms, as yet encountered.
The most obvious objection to the utility of prizes and
competitions is that the subject to be treated or contended
about must be formulated in advance. It cannot be treated
as provisional. It must be seriously and literally accepted
or rejected. It is "either, or." The trial is to be a legal
one in which no opportunity is admitted to amend the
pleadings. But in the course of scientific research the plead
ings always are amended. The results are never what it was

set out to find. Columbus did not reach the coast of Asia,
for America lay between; and it is doubtful if he ever ap
preciated what he really had found. And so of explorations
into molecular nature. It is not predictable what will be
the resultant of a combination of two reagents not hitherto
brought into a chemical relation. Prizes will remain ad cap-
tanduns with the commonalty.
The offerers of prizes on a wager of the kind envisaged
by the Courier are all the safer in their risk of loss, that the
opposed party is also wedded to an interpretation that will
not stand an exact definition, even after much familiarity.
The writer of this book is endeavoring to narrow the con
fines of his own ignorance on the metapsychic phenomena.
He believes, indeed, that the communications speak loudly
of personalities, but he is much at sea as to what a per
sonality really is. His state of mind might, therefore, con
ceivably even be stretched to cover a formula which denied
the fact of the communications, on the ground that they
do not emanate from a source corresponding to a precon
ceived status of personality.
It is highly improbable, no matter how valuable the tests
obtained, that the referees in such a contest would ever de
cide to award the sum offered. They would say to them
selves: "But suppose it should turn out that we were de
ceived, after all !" So the Courier made its perfectly safe offer
of five hundred dollars to the spiritualist society if the ref
erees should decide that the "raps" were genuine. The chal
lenge assumes the possibility of a final, definitive statement of
truth. The challengers themselves are probably so naive as
to think a final formula within the bounds of possibility.
Perhaps they never reflected that their whole mental life is
one of working assumptions, I may say, of compromises.
Pragmatism destroys dogmatism. A prize offered to prove a
principle is conclusive of but one thing: the naivete of the
offerer. Perhaps, in the long run, by a subconscious logic, or

innate sense of fairness, the public senses the hollowness
of the whole proceeding.
If the offeree were not equally naive, the challenge would
not be accepted. The spiritualists, however, at least took
the precaution of stipulating that the members of the com
mittee were to remain in the circle and that the spiritualists,
through Dr. Gardner, were to exercise "the determination
of all the accessory circumstances." The committee con
sisted of Professors Benjamin Peirce (1809-1880), Louis
Agassiz (1807-1873), and E. N. Horsford (1818-1893), with
whom were associated Dr. N. B. Gould of the Albany Ob
servatory, and an editor of the Courier. The Spiritualists
invited Alvin Adams, of Adams Express Company, Rev.
Allen Putnam, and Major Rains of Newburgh, New York,
and also, "an editor of the Boston Traveller," and Dr. Bell,
lately superintendent of the MacLean Lunatic Asylum. The
mediums engaged were Mrs. Brown (Leah Fox), her sister,
Catherine Fox, Mr. J. C. Mansfield, Mrs. Kendrick, Mr.
George Redman, and the Davenport brothers. The seances
were held at the Albion Buildings, Tremont Street, and oc
cupied a portion of three successive days, June 25, 26, 27,
1857.
The manifestations were practically nil. The scientific
committee took the occasion to read a moral lesson, which,
indeed, may have been wholesome for the gaping-mouthed
element of the spiritualist faith, not yet ten years in the run
ning: "It is the opinion of the committee, derived from
observation, that any connection with spiritualistic circles,
so-called, corrupts the morals and degrades the intellect.
They therefore deem it their solemn duty to warn the com
munity against this contaminating influence, which surely
tends to lessen the truth of man and the purity of woman.

The promised final report was never made. The above
names are those of the foremost men of science of their time.
And yet it would be absurd to call their report a scientific
report. They felt that some expression should be given to
their consciousness of departure from the scientific role; but
they never fulfilled their promise of
it,
and for the most
obvious reason.
Leah, the real fighting editor of the Fox, associated,
heavenly press, perceived the weakness of their position and
attacked them in the following fashion:
"When the annals of science can produce recorded proofs
that new discoveries generally result from the associative
action of schools, colleges, and lyceums ... we may find
a
fair excuse for the abject and unreasoning submission with
which the great mass of mankind bow down before the dicta
of scientific bodies. . . Nor had the sting worn off
some thirty years later:
"But
I
am quite sure, from the experience
I
have had, that
a
great majority of those highly conceited professors, many
of whom were of quite ordinary talent, had, to some extent
overcome the deficiencies of nature by turning their attention
in one direction of specific study only.
"On all other subjects they are ordinary, often very ordi
nary, men.""

priests of the temple of Knowledge. She was out for

vival, not exactly among the broad masses, but among those
acute business heads who had been estranged by the solecisms
current in the vulgar theology and were on the watch for a
religion that would appeal to their argumentum-ad-hommem
view of the General Plan. More or less of spiritualism has
ever since hung on the hems of this very respectable level of
burghers, although they have been parceled among Unita
rians, Campbellites, Christian Science, New Thought, The-
osophy, and still other innovating, theological color-tones
and points of view.
It was not to be expected that Leah should dwell on the
dangers of premature or over-rapid propaganda. The re
vivalist is anything but a philosopher or even a lawyer, whose
first duty is carefully to con the case of his adversary. How
ever, it appears that the referees did not abide by the rules
of the adopted code. The last echoes of the challenge and
investigation died out in reciprocal recriminations. Among
other charges made by the spiritualists was that of the Rev.
Allen Putnam that the committee interfered with the phe
nomena "by ejecting certain forces from their own minds
and eyes."
The seat of thought was anciently located in the stomach.
Equally naive, the spiritualists of the fifties had, apparently,
a theory that manifestations can be inhibited by unfriendly
glances. Be that as it may, there seems to be ample ground
for belief that manifestations are much more difficult in the
presence of persons violently prejudiced against them. The
telepathic machinery awaits exact ascertainment, but the
peculiar properties of rigidity and elasticity and yet of im-
ponderableness and permeability attributed to ether, open
the way to discovery of media of fantastic virtues, which
put themselves at the service of the will in transmiting mes
sages of sympathy or of dislike, of encouragement or of the
opposite. If Michaelson and Morley have discountenanced
the ether, then call it something else. Lodge stands by it.

Modern theories of physics were hardly yet in the making,
but an impetus to them was given by the other worldly at
mosphere spread by the spiritualist movement. In 1900,
Professor N. S. Shaler could write : "We know of this ether
or infinite space-filler of the visible universe little more than
that it seems to be in a way, material as it in certain ways
transmits impulses, and in a way not material in any sense
of matter known to us, in that it in no measurable way
resists the movement of the heavenly bodies." 14
The attitude of Agassiz almost seemed to justify Leah's
reprobation. He acknowledged to her privately: "Mrs.
Brown, I have seen the day I could do everything you do."
Again : "My physical condition is much changed now." "
He had been a mesmeric subject of Rev. Chauncey Hare
Townshend, in 1839, at Neuchatel. This clairvoyant fac
ulty of Agassiz was no idle boast, for the manner of his
scientific discoveries was in line with it,
if
we are to credit
the tradition of the sketch of the fossil fish on the unopened
box containing it. Why, then, should he set himself to
frustrating manifestations at the Courier tournament?
Doubtless he shared the Church's conviction that the truth
was not to be prematurely vulgarized, â€”not without scien
tific editing. But was there not added
a
dash of that psycho
pathic weakness of his own mediumship of which further
mention will be made in discussing the "recantation" of
Katie?
In view of the present stage of speculation in matters
metapsychic, Agassiz' astonishing insight in taxonomy
is
to
be credited to his higher nature, to his mind, rather than
to his brain. Outside of this insight, he appears to have
been ultraconservative,
if
we may judge from his attitude
at the Courier prize contest and from his position on the
subject of Darwinism, for he held out for the theory of

separate creations of new species, which, be it added, seems
to be obtaining a new vogue. Many inconsistencies in human
conduct point to a dual constitution, adapted to two worlds.
The plain citizen who does not scrutinize popular tenden
cies, accepts or rejects as the humor strikes him, but the
academic man, committed to caution, is aroused to anger
by phenomena which he cannot classify. The first avenue of
escape from an unwelcome mental intrusion is to deny the
objective existence of the occurrences. And so, writes Leah,
Professor C. C. Felton of Harvard "burned with angry zeal
against spiritualism." 18
Felton, just made president of
Harvard, published a letter on this subject, in April, 1860,
to which Robert Dale Owen, just back from Europe, replied
on November 12th, substantially agreeing that some evidence
convincing to the common mind is necessary for the meta-
psychic phenomena: "Even if the phenomena, wisely fol
lowed up, may elevate morality and fortify religion, yet if
these marvels are permitted to spread among us without
chart or compass whereby to steer our course through an
unexplored ocean of mystery, we may find ourselves at the
mercy of very sinister influences." 17
The Underhills (Leah was Mrs. Underhill) invited Presi
dent Felton to spend a fortnight at their house, 232 West
Thirty-seventh Street, but he declined.18 They had hoped
to convince him of the veridicity of the phenomena.
At a much later date, Professor Nathaniel Southgate
Shaler of Harvard, in his admirable book on "The Individ
ual," speaks of the degrading associations of the spiritualistic
seance. He seems to have inherited the early prejudice that
the joining of hands in the dark was a temptation towards
unspiritual impulses." The practice was probably an in
heritance from the battery theory of Mesmer. The French

National Astronomer, Camille Flammarion, gayly concedes
that marriages have resulted from acquaintanceship at
seances. As in dancing, demoralization depends on motives.
/Anyhow, experience has shown that, in most cases, the join
ing of hands is of no advantage to the odic force, except
that joining which is the holding of the hands and feet of
the medium by way of certifying and policing the manifes
tations when they are in the dark or do not exact that she
use her hands, as in automatic writing in the light.
Control of the medium is important in case anything hap
pens interesting to record. In the same way, the speed of a
horse does not constitute a record unless ascertained at a
standardized trial. Again, the altitude record of an airplane
is accepted only if the barometer had been officially sealed.
In the case, for instance, of autograph writing in the dark,
it is important that the medium's hands be held, although
the writing often takes place far out of her reach. Even
then the holding makes surer that she does not leave her
\ place. Further on in his book, however, Professor Shaler
expresses a real interest in metapsychic phenomena and even
entertains the possibility of their veridicity. Our leading
university put the conservative brakes on the movement so
long as it could, and while it was undoubtedly bound thus
to hold back, it is to be regretted that the duty was not
performed more suaviter modo and that its distinguished
professors lent their names to an ex cathedra pronounce
ment.
The final position of Shaler certainly evidences structural
work on the bridge leading from conservatism, assumed for
the public good, to enthusiasm for psychic research and for
its acceptance into the family of sciences. It is contained
in the following extracts: "But no well-trained observer who
has carefully remembered his experiences with phenomena
is likely to affirm that he finds in those of death anything
that can fitly be termed proof that the mind does not sur

. . . "We have the evidence from the transmission
of the potential qualities of man over the frail molecular
bridge of the egg that the spirit may safely be given into
the keeping of other forms of matter than the brain affords.
This raises the presumption that matter in certain forms far
simpler than the nervous system can contain the germs of an
individualized intelligence.21 Next we have the series of facts
going to show that the presumption is altogether in favour
of an intelligence of some kind, presumably akin to our
own, which abides in or dominates over phenomena." 22
. . . "the scientific student should be ready to acknowl
edge the value of a belief in a hereafter as an asset in human
life. In the presence of so many mysteries which have been
unveiled, in the presence of so many yet unsolved, he can
not be dogmatic and deny the possibility of a future
state."2" . . .
The high water mark of Katie's powers as a medium for
materializations was undoubtedly the unparalleled series of
hundreds of seances held for Mr. C. F. Livermore, in New
York City, 1861-1866. Spirit portraits and automatic writ
ing on an equally grand scale occupied her, at periods some
times widely separated, with the G. H. Taylor circle in
the same city, 1869-1892, as hereinafter related. It is fortu
nate that the records of both of these successive groups of
metapsychic experiences were kept with scrupulous care.
The former will be found summarized by Mr. Owen,2* while
the latter is more extensively, but still most inadequately,
analyzed in the following pages.28 Since some of the Liver-

sumed that Katie lived with her parents till their death in
1865,29 so that but three years intervened till she came to
live with the Taylors. In that interval, she enjoyed, as ever
after, the comfort and advice of Leah, the brains of the
mediumistic family.
In 1861, Mr. Livermore lost his first wife, as the present
writer understands, whom Mr. Owen presents under the
name of "Estelle." Dr. John F. Gray, already mentioned
as one of the early, open-minded New Yorkers on the sub
ject of spirit communication, having always been her
physician, suggested to Mr. Livermore the possibility of re
pairing the personal bond broken by death. After the usual
evolution of phenomena, recapitulating creation (another and
analogous generation), "at last, on the twenty-fourth sitting,

Three days afterward, there came this message: 'I know
that I can make myself visible to you. Meet tomorrow
night. Secure the doors and windows, for I wish the test
to be beyond all doubt, for your good and the good of
others.'
"
Even the brief account of the Livermore mate
rializations given by Mr. Owen must be here further
abridged.
It would be well to quote a note of Mr. Owen's with regard
to the medium: "I here remark that all communications
obtained through Kate Fox were eitherâ€”Spelled out, letter
after letter, by the raps; Or else written, sometimes by Kate's
right hand, sometimes by the left; but the writing always
executed inversely; so that it could only be read by holding
it against a mirror. Occasionally she writes two communi
cations at once; both hands moving at the same time, each
on a separate sheet. And I have myself witnessed the fol
lowing: while her hand was writing, there was, by raps, a
call for the alphabet; whereupon Kate called over the letters

and took down the message, letter by letter, without for a
moment discontinuing her writing. Mr. L. has often wit
nessed all the above phases of communication."
"In addition to this, the internal evidence of many of the
messages
is,
especially to those who know Miss Fox well, con
clusive evidence that these originate entirely outside of her
will and of her intelligence." 28
After
a
number of sittings of increasing interest, No. 43,
April 18, 1861, occurred, which Owen copies verbatim from
the Livermore record, and which follows:
"Wind south-west. Weather fair. Having absolutely se
cured doors and windows, we sat
in
perfect quiet for half an
hour, my faith becoming weak. Then we were startled by
a
tremendous rap on the heavy mahogany centre-table which,
at the same time, rose and fell. The door was violently
shaken, the windows opened and shut: in fact, everything
movable in the room seemed in motion. Questions were an
swered by loud knocks on the doors, on the glass of the win
dows, on the ceilingâ€”everywhere.
"Then an illuminated substance like gauze rose from the
floor behind us, moved about the room and finally came in
front of us. Vigorous electrical sounds were heard. The
gauze-like substance assumed the form of

the upper part was revealed;

by
a
succession of quick raps from all parts of the room, as
though an unseen audience expressed its applause.
"The figure reappeared several times, the recognition be
coming each time more nearly perfect. Afterward, the head

a
point about midway
between us and the wall; the electrical cracklings increased;
the wall was illuminated and brought out an entire female
figure facing that side of the room, the light apparently in one
of her hands. The form remained in sight fully half an hour
and each movement was distinctly visible. Then came the
message:
"
'Now see me rise.'
"And immediately, in full brightness, the figure rose to the
ceiling, remained there
a

who was allowed to play with the hair, which, at first per
fectly normal, soon melted away in his fingers.
It is worth remarking in connection with Mr. Livermore's
"glimpse of heaven," that it does, indeed, repeat the experi
ence of the mystics, who seek for immediate revelation of
truth, â€”a craving which Professor James considers basic in
religion, but that it also goes further. We are not to be put
aside by the cant psychology that all was imagination. If the
rest of the sitting was not imaginary, so was not this glimpse
of heaven. And if Estelle occupied space, so was the view in
question a view into space. But what space? Hereon
perhaps the dimensional speculators would hang a tale. How
ever, the sittings briefly indicated were followed by three
hundred more. The cult continued for years. Finally, Mr.
Livermore remarried, the burden of continuous performance
of these rites and of faithful watching of the vestal flame
passed over, after an interval, to the Taylor family, until
Katie went abroad and tended with her cruet the lamps of
strange penates.
The mention of the Livermore sittings, however, cannot be
cut short by neglecting the apparition of the archpsycho-
revivalist, Benjamin Franklin. This is the account of one of
the sittings:
"The raps requested that a chair be placed for Dr. Frank
lin on the side of the table opposite to where we sat. But the
idea of such a vis-a-vis made Miss Fox so nervous that I did
not insist. After a time she became quiet, and we heard the
chair moved to the desired spot.
"At this time the lights were dim ; but I perceived a dark
figure standing near me. Very soon it moved round the table,
a rustling was heard, the light brightened, and we saw what
seemed the old philosopher himself seated in the chair; his
the spirituality of his face, the nobility of his bearing so far transcended
those of recollection that I believed they represented his new estate and I
still so believe. The conviction and memory are ever vivid.

entire form and dress in perfection. So vivid was the light,
and so palpable (as it would seem) the form before us, that
its shadow was thrown upon the wall, precisely as if it had
been a mortal seated there. The position was easy and dig
nified, one arm and hand on the table. Once he bent forward,
as if bowing to us, and I observed that his gray locks swayed
with the movement. He sat opposite to us more than an
hour. Finally I asked him if he would draw nearer; where
upon figure and chair moved toward us, and our silent neigh
bor was in close proximity. Before he disappeared he rose
from his chair, both face and form distinctly visible."
No. 175. Franklin showed himself by striking matches.
"The third time my hat was on his head, worn as by a living
person; and then it was removed from his head to mine."
(The doors had been "locked and sealed.") The last time he
appeared, the figure of Estelle showed itself, leaning on his
shoulder: but Miss Fox became nervous and her exclamations
(apparently) caused the final disappearance of both figures.
Then there came the following:
"This is what we have long labored to accomplish. You
can now say that you have seen me by the light of earth. I
will come again, in further proof."
"B. F."
No. 179. A lantern had been provided. . . . "Then the
lantern again rose, remaining suspended about five feet from
the floor, between the bureau and the mirror; and, by its
light, we discerned the figure of Franklin seated in my arm
chair by the window, in front of a dark curtain. For fully
ten minutes at a time, the light from the suspended lantern
rested on his face and figure, so that we had ample time to
examine both. At first the face seemed as if of actual flesh,
the hair real, the eyes bright and so distinct that I clearly
saw the whites. But I noticed that gradually the whole ap
pearance, including the eyes, was deadened by the earthly
light (of the lantern) and ceased to wear the aspect of life

to allow more or less light; and this I did while the lantern
remained suspended, or held by invisible power.

"B. F."
The ghost in Hamlet was exceptional. As a rule ghosts do
not speak, but communicate by the accepted seance methods.
The investigations recently published by Mme. Juliette
Alexandre-Bisson demonstrate that the ghost is a sort of auto
plastic figure, an artist's manikin, created by the will of
entities who dispose of exceptional materials, extremely sen
sitive to the will. Biological history stands to prove that
evolution more and more puts the environment at the dis
position of the will. It is but natural, therefore, that this
molding of the environment should, in the fourth dimension,
have reached the stage of forming one's own exterior, at least
for the purpose of exhibition in the third dimension. The
Bisson seances are in course of retrial, new proving, and con
firming, in many places and countries.
The pervasiveness and gradual unfolding and increasing
domination of the auto-plastic principle form an important
chapter in metapsychic theory. The lower animals and espe
cially the prehistoric animals seem to enjoy little power over
their surroundings. The best they can do is to seek the places
of the earth most favorable to their personal well-being; and
they themselves have sprung into life equipped with reference
to the media in which they find themselves, â€”land, air, water,
â€”plant life included.

graph, kinetograph, and the like. The last item creates an
almost perfect illusion of reality (and what more could we
ask?) But, after all, the way in which man has always
sought to produce a favorable climate by the enclosing of a
section of the atmosphere in a box called a house, which pro
tects from wind and rain, and in which he is able to generate
an artificial, enveloping warmth, is the most remarkable part
of the will and wish development alluded to.
However, the evolution of the human will may be carried
beyond shelter and dress to the features of the human face.
The animals wear a mask which admits of expression almost
exclusively through the eye and the flexible edges of the nose
and mouth. But the face of man is far more expressive;
the restricted flexibility in the animal mask spreads over the
whole face of man, even the forehead can be wrinkled and the
eyebrows contracted or expanded, and the nose pinched and
serrated, while the smile irradiates the whole countenance.
That "God grants our desires" is even banal.
In another connection, when speaking of the use of tools
by man, I remarked that the only way animals have of
creating a tool is to grow one, attached to the body, and that
through endless ages of effort; but that man has abandoned
this dilatory process of corporeal engineering, and cuts out
"false maneuvers" by frankly building the machine sepa
rately and apart. This idea of the detached arm or tentacle
starts with raw materials and persists up to finished product,
be it the house warmed with steam or with hot water or hot
air, or the needle, the watch, the compass, the opera glass.
But it occurs to one that man has not wholly abandoned
a personal, physiological, autoplasticity. Just as the brain
has refined with the growth of ideas, and as we must sup
pose a soul, a higher, responsible, etherealized body in and
about the visible body, to handle this marvelously multi
plied universe of thought and feeling within man, so has
he cultivated not only speech (the organs of speech were

prepared, according to some authorities, before they were
put to use), but has supplemented his powers of communi
cation with facial modulation, gestures, postures, and danc
ing. Animals do all of these things, but in a very primitive
and imperfect way. The point here to retain is that man
does these things by special cultivation and application of
the original, tool-growing, animal function, having aban
doned all further, organic, tool-growing attempts.
The fourth dimension we agree to be a locality where the
general concepts, as we view them, become very matter of
fact, routine, and thus concrete or, as we often say, particu
lar and special. It is to be expected that the will should,
under such conditions, enjoy a broader play. What we on
earth understand as capitalism, or the application of tools
organized for long-time completion of goods, is the only
method we have of affecting our living conditions, in a large,
effective, quasi-permanent way. The fourth dimension offers
less obstruction to free play of the will. The detached, ex
tension, tool method will there be radically restricted or
defined, for capitalistic methods will hardly come so much
into play. The permanence in the idea of capitalism will
transfer itself to consumption and consumption goods, which
will be created very largely at will. Man's capitalism will
be centered in soul-building.
The so-called materializations are not the souls, them
selves, but a sort of mask or covering or armor which the
souls assume in order to become visible. They would seem,
on general principles and also on authority of the Cleveland
script signed "Franklin," and on others, to be composed of
materials partly proper to the fourth, partly to the third
dimensionsâ€”an alloy, as it were, which retains much of the
unobstructed obedience to the will which belongs to the
fourth dimensional "matter." But the communications, at
a seance of materialization, continue by means of the raps
or echoes which, perhaps, can be as well exploded when

the soul is in one place as when in another, inside its diving-
bell as outside of it.
A spiritual light lends to these appearances much of their
reality, and atones for imperfections in the sculpture. It is
the whole of the causes or processes which together consti
tute the reality which we think we perceive wholly out
wardly. This principle, that we cannot know or at least
perceive the thing by itself, is as old in statement as Kant,
who also held that we cannot know anything at all in the
absence of a Ding an sich. Doubtless it is a duplicity of
effects which spirits lay hold of as a means of hallucina
tion: they may offer a Ding an sich, relatively speaking;
but simultaneously they are able favorably to affect our
inner perceptions, so that the combination of the outer and
the inner is the reality as near as any reality we can know.
Evidently, the formation of a complete duplicate of the
spirit for purpose of exhibition in the third dimension is
quite difficult. And yet talking ghosts are not outside of
experience. So that the ghost in Hamlet is no error in
Shakespeare. Only, by and large, we may venture to affirm
that parsimony of speaking itself speaks for the genuineness
of the genus ghost. Their silence is persuasive of their
sincerity.
Returning at length to our narrative from the excursion
into which "B. F." has led us, we should add that Dr. Gray
was present at ten of the Livermore sittings for materiali
zation, and Mr. Groute, Mr. L's brother-in-law, at eight.
"During the fourth sitting there was a message to the effect
that a piece of the spirit's garment might be cut off with
scissors and examined. Both Dr. Gray and Mr. Livermore
availed themselves of this permission. For a time, the tex
ture was strong, so that it might be pulled without coming
apart. They had both time to examine it critically before
it melted away." 81

CHAPTER V
SCIENCE VS. YELLOW JOURNALISM
The words of Owen about Katie, quoted at the end of the
last chapter, characterize her exactly as he and I knew her.
I never heard her utter a cross word or an expression of
recrimination or of personal criticism, much less of scandal.
The hasty, ill-advised persons who have attributed to her
deep schemes and deft, cunning tricks were speaking from
*
their prejudices, not from observation. Her weakness for
liquor she never completely shook off, but she bravely mas
tered it for some very considerable periods. I cannot give
a date for the first appearance of the craving; but it was
believed by my mother to be attributable to wealthy sitters
at private seances who themselves were accustomed to
spirituous liquors, and who pressed them upon Katie. The
appetite was the price she paid for the privilege, as it was
the duty, of perpetual mediumship. Released to normal
life, she would no longer have needed alcohol. It was re
lated that her parents were separated for some ten years,
on account of the inebriety of Mr. J. D. Fox, the father.
He reformed, the parents were reunited, and Maggie and
Katie were born. The older children, the children of his
weakness, turned out sober, but the children of his better
days turned outâ€”mediums.
It is to the delicate, nervous organism of the younger
daughters that we must attribute a craving for stimulants,
which the older brother and sisters, more normal, better
buffered with muscles, and less encumbered with a high-
powered, wireless outfit, could repress with small effort or
gratify with moderation. I remember Mrs. Underhill as a
stout, comfortable, well-favored lady. Maggie and Katie

were slighter. Katie's weight I should estimate at perhaps
one hundred and twenty pounds, a sympathetic little person,
without education, excepting what she imbibed from the ex
cellent company with whom she was usually thrown, and
with a mind wholly devoid of curiosity for learning. I fancy
that her chief schooling was received at the country and
city public schools of Arcadia, and Rochester, before she
was nine years old. The benevolent design of Greeley to
fill the void in her intellectual equipment and to make of
her a second Margaret Fuller did not carry very far. As a
large part of her career was occupied in spelling out the

vocabulary of that sort of telegraph is neither large nor
varied. Katie was a perfectly normal medium. But the part
costs.
When for a time under the influence of drink (there were
reform periods when she was quite trustworthy in this mat

degrading associations of the seance," on which those dwelt
whose trust in human nature had traveled so far as the
Declaration of Independence but stopped short at sorcery,
witchcraft, mysticism, and mesmerism, were unknown to me
and never in word or act implicated in the presence or
personality of this trim, little figure. Undoubtedly she was
a typical seeress; her dreamy eyes and a certain languor
of enunciation and of gesture and carriage were in keeping
with the part. She was, however, most keenly interested
in the phenomena which everywhere accompanied her, giv
ing to her advice in the privacy of her chamber, as well as
counsel and revelation to others, in the seance. I have

ducing the manner and looks of Katie; but she never de

scended to their simulation, tricks, and duplicity, their
invidious mimicry.
Most instructive is the fact that she was often the most
surprised and even frightened of all persons in attendance
at physical phenomena and materializations, at their noise,
their vividness, at the uncertainty and uncanniness of things
that are done in the dark. No one, indeed, could be more
broken into the metapsychic occurrences than she was. At
nine years of age, she had snapped her fingers, curious whether
the peddler's ghost would reply, and was childishly de
lighted at a response that would have terribly frightened
other children. In the jargon of the spiritualists, she was
thoroughly and permanently "magnetized." But her career
as a medium was not on an uninterrupted level of wont and
use. On the contrary, the period was one in which the
apparent and the invisible worlds were testing out their
common ground with thoroughness, and Katie was herself a
pretty large lot in the surveyed plat.
The fact that her form had crossed the ocean in nowise
affected her self-consciousness or simple, modest, I almost
said, "lowly" bearing. The project of a trip to England,
however, was most natural, both on account of the demand
there for the presence of the great, American medium, and
because Katie had earned a change of scene; rest, in the
sense of cessation of phenomena, was not to be hers. There
have been many temporary or occasional mediums. Katie
was perpetual. Her very dreams were swaddled in raps.
And so, on October 7, 1871, Katie took ship for Europe.
The circumstances of the departure are described by my
mother in a citation included in a subsequent chapter. The
details of her residence in England, at 53 Brompton Crescent,
Brompton,1 where, as the wife of Mr. H. D. Jencken, Bar
rister at law, Katie was largely occupied by domestic cares,
need not concern us. The hypothesis lies at hand that,

perchance, Mr. Jencken had courted the possibility that his
children might prove greater mediums than their mother.
The desire for superior progeny is universal; to it is to be
attributed the improvements in domestic animals and plants;
why not in homo sapiens ?
The older of Mrs. Jencken's two sons was Ferdinand
Diedrich Loewenstein Jencken, born September 19, 1873. On
the 18th of February, 1874, at H. D. Jencken's rooms at
Brighton, England, a pencil being put into Ferdie's hands,
he wrote in the Greek language and characters:
5m els f/te mareiet Jwcret.
"He who trusts in Me shall live." *
And on the 11th of March following, he similarly was able
to write the message, "I love this little boy. God bless his
mamma. J. D. F. I am happy." Hence, when he finally
came to America with his mother, in August, 1888, he was
fifteen years old. I never learned that he ever used intoxi
cants. When his mother died in 1892, he was employed as a
traveling news agent on the Delaware and Lackawanna. One
day, when on his run out of New York, he obeyed an im
pulse to return to his mother by leaving his outgoing train
and boarding an incoming one at a station. It was her
last illness. I remember him as an erect, intelligent youth.
He adopted the profession of a medium, but died at the early
age of 35. The obituary in the press dispatch reads: "New
York, April 22 (1908)â€”Fifty members of the First Spirit
ualist society of New York gathered last evening to attend
the funeral services of Ferdinand Fox Jencken, who died
Sunday.
"Mr. Jencken, who was 38 years old, died of consumption.
(Error in age?) He was the last surviving member of the
Fox family, who founded spiritualism in Rochester about
sixty years ago.

102 KATIE FOX
"Mr. Jencken was the son of Kate Fox, a famous medium
in her day. When his mother was a little girl living at
Rochester, uncanny rappings were heard about the Fox
house, which attracted the attention of the entire country.
Kate, then a child, said that she was able to get answers
from spirits, and became medium and clairvoyant. Her sis
ters, Leah and Margaret, followed her example, but she was
the most successful of the three." Ferdie had abbreviated
his name to suit the American practice in the matter of
names.
Not only does the press dispatch testify that the virtuosity
of Katie has passed into legend, but it further, by its vague
perfunctoriness, suggests the idea of the need for further
metapsychic revival.
A second son, Henry, was born at Mrs. Underbill's in
New York, in 1875. He was more delicate than Ferdinand.
My impression is that he died before his mother.
It was well that Katie went to England, for she there not
only founded a family of her own but she offered the op
portunity to Sir William Crookes to investigate spiritualism.
It was no chance that the two greatest mediums, D. D. Home
and Katie Fox, were brought into contact with the greatest
living physicist.*
"Like a traveler exploring some distant country, the won
ders of which have hitherto been known only through re
ports and rumours of a vague or distorted character, so for
four years have I been occupied in pushing an enquiry into
a territory of natural knowledge which offers almost virgin
soil to a scientific man." *
. . . Mr. Crookes writes of being
compelled to suspend investigations because D. D. Home
is not in good health and "Miss Kate Fox (now Mrs.
Jencken) is not free from domestic and maternal occupa-

services of a good medium: "Spiritualism, among its more
devout followers, is a religion. The mediums, in many
cases young members of the family, are guarded with a se
clusion and a jealousy which an outsider can penetrate with
difficulty."

every medium, each having a special peculiarity; they are
more varied with Mr. Home, but for power and certainty
I have met with no one who at all approached Miss Kate
Fox. For several months I enjoyed almost unlimited op
portunity of testing the various phenomena occurring in the
presence of this lady, and I especially examined the phe
nomena of these sounds. With mediums generally it is nec
essary to sit for a formal seance before anything is heard;
but in the case of Miss Fox, it seems only necessary for her
to place her hand on any substance for loud thuds to be

to be heard several rooms off. ...

value must satisfy all the conditions of the problem. It is
not enough for a person, who has perhaps seen only a few
of the inferior phenomena, to say 'I suspect it was all cheat
ing,' or 'I saw how some of the tricks could be done.'
" "
The belief reached by Crookes, after four years of study
of metapsychic phenomena, did not grow dim with time.
Indeed, the scientific mind never loses and seldom relaxes
its grasp on a problem once visualized. The work-a-day
man has a weak hold on fundamental truth, which is ban
ished by the humdrum of wont and use. He is unable to
objectify his thoughts sufficiently to construct an extended
argument, or to hold firmly a theoretical point of view, or
to distinguish between hypothesis and experience so as to
reach a valid conclusion. Being unable to visualize ideas
as such, except those of a rudimentary or merely, one might
say, pugnacious sort, he is unable to draw those fine distinc
tions which, the more we entertain them, grow until they
acquire a solid importance. Instance the difficulty of ab
stracting the "positive" from the "material" in thought.
And so of most abstract adjectives.
But a Crookes kept with him the problem of immortality
some thirty years longer, and then, as President of the
British Association for the Promotion of Science, than which
no more weighty an organization of men of science is to be
found, he was able to and took occasion firmly to declare,
in his inaugural speech, that he in no whit relaxed his belief
in the veridicity of the metapsychic phenomena and that
he held by his conclusions of 1874.
Of course many eminent men of science, besides the "Har
vard Professors," have fulminated against spiritualism. In
stance Faraday and Haeckel. But few after investigation.
Scientific men like to cast off the restraints of science, once
in a while. It rests their brains to relapse frankly into the
field of prejudice. Psychic research, however, has pretty

well corraled them. They generally admit that something
new has been found for investigation. What further could
one ask? To demand that they arrive at your or my con
clusion were but an avowal of your or my own prejudices.
All human conclusions partake of the temporal and pro
visional. And yet it is possible, consistently with this ad
mission, to take a positive attitude. Let us avow that there
is such a thing as personality, and that the metapsychic
phenomena are, at least, documents in the case, and we shall
have advanced far enough to suit the requirements of prog
ress as well as of a most human, social, and ethical imagina
tion.
The narrative now reaches a trivial episode which would
better be omitted were it not that it has exerted so un
favorable an impression about Katie Fox, in high quarters.
It is the "nigger in the woodpile" who must be unmasked if
the Fox sisters are to rest in the odor of sanctity which is
their due. It is the fashion for biographers to present the
rosy view of the lives they profess truthfully to record; and
it is certainly their duty to say all the good they can. A
bad life would not be worth recording, except, perhaps, briefly
and quite objectively, as a study in the social sciences. But
when so good, sweet, and innocent a seeress as was our
Katie is accused of fraud and claimed to have condemned
herself, on her own admission, it is the duty of her friends
to register a protest in no uncertain tones.
Professor J. H. Hyslop, Secretary of the American Society
for Psychical Research, in his book, "Contact with the Other
World," p. 28, wrote as follows:
"It was the confession of Margaret Fox that deprived the
movement of both its scientific and religious interest. She
confessed to making raps with her toe joints. It mattered
not that there were other and mental phenomena which were
well attested, and that there was testimony that raps had
occurred in localities where action of the toe joints could not

be effective. The confession of fraud sufficed to rob the case
forever of scientific interest. . . .
"The spiritualists who endeavored to defend their proteges
only weakened their cause and brought it into deserved con
tempt. There can be no doubt in the mind of the present
writer that the phenomena of the Fox sisters never received
their deserved recognition, but" . . . etc., etc.
There is here an unconscious attempt by the Secretary of
the Society for Psychical Research to insist upon a rigid, an
tagonistic aggressiveness at the same time that he cannot
repress his convictions as a spiritualist. It is a throwing of a
sop to the scientific Cerberus, and the sop is the poor "Fox
sisters." He does not mention by name a third sister, Leah,
Mrs. Underhill, but she is of course included in the dragnet.
There are three, legal assumptions in the indictment: (1)
all scientific interest about all phenomena of a medium ceases
with the discovery of fraud in any case. Are we to believe
this version of the author's dogma, or the contradictory one
to be found, p. 58, of the same volume? "Honesty has no
importance in determining the nature of the phenomena.
Only tests to exclude normal knowledge and sensation can
decide whether the facts are .super-normal or not. For this
reason the scientist does not care whether he is dealing with
frauds or not, if only he can determine the conditions under
which the phenomena are produced."
Why then did not Professor Hyslop accord to the "Fox sis
ters" at least the concession of a fair trial under severe tests,
which he permitted to other mediums? The only explana
tion I can imagine is that an atmosphere inimical to all the
Fox family had spread over the headquarters of the S.P.R.,
which the distinguished Secretary was unable to pierce or
clear away, with the result of the foregoing inconsistency.
The cause of this unfavorable atmosphere we shall proceed
to consider, directly.

not on a par with that of an average or normal person, but is
to be judged by far stricter standards.
(3) Those who insist that the case of Maggie (not to speak
of Katie, who only verbally assented to Maggie's "confes
sion") should not be given the privilege of thorough dis
cussion are injuring the cause of psychic research more than
the Secretary who goes out of his way to throw stones at the
humble mediums who have furnished more material for scien
tific investigation than any others and whose early manifes
tations were, it is little exaggeration to say, the very basis of
the whole metapsychic revival in the world, and the chief
raison d'etre for the societies for psychic research.
For the writer, reared in the gentle atmosphere of a pure
family cult (and civilized religion is the offspring of ancestor-
worship), this attack on the revered seeress of his youth
comes as nothing less than monstrous. It is time to speak.
In one paragraph the Secretary writes (1) that any fraud
throws out the medium from investigation, no matter what
her faculty and (2) that the "Fox sisters" committed frauds;
but, in the next paragraph, he concedes (3) that nevertheless
their "case" deserves investigation.
The cloud upon the memory of the Fox sisters and the
vacillating attitude of the honest Secretary are, perhaps, to be
traced to an incident that occurred upon the landing of
Maggie and Katie upon their return, in October, 1888,
from Europe. Katie was accompanied by her two sons,
"Ferdie" and "Henny." Since Dr. Taylor had seen Katie in
New York in the spring of 1887, it would appear that she had
made a trip to England in the intervening period.
The present writer's surmises as to the gathering point of
the cloud alluded to above are founded on a booklet pub
lished in 1888," which contains the following machiavellian
"dope":

"We hereby approve of Mr. Reuben B. Davenport's design

our connection therewith and we authorize him to make
proper use of all data and material that we furnish him.
New York, 15 October 1888. (Signed) Margaret Fox Kane,
Catherine Fox Jencken." This document, reproduced at the
beginning of the booklet, is no confession of "fraud." Perhaps
that is to be found here,â€”a letter of Margaret's from London,
May 14, 1888: "Spiritualism is a curse. Fanatics like Mr.
Luther R. Marsh, Mr. John L. O'SuIlivan, ex-minister to
Portugal, and hundreds equally as learned, ignore the 'rap-
pings' (which is the only part of the phenomena that is
worthy of notice) and rush madly after the glaring humbugs
that flood New York. But a harmless message that is given
through the Yappings' is of little account to them ; they want
the spirit to come in full form, to walk before them, talk to
them, embrace them, and what is the result? Like old Judge
Edmonds, and Mr. Seybert of Philadelphia, they become
crazed and at the direction of fraud 'mediums' they are in
duced to part with all their worldly possessions as well as
their common-sense," etc., etc.
In all this there is no word of recantation, only a finding
fault with those who prefer materializations to communica
tions, and at most a note of jealousy of other mediums,
coupled with a very proper warning against humbugs. In
fact, the reaffirmation of the veridicity of the phenomena is
positive; only that one kind is preferred to another.
In an interview which appeared in the New York Herald,
October 1 1, 1888, the day after Katie's arrival on the Persian
Monarch, she was reported as saying: "I care nothing for
Spiritualism. So far as I am concerned, I am done with it.
I will say this. I regard it as one of the very greatest curses

Katie throw herself upon the sympathy of the Spiritualists)
she emphatically rejected and declared that she had done
forever with Spiritualism and Spiritualists. She firmly be
lieves that leading men and women among the latter, par
ticularly her eldest sister, Leah, are her secret persecutors,
and that it was due to their animus that she was arrested last
spring and deprived of her two boys, to whom she is im
measurably devoted," etc.
This is about all there is to the "confession." Davenport
goes on to make up a book out of the well-known Hydesville
occurrences and so forth, giving to them all a liberal twist in
the cause of the fraud theory. His grand argument is that
the "raps" were entirely produced by the toe-joint. He
therefore enters the lists energetically against the various
other knee-, hip-, elbow-, jaw-, and other joint theorists. It
is so curious that this apparently simple, physiological puzzle
could not be authoritatively solved by all the committees at
Corinthian Hall, nor by the Buffalo doctors, nor by the Sey-
bert Commission, nor by any of the thousands of investi
gators. And yet Davenport is so credulous as to believe that
the Fox sisters had kept for forty years the secret of the rap
by the big toe, which they had at last divulged to him."
But if the jaw-hip-kneeologists are all wrong, why are not
also the toeologists? Because Maggie let the secret out of
the bag that it was the toeologists who were right, says
Davenport. Conclusive as the case seems to him, one is con
strained to look further for explanation of all these exaggera
tions and perversions. In order to make his accusation seem
probable, he attempts to make out that Maggie is the one,
white, ewe lamb in the dark, Fox kennel.
As it is impossible, at this late date, to become four-square
with all the circumstances surrounding this suspicious and
evidently artificial and inconsequential "confession," let us

known to professional exposers of spiritualism. They will,
of course, not deny to us a privilege of which they so freely
avail themselves.
The explanation of the "talk" of Maggie (Katie seems to
have chimed in, at times) lies in the well-known psychology
of the medium; and that this psychology is not on all hands
allowed for only proves how reluctant men are to apply sound
theory. Let us suppose that Maggie and Katie arrive to
gether from England on the Persian Monarch. There has
been much interest in them, on the passage, seances perhaps
have been held in the dining hall of the ship, and fellow
passengers have ordered wine. City reporters, scenting a
scoop, have met the steamer at Quarantine, more wine is
ordered, and Katie is asked about some affair of the Gerry
Society (and what was the animus of that?) touching on the
custody of her boys. The thought of this interference angers
her, she loses her head, and makes accusations right and left.
At the same time, Maggie is asked what she thinks of
Leah? Maggie accuses Leah of exploiting her for profit in
the tours and sittings of her girlhood, and becomes also very
angry, and Katie sympathizes with this sister. The reporters
instinctively know or maliciously feel out these weak points.
They are past masters in suggestion. Maggie and Katie are
among the best subjects for suggestion known to history.
The result is inevitable that the two women denounce spirit
ualism, â€”anything to get the best of that hated Leah, who
was really their best friend and second mother.
Add to the suggestibility of the mediums the fact that they
are probably in straitened financial circumstances, it is no
wonder that the reporters and others are able to persuade the
two sisters to attend a public meeting at the Academy of
Music, where Maggie advances on the stage and puts her foot
on a stool, a la Trilby, whereupon the great hall resounds
with "raps" coming from all parts! Such is the power of
little Maggie's toe- joint! While Katie sits approvingly in a

from intimate acquaintance with Katie, it is surprising that
she did so well. The normal life vibrates between combat
and information.
This was probably the one occasion in her life when she
was wholly without some protecting arm about her; and the
keen scent of the scandal-hound for its quarry led him
straight to her and he pounced upon her, for was not that his
living? This is a situation which the student of psychic
research must, from the start, thoroughly comprehend. Like
many truths which have been more formally received into
the social sciences, it has not occurred to men to apply it in
their daily living. Notice, in corroboration, how scant recog
nition professorial economists pay to the principles of finance
or of international trade, when they are preoccupied with
practical finance or trade. And the politicians! The "con

the medium she had always been. Otherwise much of Book
IV of the Fox-Taylor Psychic Record would not have been
written.
In the year 1888, it was the New York Herald which ap
propriated the delicious morsel of the "recantation" of the

previously, that of a Sir Oliver Lodge. Can you beat it!
The newspapers, by and large, are the best barometers of pub
lic opinion. They know what tone pays. Verily, tempora

CHAPTER VI
ROBERT DALE OWEN
(November 7, 1801-June24, 1877)
Many an evening, after the meal, a youth, I have paced up
and down the corridors of the Hotel Branting with Robert
Dale Owen. Although he had the advantage of me by fifty-
eight years, he seemed to love to tell me about his life as
American Ambassador in Naples or to recount the wonderful
deeds of the Admirable Crichton. These evenings gave me
great joy and I hastened to join my very human and warmly
expansive elder when I espied him at his constitutional exer
cise. But I could not then understand, as I do better now,
the services which he had performed both to his adopted
country and to psychic science. I did appreciate, however,
that he was a most charming and exceptional man, who pos
sessed an unusual faculty of keeping his interlocutor enter
tained.
Podmore says (Life of Robert Owen, I, 328) : "In 1853 he
(Robert Dale Owen) was appointed U. S. Minister at Naples.
Whilst there he became converted to spiritualism, and his
two books, Footfalls on the Boundary of Another World, and
The Debatable Land between this World and the Next, re
main two of the best books ever written on the subject. That
pernicious heresy never found a nobler or more persuasive
advocate." This citation, which the present writer has dis
covered subsequently to the writing of Chapter IV, supra, not
only confirms, as of the year 1906, the bias of Podmore's
earlier work, but also enables us to measure the distance he
was to travel up to 1911, when he grudgingly admitted the
evidential value of the "cross-correspondences." And why
does he write these long histories of spiritualism,

torn, he does not nourish a real acceptance? Otherwise they
were valuable only as studies of "popular psychology."
Not only had Owen represented this country at the court
of King "Bomba" (1853) but he had been continuously a
public man throughout the active period of his life. He had
been a member of the Indiana Legislature (1835), a member
of Congress from Indiana (1843), a member of a committee
of Congress to ascertain the condition of the colored popula
tion upon the promulgation of the emancipation proclama
tion, and, again, a commissioner to pass upon war claims
against the government on Ordnance and Ordnance Stores.1
Both the preliminary and final reports of the American
Freedmen's Inquiry Commission were prepared by Mr. Owen,
who was chairman.2 The war claims commission sifted out
some seventeen millions of dollars of claims which the Gov
ernment would otherwise have had to pay. As member of
Congress, Owen brought in the bill founding the Smith
sonian Institution, but confided to me that he was not proud
of his work, as he did not approve of the policy of its man
agement. I do not recall the reason for his dissatisfaction.
The fortune that Robert Owen, the father, sank in the ill-
starred community of New Harmony was not wasted if it
served to stimulate the popularity and helped to advance
the political fortunes of the son.
Robert Dale Owen's great-great-grandfather on the
mother's side was John Campbell of Glenarchy, first Earl of
Breadalbane. In 1771, the first cotton mill was built. In
1782, Owen's grandfather, David Dale, who had married a
granddaughter of the Earl, entered into partnership with
Arkwright to build and carry on the new business of making
cotton cloth by machinery. By 1784, the mills were finished.
In that year the partnership was dissolved, Dale remaining
the sole proprietor.

David Dale was a lover of his fellowman and his first duty
and care were the welfare of the factory operatives. This
auspicious beginning of great industry has not always main
tained itself in the sequel. But the dream of New Lanark
lasted a while, for Dale's daughter, Ann Caroline, married
Robert Owen, a leading English cotton mill manager, Sep
tember 30, 1799, who had already (with his partners) bought
out Dale and who became active manager of New Lanark,
"about the first of January, 1800," *
and, what is more to the
point, blossomed into the greatest philanthropist of his. time.
It is no wonder that their eldest son, Robert Dale Owen, born
November 7, 1801, was a man of energy, sincerity, intelli
gence, and deep conviction, nor that he rose to eminence in
his adopted country by his own native qualities, after the
father had dissipated a fortune in more or less wisely planned
benefactions.
A word only as to Robert Dale Owen's education need
detain us, but that word is rendered necessary by the clear
logic and excellent style and language of his writings, which
undoubtedly promoted the wide circulation which they en
joyed. The beginnings of the nineteenth century were rife
with new and Utopian schemes which, founded on other
worldly principles and often disappointed, have fortunately,
in some cases, manifested recurrent vitality until they have
captured the decisive moments of legislation or of popularity.
Temperance reform is an illustration of this trend of opinion
that will naturally occur to one. Another would be that of
self-government in schools and colleges, and also among the
youth when collected for any reason, as in the George Jr.
Republic; or among prisoners, as in the Sing Sing prison.
In 1818, Owen and his brother William, a year younger,
were sent to the school of Emmanuel von Fellenberg, at his
estate Hofwyl, two leagues from Berne. Here they remained

three years. This institution comprised a primary school, a
college, an industrial school, and workshops for improved,
agricultural instruments.* Here Robert Dale Owen became
really an educated man. He did not go to any other college,
but in the three years at Hofwyl acquired not only a good
general education but a first class command of the German
and French languages. If one wonders at the clear logic and
good, sustained style of his writings, knowing that these ac
complishments are not acquired without labor, one can only
look for the foundation to the discipline of Fellenberg at
Hofwyl.
"To an excellent friend and former colleague, the Viscount
St. Amaro, Brazilian Minister at Naples, I shall ever remain
debtor for having first won my serious attention to phenom
ena of a magneto-psychological character and to the study
of analogous subjects. It was in his apartments, on the 4th
of March, 1856, and in presence of himself and his lady, to
gether with a member of the royal family of Naples, that I
witnessed for the first time, with mingled feelings of sur
prise and incredulity, certain physical movements apparently
without material agency. Three weeks later, during an eve
ning at the Russian Minister's, an incident occurred, as we
say, fortuitously, which after the strictest scrutiny, I found
myself unable to explain without referring it to some intelli
gent agency foreign to the spectators present, â€”not one of
whom, it may be added, knew or had practiced anything con
nected with what is called spiritualism or mediumship. From
that day I determined to test the matter thoroughly. My
public duties left me, in winter, few leisure hours, but many
during the summer and autumn months; and that leisure,
throughout more than two years, I devoted to an investiga
tion (conducted partly by personal observations made in
privacy, partly by means of books) of the great question
whether agencies from another phase of existence ever inter-

vene here, and operate, for good or evil, on mankind." 8
The visible result of this activity was "Footfalls on the
Boundary of Another World," published January 1, 1860.
The psychic studies were interrupted by the Civil War and
by political activities, and by a book on the slavery ques
tion.8 The war ended, Owen resumed the thread of his
metapsychic studies, or, as he called
it,
studies in "magneto-
psychology or pneumatology," and his other large book on
this subject, "The Debatable Land between this World and
the Next," appeared in 1872.
A
novel, "Beyond the Break
ers,"
is
also to be placed to his credit.
On the topic that engages us, Owen's work was epoch-
making. Psychology having entered as
a
new, working view
point into the use and wont of the circle that guarantees
a
literature and the expenditure of printer's ink,
it
was directly
in order of the most psychological of phenomena, the recur
rent spasms of revivalism and of mysticism in its large and
quite religious sense, to claim their share in systematic, or
dered, and objective thinking.
But everything occurs through
a
process, and this time the
immediate and appropriate process was to convince the world
of the veridicity of the phenomena.
If
the phenomena them
selves are
a
sign of something, so also must preliminary signs
of that sign be given their credit. What
is
learning but a
seeking for signs? And what
is
knowledge but the systems
of signs which really work? The veridicity of the phenomena
once established, "spiritualism"
is
converted into "psychic
research," and the lines of inquiry melt away into the mass
of learning which enlivens the science of life, call
it
psy
chology, metaphysics, biology, or what you will.
The temperament, education, and gentlemanly life work
of Owen conspired to make his writings on this subject the
most important that appeared during the period of the verid-

icity campaign,â€”at least, up to his time. Of course, the
work of the societies for psychical research has been weight
ier, dealing, as it does, with current, contemporaneous phe
nomena, and leading on to the philosophical writings of
Meyer, Hyslop, Lodge, and others.
Today we hear no more of Owen. That is to be regretted.
Twenty thousand copies of the earlier book were sold in the
United States and England,7 and Charles Dickens, in All the
Year Round (September, 1860), "after dissenting from many
of its conclusions," said: "I rise from the perusal of this book
with a high regard for Mr. Owen personally. He is a gentle
man of a sweet temper, and expresses himself as a gentleman
should. He is a good writer and has an admirable power of
telling a story. That one of his stories which is called 'The
Rescue,' is by far the best of its kind to be found. Excellent
throughout, it is told with a singular propriety, modesty,
clearness, and force." 8
The writings of Capron, Edmonds, Hardinge and others
suffered from the surprise caused by the revival and from an
unwarranted assumption that the manifestations were quite
sui generis. Owen, with his continental education, took a
more cosmopolite point of view. His reading in French and
German authors on this topic put the phenomena in order in
his mind, so that the earlier work, "Footfalls," is noteworthy
for its system and for the wide field of observation. In
it,
at the outset, he seeks, in essence, to prepare the reader by
general observations on the limitations of knowledge,
al
though that rubric had not, eo nomine, occurred to him. And
he further refines the subject under the very appropriate
headings of "the impossible," "the miraculous," and "the
improbable," categories which go as far as possible to analyze
a
mass of nearly intractable material.
In Book II, he takes up the obviously familiar and yet

intensely refractory subject of sleep and dreams. While it can
not be said that he adds anything to knowledge on that topic,
that method of approaching the psychic life is reasonable. The
limitations of Owen's treatment are here manifest, for he
neglects the analysis of personality, to which this field invites.
The third book treats of hauntings. It is possible to look
on hauntings, by a popular psychology, as the next-door-
neighbors of dreams. That view is a concession to the
pseudo-scientific prejudice that hauntings, like dreams, are
"all imagination." Also,
if,
with the Greeks, we are to be
lieve that peradventure foreign personalities present them
selves propriis personis in our dreams, the appropriateness of
the topical arrangement still stands. With hauntings he can
not but associate poltergeist, which
is
apparently of the
earth, earthy. However, the classification
is
perhaps as good
as possible to one who renounces metapsychic and paraphys-
ical speculation. Indeed, the speculation up to Owen's time
had been chiefly physical, and that before the age of chemo-
and radio-physics. Owen would have had to content himself
with vague references to mesmerism, galvanism, magnetism
and the like, and he showed strong prescience in leaving
alone
a
topic still in the dough but in which enormous prog
ress has been made since his time.
In the fourth book, he easily passes over into apparitions
in general,
a
subject which first calls for
a
discussion of what
may be hallucination, and then divides itself into the heads,
universally adopted by subsequent writers, of apparitions of
the living and apparitions of the dead. In the next book,
the very interesting field
is
entered upon of interferences,
warnings, punishments; while the last book
is
upon the na
ture of death and upon the reasonableness of the belief in
the future life.
After all, the success of "Footfalls" lay in what Dickens
was so quick to observe, the excellent gift of the author for
story telling. He had ransacked the literature of the subject,

in several languages, and had selected those relations which
were the most authentic, the best corroborated. He spared
no pains to chase down clews, to interview surviving wit
nesses, to compare accounts. Of course, the critics declared
that these stories were a mass of unsupported superstition,
and it was in order to meet this objection and to furnish
severer control, that the societies for psychic research were
founded. But now that the veridicity of the phenomena has
been established by contemporaneous research and accepted
openly by wide circles and tacitly still more generally, men
will turn back to Owen's books for delightful entertainment
and instruction.
The blood of the Calvinist, however, was strong in Owen's
veins. Beneath his gentle and sympathetic, if rugged, ex
terior, lay a willingness to battle and to die for a cause.
"Footfalls" was too ingratiating to suit our canny Scotch
man. He must have a whack at the dogmatists, and the ir
repressible conflict broke out again in the next book, "The
Debatable Land," published January 1, 1872.
Owen admits that he had longed to frame a special address
to the Protestant clergy; the opportunity come, he embraced
it with eagerness. Through one hundred and fifty-nine pages
of lofty logic and purest English, his argument rolls on like
a polished, glistening, and mighty ground-wave, from the
errors of the Reformation to the necessity of a new infusion
of spiritual truth and to a marvelously well-balanced and
sincere statement of spiritualist doctrine. The present writer
has ventured a variant formulation of doctrine from the more
psychological, personal, coupled with near-cosmic point of
view of the present book; but a re-reading of Owen's state
ment convinces him that it cannot, on general principles and
for a wide publicity, be equaled, not to say surpassed.

and additional support"; here we have one formulation of
the viewpoint of spiritualism. It was, therefore, in Owen's

mind. But in the sense of a special adaptation to spiritual
ism, it received scant attention in the Address. The times
were not ripe for the dwelling upon it. The Unseen was at
the theological stadium, so far as popular presentation goes,
and theologically it must be treated. Religion also must be
treated theologically. Men were shooting parsons, not spar
rows; whereas, in our day, the old debates are pretty well
talked out, like free silver or greenbacks, and men take their
religion more simply or, anyhow, more directly, or else not at
all. That may be an advance. And yet it were a distinct
loss to one's needed sum of experience to omit the school
man's discussions in their bearings on the metapsychic phe
nomena.
Today we are enabled to proclaim a department, psychical
research, likely to absorb psychology in its quest for the es
sentials of spirituality, be it personal or cosmic. In those
days, it was a victory to convince men of the veridicity of
the phenomena. In Owen, therefore, as the man of the hour,
we are to look for a last and most brilliant attack on the
schoolman's basis.
His line of argument was calculated to prove to the open
mind of sixty years ago the necessity for some spiritual move
ment such as that of spiritualism. The present writer has
sought to work over this position into a spiritual theory. "In
every department of material and intellectual science, the
advance has been from conquest to conquest. But in pneu-
matology, says Owen, is the end already reached? Has an
investigator of religion no longer a legitimate vocation?
Shall we say of its doctrines, as a Scottish philosopher did
of the learned foundations of Europe, that they are not
without their lesson for the historian of the human mind?" 9

had narrowed and materialized the grand conception of the
mission of Christ and of all moral teachers (albeit of the
others in minor degree) by the selfish and contentious doc
trine of a Church monopoly in spiritual gifts; straight out,
the Church was and was to be the sole channel of this in-
gerence. The abuses of this monopoly, necessary though it
perhaps was among a populace which assuredly needed dis
cipline in the letter of the law moral, were manifested in the
sale of indulgences, and perpetuated in the doctrine of in
fallibility, a modern challenge to the good sense of the upper
strata enlightenment. Still worse were the early, not to say,
premature, official closing of what one might call the "open
season for miracles" and the declaration that all future
miracles also were to be exclusive, Church prerogative.
The Church, therefore, at a very early date, entered frankly
into the struggle process and thereby into the contention for
power rather than for light. If this direction given to its
endeavors had been more perspicacious, it would have been
excusable, even laudable. Its bloody persecutions are only too
eloquent witnesses that it had fallen a victim to a cunning
grammatology and to the claptrap and choplogic of cloister
debating-clubs and of their fanatical purblindness.
Nor did the Reformation remedy entirely the despiritual-
izing attitude. It gave the Bible to the masses, but it denied
to them freedom of interpretation : they must read minded to
receive the orthodox (if reformed) interpretation. The
thought that persecution was wrong or did not pay entered
the heads of only a few reformers; doubtless many Catho
lics also believed it to be a mistake. Most of the old, stand
ardized, labeled, and branded doctrines were retained by the
Reformers, especially those relating to election and dam
nation, which originated in the fevered brain of St. Paul,
working mechanically overtime, when his mighty soul was
sorely taxed.

and Calvin, who denied altogether the efficacy of good works,
registered a distinct retrogression from the standard doc
trine of the Church. They found themselves confronted with
a condition, the indulgences of a Tetzel ; not with a theory,
but with the abuse of a theory. To this they made front
by an uncalled for denial of the doctrine of works and put
their church for all time in flat contradiction with common-
sense and experience.10
However, no part of the Church's temporalizing of re
ligion counts for more and is more out of date than its adver
tised monopoly of miracles, and its doctrine that miracles are
special exercises of a direct volition of deity. The reform
ers, however, took, on this point, a different tack. They, by
and large, represented those elements of western civilization
more obnoxious to the habit of mind which arose with Roger
Bacon and Descartes, with Newton and Galileo, known as
"scientific," or the mentality of those who pay severe atten
tion to the inferences arising from systematic observation.
Precisely, miracles are those occurrences which elude a com
paratively primitive, consciously systematic observation ; and
hence the conviction of early scientists lay at hand that they
did not occur at all, or were, at most, trivial matters of imagi
nation. The Reformers thus not only denied the, in this
matter, abusive monopoly of the Church, but they fell into
the gross reaction of denying also the truth at the bottom,
which the Church had abused.
St. Augustine, who was bishop of Hippo, a.d. 395, wrote:
"They ask me, 'Why do the miracles not occur today?'
"
And
his reply was: "At this very day a multitude of miracles do
occur; the same God who caused the signs and wonders which
we read of, works similar prodigies still by such powers as
He sees fit to select." 11

Science but took one step further than Protestantism, and
by that token science constituted itself also a sort of re
ligion a rebours, for Protestantism could not deny the Chris
tian miracles and remain Protestantism. It, accordingly,
concluded to deny all miracles subsequent to the days of the
Apostles or shortly afterwards. Protestantism has been
swept too far from the psychic course. How long will the
Christian dispensation hold valid? It is idle to pretend that
the doings of the Christian era will by mere iteration of tra
dition and unshakable formalism of dogmatism perpetually
enthrall men. As those crucial days recede, more and more
become the records but records, but phrase, unless revivified
and rerealized. This need is recognized by the clergy, by
and large, but they have discovered no adequate means to
this end.
The true means,
is,
says Owen, to make
a
science of re
ligion and to study the phenomena of pneumatology.12 Uni
tarians and others have essayed to make
a
science of religion,
but
a
little observation convinces one that they need sup
plementary support from outside.
Probably the address to the Protestant clergy records the
high watermark of Owen's literary effort. But he did not
stop with that remarkable study of dogma. With undimin
ished enthusiasm, he further explored our relations and con
tacts with the Unseen. After examining, in Book
I,
claims
to human infallibility, he treats of the notable burstings
forth or mere bubblings up of spiritual insight which history
records or familiar experience suggests, not omitting an ex
cellent treatise on demonology. Belief in the Devil
is
put
in its right place of imperfect acquaintance with the phe

them. This subject leads over to that of inspiration, which
is
ascribed to lower or higher powers according to the pre-

possessions of men. The inspiration of Christ is treated
with vigor and after mature reflection, and states only what
must be the spiritualist stand: It is possible that the con
ception of Christ was unusual; the power of faith is enor
mous. Christ was not infallible and made some minor
errors of statement. His inspiration cannot be overestimated
and is not yet realized in its fullness. His miracles are in
agreement with little known laws of intermundane exertions
of will-power.
Then follows a new collection of authentic phenomena,
classified, not on a scale of materiality, as in "Footfalls,"
but under a clever system well calculated to fortify the fore
going arguments by showing: the variety of the contacts with
another world (Book II), the power of the physical mani
festations (Book III), the identity of personalities, some
times ancient (Book IV), the special appearance of
apparitions to relieve the grief or reassure the doubts of
surviving mortals (Book V), cures and prophecies (Book
VI). The whole work concludes with a most explicit and
logical statement of the respective errors of Catholic and
Protestant churches on the subjects of miracles, infallibility,
and immortality.
The best ghost-story is the account of the experiences and
dreams of the musician, N. C. Bach, concerning a spinet of
Henri III, which he had purchased at an antiquary's. In
this episode, Baltazzarini, the King's master of entertain
ments, plays the role of revenant.
Interesting, also, is the appearance to Mr. Owen, at a
seance in Boston, Mass., in 1867, of the spirit of a very
dear friend whom he calls "Violet" and who had died some
thirty years before (p. 474). We are betraying no secret
if we are so bold as to identify her with Jessie, the youthful
passion of Owen, to whom he had almost, but not quite, pro
posed marriage.13

CHAPTER VII
THE PRESENT STATE OF OUR PSYCHIC KNOWLEDGE
We are told that the sciences are the lineal descendants
of primitive religion, or, frankly, of superstition. Religion
furnished the start at accounting for things. Primitive man
was enough of a communist to consider that the world owed
him a good time and that interference with a good time was
abominable and the work of devils incarnate. If after long
and appropriate tests he could not discover the offender, then
the latter must be a spirit, an unseen man. Religion was
directed wholly towards appeasement, sacrifice, even of hu
man victims. When real, psychic manifestations occurred,
there were thus doctrinal spirits ready to perform them;
but then the spirits answered to what we call "devils."
With the advent of civilization, state religion gradually
abolished or outgrew human sacrifice, the devils were com
plemented and finally almost effaced by those grandiose but
selfish beings who populated Olympus; and the inner clique
of philosophers arose who not taking essential existence for
granted founded a positive knowledge upon exact observation
and necessitated, as part of state policy, a thorough system
of education. Savages had educated their children in the
bow and arrow and in expiatory rites. The newly cultured
educated theirs in reading and writing.
A distinct, conscious mental life thus arose, which was
benign. It opposed a beneficent God to the stultifying Devil,
it offered one human sacrifice for all the race and for all
time. But the special psychic phenomena still occurred, the
same openings from the invisible (although refined pari passu
with the nascent culture). Even savages had cultivated them
in restricted circles, in their ceremonial tepees, hogans, or

kivas. It was not until the period of modern democracy
that the ghostly rites could be thrown open to all the world.
This does not mean that they are today without a survival
of ancient hierarchical exclusiveness. Democracy is indi
vidualistic â€”it leaves to the individual his choice of religion
and of rite and of spiritual circle. He will not choose a com
munion where he is not wanted or where the communicants
are uncongenial, or where he is frowned upon.
The world had at last substituted Ormuzd for Ahriman.
But just as generation occurs by fission, so culture marches
on scission and even schism. If the gods were beneficent
then ought not man to be content with his lot? Or, on the
other hand, should he not believe in a better, more perfect,
transliminal, additional existence? It is evident that the in
vention of a God of goodness had not solved the problem
of survival. Nor can the devil worshipers who are still
numerous, help out the solution by consigning every one to
hell. Their solution is very uninteresting; the good solution
offers enough difficulties, which have always been glossed
over, never settled once for all, by either religion or science.
The choice offered by Ormuzd â€” I mean the choice of
heaven on earth or heaven in heaven (heaven at any rate)
is an unavoidable problem in ambiguity. It is forced upon
us (1) by our push toward perfectibility and (2) by the
doctrine of evolution. Evolution teaches that each species
is adapted to live in its definite environment. Remove it to
another, it dies out. Environments are general or special.
In other words, some are inclusive or differ more than others.
If the evolutionary doctrine be taken materialistically, it is
a doctrine of limitations and may be invoked to confine
heaven to earth. It may, however, be accepted spiritually
and then is adapted to drive further the expanding views
of science concerning what is material; nor does it need to
locate the frontier of heaven where science may happen to
draw the line of the material, for science is obviously not

interested in proving immortality; while psychic research has
a perfect right to put the frontier where good sense and the
psychic phenomena indicate it ought to lie.
The psychic phenomena have been alluded to as coeval
with the race. If man is the laughing animal, or the con
ceptual animal, or the straight walking biped, he is also the
superstitious animal, the ghost seeing animal. That other
animals also see ghosts only goes to stress the preeminence
of man in this talent. Modern criticism has at length ac
cepted the veridicity of the phenomena. The battle was a
long one: it may be said to have lasted a hundred years, from
the Rochester Rappings of 1848 nearly down to the present
day. But that battle is won, thanks to Wallace and Crookes
and Lodge, to Owen and Edmonds and Hare. I am sorry
that the American names do not press upon one so readily as
the English and continental. The next task, the one which
now imposes itself, is that of interpreting the phenomena:
the one before me today is that of the interpretation of the
automatic writing, and, in the first place, the automatic
writing known as the Fox-Taylor Record.
To us who take this text seriously, the first impulse is to
apply the same criteria as those applied to ancient biblical
or other inspired writings, the test of discovering their signifi
cance as allegories:
Are they to be interpreted as allegories pointing to an
earthly heaven or as allegories pointing to a heavenly
heaven? Mentalities participating in the scientific move
ment and taking their cue from it will strive to explain the
psychic phenomena so as to draw from them support for it;
while those researchers who are of a religiousâ€”metaphysical-
poetic turn of mind will endeavor to show the inconsistency
of some, at any rate, of the manifestations with any hypothe
sis of utopianism.

may be, we adapt our habits of speech to it and adopt the

presumption of literalness only when words manifestly apply
to it. In short, there are no other words at our command.
Often, therefore, the application of such words in a way
meant to describe another environment may be mistaken as
describing the literal environment. This error is a form of
materialism. This perversion of the tropical back to the
tangible, back to the commonsense environment, to the
visible earth, is circular reasoning, is a linguistic seduction
calculated to prove that no multiplicity of environments
exists, through simply refusing to make the application of
analogy originally intended. It is no proof that nothing lies
beyond. It is hard to establish a sweeping negative. The
natural presumption runs counter to it.
On the other hand, if we start from a prejudice in favor
of multiple environments, mathematical physics are a
fulcrum or lever further in that same direction; for the calcu
lations of science, starting from the assumption of the exist
ing familiar material, soon transcend material, but keep up
the scientific pace quite scornful of the old tests of weight
and measure. Mathematical physics has proved a help to the
idea of extra environments, because they are self-created by
the formulae themselves. The calculator is relieved of re
sponsibility for the seeing, feeling, or appreciating of them
(for which his profession quite unfits him) otherwise than in
and through the formulae. It is true that geometricians
endeavor to lend graphic form to the algebraic formulae, but
with indifferent success. The language of the algebraic equa
tion is thus more forth-putting and far-reaching than that
of scroll and parchment, although generally restricted to the
apparently minute objective of a general formula for the
location of any point of the given system.
Thus science has outstepped its tests of weight and meas
ure in favor of the heavenly heaven.

course about the future life, so are the communicating "dis

embodied spirits" hobbled in all their efforts to explain or
give satisfactory pen-pictures of their habitat, occupations,
polity, even of their own persons, sustenance, influence, and
place in a natural order. It is precisely in the view of over
coming this disadvantage that the sustained, continuous (if
suffering long breaks) enterprise of the Fox-Taylor Record
was undertaken and we may say, carried to a successful ter
mination. It was a great work. But that is not all: the
remarkable, supernormal portraits were done, of Frankie,
Leila, Grandma and Leila, Olin and Leila. The originals
are colored with crayons in the most delicate way, and I
hope that reasonably good colored prints can be made of
them. The photographs and half-tones, at any rate, repro
duce the incredibly fine line work.
One must decline to believe that the intention of these
supernormal works of art was to present a stunt of what
spirits can do when they want to show off to mortals. On
the contrary, the purpose was, by pictorial art, to comple
ment the consistent, long-sustained (if impossible) textual
expose of the other world, this their gazetteer of heaven. The
pictures are an incorporate and consummate part of this
carefully planned handbook. Note the astounding prediction
that nothing like them will ever again be made! How fre-^
quently we run across such phrases: "Words fail to do justice
to the beauty." . . . "Nothing in your world gives any con
ception of the grandeur, the sublimity, of ours"; "At this
point I pause; the pencil refuses to trace further!"
Do abstract nouns, "beauty," "knowledge," "thought,"
"strength," "life," "love," "earth," "humanity," "society,"
"effort," "ambition," or the negatives, such as "evil," "ha
tred," "malice," "dishonesty," "destructiveness," "wanton

biological adaptation have been impressed upon our minds
by the divine Purpose for our good but are wholly devoid
of objectiveness?
The utilitarian view, then, is that the abstract ideas are
clothed in a certain, deceptive definiteness for our good and
for the good of the race, and that religions exist as the in
struments of this pious fraud. Devil worship, then, is a sort
of undeception, which tells the truth for our undoing! Is
the world essentially so confused and illogical? Do we live
a lie?
Or is there an honest-to-goodness heaven, not of this earth?
Religion teaches the latter view, but science has generally
adopted the former and has riddled religion with skepti
cism. Scientific churchgoers accept the utilitarian fixed idea
without loss of standing. Much of religious doctrine adapts
itself to it. Oriental imagery covers doctrinal lapses. Re
ligion emasculated by modernism finds itself precisely unable
to resist the onslaughts of this materialism â€”the materialism
of confining the substance of the spiritual to carnal imagery.
However, Religion driven to the wall, reacts with a rejec
tion of science in toto, â€”with a declaration of independence
from weight and measure, â€”with the challenge to every man
to search for God in his own heart, â€”inventing the profound
phrase that man is created in the image of his Maker.
This transcendental argument is effective or satisfying
with and to only a small but not a mean portion of the con
gregations nor even to the whole body of the clergy. The
thinking world had long ago been pretty well documented
and indoctrinated by science â€”an admirable thing, in its
way, and quite an essential stage in the march of human
progress; but the world moves and things are occurring to
shake and invalidate this surrender to the conviction of the
finality of the preconceived and hard frozen contentment
and satisfaction with the stage of conception of the play of
life which science had first offered and then imposed.

PRESENT STATE OF PSYCHIC KNOWLEDGE 133
In so many words: is the idealism of the race a body of
fairy tales instituted by a Gog and Magog yclept "Utility,"
persuading men bravely to do and be good, independently
of reward or rewarded only in a chance, a representative, or a
figurative way?
Or does it express in its own way a flat-footed, objective
truth?
The latter must be the answer adopted by Religion. But
the world is drifting against the religious current. However,
science may at last become Religion's sympathetic ally. It
is offering every aid today by its dematerializing of material,
so that the science of physics is become a science of numbers
and quantities, an algebra which has absorbed and digested
material.
Something abstractly potent had to be done about the drift
of humanity away from morality. For since the World War
the relaxation of morals everywhere is only too manifest.
Economic and esthetic conditions have profoundly changed.
Men have been cut loose from their moral moorings. No
truth was in sight inviting to make fast. Physics had even
declared for an infinite possibility of systems. Any imagi
nable environment was a "good enough Morgan till after
election."
The time was ripe for a new manifestation of an objec
tivity both outside of ordinary experience and outside of
what science had heretofore regarded as the attainable limits
of the knowable. It was offered with the Rochester Rappings.
Let us study whether the world was spiritually stimulated.
The world had been through similar psychic crises and
mental culs de sac which had run along parallel lines, allow
ance made for dissimilarities due to later time and altered
place. This book does not attempt a sketch of previous

the like; but assumes that the reader would be glad to pos

pings, as an introduction to a brief account of the Fox-Taylor
Record, and its more obvious contents.
Let the reader carefully register that the author does not
present either the Record or this his own book about the
Record as proving immortality, or even survival. It may be
that the successive Messiahs and Openings and Revelations
and Gospels, the mysteries and burnt offerings, which our
old world has witnessed, have been in principle what agnos
ticism proclaims: their several bibles and legends are in
particular severally only a fillip to faith and research, a new
spur to further if helpless and disappointing struggles, efforts,
and upward climbings. It may be so.
/ And yet, it may not be so. Close conning of spiritual his-
/ toryâ€”which is all of history worth knowing â€”has revealed
no proof of another world convincing to him who did not
want to be convinced; and, on the other hand, he who wanted
to be convinced has never had to search far for satisfying
proofs. It would therefore be the height of folly to attempt
an irrefutable demonstration of the future life, much more
\ so to attempt to describe it. And yetâ€”so remarkable a piece
of imagery as that offered by the Fox-Taylor Record, in
pleasing artistically, does also give food for thought. One
could not claim that the flowing paths, the journeys among
the stars, the Palace, the Banquet Hall, the festivals, the
faintly portrayed studies and occupations, are to be taken
literally in a merely everyday sense. But the physical mani
festations, the harp, above all the mysterious, mystical draw
ings and portraits, the "raps" or "echoes," the explosions, the
jokes, the somber interruptions, the business advice, are
something very literal. To explain the writings as drawn
from human minds does not explain them away. To assign
them to an intangible world, does not destroy them. To
materialize them as hailing from another but material world,
another dimension, does but assert a real, the most real of
heavens.

"Immortality" is like most other terms: highly ambiguous,
highly subject to preconceived interpretation. It carries the
conviction which language can carry, but nothing more. We
read other books only for the field they offer for the play
of our own reason, not because they contain reason itself.
Read the Fox-Taylor Record in the same way!
We thus arrive at a transcendental objectivity. It makes
no difference, in last analysis, where heaven is or of what it is
made. If it satisfies the need we have for heaven, we shall
believe in
it,
and we can find no other test of truth â€”till the
time comes. Further objectivity does not anywhere exist â€”
is
impossible. In the Absolute, we may be able to identify
and fix in lapidary letters some one place, history and eternal
law, but such
is
not the nature of the conditions of this mun
dane life. Life comes to us piecemeal and so does our power
of attention, and memory reseparates the parts and deprives
us of the power and vision of the whole.
Life
is
a
wonderful thing.
It
does not give us the tools
objective or material of proving anything for good; we are
not much superior to our own defective speech. The mani
festations recorded in the Fox-Taylor Record and abun
dantly elsewhere are just as valid, just as objective, just as
convincing as any experiment in physicsâ€”perhaps more so.
It
is
equally true that
a
final interpretation of them defies
finiteness.

CHAPTER I
THE MAKING OF THE RECORD
IT was in 1865 that Katie was brought by Dr. Bayard,
a homeopathic physician residing in Fortieth Street, New
York City, to the "Swedish Movement Cure" of Dr. George
H. Taylor, as a suitable boarding place. Dr. Bayard lived
in that narrow, gothic house, just west of Fifth Avenue and
facing north toward the Croton Reservoir, which then occu
pied the site now appropriated by the Tilden Library. Dr.
Taylor's establishment included the two houses located on
the northeastern corner of Sixth Avenue and Thirty-eighth
Street and still (1930) standing. George Henry Taylor was
born in Williston, Vermont, January 4, 1821. He studied
medicine at the Harvard and New York medical schools, and
visited Sweden in 1858 in order fully to appreciate, at the
source, the Swedish passive gymnastics for chronic invalids.
On his return he invented, with the traditional ingenuity of
the natives of his home state, steam-driven machines for mas
sage, â€”perhaps the first systematic application of vibratory,
artificial power to curative purposes. He died in New York
City, at the Dalhousie Apartments, 49 West 59th Street,
December 9, 1896.
Mrs. Sarah Elizabeth (Langworthy) Taylor was born in
North Stonington, Connecticut, May 18, 1828. She gradu
ated from Alfred Academy, Allegany County, New York,
under the inspiring instruction of Principal, later President,
William C. Kenyon (1812-1867). In 1854 she became Lady
Principal in the Plainfield (N. J.) High School, and in 1856
married Dr. Taylor. She died at Lincoln, Nebraska, August
25, 1906. She had established a home there for her surviving
child, William.

140 KATIE FOX
Katie's arrival at the Taylors' occurred in the heyday of
sanitariums, diet reform, water-cures, high thinking, and
plain living. There were many perfectly well persons who
boarded at the Swedish Movement Cure, on account of its
home atmosphere, or who took occasionally the mechanical
massage as a means of recuperation from the fatigues of
business.
In the autumn of 1869, Dr. and Mrs. Taylor were suffer
ing from the crushing blow of the recent loss of two chil
dren, Frankie and Leila, aged respectively three years and
eighteen months. The first-born, Willie, alone survived.
Like thousands of other bereaved parents, they were apt
pupils in spiritualism, and it was no chance that brought
Katie Fox to their abode. It is doubtful if the history of
spiritualism can show another so persistent and consistent a
circle, records so faithfully kept, more complete precautions
and isolation from outside interference, and such guaranties
against internal deception.
Leila (Sarah Eliza Taylor, b. Dec. 27, 1865) died of scar
let fever, February 25, 1867. The subsequent winter,1 the
channel of immortal demonstration began to clear. A
boarder at the Swedish Movement Cure was a Mrs. Lang,
whose husband was a clerk in A. T. Stewart's store in Cham
bers Street. This lady introduced a lady friend who was a
medium and totally unacquainted with any of the Taylor
family. The latter was asked, "If any one there knew Eliza?"
She went into a trance and personated Mrs. Taylor's mother,
Eliza Lewis Langworthy, who died in 1860, aged fifty-four

THE MAKING OF THE RECORD 141
bedsore in her ear. This lady's mediumship left her, subse
quently.
Katie Fox, over thirty years old, had been at this time
long, if not firmly, established in the household which was
Dr. Taylor's Swedish Movement Cure. Indeed, her presence
had in it something of the clandestine, since she was not
permitted to attend the general table. It was in the winter
of 1865-6 that Mrs. Rogers, the housekeeper, had admitted
Katie at the instance of Dr. Bayard, alluded to, in a pre
vious chapter, as one of the prominent New Yorkers in
terested in the investigation of spiritualistic phenomena.
The memorandum states, "The continuous record began in
1869 (November). Dr. Bayard must have ceased to pay
her board before that." Anyhow, with the passing of the
main line of intermundane correspondence over to the Taylor
family, the burden of supporting Katie passed over to them
also. No one paid her board after the assistance from Dr.
Bayard ceased. Katie was a charge on the Taylors. In
the summer of 1867, she had succumbed to the thirst for
liquor and was absent for a few months. Otherwise she
lived right on at the Movement Cure from 1865 until she
went to Europe, October, 1871. But she never sat at the
public table.
"One fine day in March (1869) she sent for Mrs. Taylor.
It was Grandpa Langworthy who had (through the echoes)
insisted on talking with Mrs. Taylor until Katie was con
strained to send for her." Loss of children and fortuitous
rencontre with a medium of fugitive endowments ushered
in the epochal intercourse of the Taylors with the great
seeress.
The Psychic Legacy and Record of Dr. and Mrs. Taylor
occupies four manuscript volumes, of 227, 189, 362, and 433
pages respectively, or altogether 1,211 closely written pages.
These embrace 1,367 different written communications, be

the pages are letter size, and, with one short exception, in
the handwriting of Mrs. Taylor. The procedure was for
Katie to write the messages with her left hand, in pencil,
backwards, the so-called mirror-writing, on long strips of
brown paper, which were afterwards destroyed as too bulky
for storage. These messages were read off by Dr. Taylor
with the aid of a mirror, usually a hand-glass, and written
down from his dictation by Mrs. Taylor, who added a com
plete description of all the sittings, in language simple and
devoid of all superfluity, which calls for no editing. Mes
sages spelled from the echoes were also recorded by Mrs.
Taylor, when their preservation promised to be useful.
The first message was recorded in November, 1869; and
the last, June 1, 1892, or twenty-two and a half years after
wards. Katie died four weeks and four days later. She was
born in 1839. Her early career is set down in the preceding
Book I. It is probable that the Record contains the chief
remains of her later mediumship and especially of her auto
matic writing.2 The sittings, however, were far from con
tinuous over the entire period of twenty-two and a half years.
Indeed, the hiatus were greatly in the majority. The longest,
two, continuous series were the first and third. The first
closed with her departure for Europe, October 7, 1871. The
day before, Olin had written through her hand: "Katie, we
will all follow you with our protection, and now God bless
you and return you a well and happy girl." S. E. L. T. adds,
after describing the flowers and the crowd at the steamer, to
see her off: "Very few of those about her were people whom
I knew. Still I fancied that they had each his secret heart
ache, not only at parting with Katie, but at seeing the very
means of communication between them and some loved one,
dearer to them than their own lives,â€”the readable link be-
2 The Livermore records cover approximately the same length of con
tinuous sittings, and are probably more important as a description of mate
rialization; but they are not accessible, so far as the writer knows, save
through the selections transcribed by Owen in "The Debatable Land."

to mortalsâ€”borne far, far away. The unconscious, thought
less child little realized the deprivation her best friends were
imposing upon themselves, voluntarily, for her sake! She is
gone. The magnificent ship has left its moorings and Katie
is riding the billows."
"My heart aches for poor, helpless Katie. Could I always
keep her near me I would thankfully do all that mortal can
for her, but that I cannot do. She has so many friends who
are exactly unlike us and do by her and influence her just as
we do not. The consequence is that our influence is almost
lost upon her. Many who fawn about her mean well to
wards her, but are morally and spiritually weak; hence she
is a thousand times worse off with them than she would be
left to herself. Others care not for the little waif, only for
what they can get out of her. With Dr. Franklin, I say from
the bottom of my soul, 'May God and all good angels go
with her, guide her, and protect her.'
"
The first period was, therefore, of a little less than two
years.
There were letters from her and also communications of
the circle, from London. In 1874, she returned as Mrs. H. D.
Jencken, with her little boy, Ferdie, and went to her sister's
house, Mrs. Underbill's, in West 37th Street, where her sec
ond child, Henry, appears to have been born. The second
series begins in March, 1875, when she came to the Hotel
Branting, the new sanitarium of Dr. and Mrs. Taylor, at
Madison Avenue and 58th Street, and stayed till a few days
before she sailed back to England, about July 5, 1875.
Therefore, the second period covered but four months.
Her husband, the international lawyer, Jencken, of Dutch
parentage, having died, Katie returned to New York with her
children in the spring of 1885. Mrs. Underhill had been
unable to give S. E. L. T. any news about Katie, when in
quiry had been made of her, earlier that season; but sud

denly, in July, she and Katie called together at the Madison
Avenue Hotel, the name now borne by the enlarged Hotel
Branting. The seances recommenced at once and continued
till June 28, 1886. On the following July 2d, the Taylor
family of four sailed for Europe. Between that date and
October, 1889, Dr. and Mrs. Taylor made several trips to
Europe. On April 6, 1890, Katie called at the Madison
Avenue Hotel. S. E. L. T. writes, "It had been nearly three
years since the Doctor had seen her and four since she and
I had met." Therefore, August, 1887, when Dr. Taylor made
a voyage to Europe, must be put as the end of the third pe
riod, which would thus sum up two years and two months.
The fourth period began April 6, 1890, and ended March
4, 1891, or eleven months.
The fifth period extended from February 15, 1892, to June
1st of the same year, or three and one-half months.
The summary runs :
First period: 2 years
Second period: 4 months
Third period: 2 years 2 months
Fourth period: 11 months
Fifth period: 3>4 months
Total : Five years, eight and one-half months of sustained
and continuous seances or "unbroken chain," the account of
which is faithfully recorded in the 1,211 manuscript pages of
the Fox-Taylor Record.

CHAPTER II
THE MEDIUM
(a) Her Power and Type
The purpose of the following analysis of the Fox-Taylor
Record is not to arrive at a new theory of the psychic phe
nomena but to provide the reader of the Record with a
summary of the messages, collected for convenience under
distinct titles. This treatment at once puts in relief the
human side and suppresses the hiatus and confusion caused
by the briefness of the seances. Generally it was the physi
cal phenomena, especially the pictures, that furnished the
continuity but broke the more theoretical or poetic passages.
The Record marks a distinct advance beyond the era of
contention for veridicity. The larger task of interpreting
a psychic record lies before students of this subject. For
this purpose the work of the best medium will evidently
yield the best result. The best medium I should define as
the one who works untiringly with the least injection of her
own personality. Only a careful and unabridged perusal of
the whole record can adequately stamp and seal the purity
of the mediumship of Katie Fox. The unfailing reappear
ance of Olin, Benjamin Franklin, Grandma, Uncle Albert,
Father Taylor, Professor Kenyon, Isaac T. Hopper, William
H. Vanderbilt (after his death in 1885) and of the children,
Frankie and Leila, always acting their parts true to life,
and of the shorter parts, appropriately introduced, of
Emeline, Bradley, Mary Burton, old Sabra, Uncle Isaac,
Cousin Frank, Charley Foster, and of various other persons
and personages, like Professor Hare, lends to the whole col
lection a narrative and, I may say, a truly epic interest,

which thrills one to the very core. The pathos of this drama
belongs to its primitive type of bible in the Taylor family
religion, their lares and penates. What most attracts the
family
is,
naturally, rather repellent than otherwise to the
public.
I
therefore seek,
in
this account, to reduce to
a
minimum, that personal, often emotional element.
The bright phase of spiritualism as
a
family religion does
not occur to those who frequent the open sessions of the
public seance. Necessarily, the new irruption of metapsychic
influence at Hydesville and Rochester in 1848 was, from the
beginning, public property. The Fox family naturally ran
to their neighbors for help.
It
soon became evident that
the little girls, Maggie and Katie, children of their par
ents' later married life, had
a
reenforcing influence,
a
"power,"
if
such
a
term may be applied to slender children
of nine and twelve years.1
The preternatural noises and interruptions became so no
torious that the Fox family were put upon the defensive.
They won friends, but the public was inimical. The friends
decided that safety required action. The instances of the
witches and of the inquisition were fresher then than now.
In Spain, the last heretic had been burned at the stake in
1781;* in England, the valedictory of evangelical violence
had been celebrated nearly
a
century earlier. Consequently,
the public meetings and committees held and constituted at
Rochester were planned as
a
sort of prophylactic,
a
taking
of the bull by the horns. Katie was not present at these
Rochester meetings, having been taken to Auburn by Mr.
E. W. Capron, to whom we owe the sincere book which must
remain the best source of information on these marvelous
if
not miraculous events. Leah (Mrs. Underhill, then Mrs.
Fish) and Maggie underwent the agonies of the Rochester
public inquisition.

THE MEDIUM 147
That the whole affair of the manifestations and consequent
public excitement was not of the Fox' seeking is further
proven by the fact that it was two years later that they,
finding themselves cut off from other source of livelihood,
and the channels of supermundane demonstrations and
evangels, were forced to charge a fee for their interviews,
or retire to the obscurity of the parental farm." Even that
alternative was, in effect, denied them. They tried it; and
were practically driven out of house and home by para-
physical remonstrances which gave them no peace till they
consented to spread their new gospel, or rather, to let it
spread itself, by offering themselves as channels of communi
cation. Mrs. Underhill's book, "The Missing Link," de
serves full credence on this point. The converts ran into
the millions.
In another connection, I have related the general course
of events, including the unfortunate "confession" of and by
Maggie and Katie, on their return from Europe in 1888.
This episode appears never to have been alluded to in the
intercourse of Katie with the Taylors. I do not recall that
my parents ever mentioned it in my presence. They prob
ably regarded it as what it was, a proof of the susceptibility
of the mediums to external influences, in this case quite
earthly and of the basest sort. It is to be noted that there
must have been a trip to Europe by Katie during the hiatus
of 1887-1890. The Taylorsâ€” except W. G. L. T., who was
already abroadâ€”sailed again for Europe in June, 1888, while
Katie apparently returned from Europe in August of the
same year.
The "confession" has induced men to shun psychic re
search or to disbelieve in the Fox sisters, because they com
mit the error of looking upon the latter as the active apostles
of a religion, whereas they were the passive media of a

fresh wave of metapsychic influence. Christ, with all his
intellectual keenness and casuistic training, abstraction made
of his divine attributes, was rather the medium, St. Paul
the founder of Christianityâ€”the apostle to the Gentiles.
Katie was no founder; and whatever she may have said,
in a moment of weakness, overpersuasion, and near intimida
tion, anyhow of nagging, harassment, and despair, has not
the remotest bearing on her mediumship. Common honesty
should force this admission from the impartial observer. It
is astonishing that those perfectly cognizant of this distinc
tion between the sensitive and the militant, should for a
moment have ignored it and allowed themselves to counte
nance an indiscriminating calumny.
(III 225 *) May 5, 1871. Olin writes: "Katie is nerv
ous and extremely weak. She is low spirited. We hope
she will look ahead and see how bright the future is. The
world has much to thank her for, from the first little echo.
Through her this great truth has been established. Oh,
Katie! appreciate yourself more. It grieves us when she is
sad."
(II 8) April 28, 1870. "There are influences, dear
Sarah, which we cannot overcome (two ladies in the back
room). We find it difficult now to write, seeing the thoughts
and feelings, the spheres in the back room. It is this keen
perception, sensitiveness, inward feeling, which makes Katie

feel their presence and converse with them at times as freely
as with our precious Willie who is still left to our care. And
Willie too talks with his brother as though he saw him by his
side. And now let me state here, that during all this long
time, through each of the meetings described, Katie's hands
have both been held all of the time, and no other human
being but we three has ever been in the room, so that the
possibility of deception of any sort does not exist.
"I thank my God and my angel loved ones for my knowl
edge of and acquaintance with this poor, helpless Katie, so
simple and childlike, still bright and quick; as sensitive as a
quivering leaf and irritable as an inflamed eye."
(I 226) April 24, 1870. "Katie's dress was pulled, but
they seldom take hold of her in any manner, owing perhaps
to the fact that every touch alarms her greatly."
(IIl 273) June 11, 1871. B. F. predicts that Katie will
go to Europe, and adds: "Seek us not elsewhere."
(IIl 306) July 14, 1871. Ma writes through Katie:
"Your children live for you here and love you deeply. It is
therefore we feel (sic) a love for Katie like unto our own
family and we want the tie never to be broken. Cheer your
poor Katie, at all times, Sarah, my child. We wish to come
through none but her. This may seem selfish to you, but
we know Katie and we know that she loves you."
(IIl 315) It will be instructive to quote the description
of a seance, as well as the communication:
"July 26, 12 M., 1871. Later in the day the appointment
was changed to this hour. We three sat about the table
and chatted as usual. Katie did not even take a pencil in
her hand, but when we opened our eyes we found upon
the bureau the following letter written in the strong, bold
hand of its author. On these occasions, when they write
with their own hands, they never bring the picture.

a few days for the love he had to her. Now if you loved

your heart of hearts that some proof might be given, have

Such was the whole of one sitting; and it well qualifies the
character of Katie's mediumship.

that Katie never lacked for employment. For instance, the

scant consolation. It is more remarkable that during the
nearly six continuous or twenty-two inclusive, broken years,
she served the Taylor circle eagerly and without pecuniary
reward. There was some influence at work there outside
of "the market."
(b) Her Unwittingness
(I 208) April 17, 1870. S. E. L. T. was reading a mes
sage and asked for an explanation: "Katie asked for the
pencil and Olin said: 'Katie was on the very step almost of
eternity and we knew that if she went out the next day,
Wednesday, death would have come from the suffering she
would have endured.
"
'She would have drank her last; and we meant that if
Katie would only abstain for a length of time, she would
have health and happiness and sweet flowers, sweet friends,
and angels should be her companions, instead of those vile
roots which grow to weeds and drag down the good and
those who are easily led. We had the most serious consul
tation, which will save her. She was so sick when we tried
to write Tuesday night that we could not place our meaning
understandingly. . . . Olin.'
"
Imagine a normal person
writing all that about herself!
(I 217) And again: "During the session (April 22, 1870)
they said, 'Now we will tell you the cause of our not having
a meeting last night. First, we had our own duties to at
tend to. Secondlyâ€”no, we will write it for we do not wish
Katie to hear.' Then Katie took the pencil; and, in the
darkened room, with her eyes closed, the pencil wrote as
follows:

right path. As we are not always able to be with her, and
as we saw clearly that something had to be done without
the least uncertainty, we gathered for that express purpose.
The circle were all present. Dr. Franklin consulted with a
power even higher than himself, and out of the whole num
ber he chose Professor Kenyon and his wife to stand by
Katie almost constantly, for a time unlimited. When they

a duty as any we have here. She shall not sleep out of his
influence, and it will be far greater than earthly vigils. Now,
Sarah, you can feel at ease. . . . Olin.'
"
Note the implication that good and bad influences assail
us in our sleep.
(II 51, 172) Frequently, when absent, Katie was di
rected by raps or writing to repair to the Taylors'. She
obeyed sometimes against her will.
(II 56) June 2, 1870. Katie "wrote a few words and
stepped toward a mirror to read
it,
saying, 'It
is
about me.
I
know my name
is
written there.'
I
at once took
it,
telling
her that
I
must see
it
first.
I
read this: 'Private. We will
meet at nine, but say nothing to Katie. B. F.' Katie had
found Maggie 'in
a
fearful state of intoxication, and
it
was
over this sister that she had worn herself out for the day.'
When she had gotten ready for bed, the pencil wrote, 'Meet
at nine. B. F. and Olin.' Katie cried: 'If
I
had known
this
I
would not have come back now.
I
would have gone
to see Mag.' They are continually doing this sort of
thing through her own hand in their effort to keep evil from
her."

8,
1870. Katie
is
told by Professor
Kenyon: "Katie read your message."

this is a divine gift to be able to talk with those who are
waiting for you on the other side. Why! you do not realize
it. What happiness should be yours! Try to be sensible
and understand that you are blessed."
(II 114) July 13, 1870. Katie is awakened by echoes
to an appointment.
(II 78) June 16, 1870. "Katie did not come again until
Friday evening at twelve o'clock in the worst possible con
dition, etc."
(II 79) June 20, 1870. (Probably the next day.)
"Katie still very miserable but we had a short meeting: . . .
'Katie, try to take courage once more, to feel some ambition,
and remember you are with those who see you, although
unseen. Dress as well as you can and try to be happy in

Later: . . .
"The past is sad and her heart is more sorrowful, but re

(Ill 69) December 4, 1870. "Had it not been for two
guardian spirits of the girl (Katie) for the past week (end

hands; perhaps died in her weakness."
(Ill 282) June 20, 1871. Katie is told that she gives
so much strength to the seances that she must go to bed
by ten.
(Ill 333) August 19, 1871. . . . "Katie will soon be

which always accompany partings. Let your memories live
on the past and never let the darkening of doubt hover over
you for one moment. . . . B. F."
(IV 320) May 17, 1886. W. H. V. writes that if he had
known about Katie and what she could do, he would have
settled an income on her so that she would have been free
from all care and worry.
(c) Her Weakness
Katie's one weakness was wine. As previously explained,
the father had been a drinking man in his earlier married
life, so much so that Mrs. Fox was obliged to leave him.
After a separation of ten years, the couple were again
united, and Maggie and Katie were born. But the re
form of the father did not save these youngest children
(there were six altogether) from inheriting "the taste for
liquor," which probably, in the case of this family as of
many others, meant a sensitive organization which responded
to all sorts of stimuli with a force that exceeded ordinary
requirements and good judgment. From the point of view
of the exploitation of these girls in the spiritual telegraph,
the problem evidently was that of developing this sensitive
ness to the highest degree, since it served as relay-battery
for the telegraph, and at the same time of prolonging its life
to the utmost, so that it should not be burnt out by short-
circuiting or by overcharging, which the liquor habit would
cause.
Spiritual protection was not always efficient.
(II 29) May 7, 1870. "Saturday evening Katie kept an
engagement with a very fashionable family on Fifth Avenue.
She went well and happy, but came back at ten o'clock,
sick and crazy with brandy. The next morning, May 8th,

(II 43) May 25, 1870. Robert Dale Owen obtained a
promise from Katie to abstain for six months. "I have hard
work to retain the paper and pencils, but there is no use
meeting till we can have all the conditions." (Power was
needed for dematerialization) . . . "We are happy to have
Mr. Owen here this morning, and we will register Katie's
promise in heaven, in the home of her mother." Mr. and
Mrs. Fox both died in 1865.
(II 50) May 29, 1870. "Katie comes back in no con
dition to work. 'Katie ought to have minded her mother
and not gone with her sister to that place. We hope she
will keep away now. Olin.'
"
(II 69) June 9, 1870. "Katie came Saturday night but
was not able to have a meeting. She had been with a
wealthy family on Fifth Avenue, and was not now herself.
The pencil wrote, 'Curses will follow those people! To give
her drink and keep her over night! I know all! Pity them,
I do not. You had better let them know that you know it.
B. F.'"
(II 150) August 7, 1870. "Katie meets Maggie August
5th, who was fearfully in need of care. She remained with
her and tried to do for her, but the consequence was she went
down under the breakers herself instead of gliding smoothly
over as she had been doing for four weeks and more. The
sea she met in her sister and her sister's surroundings was
too much for her frail bark and she returned to us Saturday
evening, the sixth, sad, sad."
(II 158) August 14, 1870. Katie was away from the
9th to the 14th of August, 1870, and came back "sick in
body and soul."

Katie did not touch the paper on the bureau:
"
'My dear children, We are here with you this morning and
all is well. . . . We had a happy day together. All we
grieved for was to see Katie suffering from an act that only
caused her misery, but God be thanked, she is in the arms of
her friends. Far be it from you, my Son and Daughter, to
condemn the weak and erring whose impulses are like the
rushing waves. There is no apology for sacrifice of principle,
but let none sit self-complacently in judgment upon a human
being when God has made each one to widely differ. Learn
of Him who was meek and lowly of heart, by a frown of dis
pleasure or a cruel word never to break the bruised reed.
Life is formed of trifles and their impenetrable influence will
appear in the great summing up of the Final Judgment. . . .
Farewell. B. F.'

(III 330) August 7, 1871. And this: "Look not coldly
upon Katie at any time. She has much to contend with and
our sympathies go out to her. B. F."
(IIl 322) August 2, 1871. "There is one in the universe,
one whom we wish to be present at the time they (the pic

reasons of our own. This person will be a benefit to you and
we wish to link him with you in this way. When he comes

comes. Oh, how little the world knows her trials; we do and
deeply sympathize with her. Quietly advise her all you can,

(IV 335) June 8, 1 p.m., 1886. "Katie with her two
boys went directly from us on May 29th to visit some English
friends in New Jersey. They returned on the following Mon
day, but I didn't meet her until Tuesday when I noticed she
was unhappy and wished to avoid me. I noticed this, still did
not give her manner the second thought. On Wednesday,
June 2d, the Doctor came over to tell me that Katie was in a
miserable saloon, drunk. He had heard that something was
wrong and had searched her out. She was taken to her rooms
and all the miseries of her old life of ten and fifteen years ago,
were repeated. It appears that these 'English' friends in
duced her to take wine at dinner, and when she once got the
taste all the rest followed. She has been in this city one year
this month and not until now has a drop touched her lips.
We are heartsick, for we know so well her old ways. After
keeping her locked in, she escaping several times, she finally
came to be herself, only excessively nervous."
(II 122) July 15, 1870. "My dear Mrs. Taylor, I want
to express my gratitude to you for your kindness to my child.
Words cannot but deeds can and I will join my prayers with

(IV 30) And at the same seance: "Well done, good and
faithful children, my daughter and son. . . . We bless you,
Bless you for your protection of this poor child who, God
knows, has been more sinned against than sinning." . . .
"My power is exhausted. B. Franklin."
(IV 304) April 20, 1886. Katie was calling with Ferdie,
who had been long and badly sick. B. F. wrote: "He has
been worse than you realize and Mr. Jencken wishes me to
tell the Doctor that he has his soul's everlasting gratitude
with blessings. His boy, he says, has been on his mind, for
he wants him to live and take his place on earth and he has
felt more than anxious. He is here and his heart is full of
love for his dear little family. . . . B. F." (According to
Mrs. Underhill, Ferdie was born September 23, 1873. A
newspaper clipping puts his death at the Sunday before April
22, 1908.)
Wine was the first and the last weakness of Katie. No
shadow of immorality ever touched her.

CHAPTER III
METAPSYCHIC MATERIALISM
(a) The Rationale of Manifestations
By this title (the adjective I borrow from Boirac) I mean
those passages in the Psychic Legacy which have a scientific
or quasi-scientific bearing as lending a clew to the dynamics
and realities of the future life. It will soon be perceived that
the dedication of the term "materialism" by Professor Hyslop
and others to the exclusively mundane life, while it may
stand, provisionally, as conducing to the decision of the main
thesis of eitherâ€”or, survival or no survival, will not do for
investigations into the essential nature of a future life, as
opposed to the terrestrial, since any attempt to view that
life as spiritual only, in the ultimate sense of that term, de
prives it of all content, of all accidents or phenomena. The
term "material" is necessary for the investigator, even should
he conclude for a possible, ultimate future life in the absolute,
devoid of phenomena. The indications which are dropped in
the letters of the Record, apparently at random, constitute
really a well-planned attempt to impart to our minds facts
which are difficult for us to grasp and more difficult to reduce
to standard phraseology. The gateway to knowledge of this
sort will lie through preliminary observations of what spirits
do in handling the matter known to us. From their conduct
towards it we may hope to imagine what their conduct is
towards the para-physical matter, and, in fact, to obtain
some sort of an idea of what that is. We may thus, pari
passu, traverse with them the bridge between the worlds.
But even from this point of view of demonstration of the
bald and immediate fact of survival of personality, whatever

that may consist in or whatever habits and acts such sur
vivors may have and perform, the molar antics of polter
geist are much more reasonable than even spiritualists give
them credit for. For it is only too evident, from ordinary
exhibitions of prejudice as well as from the extraordinary
complacency of such simplistic thinkers as Hudson, that the
straight, plain, unvarnished communications, or automatic
writings, even when the medium writes a mirror hand, if not
more complicatedly, and no matter how consistent and logical
the discourse be, may expect to be met with cold (and wholly
unwarranted) objections about a "subjective" origin, al
though it be necessary, as it were, to draw the whole world
into complicity with the alleged subjectivity. It was Pro
fessor Wallace who shrewdly observed that, without the
physical manifestations or, more exactly, the molar (as op
posed to molecular or quasi-spiritual) phenomena, no one
would ever be convinced of the supernatural origin even of
the most purely psychic symbolism.
Thus it was not without reason (in fact it was for the most
cogent reason), that the household of Mrs. Fish (Underhill)
in Rochester was for months terrorized by vegetables brought
up from the cellar at night and thrown about helter-skelter,
by palings torn from the fence of the neighboring graveyard
and hurled through the window, and by every, possible devil
ish invention of disturbance, or that the long-continued bell-
ringing and throwing about of things at the home of Rev. Mr.
Phelps at Stratford, Connecticut, about the same time, did
not wholly cease, even after the boy most answerable, appar
ently, as a medium, was sent off to boarding school. Pod-
more, determined not to yield to superstition, attributes this
and, in a sweeping way, all other manifestations of polter
geist, to the pranks of naughty boys and girls.

(b) Molar Manifestations
Molar, paraphysical phenomena may be in general taken
as necessary accompaniments, constituents, and certifications
of true metapsychic manifestations.
(I 80) February 4, 1870. "A clear, cold day . . . but
once while the Doctor and Katie were by the door a very
loud noise was heard. I started, thinking something heavy,
I could not fancy what, in the room above us had fallen. The
echoes said at once: 'Dear friends, do not fear, I could not
control the power. B. F.' It seemed to be an explosion of
the power they use. The Doctor said it appeared to strike the
door just above his head, and for the moment stunned him.
My sister afterwards told me that she was sitting by the
window upon the noisy street, there being three rooms and
two closed doors between her and us, and she was startled by
the loud noise and could not see the cause, â€”said it sounded
like the near report of a gun."
(II 50) Again on May 29, 1870: "At one time there was
a loud explosion, apparently on the table in front of us, which
startled us greatly. The echoes said: 'Dear friends, I could
not control the power. B. F.'
"
Only less violent than the accidental explosion of the
spirits' battery was the occasional use to which they put their
power. March 31, 1870. "Great power manifested as soon
as we were seated. The little table was rolled about, the large
table lifted, the Doctor whirled around in his chair, the pen
knife brought from the little table, closed and dropped into
the Doctor's sleeve, the Doctor's and Katie's gowns
1
pulled
vigorously, the Doctor's whiskers pulled repeatedly, etc.
"A pencil was rattled against the legs of the table many
times, then placed in the Doctor's hand and he asked to
sharpen it. He took it into an adjacent room and found it to
be the blue pencil, and that it had been much whittled since

last he saw it. He sharpened and then placed it upon the
little table, where they work. Some little time passed in their
effort to again control the pencil after being touched by
mortal hand. As soon as they succeeded, they signified their
success by rapping it vigorously against the side of the little
table and then threw the linen cloth over my head, entirely
covering it. Immediately they asked to have the window
opened."
December 24, 1870. "Our meeting, apparently, was very
satisfactory. No new thing occurred, except the Doctor com
plained of a pain or fullness in his head which he believed to
be occasioned by want of sleep. Almost immediately two
large, firm hands were laid upon the sides of his head and
pressed long and strong upon it. Dr. Franklin said that he
was trying to give him relief."
(Ill 1 06) December 22, 1 870. "At all of the sittings for
this picture the circle has signified its wish for the Doctor and
Katie to go by the folding doors by giving the Doctor a
gentle push, when he would say: 'Come, Katie.' She re
peatedly, during the first days of their being directed in this
way, answered him after this manner: 'Why! how do you
know they want us?' It was so strange to her for the spirits
to signify their wishes and she know nothing about it. When
the invisible circle wished them to take their seats, the Doctor
would be gently but firmly pulled in that direction." Psychic
power is the familiarity of old acquaintance.
One of the most effective performances at seances is the
bringing of objects from a distance, often apparently from
outside the house. For instance:
(I 129) April 9, 1870. Along with other playful tricks
by the children, "I heard a little noise near me and soon felt
something at my lips. On taking it in my hand found it was

could not tell what they were until after the meeting, when

tell. There were no flowers in the room on this afternoon,
nor were there any in the house, excepting three or four
perfectly fresh in another room, and none of these was miss
ing. There was but one rosebud when they were given to me
and that one was still in the vase. There were many im
mortelles in the drawer of my bureau, but that was closed."
It was a pretty good apport anyhow, even if not from outside.
The weight of evidence is that it was from outside.
(II 185) The following was perhaps more convincing.
September 18, 1870. "As soon as we entered the room, Isaac
T. Hopper said through the echoes: 'My dear son, I have
brought you a leaf from my bibleâ€”a leaf from my grave,
I call it my bibleâ€”a mark. I have kept it long in my pres
ence. Get mucilage.' . . . After the sitting, they found,â€”
"upon the table, at which we had been sitting, stood the small
round table or stand, and upon it was a piece of cardboard
eighteen inches long and six inches wide. Upon this card
board was an oak leaf pasted and above it was written in a
clear hand, 'For one over whom I have a care. Isaac T.
Hopper.' . . . the oak leaf we had never seen before."
(III 264) Mr. Hopper was decidedly in the business of
apports. On June 1, 1871, "We found upon the bureau a
beautiful white daisy with its root in soil four inches deep.
It had twelve blossoms and more buds and weighed with the
soil exactly one pound. This was Mr. Hopper's present and
what he brought in when the window was opened for him. It
is very beautiful and we shall try hard to keep it in life and
health. The following is what they wrote through Katie's
handâ€”'We are all here. Keep the flowers in memory of this
night. I hope they will live. God bless you. Isaac T.
Hopper.'

each of the earlier seances into a logical whole was the sus

these I still possess, sixty-two years after. They have always
hung on my wall and have attracted no comment, good or
bad. For me, they have been the eikons of my private re
ligion. However, their elaboration was a slow and almost
painful process, and involved the fundamental principles of
spiritual technology. The paper was never touched, except
on a few occasions, to put it in the drawer, where it was
locked. It was handled with a gauze over it. But frequently
the paper and pencils were taken out of the window, the Lord
knows where, and sometimes kept for days, and the pencils
even for weeks, before they were returned. I shall try to
make some extracts from the Record to illustrate this process.
Anyhow, materialization and, especially, dematerialization
play a large part.
(I 105) February 14, 1870. This is the seance that was
held when Katie was dead drunk. "We turned off the light
and sat down by the table. I think it could not have been
one minute before the Doctor and Katie were sent by the
door. He as before took her in his arms and the echoes im
mediately said, 'Open window.' I threw the sash wide open,
put my hand out, and felt the rain still falling, though not
thick and heavy. I wondered and said, 'What can they
want ? The rain would spoil the paper even if they could take
it in such an atmosphere.' By the time I had finished my
comments the echoes said, 'We have taken the paper. Prof.
Hare aided us. Get light.' We lighted the gas and looked in
the bureau drawer and there lay Frankie's picture (which
was finished and duly presented) on the cover of the box and
nothing in the box. Not only was the paper gone, but the
linen cloth that was folded about it was gone also. Drunken
ness like dying releases evangelical power.
"The pencil then wrote while Willie was standing by the
bureau looking at Frankie's picture: 'We have taken paper
and will give a perfect likeness. Our robes sheltered the
paper. Poor Katie! have great patience with her, for when

was near the threshold of eternity.2 . . . The Circle.'

(I 191) April 11, 1870. Again: "My dear Sarah, while
they are gathering I will speak to you a few words. All the
circle are now approaching the room with paper and pencils."
(Ill 313) July 23, 1871. "Our bell has sounded. Yes,
sounded for our presence. Some one needs us and we must
go. Call us not back. We take the paper to the palace.
B. F."
(I 125) February 28, 1870. "We fear to bring the pic
ture in this atmosphere."
(I 126) "Were we to bring the picture in its magnetized
state through the dampness, part of its beauty would be
lost. B. F."
(II 115) "It is almost impossible for us to come in the
heated atmosphere (July 11, 1870). We find it next to
impossibility. Therefore, we are happy to come when we
have not these drawbacks. The disturbance caused us a little
uneasiness. We saw her coming and had to make the paper
invisible." (Cf. section on dematerialization (e) below.)
(Ill 161) February 9, 1871. "The atmosphere prevents
us from coming very near."
(Ill 179) June 18, 1871. "I find that we lose power
when we attempt to come in an atmosphere like this, and
also injure our fine spiritual organization. We will never
make the effort again. B. F."
(II 10) April 29, 1870. "We wondered how they could
bring it (the paper) through the wet atmosphere. . . . 'We
shielded the picture with a thicker paper.'
"
(II 16) April 30, 1870. "We had been but a minute or
two in our places when a white pink, from a vase upon the

upon the table, and one of them was slipped into the Doctor's

Presentation of Leila's picture followed.
(II 103) July 7, 1870. "The afternoon was damp and
warm. We met as directed. Soon after we were seated I
noticed the sound of heavy rain and remarked, 'Can that be
rain ?' The Doctor replied 'Yes/ and the echoes added, 'And
our paper is here.' On our asking if they were anxious in con
sequence, they said, 'Yes.' In a few moments they decided
what to do and said, 'If the rain continues, open the lower
drawer of the bureau.' After about fifteen minutes' sitting,
the rain still falling, they said. 'Open the drawer.' As soon
as that was prepared, the Doctor and Katie were sent by
the folding doors, and when they returned and stood near the
bureau, we heard the paper placed in the drawer and the
drawer pushed in quickly. Katie's hands were held, as al
ways, by the Doctor, she standing by his side. Then they
wished the window opened, so they could take the pencils
with them."
The positiveness of the work in hand was certified at every
seance by the pranks of Frankie and Leila. Their unequivo
cal personalities probably spoke louder and brought to the
parents more consolation than the messages or pictures. The
latter, however, were the magnum opus, the miracle of
miracles.

pocket of S. E. L. T.'s dress.

This occurred in the front parlor brightly lit up with gas.
The table was an old-fashioned, marble-top table of the
period.

much larger and the touch was not like hers. The hand was
warm and firm and perfectly natural in its feeling. I had no

(IV 156) December 11,11 p.m., 1885. "While the above
was being written, we extinguished all light, and soon there
after the midnight bells of the city struck and, at the same
time, a sweet, clear bell began to ring in our midst and close
to us. It rang with the greatest regularity and sounded more
like the silver bells in a music box than any other sound I
know. It had rung several minutes, I should think five, when
Frankie said, 'Brother Willie, look at my bell.' Then it rang
clear and strong in front of and close by Willie but he could
not see it. Neither of us could see anything but the blackness
of darkness. Finally, the bell began to move away appar
ently. The sound lessened gradually until we could hear but
the faintest ring and as though it was far away, then ceased
entirely."
"The manifestation was beautiful but no surprise to us
because of our previous experiences as before recorded. I
know absolutely that neither Katie nor we have a bell or any
other thing that could be made'to give forth what we heard."
(IV 66) June 6, 1875. . . . "The paper was returned
covered on each side with pencil writing and signed by all the
circle. This you will observe is the first autograph letter from
the circle since Katie's return. ... In this letter of June 6th
the handwriting changes several times. Dr. Franklin's, Ma's,
and Olin's are marked and then there seems to be an inde
scribable mixing of the hands with places where it is like
Em's and like Uncle Albert's and like Isaac T. Hopper's."

readily noticed.
The topic of Leila's harp is deferred until that of material
ization is reached.
(c) Coming in Form
(IV 381) June 6, 1890. "My dear children: We are
here, all of the circle, to speak with you and listen to your
voices. How near we are to you now! What a pleasure to
us ! There are times when we cannot see you so clearly, then
we wish for this connecting link. We look into your eyes and
hear your voices, and, when the light is dim, we can touch
you. . . . Benj. Franklin."
The dynamics of physical manifestations evidently leads
over to the subject of materialization, as we clearly infer from
Frankie's bell. But, on the way, we encounter a halfway
stage, illustrated hitherto only by the personal, bodily, we
might say, somatic metamorphosis, known as "coming in
form." Whether spiritual, inanimate objects, such as a spirit
ual bell or a spiritual harp, may be arrested at this halfway
stage of materialization, is not yet apparent, but analogy
would claim that it may be. Apparently any and all ap
proach of a spirit to earth involves a "coming in form" of
high or low degree. The first reference below seems to con
tradict this last statement; but to my mind it merely fails to
distinguish a slight degree of materialization from no for
mation.
(1147) March 12, 1870. "The children are here but not
in form."
(I 151) March 14, 1870. "Little Leila is here in form;
but if we use our power in making her visible to your eyes,

(XI 92) June 26, 1870. Very hot morning, six a.m.
"The atmosphere will not permit us to hold our forms long
this morning. Therefore we will not be able to remain long.
The picture is here, but we must get it away as soon as pos
sible."
(Ill 143) January 25, 1871. Spirits form apparently in
order to sense what is being done in form, i.e., in earthly
intercourse and business. Leila must be materialized as well
as the harp. And, in order to get Leila's expression suitable
for earthly presentation, she must pose "in form," and yet
not visible to human eye.
(Ill 9) September 29, 1870.
"
'Dear children, remember
we are trying to take the form you can behold. Now your
friend the Professor is in form but not a pleasing one to your
eyes, therefore we are obliged to form with care. These are
important meetings for preparation. B. F.' Very soon after,
the Professor said, 'George, here I am in form. Do you hear
my feet? I will bring a familiar token at our next meeting.'
And we did hear his feet. He walked about with the same
positive step as when in the flesh."

invisible, how to come ourselves, and we watch with interest

behold during these preparations, and were you to open your
eyes upon us it would affect us very painfully. This may
seem strange to you, but it is nevertheless true."
(Ill 154) February 5, 1871. . . . "The echoes asked to
have the windows opened. We knew by the movements that
they were not through with us and we could not see why they
wished the window opened. Olin explained. 'Dr. Franklin is
going now.' The window was opened and closed in less than
a minute and the writing again commenced. When they
were through, we again opened the window and stood by it
until they had all passed out. When they are in form, as
now, it usually takes the circle about five minutes to pass out
of the room. At each of these last three meetings, we have
been particularly conscious of the presence of many indi
viduals."
(Ill 6) September 27, 1870. "The morning Frankie was
about leaving the form, I with your own Ma and Olin stood
by your side and oh ! how we tried to cheer you, to lift the
heavy weight, the despair. Then, Sarah, the way was not
open for our souls to touch yours with peace, with that peace
which God gives to His Angels for the mourner to partake of.
Then when Leila flew away, I was near. Others came and
talked with you, but I knew not the way. I have since be
come as familiar with the telegraphing as the circle who daily
come to you with their perceptible forms. . . . Grandma."
(My italics.) In this selection, "leaving the form" is first
used for "leaving the body." In its second use, "perceptible
form" is an ingenuous expression for "formed sufficiently for
the spirits to see each other." It does not mean that Grandma
was visible in the ordinary sense. Grandma is speaking from
her own point of view.

this day, as the power has been exhausted on the pictures.
They are forming now to present them. Dr. Franklin is
gathering the materials. I must close. Your own Ma."
Evidently, the last word of appearing in form is that the
form be so materialized as to bear inspection as a real,
earthly person. For this purpose material must be gathered,
from living persons, perhaps, as shown by the work of Bisson.

(I 114) February 23, 1870. . . . "The echoes said, 'Dear
mamma, would you like to catch a little glimpse of me?' . . .
We looked and saw a beautiful light on the middle of the bed.
. . . The echoes then said, 'We showed you this to quiet you.'
. . . the echoes said, 'Open your eyes.' And there on the
table almost under my face was the beautiful light again."
The Doctor says: "On being told to look I opened my eyes
and saw near the middle of the table, what appeared an oval,
luminous body, of about the size of the upper half of a per
son's head of medium size," etc., etc.

'Remember, she is but a little child,' meaning that she was
too little to understand that I could not help her. Then I
asked Olin to help her, to bring her and set her on my lap.
Only an instant at a time, but repeated with varying degrees
of weight many times, only once was she heavy as a child of
four years would naturally be. Olin told me to lean my face
over toward my shoulder. I did. Then she seemed to stand
or kneel upon my lap, lay her head upon my shoulder and
her face against my face. She did this three times. The
first and second there seemed to be a fabric of some sort
between her face and mine, but the pressure was firm and
slightly prolonged. The third time there was nothing inter
vening, and the touch was exactly like the flesh of a child's
face, warm, soft, and life like."
(Ill 149) February 3, 1871. "The Doctor and Katie
were sent by the folding doors when Frankie said, 'Papa,
open your eyes and see my shadow.' The Doctor obeyed and
Katie opened hers also and they both saw the dim shadow of
a child â€”the head and form upon the wall. Frankie had
turned the slats so that sufficient moonlight to make a shadow
was admitted.
"Then the Doctor and Katie were told to close their eyes
and in less than one minute a head of soft, loose hair was
pressed against and brushed across my forehead and face. I
asked whose it was. Frankie answered, 'It was my head and
hair you felt, mamma.' They soon left but required both
windows opened wide for them to pass out."
(I 216) April 22, 1870. "As my hand lay upon the table
I noticed something brush across the ends of my fingers that
felt like cloth of some fine sort. I felt it again and mentioned
it. The Doctor soon noticed something of the same kind pass
over and cling to his shoulder. The fabric seemed to be de
tained or held by the roughness of his coat. The echoes said
that each time it was Leila and her dress we felt."

(the children) are doing now? I will tell you: learning the
way to approach you in visible form with ease and patience,
with quiet and firmness, for their great joy, their impatient
desire to get in your arms would so destroy the conditions
that they would not be able to retain their forms. You too
must be calm and let them imbibe your feelings. This you
can do if you try. . . . Olin."
(II 53) May 31, 1870. "The Doctor and Katie were
sent by the folding doors two or three times and finally,
after a half hour, were told to open the window. As they
approached it from the folding doors, they felt and heard the
paper, and when near the window they were distinctly con
scious of a third person standing with them (who) got be
tween them once and pushed the blinds together after the
paper and pencils had passed out. The Doctor said it seemed
exactly as though I were in my place." (S. E. L. T. was ill
and in bed in the same room.)
(II 59) June 3, 1870. . . . "and the Doctor feeling from
time to time the hand of the Professor; sometimes it is a slap
upon the shoulder, sometimes a clasp about the wrist, at
other times a sudden and firm grasp of his leg when sitting,
and again the hold is gentle but still firm."
The pranks of the children would fill a book.
The most remarkable materialization was not that of a per
son but of a thing; not of Leila but of her harp. When at
first we are convinced of the reality, the veridicity, of ma
terialization, we are thinking of spirits. It is a higher degree
of initiation to believe in inanimate things originating in
heaven and then hypostatized on earth. There be other
things in heaven than purely Platonic ideas. On the other
hand, we may imagine that the harp, in its proper quality as
heavenly, was quite ideal in its perfection, and that it suffered

ings will be short as we cannot retain the harp long in your
atmosphere, and their purpose will be to materialize the
harp."
(IIl 125) January 8, 1871. They "have to wait till we
can get control of the instrument and materialize it suffi
ciently to play notes that you can understand."
(IIl 133) January 15, 1871. Leila was held in Dr.
Franklin's arms to play her harp. Doctor Taylor says:
"When we first heard the harp it appeared to be near but
behind us and remained there until Leila said, 'I will play
alone,' when it was brought very near our heads and played
not more than one foot from my ears."
"These musical sounds resembled mostly those of a first-
class music box, yet were different. They penetrated the
organ of sense more than any music I ever heard, however
loud. They gave a feeling of the most supreme delight that
can, apparently, be produced by musical sounds. They had
not the regularity of music produced by machinery."
(IIl 135) January 17, 1871. "Again we come with the
harp but you cannot hear its heavenly strains today. We
must bring it twice more before it is sufficiently materialized
to sound. It is the most delicate instrument in our world and
we have to handle it with great care. You will notice that we
have to meet for preparation always two or three times before
we play upon it. Leila is learning a new hymn to play at the
next meeting. When the time comes right, we shall meet for
the purpose of coming in form with Leila holding her harp;
and if you are full of faith, you shall not be disappointed.
One doubt will keep us from succeeding, â€”one doubt will chill
us and keep us from forming. This will take time and pa

hall and met ali our friends: those who are bound to us by
close ties and those whose friendships have outlived mor
tality. We all assembled in a room by ourselves, and Dr.
Franklin related to listening ears the fact of his bringing
Leila in your presence with her harp, how she played while
he held her in his arms, and how heavenly the strains fell on
your ears. All who were permitted to hear were pleased and
gratified and some were astonished, but all were made happy.

(IIl 147) February 1, 1871. . . . "We were not kept in
suspense for as soon as Dr. Franklin ceased speaking we
heard a clear, full sound from Leila's harp. We started, for
we had not expected
it,
but we sang the Lord's prayer
through once and the harp accompanied us. Then we kept
perfectly still, held both of Katie's hands, and listened in
rapture for about three-quarters of an hour.

The notes
were clear, full, strong and penetrating. The music sweeter
than anything

had ever heard. Ten pieces were played, and
one was long, and none was familiar. At an interval between
the lines, Dr. Franklin said,
'I
am proud of my pupil.' Then
she struck the strings again and with full power played and
played. At the close of the next to the last tune, Frankie
said,
'I
help Leila.' Then the harp was brought so near me
that when the first note was touched
it
hurt my head, and
again she played, stronger, sweeter, purer than before.

heard with distinctness the touch of the fingers upon the
strings. . . ."
(Ill 267) June 7, 1871. "On opening the door I heard
one clear, ringing note from an instrument, but without
noticing it I spoke with Katie and while doing so heard

(e) Dematerialiiation
In the dictionary of psychodynamism, "materialization"
and "dematerialization" are nominally complementary, but,
only provisionally separate processes, hardly as distinct as
the production and consumption of electricity. In both
cases, each phenomenon is the evidence of what is really one
process of spiritual or electrical transformism.
Here the parallel stops. For the electrical transformation
is a simple, mechanical process, in which man attends to
most of the details, relying simply upon God to continue to
furnish the raw force which has been systematically isolated
and named "electricity"; whereas, in the other case, a spirit
(carnate perhaps, but generally discarnate) exerts his will,
amounting to prayer, and God thereupon makes all the in
finite adjustments that go to preserve a personality, to save
it out of a lower environment over into a higher or to permit
it to descend from a higher to a lower. The distinction is
that between the inorganic (electricity) and the organic (life,
personality). The working of an automobile produces an
effect of science; a materialization is an effect of faith.

to us, in their rigid, hieroglyphic way, the spatial idea in
volved in the course which God pursues, in this case. They
say, for instance, that a being living in two-dimensional space
would only have one or two dimensions. That is to say,
to our apprehension, it would be nothing at all, only a point
or, at most, a vacant lot to build upon. Assume, however,
a world of three dimensions,â€”what unlimited possibilities
are spread out! The known universe, man, and all plants
and animals are donated by God the instant our thought
rises to the conception of and desire for cubical life. The
algebraic exponent of the third degree typifies mathematically
this stage of evolution, the cubic.
Further, suppose we take notice that a quadratic exponent
is also formally possible. Our curiosity is aroused. We want
to know whether that is merely a new though empty form,
or whether God has hypostatized it as He has the binomial
of the third degree. The potentialities of this thought are
dazzling, when we reflect what infinite difference is subtended
by the inceptive, second step from the square to the cube.
Remember that the being endowed with third degree qualities
makes a parade ground of the second degree; he prome
nades up and down upon it. By analogy, the man of quad
ratic endowment must, in a sense, walk over us. He looks on
us as a sort of Flatland. Geometricians would represent
this quadratic conception of space by a nest of cubes more
or less interlocking. In other words, the quadratic person
ality can transpose himself by a mere (well, a pretty definite,
positive) thought into a great many different environments
without taking a step, as it would look to us.
We have to travel to Melbourne with labor and expense,
because we happen to be only of third degree. A spirit can
get there at once, because, for him, Melbourne is here, when
he wills it. This may not seem entirely satisfactory, â€” I am
simply trying, in the relations of the third and fourth de
grees of the exponent, to drive home the parallel that all

know to exist between the second and third degrees. The
cannon of St. Gobain could reach Paris with its projectile
because it could utilize the third dimension for a high trajec
tory. And so Puck can be here, there, and everywhere at
once, because he utilizes a still further degree of spatial
potentiality. If a being works in Space, it is Space that
works for the being, the individual soul. To will is essen
tially to command the spatial elements apt to a degree or
exponent. What we do is very much what Space does for
us. Erstwhile it was Chance that wielded the scepter of
Jove. Today Space bids fair to usurp the throne of Olym
pus, having banished Chance.
The elementary parallel we sense with clearness, because
we already are securely entrenched in the superior stage of
the evolution envisaged up to the third degree. We strain
at the parallel of the third and fourth degrees, because,
in this case, we occupy the inferior position. Our expe
rience has not yet enforced the relation. A "miracle" alone
can enforce it. The deep sea dredge affords us a richer idea
of the ocean than a fish can ever obtain of the land. The
only way a man can get an idea of heaven is to represent
it in earthly terminology, and if we use the parallel of al
gebraic notation, it is only to enable us to surmise that it is
wholly reasonable that there do exist a quadratic estate; and
that it must surpass infinitely, in its possibilities, the cubic.
In its way, Spiritualism succeeds in "unscrewing the inscru
table."
It were evidently lost labor to toy with the notion of fifth
and higher degrees. Man has as yet encountered no limit
to the universe; only to his sense of it.
The commonest process of dematerialization is death.

ground while you are inhaling its perfume, but the soul of
the rose lives forever. It passes into another rose of its
kindred â€”another and another. Nothing is lost."
The rose-soul would be a near Platonic idea. The soul
wanders in the third dimension, passing, like the bee, from
rose to rose; but depends upon a will to blossom which is
quite other-worldly in origin. On the other hand, the
miracles of the pictures (of the paper and crayons) â€”which
traverse the sittings of twenty-two years, are effected through
the separate principle of dematerialization (which must lose
the "de-," from the fourth dimension point of view. What
we call "dematerialization," the spirit must call, "materiali
zation").
(I 92) February 11, 1870. "We have done the best we
could under the conditions. Have the picture framed and
photographed. A glass over it will make it look finer. You
must remember that the little boy has grown here and al
though we cannot give his beauty on paper, we have shown
you our power. We will take one of the little girl. To
work with earthly materials it is impossible to give the fine
spiritual expression. We can make earthly objects so mag
netized that we can make them invisible to the earthly eye."
To magnetize, then, is pro tanto, to dematerialize.
(I 94) February 12, 1870. "We will meet you here at
half past eight on Monday to magnetize the paper."
(I 137) March 6, 1870. "You are becoming daily more
spiritual in your knowledge of heaven, that home where your
loved ones dwell; and often your spiritual form walks here
with us, while you sleep and dream." That means, perhaps,
that we each have a spiritual form that does not need mag
netizing in order to become quadratic. Its performances
frequently leave no record on the man's earthly recollection.
The last two excerpts are perhaps complementary. Other
wise they would be dubious; for when an article is mag
netized to invisibility, is it still "here" or already "there"?

(I 225) April 23, 1870. "We have been working above
on the picture this morning. It has not been in the room,
but this afternoon have room all ready and window open
at half past four. We had to work on the picture in our
own homes this morning. Therefore, we were silent. B. F."
This extract is typical of the twenty-two years' experience.
(Ill 19) October 7, 1870. . . . "Directly after we were
seated the Doctor and Katie each felt the paper placed for
a moment on their heads, then the echoes said, 'Dear Sarah,
we leave it in your charge.' At the same time the precious
paper that had been carried from Earth to Heaven many,
many times . . . and as often returned to our room . . .
this paper was placed in my hands."
(Ill 254) May 28, 1871. "When we opened our eyes I
first looked for the paper which I had placed upon the little
table when I prepared the room, and which I had placed
there before nearly every meeting for months, and this same
paper had been, at the close of each meeting, either brought
and placed in my hands for me to put in the box or they
had put it in the box themselves and then brought both to
me. But now they had not brought either paper or box,
only the cloth. I looked faithfully for the paper, but it was
not in the room. We read: 'My dear Sarah and George.
We are all here. We have a clear atmosphere, and good
conditions. The paper is prepared and we will take it with
us and do our work as soon as possible. It has been diffi

up when this picture is finished. We shall invent some colors

one which appears shortest in the third.
The ubiquitousness of spirits speaks loudly of the char
acteristic difference between environments which we have
been discussing. Katie died long before the experiments
of the London S. P. R. in the cross-correspondences of Mrs.
Verrall and Mrs. Holland, the earliest of which "began
towards the end of 1903."

The Doctor (G. H. T.) started on a business trip to
Michigan before 6 p.m., July 12, 1870. On July 15, 2 p.m.,
this came from Olin: . . . "first he (George) was disap
pointed in not meeting the party he wished to, but all seems
to go smoothly now. I can say no more about him till
tomorrow at half past nine, as he will not do much before
then. George is writing now. You will hear today."
"When the Doctor returned, the next week, and told this
day's experience, it corresponded exactly with Olin's state
ment, save that the appointment with the lawyer was for
the next morning instead of evening." But the message
said nothing about "evening." Did Olin follow George;
or George, Olin? From Olin's point of view, did he simply
keep George with him, watching what he was about?

to check this up; but the following is a good test:

about two-thirds through she says that Olin has come and
wants to write as soon as she is through.
"Olin's letter is perfectly intelligible, referring to matters
purely personal and that no person in America, besides the
parties interested, knows anything about, much less could
Katie or anybody in London know. He could not possibly
have known of matters to which he refers if he had not
been near enough to know what we are doing and saying and
to read the letters we receive.

'My dear Sarah: I am so happy to come here in Katie's
little parlor and give you a few words. I have been with
you, Sarah, every day, and given you assurances of my
continued presence. I have just left you now to say these
few words. Be not troubled, you will come out fair and all
your trials will pass into blessings. George must not look
on the dark side. He will realize blessings soon from that
source. Tell him he can do nothing at present but wait.
Yes, Sarah, do as you are contemplating and all will be

"We all like the little lady's name. It is not strange at
all that Dr. Franklin has not sent you a message. He has
been with you aiding you and I often speak for him. His
interest in you and George has not even flagged. Sarah,
do not feel depressed; your health will soon be established
and your children will bless you. Two on earth and two
in heaven. How happy you ought to be! Never sigh for
Frankie or Leila. They often play with baby and make her

must be patient. Bradley is often with you. He will never
cease to lend his aid to you. Oh! how we love the new
house. I will soon be talking with you through Katy. I
now go to you. Olin."
Some of the topics of this letter might have been suggested
to Katie in letters from S. E. L. T. (there is no evidence
that there were any), but others were too recent. Flora
was born in August preceding. But the remarks about
Dr. Franklin, to which Olin replies, were made in New York
about the time Olin's letter was written in London. Bradley
died in the preceding December, but Em had only just
come to the Movement Cure for her health, and subse
quently, in the middle of November, died there of con
sumption. The new sanatorium (Hotel Branting) had been
occupied May 1st, and it is improbable that Mrs. Taylor
had already written to Katie about it.
The next communication was of December 30, 1873, and
recounts Em's experiences in dying and further contains a
beautiful note from Frankie, who is delighted with Flora,
but thinks he likes Leila a little better.

(/) Power
The molar manifestations and demonstrations instanced
under (a) supra were undoubtedly powerful; but the power
was materialized and earthly. Indeed, the Record's use of
the term always has reference to some terrestrial manifesta
tion ; but the power used is not always from the medium nor
even utilized out of earth's economy, for "they" distinctly
speak of gathering power in their own homes. By and
large, the relation of mind and personal will to molar effects,
in the spirit intercourse, seems to resemble the balance of
power in modern international politics, or again in the "hold
ing corporations" familiar to finance, where it is sufficient to
control a small balance of shares in order to dictate the policy
of the affiliated corporations. What I mean is that the psy
chological element of a society is organized to set the
mightiest engines at work; and so when we try to account
for and to form some idea of the life of a "disembodied
spirit," we must bear in mind this peculiar nature of the
control of mind over matter. The balance of power remains
with the spirit. The idea of power lies so closely to that of
spirit that it is only natural to say: "Sunshine from your
souls gives power" (II 101). Happiness (IV 16) and faith
(IV 47) are forces in heaven. "Power" is often used in the
messages.

Spirit intercourse depends upon the building up of a para-
physical structure of some sort, perhaps through an unison
of individual volitions, harmoniously marching in a definite
direction. So long as this machine is intact, the spiritual
movement proceeds, gathering force as it goes. But it is
easily put out of gear, when the analogy of the "broken
chain" is applied, as it has been constantly since the events of
1848.
(II 82) June 21, 1870. "We have had to keep up the
chain by our constant meetings, but now it is as strong as
ever, and we rejoice."
(II 169) August 28, 1870. "I am happy to come to you
although the chain is weakened by giving out power for
physical uses. Your Ma." It thus appears that it is the
same power that is used for the writing and for the pictures
and other manifestations.
(III 222) May 3, 1871. "The atmosphere is not clear
but we are in your presence and happy to add new links
to the broken chain. Sarah, we are watching your thoughts.
They are many and shadows of anxiety seem to throw a
little gloom over you. Olin." Apparently anxiety breaks
the chain.
(II 183) September 16, 1870. "I was detained an hour.
The delay rendered the writing difficult. We have been
waiting long. We have held the power as well as we could,
but now we must work, not write much."
(IIl 95) December 15, 1870. "We are one circle, and
our power is expended alike. We never want our power ex
hausted during these meetings, therefore it is well to call on
us as little as possible while we retain the paper and crayons.

After all. Sister Em was a beloved guest.
Frequent returns to the old home in Western New York inter
rupted the perfect faith that qualified to join the inner circle.

Laboratory methods are highly utilitarian. Love and re

the heavenly light shines through the natural eye, it is then
the spiritual sees things in their heavenly light." Olin died

(IIl 162) February 9, 1871. "You see your world, but

I turn aside from the description and feel that no pen can

here. One great happiness, Sarah, you will never feel strange

(IIl 168) February 22, 1871. "So you thought, Sarah,

CHAPTER IV
SPIRITUAL BODIES
(a) The Bodily Forms
A terrestrial machine, while constituted inwardly of
more or less unsightly devices for the absorption, trans
formation, and expression or exertion of power, is generally
enveloped by a casing or skin which, in a general way,
determines its frontiers. Within the case it is conceded
complete dominion. The case serves chiefly to hold aloof
intruders, and thus to secure normal operation. Our human,
mechanical devices imitate nature in this respect. However
unequal are the speed of a tortoise and an automobile, there
is a close resemblance in the duty of the shell of the one
to that of the hood of the other. The carapace or covering
of a machine, taken in this broad sense, offers a favorite
field to the aesthetic motive. Esthetics does not look behind
the blush of the rose to discover an aniline dye, nor traverse
the sleek robe of a charger to gloat on his fifty-odd feet of
intestine.
We may venture even the generalization that the primary
utility of the shell is less that of protection than of beauty.
Without outsides to things, they are hideous. What tourist
in hot weather would imitate the errand boy by exposing
the engine of his Ford merely for sake of cooling it? The
engine itself, however, is still further inside. There are two
wrappers in this case. Living organisms also have several.
(IV 201) February 8, 1886. "The transition from the
earthly form to the spiritual is beautiful and to you incom
prehensible. When the body is being prepared for burial
and clothed for the grave, the spirit is being clothed in im

mortal garments and resting on a bed of roses, unconscious
of the grief on earth, for some hours. When the spirit
becomes perfectly awake, it seems like awakening from a
dream, but there are those who stand by to make all things
clear. They linger around the new-born spirit and show so
many beautiful things that the grief of those on earth does
not reach here till they are able to understand that there is a
way to return to the mourner and a way to comfort. The
birth of spirits here has to be studied carefully. Every
birth is different according to the life on earth. An infant's
birth is very beautiful, though (it is) most painful to witness
the grief of a parent at parting with the child. Prof. K.,
Olin and the Circle."
In the third dimension, gainful, competitive, bread-win
ning occupations drive out or befog or preclude spiritual
consciousness, which is essentially a consciousness of the
immanence of the Divine. Of course, there is a life partner
ship between these qualities, but the terrestrial raise a smoke
screen before the heavenly. This is a fact and not to be
deplored, otherwise the economy of the dimension would
suffer detriment. In no connection does the necessity of the
idea, if not of the reality, of God emerge with equal force
with that manifested in the translation of the dying to the
fourth dimension. It is fair to say that a human "social
science" complacently imagines that it occupies itself solely
with human activities, to the exclusion of the divine. The
work of the "laboratory," in the ambitious or pretentious
sense in which that word has been banalized by every fledg
ling of knowledge, is "the work of man." If nature ventures
anything worth remarking, we are told that the specific speci
mens, reagents, materials, animals, races, species, nations,
tribes, societies, cities, sects, men act for themselves. They
act as they do because they do. Thus science ends as it began
â€”with taxonomy.

personal basis of accounting for man. Because, for example,
it has discovered a specific, secular radiation from a highly
charged or concentrated mineral appropriately named,
"radium," it stops with that (in scientific theory, at least).
Science may take a further grudging step, in order to point
out the utility of radium; it wholly ignores the moral sequela
from radium. Deeper into human interests science does not
delve. The question at issue is not one of logic but of choice,
of predilection. One consequence is that science becomes
too familiar with the universe and too cocksure of the laws
which it substitutes for Deity. It is true that individual
scientists have here and there registered their moods of self-
surrender and adoration, but the trend and the pressure
upon followers and the public are materialistic. True ex
planation has ever a sympathetic, sentimental association
and connotation, in spite of the contrary claim. Assent is
a personal matter. Our superficiality of apprehension of
nature will persist until we surrender totally our delusion
of a man-made world, and of every thing, industry, fabrica
tion, business, ideas and ideals, as man-made, for we must
give the same sympathetic assent to these events which are
admittedly not man-made.
The antithetical conception is the essentially religious one
of God-made. Why quarrel with it? Why waste words des
canting about the laws of nature, while denying God? What
skeptics should mean is that their youthful ideas of God, or
that popular ideas of God, were or are inadequate. If, how
ever, you have made room for a scheme of knowledge in
your head, does that exclude the need of belief in a Final
Cause of that which you know and deeply feel as well as of
that which you do not? Having that belief, why should you
perpetually put it in the background; and shove your inconse
quential selves in front, while denying that you do so? Earth,
like other Kindergartens, exaggerates the future unimportant.

utility are direct, almost absolutely direct. The peculiarity
of third dimension is the famous "roundabout process." It
misleads us about our essential dependence on nature and
God who only work through environment, primitive force, .
ultimate vibrations, and the like.
It is no petty, personal undertaker of burials who spreads
a bed of roses for the spiritual body of the spiritual new-born.
But this obverse complement of the earthly funeral rite is
performed directly and with infinite beauty. Our clergy
must recognize that Katie is their powerful ally, â€”frail Katie.
The bed of roses is built by law but it is still the blossoming
of the desires of angels. Is not here a process as totally
natural as the blossoming of third dimension roses in re
sponse to a wish, roundabout expressed by planting and
laboring the soil ? And so on of our clothes, our transporta
tion, and most manifestly of our domestic animals, and chief-
est of all, of our children? Without the children the scheme
of God were incomprehensible. Are children man-made?
Alone he who can cheerfully negative the proposition is on
the road to spiritual life. And there is here no implication
of any necessary doctrine of reincarnation. The simple ques

weary. W. H. V." This sentiment could with difficulty be
applied to the traditional, clanking, graveyard ghost.
The inquiry into the corporealness of spirits, whether their
bodies be material or mental, is a question of importance, but
also somewhat beside the mark, especially when unduly em
phasized. We may well imagine that a psychic existence
should call less on thews and sinews than an earthly. And
yet, even in this terrestrial environment, the relatively psy
chic animal, homo erectus or sapiens, is extremely feeble com
pared with the larger apes, and with the other abler of the
animals. Man admittedly rules them by wit and cunning.
Further, the quadratic or fourth dimensional qualification
of the future life teaches that our idea of space must be radi
cally modified in order to fit that life. Some writers, like
Bergson, confine the strict idea of space to terrestrial or as
tronomical conditions and environment. The future life
would be, thus, purely mental. Our evidence, however,
would teach that this is going too far. The fourth dimen
sional idea does not absolutely exclude the idea of space.
For the second dimension also comported space. Moreover,
we do not need to suppose that the transition is ideally, per
fectly, complete. The future life, as it is becoming accessible
to us, need not be regarded as a radical volte face out of the
third. More likely than not, it partakes of the nature of
both systems, and perhaps neither is anywhere ideally re
alized. Plato soared high for his ideas.
In "Origin of Species," Darwin states that there is no
definite frontier to a species, but that, on the contrary, there
is an imperceptible shading-off from one to another, and
that the neutral territory, inconsistent as the expression may
seem, though not a "no man's land," is precisely where the
battle for survival rages fiercest. The belief in Purgatory
is frankly evolutionary. At this point, various clews might
be sensed and followed up as to a possible weeding out of
souls in the period immediately following death, some be

Again, in "Descent of Man," 274, Darwin said: "I believe in
no fixed law of development, causing all the inhabitants of
a country to change abruptly, or simultaneously, or in an
equal degree."

We may accept in principle the thesis of Bergson that the
earthly environment is essentially spatial, without denying
this quality wholly to the future environment, that of the
promoted souls. In fact, to be frank, the conception of a
wholly subjective existence does not recommend itself to the
writer. The idea of an Absolute is not here in question.
The discussion is satisfied if temperately interrogating the
finite. Psychic research is essentially experimental. It goes
so far only as it sees.
(IV 372) May 13, 1890. "What a surprise to my soul
when I saw your ma, my father and mother, Olin, and my
Frank by my side the moment my spirit entered the immor
tal body. Body! Yes, we have bodies. Then I was taken
to my home not made with hands. I felt exquisitely happy.
Uncle Isaac." It is possible that Uncle Isaac, who was a
clergyman, is using language, conventional to the cloth,
which would trip most readily from his lips through the
medium's pencil. If the idea, now quite in vogue, that the
soul detaches itself from the old body and is constituted it
self a new body, is correct, then, of course, Uncle Isaac's ex
pression cannot be taken literally. He must have felt as if
he had a new body. Did he have a new soul, also? The
inquiry is somewhat hairsplitting.
(I 24, I 25) January 7, 1870. The readiness with which
the physical passes over into the moral points out a danger
of interpretation. Old Sabra, the colored woman, says, "I
am white now." But Frankie adds, "How would her friends
know her, if she were white, when they come here?"

you? how thin the veil is? Remember, we are not like you.
We are disembodied, etherial, spiritual, sensitive even to a
breeze, therefore try to adapt yourselves to us, try to come
more in our spheres, then you will be more receptive and we
will be better able to do what we have undertaken." There
is no contradiction. The spirits claim to be like us in that
they do have bodies; but unlike in sensitiveness. The fol
lowing extract is explicit on this head:
( 1 1 1 25) October 2 1 , 1870. "Sarah, it is not pleasant for
us to come when the surroundings are not pleasant. We par
take of your feelings, feel a trembling sensation, a drawback,
which is utterly inexplicable to you, to us perfectly and dis
tinctly felt, portrayed in every nerve of our bodies. We feel
the shadows before we reach earth and draw back, while we
view you from a distance. Grandma."
(II 50) May 29, 1870. "Oh, how surprised you would
have been if you could have looked into this room and seen
us gather. We were as real, as palpable, as you are. How

opened, we so quietly withdrew from your eyes." Bashfulness !
(Ill 195) Does eating prove that spirits have or have not
bodies, when it is qualified in the following fashion, in a
description of the hospitality of the banquet hall ? "We went
through a process of taking tea and breakfast which was
perfectly exquisite. A table was spread with everything that
was beautiful to look upon, flowers, pyramids of roses and
violets, and a spiritual food which we have to draw the cur
tain upon as we cannot explain it satisfactorily to your
minds."
It is evident that the two worlds in question, the third and
fourth worlds, if we may thus attain to a workable definite-
ness, would not be distinct, on the Leibnitzian principle of
identity of indiscernibles, were there not at least one constant
factor or principle separating them. We apparently touch
upon such a factor when we discover what is uniformly
pleasant to the inhabitants of the one and the reverse to the
inhabitants of the other. Another case in point would be the
process of materialization, "which it would be disagreeable
for mortals to see." An imperfect, halfway "coming in
form" is not for human vision. By parity of reasoning, the
thousand and one brutalities and vulgarities of earth are
shocking to spirits, as stated in the last group of extracts.

Spirits qualify in the major premises: the larger includes
the smaller, the higher includes the lower.

to realize that she is not really on earth. Frankie says,
"Mamma, Leila thinks that you can see her, but I tell her
you do not, and that makes her put her little hands over her
face." S. E. L. T. remarked: "Is it really true that they see

speaking tube." Hence a spirit-child can find much to in
terest him on earth.
(I 145) March 11, 1870.
"
'Frankie is flying all over,
in the Park, here, in my arms, and everywhere.' The Doctor
was at this very hour and moment riding in the Park."
(II 22, 25) April 30, May 1, 1870. Evidently human
beings subtend the minor premise: "Little Leila and Frankie
are in form here. You cannot see them. Would that you
could. Dear Sarah, we always have forms, but when we
come to earth we materialize our forms and robes in order
that you may be able to see us more distinctly. When in
our homes above, we are very ethereal and purely spiritual."
(II 165) August 16, 1870. Spiritual vision is clarified to
the spirit. "The old garments are thrown off for the im
mortal garbs and the soul sees clearly where hitherto all has
been mystery. B. F." "Meet as though you were in reality
going before the opened eyes of those who compose your
circle. Katie, how little you realize that we see more clearly
than earthly eyes. B. E."
In Franklin's exhortations to Katie, we recognize the tone
and temper of a tried and fatherly friend. It would seem
to have been he who decided, in the late forties, that the
hour was ripe for a new spiritual movement which might
temper, and, as it were, exploit the advanced intellectualism
of the age, rendering it permanently fruitful for man in a
higher soul-structure. It would also appear to have been he
who sifted the souls of men that he might cull the most
psychic and impressible, and who declared that he had found
the indispensable supersensitives, the archsensitives, in Katie
and Maggie Fox, the little farmer-maids of Hydesville, New
York.

However, for old mortals the change called death is followed
by a rather sudden metamorphosis towards youth, which is
sometimes easy but sometimes hard. At least, it is a fair
speculation whether the hard dying of some persons does
not mean also a difficulty in rejuvenescence. The thought
lies at hand that those who are already spiritual-minded are
young in spirit and readily assume the form of maximum
beauty. Children, however, immediately after death, are
children still. Their minds expand with extraordinary ra
pidity, but their fourth dimensional bodies take time to
reach the period of maximum manly and womanly beauty.
They would require growth even under the earthly condi
tions.
(Ill 208) April 9, 1871. "Grandma is a beautiful, fresh,
young woman."
(Ill 238) May 13, 1871. "They, (Frankie and Leila)
have grown in beauty as well as stature. Olin."
(IV 93) July 27, 1885. "Well, dear Sarah, I shall not
grieve. I will tell you how happy I am here with Olin, Ma,
and all the rest. They are going to speak to you soon. Ma
has Frankie and Leila. They have grown and are very
beautiful. You will recognize them when you see them at
the open door in the daylight of heaven with the light of
purity on their brows. Emeline."
(d) The Personal Equation
Sensitiveness and sensations are universally fundamental
to life as we know it. The spirit under this aspect does
roughly respond to the qualification of "disembodied." The
shell is more delicate. Thin-skinned mortals are so far
spiritual. The disadvantage of the prominence of sentience in
the spiritual organism is evidently only brought into relief
upon excursions from the fourth into the third or other en
vironments. Within one's proper environment one is at

home. Darwin has made the expression tautological. We
cannot conceive of the fourth environment except as con
forming to this principle. If growth seems to be arrested,
and also decay, at a most favorable status of the individual,
it still holds true that adjustment of form takes place up
to such point, and that the room for spiritual development
and adjustment beyond from plane to plane (or from sphere
to sphere, as you will) is still probable and open to theoreti
cal hypothesis. The course of further and further improve
ments in our forms we cannot surmise; but a principle of
abiding identity and of conservation would seem to be im
plied in the winged phrase, "Man is created after the Image
of his Maker."
Pioneer psychic researchers confined their labors to experi
ments demonstrative of the fact of survival, culminating in
the "cross-correspondences." Their arguments, however,
were chiefly founded on the improbability of the Hudsonian
"telepathic hypothesis." The pioneers never suspected or
feared that the term "telepathy" was not applicable to the
process of intermundane telegraph. They accepted it as the
best working hypothesis. The existence of this faculty car
ried no restrictive earmark, withholding it from general cir
culation in all worlds. However, materialism at first denied
the existence of the faculty, and then, overthrown at this
stand, pounced upon the word, under its narrowest interpre
tation of laboratory telepathy between living subjects only.
This interpretation was and is always read into the word by
materialists, with the result that the conclusions are dia
metrically opposed when used by a materialist or by a
spiritist.
There are few mediums whose work can be trusted for its
internal evidence. Not so Katie. The influences that se
lected her for the instrument of a revolutionary demonstra
tion, an epoch-making step in man's spiritual evolution, knew
uncommonly well their business. They discovered the great

est medium, the one whose faculties for transmission were
the purest, and which functioned anyhow, at the expense
often of her personal prosperity and finally of her life.
The internal evidences of survival in Katie's messages are
of the highest importance, and none more perhaps than the
witness borne to the sensitiveness of the spirits displaced
into a physical district like that of earth. The argument
runs that the reduction of the difference between the third
and fourth dimensions to its lowest terms involves a con
tinuation in the future state of everything that interests
humanity as such. Personality is generally viewed as an
important human interest. It may be exaggerated, but needs
no real defense. It is as impossible to avoid the prevalence
of personality as to avoid crystallization. Can any state
ment from psychic source be more pertinent to survival than
admissions of sensitiveness, often humanly and brutally
viewed as weakness, â€”really the most crucial test of life?

that the degree of materiality of the spirit and of the tool,
say, or furniture, or clothing, tend to equality? Thus the
spirit "coming to earth" really operates a certain demate-
rialization upon what he contacts, or, as it were, locally
alters its environment. The doctrine of selection and sur
vival is reversed, environment is fitted to the animal.
The most generally accepted view of morphological va
riations is that they are due to the environment. That is
the grand, permanent cause. Life is little else than an ef
fort to adapt its manifestations to permanent conditions.
To one looking still further back into the basis of things,
it will become apparent that life itself is the more permanent
cause, "weaving its own environment." The chrysalis is no
chance illustration. The writer has dwelt on this funda
mental work of life in another connection.
The fact that the environment seems so permanent is what
bulks with the biologists. For their special purposes their
view of environment is well enough. But the physicist looks
on the matter differently. Creational physics and chemistry
here as elsewhere reach hands to psychic research. The rock
is, in a quasi-physical sense, of spiritual origin, as is the soul,
in the fuller sense. Our logical separation and distinction
of matter from spirit in their various degrees are simply
question of the creational order of phenomena. Some spirit,
The Spirit, can, within its personal domain, by its command
over spirit, even do and undo primitive acts of creation, in
or through its pyknotic forms, say through minerals, fluids,
plants or anything fixed and objective. The idea that all is
spirit is a very good idea, intelligently appreciated. Re
lated is the question of dualism: is there a law that spirit
and matter tend to materialize and dematerialize, step by
step? Again, the danger appears, so obvious in some of our
recently proclaimed, naive, brummagem religions of confus
ing the principle of deriving objects from the subject, with
the heresy of identifying the object with the subject. The

spirit, and spirits cannot fall sick! Belief in the spiritual
foundation of the universe throws little light on its processes,
but only on its origins.
(Ill 15) October 2, 1870. "Oh! We are human in our
feelings, only gone to another country, there to wait for our
loved ones. Grandma."
(Ill 70) December 2, 1870. "There is a constant flow
from me to you and from you to me. Olin."
(Ill 71) Idem. "Let us depart. Your wish keeps us
here, especially your children ; and they require now the pure
atmosphere of heaven ; and their robes must be changed and
their flowers arranged."
Spiritual sensitiveness would seem to be such that spirits
are overpowered by the darker, more animal will of earth.
However, this applies only, perhaps, during the earthly visit
or sojourn. The disembodied spirit lacks the appropriate,
terrestrial will power. It has a will all its own, more tena
cious, perhaps, in proportion as it is less forceful in the brutal
sense. If the will and the intellect are of the essence of
personality, we cannot suppose them to dwindle, only to
change their application. Those writers who contemplate
a diminution of the intellectual activity in the future life
have committed the double error of identifying intellect with
conditions of space, and then of confining the idea of space
to the third dimension. Intellect cannot be wiped out by
definition.

have to get familiar with coming in your immediate pres
ence. They must become acquainted with the earthly condi
tions; therefore, we wish you to meet at half past twelve for

Olin."
(Ill 9) September 27, 1870. "The professor was in form
but not lifelike, therefore you could not be permitted to see
him. When he comes again he will be more perfect and so
gradually form until he becomes lifelike and as you loved
to see him,â€”perhaps delicate, but lifelike. Now he is gone
and will have to repose in his home above in order to get
strength for our next meeting. B. F."
If it is a shock to mortals to glimpse the abortive attempts
of spirits to take on mortality, what shock must it be to
spirits to behold the spiritual failures of mortals! The re
markable Livermore sittings of Katie (see Robert Dale Owen,
"The Debatable Land between This World and The Next,"
Book V, Ch. IV) were more successful in materialization, for
the available power was economized for that purpose and not
preempted for poetical and philosophical disquisitions. In
both circles, B. F. was leader; but the purposes were dif
ferent. The observation may be ventured that materializa
tions to the point of lifelike likeness and visibility is more
immediately striking and impressive, whereas the careful
elaboration of the pictures and of what we may call the
exegetical text, is better calculated to produce lasting con
viction.

Provinces of Russia, whose person seemed to suffer disso
ciation, in that while her opaque, terrestrial self continued to
go about and act, although rather perfunctorily and sub-
normally, her attenuated, transparent double simultaneously
was visible to the pupils; who, for instance, saw the double
sitting in a chair in the study room, while the "real" or
"original" woman was at the same moment seen languidly
picking flowers in the garden.2 Excursions of the double, or
etheric, or astral body, more frequently leave the terrestrial
body in a state of complete sleep or trance. These cases of
divided personality are to be distinguished from cases of
"multiple personality," which name has been given to the
successive changes of personality which some persons have
undergone, and which may be due to a sudden modification
of the brain or of the psychology in some of its departments.
In these cases, the patient assumes different characters,
sometimes abruptly, like the "lightning change" actors of
the stage. Such change may conceivably be due to a con
flict or maladjustment between our supposed normal different
"bodies." If so, that would differ from divided personality
specifically only in the way in which the constituent minds
or bodies act toward each other,â€”in the one case modifying
each other, in the other, however, separating from each
other.
In the latter case, also â€”that of divided personality â€”the
vagrant body may simultaneously be made visible to the
outer eye of the ordinary observer, or may be attuned to
affect only the spiritual eye of the encephalic mirror of sus
ceptible persons.
Approach of final dissolution of body and soul may be
extremely slow. For a long time, for days, the cementing
together of the earthly personality may rest in doubt; a
hair's weight may turn the balance from union to disunion

or back again. And so the soul may vibrate from and to
the body an indeterminate number of times, until the in
evitable, final dissolution does occur.
However, this final act, death, is the limiting case of di
vided personality and hence is no true illustration of it. It
is a quasi-birth. It is no more a division of personality than
when a baby is born and thus separated from the personality
of its mother, or when a butterfly leaves the cocoon. Death
is a definitive division which amounts to a recreation or re
newal of personality in principle; conceivably there may be
loss or gain, but not division. Birth lays the foundations
for a structure of personality. The theory of reincarnation
states that birth offers a new opportunity for an old, a very
old, personality called a monad. My conviction is that one
should be very cautious in basing conclusions upon a theory
of reincarnation. The death we are interested in is a re
newal of an earthly personality.
The case of Mary Hooker Burton illustrates not only
the delicate, tenuous association of body and soul, precursor
of approaching dissolution, (cases also occur where health is
restored, death being avoided) but, specifically, the power
of attraction of spirits by Katie. For it is said that a me
dium
is,
to the spirit,
a
perceptible light in the darkness, to
which the spirit gravitates. Why the light should be visible
only to certain spirits, does not concern us now. This book
would raise
a

come. The Doctor and Willie were present. She wanted
pencil and paper at once, and in that same cramped hand
came this:
"
'Note the time that I came yesterday.' At this point the
pencil went to the tablet and wrote in the now familiar hand:
'Please read our poor, dear friend's letter of Tuesday for
reasons I will explain later. W. H. V.' We read the message
of Tuesday, when the pencil returned to the sheet of paper
and continued:
"
'It was Tuesday, now I remember. I was still in the
body to all appearances; but I thought of spiritualism and
the time I thought my soul left the body and so I am here,
but, oh, friend, dear friend, tell Olin to help me.'
"
Mrs. Taylor called for Olin, who was said to be absent.
"In two or three minutes the pencil resumed as follows:
"
'My family, my husband, how he feels. Write at once
to my family. I am living. Mary.'
"
"I said, 'What Mary?' The pencil wrote, 'M. Hooker
Burton.'
"We read the name in utter amazement. We had known
Mary Hooker, some eighteen years ago, and knew that she
was married to Mr. Burton some fifteen years since and lived
in Hartford, her native city, and knew no more. What
could this mean? Was it true that she had just died?

Through the echoes they said that, when she came to us on
Tuesday, the 19th, she was not here with sufficient distinct
ness for them to know her sex, simply enough to know that
some one was changing worlds. The pencil still wrote:
"
'I am not very happy. They think I died suddenly, but
I did not. How I want to return ! How much I have to say
that I meant to have said that day when I was musingâ€”half
on earth, my thoughts in heaven. My spirit left. I thought,
"What if I should die, whom could I come through; how
let them know that I was about them?" I was troubled
very much. I thought, "I will see if I can impress any one
in New York." I thought of Katie Fox and other mediums,
of Miss Edmonds, etc.
"
'Dictated by M. H. B.
"
'Written by Olin.'
"
"Well, they are in grief now. I think, Sarah, you better
write a letter of sympathy and weave in the one great point
that Mary lives. It will open the way for you. Olin."
"My esteemed friend, I thought the reading of the mes
sage over to her would recall her thoughts and it did. We
can say no more now. We must close. W. H. V."
After a few moments, the pencil added, "I have just left
the family. Mrs. Burton departed yesterday, to all appear
ances. (Yesterday was Wednesday, and she had manifested
here on Tuesday. S. E. L. T.) I am not quite sure. They
are overwhelmed and utterly powerless. I think they will
seek this intercourse at once, as the death on earth was sad
and unpleasant. Olin."
"We were more and more amazed. We searched the daily
papers and as soon as the Doctor could leave his office, he
went to the Windsor to examine the Hartford papers, that
being her home; but no notice of Mary Hooker Burton's
death; and without other evidence I could not write Mrs.
Hooker. On the evening of the 22d, the Doctor went again

(IV 183) January 23, 3 p.m., 1886. "On the morning of
this date I wrote Mrs. Hooker, and at this hour Katie came
in and the pencil wrote,
"
'How can I thank you for your kindness? What can I
say? Mother will come soon. I must go and rest. I am so
weary, so tired. I long for rest from anxiety. My family
draws me so near them, that I feel most grateful to you

'My dear Sarah, I feel that a great flood of sunshine
has fallen across your pathway since you wrote that letter
to Mary's mother. You will bathe in it on earth at some
future time. Her husband is a nice man, I think, and some
great good will come out of all this. It is another great
proof of this power to place on record; another great study
for scientific men. Olin.'
"
(IV 187, idem.) "There has been great good done by your
letter to Mary's family. I cannot foreshadow the results,
but they will be unusual and of the greatest interest. I think
you will have an eventful week, my sister. Sleep with the
blessings of all upon you. Olin."
(IV 188) January 25, 11 p.m., 1886. "Early in this eve
ning Mrs. Hooker came to see Katie and learn more. She
said that on Tuesday, at the time Mary wrote the few sen
tences here, she lay apparently dozing for more than an hour.
She corroborated all Olin had said about the sadness con
nected with her death. At this hour she went to her room."

CHAPTER V
SPIRITUAL WAYS AND MEANS
(a) Planes and Spheres
If any confidence is to be placed in the spirit messages as
descriptive, then those who believe that the mundane re
lation between subject and object has no validity in the
fourth dimension, shoot wide of the mark. Their idea,
is,
in
fact,
a
non-idea. To heaven's inhabitants, the wonted,
social interdependence would be soon forgotten, and their
distinct existences would become meaningless to themselves,
while to mortals the chart to heaven would ever remain as
a
sealed book. Possibility of anticipating the realization of
the fourth dimension in imagination inheres precisely in the
following out from the third into the fourth of the familiar
contrast of subject vs. object.
However, we cannot lay down the study of the relation
and contrast
in
question, without an impression and regret
ful concession of some weakening or diminution of
it
in the
next world.
It
is,
doubtless, our lack of imagination that
forces the admission. The wonted equation,â€”subject = ob
jectâ€”seems unbalanced because we cannot readily conceive
of material in
a
spiritual world. We possess minds of the
"either-or" order. The difficulty doubtless
is
largely verbal.
Since spirit
is
rhetorically the antithesis of matter, we as
sume the spiritual world to be devoid of matter.
But we forget two circumstances of utmost importance:
(1) the name "spirit world"
is
merely
a
name, and carries
with
it
no scientific sanction, and (2)
if
"matter" does not
exist in the spirit world, there
is
no necessary implication
that its place
is
not supplied by some other form of ob

jectivity,1 whatever name we chance to apply to it. Probably
some new name will be invented. The communications,
speaking with reference to materialization, mention the gath
ering of the "materials" for materialization. Recent
researches indicate that such materials are drawn from
human beings. Can no-matter gather matter?
The whole confusing discussion about "spirit" and "mat
ter" will doubtless be relegated to the lumber room of out
worn metaphysics by the labors of our physicists, who will
count and label for us the wave-lengths and wave-frequencies
of a cosmic force or ray constituting the material appro
priate to terrestrial, on the one hand, and on the other, to
super-mundane or quadratic, environments, respectively.
Meanwhile, in spite of the agnostic caution of some of our
psychic researchers, it is not uninteresting to know what the
personalities speaking through the lucid psyche of Katie Fox,
venture to assert, as fit for our ears and for our comprehen
sion, about their homes and lives.
(II 131) July 22, 1870. "A home of peace, of beauty
which it is impossible to paint in words. A home made of
the choicest flowers, the choicest leaves, climbing roses, cling
ing vines, is ours.
"Our seats are made of green turf, our paths are gemmed
with costly pebbles, our doors are filled with the choicest
stones, and our forms repose on sofas of the most delicate
flowers. Oh! Sarah, the most beautiful flower on earth can
not be compared to the simplest moss in our garden. Can
you imagine this?
"Then we have rooms of a different description, plain and
neat, so that we will not weary, where we go to commune
with the past, where we pray for our loved ones, where we
go to receive our duties, where we watch the new spirits
1 To many, the employment of the term "matter" in connection with
the next world comes as no less than stultifying. Sir Oliver Lodge seems
to be of this number. The discoverer of the ether ought to know. The

enter their new lives. Oh! would that I could explain clearly
to your understanding.
"But, dear Sarah, it is in my palace of beauty where I am
mostly with the children. Oh! our world is beautiful, holy,
and ever-changing in its beauty. Some new joy is daily
meeting our eyes. Often, when a dear friend passes by, a
token of love will be left in our windows, or at our doors,
or in our gardens. Today, Professor Kenyon left an ever
green filled with birds for the children. Your Ma."
Taken in a literal sense, the above extract affords food
for reflection. On any fourth dimensional hypothesis, rare
and costly flowers and jewels do not imply an economic re
striction of supply, such as exists in third dimensional econ
omy, but rather an unusual taste or art which knows these
things, possesses them subconsciously, and is competent to
evoke them objectively, so that they are manifest, through
a heavenly economy, which appears to pass over the plurality
of both or all of our industrial classes, and fashion its ma
terials by the power of thought or of a brief extension of
thought-tools. It will be seen that construction methods
do not dispense with the prerequisite of time. Sufficient of
the third-dimensional ways and means persist to guide our
comprehension. Celestial skyscrapers rise fast, but are not
made in a day, if we believe that celestial economy requires
this style of building. Indeed, even upon earth, it is
only economic motive which invents and tolerates the sky
scraper, which seems to be the height of life turned
within.
Memory is of the essence of personality. On the yon side
of earthly life, theories of survival of the individual without
memory afford no place for communings with the past. Some
men have better memories than others. Some may readily
forget earthly life and its lessons. Will it be well for them?
If memory is so important, that must be because earthly life
is important. This dealing with matter, this recalcitrancy of

cubic economy, this battle with the elements and with com
petitors and for a living, is a stern school. It means some
thing. The issue is moral. There must needs follow time
and place for reflection, and for fixing its conclusions upon
our subconscious, our fundamental self ; and where can that
time and place be found but in a fourth dimension?
In solitude instructions are received, and the advent of
new spirits watched. We cannot clearly know how this is
done, but is it not just what we should approve were we in
dependently to plan a fourth dimension? To be alone and
yet to see whom we may help, to be alone and yet receive
commands that issue from no potentate or martinet but
from the inner nature of thingsâ€”that is just the ideal we
are after.
Is it merely an ideal that is reflected in the sensitive soul
of Katie? How, then, did it get there? Doubtless Katie
has a wire to the essential nature of things, which she in
terprets in a personal, human fashion. But that wire is not
simple, direct. It is personal, indirect: a High One speaks
through her. If the ideal were not also somewhere along
the wire a reality, this would be a shadow universe and third-
dimensional interests would fail of interpretation, of signifi
cance. By merest chance they would be as they are. They
would be a corner of chaos. It is the ideal that gives mean
ing to the pragmatic, and that can only be because the ideal
is,
in
its turn, real.
A
world "ever changing in beauty"
is
also one not of imag
ination. Celestial skyscrapers are, indeed, the work of celes
tials, but outer nature
is
everywhere the work of God, even
though He may employ directly for this purpose the same
materials, the same vibrations, the same infinitesimal work-
tools that he puts at the command of spirits for their in
dividual creations, their garments, their palaces. Such
a
world will be highly symbolical, that
is
to say, will be filled
with imagery, for upon imagery rests all our comprehension

of things; and so it is natural and gladly imposed to speak
the language of flowers, to respect moods of aloofness when
the spirit sports his oak as sign that the hour of communing
is here. The Legacy contains numerous passages in the
strain of the above one, and their exegesis is most fruitful
in prizes of reflection.
I shall now depart from my declared intention of confining
the citations to those of an evidential nature. The reader
will not regret the lapse and perchance may conclude that
what censoriousness rejects may humanly prove most con
vincing. No other apology is offered for this long extract:
(III 58) November 17, 1870. . . . "My dear child, I
promised to come here this morning and tell you all about
our banquet hall and its beauties. I am here, my child, to
fulfill my promise. We were all there. When I went in
with the two children, Olin was talking in the music room,
with Prof. Hare and his wife. The children saw him first
and bounding from me, ran to see which would be in Olin's
arms first. Frankie's speed was broken by Prof. Hare and
Leila was the winner. Then your Grandpa and Grandma
came in and reclined on a sofa near the entrance to the hall
in order to see all who came in. A young man of great
intelligence introduced himself to me and wished me to help
him open the way to his mother, that he might be able to
comfort her. He departed this life in Cincinnati. His name
is Alfred Burns. He is an only son, aged twenty-two. I
am going to try to impress his mother to go to some medium
in that city, when she will hear from her son. I will have
more to tell you about that at a future time.
"Emma Taylor and her father were there. She is a pretty
girl and very pure as her dress indicated; it was white
trimmed with violets. Your Uncle Thomas, his father and
mother, Olin, Prof. Kenyon, Prof. Hare, Mrs. Kenyon, Mrs.
Hare and I went out and sat upon the veranda and there
we talked about the things nearest our hearts. I told them

how I had just left you, and that you still remembered them
with appreciation, which pleased and gratified them. While
I sat talking with these beloved friends, Leila came to me
with her harp in her hand, which had been presented to her
by Dr. Franklin, and this shall be portrayed to your eyes.
"She was a beautiful picture, with her fair hair flowing,
her pink dress and fine face, her white rosebuds, and wreaths
over her dress. Oh! how beautiful she looked to all our eyes.
So she came for me and wanted me to thank Dr. Franklin for
her beautiful harp of so many strings. I went with her and
found him walking up and down the hall, holding Frankie by
the hand. In deep, fatherly tones, he asked, 'My son, what
can I give you? What would please you most?' Frankie
answered, 'Oh, teach me how to paint flowers, such as in my
home, for my mamma's and papa's Christmas present, and I
will ask no more for a long time.' Then the answer from that
good man came tenderly and lovingly, 'My son, you shall
paint your flowers, a beautiful wreath of flowers for a
Christmas gift to your mamma and papa, and I will help you.
Go, my son, rejoice in the sunshine, catch the butterflies, but
do not keep them, and when the hour for you to paint comes,
I will send a little dove with a rose in its mouth, as a token
that I am ready to teach you.' Frankie was so happy that
Leila could not make him listen to her harp, but today they
are both sitting under the blossoming trees, playing upon the
harp.
"One circumstance occurred which caused a shadow to fall
upon the gayety of the scene. A young woman came in the
side door. She was dressed in dark clothes, her spirit was
sad. At first I did not recognize her for her face was veiled
to keep out the splendor that was too much for her vision.
She motioned me to come to her. I did so and recognized
Mrs. Scott 2
who wished to be excused from the banquet as
her soul was dark with forebodings; and she wished me to

happy. This threw a little sadness over me.
You see how real our lives are.
"I met people I knew when I was a child, and was rejoiced.
I met, in passing from music and flowers into a more quiet
part, John Brown, walking arm in arm with Abraham Lin
coln. I was happy for I read in his soul that nothing could
give him more joy than walking with that great, good man,
President Lincoln. He has his reward now. The chant of the
angels closed the amusements, but the children would not
leave till the Professor took them by the hand to their own
homes.
"Sarah, let me tell you another little circumstance. You
must not feel the least sadness after you hear it. In the
midst of all these great, glittering joys, Leila and Frankie
called for their mamma to come and see their beautiful place.
Leila ran out calling, 'Mamma, come/ and I left the circle
to comfort her and play on the harp. She soon understood
and was as happy as ever. All is well ! Your Ma."
He must be a tough customer who beginning to read the
above description in a cold, psychologic mood can finish it
without melting down into something more akin to the psy
chopathic.
(Ill 194) March 21, 1871. Olin speaks of a meeting in
the banquet hall:
"We went through a process of taking tea and breakfast
which was perfectly exquisite. A table was spread with
everything that was beautiful to look upon, etc. . . . We are
about leaving our old homes, the ones we have occupied and
called our own for a great length of time. We are not going
to leave them, they will be our homes, but we are having pre
pared for us a palace higher among the homes of the Great
Masters. We have advanced so rapidly that we are about
having this blessing bestowed upon us. But when you come
here we shall first take you to the homes we are in now, and

they are beautiful beyond description; then we will take you
to our palace, Sarah, where none save our own family will be
present. Are you not happy to know this? It is a boon not
granted to all, and this is a located home. We are preparing
it. We are not yet permitted to enter it. It will be some
time before we can complete our palace. I have not told of
this before, for fear it would disturb our happiness."
I am eager to concede that Katie is a poetess. I claim it.
Her vaporings, if you will, come from the same source with
those of the so-called poets. To the ancients, poets seemed
to be creators, at least doers of great deeds. Culture, school
ing, refined their product. Whence, however, came the raw
material? the divine afflatus? the other-worldly atmosphere,
longings, hopes, ideals, and imputations? How could a Rob
ert Burns produce a wonderful masterpiece, putting divinity
into humanity and animals and everything, after simply a
few hours of upright musing during work in the fields? The
glimpses we get of the man are all of a piece. They need no
hallmark but their own cogency.
To my mind, the life work of Katie lends authenticity to
every uplifting of the spirit which the spirit may, of native
cunning, approve. The materialist is satisfied with demon
stration that the afflatus is useful and responds to needs of a
nervous mechanism which aeons have evolved. Indeed, we
are lucky to carry the materialist along with us so far. But
we would carry him further: we would show him that the
tangible and visible historical is complemented by the intan
gible, invisible spiritual. What can he answer, now that the
march of science is rapidly rendering the intangible and in
visible to be tangible and visible? While philosophy and
religion have insisted that the tangible historical is but a
process, not a substance, and a process imperfectly elaborated,
a mechanism crudely restricted, totally inadequate to account
for even the visible results. The province of poetry, religion,
literature, and philosophy is precisely to remind men of the

inadequacy of the visible to the needs of the soul, one of which
is that of complete understanding.
The first mention of the palace was of date March 21, 1871.
The beginning of construction, therefore, was not subsequent
to that date. The plans and architecture and landscape
effects may have been in study previously, but not until
authority had been received to build upon a restricted and
extremely advantageous building site, a location publicly
announcing advanced status.
(IIl 206) April 8, 1871. "Our palace is nearly com
pleted."
(IIl 207) April 9, 1871. "The children are better here.
They wish to choose your rooms and make them beautiful
for you long before you come here to enjoy them. You build
houses on earth to occupy only a short space of time. We
build them to last for eternity. You work and weep and
struggle. We work in the sunshine of eternal life, and what
we build up never bears marks of decay. Our palace is nearly
completed. Then we shall be by ourselves; then we shall be
private; none except those for whom we have real, heart
affection can enter. You, dear Sarah, can imagine what a
joy this will be to us. Today, when we leave you, we shall
take the children to learn the way of the most beautiful
parts and also select the music-room. This is very impor
tant, more so than we can convey to your understanding, for
they are children still in knowledge and our duty is to teach
them. Grandma looks lovely today. She is a beautiful,
fresh, young woman. She says she wishes Sarah and George
were here for a short time to see how beautiful everything
is about us. We do not want to take you away yet to remain,
as your work on earth is not finished."

palace." In other words, the palace is finished in construc
tion May 21st, exactly two months after the first notice.

properly so-called, and how much in working out details
of architecture, ornamentation, and effects, we are not told.
It was and is no gossamer fabric.
Insurance companies set down annual depreciation of
houses from 2]/2 per cent for masonry, on up. And so it
goes into the detailed statements handed in with the in
come tax report. That is the best that can be done with
materialism in architecture. Cyclopean structures of an
tiquity, pyramids, tombs, temples, palaces, have, in frostless
air, survived as ruins for thousands of years as evidence of
what could not be kept up. Fourth-dimensional construc
tion is more permanent. There the will of man encounters
better while more plastic material. Is material there more
subjective, or, on the contrary, more objective? In other
words, in the fourth-dimension, does the rapport, subject vs.
object, tend more toward identity or rather toward height
ened contrast? Our knowledge of these matters leaves much
to be desired,

in fact, in its infancy.

palace. Day began with us some hours ago. We are in our
palace, our beautiful palace. We have our soul's desire, no
wish ungratified, and we feel adoration and love for our
great Creator, who so freely bestows upon us these blessings."
(Ill 261) June
1,
1871. "Dear Sarah, this
is
the first
day of June and our family have taken possession of our
palace
in
the Garden of Eden. We occupy different apart
ments and can be by ourselves when we desire. There are
chapels in our palace where we can silently worship and
meditate. To paint the beauty of our home
is
impossible;
no fairy land has ever been more beautifully portrayed than
this palace of beauty which needs not the pen of
a
fabulous
brain to add one flower to its perfection. Every leaf, every
bud, bows before God as the Creator of every blessing. . . .
Today
is
a
bright and holy day, we have reached the goal
of our desires and like one family we shall live to all eternity.

We will, dear Sarah and George, be permitted to do more
for you now in our palace. The doors were all thrown open
and sacred harps sounded as we entered. Let us thank God.
We cannot say now, 'Where are the friends that we used
to have? Where are the joys of earlier years?' All, all are
here. Then for you to know that some day you too will in
habit our dwelling! We will not leave out one of your
beloved. Uncle Albert and his children were a little surprised
to be admitted at once to our circle. We all love him and
take pleasure in his society. Prof. Kenyon and his wife
are also our family, and now, dear Sarah, I will close with a
few remarks from one higher in intellect than myself. . . .
Take pride in good and never despond. Leave through
life the gift of pardon in the pathway of every erring mortal
whose early hopes are crushed, but still looks up to heaven.
A smile of forgiveness from you will perhaps be a star to
cheer and comfort; and for every joy you give we will give
unto you doubly. . . . Jesus was full of forgiveness for all
human passions and he loved to alleviate those wounds.
This He said, "Much shall be forgiven thee because thou
hast loved much,"â€”a sublime pardon. Why should we re
fuse the helping hand to those whom we meet bleeding from
the evil of a long career? Why should we refuse to dress
their wounds? Mortals must not be more strict than Christ.
The child is small, yet it is linked with the immortal mind;
the eye a mere speck, yet it takes in leagues.
"
'Judge not by appearances. The rough nature contains
the diviner part. Blessed are those who help to cultivate that
spark of goodness.' . . .
"The golden rays of the sun shone upon our paths today
with new joy. From our palace windows we will look
towards you and ever keep a vase of flowers to mark the
future of each one of you (our family). May you ever be
happy and this day with its holy gifts be remembered. Olin
â€”Circle."

"We found upon the bureau a beautiful white daisy with
its root in soil four inches deep. It had twelve blossoms
and weighed, with the soil, exactly one pound. . . . The fol

These passages breathe a spirit which would conquer the
world with love, home, and family. Along the vista of his
tory we can see this spirit at work : in totemism and fetichism,
in superstition, in religion, in polytheism, and naturalism, in
monotheism, in Judaism, in Christianity, in philosophy,
in poetry, in romance and in art in its various departments â€”
where has it been absent? Christianity has been its most
authoritative institution. Are its forces not also manifest in
witchcraft, poltergeist, and "spiritualism"?
What we must know, at this stage of the game of life, is
whether the uplifting activities listed above and others of
like genus, are explainable on the restricted, accepted bases
of ( 1 ) utility as practiced in the way of selection and sur
vival and (2) visibility and tangibility, as established by the
advance of science, its tools and processes, at any given
moment, or whether we must believe in additional ways and
means, beyond our experience, still more unfamiliar than
the furthest reach of science. We answer: ways and means
both primitive and teleologic, partly operating along the
fringe of experimental, recognized evolution, anyhow shading
off into the Infinite Source of Being.
The invisible evolution would, perhaps, be parallel to the
visible, but not a mere formal dualism of mathematical
parallels which touch only at infinite distance. On the con
trary, the dualism here implied is an active, history-long
interference and operation of the invisible upon the visible.
Are dark forces invisibly at work? The powers of light
from brighter realms must also have their say, otherwise
mortals have little to hope. Each person will decide this

If he do not look above now, probably he will later; his
opportunity will come. There is such a thing as being too
much in a hurry. Precipitation into fanciful beliefs is
dangerous, superstitious. A man must capitalize his soul for
what it will produce in the long run.
Those very respectable poets who sign themselves "Olin"
and "Grandma," are no primitive, dark, formless elementals,
vamping on the bright innocence of earth. Rather they look
to me like the last word of God's creation, representative of
our ideals, living among substantial ideas, His vicars to rule
the world. I should be proud to be recognized by such mas
ters. And is our Katie any less a poetess that her sources
of inspiration acknowledge their names and sign them to
their documented words? This advance in accuracy of de
marcation of the personal and of the individual is surely a
step forward, for it adds to our knowledge, our penetration
into what has hitherto seemed a surrounding gloom.
(I 99) February 13, 1870. "The day is one of great
beauty to us, for we can soar above, so high above the earth
to higher spheres, where those whom we have often read of
in history are." This earlier passage apparently speaks of
the general region or direction to which they (the circle)
afterwards permanently migrated, building there their se
cluded and exclusive palace. A poetic passage like this one,
simple and direct in its human sense, precisely offers the
greatest resistance to a rational, materialistic analysis. The
first and greatest difficulty is to reconcile a permanent abode
with access in all directions, apparently, from and through
space. In three-dimensional existence the birds (and now
airplanes) traverse the lower strata of the air but must
always, as it were, return to roost. Even a captive balloon
must be pulled down, if it would not tarry to sink of its own
weight. Fourth-dimensional theory, indeed, in one of its in
terpretations, denies free access to the skies, at least in any

astronomical sense. The roads through the skies are fixed,
to a certain extent, by the theory of "curved space." Others
have thought that this theory was due to inability of mathe
maticians of vigorous imagination to discriminate between
demonstrable fact and brilliant hypothesis. In other words,
the mathematical mind is excusably and most-to-be-expect-
edly so constructed as, after long fixing of attention upon an
hypothesis, to forget that it is an hypothesis. For the pur
pose in hand, indeed, it is useful to the mathematician to
forget the hypothetical character of given premises. The
more he works them the more they assume the quality of
facts. So the hypothesis of curved space is not, perhaps, the
last word.
Nor is the hypothesis of rotated cubes. As the plane is
"rotated" to form the cube, so is the cube "rotated" to form
the tesseract. Here is the hard part: As the cube contains
simultaneously all the positions of the plane, so does the
tesseract contain simultaneously all the positions of the cube.
You have to imagine this result. Diagrams in third dimen
sion cannot illustrate nor demonstrate fourth-dimension ap
plications or logical conclusions.
The realization of this analogy or application of a fixed
rule conceived on a hypothetical basis, for the evolution of
space as objective, might be for man to fix himself or his
house anywhere and yet to enjoy much greater liberty of
motion than in the third-dimension. For the hypothesis is
that spaces are, as it were, overlapping and mutually or com
monly self-containing; so that these conditions offer much
greater play for the will than in exclusively three-dimensional
space, where the will grasps at intelligently constructed
wagons, autos, railways, ships, airplanes as tools, in order
to realize a limited freedom of motion.
Evidently men will not rest satisfied short of some explana
tion appealing to their third-dimensional intelligences for

exertions of the same intelligence or personality in different,
perhaps antipodal, countries and places, such as are illus
trated by "cross-correspondences," where, at or about the
same moment, one part of a sentence or distich is written
automatically in England, while the passage is completed
in India. There is something there in the nature of the
telegraph. Do we need the fourth dimension in order to
explain the telegraph?
And yet, perhaps, there may be here a case of comple
mentary explanations. The ether is a property of nature
which contradicts many accepted ideas of physics which work
well enough in our humdrum lives. It is elastic but incom
pressible. It affords the springiness of things, the quality
by virtue of which springs insist on recovering their original
form. It has a strong tendency, therefore, to readjust and
redress all deviations in space: one might almost say that
it tends to annihilate space by reducing it to zero, for it
undoes everything that is done.
Thus the elasticity of the ether is quite consistent with
its incompressibility â€”a combination of qualities, however,
unknown to common physics. And again, the hypothesis of
the ether is quite consistent with that of the fourth dimen
sion. The two hypotheses perform the same legerdemain,
the one in the name of physics and the other in the name
of geometry. The ether is thus a solid foundation for a
palace and an admirable express train.
The witch riding on a broomstick has, under the favoring
sun of Christianity, in spite of cruelty and persecution,

humanity that counts. Either men survive or they do not.

with men remaining in third dimension or they do not. How
ever, those who have pinned their faith to other explanations,
such as on that of a limited but omniscient and thus hypo
thetical telepathy, come uniformly to grief. Hyslop was
right in putting demonstration of continued personality at
the base of psychic research.
"Where those whom we have often read of in history are."
This innocent appearing phrase immediately raises the ques
tion of historical justice. There is a naive implication that
those who are great on earth are perpetuated in their high
office or public esteem in the fourth dimension. The im
plication, however, is to a degree gratuitous. They may,
peradventure, be less esteemed. Moreover, there is no neces
sary implication that all the great of the earth ascend to
high spheres, without more. The expression is ingenuous,
as is occasionally the work of Olin and his mother and
grandmother. It goes straight to the heart, but it neglects
theories, generalizations of the scientific order, and intel
lectual complications which are more of encumbrance, after
all, perhaps, than of help.
For what shall we say of Benjamin Franklin? He is an
honorary member of the Family. But his permanent abode
is his own, separate, and presumably in the sphere of the
great. His scientific and intellectual interests, his powerful
will and memory, his unrivaled poise, make it profitable
for him to keep up third-dimension connection. He is the
engineer of the great revival of psychic interest beginning
with the late forties of the nineteenth century, and the in
ventor of the intermundane telegraph.
On the other hand, the passage is false if it does not in
clude many of the great of the earth as fit for and hence
accepted into and among the great of the fourth dimension.

socialism, is stilled. But the circles who can and do com
municate with earth are not yet absolved of third-dimen
sion interests, duties unfulfilled, opportunities of service
hitherto overlooked, family ties still close enough to be
absorbing, especially the relations of parent and child, hus
band and wife.
Doubtless the great of the third dimension have there been
recipients of special help. Men wonder that persons who
have attained to rank and fortune by chance or craft are
observed beyond expectation to rise to the occasion, to grow
to the full stature of their duties. No full account of men's
conduct can be based solely on a biological psychology. The
beginnings of terrestrial life may have been purely biological
and cellular. The theory of atomic immanence is not to be
taken trivially. Predestination may have resided immanent
in cells for countless ages. Gradually, however, a vapor of
consciousness hovered above the world of sensations and of
sensory reactions. This vapor surely crystallized into an in
visible structure of self-consciousness, embodying, ideally,
and all unseen, the purposefulness of animation. A nascent,
invisible world, by-product of animal striving, is now ac
cessible to direct, cosmic influences previously barred out
from the exclusively biologic scheme.
The finite, human mind is appalled and balks at the pos
sibilities thus opened to beings of such humble ancestry as
man. The differentiate of formless leviathans and of mowing
apes assumes divine form, comes to his own, and hits the
pike of Paradise. In the hot-house heyday of Hellenism, a
Plato writes the mystic symbolism of The Cave. The Idea
is brought into the field of consciousness. Culture becomes
the object of striving. The circle becomes sign of the stage
where the kaleidoscope of Being is arrested and fixed at the
phase of morality. War and crime no longer exist for the
esoteric man except by inheritance from the rejected past.

even divines, innocently inconsistent, would win their flocks
to virtue by stoutly affirming that heaven is all about us, if
we will only open our eyes. Spiritualists, however, remind
the preachers that in their enthusiasm for a new, brilliant
idea they have unwittingly been victimized by rationalism.
Steady-going, approved religion has ever insisted that the
fairest fields of earth are a feeble copy of heaven. The
invisible structure reared by nascent consciousness has been
kissed by direct influences streaming and attracted toward
it and woven into imperishable ideas. Dogmatize as we may
with the artifices of language and with the arts of earth,
we cannot add one jot or tittle to the simple sayings of Olin
and Ma and Grandma.
(Ill 342) August 22, 1871. ... "We visited the ban
quet hall and met all our old acquaintances and talked over
the different degrees of happiness. Some told me that this
was their first visit to the banquet hall; that they had not
progressed very rapidly, as their hearts had clung to earth,

find pleasure in soaring higher. After they had thrown away
the desire to breathe continually the atmosphere of earth,
they found it easy to advance into the beautiful paths of

and closed the door of her reception room, saying, when she
did so, that she could not visit with them at that time. I
tried to take her place, but, as we read each other's thoughts,
the company read Ma's desire to shun them and they silently
withdrew. Ma sent for the doctor's father yesterday and
had a pleasant talk with him alone.
"My dear sister, you do not know how much we have
assigned to usâ€”how numerous our duties. We have to work
carefully to guard our loved ones on earth; we do not feel
safe about them till we have seen that every cloud is removed.
"Ma has sent Uncle Albert to see Willie safely home; so
you need feel no anxiety about him."
Olin conducts friends about the palace "to show them
what our advancement and spiritual desires had been." The
palace is an object lesson in that it objectifies desires which
are legitimate and may be put in permanent form. Desires
become, as it were, items of private property, which are for
the purpose of teaching unto others ideas that may have
hitherto been invisible or even remained quite subjective.
Symbolism runs through the universe. It seems to be the
main interest or purpose of things. All things exist only in
order to be (1) explanatory and (2) explained. Progress is
in and through symbolism. As we advance, the symbolism
of yesterday is cast off, for it no longer grants the desired
liberation, the easing of the strain of thought or, at least,
of speculative thought.
In the third dimension, it is recognized that travel arouses
curiosity, suggests thoughts, aspirations, improvements,
which men bring home and seek to work out under home con
ditions. Because one is poor, does not debar him from some
knowledge of the refinements attainable only by wealth;
because one is ignorant, does not exclude from him all am
bition for knowledge. While earthly travel is materially or
spatially horizontal, it is symbolically perpendicular. Fourth-
dimension travel frankly materializes the perpendicular.

Lower spirits ascend to learn from higher ones. They may
not reside permanently where they have not founded a home,

The difference between third and fourth dimensions re
duces to the degree of directness in the objectifying or
exteriorizing of our thoughts and desires. Personality re
mains compact of thoughts and desires, while ways and

Comparing this passage with those which describe life in
the banquet hall or palace, we may smell an inconsistency,
if we assume that the putting on of clothes as spirits ap
proach earth implies that they were formless in their native
habitat. But this conclusion is quite unnecessary. It is
equally possible and, indeed, cogently consistent, to believe
that the garments alluded to visualize the process of mate
rialization, perhaps not the last stage, in which material is
drawn from earthly beings, men, but still a "coming in
form" in some of its stages. By parity of reasoning, we do
not need to infer that the soul, at home and in its full spirit
ual development, is purely subjective and devoid of form.
Rightly interpreted, the Record gives a real description of
life in Heaven, on which growing reliance will be placed as
faith in the Record grows.

(III 210) April 9, 1871. "To fail in keeping appoint
ments at the hours we name is one of the most lamentable
things you can do, when it is in your power to be punctual.
To be twenty minutes after the time is as unfortunate as
not to meet at all. We have duties and we set these hours
apart for your work. If you fail, we fail. We cannot wait
and linger in your atmosphere for hours after the appointed
time. Often we can only remain a few minutes. Can we
impress upon your minds the importance of being punctual
to the minute? We are not our own masters at all times,
and a higher power than (we) directs you, directs us. Re

(III 319) July 30, 1871 '"God cares for the sparrow,

God's angels care for you who trust in Him? Now, my
children, you must learn more, learn to trust. Say, "I will
believe," and in no one thing shall you be disappointed.

'What are their lives, is asked of these spirits who seek
communion with their friends on earth? I will answer.

are few when compared to the years of immortalityâ€”a few
short years on earth and the life immortal commences. Then
why not learn the way up the golden steps? B. F.'

It is a question precisely what is meant in these com
munications by the word "immortality." If that word be
taken, as seems plausible from the context, as excluding

inclined to make this concession to Theosophy. However,
astronomy teaches that the life of a planet is limited: it
dies, stops its revolutions on its axis, and ultimately dis
integrates, through foreign impact, perhaps. If souls have
lingered about it all that eternity, what of eternities to
come? The scope of the present book is willing to refer
the answer to Theosophy or defer it to the Greek Calends.

(III 89) December 11, 1870. "Dr. Franklin knows that
he is beloved here by every spirit that is able to express
itself in language, and he is always ready to aid and in
struct. He feels it a happy duty. You will find him in
every home where the inmates are worthy, bending over
the dying, cooling the feverish brow, bringing before the
dying beautiful visions, moistening the parched lips. Un
seen, he administers these blessings and they are realized
when the lips move not. Olin."
If spirits bring beautiful visions before the dying, why
not also before the inner eyes of sensitive or sensitized
mortals in general? "Cooling the brow," "moistening the
lips," are more or less figurative. The touch of a spirit comes
as a cool breeze, but hardly as drops of water or of rain.
But faith, through spirits, works wonders.

(I 219) April 22, 1870. '"I think that there are per

It is a duty as great as duties here, especially when they

Notice the recognition of the moral gradation of spirits,
and the practical admission that the most spiritual mortals re
ceive the most spiritual aid. The inference seems axiomatic,
but that is merely on account of the verbal tautology, "spiri
tual," repeated in two senses. That we enjoy material assist
ance from "the other side," is a most substantial assurance.
It might well be argued that the duty of spirits should
be the uplifting of the unspiritual, lower levels of mankind.
However, analogy is against this argument. There is here
evidently a difficulty of the sort called "environmental."
"Birds of a feather flock together." It is not practical to
descend to the depths of the third, perhaps even to the
bounds of the second dimension. "To those that have shall
be given," is not a hard saying to the weary toilers who
have stoutly, courageously, and independently built up their
souls beyond their fellows. The question of spiritual aid
to mortals and their progress is not one of a shibboleth,
nor of theoretical causes and antecedents, but of deeds.
Light is indeed reflected upon the dogma of "predestination."
Spiritual faith is not only cause but also result. As in

each birth which we experience, take rests and start a new
balance sheet. Those who have won an advantage enjoy
spiritual intercourse. The others follow on or not; we do
not need to dwell on the point, especially to the orthodox.
"We never deceive." While this sentence expresses an
essential truth, it overlooks an important principle, that con
stantly spirits employ a tremendously profound knowledge
of psychology in order to save men from mistakes. Spirits
do not hesitate to deliver themselves of a technical untruth
in order to save a career or a reputation. These white lies
of the angels are generally recognized as such by the bene
ficiaries, who need but a verbal impulse, even if an unctuous
lie, to tip the scale in favor of, say, conservative action.
Socrates' demon told him when not to do things, and doubt
less used tricks to prevent him from blurting out the truth
at inopportune moments. Finally, his time was come, and
the demon removed the ban. I believe here we have inside
information on the touching parallel between Socrates and
Christ. Neither was allowed to tell all he knew; both were
sacrificed for the little they did tell. But Christ was called
to perform on an immensely wider stage. "Against fools
the Gods strive in vain." This would seem to be an axiom
of pretty wide application. Fools can be led by wise cun
ning; they cannot be driven or argued with.

rulers is to point out to the subjects where duty for them
severally lies. It is a matter of divine organization. The
performance of duty is the highest desire. It is that desire
which has won standing for rulers with their subjects every
where. Rulers rule because subjects recognize marks of in
herent authority. Is such a government to be designated
as monarchic or democratic?
More appropriately, it is paternal. Rulers in the fourth
dimension are directly recognized and acknowledged from
their indices of individuality and quality, and that recog
nition is the alpha and omega of government in that en
vironment, as it is in the third, so far as the latter boasts
government worthy of the name. In this, as in other cate
gories of life activity, it is not inept for preachers, more
introspective than circumspect, to announce that Heaven is
here and now, only we are not able to see it; for we are
not equal to our high destiny.
It is true that the controlling intelligences and classes
of the human world are typically neither socialist nor
anarchist. That is not due, exactly, to their superior, con
scious intelligence, but to a sort of common sense which
holds them aloof from idle, speculative thought, confines
them to industry and decent, arduous living, and surrenders
their souls, to an extent, to unseen influences which protect
them and strengthen their faith and hold up their hands,
upon what is often the very slenderest, rational, doctrinal,
or demonstrable basis. How patently is this true in the
case of great statesmen, of whom Theodore Roosevelt was an
illustration!
In the fourth dimension, however, occurs a classification
of souls. Good souls are progressive souls not so attached
to preconception but that their natural sentiments play free
from prejudice. They are appreciative. They recognize
their own best interest subserved by rulers wiser than they.
By parity of reasoning, they also spontaneously recognize

the environment or level of action suited to their needs, to
their completer development, to their comfortable use and
wont. Thus they form a community apart, a paradise, the
inner temple of the fourth dimension.
It is not exactly that competition is abolished. The rather
is rivalry more friendly. The success of others affords
pleasure. Progress is not merely a rational nor an intel
lectual matter; it is not theoretical; it is not conquest over
others on the same level. In that dimension avoidance of
contest is always possible through self-improvement, and
this in a literal sense. In the third, it is the church that
has taught the turning of the other cheek, the refuge of
good works. Philosophy offers its consolations. Good men
have ever taught defense through heaping coals of moral
fire on the head of brutality, lust, and greed. The deep
students of industry and economy have neatly proven that
the very action of men's greed tends to correct itself, that
undue interest, wages, or rents are bound, sooner or later,
to fall into the rut of an acceptable, proportioned partition
of the community's income, and that speculative crises are
propagated throughout the planet.
But in the third, the working of these high-regarding
tendencies is feeble, at any given moment. While the bal
ance may, on the whole, be in their favor, the ultimate issue
seems unattainable and theoretical. There is no visible end.
Submerged man gropes on in despair and rage. Poverty
is indignant. Laziness and inefficiency rave and storm. They
have to learn the adage, "Physician, heal thyself." Know
ing little, their god is Panacea.
In the fourth, however, progress is no theoretical matter.
It is literal. Being literal, it is real. Being real, it is mate
rial. Say "relatively material," if you please. That is what
the second dimensionist says of the freedom of the third:
"It is relatively material." Anything posited to him lying

spiritual. And so to us: anything posited about fourth
seems spiritual. Put "objective" in place of "material" and
you solve your problem, which is chiefly verbal, with a
word which spans two dimensions.
But we recognize, after all, spiritual and spiritual. When
the traveler reaches fourth, these seemingly spiritual dis
tinctions grow into the full-blown, familiar relations of mind
and matter." So that reality always seems material when
it is attained; that is to say, when one has reached the
tesseract of characterization of the fourth. There progress
is real. He who progresses goes up. You can see him
go, you can wish him Godspeed. You can even pay him
a visit, "see how you like it there," test your ability to
stand that altitude, lay your plans and preparations for
future, permanent emigration. It is all so natural and real
in the fourth dimension. So much for heavenly politics.

ourselves to the unhappy, sorrowful spirits who have lately
come here. I made a circle of young women happy and
now they are in a fair way to progress. I showed them the

"Know thyself." "The proper study of mankind is man."
"Man is created in the image of his Maker."
What is the purpose of education? for instance. It must
be in order to find an answer to the other question, "What
is the purpose of life?" Life is for living. It is composed
of reason and sentiment, of art and industry, of trade and
finance, of laboratories and letters. The competition and
struggle and selection and survival are not for their own
sakes. We only learn that they exist in order that we may
know ourselves.
It is true that there is such a thing as the cult of those
materialists who have, by long use and wont in terms mate
rial, persuaded themselves that the study of nature may be
divorced from that of man. A fallacy, if ever there was one!
There is no meaning to be extracted from nature study
apart from motives, sentiments, appreciations such as man
finds in himself. The human form, in its ideal appearance,
is the acme of conceivable beauty. Man appreciates beauty
through his sentiment for the idea of himself. Man's plumb

it teaches something enduring about himself. In studying
himself, he studies all things. Understanding, appreciation,
explanation â€”what are they but the study of man? This
does not exactly mean that man stands at the top of nature.
Man is not God. But he is godlike. It is from his own
finiteness that he reaches out to infinity. Infinity is thus in
a way his. Language, science, art, religion are in and of
man. They are his approaches to knowledge. They are
part of himself.
There is then but one study â€”the study of life. In our
third-dimension schools, the science of life is inadequately
treated. Especially of late years has there been a tendency
to elaborate the bottom of the structure at the expense of
the top. Perhaps is this but a reaction from a previous
disturbance of equilibrium in the opposite direction. In
medieval times, there was much arguing (and fighting and
inquisition) about verbal matters, although real significance
was also extracted from them. Today it is too often for
gotten that man has a soul, and that education points to
the sky. Our universities are cut off from the Universal and
are become inarticulate aggregates of particulars. The
fountains of intelligence and appreciation are drying up. The
disciplines drag out a perfunctory existence. The classics are
read in translation and the lecture room is become a cinema.
But there is always a way out. When the prospect is dark
est the goal is nearest. Banished from earth, the study
of life is honored in heaven. Science, supposed by its
acolytes to have established all possible principles, culti
vated finally by them only for details and meticulosities,
asserts itself anew in principle and in a least expected field.
Its ancient votaries would surround it with the ring fence
of rules and principles once epoch-making, now inadequate,

to her desire. Radical as is the departure from third-di
mension economy, it must still be insisted that there is some
economy.
And so, per contra, it may correctly be argued that, also
in third dimension, everything is produced in response to a
wish. Cumbersome and roundabout as are third dimension
processes of manufacture, if the finished products are not
answers to wishes, they are valueless and unexchangeable.
The rigorous theory runs that values cannot surpass desires,
and that products emerge in response to expected values.
Desires are the basis of the whole structure of economy. And
since processes follow the conditions imposed by the state
of the arts and sciences, which are but appreciations of quali
ties natural in things and men, it is as true in the one dimen
sion as in the other that coveted things are furnished in
response to desire by the bounty of nature, by the goodness
of God.
The main difference to be noted between the dimensions
is the prompt answer in response to desires manifested in
the fourth. This rapidity of manufacture is coupled with
an incomparable superiority in workmanship, technique, and
design. The improvement is not surprising. In principle
it need not cause wonder. It is quite natural. But we must
admire it. Thaumaturgy is universal. Without admiration
and appreciation life is void. Social intercourse is calculated
for pleasing by novelty.
Pleasing effect will intensify with celerity of manufacture.
Fashion may change daily, individual patterns and personal
outfits hourly, without prejudice to uniformity of attire on
the part of persons whose ideals revolve about constancy.
Thus we sense that the greater rapidity of fourth dimension
manufacture and construction, as already amply voiced in
these pages, is still an integral portion of the evolutionary
scheme. In third dimension, roundabout processes and mass
production; in fourth dimension, rapid, separate production

We took the children there last evening and they were much
pleased with the white monuments about them, but could
not comprehend the meaning. So I told them there was

Then today I had to take them again, to let them choose
their different portions. Frankie would call one spot his

seat theirs, Mamma's and Papa's. Oh! how happy they
are and how happy you should be! Olin."

Wise publicists accept the family as the sociopolitical unit.
The fourth dimension of heaven revolves with the earth,
which is in the third. Otherwise there would be no evening,
at least the evenings of heaven and earth would not corre

CHAPTER VI
RELIGION
(a) God
No doubts about God cloud the reason or obscure the
faith of the population which frequent the banquet hall nor
especially of those who are privy to the palace. It is in
the idea of God that the continuity of third-dimension re
ligion is pursued into the fourth. And this idea is the chief
connection of the two dimensions, anyhow. Personality ac
knowledges its emanation from God, so that the personality
of God is a necessary corollary to personality as an abstract
conception. The truly religious but unsectarian believer of
the third-dimension has nothing to change on entering the
fourth, in this respect. If to his faith he combine an experi
mental knowledge and foretaste of the reality of discarnate
life, he respires air of the fourth-dimension without a flutter.
The Record breathes an intensity of faith almost unknown to
this carnal stage of existence. Here faith is sometimes rather
imaginatively symbolized by the word "God," than intensely
and personally felt. We cannot escape the influence of
science. It has sealed the age. It has cleared the way for
better manners and for a more pragmatic faith, a faith not
verbal, but, as it were, inductive, experimental.
Far be it from me to disseminate false dependence on a
laboratory faith. Faith is inner experience; the discoveries
of science only render that more obligatory. After all,
there is but one faith, faith in God, faith in moral order
and in supreme personality and in the supremacy of per
sonality. But the habit of the laboratory should rather aid
us to appreciation of our theistic experiences. However,

this mutuality of moral support from categories of life that
have too often been trained in the contentious is not to be
found in every psychology, every mentality. True education,
however, must seek the reconcilation.
Almost every line of the Record speaks of God, so that a
few specimens at this point must suffice:
(I 77) February 3, 1870. "The works of God are won
derful and mysterious, clothed with a thin veil so that the
earthly eye cannot behold that which should be concealed!
Be satisfied!"
(1191) April 16, 1870. "Blessed are the ways of Prov
idence. Our souls rejoice, our hands are raised in gratitude!
All is well! Be happy! After you read this, go in the
room which is sacred with the presence of sacred beings.
Olin."
(Ill 353) September 3, 1871. "My children, we are with
you. Praise God for the light of this beautiful morning.
Thank Him in your hearts for the health you enjoy. Praise
the Giver of all good. The fountain of His blessings flows
freely upon you; gather the sunshine while it lasts. We
have been your constant companions for nearly two years,
in constant communion, in close affection, and I know, my
dear children, that you are grateful for the boon. Were
we of the earth, earthly, our ways would not seem mys
terious, neither would you marvel. But we are subjects of a
Higher Power, under the direction of the Father of the whole
universe, therefore wonder not at our ways. We do all things
well. B. Franklin."
(Ill 131) January 12, 1871. . . . "Then Olin wrote in a
beautiful, clear hand (his own): 'My dear Sarah, we are
all here today. The glorious sun shines beautifully upon
you and we have accomplished much. Your heart shall re
joice on Sunday morning, and above all let me impress
upon you the importance of guarding and appreciating the

power to write with our own hands. We all go. Olin.'
"
(b) God's Immanence
(I 147) March 12, 1870. "The children are here, but
not in form. They looked in upon your faces and saw the
flowers, which have souls, for their perfumes live here in their
correspondences; therefore, never think that they are lost,
though their loveliness fades."
(II 147) August 1, 1870. "It is sweet to know that in
this city of crimes and anguish, misery and depravity, we
make a heaven about you and guard you from these evils.
Yes, dear Sarah and George, we guard you stronger and with
more safety than bolts can, and your faith shall save you
from falling victims to those who fear not God or man.
Olin."
The actual glides easily into the symbolical. In order to
ascertain the distinction between reality and poetry, it is
necessary to take into account the general trend and argu
ment of the Record. If anything is established beyond
peradventure, it is the separate reality of another dimension
or environment. There is much to show that it is located
above the earth, perhaps in to us invisible spheres. The
very assertion of flowers existing there in their correspond
encesâ€”a pregnant expression â€”involves the separate objec
tivity of that dimension. Deeply imbued with possibilities
looking toward ideal realization, clergymen and poets often
descant upon the joys of earthly life rightly lived and un
derstood: so Pastor Wagner, he of the Simple Life. In some
cases, these teachers have been satisfied with their pictures
of terrestrial bliss to the point of neglecting to locate a more
ideal bliss in more favorable surroundings.
Almost anything and everything are conceivable: for
instance, it is conceivable that terrestrial, moral conditions

question what becomes of personal individuality when the
planet dies or disintegrates is not solved on either theory.
The Record amply testifies to the beauty of earth as
well as to that of heaven; it argues, however, for the superior
beauty of heaven and for its superior desirability as a place
of abode. There
is,
perhaps,
a
certain admission of de
pendence of heaven on earth. Flowers exist in heaven by
their correspondences.
If
they did not exist on earth they
would hardly exist in heaven. But there
is
no intended ad
mission of an efficient, causal priority in earth. Terrestrial
processes are essentially roundabout. Their spiritual mo
ments are rooted far back
in
time and history, in evolution.
Immediate, direct impingement upon organisms from the
psychic
is
a
difficult subject which science
is
tardily, warily,
with hesitation and compunctions, with laboratory equip
ment, broaching. In
a
world of actions and reactions, where
the streamings from the psychic are endless and of infinite
variety,
it
is
not surprising that reactions from the terrestrial
penetrate
a
distance back into the psychic.

these distinguished men? I will tell you. As a bird seeks
its rest in a tree, so we seek those who are above us in
intellect. Our spirits attract by our desires, and more es
pecially if we had that desire before coming here. You
always had a wish to see President Lincoln and shake hands
with him. You would make the effort to see him. So it is
with us, only our wish is a prayer and attracts the spirit so
that it seeks us and the way is opened for our souls to
mingle. Olin."
(IIl 125) January 8, 1871. "You place flowers on the
little mounds, trees about them and everything to make
them look beautiful. So with us when we prepare a home
for some dear one on earth. The difference
is,
here we
prepare
a
home full of similar beauty, we leave out nothing
which will cheer the spirit. We do not make the home at
first dazzling in its beauty, we make
it
sublimely sublimed.
Those who prepare the homes here, do so under the direction
of
a
higher power than those who talk with you. Olin."
(IIl 210) May 10, 1871. "We cannot wait and linger
in your atmosphere for hours after the appointed time.
Often we can only remain
a
few minutes. Can we impress
upon your minds the importance of being punctual to the
minute? We are not our own masters at all times, and a
higher power than directs you directs us. Remember this.

"Higher Power" does not mean "God."
The term seems indefinite. Theologies of various religions
seek to furnish wondering believers with accurate accounts
of theocracy. The Graeco-Roman Parnassus is one of the
completest. Its frank carnality and anthropomorphism were
properly succeeded by the Christian reaction, whose puri
tanic theism and simplicity did not last long, as they were
a hindrance to the spread of the Christian name among
populations habituated to myths and legends. The Trinity,
the Saints Calendar, the Virgin Mary appeared upon the
religious scene in due course of time. Goth and Iberian
united their divergent Olympuses under the unique, identical
framework furnished by the Hebrews and their rejected
Seer.
While primitive Christianity was deficient in the matter
of heavenly hierarchy, it was soon perceived that heavenly
government could hardly be impersonal. It is noteworthy
that Christianity adopted without question the standards of
good and evil already current among men. The twelve
commandments were already ancient; and most of them had,
moreover, been put in practice by a majority that had never
heard them called by name. Christianity also embraced the
ancient idea of places of reward and punishment, and soon
added the proper officials. A more critical age is relegating
the angel Gabriel to innocuous desuetude, along with his
satanic majesty. Nor does our Record pretend to unveil
mysteries which are, very plausibly, not for our comprehen
sion. On no other branch of knowledge do earthites more
need to cultivate humility than on the divine.
One obtains the impression that the will of higher powers,
who are recognized, ex vi termini, as personal, is accepted
by the spiritual subjects and vassals in an impersonal sense

the spheres are unsigned. One might imagine that the
Powers have patented or copyrighted their own vibration
rates, and that wireless messages from them are received in
impersonal but identifiable, official form. But every message
must have its signer. And no one could imitate or capture
and sequester such a natural monopoly of etheric wave
length. In the merely mundane, fashions, inventions, doc
trines, opinions, encircle the world with a spontaneity that
seems unaccountable. Possibly suggestion, changing en
vironment, the usual travel of news may account for all
that we observe in the way of the spread of ideas ; there
is,
however, still room for the hypothesis of unseen messengers
and even of impersonal messages, of thought waves, quasi-
material, diffusing tone and inarticulate doctrine, broadcast
ing them to the four winds.
In the higher world
in
which we are interested, the Wall
Street ticker has its spiritual analogue. Angels consult the
wind caves of the spheres and read off their duties from such
music; they watch the flowers unfold or close, which tell
the story of another's, perchance mortal's success or failure,
happiness or misery. Apparently no Western Union inter
venes. Undoubtedly there
is
a

back to individual invention does not appear: probably it
does not. The impression remains that the economies of
the fourth-dimension stand ready-made for its population,

metals, fibers, on earth. In either case,

personal, how far impersonal. There is a temptation for
speculators in this field to overestimate the scope of the
personal. One thinks all suggestion is by personal mes
sengers; another that the earth is "ruled" by unseen, official
sages. One thinks of the generally accepted guardian angel;
and straightway we are introduced to an infinite hierarchy
of elfs, goblins, sprites, ancients, angels, archangels, and so
forth, which may or may not be our unseen superiors, at
once our gods and our servants. So my horse is my servant;
but am I not also his,â€”I who spend hours daily in tending,
grooming, doctoring, training, and exercising him?
On earth, the various orders of animals stand in relation
of mutual dependence. Ants and rodents prepare, through
untold ages, a soil and humus for cultivation. Birds sow
seeds or mimic the music of the spheres. Elephants break
down jungles and make clearings for huts of savages.
Through the million steps and adjustments from termite
to Aryan, there is mutual limitation permitting always of
higher levels of life, verging always toward the spiritual,
and progressively marked by facility of orientation, liberty
of action, practice of self-determination, in a word, by the
ideal of freedom. In all of this system is no God to be
discovered by merely scientific test. It is not by man's plan,
however, that the elephant, with his cooperative habits, was
instituted; nor did the elephant create the termite; nor do
these superiors issue orders to their spiritual inferiors, if
inferior they be. All of us mortals are equally unprivy to
the plans of the Almighty.
On the other hand, the concerns of this earth are infinitesi
mal beside the interests which center in God. What if a
drop of water incloses an universe complete according to
the scheme we have learned to call our own universe, com
prising the solar system and earth? But the universe and
the drop of water are reduced to a par before the Infinity of
God.

The beaver builds his dam. Man makes his houses and
factories and engines and arts, industrial and fine. He does
these things with his intelligence. But he does not make
his intelligence. In a sense, the whole course of develop
ment we are tracing is the outcropping of a divine ingenuity,
and a striving of life towards Intelligence. If we are to say
that life makes intelligence, that is only another formula
for God making intelligence. Life = God, from this point
of view.
So cleverly has our earthly home been contrived that we
see so far and no further. Vision does not penetrate outside
of it. The apparent makes a tolerable system. Many are
contented with the easy philosophy that it is a complete
system. Discovering deficiencies in
it,
we are spurred on
to account for them. An aberration in the career of
a
planet
calls for
a
new sounding of the depths of the unseen. We
grasp at tools, telescopes, for this purpose. By our new
inventions we are forced to admit that worlds exist which
we had denied previously, believing that the naked eye could
see all reality. But we would look and look until we see
causes. Knowing that even our intelligence
is
borrowed,
we would search until we come to our Father, the Divine
Intelligence from which ours
is
sprung and to which
it
re
turns. Or, at least, into some such circular reasoning has
speculation ever been forced.
Apart, however, from this rather vain teleology, vain, at
least, in our more rational moods, may we hope to attain
to some conception of divine government, in its actual
working,
in
the concrete? Consider that the man hunts
the elephant and the beaver for ivory and meat and fur.
The elephant makes roads
in
the forest which man and
animals can utilize; the beaver floods dry land, making
ponds for fish and muskrats. There
is
a
very perfect con
spiracy of beings to utilize the earth.

and enforce this conclusion in the minds of optimists. Pessi
mists are hopeless customers: the more proofs of a divine
plan, the more additional conditions they posit for God to
fulfill. Satisfy one condition, they demand a new one. When
their captious ingenuity is exhausted and they are reduced
to silence, they are still unconvinced. Some men are consti
tuted void of capacity to believe. Apparently so. Really,
they are floppers : they hold out to the last ditch, and when
they seem least likely to yield, they suddenly about face
and become fanatics. Indeed, this genus is not uncommon;
but it is so unsuited to the pursuit of knowledge that it tacitly
concedes its incapacity or is satisfied with a little, amateur
growling. Who has not made acquaintance of the tourist
who finds nothing good abroad, but when he finds himself
back home suddenly discovers that there is nothing good
at home?
All that men discern or have ever discovered or unearthed
is a series of efficient causes. All that a reasonable mortal
can hope for is to extend and enlarge his knowledge or con
sciousness of efficient causes. As he progresses in spirituality,
this knowledge must vastly increase; it is a basis for spiritual
evolution. At the same time, the moral nature enlarges, and
with it a personal sense of dependence and an imputation of
personality to the laws he obeys. His knowledge of natural
law grows pari passu with this imputation of personality.
His soul, therefore, enlarges in two senses, at least, the
rational and the moral. The esthetic and religious faculties
follow the same development or movements of growth.
The fourth-dimension is much more accessible to religious
influences and to the divine concept than is the third.
Therefore, insight is greater; its population has less limita
tion, but is more conscious of its limitations, such as they
are; for it knows. The ingenuousness of the mortal, con
vinced that he knows to the outer limit of the universe, and
that beyond what he sees nothing is to be seen, disappears.

On the topic of the unseen, the spirits in heaven do not
palter with paternosters and genuflexions. The man forced
to admit the existence of a First Cause, puts it as far away
as possible. It is a logical necessity, but not a moral, per
sonal experience, save in inadequate degree, or in fantastic
ecstasy, â€”a benumbing transport of the imprisoned soul, a
camp meeting revival.
In the fourth-dimension, God draws nearer, the conscious
ness is pervaded with His omniscience; Christ can even be
glimpsed in His reality, His sacred person. A knowledge of
the ways of divine government comes to the spirit gently,
even as the falling of the dew, and then he knows, as never
before, that higher powers really rule the universe. The
universe loses its material aspect. He understands the phrase
that "material is a delusion." Material is really no de
lusion; it is a fact of a lower order; but the mentality of
persons who see material alone is a delusion, for such per
sons see only occasional and material and a few efficient
causes, but no First Cause.

Various, different forms of political society have existed,
contemporaneously or successively, resting upon a founda

been determined and effectively selected by fortuitous pre
ponderance of this or that class or type or variety of the

this political pother, no sign has supervened indicating
change in the constitution of the kingdom of God, or in His

wear a dress suit because he thinks it undemocratic. Others,
secretly attached to aristocracy, praise the dress suit as the
most democratic garb. Castes, distinctions, orders, titles of
nobility, titles military, titles scholastic, titles official, titles
everywhere are impossible to suppress in principle, although
easy of abolition in individual cases. So the guillotine does
yeoman's work.
It would appear that the fortunes of the battle of life are
foreordained to enter successively phases that are essentially
fixed, fundamental, and deep-rooted in human nature. The
idea of a permanent leveling, to the exclusion of distinctions,
is a chimera. Most of all is it a chimera that democracy, as
at present existing, is to grow ever more and more demo
cratic. The course of biological development suffices to insure
new personal differences, no matter how far the leveling
process may have appeared to go. If there be aught of cogent
in the identity of indiscernibles, as a natural principle, it
would operate to prevent the ideal of democracy from coming
true, at least, during the reign of pyknosis.
Carrying still a step further the processes of less mobile
creation, every living being strains and strives, with the re
sult of an upward tendency. It is basic to our conception of
individuality that differences arise among classes and again
among individuals of each class. Orthodox, Christian The
ology mastered right reasoning but wrong temperament.
Predestination is really a sort of chance or luck. Who was
the philosopher who reached the conclusion: Chance = God?
The fact is that every man is bound to the divine. No
matter how he errs, he can attribute his mistakes, even
crimes, to the chances of biology. The damnation of man
is strictly confined to that department. We are grateful to
biologists, in the broad sense of the term, for the discovery.
Every man knows that his innermost nature is spotless.
His life seems to be an endeavor to sweep away the obstruc

is for action, and action is to do away with obstruction and
to bring out the essentially godlike in each and every one of
us, perhaps in animals too. Many a person has been ren
dered moral by a pair of glasses that relieved irritation
throughout the nervous system. It is conceivable that a
criminal might be rendered moral by trepanning or by an
equivalent operation lower in the spinal process.
So far from our biological nature being the source of our
morality, the very opposite is the truth, for it is the imperfect
form in which the perfectible principle of life appears, at first
in utter crudeness, and then striding upward towards the
image of God. If biologists have not always seen through
the Plan, it is because they were consecrated to a specific
task and could not always see the forest for the trees.
Moral acts are doubtless useful, they conform to experience,
they build upon the past, but they are not really moral unless
they are essentially ideal, conforming to the Plan, and tend
ing towards improvement and progress. So much for the
caste system or rather the system of hierarchy.
The application of it to the spirit world will be made fairly
obvious to the reader of the Record. The chief difference â€”
and it is an important oneâ€”between the castes of heaven
and mysteries of earth is that, in the latter environment,
castes are ring fences calculated to keep out, not merely in
truders, but every one who cannot force his way in, while,
in the fourth degree, the ascending levels are so many steps
facilitating progress. It is true that the circle, in the Record,
included a family which built an exclusive palace for the
privileges of separate family life. No one could begrudge
them that ambition. Family life is the essential of civili
zation.
But, again and again, the Record emphasizes the eagerness
to help others on, to teach them the way of the higher life,
to teach the young and the old the way to reach their be
loved, to make easy the reunion of those naturally and prop

The advanced spirits feel their responsibility. That they

the Record speak:
(I 94) February 12, 1870. '"Dear Sarah, the picture
brings with it the halo it received while with us. The little
sacred face is beautiful to us, and you will love it more and
more every hour. Do not let careless eyes look upon it; keep
it for those who know and understand the pure, the good, the
great. We can say no more now. God bless you. Olin.'

(II 63) June 6, 1870. "We were all pulled and every
thing seemed very strange and uncomfortable. We could not

'Get light.' The Doctor struck a match and when the light
blazed up, the paper still rattled, but the echoes said, 'Open
window.' As soon as the blind was pulled back the paper
with its rattle was gone.
"The sensation left with us was that of great discomfort,
so great that I told my husband if such were to be repeated
it would be my last sitting, even though the paper were never
returned. They wrote a few words but gave no explanation
of the strange proceedings."
June 7, 1870. "My dear Sarah, we are here, all the circle

who were present would have injured the paper. Now we are
free from shadows. The low spirits who accompany the men
with whom Katie met early last evening, still lingered about
her and we were obliged to withdraw although we were sorry
to leave you in fear and sorrow. You know, dear sister, that
this only proves that our world is like yours, with different
spheres and different people. Your own judgment tells you
that men and women who die in sin with no desire to progress
cannot enter our world of happiness and purity. We are
often almost human. Your children express this from their
desire to remain with you, to dress in their little earthly
clothes and stand before you. Feel not depressed, be happy,
for when Katie is right, we can keep away all evil, all
shadows. Olin."
Katie was a great mediumâ€”all classes of spirits, high and
low, elect and damned, could manifest through her channel.
Much depended upon her associations and environment, at
and about the time of her seances. The elect have compul
sive power over the damned in final accounting. They have
the last word. They come off triumphant in the contest; but
the conditions must be attended to. The elect could not have
entered into that seance Katie held with the bad men. There
would have been no sense in doing so. Nothing was to be
accomplished by throwing pearls before swine or showing
pictures of angels to imps of hell. The latter may or may
not be self-obliterating; they may or may not be on the to
boggan slide to primeval slime. At the moment in question,
anyhow, they occupied some space in God's kingdom, and that
space must be respected; it exacted its own integrity.
"Space is not static. It is dynamic, potential, and kinetic.
It is a process, a becoming. Its duration as a process is never-
ending. Its intensity is limited and finite. The so-called in
finity of space is one of the capital illusions of the intellect." 2

place for the evil because they are a fact. Facts call for room.
On the other hand, room is assigned to them specifically. As
a rule, men and higher animals do not intrude when and
where they are not wanted. The exception is the beast of
prey, and his trade is war. We are not now speaking of that
war which is evolution. We are speaking of that society, be
it earthly or heavenly, which is the product of evolution. And
so, when a class of the elect has emerged, it finds its place, its
high estate; but when the elect sally forth on missions of
mercy, they take the usual risks of the slummer.
(I 73) June 12, 1870. "My dear Friend, sorrow comes
in every life at times, and when one aids and lends helping
hands to those who suffer, there is always a sweet peace in
knowing that you have not neglected such. Sorrow is fol
lowed with blessings of this kind. Do you not understand
that you can now bear sorrows and trials better than those
who live for themselves alone and think not of the beautiful
life beyond? Prof. K."
A moral advantage of belief in the future life and in knowl
edge of it stands out. The fortitude of the elect has been
more manifest under the higher spiritual auspices of Chris
tianity than among the communicants of other, less sublime
religions. When once we reach the point of a fair comprehen
sion of the dignity and mission of man as an immortal soul,
we look upon the deepest sorrow with a certain detachment,
consistent with profound sympathy. We are not, moreover,
discouraged in our personal careers by sorrows, setbacks, and
disappointments. If we believe we are right, we go ever
ahead. If we make mistakes, they can be corrected, our
course can be made ever straighter and more direct. Our
sorrows are but a corollary in the inevitable contest to which
all denizens of hard-surfaced planets are devoted.

from worm to butterfly. Such are monks in Thibet, yogi in
India, monks again in Christendom, dervishes and Druses in
Arabia, and endless begging friars and holy rollers every

of our human education would be vain, although men believe
that our civilization has been built upon it and the future
of the nation depends upon it. The prudent traveler obtains
beforehand all possible knowledge about the countries to
which he is to set out; and testimony is abundant that even
a slight preparation in the foreign language is a priceless
boon to the traveler once arrived at the destination.
If all this is true under the relatively materialistic condi
tions of the third-environment, how much stronger must it
hold for the fourth, where the spiritual traits of the third
are carried over and, as it were, incorporated into the rela
tively material features of the fourth, the long-time condi
tion-making?
A spirit who had not believed in immortality would, in the
first place, endure a painful death and awakening. The
surgeon or dentist directs and impresses upon the patient
beforehand how he is to hold himself after taking laughing
gas or ether. The patient, although unconscious, conforms
to the precedent directions and profits greatly thereby. And
so the great Healer, Jesus, tells us wisely that we should
prepare our subconscious for death. This principle has al
ways obtained the acceptance of the spiritually minded, each
according to his lights, as well before as after Christ. Witness
Socrates' discourse while waiting for the sacred ship to round
the promontory and heave in sight, on its return voyage
from Delos,â€”and then the draught of hemlock! What we
learn in consciousness profits us in unconsciousness. The
lethal is still the living. So much for the importance of
timely study of the change called death !
But the effects of foreknowledge do not stop there. It is
not still open to the agnostic, while admitting that he indeed
loses out on the experience of dying and reawakening, to
boast that he has not lost much, inasmuch as dying is a short
process, while his status in the long run is established by the
fact alone that he has been an honest man and a good citizen.

These qualifications are doubtless essential. And yet their
virtue may not come into play if obscured by an obstinate
antemortem denial of the possibility of future existence. The
correct, honest agnostic constructs no lasting barrier to his
reawakening into immortal life. Friends and other-world
humane societies will pick him up and gently awaken him
into a simple home that is only "sublimely sublimed." But
how many honest, even-keeled agnostics are there? How
many pretended "agnostics" are not dyed-in-the-wool
scoffers?
Our parallel with the taking of ether comes to our assist
ance again. The man who boasts that he is his own doctor,
and who deeply imprints upon the record of his soul: "Death
is all, immortality is a delusion" â€”that man may never
awaken or may only slowly awaken to the next life. He may
spend a very long time in adjusting himself to the new condi
tions. His whole philosophy calls for revamping. His con
ception of the universe must be remade. He probably was
satisfied with our present biological and scientific knowledge
as covering the whole ground of life-interest. If he had so far
risen above materialism as to glimpse a plan he probably
(1) thought the idea of a God was ridiculous, (2) believed
with Hackel that the whole plan was immanent in the pri
mordial material.
But this stage of mental evolution is not without promise.
The man who has advanced so far has entered already the
district of honest agnosticism and of cultural debate. He
has broken with crass materialism. If he freely acknowledges
that there is an open field of discussion as to the relative
extent of immanent or external, unseen causes, he is a useful
member of spiritualizing society, he is growing in spirituality,
and his permanent prospects in the future life are only less
than those of him whose fortunate associations and whose
impressible if not also penetrating intellect have secured for
him a knowledge of something like the right combination of

studies of the biological antecedents of heaven will go that
of the prevalence of personality throughout the unfolding
plan, which will probably lead him to a satisfactory port in
some sort of a conception of a Divine Personality, some sort
of a sympathy with the ecstasy of the primitive Christian
at his great discovery.

in unison. . . . We see God as you do, in the light of day,
in the sunshine, in the flowers, the grass, the air, in the
falling of the leaves, in all the changes of the seasons. Look
out upon the trees, and see how beautiful they are in the
change. Another season and they will come forth again,
green and fresh. So everything revives. So it is with us,
with humanity. We pass from youth to age, from age to
youth. The best illustration we can give is the change in
the leaves. They turn from bright, beautiful green to yellow,
then dry upon the ground, and their beauty seems gone. The
tree is left leafless, nothing but the dry branches. But then,
spring comes again, they are born into a new life and their
dress looks fresher and younger than ever. So with old age,
so with your Grandma. She threw off the old shell like a
butterfly and expanded into a beautiful young woman. Here
her life commenced again, she was a girl with all her youth
ful feelings and beautiful to the eyes of other angels. The
picture portrays this visibly to your eyes. My dear child,
would that some one could go forth and preach this to the

understood, so sad when used for evil purposes, which is
often done as a cloak to shield from other eyes.

We grieve to witness the griefs, the sorrows that might be

every heart is not prepared for such truths. We must abide

(Ill 238) May 13, 1871. "Sarah, my child, I remember
how depressed I used to get when here suffering. Every
thing looked so dark to me and there were times when I
really suffered from fear of death. I dreaded the dissolution
from the body and I feared the unknown hereafter. I can
not tell you how pleasantly my breath passed from the
body. I fell asleep in the arms of my wife, and when I
awoke I recognized the dear companions of my boyhood.
I was not much surprised; I was happy and at last the
vacancies of my heart were filled, almost at once. Prof.
Kenyon."
(Ill 304) July 12, 1871. "How little the world knows
of our joys! We come from a home where everything is
perfect in its adaptation to our feelings, perfect in its beauty,
in everything. Heaven is a great contrast to earth, and often
we wonder how life can seem so dear to those who inhabit
earth. Few realize the great blessings in store for them.
Perhaps it is as well, for some minds are so unevenly bal
anced, that were they to have a glimpse into this world, they
would not live their time out; and a suicide is a dreadful
calamity. These things are wisely hidden. B. F."

The last extract not only accents the importance of the
family, it illustrates the dependence of the individual on his
environment and his need of knowledge, there as well as
here. A half-view of such an incident might well inspire
some poet to compose a "Blue Bird" on the theory that the
dead are conscious only when evoked. The truth would
appear to be the very reverse : Grandpa Lewis was apparently
called from his usual occupation to this family circle; and
he was summoned not by a mortal but by another spirit
who had knowledge of the way of intermundane intercourse.

The grave has no longer any terrors for you ; those you once

You mingle with the world and hold a jewel locked in your

Katie will, we see now, although we see obstacles, go to
Europe; but that must not close this intercourse between
heaven and earth. Not long will she linger away; then she
will come back to you. The sweet assurances we give you
will be laid aside for a while; but we shall silently commune
with you. Seek us not elsewhere. We will send you mes
sages through her as we do now, and we shall bring her back
a new creature, better and purer, for having suffered.
Benjamin Franklin."
Note that the Franklin persona is co-eval with Katie. It
has been suggested that it was he who originally selected
the Fox family as appropriate mediums for the great mani
festations of spiritual power and life that broke out in
1848. Undoubtedly the Hydesville demonstration was the
most important of many that blazed forth eruptively in
various quarters of the world at about that time. It has
not been suggested that Franklin was responsible for them
outside of his own country, however. Katie was the choice,
then, of Franklin; and this is interesting, because the trans
parent little woman, sensitive to a breath and leading a
thin, uneventful life outside of her great psychocanalization,
was the last person in the world to originate a thing of
Franklinesque order. But with the demise of Katie we hear
no more of Franklin. The simple solution of the problem
is that she was the medium of mediums in some way cog

tendency or persistence of the deceased to manifest, it is
remarkable that Franklin was able to stage the great revival
so long, some eighty to one hundred years, after his death

our beautiful avenues today, and our feet have touched the
beautiful flowers in heaven's garden. We have touched the
brows of the dying and shall hold the lamps for some, in a
few hours, to light their way to happy visions. Then, when
they awake to consciousness, they will find themselves in a
beautiful place, surrounded by long lost friends dear as life
to their souls, and the greetings will come, the clasping of
hands, the gentle kisses of love and explanations. The new
born souls first think they are dreaming. This, dear Sarah,
is the first awakening. Then, another scene opens, they seek
to find their way back to their friends and homes they have
just left. Bewildered and astonished! In sadness mingled
with joy these new-born spirits listen to the explanations of
those who have been here and learned the different paths
and links between the two worlds. Soon they grow satisfied
and the soul rejoices in the glory of heaven. We often have
cause to pity many who come here without knowing this

elusive. It deals with facts which are definitive and settle
hoary, antique disputes, heal on the spot and for all time
running sores of reason hitherto refractory to every antiseptic
or argument. It closes the book of rudimentary soul-build
ing, and opens the apocalypse of spiritual destiny.
But there persist embarrassing questions, chiefly as to the
correct attitude of the persuaded spiritualist toward the un-
persuaded public. Shall the former wear the colors of
"spiritualism" in spite of the questionable histories, the gul
lible rich, the designing "mediums," the stuffy seances of
long-haired men and close cropped women, which have, not
without reason, repelled the conservative, decent public; or,
on the other hand, unwilling to lend himself to authentifica-
tion of undesirable, often degrading associations, shall he
deny that he is a spiritualist, but endeavor to spread its essen
tial truths, unembarrassed by the prejudicial introduction of
a misused appellation?
The term "psychic research" has offered an ingenious
bridge of retreat to many spiritualists who feel hampered
by public misconceptions which are more easily sidestepped
than brushed aside. Christianity, however, denying Christ,
would never have achieved its signal triumph. The name,
"spiritualist," can be made as dear as it has been despised,
if not hated. It has my vote. It reconciles the various mean
ings of the word "spirit" and proves that the logic of lan
guage is a racial logic transcending that of any individual,
be he philosopher or seer. For the spiritualist believes in
a spirit life. He believes that it transcends and survives
terrestrial life. He can even believe that every spirit has a
body of some sort. He believes that a spirit is an objective
as well as a subjective entity. He must conclude that, even
in the fourth-dimension, the relation designated as spirit:
matter is preserved, continued, or revived, the body there
being rather akin to what the soul was here, while the soul
there is a closer infusion from the divine. And, lastly, he

believes that the universe is permeated by a Holy Spirit
that was from the beginning and shall be, evermore, world
without end. All these meanings of "spirit" and others,
doubtless, are reconciled by spiritualism and find their appro
priate place in a system which the race, society, had been
creating and building into the language before it realized
what it was doing. What this system was and is we are
learning from spiritualism.
Many spiritualists wish to abolish the word "death," at
least as applied to the human species. I do not know whether
they would agree that animals "die" or not.* Probably they
admit a death for animals. And what would they do with
the statement of McConnell that some individual animals
have more soul than some individual men?
However, when men get down to brass tacks and start to
talk about the "change called death," they find the phrase
very convenient for the expression of a necessary idea, and
many spiritualists are prepared to yield assent to that word,
"death," which has received a sort of consecration. It is
foolish, just because the spiritualist believes that death is
followed by different consequences from those assigned by
materialists, to deny its existence. If there be a spiritual fact
of survival, that conclusion does not imply denial of a ma
terial fact of death. The denial of death has meaning, per
haps, as a tropical or poetic locution; but has no place in
discursive speech.
The use of old, materialistic words in a new, relatively
spiritual sense is a delicate matter. Civilization advances by
a gradual spiritualization all along its wide-flung battle
front. The new concepts involved in this progress naturally
call for new words. But they are not easily forthcoming.
We grasp back at the classics, we seek gap-fillers from foreign,
modern tongues, but, after all, as a last resort, we are com

and generally material uses, and twist them into a spiritual
connection, which makes them hard to understand by one
set of persons, while inducing another set to deny the fact
or the reality of their previous usage.
Similar vacuous battles are raging today about the words
"socialism" and "evolution."
This discussion brings me once more to "miracles." Here
again the logic which is embedded in the structure of the
language comes to our assistance. A miracle is anything
which excites wonder. Webster's New International Dic
tionary (1930) defines miracle: "an event or effect in the
physical world beyond or out of the ordinary course of
things," etc. The fundamental meaning is more simple even
than the etymological one of "wonderful" (mirari). It is
simply that of newness. That is wonderful which is new,
which "cannot be accounted for as produced by any of the
acknowledged forces of nature." The novelty at once sets
us speculating and we conclude that an event is other
worldly because it is outside of our own little world of daily
moiling and toiling. We are too busy to think farther. Our
jaws drop in wonder, but we turn back to our labors. It is
wonder, not fear, that founds religions and inaugurates the
cycle of science.
That is about as far as men often get in their exploration
of wonders, of the unusual. The unusual things or events
come to be classed together and are taken charge of by
religion. Students of sociology tell us that religion is the
fundamental science. Law, politics, medicine, science, art,
are sprung from primitive religion, and so of modern religion
itself. Constant discussion makes familiar and definite and
so far real that which was primitive "medicine." Aniline
dyes are not produced by a sorcerer but by chemical works.
Religion itself has ceased to be miraculous.
This reduction and conversion of the spiritual into the
material is an endless process. It goes on throughout ter

restrial history, and, to one looking from the warp, across the
woof of existence, it is more than probable that "the change
called death" will, in its own sweet way, make familiar and
"material" to us that which, from our present disadvantage
of view, clothes itself in the unfamiliar, the spiritual, the
miraculous.
We may, perhaps, assume that the general and combined
experience of men is stereotyped in languages. There is an
unconscious logic in the structure of our apparently spon
taneous speech which often points the way to surprising
spiritual conclusions. Social is therefore true in a sense
transcending individual experience. Hence, we may refer
back to language as having explanatory value in a higher,
symbolical sense. Words and phrases are cryptograms. The
learned reader may discover more truth in a phrase than the
writer innocently intended.
A miracle, then, is an event to the newness or infrequency
of which, happening, like the return of some meteor, but once
in a lifetime, we are unaccustomed and unadjusted.
If, from the top of the temple and before the assembled
multitude, Jesus had jumped down unharmed, the event
would have been decidedly unfamiliar and unclassifiable,
and men would have been awestruck and would have recog
nized a miracle. And He did proceed to do, in the next three
years, forty or fifty acts, chiefly in the way of healing or
of furnishing sustenance to the poor, or otherwise of diverg
ing from what men expected from the usual action of effi
cient causes; and His object apparently was to convince men
of an order of causation in nature with which they had been
hitherto unacquainted. His purpose was to shake their re
liance upon a worn-out system of causes.
The conception of God, previously fairly sublimated
among the Hebrews, was carried onto a far higher plane than
the world had yet dreamed of. It was made the vehicle, as
it were, or perhaps better, the crystallizing point, or even.

the growing point of the more spiritual era which was ushered
in by Jesus. The novel efficiencies which thus seemed to
take shape out of nothing and to account for the unaccount
able and to disturb men's satisfaction with previous inter
pretations of the familiar, must needs find a word to cover
them, for there was a new dispensation, there was a new
view of the world and of man, there was a new taste in life,
a new courage despite the moral despair of society and
despite the persecutions sanctioned by the dominant car
nality. The word "God" was adopted in the most sublime
and unitarian sense which the contemporary cults and
philosophies had contrived and imagined for it.
The further man advances, the more does he need a Logos.
The loaves and fishes, the child raised from the dead, the
wine that on the instant had been water, were awe-inspiring
events, calculated to shake men loose from hoary beliefs
which were now shown to be, in essence, superstitious. To
be satisfied with the familiar is in itself superstitious. The
fanciful explanations of everything that occurs, from the
obtaining of brass from the earth by heat to the growing
of crops by manure and to the digestion of food were at last
felt to be, in a very true sense, superstitions. Men suspected
that the cross-section of events was as unaccountable and
hence as miraculous as the long-section.
Science has accomplished two things: (1) It has demol
ished the previous familiarity with the familiar, and (2) it
has proved that the concatenation of efficient causes is in
finite, at least in comparison with our feeble comprehension.
It has at last brought us face to face with the ineluctable
acknowledgment that the familiar is as miraculous as the
unfamiliar, the old is as miraculous as the new, our depend
ence on God is as direct and unavoidable in the ripening
of the grain, the painting of the picture, the glow of the
imagination, as in the hurricane, or in the earthquake, or in
the social revolution.

The longitudinal section of life offers nothing more miracu
lous than the cross-section. The daily and the familiar are
as astounding, unaccountable, and miraculous as the hapax-
legomena of astronomy or geology. The miracle of miracles
is that anything is. The demiurge that Jesus assumed was
in order to awaken men to action and thought toward a
knowledge of the immanence and ingerence of higher powers
in all things and especially in the small, still voice within.
The master puzzle: "beside you"; "in the palace."
Such is the work of spiritualization. It is the work of
civilization and much more. We do not know whither it will
lead us. We only know that we have been given a certain
orientation. With renewed realization of the dignity of
destiny, we can return to our laboratories, purged of preju
dices, disabused of the superstitions which are largely pre
conceptions of the utilities, the applications, the limitations
of our work. We will be inclined to broaden our inter
pretations and inferences. We had condemned "evolution"
perhaps as too narrow for our use. Now we wish to bend
the most novel and spiritual processes into the evolutionary
hypothesis. We are not to be satisfied with the statement
that "God made everything." On the contrary, since every
thing is equally miraculous, we are destined to rise by a
constant study, reaching into every phenomenon, whether
ostensibly of subjective or objective order. If the realm of
science is now subsumed under the miraculous, so is the
formerly exclusive realm of the miraculous to be subjugated
by science.
Either there are no miracles, or everything is miraculous.
The choice resolves itself into a matter of taste. The
familiarity or unfamiliarity of life must not impose upon
us nor deter us from living fully and freely, nor from ran
sacking the whole realm of what is, in the search for Kingdom
Come.

on their feet again, gives them a new lease of life, and holds
the faithful to standardized confession. It is the one, great,
argumentum ad hominem.
After healing of the body follows healing of the soul. The
material and tangible announces and clears a path for the
spiritual and the more cogent. For disease or wounds or
deformities areâ€”such is human optimism â€”contrary to na
ture. Similia similibus curantur: the idea at once comes
to hand to invoke what is uncommon, extraordinary, un
usual, in a transcendent degree, to effect cure of what is un
natural, in a minor degree. Disease is unnatural, in the
sense that it is not true to type or idea, but deflects life
from its charted course. The source of the very ideas is
therefore besought to remedy these interruptions to our
thoughts and obstructions to our careers.
Evidently, under modern specialization, healing of the
body is for medicine, while healing of the mind still rests
with religion. But there is a middle district, that of the
brain, which is attended to by psychology, as a branch of
medicine.
It
is,
therefore, inevitable that efforts to increase men's
spirituality and to fit them for residence
in
the fourth-dimen
sion should begin and take
a
running start, as
it
were, by
more or less successful healing operations
in
the third. Nerv
ous disorders, epilepsy, palsy, insanity due to
a
lesion in
the brain or nervous tissue, lie close to spiritual life, in that
they impede its flow and obstruct its manifestation. Re
move the barrier, the river of life flows smoothly again.
Medicine fails to help at the point where the will and the
intellectual analysis of motives, the understanding, become
efficient. No less understanding
is
required for divine heal
ing than for medical, only
it
works behind the scenes.

insertion or dovetailing of religion into medicine is a bridge
to higher things. It is a recommendation to the purity and
elevation of the Record that it makes little case or pretense
of medical healing, while it lays all its force on teaching us,
by precept and example, the nature of life eternal.
The material origins of our human, spiritual life lie in
imperfection and are quite unsuggestive of the ideal. Striv
ing is ever upwards toward the ideal. The source of ideality
or, perhaps, better, ideality itself, seems to contain the power
of hurrying up its own processes and of removing obstacles
that stand between individual life and itself. It is pre
mature to speculate on the ultimate course and rationale of
living, but phenomena had to be. Are not these, here and

home, and how rapidly they are progressing in knowledge.
It remains to speculate as to whether their character, their
soul texture, which is built up for mortals by misfortune
and even by sin, may suffer from premature taking off. Do
they develop more sympathy, more appreciation, more knowl
edge, in many ways, at least, but less stamina, less power
to influence those men remaining in the third-dimension,
less power to return there for toil, like Dr. Franklin, a
century after his decease? Speculation along this line might
be fruitful of better understanding of spirit life.
(Ill 52) November 15, 1870. "We have looked in the
future. No clouds are over your home. The birds sing joy
ously and the sweet welcome of their tones tells us that you
will be happy and live long to enjoy life. Be happy, my
dear Sarah, rely on my promises, and you shall never be
deceived. Olin."
(Ill 77) December 6, 1870. "We sat before a pure
stream. First, I saw your future six months ahead. It was
a beautiful, peaceful landscape. Yours and George's are on
one landscape. Near George was a little darkness, a few
little clouds and hills. But they will all be overstepped and
he will stand bright and clear in successful paths. He will
have a few trials at first to endure and he must be cheerful
under all difficulties, for all will pass away and you and
all dear to you will be happy. I saw you, Sarah, at the bed
side of some sick, very sick, person. I am not permitted to
tell who, some one in your family. I saw you gliding along
safely with flowers at your feet. You must guard Willie
from disease, from too much study. We will, from time to
time, advise you and prevent much evil. Do not feel a
shadow, for all is well.

Willie. So they prattled and sang and danced and played.

We can make a mirror that reflects what we believe or
calculate will happen; but it does not help us to a knowledge
of what will happen. In the future life, it is possible to
harness a sort of apparatus to a person's destiny, which on
one hypothesis, is already in existence, although not pre
cisely enacted. Residence on earth discloses portions of this
destiny successively: that is life. The mirroring of the
future, then, depends on connecting up with some more last
ing, with some almost, if not infinite, more nearly eternal
entity or rather world of entities, than is imagined by men,
and, through a tour de force, directing that connection to
the personality of a mortal man, existing, in extenso, as it
were, in that Absolute, but in the third-dimension only in
the vain and fleeting present.

another member of the family: "We are not often permitted
to give this information but there is no harm in our fore
shadowing it to you in this case, but do not repeat it nor
make remarks about it outside of the family. Dear Sarah,

for we have just witnessed the opening of the two buds
which were emblematical of 's future. We may never
be able to do this again, therefore, we implore you not to
repeat it to any one. Olin."

sweet assurances we give you will be laid aside for a while;

(IV 69) June 11, 1875. "My dear friend, before the
close of next week you will have a very dark hour, but we
will tell you in time so that you may smile through your
tears. All will be well and all will come out well. The
clouds will pass away and all will be bright. It is well to
have this warning, or you might sink in spirit. J. B. T."
(IV 72) June 18, 1875. "The warning of some unpleas
ant event had been given us on June 11 and predicted to
occur before the end of the following week. June 1 1th was
on Saturday, and we watched each succeeding day knowing
in our hearts that the warning had a meaning. Saturday, the
18th, came, a disagreeable, stormy morning; noon came, and
still all was well. In a few hours, the last day of 'the next
week' would expire, the time for the unusual anxiety would
have passed. While I was hoping they had made a mistake,
some one rushed in and said that an employe of ours (an
intelligent, capable man, but addicted to strong drink) had
stumbled in an unfinished building at the other end of our
block and fallen two stories among iron beams, and been
taken up, and was then being carried away by the police, in
a dying state.5
"Instantly I recognized the warning. That evening, as
early as practicable, George and I went up to Katie's room
and the subjoined was written:
"My dear Sarah and George, We were with you today
when the announcement was made and we were sure that you
would think of our predictions. Well, Sarah, it has come,
that which would annoy and disturb you but be for the best.
Now, my dear Sarah, look for the sure completion of these
predictions and it will come and you will be happy. All is
well. Olin."

edge of the open excavation or cellar in 59th Street, as I happened to pass
that way. A hotel with iron facade had been begun, but work had been
suspended long previously. Afterwards, all the massive ruins of this abor

liam under your eye this summer. Do not let him go away
unless he is accompanied with some one who will watch him
as carefully as yourself. We speak to you, Sarah, in this
sentence, exclusively. When dark hours come, and there
will be some very dark, bear in mind that we have looked
well into the future and see that you will come out bright
as the brightest diamond. B. Franklin."
"Willie was just leaving for or had already gone, alone,
to Harvard College for preliminary examination. Naturally,
when I read the preceding letter, I took alarm at once. The
pencil, in Katie's hand, wrote immediately as follows: 'Do
not feel worried about your son, William. He is safe and
well, and we will have a care over him, but just give him this
warning: he must not go bathing; he must not ride wild
horses; he must not go for long walks alone. Be so kind as
to send him this message; it will save you much sorrow and
him much suffering. Do this and all will be well. J. B. T.'

"Brother Olin and Sister Emeline announced their presence
and I enquired how Willie would get along with his examina

"
'Dear Sarah, he will get along splendidly. Olin and I
will stand by him, yes, and give him confidence. We will
put words in his mouth, and do more for him than his
memory can.'

shall come to him while we are near him and he will return
to your arms as he left you. Olin." 8

(IV 204) February 9, 1886. "We had a meeting in the
Hall. We were all together and we looked long into your
affairs to see how things were going. We see a cloud ap
proaching for the proprietor (business partner). You will be
a little disturbed but it will end well and for your good.
Changes are coming very soon. Keep good courage. . . . Mr.
Vanderbilt wishes me to tell you that he is trying to bring
about a change for you all, in this house, â€”a change for
your immediate good. He is always thinking of doing good,
and will always feel grateful for having been introduced to
Dr. Benjamin Franklin and others of our circle. . . . Some
one is coming to join us soon, not in this family or Katy's,
but some one you all know. Olin and the circle."
(IV 282) March 31, 1886. "Your little Leila was with
you yesterday morning. Olin assured the dear, anxious child
that no harm would come to you and that your eyes were
not being hurt. The love of a child is great here and so is
the love of every dear friend and relative. It is the great
link between earth and heaven. A child's love remains al
ways childlike. You see it in Leila's fear that you were
going to be hurt yesterday.
7 I do not know a fulfillment of this prediction, unless it be the death
that occurred four or five years later, alluded to further on.
8 In the following summer, July, 1886, I took my first trip to Europe,
and have since then altogether passed nearly eight years in European resi
dence. As to the preliminary prediction, the occupation after two months,
I recall no definite fulfillment unless it was an opening that came about
that time, to go into business out West. The European manticism more
likely looks to my son.

Men do not know, when they arise in the morning, what
is going to happen during the day. There may be various
engagements for the day, but they are of a competitive
nature. They are duels or combats. Even the grand march
of the ballroom is an ordeal. They would not have been
appointed, had it been known beforehand how they would
turn out, for then they would have been supererogatory. The
essence of life in the third-dimension is precisely the struggle
of it. It was the deep-seated conviction that Darwin was
right in this matter that won for him his epoch-making,
world-wide influence. And this was, perhaps, as far as he
cared to draw inferences from his observations, or, at least,
put himself on public record.
Patently a life which is one of ingrained prevision must
fail on the side of struggle. If we know how everything is to
turn out, we are mere spectators, not actors. If the fourth-
dimension environment is thus essentially merely a parquet

before which a drama is played, then its habitues, desiring
to contend, must needs hark back to the third, where, per
chance, their prevision is less and they may enter the lists
for the one party or the other. One can imagine that, like
some high-toned lawyers, they refuse to champion a cause
which seems to lead to retrogression. If they have any busi
ness, it is that of spiritual progress, all along the line,â€”
progress for you and for me.
Even at home in the fourth-dimension, they do not have
the day's panorama forced upon them beforehand. They
come and go, apparently at will, like the rest of us. Also
there are a "now" and a "then." It is only when they will
to do so that they abandon the "now" for the "then." The
difference between the environments is thus conceivable as
one of degree. They see further than we do, but, as Frank
lin insists, even their view is limited. Relatively, by small
effort, they see the immediate future for mortals. But if
they wish to get an idea of a man's whole life, its tenor and
outcome, they make elaborate preparations. That is the sort
of struggle they may practice. They study and watch for
his future in a flowing stream, or a deep pool, or they culti
vate a garden of flowers dedicated to him and inspect how
it blossoms and how it prospers. They are past masters in
the analogies of nature; they foster the fine arts of symbol
ism, for of it is to them the universe compact. Ignorance of
the future is essential to our lives.
Further into the mystery of futurity we cannot enter. We
know that we are immortal and that, after the change called
death, we may be qualified to make limited predictions. For
immortality is not all of a piece. The kind we inspect and
hypostatize will not last forever. We shall be, it would seem,
a step nearer to that totality where it is unnecessary to space
out life in order that it be comprehensible. Is not that
already much for us to know? Franklin thinks it is.

loved soul is about to enter the portals of everlasting life.
Time is uncertain. Your Ma."
This letter of Ma's seems to fulfill, in a degree, the promise
contained in the previously cited one of Franklin's. The
idea is advanced that ancient spirits cooperate in forecasting
the future. One imagines that such spirits must have an
infinitely greater acquaintance with the timeless totality of
things, to which I alluded above. Its study has perhaps been
their capital occupation, time out of mind. Such is the
nature of the process which we call "generalization." It lifts
us out of the temporal into the eternal. Every scientific
classification, every true observation, raises the thinker a
notch nearer the power possessed by the Ancient of Days of
knowing all things, unhampered by time.
And we are impelled to ask whether these time-sanctified
spirits be not, ultimately, in some sense, resolved into the
eternal texture of things: whether of them be not justified
the vision of the Bluebird, the sleeping souls reawakened by
the thoughts of mortals. Only it must be something very
different, this sleep which is rather an eternal awakeness, an
unceasing vigilance, a tireless and masterful consciousness.
Conceivable is
it,
however, that these supersouls possess
power to contract and to unify or to dichotomize themselves
to the extent of creating points of contact with those who are
still clothed
in
the remnants of temporality. Maeterlinck

is
permissible to one
who would achieve literary success.

There are students of the psychic who claim that signs of
this sort may even be displayed in the third-dimension.
In these last pages of the Record, we are granted a swift,
penetrating glance deep into the nature of prediction. Meta
physicians who have labored and cudgeled themselves on the
subjects of time and space and predictions have doubtless,
often unconsciously, been inspired from a psychic source
similar to the one at which we are here quaffing. The
thoughts that encircle the globe and permeate thinking soci

haps always.

RELIGION 311
(i) Sermons
(II 94) June 29, 1870. "Sarah, you are to us what chil
dren are to their parents. The child goes to its mother fret
ful and complains. The mother takes her child in her arms
and tries to soothe it. The child is good and quiet for a
while, but comes again and again, complaining. The mother
whose love is so great, wearies not, but takes her child aside
to cheer it; her patience never exhausts. So it is with you,
O children of earth! You who put your trust in us, come
to us, we weary not! Complain to us; we hear you and will
comfort. Seek us in sorrow, we will give you peace. The
tears we will wipe away with our garments. The sick hurt
we will make glad (to all who believe).
"But on the other side, when men are perverse and seek
no comfort but that which the world can give, we cannot
approach them to lift them up, neither can we bless them.
"You are indeed blessed, and this circle who watch over
and guard you, will never let dark clouds obscure your sky
of happiness. Be happy! All is well! I know that all is
bright above and below. New flowers are beginning to bloom
in Katie's mother's home, some day to be hers ! Are you not
happy? God bless you! Olin."
(IV 261) June 1, 1871. Autograph letter of Olin: "My
dear Sarah, this is the first day of June and our family have
taken possession of our palace in the Garden of Eden. We
occupy different apartments and can be by ourselves when
we desire. There are chapels in our palace where we can
silently worship and meditate. . . . Flowers are the per
fumes of our atmosphere, the incense of our walks. ... In
such sweet signs our thoughts flow on in golden currents,
there to trace a bright flower or withered leaf. We mark
these symbols and if they are bright and fair our souls rejoice
and we go on in gladness, feeling that our beloved ones on
earth are safe. Today is a bright and holy day for us, we

have reached the goal of our desires and like one family we
shall live to all eternity. . . . We cannot say now, 'Where
are the friends we used to love? Where are the joys of
earlier years?' All, all are here."
"I will close with a few remarks from one higher in intel
lect than myself:
"The theories of Voltaire no longer exist, and if the world
is not as good as it might be, it has become much better than
it was. Evil is a delusion. Take pride in good and never
despond. Leave through life the gift of pardon in the path
way of every erring mortal whose earthly hopes are crushed
but still looks up to heaven. A smile of forgiveness from you
will perhaps be a star to cheer and comfort; and for every
joy you give we will give unto you doubly.
"Earth has many trials. We pity the poor outcasts. God
gives them two paths to bring them back to Him. Love and
suffering both are hard. Those who tread them feel their
feet pierced, but through tribulation and patience reach at
last their journey's end and find peace. It is not for us to
point out two roads, marked, the one to good and the other to
evil, and simply say, 'Choose!' We must, as Christ did,
point out the paths that lead from the latter road to
the former, so that the misguided and erring may be led
back.
"Jesus was full of compassion for all human passions and
he loved to alleviate those wounds. This he said, 'Much
shall be forgiven thee because thou hast loved much,'â€”a
sublime pardon. Why should we refuse the helping hand to
those whom we meet bleeding from the evil of a long career?
Why should we refuse to dress their wounds? Mortals must
not be more strict than Christ. The child is small, but he
contains the germ of a man. The brain is small, yet it is
linked with the immortal mind; the eye a mere speck, yet it
takes in leagues.
"Judge not by appearances. The rough nature contains

the diviner part. Blessed are those who help to cultivate that
spark of goodness. Olin, Circle."
We note the frank declaration of the importance of sym-
bology in the fourth-dimension. Evil is the negation, the
absence of good. The sentiments of the "one higher than I
am," are expressed from his own point of view; for forgive
ness can only flow from one in authority; it is not valued
and loses its efficacy if affected by an equal or by an inferior.
The natural inference is that every mortal should try to cul
tivate that spiritual largeness which entitles him to forgive.
Forgiveness would be manifested in good advice, in an appeal
to intelligence, that stepping-stone to spiritual life. "Why
should we refuse?" therefore, refers to spirits. The fact that
the next sentence enjoins similar conduct upon mortals does
not overcome in the preceding the imputation to spirits of
duty of forgiveness. Mortals may and do grow spiritually
and may, in the proper case, also exercise forgiveness. But
they should sedulously avoid presumption.
(Ill 213) April 16, 1871. "My dear Sarah and George:
We are all here this bright morning. If you are not happy,
it is not that we have neglected you in our prayers. We
have prayed for your happiness and success and we feel that
our endeavors to place flowers in your paths have not been in
vain. We have been with you, noting every act of your lives.
The room is full of saints who were once like you, human and
finite, weak and sensitive.
"There are no shadows on the sky of your history. No
sorrowful hands are uplifted, no flowers are closed in grief
for you, my dear Sarah. The sun shines upon you, the birds
sing for you, and hope cheers your heart as the star cheers
the lone watcher. You hear not the soft strains of music
as they float through the air. '
A requiem, soft and low, sol
emn and sweet is now being sung for a soul just being born
into Paradise. Would that your ears were permitted to
hear, your eyes permitted to see. Death would be life and

earth would have few charms. How wonderful are the ways
of Providence, how wise; and yet how few are the persons
who see as they should ! They send up mournings for those
who have gone before and bow not with resignation to the
will of God. Oh, learn to say, Thy will be done, Father,
not mine!' Then will the heart become spiritual, the eyes
see with an inner vision, and nothing seem strange under the
sun. Olin."
(Ill 240) "Good morning, Sarah and George: . . . We
shall go by ourselves to the palace after leaving you. I
would like one, if not half as large, for myself. I shall have
to wait my time and work for
it,
so
I
will be patient.
Prof. K."
May 14, 1871. "After reading the above
(a
letter from
Olin written by Katy's left hand), we looked at the paper
on the bureau which was entirely blank when
I
placed
it
there. No human hand had touched this paper since, and
still upon
it
was written in
a
clear, beautifully round hand,
the following letter:
"My dear children, would that
I
could explain to you the
great difficulties we have in coming to you and performing
the work we have made so many efforts to do. The storm
and clouds of life will pass. Look up with serene faith to
the Great Giver and be glad. We confess our eagerness to
lift the veil and show you the vistas of Eternity. We watch
the workings of your inner feelings, where hope golden hues
the future, and we long to make all clear to your vision.
Reason and Faith are often antagonistic and conflicting.
The one
is
shrouded in darkness and doubt by the mysteries
of Providence, while the other
is
serenely hopeful. Reason
is
driven from her throne by the tempests which drift across
the sea of human destiny, while Faith soars above all obsta
cles and reaches an abiding place within the veil. Reason
gropes and stumbles, while Faith undismayed ascends her
watch tower. To the eye of Reason many things are dark,

but Faith sees through all the dark shadows and the flowers
go on blooming.
"My children, respect those who visit you, unseen. Their
eyes are upon you, their ears hear you. It is Sunday morning,
the busy noise is hushed.
"How beautiful is charity! I pity the poor wretch whose
life hangs on a thread, who today is shut out from the light
in his prison cell. He who has no temper to overcome and
is by nature good and amiable, is not entitled to so high
encomium as he who battles against his evil passions. Oh!
I pity the poor outcast and my prayers are for his deliv
erance.
"My children, the morning is bright and full of peace. Let
your hearts be glad. The little ones are here. Their pure
robes have touched your white dress. We love to see you in
pure garments. It shows that you know that our eyes behold
you. We go now to fulfill our duties in the heavenly land.
The harps are sounding; voices are calling us. Farewell.
Benjamin Franklin."
(IIl 246) May 19, 1871. "Again we are with you. Our
spirits come without a shadow. The air is full of the whis
perings of angels and we know that you feel our blessings
for we breathe them softly upon you and leave your souls
brighter. We are happy to come in your presence. Oh, how
soft and genial is the atmosphere! The birds warble sweet
notes for you on earth, while ours fill the air with echoes
from distant lands. We are so happy! We would not ex
change with you, and yet you have everything to make you
happy, everything to make life seem pleasant. The world
is beautiful in all seasons. Winter with her icy covering, her
pure white covering, is beautiful. Autumn with her chang
ing colors is beautiful. How glorious when the leaves fall
to the ground and the winds sigh mournfully through the
trees as if sighing for the departed beauty. God has made
life a study, nature a still greater study. Enjoy every day

of your lives, and, dear Sarah, today when you go out I will
speak to you in every beautiful flower you behold. Dear
Sarah and George, I have looked in your future, and there
are no dark rivers between you and success. Olin."
(IV 247) May 21, 1871. "My dear Sarah, we are all
here this beautiful morning. Hushed is the noise outside,
everything breathes peace, and we come out of our heavenly
homes sanctified by the holy atmosphere through which we
have come, free from sin, free from all human frailties. If
we can leave you more peaceful, we shall feel repaid and
know that another gem is added to our crown of happiness.
We wish you to keep the first of June fresh in your memories.
We are now perfectly satisfied with our palace. If your
imagination can picture us in it when we take possession,
we shall be rejoiced. But, oh Sarah and George, let your
imagination be of the purely beautiful! . . . Every flower
in your future home is open and blooming in great beauty.
The sky is not dark with trouble and disappointment.
"Tell dear Em that I am with her. I see how troubled
she sometimes is. I don't like delays, myself, but I think all
will come out right. Of course she must expect some dis
appointments. You need not repeat the last sentence. Some
minds never rationally accept anything of a saddening char
acter, but at once imagine evil, therefore we, as often, refrain
from predicting the future. Olin."
(IV 174) January 19, 1886. "I never feel troubled when
I glance, (with the aid of Dr. Franklin) into the future. I
can quickly tell if there are to be unhappy changes. Be
happy; I have reason to tell you this.
"The children are with quite a gathering of people in a
grove of ferns. Mr. Vanderbilt was with them when I left.
I have been on a voyage and glanced at them as I came by.
Well, you see that we have our happy enjoyments. Love
is a beautiful chain; it links heaven and earth; by it the souls
of all nations are united and beat in unison. Love is God's

soul is glad; let yours be likewise. Olin."
(IV 407) February 24, 1891. "We have all a deep in
terest in you and yours. Some day, we shall all meet here.
We will have circles of our own in the palace of truth, in the
Garden of Paradise, under the drooping willow surrounded
with flowers, perfumes from heaven's lamps. Yes, George
and Sarah, we shall have our souls' desires here. These
meetings are so valuable to you and to us. Why, only pause
and think: When earthly care is ended, when you come here,
we will all stand at the entrance of this summer land and
you will know us. We will clasp hands, exchange greetings,
and then commences life immortal. This is a great study,
George and Sarah, and our world is a world of great change.
We are never, never at a loss for something to do. You will
come prepared to meet all, just as we have pictured it to
you. You will not stand and look in vain for familiar faces,
for friends to greet you, and, at the same time, you will not
realize you have left earth. You will, for a while, think that
you are in the most beautiful place on earth, for a few hours,
but oh, my children ! the transcendent beauties of your home
here will overpower you. You will be exquisitely happy.
"My dear children, there is no death without a new birth.
The glorious spiritualism has been such an unlooked-for
blessing to many great minds, such a surprise to many of the
clergy. You will shine forth forever like the stars in the sky.
Isaac T. Hopper."

tion, coming from a high authority, is not profuse, like the
writings of Olin, but is sufficiently explicit:
October 1, 1871. . . . "My dear children: This is our last
Sunday morning (before Katie's departure for Europe,
October 7, 71) and we are all gathered here to speak a fare
well word, not farewell, either, for we shall be with you.
Sunday morning, and all is well. The flower we spoke of is
still unfolded and is a sign of peace and happiness for Katie.
Oh, never again touch the wine cup to your lips. We feel
that the change has come. Go over the big waves, for the
mighty change has come. Rejoice, oh ye children of earth,
rejoice! We do!
"Again we meet. We have accomplished much for you,
my daughter and son. We have given you tokens by which
you shall recognize beloved faces in a multitude of angels.
You will not have to pause to ask, 'Which is my child?'
'Where are my children?' Where is Olin ?' No! No! You
will find them all and satisfied you will dwell with them
in their palace. Our work is not completed. We shall look
forward with pleasure to the time when we will be able to
renew it. Our hands will be ready. Our hearts will rejoice in
the renewal of these meetings; will yours also? If shadows
fall upon you, my children, look not upon the dark side,
remember the unseen throng about you, catch the blessings
as they fall, and lay up in your hearts the truths we have
given you. Let them rest in the most sacred part of your
souls, so that when you lie down at night you can close your
eyes to live upon them.
"Remember all, and let not your faith become tarnished
by doubts. We shall draw near you after the toils of the
day and silently commune with you. Many a wayside flower
will fall in your footsteps and we will guide you. There is
not time for us to commence another manifestation of our
power. We must wait until the time comes. It will come
and you will be better prepared to receive it.

"Well done! good and faithful children, my daughter and
son, true in spirit, true to your faith, true in all things,â€”
we bless you. Daily you become nearer and dearer to me.
When trials and obstacles obstruct your way, there will be
no one in the Kingdom of Heaven who will work more lov
ingly for you than I. Then with this assurance, rise up daily
and with strong hearts perform your duties, never swerving,
never drooping. All is well,â€”we bless you, bless you for
your protection of this poor child, who, God knows, has been
more sinned against than sinning.
"There will be no more appointments, but if the oppor
tunity offers we will speak; if not we shall feel that all that
could be done has been done, and we are thankful for the
blessing that we have been able so freely to bestow. We can
say no more; our duties call and we must depart. Joy and
peace go with Katie and all good angels guard her on her
journey. My children, once more I say, 'God bless you.
Farewell.' My power is exhausted. Franklin."

June 15, 1870. "My dear, sweet sister. Marriage here is
purely holy. Yes, when two loving hearts come together on
earth, and are separated, prevented from marrying there, in
heaven those souls seek each other and are eternal com
panions. Olin."
June 23, 1870. "Sarah, in answer to your question, your
query. There is a union of souls here like marriage. Here
the true are mated. No uncongeniality in this home, this
land of rest. Families are singled out just as on earth, only
without earthly desires. Pure and holy, they live and enjoy
their lives better than when on earth. Those who do not

earth, here all is made up to them and they are met by the

Land find their crown of glory, their wreaths of happiness.
They leave the withered flowers, the sick scenes, and we
show them their new happiness, and they live again their
lives as earth lives, only sanctified, and all is made clear.
Olin."
March 10, 1886. "My grandpa Lewis had two wives.
The first, my Ma's mother, died about sixty-five years ago,
and he forty years after, and the second wife fourteen years
after him. They were both superior women, but very unlike.
His attachment to the first wife seemed to be with him and
a part of his life to the end. I asked grandma Langworthy
about that family relation now. She wrote:
'"I am going to give you a reality. I want you to know
exactly how these things are. Grandpa's wife prepared his
home for him and received him, although she had her own
companion separate from grandpa. Grandma Sarah.'
"
May 6, 1886. "Uncle Albert, Rev. A. G. Palmer, had
made an appointment with Katie for the following morning.
'Aunt Sarah' was his first wife and died forty and more years
ago. I promised to go with him to Katie's. The pencil
added, 'I think Sarah better be shy tomorrow, and say little
while the other wife is there. Charlie Foster.'
"There are some minds so narrow that they cannot enter
tain the idea of more than one jewel. His Sarah " was his
jewel, his wife is his helpmate. There is a great difference,
be it first or second. . . . Sarah told me that she longed to
have her husband with her. She is more like a young girl
waiting for her lover. Think of it allâ€”here she is tonight
telling Olin how happy she will be tomorrow when she talks
with Albert and hears his voice. She is drawing him nearer
to her. He's nearing the home she has prepared for him.
