  		    4525.    Sadaf Probable NDE     6/27/2018.    Probable NDE 8584.      From Iran. Original in Persian, translated to English by Amir.    When I was suffocating, I felt really sick.  Then I saw two people, but could not see their faces clearly. One of them was a woman and the other one was a man. The man was very tall, brilliantly very white, and was standing at the foot of my bed. They told me to, 'Get ready to go together. We came to take you.' 
  Probable NDE during nose surgery.   

    4524.    Matthew H Mother NDE     6/23/2018.      Secondhand NDE 16096.            When she fell onto the bed she said her spirit left her body. She told me that she was sitting in the front seat of the ambulance and that there was a female driver. This was later verified. She told me the road they went down and what hospital they came to. This was also verified. She also told me that her spirit was walking through the hospital, came into the waiting room, and saw us sitting there. She named everyone who was there and told me that we were eating Subway sandwiches and cookies.  
  Mother's NDE with shared NELE from family.   

    4523.    Daphne B NDE     6/21/2018.      NDE 8583.       From Canada     Back in the Void I wondered what to do next. I wanted to make sure that this really was the void. I went to the left and then to the right. Then I went up farther, but everywhere I went I was just there. There was no way to reference where I was. I could only see darkness in 360 degrees. As I looked into the darkness I had a feeling that I was glowing but I couldn't be sure. As I looked into the blackness, I would catch glimpses of a blue grid but the blue was so dark that it seemed to blend in with the blackness. I thought of all the places I could go and all the things I could do. 
  NDE due to bilateral pneumonia and kidney failure.   

    4522.    Stephanie B Possible NDE    6/12/2018.      Possible NDE 8433.            When I left, he told me I was part of the 'world family' and that he was honored to help. Later when I had access to get things from out of my vehicle, I couldn't believe it when I saw the damage. The front of the vehicle was practically molded into a tube from all of the violent rolling. Both doors had been removed and the entire wheel and axle (had be sheared completely off) were sitting on the drivers seat. The front windshield was cracked to such a tiny degree that it looked like a mosaic. Stink bugs were all over my things. Keys were torn out of one of my keyboards. My sound bar was bent, the subwoofer gashed. Those were just some items in the trunk. All of this yet I was fine, with only a few bruises. Everyone told me it was a miracle and they'd never seen anything like it. I was in a parking lot a few miles from the location of the accident and a man says to me 'we're going to save your life today'.
    Possible NDE from a car accident. Although dead when arrived at the hospital, it is impossible to say that the experiences occurred during the time she was dead. What is very intriguing is the multiple timelines she encounters. 
  
    4521.    Debra P Probable NDE     6/10/2018.      Probable NDE 8573.            I actually stood next to the surgeon and the emergency room doctor as they spoke. I stood next to the surgeon as he performed the surgery. The next thing I knew, I found myself in a waiting room. It was not gray, white or blue, but a mixture of those colors. I knew I wasn't alone, but I felt rather than saw anyone. 
  Probable NDE associated with surgery and other mystical experiences.   

    4520.    Oscar NDE     5/31/2018.      NDE 8568.       From Uruguay. Original in Spanish, translated to English by David.     After the operation, I told the doctor everything about how he was proceeding and the instruments he requested. I had a cardiac arrest at the time of the surgery, and another arrest after surgery. This was where I told him how he proceeded to cut my sternum and do heart massaging by hand. I also told him that an electrical outlet wasn't working, and they changed to a different one to use something like a polisher with a cog wheel.  
  NDE associated with cardiac arrest during surgery.   

    4519.    Charlie J Probable NDE     5/22/2018.      Probable NDE 8565.            Behind this large desk was a man who was intimidating and very powerful. On his right had was very large ring. The ring had inscriptions which I do not remember, but for some reason the ring stood out as something very important. This man and the desk were in the center of the room. I do not recall anything on the desk. 
  Probable NDE following heart attack.   

    4518.    Gary F NDE     5/17/2018.      NDE 8564.       From Australia.     I was above a sky filled with individually colored drops like the candy of liquorish or differently colored candies with chocolate inside. There were millions and millions of them coming from the right to the left above me and filling the sky. Actually, they were the sky. Athough I was far above, I could see each one individually as they were pushed or making their way across the sky. I could have watched them for hours and hours. 
  NDE due to pulmonary embolus with somewhat atypical content.   

      4517.    Richard G NDE     5/15/2018.      NDE 8562.       From Canada     At that moment there was no chance to manipulate the answer. You had to tell the truth. It felt like my soul answered this question. I answered, "I love God with all of me." Then I sent these feelings of love to our Creator. After a moment my soul received Love from the other side! It was so huge that if God's love were the ocean, my love would have been one drop of water. It felt like if I were to have moved any closer to that love, it would have absorbed me! 
  NDE due to unconsciousness due to apparent cardiac origin.   

    4516.    Fatma A Possible NDE     5/11/2018.      Possible NDE 8560.       From the UK.       I notice that I was dressed in a peach-pink silk dress with pearls and diamonds. I was wearing golden shoes, accented with pearls. I gazed around the interior of the palace and saw many doors. I opened one of the doors and found myself in a huge bathroom made of shiny, cream-colored marble. The bathtub was round, with water in it and it was full of floating lotus flowers. I also saw a beautiful, ivory silk dress with decorative pearls and diamonds on it. I was amazed. I then made my way outside of the palace to explore some more. First I saw a huge multi-coloured bird sitting in a tree. It had a big beak and a feathered crest like that of a cockatoo. The bird spoke to me, saying, 'Peace be upon you.' I also saw a tree with gigantic multi-coloured flowers. I went over to that tree and felt that I could communicate with it.  
  Remarkably beautiful NDE vs NDE-Like Dream.   

    4515.    Jeff H NDE     5/10/2018.      NDE 8559.        Exceptional experience.    The things I was shown have been more like choices that were made when the options were fairly limited. The feeling at the time of the choice was simply 'This feels right. This feels like the right thing to do.' With that feeling is a sense of peace, and calm. I was told that if I were to continue in this life, that it would be unlikely that I would reach my potential. However, it seemed clear that starting over was a wild card and I was not shown anything about that. I remember meeting other people, and I get the feeling that these were people who had lived here and were there to help me decide what to do. 
   Remarkable NDE because as a child he was shown his future so he could decide whether to come back or not.   

    4514.  See #4575  

    4513.    Paige V NDE     5/6/2018.      NDE 8557.            I was sucked backward into a gray tunnel. There was a flash of white light and then I was in the sky. The sky was blue and there were no clouds. I couldn't smell, taste or breathe, and I had no sensation of touch. I felt incredibly peaceful and calm; it was the most wonderful feeling I've ever experienced.
  NDE at age 14 due to being choked.   

    4512.    Evelyn D NDE     5/2/2018.      NDE 8556.            I began to rise above the ceiling and then I went into another realm. There was a lot of light. A young woman with long hair dressed in a beautiful, flowing whitish-blue gown was there close to me. She emanated complete, loving kindness and I thought she must be an angel. She communicated with me through our thoughts, not by speaking. There was light behind her and I was so drawn to that light that I began floating toward it. 
  NDE due to seizure associated with fever at age 6.  Shared 59 years later.  Remarkable awareness during NDE of what would be her future vocation.   

    4511.    Natacha P NDE-Like     4/27/2018.      NDE-Like 8551.       Exceptional Experience.  From France.  Original in French, translated into English by Camille.     This light Being was so full of love and was already magnificent and grandiose. But in his reassuring form as an angel, he seemed to reach an even greater level of grandeur. I came back down very quickly to the reality of our discussion when I was told that the time had not come for me to pass through the door. To convince me of it, he showed me my two sisters whom I loved more than anything in the world. I saw all those moments that make and create links on our earth and knew I would not want to break those links for anything. But here is the thing, where I found myself, the door of God was more Love, more real, and more attractive than all the craziest dreams I could have wanted here on earth.   
  Remarkable NDE-like STE.   

    4510.    Brian H STE     4/25/2018.      STE 8554.       Exceptional Experience.     Most of the encounter and talk took place on a beautiful alien planet. The landscape had with a 500 foot tall tree in an open plains. There was a river and beautiful storm in the background with violet lightning. There were many strange, beautiful plants and insects, the likes I've never seen anywhere. She said we could explore this world someday. It had a thick atmosphere but low gravity. Angee was 15 feet tall, beautiful and stunning to my eyes. Her eye color was gold and they emitted light like the sunrise. There was not a negative tone to her speech or to any feelings she expressed or any negativity to anything I felt. Her speech was far more eloquent than I could ever attempt to imitate. She also emitted a soft, light-glowing hue from behind her. I was given the impression she could appear as anything to convince me of her status to convey messages from our Creator. 
  Remarkable and detailed STE.   
  
    4509.    Kit S NDE     4/20/2018.      NDE 23285.       Exceptional Experience.     I understood that I had to leave this wonderful place. Before I left, I saw lines of people. They were gay and straight, different colors, different religions, some were handicapped, some very young, and some who old. These people were all holding hands, showing love and forgiveness towards one another.  
  NDE due to brain hemorrhage.   

      4508.    Randall J  NDE     4/19/2018.      NDE 8548.            I became aware of 'everything', my position on the table, the movement of the earth.  I was also as though I wasn't dissolving, but I was disconnecting or becoming unsynchronized with the universe.  I was aware of everyone around me and what they were doing.  I was incredibly calm.  I remember them calling for the defibrillator.  I remember the computer voice giving them instructions and ending with 'begin CPR'.  
  NDE due to heart attack about three months ago.   

      4507.    Nasreen NDE-Like     4/17/2018.      NDE-Like 8544.        Non-Western experience From Iran.  Original in Persian, translated to English by Amir.    Suddenly, I found myself floating in the sky. It was a very beautiful scene. Below me was a very beautiful and calm sea. I saw beautiful, white clouds in a sky that was a nice blue color. This scenery was so clear and vivid, beyond anything that I had ever experienced. The air was very fresh and nice. I felt completely safe and was enjoying the whole experience.  
  No imminent life-threatening event, but very NDE-like from being very ill with flu and diabetes.     

    4506.    James R NDE    4/14/2018.      NDE 8545.            I was in a state of suspended animation and a state of bliss. Then a brilliant white hand came over my body and I was amazed at how bright, calming and euphoric I felt along with looking at how clear the finger print lines were at the bottom of his fingers to his palms. Then I was going to ask and before I did it was revealed to me my question, which was why is everything the way it is. I remember the answer was so simple.
    NDE due to being shot in heart with nail gun.   

      4505.    Michael L NDE     4/11/2018.      NDE 8543.            I was totally calm. There were several people in green gowns who were working around my body on the operating table. I DISTINCTLY remember marveling at the thin, glowing, silver 'cord' leading from my solar plexus down to the body on the table. It was stretched very thin, that it started to wonder what would happen if it broke.   
  NDE due to cardiac arrest during surgery.   

    4504.    Bill S Possible NDE     4/9/2018.      Possible NDE 8542.       Secondhand Possible NDE.     Then she asked what they were doing and he said, 'Nothing, they were just really happy.' He said my dad was wearing his regular clothes, but with slippers. My Grandma was in a dress and shoes. Then he said, ''Then I had to leave and Dad said, 'Tell everyone I said hello.'' 
  Possible NDE during surgery with general anesthesia from sister of a mentally disabled brother.   

      4503.    Audra L NDE     4/5/2018.      NDE 8541.       From the UK.     I'm suddenly falling down a hole that's just a little bit wider than my body. As I'm falling, I'm scrabbling on the crumbling inner walls of this hole for something to hold onto. It smelled like tar and I could feel how rough it was against my fingers. I couldn't see anything below me or above me. There was this rocky dusty substance that was flying all over the place, especially in my face. I couldn't breathe and I started shouting, 'Help me, I can't breathe!' But the more I shouted, the faster I fell.
  Frightening NDE due to seizure.   

    4502.    Peter U Probable NDE     4/1/2018.      Probable NDE 8538.        From Australia.    I felt like I had separated from my body and was looking down upon myself and the surgical staff.  
  Probable NDE during coronary bypass surgery.   

    4501.    Steve B Probable NDE     4/1/2018.      Probable NDE 8539.            The next thing I knew, I was in a sort of 'black box,' like a very dark void. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant. I was aware of "myself," Steve, but I didn't seem to have a physical body. I was wondering where I was with all this blackness surrounding me—but I was definitely aware of myself.    
  Probable NDE due to being shot in criminal attack.   

    4500.    Stefania S NDE     4/1/2018.      NDE 8530.       Exceptional Experience.  From Italy.  Original in Italian, translated to English by Amy.  Everything that happens is perfect because it accords perfectly with a cosmic order in which we all take part. In an instant, I knew that the life we live is an illusion. It's not real because it's a creation of our minds. We continually create thoughts and then project these thoughts outside of the mind, just as cinematic frames are projected onto a screen. In that moment, I knew that real life is something other than what we think it is. We all are expressions of a Love energy. It is from which we come and where we are destined to return so as to merge once again in this original Oneness which our minds make us believe we have lost. This place is Paradise and our Union with the All. 
  Remarkable NDE due to complications following open heart surgery at age 16.   

    4499.    Ildiko SL NDE-like     3/30/2018.      NDE-Like 8537.       From Germany.  Original in German, translated to English by Dan.     All I could think was that I'd made it, I'm free, and the pain has stopped. I felt safe and loved. I wanted to stay here and linger like this forever. I've never felt so good in my entire life. I was jubilant and thought, 'So this is what it's like to be free.'

    4497.    Victor R NDE     3/28/2018.      NDE 8534.            Then I felt like I was passing through an all-white and bright, endless area where I couldn't see my body or talk. It felt like I was a ball of energy just passing through something. Then a bright person, object or ball of energy appeared in front of me. It didn't say anything. But its presence made me comfortable and safe.  
  NDE due to complications from ruptured appendix at age seven.   

      4496.    Bridget B NDE     3/28/2018.      NDE 8533.            The next thing I know, I am in a 'space.' It was not quite like a room with walls or doors but it was an open space. It was so warm and comfortable. The best words to describe it was a feeling of utter contentment and peacefulness. It was bright and vibrant. God was there before me and I was delighted to see that God was holding my child. The baby was an infant and perfect in size and shape. God spoke to me and said something to the effect of, 'Everything is good. He is perfect and I forgive you. Do not feel guilty. You are forgiven and I love you.'   
  NDE due to car accident.   

    4495.    Maggie S NDE     3/28/2018.      NDE 8532.            I floated and watched for what seemed like hours. All of a sudden, a tunnel opened by the ceiling in the corner of the room. It was so bright, but I could still see. I knew I was supposed to go and I floated right into that tunnel. I remember it was like being in a warm bath and I floated in this tunnel for a while. It was so peaceful and calm and then I came to the other side. I saw the most brilliant city.  
  NDE due to complication of toxemia of pregnancy.   

    4494.    Theodor W NDE     3/27/2018.      NDE 8531.       From Germany.  Original in German, translated to English by Doreen.     After this realization, I stood with the angel in front of a large open gate, like a  heavenly gate.  Peter  and my guardian angel told me that I could not enter yet. This shocked me in a way, but at the same time, I felt such an infinite good-heartedness and love. I cannot put it into words. Everything was filled with this sense of unreserved security, love and being unconditionally accepted. 
  NDE due to sucide attempt.   

      4493.    Valeria Experience     3/27/2018.      Anesthesia Experience 8523.       From Italy.  Original in Italian.     I was in a very well-lit place together with other persons in a festive and joyful atmosphere. I had no recollection of a life on this earth.  I only felt a great feeling of wellness and freedom.  Then I heard an inner voice telling me that  I must go away. So  I was determined to leave. I tried to leave that party without being noticed.  
  This is a possible NDE or an anesthesia experience.   

      4492.    Carlos C NDE     3/19/2018.      NDE 8526.       From Argentina. Original in Spanish, translated from Spanish by Sean.      I knew the place where they were sending me. I stopped thinking about my parents and about the world. Nothing was important except that feeling of love and of knowing I was returning home to my true life. There was a six-foot wall at the edge of the lawn that divided our house from our neighbor's. On this wall, I saw a light starting to grow. It was like a brilliant golden egg that was expanding, creating a tunnel of light. And at the same time my sense of security and of knowledge were growing. Everything became clear to me in all respects.    
  Teenage NDE from electrocution.   
  
      4491.    Anonza Probable NDE     3/18/2018.      Probable NDE 8529.       From South Africa     I had an intense sense of flying through a bright white mist or fog. The deeper I flew into the fog, the more intense the sense of comfort and wellbeing I felt. I also distinctly felt more and more tired, like an intense need to sleep. I just wanted to get deeper into this mist. I also recall that I was flying into this mist at a gradient from above toward the 'ground'.
  Probable Hindu NDE due to apparent faint during prayer session at school.   

    4490.    Ryan M NDE     3/18/2018.      NDE 8528.            I looked down and saw a strange object far below me in the darkness. It was writhing in a way that 'looked wrong.' This was a sensation I had while viewing it, and not a distinct thought. I flew down toward the object only to see that it was my own body that was dying and seizing; it appeared as if I was doing rapid sit-ups with no regard for my safety or attempt to brace my head.   
  NDE due to choking at age 13.   

    4489.    Laurie L NDE     3/15/2018.      NDE 8525.       Exceptional Experience.     Yahshael and I were teleported to the center of a vast golden field. I could hear the most beautiful music and I could feel it moving through me. The breeze blew against the tall golden wheat stalks, and as it did I could feel the spirit of all things living around me: animals, plants, the elements. I was one with them. I looked up and saw a huge ball of light that cast the purest, warm light all around me and felt God touch my skin. He knew me, he loved me no matter how imperfect my Earthly life had been.  
  Remarkable NDE due to drowning at age 19.   

    4488.    Begitte C NDE     3/5/2018.      NDE 8506.       From Denmark.  Original in Danish, translated to English by Jan.     I was lying on the bed while he was stranguling me, and i tried to push him away. At last I could not fight anymore, because he was pushing so hard. I remember that I was angry, but when I became lax, I was completely calm. For a long time I was unable to move. It was as if I was not present in my own body. After that I floated above the two of us and looked down. It was a quiet and serene feeling, but I remember that I was then pulled back again. It was difficult returning. It was not pleasant, the other was a better feeling.  
  NDE due to strangling.   

    4487.    Rene K NDE     3/3/2018.      NDE 8521.       From Germany.  Original in German, translated to English by Marguy.     In the next moment, I was in a park with birds chirping and insects humming around. It was very beautiful. There were flowers everywhere and various types of grass and great, old trees. A mild breeze moved the leaves making them rustle. It was a pleasant day in late summer at an advanced afternoon time. The sun was shining, but it wasn't unpleasant. I looked at a small house that seemed to fit into this situation. A tall, elderly man was in front of the house and was wearing a dark coat/hooded cloak. He had a long beard, looked at me with loving eyes, and welcomed me with caring words.  
  NDE from cancer complications.   

    4486.    Donna NDE     3/3/2018.      NDE 8515.            One moment, I was on the steps. The next moment, I found myself in a dimly lit tunnel. I could see a light at the very end, but it was not bright. I remember thinking I needed to walk in that direction. As I began to walk I noticed there were other people walking in the same direction. It’s as if I knew they were people but I could not see faces. They appeared as only silhouettes. It was as if I were looking at their shadows but somehow I knew they were other people. It wasn’t overly crowded but there were quite a few of us there. I remember feeling the need to walk forward with the other people.     
  NDE due to suicide a few weeks ago.   
  
    4485.    Robin H NDE     2/27/2018.      NDE 8519.            As I was above the scene, I could hear the firefighters working on me. I was peacefully confident that I wasn't going to die, but I knew they thought I was. I could hear but I couldn't see because of the blinding light. I felt very calm and peaceful. I kept thinking, and sort of telling my rescuers, 'I'm still here, I'm still here' at that time I had 'coded out.'  
  NDE due to being shot.   

    4484.    Barbara L Probable NDE     2/27/2018.      Probable NDE 8518.            All of a sudden, I found myself in a eerily strange place. In front of me, I saw an eternity of nothingness. I immediately decided that Anything would be better than Nothing.

    4483.    Lynnda F Possible NDE     2/26/2018.      Possible NDE 8517.            Soon after this, I found myself in some sort of square-ish bubble. I could see the rainbow effect of it on the walls but everything around it and outside of it was black. When I looked down, I noticed that I was wearing a white gown and realized at that time that I was dead. I remember commenting to myself 'I'm dead, I really am dead,' but it didn't matter to me at all. It seemed that everything I looked at in this darkness, I could see quite plainly. I soon realized that the soft light of it seemed to be coming from me. 
  Possible NDE associated with blacking out when she had the flu.   

    4482.    JH Probable NDE     2/18/2018.      Probable NDE 8512.            When I got halfway there, I asked God, 'But what about Randall?' He was my husband at the time, and I know I wanted to come back and be of help to him because he had mental health issues.  I felt as if God said, 'OK!!' Then I felt myself being let go and I slowly drifted back down into my body again.  
  Probable NDE due to complications after caesarian section delivery.   

    4481.    Brooke S Possible NDE     2/18/2018.      Possible NDE 8511.            The morgue workers soon left and placed the clipboard where they had been writing details onto my torso. I could continuously hear them talking and working in another part of the morgue, but I was unable to cry out for help. I began to realize that this was what death was like and I was really upset.
  Possible NDE due to being struck by cars.  Recovered in morgue.   

    4480.    Linda A NDE     2/15/2018.      NDE 8509.            I was up against the ceiling in this huge workout room. I wasn't in my body. I describe it as a vapor of me. Words cannot describe the way I felt because it was beyond anything imaginable. I was so very happy, peaceful, and content! I felt feelings I did not know I could feel or that even existed. On one side of me, it was very bright.  
  NDE due to cardiac arrest that was monitored during exercise.   

    4479.    Judie S NDE     2/15/2018.      NDE 8508.            I remember how surreal it was to realize how dark our world is. I'm not sure how to describe this but I could see the world. I was as if a veil had been lifted that made everything very clear and vivid. I rose up out of the dark part of the world and ascended into a very right, peaceful, and painless reality.   
  NDE due to anesthetic complication during emergency caesarian section.   

    4478.    Johnny D NDE     2/12/2018.      NDE 8507.            I saw a tree that was about 400 to 500 feet high, but probably closer to 500 yards away. The tree had many colors to it's leaves, like gold, green, brown, and yellow. The tree sparkled like it had lots of diamonds on it. With a blink of my eye, I was next to this tree within a second. I was looking at each leaf and could see what was reflecting all the dazzling little colors of light. There were raindrops reflecting the the rainbow within each drop of each of the colored leaves the raindrops rested upon.
  NDE due to lightning strike at age 13.   

    4477.    Frandy Possible NDE     2/9/2018.      Possible NDE 8505.       From Indonesia.     Suddenly, I felt pulled up. I was moving up very fast. I was moving through many, billions and billions a little shiny dots around me. I think they were stars. In a second, I stopped moving. I don't know if it's a place or not, because I don't have any words to describe this. A place always has dimensions such as width and height. But it's not. This was an unlimited place without borders or time.  
  Possible NDE vs OBE at age 11-12.   

    4476.    Mark W NDE     2/8/2018.      NDE 8503.       From the UK.     I was shown, in this post-death state, how a still mind produces a calm line, and how a disorganised, un-concentrated mind produces a line like the a mountain-range. I remember thinking, 'Ah, this is how mountains are made.' I was also shown the earth from a great distance. The earth was wrapped by a great Being who radiated pink light around itself and the earth. It was a Being of pure love. I wondered if this Being who was wrapping the earth was Jesus.  
  NDE due to asthma attack.   

    4475.    Andrew Y NDE     2/4/2018.      NDE 8501.            The whole atmosphere around me was bathed in a purplish light. It was like I was floating in an illuminated purple cloud but I could see everything in the house as usual, but through the cloud. I had no more pain and thought that I had dreamed about falling down the stairs and hurting my back. But now, I had woken up from that horrible dream, and I was fine and had absolutely no pain anywhere. I was completely conscious and aware and felt fine.  
  NDE due to fall down stairs.

Suddenly I was in a field of tall, beautiful, green grass that was undulating in waves—yet there was no wind. Overhead, the sky was pink/rosy/purple and I felt a strong sense of well-being, as if I were in a wonderful paradise—a sort of Garden of Eden. I saw my husband walking towards me through the grass.
  Remarkable shared NDE with husband who died in crash.   

      4473.    Dr. Robert Cole     1/27/2018.      NDE 16095.       Exceptional Experience.     At first, it was the Light, a brilliant, white light, without reflection  and without glare.    Then, the feeling... of quiet jubilation, of peace and incredible serenity enveloping me. It was not ecstasy or any feeling I could identify, except perhaps glory in the warmest most positive sense of the word.  
  Psychiatrist's NDE in an email to his son Adam. Robert joined the light about 3 years ago.   
  
    4472.    Hervé P Probable NDE     1/25/2018.      Probable NDE 8496.        From France.  Original in French, translated to English by Marguy.    It started with my passing through a tunnel. The colors were dark, like grays and browns. At the end of the tunnel was something like the edge of a ravine. I saw this white light that I can't explain because I had never seen a color like that before. I felt extraordinarily well.  
  Probable NDE due to heart attack.   

      4471.    Jala W NDE     1/24/2018.      NDE 8494.            Then I blacked out and found myself traveling at a extremely high rate of speed down a long tunnel. The distance was great and there was a presence with me. The light knew my every thought. I had an emotional feeling that I could not control this. My privacy was gone but I could not know everything the light was thinking. I knew only what I was supposed to know.
  NDE at age 17 due to a fat embolism resulting from a prior injury.   

      4470.    Brian H NDE     5/27/2006 & 1/23/2018.      NDE 2663/8493.            The trees in the background looked VERY old, like the old trees that are over 1000 years old. There was a little girl standing in front of me with a grin on her face as she was looking at me. She had on blue clam-digger shorts and a white sleeveless, v-cut T-shirt. She was barefoot. As she stood smiling at me, I noticed that she had the greenest eyes I have ever seen, like fire-green. It was mid-day. The ocean, sun, birds, and the wind were so totally real that it was very confusing. Why was I there? 
  NDE due to criminal attack.   

    4469.    John B NDE    1/21/2018.      NDE 8492.            I was completely serene. The peace was so intense that it was all I could think about. I have been searching for peace and happiness all my life and have never found it until now. I enjoyed being in this state the whole time. I did not want to leave. I started to feel a power beyond imagination. This power was like it was the power of the entire universe. I did not possess the power but the power was felt all around me. It was like some sort of movement. The strength of this power was immense.
    NDE due to suicide attempt.   

    4468.    Miguel P NDE     1/21/2018.      NDE 8490.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to Spanish by Sean.     I started to breathe in water. This was the feeling I had in reality, that 'I breathed' but for sure, I was drowning. I wasn't in agony, but completely the opposite. The darkness had become clear. I saw crystaline clear water while I felt at peace. There was a very intense light, as if on a hot clear summer's day. I had the feeling of floating under a totally calm ocean.  
  NDE due to drowning.

In a split second, I came through a tunnel and to a place filled with bright light that did not hurt eyes. The soft bright light felt very comfortable and warm. I sensed this is a vast, boundless place. Even the area my feet stood on had that gentle white light. It felt not solid at all. There were no sounds or and nobody was there. I did not feel uncomfortable. On the contrary, I felt I was home.   
  NDE at age 5-6 due to passing out from illness.

    4465.    Martha A Probable NDE     1/12/2018.      Probable NDE 8486.       From Argentina. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Sean.     All of a sudden, I was in a fantastic city. The city was beautiful with buildings of glass. The main part of was skyscrapers that were real objects of art. Around me was a strong light which didn't tired my eyes. I was wearing a white tunic. A tall man was walking beside me. He was thin and was also wearing a white tunic. He was explaining everything to me about this beautiful city.
  Probable NDE from a professor and associated with surgery.   
  
    4464.    Lori W NDE     1/11/2018.      NDE 8485.            Next, I was hovering above the operating table. They were holding my baby boy above my abdomen.

  NDE at time of delivery.   

    4463.    Elaine K NDE     1/8/2018.      NDE 8483.            I remember a life review and seeing events in my short life as they went through my brain. I saw events in my life such as trips to my grandmother's house. I was in the dark and saw a light at the end of what seemed like a tunnel. I felt like I was being pulled to the light and I knew once I got there I would have crossed over.  
  NDE due to drowning at age 8.  Shared 50 years later.   

    4462.    Dr. Prasanna M Probable NDE     1/8/2018.      Probable NDE 8482.       Non-Western. From India.     In that blackness, I found myself falling downward and with increasing speed. Everything was black all around me.Though it appeared like a tunnel, I did not feel any limits or a wall. I was trying to hold onto what I thought might be a wall with my arms spread wide open. I continued to fall, more like slipping, to a deeper place at a very high speed. I do not remember how long I was falling.  
  Probable NDE from physician due to vagal reflex induced loss of consciousness.   

    4461.    Billy E NDE     1/7/2018.      NDE 8478.            I found myself looking down onto my body. I thought, 'Must be my diabetes, I must be going low.' I felt a purpose to life and understood that I cannot 'float' upwards anymore. I should head back down and go back into my body. 
  NDE due to diabetic issues at age 10.   

    4460.    Tammy H Possible NDE     1/1/2018.      Possible NDE 8477.            While staring at her features in my NDE, I saw so much of myself in her. She had long black hair and beautiful dark brown eyes. Her complexion was so beautiful and I saw my features. She had her father's eyes, and was probably close to 5 years old. Immediately and instinctively, I knew who she was before even asking. I was in awe of the similarity in features and asked 'are you'....? Before I could finish the sentence, she said, 'Yes Mommy', I'm your daughter.'   
  Possible NDE associated with surgery.  Remarkable detailed awareness of future soulmate during experience.   

    4459.    Anthony C NDE     1/1/2018.      NDE 8476.            What I do vividly recall, is finding myself floating over a scene unfolding on the ground below me. It was a very surreal experience in hindsight. But at the time my Being was without negative feelings like fright, anxiety, concern, etc. It was a completely peaceful feeling. It was very natural and I had no worries.   
  NDE due to head injury due to fall at age 5.   

      4458.    Jay H Probable NDE     1/1/2018.      Probable NDE 8475.            However, as I began to die, things got brighter when I dropped to about 15 feet deep. I was on the bottom of the pit and able to see everything around me. I started to get curious, as my mind did not feel like it was dying. I began to accept death and was not scared. At that moment, a voice, spoke to me and said this. 'Jay. It is not your time.'  
  Probable NDE due to drowning.
