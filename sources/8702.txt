  Comments:    Introductory comments to near-death experience (NDE)

      This page contains 125 near-death experiences (NDEs) that occurred at the time of a cardiac arrest and were shared in English

      Methodology: 

      Experiences were scored as NDEs if they met all of the following:

  1.  A lucid, organized experience occurring at the time of a life-threatening event so severe that there is unconsciousness or clinically apparent death with an absent heartbeat.

  2.  An NDE Scale score of 7 or higher.

  3.  Shared by the individual who personally had the NDE.

  4.  Shared via the completed survey form on nderf.org.

  These are NDEs from the most recent version of the NDERF survey (nderf.org). They are sequentially shared NDEs from November 11, 2011 to April 8, 2021. All accounts were scored as NDEs if they met the above criteria and regardless of experience content to avoid bias in studying the content of the NDEs.

  The NDEs posted on the NDERF website are edited only to correct obvious spelling and grammar errors. As remarkable as the NDEs are in this list, please remember that they accurately represent the real experiences of near-death experiencers (NDErs) from all walks of life and around the world.

  We strive to make a collection of NDEs from cardiac arrest available to the world with as comprehensive a collection of such NDEs as possible. We would be delighted to collaborate in this endeavor with anyone with other credible internet sources of NDEs from cardiac arrest.

  This list is public domain and may be used by anyone.

  Substantial efforts are made to minimize the risk of posting fraudulent NDE accounts on nderf.org: See a more detailed explanation. 

  We strive for accuracy in this list. If any NDEs in this list do not appear to be associated with cardiac arrest, or should not be in this list for any reason, please email us at nderf@nderf.org with the NDE registry number and URL. Thanks!
