Where  Professionalism Intersects NDEs by Jody

     This is an oversimplified legal discussion for purposes of general knowledge.&nbsp;   In reality, each of the grounds for liability would depend on specific  facts when applied to specific areas of federal and each person's particular state  law.&nbsp;  Each reader is advised to seek  additional legal counsel to limit liability as needed.&nbsp; This is not  intended as advice for those outside of Washington state, although there may be  implications that other's might wish to explore in their own states.

The purpose of posting  this article is not only for general information, but mainly for those seeking  professional counseling and psychological help resulting from experiencing an  NDE, the death of a loved one, or trying to integrate a spiritually  transformative event.&nbsp; There are many who hold themselves out as healers,  but may not be licensed or competent to practice in the healing arts.&nbsp;  Although there are many good and competent medical professionals among our  ranks, there are always a few that spoil it for everyone.&nbsp; The bottom line  is to make sure you thoroughly check out any medical or counseling professional  you decide to obtain services through.&nbsp; With that as the backdrop, below is  a discussion of legal liability concerning where professionalism and IANDS  intersect.
  
  One of the core issues with IANDS policy-making centers around legal liability.&nbsp;   These policies affect interaction between members, professionals, Friends  of IANDS groups, and Mother IANDS.&nbsp;  Many  times, the seeming unresponsiveness of the organization results in a lot of  criticism and animosity.&nbsp;  This is  most unfortunate, as the laws are what limit IANDS&#65533; ability to act, and falls  outside the power of the IANDS governing body.&nbsp;   Further, the mission statement, bylaws, and articles of incorporation,  will define what authority and powers IANDS has to organize business and  structure the meetings.&nbsp;  Therefore,  the following discussion will hopefully shine some light as to those boundaries  and Member concerns.&nbsp;  Then, should  someone wish to go outside of these particular limitations, then they are free  to do so.&nbsp;  The understanding being  that IANDS is not associated with the ultra vires actions.&nbsp;

  Among the concerns, Members want to form counseling support groups of NDE-only  members under the umbrella of IANDS.&nbsp;  Members  also want to know where they can find professionals such as doctors,  psychologists, counselors, or spiritual advisors, to deal with post-NDE  re-integration into mainstream society.&nbsp;  Board  Members are faced with the dilemma of providing member services and being liable  as a deep pocket for a law suit if an IANDS member or their family wants to sue:  1) the professional who caused harm to the Member, and/or; 2) IANDS for being  associated with the professional.&nbsp;  A  person who is both, a professional and an IANDS member, may be faced with  clearly delineating their role in the group as either a professional or a simply  a Member.&nbsp;  As a member, individuals  need to take responsibility for whom they choose to help them heal.&nbsp;   So, from many different angles within our ranks, we all need to develop  clear understandings that will satisfy member needs and also protect the NDE  organization.

The most common legal  theories in this analysis are torts and licensing problems.&nbsp;   A tort can be either an intentional or unintentional action that causes  harm to another person.&nbsp;  Misconduct  is usually a violation of a particular policy of a licensing agency or a  legislatively defined standard for a professional.&nbsp;   Many members may wonder where the line exists for practicing counseling  vs. lending a sympathetic ear for those who need help.&nbsp;   Finally, there is a type of tort called vicarious liability that holds an  organization liable for the actions of third-parties; essentially it is guilt by  association to enable the harmed party to get more money from a legal suit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In general, a tort  has four or five elements of proof.&nbsp;  There  must be 1) a duty owing between the parties, 2) a breach of that duty, 3) there  has to be a direct link of causation that the breach caused harm, and 4) there  needs to be proof of harm.&nbsp;  The fifth  element, may or may not include the element of intent.&nbsp;   Physical, emotional, or mental harm to a member could most commonly occur  through associations with other IANDS members either in the capacity of another  member or as a member who is also a professional.&nbsp;

Vicarious liability  could attach to a Friend of IANDS group or to Mother IANDS, regardless of  separate legal incorporation between the two, if there is a special relationship  between the professional member and IANDS.&nbsp;  This  means that if a professional acting under the authority of IANDS commits harm to  an IANDS member, then, ultimately both, the professional and IANDS, could be  held responsible for the harm.&nbsp;  Moreover,  it could be argued that IANDS may actually have a greater duty of care than  other organizations to protect its members, since there is a high-percentage of  vulnerable people.&nbsp;

This can be of great  concern since IANDS and most FOI groups do not have a lot of financial  resources.&nbsp;  The more common scenario  could possibly occur if an agency relationship could be established.&nbsp;   This would be a relationship whereby a person was authorized to represent  IANDS in dealings with Members.&nbsp; &nbsp; The  key issue would be whether or not an agency was created, either in writing, by  actions, or if non-authorized actions were subsequently ratified by the IANDS  Board.&nbsp;  This is the primary reason  why IANDS does not recommend or even maintain a list of professionals for  Members.&nbsp;  IANDS does not want to be  liable for any harm coming to a Member, nor do they want any type of  misunderstanding to arise that might look like an endorsement of professional  services or warranty of professional fitness.&nbsp;

Generally, the state  determines what professions need to be supervised for the good of the public.&nbsp;   Statutory requirements are stringent for health-related professions, as  the capacity to injure others is relatively high compared to other professions.&nbsp;   A person acting in a professional capacity is held to the standards of  the profession.&nbsp;  Misconduct could  arise if a professional Member fails to live up to the standards of the  profession and harms the Member.&nbsp;  However,  if a professional makes it clear that they are not acting in a capacity of a  professional Member, then they are held to the standard of any other member in  the group.&nbsp;

There are two other  potential pitfalls concerning professional Members.&nbsp;   One is in the area of writing, and the other is in the area of IANDS  leadership.&nbsp;  Any professional Member  who writes specific advice that is relied upon by readers to the detriment of  that reader, could potentially open themselves and IANDS up for a lawsuit.&nbsp;   The mere fact of publishing without disclaimers, could be considered as  an endorsement of the author&#65533;s views.&nbsp;

The other area of  concern is those professional Members who are also in IANDS leadership roles.&nbsp;   Generally, if a professional is a member of the Board of Directors or an  officer of the organization, they are shielded from liability so long as they  are operating under the general powers and authorities granted by the state,  bylaws, and articles of incorporation.&nbsp;  They  would normally only be personally liable if they operated outside of their grant  of power or scope of authority.&nbsp;  The  issue becomes whether or not a health-care professional in a leadership position  with IANDS can help Members without being personally liable.&nbsp;

A Member who is  acting as a professional may need to beware of potential liability for  practicing without a license.[1] &nbsp;   Generally, the line of demarcation is whether or not advice is offered.&nbsp;   The issue hinges on what constitutes &#65533;practicing&#65533; a licensed  profession.&nbsp;  The best legal  protection for a Member is not to represent oneself as either a professional or  a healer who falls under state licensing regulations.

However, there may be  some statutory criteria and exemptions that could help mitigate against  potential legal suits.&nbsp;  It appears,  at least in Washington, that there could be an escape clause for professionals  if: 1) the counseling is&nbsp;  &#65533;incidental&#65533;  to the authorized scope of practice or such that the professional is not  specifically charged with counseling duties for IANDS, or; 2) counseling when  approved by a non-profit organization, or; 3) counseling when associated with  religion.[2] &nbsp;  &nbsp;

The formation of  small support groups among Members, would legally depend on the purpose and  scope of what the support group(s) is(are) intended to accomplish.&nbsp;   IANDS would need to establish policies and procedures for subgroups  solicited during IANDS meetings or formed under the umbrella of being associated  with IANDS.&nbsp;  If counseling or therapy  is involved, then IANDS would need to check state laws, get the appropriate  insurance and/or licenses, and modify bylaws and policies accordingly.

Based upon the  foregoing discussion several recommendations follow below.
  
  1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    IANDS Organizations need to limit potential vicarious liability to  the greatest extent possible.&nbsp;  This  may be done by a combination of disclaimers, waivers, policies that clearly  state the relationship obligations and expectations between 1) Members and IANDS  and 2) Professional Members and Members, and bylaws consistent with such  disclaimers and policies.&nbsp;  Review and  make sure that policies and meetings are consistent and within the scope of  power granted with the mission statement and statutory laws.&nbsp;
  
   2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    It is recommended that all FOI groups maintain bylaws, mission  statements, and policies consistent with Mother IANDS.&nbsp;   This would minimize liability and negative publicity for Mother IANDS.

3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    A procedure for professional Member endorsements, if any, should  be established or written in IANDS policies or specifically prohibited as  appropriate.

  &nbsp;4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Professionals should be clear about their role in IANDS and the  policy established by IANDS should clearly be communicated to Members.&nbsp;   It would be recommended that professionals understand that they can use  their professional skills in communicating with Members, but holding themselves  out to the Members in a Professional capacity should be discouraged unless  approved by the IANDS Board and consistent with established policies and  procedures.

  &nbsp;5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Policies regarding Members should promote recognition that they  accept responsibility for choosing their own method of healing and perform their  own independent investigating of any professional Member they may come in  contact with through their association with IANDS.

  &nbsp;6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Lastly, it has been suggested that a subgroup be formed of  NDE-only Members to meet in small numbers.&nbsp;  While  it might be possible to have small subset groups, it is not consistent with the  Mother IANDS mission statement to exclude people.[3] &nbsp;   Therefore, it would be legally prudent to either meet with other NDErs on  an informal basis such as dinner after the meeting or form a group that is not  associated with IANDS.&nbsp;  As this  action may have other implications outside the legal analysis, it is recommended  that further study be directed towards analyzing the history of IANDS groups,  the duration, success or failure of similarly created subgroups.          [1]       RCW 18.130.020(6),  &quot;Unlicensed      practice&quot; means: (a) Practicing a profession or operating a business      identified in RCW 18.130.040      without holding a valid, unexpired, unrevoked, and unsuspended license to do      so; or (b)Representing to a consumer, through offerings, advertisements, or      use of a professional title or designation, that the individual is qualified      to practice a profession or operate a business identified in RCW 18.130.040,      without holding a valid, unexpired, unrevoked, and unsuspended license to do      so.

      &nbsp;              [2]       RCW      18.19.040 ,      Exemptions.  Nothing      in this chapter may be construed to prohibit or restrict:&nbsp;       (1) The practice of a profession by a person who is either      registered, certified, licensed, or similarly regulated under the laws of      this state and who is performing services within the person's authorized      scope of practice, including any attorney admitted to practice law in this      state when providing counseling incidental to and in the course of providing      legal counsel;&nbsp;  (2) The practice      of counseling by an employee or trainee of any federal agency, or the      practice of counseling by a student of a college or university, if the      employee, trainee, or student is practicing solely under the supervision of      and accountable to the agency, college, or university, through which he or      she performs such functions as part of his or her position for no additional      fee other than ordinary compensation; (3) The practice of counseling by a      person without a mandatory charge; (4) The practice of counseling by persons      offering services for public and private nonprofit organizations or      charities not primarily engaged in counseling for a fee when approved by the      organizations or agencies for whom they render their services; (5)      Evaluation, consultation, planning, policy-making, research, or related      services conducted by social scientists for private corporations or public      agencies; (6) The practice of counseling by a person under the auspices of a      religious denomination, church, or organization, or the practice of religion      itself;

      &nbsp;               [3]       IANDS'      mission is to respond to people's needs for information and support      concerning Near-death and similar experiences, and to encourage recognition      of the experiences as genuine and significant events of rich meaning.        Our goals are:To enrich our      understanding of the nature and scope of human consciousness and its      relationship to life and death; To encourage thoughtful exploration of all      facets of near-death and related experiences; To respond to people's needs      to integrate the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of the      NDE into their daily living. To provide reliable information about      near-death experiences to experiencers, researchers, and the public; To      serve as a contact point and community for people with particular interest      in near-death and related experiences.
