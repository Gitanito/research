  		              		Experience Description   

    I was with friends preparing a barbecue on the terrace. It was very hot and for a moment I looked at a girlfriend while saying to her, 'I'm dying'. And then I collapsed. 

  My body was falling and then I found myself immediately in a state of completeness. There was no pain nor physical sensations of weight or any pressure. I was at the same place but everything was white and bathed in a soft light. I heard some music and people were talking. I felt extremely well and beyond the physical limitations of my body. All at once, I became aware that the music was different than  one moment ago when I had been falling. Then I told myself that I might be dead or at the point of going, and I wanted to come back to my body. In my ears I heard a noise similar to the noise when you dive under water. I was reintegrating into my physical body by becoming aware of all sensations provided by my environment. 

  My girlfriend had been throwing water in my face when she saw that I was unconscious. She told me that  my fall had been cushioned. When I asked how long I was unconscious, it was only a small time that I was gone but it seemed to me much longer during my journey. 

  I realized that you don't need to be scared of dying as it wasn't unpleasant to go and that we continue to exist outside of our physical body.  Since my experience, I have experimented  exploring other planes of space/time thanks to meditation and am perfectly convinced by what humans might call reincarnation. My many years as a nurse in palliative care have also reinforced this idea  because I can feel whether the soul is  present  or not when a  patient is passing over.  I also hear them  telling of their visions of loved ones before dying.
