  		      4073.    Josep C Probable NDE     12/28/2015.      Probable NDE 7866.       From Spain.     I was hovering over fields of green grass, then I was floating over smooth green hills.  They were beautiful and lush fields underneath a blue sky. I think there were some farm animals, but I do not clearly remember that. I do clearly remember the feelings of happiness, stillness, and fullness. Suddenly, I found myself passing through a tunnel of light and at the end of the tunnel, I saw the faces of the three medical assistants while I was reconnecting my body. 
  Probable NDE due to apparent loss of consciousness during blood donation.   

    4072.    Cindy S NDE      12/26/2015.      NDE 7865.           The light was so white, it was blue. I arrived in a room where an unknown entity held me while I was shown a life review.  This included the newspaper report of my death with even a clerical error of the location. I was then told that it was not my time yet because I had many life lessons to experience.  I did not want to go back.  
   NDE due to drowning at age 10.   

    4071.    Greg McC NDE      12/26/2015.      NDE 7864.        From New Zealand.     I felt myself floating into pitch blackness accompanied by an incredible feeling of peace and tranquility. It was the most serene and beautiful experience imaginable. I couldn't see anything in this darkness, yet I could feel an overwhelming peace and serenity. It was an amazingly beautiful experience. I don't know how long this lasted, but I didn't want it to stop. The next thing I recall was a very annoying jab in my right arm.  
   NDE due to anaphylactic allergic reaction.   

    4070.    Sherry B NDE      12/26/2015 & 8/1/2017.      NDE 7863/8349.           A calm came over me. I then heard a female voice say, 'you will not die'. Husband managed to get his foot on the break at that point.   I screamed, 'mom, is that you ?'  I then realized that it was a voice from the spiritual realm.  A sense of calmness enveloped me, despite major head trauma.  
      NDE due to car accident with head trauma.       

    4069.    John R Probable NDE      12/19/2015.      NDE 7859.           I was very happy and in a relaxed state of mind, somewhat euphoric. It was like I was floating through dark matter, like a fog but not quite like that. I started experiencing a higher sense of awareness, like waking up from a dream but more like coming out of a stupor or blank stare. I was lying on a table made of stone that was light gray in color. But I'm not feeling my body. I only notice my body as I look around; by looking around I mean that it was definitely much wider and broad type of vision than normal. Before I looked around and saw the tables, I was so calm and at peace. I was relaxed, like all my worries, problems and everything was amazingly great. I was like nirvana or an enlightened state of mind. That quickly changed.  
   This is a probable NDE because it looks like it may have started as a NDE but could have changed to only a drug experience from heroin overdose.   

    4068.    Vanna S NDE      12/15/2015.      NDE 23075.           I was above myself looking down as I was placed in the ambulance. I was flanked by two unknown presences who were supportive but didn't speak.  That is all I remember. I believe it was a sign for me to move forward toward healing and noble suffering and to find more healing.  
   Briefly described NDE due to suicide attempt.   

    4067.    Oscar C NDE      12/15/2015.      NDE 7858.           I could see the bridge clearly.  At the end of the bridge was an old wooden door and a tall male figure standing by it.  He was dressed in what looked like a monk-type robe and hood. I could see that he had long brown hair that was just past his shoulders but I could not see his face.  There was a very bright, pure, and beautiful light that I could see coming from underneath and from the sides that illuminated the door.  I felt scared and confused on the bridge but I felt that I knew the figure and was anxious to get to him. I got to the end of the bridge and we talked.  
   NDE due to auto accident at age 15.   

    4066.    Paul M NDE      12/15/2015.      NDE 7857.           Then once I accept I would die, it started to feel great.  At this point, the white light appeared.  I felt I was moving towards it and was feeling better the closer I got to the light. It was very strange, I saw no one but felt as if I were surrounded by untold numbers of benevolent entities.  I could feel their presence and all pleasant. The further I entered into the light, the more pleasant it got.  The light had an emotional overtone to it. I have NEVER felt anything that felt as real as this in my life; never have I felt so at peace.  
   NDE due to drowning.   

    4065.    Philip S NDE      12/13/2015.      NDE 7855.           But then I was caught off guard, because this perfected royal figure was not there to see them. It came to within an inch of my face and smiled at me with the same concern a parent would have for their child after they been involved in an accident.  I still couldn't see, hear, smell or taste, but my feelings returned.   This royal figure just smiled and gently said something to the effect of, 'My child, why are you here?  It is not your time to be here, I have to send you back!'  This incredible figure sensed my concerns and added, 'Don't be afraid when you return back to Earth and make mistakes, just live your life the best way you can and try to show the unconditional love for the people you meet, the same way my subjects shown their unconditional love for you!  Don't be afraid if people believe in me or not, just have faith that anyone you meet will be touched in some way or another from your experience and let me handle the difficult job of judging people if needed.'  I felt this Royal figure gently pick me up and take me back to my body that seemed billions of light years away.  The journey back was so much more peaceful as we headed back to earth.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest.  Extraordinary understandings on time and location from NDE.   

    4064.    Judith D Probable NDE      12/11/2015.      Probable NDE 7854.           It isn't really possible now, after all these years, for me to say what order things happened in exactly.  I was hearing a loud voice or voices.  I could see some specific colors that were were jewel-tones of red and green.  I saw the hem of a gown, that had thick and very beautiful gold embroidery around the hem.  It looked to me, like the hem of a gown worn by an angel, or angels.  That was the only idea I had at the time as I was returning to life, or consciousness.  I could hear the sounds merge into the sounds of my parents coming into the kitchen and my father's voice calling me.  
   Probable NDE due to faint at age 16.   

    4063.    Dave M NDE      12/11/2015 &amp; 11/4/2016.      NDE 7853/8135.           I woke up and everything was very dark. I wasn't in any pain but felt very heavy.  My body looked different and shapeless. I felt as though I had slowly came out of my body.  I had this extreme feeling of heaviness; I wasn't scared, it was more of a pleasant feeling. Than a hand reached out to take mine so I reached out for it.  Then I fell into a pleasant dream-state that felt as though I had been sleeping for like a half hour.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest.  Experience shared about two weeks after it occurred.   

    4062.    Alessio F FDE      12/9/2015.      FDE 7845.        From Italy. Original in Italian, translated to English.     After a few seconds, I found myself out of this dimension. I was no longer there.  What I could 'see' was a canvas. But 'see' is a wrong term because it wasn't with my eyes.  It was as if I were watching a television or watching in a movie hall.  I saw a few meaningful scenes from my brief life were being showed. I remembered a birthday party. I cannot tell how long the life review lasted.  Over there time did not exist, just like this world did not exist, and I was neither scared nor glad. I was watching my life movie without emotions, as if it were totally normal. I could hear no voices or else.  
   Fear-death experience as a child.   

    4061.    Muriel N NDE      12/9/2015 &amp; 3/8/2015.      NDE 7852/7606.        From France. Original in French, translated to English by Camille.     I was again transferred directly to the operating room where I decided to let go of a body that was painful to me. I felt myself pop out through the top of my head. I hovered over this body that I no longer wanted as I saw the medical team busy itself in silence. The light reappeared, I followed her but saw nothing. I heard again a question, 'What do you want ?' I chose to come back to my body  
   One experience is a definite NDE and the other is a Probable NDE associated hemorrhaging.   

    4060.    Brian M Probable NDE      12/8/2015.      Probable NDE 7849.           I had a very keen sense of what was going on around me, my journey into heaven, and meeting up with my deceased father.  My father told me I had to go back. We both turned away from each other.  
   Probable NDE associated with head and facial trauma.   

    4059.    Debra S NDE      12/8/2015.      NDE 7850.           The first thing I remember is being in a tunnel and looking out of a round window or opening.  I could see my husband holding me and telling me not to go, to stay, and to come back.  I didn't feel any pain.  I never turned around as I kept looking through this window.  I could see myself lying there.  I remember thinking that I needed to go back because I couldn't leave my husband.  I also remember thinking that I had to make sure that I could move my fingers and toes first to make sure I wasn't paralyzed.  When I could move them, I was instantly drawn back into my body.  
   NDE due to head injury.  Shared about six weeks after NDE occurred.   

    4058.    Courtni T NDE      12/3/2015.      NDE 7848.        From France. Original in French, translated to English by Marguy.     I quickly see a few things from my life. I feel the arrival of somebody behind me on the left.  It is my deceased father. I communicate with him without words or any language except love.  He is guiding me by making me understand that I have a choice.  I can chose to live and to experience love on earth. I see the realization of the scenario of my death, the sadness of my loved ones, my friends returning to Paris without me, and the sorrow of my little sister.  It's unbearable to me.  
   NDE from drowning during canoe ride.   

    4057.    Benjamin F NDEs      12/3/2015.      NDEs 7847.        From France. Original in French, translated to English by Marguy.     While drowning at the age of 3 in Africa, the feelings of panic and pain of the lungs filling with water, was followed by a sensation of a pleasant void and being 'carried'. Immediately after this drowning, I felt the painful sensation of having to live, yet feeling lucky and 'chosen.'  
   Two NDEs from an atheist.   

    4056.    Winona A NDE      11/22/2015.      NDE 7841.           Next to me on my right side was a presence.  They were similar to the 'light beings' I had seen when I was three years old. But this time, the presence turned into a likeness of Jesus.  He stood next to me and looked in my eyes.  Then he touched/rubbed my right cheek.  I immediately was able to breath and was free of pain and fear. I was still with the perpetrator, on a table, but knew that nothing he could do could destroy this one-ness.  This connection with something so much larger than his abuse, hate, and lies.  The Jesus presence then asked me to 'see.' I saw myself in a shamanic journey that I had done what I was around 40 years old. I was standing in the midst of complete and total light.  The white light doesn't really come from anywhere and is bright but not at all bright.  It was all encompassing, fully surrounded me, and was completely loving. This light and love stayed with me briefly after the Jesus presence left.  
   NDE at time of criminal attack at age 17.   

    4055.    Sharon NDE      11/18/2015.      NDE 7839.           I then noticed a very soft, yet worn-looking, flow and fold of a light blue and gold robe. I could only see the legs of the person wearing the robe. I knew He was God. I wanted to see His face as I moved closer, but I did not. During my travel toward the light, I recall hearing gently softly-spoken words. I somehow knew that I needed to remember the words. I recall feeling slight frustration that I was having difficulty remembering the words, but after a while, I had 'memorized' them and recall feeling relieved. The words I was being 'told' were:  'Seek not to understand so that you may believe, but seek to believe so that you may understand.'  I then felt myself being pulled back and away from the light. I did not want to go and recall feeling sad. I tried to fight being pulling back. Yet, I continued moving backward.  
   NDE due to pneumonia.  Shared by a nurse.  Experience shared less than a month after it occurred.   

    4054.    Lisa S Probable NDE      11/17/2015.      Probable NDE 7837.           Then a genderless voice asked me, 'Are you ready to go?'  I said, 'Yes.' Then I went through a black tunnel.  I was so calm and peaceful.   It was dark but I felt very secure.  It was as  if I were with the Holy Ghost? My whole life flashed before my eyes like watching an old movie with reels except, it was crystal clear in color almost like triple HD.  The voice said, 'It isn't your time yet.'  My energy/soul/self was hurled back into my body.  
   Probable NDE due to near drowning in bathtub.   

    4053.    Stéphanie B NDE      11/15/2015.      NDE 7836.        From France.  Original in French, translated to English by Marguy.     Everything around is turning hazy, like cotton...what's happening? Come, come now...I have no fear. I feel less and less bad, pain is flying away at the same time as I do, going above this body that is hurting so much, that I don't want anymore. It is hurting me. I'm sinking into this well-being, the room is lighting up, changes light...it's so very white but not blinding. I feel good, in peace, I don't hurt anymore...I'm thinking about my boys (without seeing their picture before my eyes)...good bye babies. No, my angels. Good bye my angels. I feel no sorrow at all to leave them, no fear to go where I don't know... I want to go there. I feel so good, so in peace  
   NDE from reaction to anesthesia.   

    4052.    Marie S Possible NDE      11/14/2015.      Possible NDE 7835.        From France.  Original in French, translated to English by Cassandra.     In the distance I saw a light, and I went back into the Light. I don’t remember having gone through a tunnel. The light was a very intensely bright, but not blinding, light. I could hear sublime music that sounded like love songs. I knew at that moment that I am not alone in the world. I felt an unconditional and infinite love. I had never felt so bathed in love and I had never felt anything like that since. I was immersed in this ocean of love and an inexpressible joy rose in my heart. There are not big enough words to explain my happiness. I felt completely understood, fulfilled, and loved just as I am. I was so far from the cares and worries of this earth!  
   Possible NDE vs. anesthesia experience.   

    4051.    Cristina NDE      11/14/2015.      NDE 7826.        From Italy.  Original in Italian.     The next thing I knew, I was in the midst of bright green hills below a blue sky.  The colors were so vivid and bright that I have never seen anything like that in my life.  I wasn't a person, but a spirit.  I could not see my arms, legs, or other body parts.  I felt other presences as light beside me.  It was the most beautiful feeling I ever had.  I wasn't afraid.  I wasn't wondering where I was.  I wasn't thinking that I am a Christian and just had surgery.  I thought none of this.  I only knew I was at peace, a feeling of eternal peace.  I felt as if I had reached a peace that was more than I ever thought possible.  It wasn't the end, but the beginning.  
   NDE from surgery complications.   

    4050.    John B NDE      11/14/2015.      NDE 7834.        Caution graphic violence.     Then, I do not know how to describe this. It is as if I were a glove, or a piece of clothing, that was being turned inside-out, or folding in on itself. It is uncomfortable. I fight it, but can only let go into it. I find myself in something that resembles a 'tunnel of clouds.' (I say 'myself,' but my sense of self is not very distinct from what is around me at this point). I am floating, moving toward the end of the tunnel. All around, there are flashes of light, like lightning in the clouds as I move through them. In front of me, I can now see and feel the presence of a 'being,' as I am moving toward it. I will call it the 'Light Being.' As I move toward the Being, it has the most amazing warmth and magnetism. I have a feeling of 'Yes, this is where I belong'. I am being drawn into this Light Being, as if I am to become a part of it. I feel completely relieved, I am finally at home, and I give in to it.  
   NDE due to criminal attack.   

    4049.    Paul F Probable NDE      11/10/2015.      Probable NDE 7833.           The next thing I knew was that I was suspended in a vast black darkness.  I was terrified, heading towards a black mist. It was not a wet mist, but more like a black fog. At this point, I am watching these events from both inside my body as well as outside my body.  As I enter this fog, feet first on my back, the feeling begins to leave my body starting at my feet.  The feeling creeps towards my head. I am terrified as I am surrounded by vast darkness and black fog. I am screaming and crying, 'No! No! I do not want to go! Please God, I don't want to go there!' I have never been so terrified.  
   Probable NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    4048.    Thomas A NDE      11/10/2015.      NDE 7832.           Next, I saw myself through the ceiling.  I began to spin toward a cityscape and popped out onto a large organic looking portico.  I saw a large crystalline, night time city view. I knew each of those light was one of my lifetimes. I immediately knew the secret of life and I recall saying to my self, 'Oh, that is so simple; I must remember this when I return.'  Two humanoid beings in white showed up and found it humorous that I was there.  
   NDE due to dental anesthetic complication.   

    4047.    Latimer B Possible NDE      11/8/2015.      Possible NDE 7831.        From Australia     I noticed that my body was lying on the floor and I was standing on top of me. Then I entered a dark place where this green baboon approached me from the darkness. I knew instantly that this Being was Thoth. I had learned a little about Thoth in a philosophy class at university. Thoth was holding a set of gold scales. I don't recall if there was anything on the scales. My attention was then drawn to another Being in the room. He looked like one of those bird-headed Egyptian, humanoid figures. I later identified this Being as Osiris from looking at pictures in books.  
   Possible NDE associated with apparent heroin overdose.  Very atypical content for usual NDEs.   

    4046.    Kenneth F NDE      11/7/2015.      NDE 23065.        From the United Kingdom.     Ostensibly dead, I was now an artifact and not a person. Clean, I was wheeled into another room down the corridor. Here, I was put on a sort of giant set of weighing scales, used for cadavers. My torso was put onto a kind of bucket, with my head and limbs dangling over the side. From there, I was take to another smaller, dimly lit room where my body was placed onto a glass-topped table. After a little while, two people, students in white coats, came in and took serial photos of me, supine and prone and arranged in various positions. I was then put in the main morgue, stretched out on a large marble shelf. I was squeezed in with other dead bodies, some covered in sheets and others naked. There didn't seem to be much space, as I was laid over a couple of old men, both with grey-beards and obese; one completely bald and the other with a torso covered in tattoos - ugh!  
   NDE due to clinical death during cardioversion to treat atrial fibrillation.  Remarkable account of trip to the morgue and subsequent return to life.   

    4045.    Rafael A FDE      10/31/2015.      FDE 7825.        Originally from Peru.  Original in Spanish, translated to English by Sean.     I remember that everything snowed out in a white color, I wasn't there for a second, and for eternity. I remembered my lover, (now my wife), my family, my life, and I also thought about all my future plans, I saw them in a graphic way, as if come to life. I had never experienced this kind of revelation, about what I wanted to do or how I feel about my loved ones in reality.  
   Fear-death experience at gunpoint.   

    4044.    Brenda L Probable NDE      10/28/2015.      Probable NDE 7824.           During that time what I saw and felt was amazing. I felt carefree, like I had no worries and nothing could harm me. I was surrounded by a bright, white light. Brighter than anything I have ever seen. All around me was white light, but it was concentrated and brighter right in front of me.  
   Probable NDE due to complication of epidural anesthesia during caesarian section delivery.   

    4043.    Francisco AC Possible NDE      10/28/2015.      Possible NDE 7823.        From Spain.  Original in Spanish, translated to English by Sean.     When I got up, I turned around following an intense light of intense color. I was flooded with a mountain of pleasant memories; memories of the ones I love in my life passed before me. The light pushed me into a tunnel that also was of brilliant colored light, inviting me to go through. With some effort, I understood that behind the light was God. I understood that I had wasted so much of my life. With great effort, I decided to not go into the tunnel.  
   This is a possible NDE because it is hard to tell if it is a NDE or an ICU experience.   

    4042.    Darcy L NDE      10/25/2015.      NDE 7815.        From France.  Original in French, translated to English by Marguy.     I found myself in blackness, in a kind of tunnel without limits. And I advanced toward the tunnel while floating, I felt good, even very good. I was completely alone and all at once in the distance I saw a small white glow. As I advanced, the light became bigger. It was an opaque light, like cotton. Then I felt an immense happiness, a big joy and peace. While I intensely experienced this wonderful plenitude and as I was still pulled forward towards this light, a 'voice,' thought, or a spirit maybe my own, I don't know, said to me, ' It's not the moment.'  
   Child NDE from peritonitis from appendicitis.   

    4041.    Sophia J NDE      10/25/2015.      NDE 7818.        From France.  Original in French, translated to English by Marguy.     I am quite shocked to see myself lying on my stomach.  Then I was in front of my grandfather, who passed the year before. I feel good and I want to stay.  But my grandfather tells me that I have to return and that everything will be okay. We were bathed in a kind of green halo. My grandfather is sitting on his tomb. I don't feel my body anymore. I refuse to go.  It seems that time stopped.  
   NDE from falling off a horse.   

    4040.    David N Possible NDE     12/30/2011.      NDE 6135.        Exceptional Experience From Australia.     As the angel took me up out of my room and up towards the upper atmosphere it was talking to me the hole time and telling me things about the reasons as to why we live and learn on Earth to help us to evolve our spirit. The Angel told me that it was 'all a learning experience.'  WE moved on from there into heaven where I was taken to a Beautiful building that had a clear ceiling that you could see out to the heavens. I was introduced to family ancestors and people that I had met that had passed over. I was filled with love and joy that I can not describe when I was in there presence, It was like we could feel each others love and joy as though it was one energy. The angel gave me time with the past family and friends and then we moved into another part of the building to a room where I met two Very wise male figures who spoke to me about my life. I absolutely loved being in their Presence.  
   Exceptional Possible NDE that is at the least a NDE-like STE.  Remarkable spiritual wisdom.  He submitted this in 2011 but was just diagnosed with sleep apnea, so it is possible that this could be a NDE.   

    4039.    Lisa S NDE      10/24/2015.      NDE 7817.           I don't know what happened in between but the next thing I see is my lifeless body on the surgical table surrounded by three surgeons. I saw my family in the surgery window crying. I'm not in my body but instead, I'm floating above everyone and I see this and can describe it without a doubt. The next thing that happens is a bright, white light appearing on the side of me. I see hands and they come out but I do not see a face. I see a beard but the face isn't there. I hear a man's voice come out of this, an angel. He tells me, 'Lisa, it's not your time to go.  Look at your family, they need you. You have greater purpose in this lifetime and you will succeed in that purpose. You need to go back.' I don't remember if I spoke to the angel but I, indeed, went back to my body and my family and my life.  
   NDE due to head injury at around age 5.   

    4038.    Tim B NDE      10/24/2015.      NDE 7816.           Then I was looking down on the truck.  I could tell I was floating above shoplight in the garage. I could see the hood and roof of the truck. Then I was some place else.  It was all brown.  I heard a voice say, 'Your kids can't lose their dog and their dad in the same week.' My dog had been hit by a car on the highway four days earlier.  The next thing I knew, I was looking up at the underside of the truck.  
   NDE due to truck rolling over him.   

    4037.    Melisa A NDE      10/20/2015.      NDE 7812.           And although there were two choices on the table, I remember thinking that which ever choice I was allowed to choose, everything would still be okay. I remember her tellling me that if I go back I will have a child. But that I will have a special duty as well. I made a choice to go back to the life I had rather than staying with her. She told me that I needed a lot of work and that her bees would need to heal me before I could wake and start to heal on the outside. Then I was laid down and thousands of bees swarmed me. They entered my body and exited my body in a fury for several moments. I still to this day get phantom sensations from the bees buzzing and the feelings I had of them entering and exciting my body. They did so though my ear, nose, and throat physically and swarmed consistently all around my entire body.  
   NDE due to severe car crash at age 15.  Remarkable healing during NDE.   

    4036.    Samuel C FDE      10/20/2015.      FDE 7813.           I believe I felt someone with me, but nowhere in particular; it seemed all around me. Then, in front of me, what appeared to be old opera drapes (the thick, heavy ones with the dark folds inward and the equally heavy outward folds). The outer folds appeared to be lit by a light coming from the left perpendicular to the 'drapes'. The drapes appeared to be lit on the outer folds by a reddish light- I don't know if the drapes were reddish or if the light was reddish (and I could see the wooden paneling through them). As I stood there looking at them, the ice cube must have cleared my airway. It seemed at I went from looking at the drapes to facing the other way instantly, and being a little farther away from the wall. I'd guess the whole incident took maybe 20 seconds or so, so I don't believe lack of oxygen could have played a part in this experience.        

    4035.    John S NDE      10/20/2015.      NDE 7810.           A disembodied voice whispered in my ear. 'Why do we live?'  A warmness filled the air around me. 'We live to be a part of something much greater than ourselves,  to become part of every life and everything,' I replied.  I felt the presence move.  Faintly, I made out a shadowy figure outlined in the rain.  It pointed to my lifeless body. 'Man,' it stated, 'was put on this earth for one reason. To find their own way in their own life.  What does this mean to you?' it's voice now booming and filling my ears. 'It means there is no such thing as a useless life, no such thing as a pawn. We are born to fail only so we can learn." Laughter like lightning cracked the air; to an extent I could feel the energy and smell the electronically charged air. 'I have admired your way of thinking for some time now young one, but now it's time to return to the world of the living.  Do not fret . I will be watching you, as I have always.'  
   NDE due to auto accident and knife injury with remarkable spiritual dialogue.   

    4034.    Trinjntje NDE      10/18/2015.      NDE 7803.        From the Netherlands.  Original in Dutch, translated to English by Garry.     I was knocked unconscious, for how long, I don't know. I was in a field which was quite dark and grey. There were hills, it seemed hazy and in that field were two younger men. We needed water, I must look for water! Then I came to, I had hit my head on the dashboard.  
   NDE from an auto accident.   

    4033.    Anne NDE      10/11/2015.      NDE 7805.        From the Netherlands.  Translated into English by her daughter, Kat.     Next to her, on her left hand side, she knew someone was sitting and 'driving' her.  But for some reason, she couldn't move her head to the left; she could only look to her right and to the front. The vehicle had no roof. She was sitting in a chair. I asked my mom if the vehicle looked like a car, but my mother wasn't sure, it was just something that looked like a car, but was floating or gliding over the road. Next to the road there was a pavement with people walking in slow peace.  A bit further she saw green grass, trees and in the distance beautiful detached houses. The road the vehicle was moving on had high trees on both sides. The people who walked on the pavement looked all very happy. Some of them waved to my mom and smiled.  
   Daughter shares her mother’s NDE due to fall with head injury.   

    4032.    Laura NDE      10/11/2015.      NDE 7804.           I felt my soul leave my body.  Suddenly, I was across the room watching the entire scene.  As I looked at the bright golden light, I was standing there wondering if I should stay on earth or go Home.  At this time, I didn't feel any pain and I felt at peace. I was facing the light about to go Home, then the next thing I know, I was being pulled back into my body. I breathed deep, arched my back, and came back to consciousness.  
   NDE due to loss of unconsciousness from unknown cause.   

    4031.    Goldie T NDE      10/11/2015.      NDE 7799.           A black circle appeared; at first it was small and then it grew larger. I could pass beside it, around it, and behind it , yet it looked the same.  Then I entered the black circle that turned into a tunnel with a light at the end. There was no pain.  The light was comforting, entirely comforting and welcoming.  I went toward it. Around me was darkness and a void.  It was kind of like a tunnel. I was heading for the light when I heard my sister call my name.  
   NDE due to suicide attempt at age 17.   

    4030.    Gianluca Probable NDE      10/11/2015.      Probable NDE 7796.        From Italy.  Original in Italian.     After struggling so hard, I relaxed and faced the surface of the water above.  In an instant, I saw my whole life in a very fast and yet very clear fashion. I remember the mostly orange color of this movie.  Then I found myself in pitch darkness, but I was relaxed.  
   Probable NDE due to drowning.   

    4029.    Katie W NDE      10/11/2015.      NDE 7795.           When I got there, I saw a line of people waiting in a white room that didn't seem to have borders or lines.  The light of the room was an unnatural but beautiful and comforting light. Just when I thought to myself, 'Wow there are lines even in heaven,' I was immediately sitting with my knees to my chest.  I was with Jesus who was also sitting the same way. He was tall with beautiful, tan skin.  His eyes were the most vibrant green-blue that I had never seen.  His eyes looked like jewels.  They were so full of love and I felt full of love and comfort, acceptance and utter joy. I saw myself in a glorified type of body. My hair was thick and long; my blue eyes were even more blue and my skin was flawless. Jesus took my hand and said, 'Look.'  
   NDE due to suicide attempt.   

    4028.    Amber I NDE      10/4/2015.      NDE 7791.           I was outside of my body and looking at my body from above.  I remember trying hard to get my body to cooperate without success.  My dad was speaking to Marty and saying that I was very ashen.  I was watching and listening to his remarks from the corner of the wall and ceiling.  I could see the pain on his face.  I could feel all fear, confusion and frustration that was residing within him.  He was fearful at the thought of loosing me.  I wanted to reassure him that I was fine.  My physical body was fine.  I felt no pain and had no fear.  I was not physically suffering and wanted him to know this.  I wanted to relieve his pain and reassure him.  
   NDE due to auto accident at age 16.   

    4027.    Kyal L Probable NDE      9/29/2015.      Probable NDE 7787.        From Australia     My entire life, child to that present moment was rushing behind my eyes. I couldn't cling to any memories but I knew it was the whole lot, just like a quick speed film reel. It had caught me off guard, only really realizing that I was dying and what was going on when I was already half way though my life recall. I thought to myself 'why am I experiencing this', then I drew the connection, I must have shocked myself when I turned off my lamp. I layed there like 'wow I am going to die' and saw that I would leave the entire planet behind, leave my family behind and there was no going back. The ringing in my ears and the feeling I had was very familiar and I was shown in my life recall that I also electrocuted myself when I was little on an old heater. The light tunnel pulled me in and I felt absolute comfort and love and absolute oneness and bliss, no pain, no hatred, love. PURE LOVE real love.  
   Frightening probable NDE that happened about a year ago due to electrocution.  This is hard to tell if it is actually electrocution or if it is a spiritually transformative event brought on from depression.  He still suffers from severe depression, so professional help and time could help him better integrate his experience.   

    4026.    Becca S Probable NDE      9/25/2015.      Probable NDE 23057.           I was one of the first open-heart surgery cases.  I remember rising out of my bed and seeing myself lying there.  There was no noise and no sense of time.  I didn't understanding why I was above myself and seeing myself lying there.  I felt like I was in limbo.  I also felt like this was such a very peaceful existence that I didn't want to go back.  I remember an impression, not a voice, that communicated, 'There is something you have to do yet.'  I was being gently, but firmly, pushed back.   I remember almost everything exactly as it happened 48 years ago.  
   Probable NDE associated with open heart surgery at age 15.  Shared 48 years after experience.   

    4025.    Paul K FDE      9/25/2015.      FDE 7786.        From the UK.     While in the midst of what seemed like an eternity of noise and pain, it was actually around 10 seconds.  I felt an overwhelming calm and knowledge of what was going to happen.  Initially I thought that was not too bad.  Then I heard noises and felt impact and pain.  My brain wanted it to end, which it did soon after.  The strangest of feelings was knowing that I was not going to die and that I would get up.  Blackness surrounded me, but a guidance of wellbeing was apparent. I felt some one was there to guide me through this experience.  
   Fear-death experience with motorcycle crash.  Remarkably, shared five days after experience occurred.   

    4024.    Thomas M NDE      9/24/2015.      NDE 7785.        From Mexico     I was beaten by three aggressors and I went into cardiac respiratory failure... I was floating above my body, my first reaction was to tell my self to move but my body refused the order. I don't know how long it took but I finally realized that I was dead. With this realization came a feeling of extreme distress, kempt worrying and wondering what to do about next.  At this time a voice came to me from somewhere and it told me to stop worrying as all my troubles had staid behind with my body. After this I felt a sense of wellbeing that I never felt before or since, it felt like I had been caring the weight of the world on my shoulders and someone had liberated me of this burden.  After this I went through the ceiling and entered some type of tunnel where I traveled at extreme speed.  All I have related to this time felt completely real, but what happened next felt like a dream. In this dream my sister and grandmother came to me and told me that it was not yet my time, with this dream I awoke, apparently I had been taken to a nearby clinic where I had been resuscitated.  
   NDE due to criminal attack.   

    4023.    Joseph C NDE      9/20/2015.      NDE 7780.           Then they handed me over to Jesus.   When I was in heaven, or some may term it something else, I saw angels and God.  God communicated directly and through an Angel. I saw biblical people I had not learned of yet.   At another point closer to the beginning I think, I was in a court setting for my life review.  I was shown what happened to me, my life, my sins, my love, and forgiveness of others by me. I cried for my sins, my shame, and my repentance. I was very shameful, mortified and sorry.  At one point, I saw where my physical body was being healed.  
   NDE due to apparent post-operative complications at age 8.   

    4022.    William L NDE      9/20/2015.      NDE 7779.           When I reach the cove, there are several shapes coming to me.  I realize the closest shape as my grandfather who starts laughing and telling me that, 'All is well.'  The others people don't allow me to see their faces.  I asked who they are and why I can't see them.  All my grandfather said was that they loved me and wanted me to know that.  Being adopted, I think they may be biologically associated to me, but I don't know for sure. Soon, my grandfather said it was time to go.  I gave no thought about the physical place I just was in.  Earth never crossed my mind.  I was home and wanted to stay.  
   NDE due to being hit in chest.   

    4021.    Yann D Experience      9/20/2015.      Anesthesia 7777.        From France.  Original in French, translated to English by Marguy.     Without transition I found myself instantly in outer space. This space was of an ebony blackness without the slightly bluish tone of our night sky. Nevertheless, this immensity wasn't opaque, nor was it dark. The blackness had an intrinsic quality of light that allowed one to grasp its infinite extent.  A multitude of stars filled this space. Their number was quite superior to the stars that one can see at night. They were very large, but distant, and having variable sizes. Their luminosity was a lively white, of a brightness that could be compared to a mix of chromium and diamond.  
   Possible NDE from anesthesia prior to surgery.   

    4020.    Beh E Probable NDE      9/16/2015.      Probable NDE 7687.        Non-Western.  From Iran.  Original in Persian.  Translated to English by Angel.     I was floating, something like floating on water. As a result of sea waves, I moved accidentally toward up, down, left, or right. I had a tendency to move upward but it was really hard. On top, there was a large rectangle which was divided into two parts from the middle. It was exactly like a window without any glass, which you could pass through it and enter to the other side. In the right half part, all things were in red color but I couldn't look and see what was in it because it seemed like something stopped me from doing that. However, what was in the left half of the rectangle was unexpected and beyond my imagination. It was a blue sky color with land covered with flattened grass, a Christian cemetery, and graves with crosses. It was obvious that it belonged to Christians. There shouldn’t have been any graves in that world.  
   Probable NDE with unexpected and atypical imagery.   

    4019.    Cristine H Experience      9/14/2015.      SOBE 23053.           I took notice of the flowers, of how they were alive and they were immersed in a love that was pure. To this day I can cry thinking of it. The garden’s colors were also alive with hues that made every other colors at ‘home’ dull. The flowers moved as if a gentle wind always was present. It was sunny but the sun never hurt my eyes. The temperature was perfect and I felt a sense of wellbeing as I never have. The sun lit up the petals and wings, making them transparent and I would fly in to enjoy the intricate designs (like I did inside the kaleidoscope)

    4016.    Alessandra P NDE      9/9/2015.      NDE 7773.        From Italy.  Original in Italian, translated to English.     I lost consciousness and I saw myself from above, about two meters away, collapsed and with the syringe into my arm, and my friend trying to revive me. Then I found myself in a dark place, a tunnel with a fearful look. At its bottom, far away, I could see a light and I wished I could reach it, but it was as if I were chained to something: at my feet I had something like huge metal shoes, very heavy, that prevented me from moving.  
   NDE due to drug overdose.   

    4015.    Laura C NDE      9/9/2015.      NDE 7775.           I had an MRI to look for problems with my spinal cord.  For this test, a very small amount of MRI contrast is injected into the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) space. I was given an incorrect dose (way more than I should have gotten).  This caused me to start vomiting and to be unable to talk, walk, or move. I was unconscious much of the time until several hours later a drain was put in that drained the contrast out.  During this unconscious time, I started floating around in darkness.  In the darkness, I could see 2 lights.  They were both shaped the same and one was under the other.  They looked like arcs of light, the left side being more rounded and the right side more pointed. They weren't labeled and had nothing visible to distinguish them.  I floated over to the top beam of light.  It seemed to represent positive things like love, kindness, gratitude and warmth.  In my mind I labeled it 'the positive'.  I then floated down to the lower beam of light.  It seemed to represent negative things like greed, hate, terror, dishonesty, etc.  I labeled it 'the negative'.  
   NDE due to overdose of MRI contrast injected into cerebrospinal fluid.  Shared within two weeks of the time the experience occurred.   

    4014.    Lisa F Probable NDE      9/9/2015.      Probable NDE 7774.           I was repulsed at this vision, until I saw my daughter, who was then 5 years old, sitting by herself playing on the 'beach'.  This is when I realized that I was not looking at hell, which was my first assumption, but that I was looking at earth.  It was then that I realized that I had my oars, and that I had the choice to go back to earth to be her mother again.  I realized that she was the only reason that I needed to be on earth.  I realized that I could choose to go to heaven though.  It was all my choice.  If I did not row, I would naturally be taken to heaven.  It did not take me any time at all to grab my oars and start rowing with all my might to my daughter.  I was heartbroken that I was unable to go to heaven, but I also knew that I would just be going there LATER, when my work on earth was done.  I was angry at my daughter for existing.  I kept thinking things like, 'because of YOU I have to come back to this horrible place!!!'  I had to fight the currents of the water very, very hard to move the boat toward earth.  
   Probable NDE due to carbon monoxide poisoning.   

    4013.    Deborah H NDE      9/9/2015.      NDE 7772.           I was drowning and I left my body and as I was ascending I saw a binder come in front of me with big metal rings on it and many pages of the binder turned in front of my eyes with everything that I had ever done wrong, as innocent as I may have been at 7 years old, I had obviously done many things that were not acceptable (like curse, kick an animal and more) the pages on that binder turned so fast it was hard to imagine how my brain was processing all that information but somehow I knew every item that I was being judged for and I felt so bad for what I done.  Then I flew very quickly through a worm hole like cloud to a grayish like..... slowly spinning tunnel with large soft grayish looking clouds padding the inside of the spiral tunnel formation.  There I was alone at the base of the tunnel and I could see a light at the end and I also saw what I thought was a female form that looked like my Aunt that had passed away, she was inside the tunnel turning away from me and she floated away towards the light. I was very frightened and very, very aware of my surroundings. I was suddenly and very quickly pushed backwards by some unseen force and I woke-up at the beach being worked on by my brothers that were pushing the water out of my lungs.  
   NDE at age 7 due to drowning.   

    4012.    GaeLawree C NDE      9/9/2015.      NDE 7771.           I then left my body and went into a tunnel of very bright light. It was very peaceful, a feeling of ecstacy, peace love and belonging. I saw different levels or scenes of, time, I am not sure, it was like glimpses of time. I was given natural knowledge of things I was not taught on earth. I came to a place, it was a place of energy, I was met by my maternal grandfather. He greeted me, and there were others that I knew. They were all energy, all of them, they had no physical bodies but I knew them, recognized them, each one. A huge energy swept around us. I believed this to be God. He told me I had to go back. I told me I would experience great pain but I would come through it, I knew He would take care of me there. I immediately went back down, in fraction of an instant.  
   NDE at age 16 due to head injury from motorcycle accident.   

    4011.    James D Probable NDE      9/3/2015.      Probable NDE 7768.           I suddenly became aware that I was outside of my body and looking down at it from the ceiling. I felt panic and tried to return to my body, but to no avail. I then noticed a blackness surrounding me with a light in the distance. As the light got closer the panic was replaced by love times-a-thousand. I communicated with whatever it was through thought. No words were spoken but I understood perfectly. I was informed that it wasn't my time. I felt like I was caught trying to cut class.  It was like I was trying to get away with something, yet the Being had so much love and understanding like a parent has for a child.  I pleaded not to return but the presence in the light reached out and guided me back into my body.  
   Probable NDE associated with kidney failure.  Apparent remarkable healing after experience.   

    4010.    Adelheid L Probable NDE      8/29/2015.      Probable NDE 7762.        Original in German, translated to English by Marguy     I was lying in the lap of a young man and he said, 'Have no fear you are safe here'. I had no pain anymore and no fear. It was very silent around us, until from the left side small ribbons with an open mouth passed by, where one mouth turned towards me, and smiled as if it would know me. When the young man and I were alone again, the sun was shining from the right side, otherwise it was dark around us. Then I wanted to know who the young man was.  
   NDE after surgery   

    4009.    Laura NDE      8/29/2015.      NDE 7763.        From France.  Original in French, translated to English by Marguy     Then I saw both, the nurses and the doctors, clearly while their faces had a panicked look. I had a view on the heart monitor from above. I heard each of the staff's comments as they also saw the curves on the monitor. I heard that they were talking about me like I was dead. They said things like, 'Oh she must have been beautiful this woman, with her curly hair. The worst is that we will have to inform the elderly man. Do you think it's her husband?' When one replied, 'No, he is too old. He must be her father and the young man by his side, must be his son,' I became aware that my life was at risk.  
   NDE from heart problems.   

    4008.    John D NDE      8/29/2015.      NDE 7764.           I feel this quote from the 1990s film 'Jacob's Ladder' explains this moment better than I could: 'The only thing that burns in hell, is the part of you that won't let go of your life. Your memories, your attachments, they burn them all away. 'But they're not punishing you,' he said. 'They're freeing your soul.' If you're frightened of dying and you're holding on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. But, if you've made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the Earth. It's just a matter of how you look at it that's all. So don't worry, okay?'  
   Very brief NDE due to faint and seizure.  Shared 8 days after its occurrence.   

    4007.    Mike G NDE      8/29/2015.      NDE 23049.           I saw myself through someone else's eyes.  This person was in a large barn structure covering about a 100 yard area.  The whole view black and grey.  There were a couple hundred figures walking around taking tiny steps with their heads looking down. I was seen about 10 yards in the foreground, but I was seen in color. I was wearing a red shirt and had a yellow beam of light from the top of my head going upwards.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest.  Very atypical NDE content.  Shared just days after experience occurred.   

    4006.    Frank L Probable NDE      8/24/2015.      Probable NDE 7761.           I was above myself and floating upward. I was at peace and felt no pain. The nurses were around me.  The doctor was sitting there looking up at me smiling. It was like 3D, so clear and vivid. I could see every detail of his face. Then he put his hands on my chest, still smiling and said, 'Not yet.' At the same time that he said this, his face just melted.  I saw this so clearly, that it was a little creepy but I was not scared at all.  
   Probable NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    4005.    Marta M NDE      8/23/2015.      NDE 7760.        From Japan     I was still being pulled deeper and deeper into the ocean but this alien calm came over me. I wasn't suffering or suffocating. My 'guardian angel' was at my right. I knew this but couldn't see him.  He introduced himself to me earlier. He talked to me telepathically and I could hear him with no other sound. He said I've done much good in my life and I could go.  Because of that reason and that I wouldn't suffer, they'd put me to 'sleep' before I felt anything. He also said I accomplished my mission but that my life force was diminishing.  If I stayed, things would be an effort and become very hard.  
   NDE due to drowning.   

    4004.    Josh J Probable NDE      8/23/2015.      Probable NDE 7759.           There was no light or pearly gates.  I think this was probably because I was in some sort of purgatory.  Even so, the peace I felt was like nothing I have ever experienced before or since. There, I got into a conversation with a male-voiced 'Entity.' In my opinion, it was God or an Angel. The Entity told me that it was not my time but that I could 'go' if I wanted to. I immediately told the Entity that I wanted to go. The Entity then mentioned how this would irreparably hurt my Mother. I quickly changed my mind and said that I would stay.  
   Probable NDE due to suicide attempt.   

    4003.    Richard M NDE      8/23/2015.      NDE 7756.        From France. Original in French, translated into English by Marguy.     I immediately left my body, seeing my double on the bed. I was caught up towards the sky.  I found myself crossing a black tunnel, but the tunnel was not made of matter.  It is difficult to describe; there was a sound or a kind of music the whole time of crossing. I saw an intense light at the end of the tunnel.  The light was not aggressive.  I was a good light that I had absolutely no fear of.  I was aware of this goodness, of this very restful state.  As I approached the end of the tunnel, I saw a silhouette. As I got about two or three meters from the silhouette, it lifted its arm and pointed its finger towards the other end of the tunnel, where I had come from.  I found myself projected with the speed of light, if I can say so, into my body.  
   NDE from chest pain and fainting on the bed.   

    4002.    Simon C NDE      8/23/2015.      NDE 7755.        From France. Original in French, translated into English by Marguy.     I saw from above that the surgeon was operating on me.  I saw everything in detail that he did.  I saw my father who had been deceased for 2-1/2 years.  He told me that my time had not yet come and that my mother and sister still needed me.  
   NDE from auto accident.   

    4001.    Serena NDE      8/23/2015.      NDE 7753.        From Italy.  Original in Italian, translated to English.     I remember PERFECTLY that I entered a dark tunnel. I was blissfully flying, laughing and happy like I never have experienced before. Around me it seemed to be snowing. I was flying.  The air was cool and I could hear happy laughter. I don't know what blocked me, what or who sent me back.  
   NDE from a seizure triggered by looking at Christmas lights.   

    4000.    Emelie M Shared Death Experience      8/23/2015.      Shared Death 32380.        From France. Original in French, translated into English by Marguy.     This golden light radiated such an intense joy that I had the impression that on my face a big smile was forming, covering my face completely. This immense joy, I had never experienced on earth. Yet, the joy was familiar to me and was putting a comforting balm on my heart, instantly wiping out my suffering. Inside of the ball were two bright forms with vague outlines. I could only see the form of a head and chest; I saw neither arms nor legs. It were as if they were looking at me through a window. The being of light at the right seemed female to me. She was like a guide accompanying my friend, who was at the left from my viewpoint. It communicated with me by thought, 'There is a dear being that wants to see you a last time.' I sensed a feeling of compassion and sadness for our earthly sufferings, coming from the guide. I immediately reached towards the light, with what I think was my 'energetic hand.' I grabbed a protuberance resembling a hand of golden light, that came out of the light ball.  
   Shared Death Experience with a friend.   

    3999.    Sergio S NDE      8/22/2015.      NDE 7751.        From Peru. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Sean.     Next, images of my mother and daughter appeared, as if I was thinking about them.  Again, I said, 'I HAVE TO RETURN.' This time, I was able to break the transparent film.  I appeared in a very bright tunnel.  It looked like luminous acrylic paints of different colors were falling.  I went through the tunnel.  I felt very happy and was aware that I was returning.  
   NDE from allergic reaction to antibiotics.   

    3998.    Vikki H NDE      8/20/2015.      NDE 7752.           I found myself in total darkness with no contact to the earth. I was extremely happy and content. I knew who I was and had no fear. I did not care about the past and only wanted to continue being extremely content. Over the next half hour, one sense came back at a time.  This happened very slowly until I was in a lot of pain.  
   NDE due to criminal attack with head injury.   

    3997.    Erica P NDE      8/15/2015.      NDE 7750.           As I went further up the tunnel the light got bigger and brighter. Then I was in the throne room of God. Jesus Christ was seated next to God. The throne room was pure white. Then I stood there in absolute awe at the beauty of Jesus. Jesus was wearing a white robe with a purple sash and had flames in his eyes. His gold crown had many bright jewels in it purple green red. Then I looked back at Jesus and his sash then turned red and looking into His eyes I saw forever in them. He was so beautiful. Then I remember bowing before Jesus and God.  
   NDE due to overdose of medication.   

    3996.    Tristan JCG Probable NDE      8/15/2015.      Probable NDE 7749.        From the UK.     I can remember that I was seeing reality became liquid and that all the colors on earth were traveling with my presence inside of it.  I was traveling at high speed through some sort of pipeline leading to a hole.  I was like a swirl such as like water being sucked down a hole in the sink. Once I was through the hole, I heard several noises like I was going through a sound barrier 'bof, bof, bof.'  I was tumbling and had difficulty flying straight like I was in space. I remember being very cold. I could hear myself thinking, 'It's so cold.' I felt frightening for a second. Then I saw what looked like a black hole.  I reminded me of the movie 'Contact' with Jody Foster. I saw flashes of very blight light.  I did not want to go through the back hole but I had to go.  I had no choice in the matter.  
   Probable NDE due to heart attack.   

    3995.    Fred B Ketamine      8/15/2015.      Drug Experience 7748.        From Canada.     After being diagnosed with mild Asperger syndrome in 2006, I started using recreational ketamine for about 3 years. As you know, a lot of NDE have been reported by ketamine users in the past.  And of course, they also happened to me.  
   Here are several Ketamine experiences.  It is up to the reader to determine if NDEs are "brain chemistry."   

    3994.    Jeanne MK NDE      8/15/2015.      NDE 7747.           I thought, 'What on earth are those people doing?' as I watched them racing around my shell of a body with the shock paddles trying to get my heart started again. I remember laughing and thought, 'Oh, no. I'm out of here.'  Then I was where someone was showing a very negative side of where people could go and stay. I just knew that I had to be the wrong place and I said, 'Please not me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for anything I have ever done.' All of a sudden, I was floating down this mother of pearl path.  I was moving and the path was so much more beautiful because it had colors in it that I don't think I could ever begin to describe.  I moved to a path where people were walking.  Some of these people I knew from before came to me and asked me, 'Do you want to go see the buildings?' Of course I said, 'Yes.'  
   NDEs due to unknown illness resulting in cardiac arrests.   

    3993.    Duane S NDE      8/15/2015.      NDE 7743.           As I was shown around, it was explained to me how most of our celestial, eternal knowledge is blanked-out during our chosen life spans on earth. We must temporarily forget most of what our higher-self already knows so we can immerse ourselves in the roles we have chosen to play. Furthermore, they said that it might take a while for all my knowledge and memories to return.  To ease the transition back into this realm, I was told to think of my time on earth as an extended visit to the ultimate theme park. Consider it a place with thrilling rides and various adventures that I could choose to experience or not. I was also reminded that the reason we leave the celestial realm at all was for the excitement, variety, adventure, and entertainment that different incarnations offer. However, to take all our celestial knowledge with us on our various adventures would have ruined the very experience that we had chosen to live. Someone there said that I should think of our trips to other realms as choosing a new novel to read. I can choose a new book, depending on what I am in the mood for. Furthermore, if I knew every turn and twist of the story, line by line, prior to reading it, it would spoil the fun.  
   Astonishing exceptional NDE due to illness.   

    3992.    Stephanie P NDE      8/14/2015.      NDE 7746.           I believe I lost consciousness but remember everything around me being bright white light. I was above my body and could see myself being wheeled out to the ambulance. I was not moving but remember seeing myself there. It was all okay though. I was calm and felt at peace with not coming back. Relaxed and like everything was going to be fine from now on because all the other stuff didn't matter anymore.  
   Two severe asthma attacks and associated experiences described.   

    3991.    Mohammad Z NDE      8/14/2015.      NDE 16083.        Non-western NDE from Iran. Original in Farsi, translated to English by Amir.     One example of my life review was when I was a little kid. We were traveling by car and stopped somewhere along the way. There was a river not far from the road and I was asked to go and bring some water in a bucket from that river. I went to fill up the bucket but on my way back, I felt that the bucket was way too heavy for me.  I decided to empty some of the water to make the bucket lighter. Instead of emptying the water right there, I noticed a tree that was alone by itself in a dry patch of land. I took the effort to go out of my way to that tree and emptied some of the water at the tree base. I even waited there a few seconds to make sure the water is soaked in the soil and is absorbed. In my life review, I received such an applaud and joy for this simple act that it is unbelievable. It was like all the spirits in the Universe were filled with joy from this simple act and were telling me we are proud of you. That simple act seemed to be one of the best things I had ever done in my life! This was strange to me, because I didn’t think this little act was a big deal and thought I had done much more important and bigger things. However, it was shown to me that what I had done was extremely valuable because I had done it purely from the heart, with absolutely no expectation for my own gain.  
   Exceptional Muslim NDE from an auto accident.   

    3990.    Marcel W NDEs      8/13/2015.      NDEs 7729.        From the Netherlands. Original in Dutch, translated to English by Garry.     On those five occasions I left my body and wanted to be near that curtain because it gave that fine, warm love feeling. It was during those times I would have not a single form of pain and this was very pleasant and inviting. Then I would hear rhythmic ringing leading me away from the curtain and slipping back into my painfull body. The rythmic noises were so loud that I would "have" to listen, and then it would lessen. In retrospect I came to the conclusion that my guides and Holy guardian were making sure I returned to earth and wouldn't let me pass by the curtain.  
   NDEs from aorta dissection and apparently died 5 times.   

    3989.    Jeff D NDE      8/11/2015.      NDE 7745.           Soon, I started experiencing a calmness that was totally out of the norm; especially considering that I had just physically assaulted my assailant, forcing him to flee. As the calmness and totally peacefully feeling progressed, I soon saw my father along with another person that I could not identify. My father had died 30 years earlier and I was elated to see him. However, the shooting occurred in my next-door neighbor's front yard.  My 11-year-old daughter was inside my house during the shooting. I began praying as loud as I could, asking Jesus to let me live for the sake of my daughter. One of the neighbors had worked in the local Memphis Trauma Unit and she has stated that she believed that I was gone as well as stating that she could not hear my prayer.  After asking Jesus to spare me, all the pain returned.  
   NDE due to being shot multiple times.   

    3988.    Caroline J Probable NDE      8/11/2015.      Probable NDE 7744.           I was with my paternal grandmother, who had died ten years before I was born. I felt so much love and so safe. I was SO disappointed when I came back into my body.  
   Probable NDE due to reaction from medication during surgery at age 4.  Shared 52 years later.   

    3987.    Frank H NDE      8/10/2015.      NDE 7740.           I can remember a brief moment of darkness.  Then I was in a room.  But not really a room.  It was just a big open space with a pure white background and glow.  I was not aware of a body and I floated into the space but yet I did not feel that I was floating.  I was not standing on anything.  I was floating towards a group of people who were out of focus.  I could not identify who they were, but they were dressed in regular clothing.  One person was yelling at me, 'You're not suppose to be here.'  I was still a distance away from them.  Then in a flash, I was aware of my surroundings and watching the gentleman who was giving me CPR.  I heard my wife telling me, 'Please don't leave me!'  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest.  Shared within two weeks of time NDE occurred.   

    3986.    Denise Probable NDE      8/10/2015.      Probable NDE 7741.        From France.  Original in French, translated to English by Marguy.     I review my life, from my infancy until the meeting with my fiancé. The flashes are not flashes, but they resemble big pictures with golden frames and very beautiful moldings. I'm visiting the gallery of my life. I know that I'm advancing straight forward, pushed by some unfamiliar instinct. There is no space for reason and there is no goal. I have to go forward and that's all. Time doesn't exist. There is no path, yet I know that I'm going straight forward. As a background music I hear the song 'I just call to say I love you'.  
   Nurse's probable NDE.   

    3985.    Martin C NDE      8/10/2015.      NDE 7739.        From Canada.  Original in French, translated to English by Marguy     I spent a short while in blackness because during the experience time doesn't seem to exist. I felt myself rising as if I was in an elevator.  At the beginning I was in blackness and then rose to be in a wonderful park. Everything was beautiful, really beautiful.  More so, where people were there. All seemed happy and well. They didn't pay any attention to me. I felt very well.  There was no pain, not warm nor cold and I felt no fear at all. I simply felt good, as I never had felt before. I took the opportunity of the moment to observe. Then I asked myself what I was doing there.  Immediately I got a multitude of answers.  
   NDE where he was aware he was having a NDE because he had read about it at age 13 or 14.   

    3984.    Barbara T NDEs      8/3/2015.      NDEs 16082.        From Poland.  Original in Polish translated to English by Mal.     I don't remember how I got in the tunnel; I must have been pushed in with some great power. I was moving down the tunnel very fast at 45 degree angle. I heard loud noise that was like ringing and a whirr. I didn't have a body but the feeling of its shape somehow remained. I don't remember what I saw on my way through the tunnel. It's hard to describe. The tunnel ended suddenly and I found myself in big and bright place. I wasn't alone there. I think that on both sides of me there were exits of other tunnels and people that came through them at the same time as I.  
   Two separate NDEs from surgery complications.   

    3983.    Ginny H NDE      8/2/2015.      NDE 7738.           Then I was floating higher until I was surrounded by the whitest, brightest light I have ever seen. I remember thinking, 'Why does this light not hurt my eyes?' At the same time, I felt at peace. I found myself in this space. It was a huge white space. I felt love, comfort, peace, and joy that surrounded me. The feeling was in me, as if I could wrap myself in it and it was Beautiful. I walked forward to a curtain that was a beautiful flowing 'white lace' that was alive. I am not sure I can explain it, but it was like it was breathing. I am not sure how I understood that, but I did. I pushed the curtain aside and walked past it. I found myself in the presence of a male figure in a white gown made of the same material as the white lace curtain.  
   NDE due to respiratory arrest during severe asthma attack.   

    3982.    Joschua B NDE      8/2/2015.      NDE 7737.           I could see myself under the water and I remember feeling no attachment to the body. I floated higher and higher above the scene and could see a great part of the city below me. I still had a human form while floating up, it was like a 'ghost body'. I remember looking up into the sky and then being somewhere else. This place was like being in space except with no stars. Wherever this somewhere was, I had no human form. I was like a small ball of yellow light. Though in darkness, I knew I could see in all directions at once. Around me appeared other orbs of light. The orbs were other people who had passed away. We all glowed with different shades of light. Some were more pink, some were blue and I was yellow. I remember that all of our thoughts flowed into and out of each other simultaneously. Despite this, I could still process my own thoughts. I knew that the lady near me was in her 30s, that she had died in a car accident leaving behind children but she was at peace with the fact that her husband would care for them.  
   Exceptional NDE due to drowning at age 6.   

    3981.    Steven K NDE      7/31/2015.      NDE 7734.           When I went down for the third time, I felt this peaceful consciousness coming over me.  As I looked up from under the water, I cried out to God to save me. It was then that a very bright light appeared in front of me.  I could see what appeared to be a long tunnel with the light at the end of the tunnel. As I floated into this tunnel and towards the bright light, there appeared an individual whom I could not make out.  It was standing at the end and pointed towards the opposite end of the tunnel from where I entered. I had this feeling from him that it wasn't my time yet and I was to go back.

Then I walked up the stairs to a huge Greek building that looks JUST like the Parthenon in Athens, Greece  I went inside and saw the beautiful, white marble flooring. I went down a long hallway and there was a room with thousands of scrolls. I pulled one out to read it. It was writing that I've never seen before. Then the writing disappeared in front of me.

Next thing I knew, my eyes opened up and I'm sitting in the bed with the most golden and brightest, yet warmest, light I have every seen or experienced. It was shining through a window to my left. There was no pain; there was no fear. I felt completely at ease. At this point I felt a slight brush on my left hand.  As I looked to the side of my bed, there was a woman sitting with me. She was completely engulfed in this golden light. I could not make out her face and she wasn't looking at me. She slowly continued to brush my hand over and over again. I attempted to speak, 'Where is my mom?' But she didn't reply.

    3978.    Nancy T NDE      7/26/2015.      NDE 7730.           I felt light, weightless. I felt no stress or pain. I was elevating up into the sky. It was night. There were stars and moonlight. There were other people, lots of souls being elevated into the sky with me. I was not scared. I got to the opening of a long big tunnel. It was dark inside the tunnel but there was a light at the end. It was too far away. At the opening of the tunnel, an old man with a white beard was inspecting the souls and letting people through. But some people needed to go back. When it was my turn, he said to me in Arabic, 'It is too early for you.  You haven't finished yet.'

    3976.    Brian P NDE      7/26/2015.      NDE 7726.        From Canada     I was in a black place that did not feel like a tunnel but was vastly open. I was moving to a 'light' that was not bright but it was golden-soft like a cloud at sunset. I mostly remember the peaceful feeling with no panic; just calm in my mind. I also remember thinking, 'I guess I get to find out what happens now.' I knew I was dead and had no body anymore. I realized that I was not breathing now and also thought about the fact that I was dead and did not care.  I was actually quite calm and in a state of wonder. I thought about the 'cloud' I could see. I wondered why I could see at all. I wondered how fast I was moving as there was no point of reference, but I could feel I was moving for sure. I remember coming to the 'cloud.'  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    3975.    Dave Z Probable NDE      7/14/2015.      NDE 7725.           I was rocketed straight upward to a bright light.  It was like a different galaxy, or some kind of vortex in the sky.  When I hit the light, everything was backwards.  Up became down and I was then racing downward.  As it became closer to earth that was in black and white, I started to see streets and houses.  It felt like a town but when I got closer, the earth then turned to blue and green in color.  Upon impact, the colors expanded into an explosion of blue and green.

    3974.    Stephanie R NDE      7/14/2015.      NDE 7724.           While I was on the other side, I had counsel about whether to go back. It was to be my decision. I would have injuries to deal with. And the dysfunctional life that I came from would still have to be lived. I also knew that I had plans for this life.  I had curiosity and even enthusiasm for coming back. I became aware that the span of a lifetime is a speck compared to a place where time does not exist. I was comforted by knowing that this place, that I was lucky enough to visit, would always be there.  I knew that I would be back someday, at the right time. I decided to complete my life plan. I realized it had been a plan from before this life began. I was given a choice. And I chose to come back.

    3973.    Christian Y NDE      7/11/2015.      NDE 23034.           At this point, I somehow instantly and fully comprehended this as an out of body experience. While sitting there and feeling an overwhelming silence, I felt absolutely no pain. I started to lift of the bench from next to the EMT and floated above everything while looking down. I thought for a very brief moment that I physically started to turn away when I saw they were trying to revive me. Just as I felt myself turn and float through the roof of the ambulance, an extremely loud and physical WOOOOSH threw me right back into my body!

    3972.    Diana Possible NDE      7/11/2015.      Anesthesia 7722.        From Columbia.  Original in Spanish, translated to English by Sean.     I began to feel happy.  I found myself in a garden with beautiful golden yellow flowers, maybe a relative of the sunflower.  I went along touching the flowers with my hands.  I started to feel an indescribable emotion akin to extreme happiness.  As I walked along, I saw in the background  a very bright light.  It was as if looking directly at a spotlight.  It was too strong, but it made me so happy to look at it.  I ran and ran to be with this light because I wanted to stay there forever.

I finally came face to face with God.  He looked into my eyes.  I could tell that he knew everything I had ever done, things I was thinking at that moment, and things I would say or do in the future. You can't lie to God. He was very pleasant and said two things to me. He spoke telepathically from his eyes to mine. He said, 'I'm not ready for you yet.  There are things I want you to do first.' Then I came back to consciousness.

Beyond me, I could see that there was a beautiful setting. It was almost this pristine meadow and water and I wanted to move there. I had this feeling that I needed to move toward that. But as I did, another being approached me, one that was obviously someone that was in charge, someone in authority. And that person said that I couldn’t go on, that I had to return – go back where I’d come from. And he told me that I had a higher purpose to fulfill and that I’d be fulfilling that purpose and that at some point, after that purpose was fulfilled, I would return to that place.

    3969.    Alex H NDE      7/5/2015.      NDE 7717.        From the U.K.     I was looking down from the ceiling of a room at myself. Everything was very white and bright. My body was lying on a surgery-type bed with medical staff around it. One person was trying to wrap a silver blanket over my body and I could clearly hear them saying, 'Breathe, Alex, breathe. Come on, breathe.' Then I took a breathe and was instantly back in my body.

    3968.    Elizabeth T NDE      7/5/2015.      NDE 7716.        Interviewed and transcribed by Amey G.     I saw a light that I can't explain but it was the brightest light I've ever seen. There were two brown-haired children sitting at a table; one was a daughter that I had miscarried and the other was my daughter Michelle L's miscarried son.  They were grown up.  I was happy to see them and they hugged me.  My grandson, he was a little bit bigger than his two brothers on earth.  My daughter Susan, looked just like Michelle her sister.  I didn't know the reason why the miscarriages happened, so always had a sense of worry as to what became of them.  They looked like they were very, very happy, which made me feel a lot better.   Both children looked at me.  My grandson said, 'Grandma, go back, we don't need you.'  My daughter said, 'Ma, we're happy, we don't need you. Go back.'  
   NDE due to complication during surgery.   

    3967.    Katie E NDE      7/1/2015.      NDE 7714.        From the U.K.     I collapsed and hit the back of my head on the pavement and I had a seizure like an epileptic fit for about 2 seconds. After the short fit, which I have never had prior to this event or after, my eyes opened as I gained conciousness to see my boyfriend and two sweet women who had stopped to help. I was only out or a few seconds but I know I travelled to another world which felt like I was there for hours and hours, but I couldn't really put a time duration on it, all I know is it was a lot longer than a few seconds. I have no real memory from the other world that I travelled to just I have the feeling that I travelled through the most beautiful paradise I have ever seen and when I reached the destination I spoke to very wise knowledgeable beings, like God or Jesus. These people gave me knowledge and an understanding of the universe which I wanted to share with people on this earth. Then everything was black again and it felt like all the memories of this beautiful amazing place and the people that I met, all the memories were taken from my mind and it felt like sand falling through my fingers… It felt like they or the other world did not want me to bring the knowledge back and I believe there is a reason for this.
