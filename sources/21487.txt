SOLOMON THE KING
SOLOMON was a King. The son of King David. The wise son of a wise father. A
righteous man’s righteous child. All the incidents in David’s life, all of his characteris­
tics are paralleled in the life of Solomon.
de LAURENCE THE MYSTIC
So it is with de Laurence, all of the knowledge, all of the Ancient Wisdom, Spiri­
tual Powers of the Old Venerable Masters of Occultism and Magic are manifested and
paralleled in the life of de Laurence.
de Laurence has no desire to keep his wisdom and Great Spiritual knowledge locked
up in his own soul; because it would be of no value to any person except himself.
When he wrote and published his famous Occult and Spiritual books, men in all parts
of the world became acquainted with his wonderful abilities as a teacher, and writer.
The true teachings contained in his books has increased the information of those who
have studied them. So great has become his reputation that several Occult Temples in
certain parts of the world have been named after him. Again, any one in doubt con­
cerning the meaning of Spirit Phenomena or the interpretation of a dream, has sought
de Laurence’s advice.
Other writers and teachers have attempted to interest the people, but the
majority of them have turned to de Laurence whom they understand with ease
and have no trouble in comprehending his teachings, de Laurence always re­
moves the difficulties from the paths of the student.
A Very Learned And Advanced Occult Student In Speaking Of de Lau­
rence Said: “Books by other writers are not near as instructive, neither do they teach
the student like de Laurence does. Their writings are ambiguous, de Laurence, how­
ever, introduces certain explanation suited to the comprehension of all, through which
means a knowledge of Occult Laws and Spiritual Powers become readily obtainable.”
de Laurence’s Spirit Declaration Scroll has solved the Mystery of Mysteries for Con­
juration and Citation of Spiritual Forces. FIis Scroll has not only solved The Mystery,
but has made Communication with the Spiritual World a very easy and simple matter.
It became known several years ago that de Laurence -was working on a
very Secret matter, and it was talked about that he was creating something
which had been shown him in a Vision by an Old Egyptian Adept. It is now
known that he has been, for several years, constructing a SPIRIT DECLARA­
TION SCROLL that would be valuable and useful to every student of Spiritism
and Occultism. Strange as this statement may seem to some, de Laurence like
other Great Mystics receive instructions by Vision and it was in a Vision while
he lay in a deep Spirit Trance, that this Marvelous Scroll was shown to him,
and he was instructed from the Spirit World how to create it.
THE MAGIC WAND OF MIRACLES
de LAURENCE’S SPIRIT DECLARATION SCROLL is Marvelous and Most
Useful for those engaged in the Practice of Spiritualism, or the Operation of Occultism
and Magic. It is also of great use for those who desire to overcome the Arts of Witches,
Conjurers, Evil Spirits, and Spells. It teaches the Secret Procedure of Occultism and
explains its Hidden Mysteries and Magical Rites.
Divine Mysteries and Spiritual Powers have concerned men in all ages of the
World. Many today possess Spirit Sight. Others have in their possession the Magic
Wand to work Miracles. There are still others who understand Oracles, and are able
to interpret Dreams and explain Visions. And, again, there are many who really are
sincere in their desire to develop their Spiritual Forces, and also to understand how to
protect themselves from Evil Spirits, Sorcery and Witchcraft. Others want to under­
stand Occult Binding, so as to constrain a person and prevent them from doing certain
things. Again, there are people who desire to receive Fore-Warnings and understand
Divination.
Remember nobody else has ever created anything like it, and we have so many testi­
monials from those who have used it that we would be tinable to publish them. Easy
To Operate. Full directions sent with Scroll.

Upon it are reproduced in beautiful Oriental Colors, Three very
striking Half-Tone Illustrations. The First shows an Operator Invoking
a Spirit. The Second is one of the most Striking Illustrations ever seen.
It is in Oriental Colors and shows the MYSTERY OF ALL MYS­
TERIES. The Third Illustration is also very wonderful and striking as
it shows the INVOCATION OF A SPIRIT IN A GRAVE YARD
AT NIGHT.
LOWER BACK SECTION OF THE SCROLL. The lower BACK
Section is 15 % by 24 Inches. It is Dead Black and is used for writing
down SPIRIT MESSAGES or any questions you wish to ask your Spirit

means, be in a position to protect themselves and remain safe
from Evil Spirits; all Enemies; Visible or Invisible, Living or
Dead. They should, if they are careful in all their undertakings,
become more prosperous; acquire success and be able to operate
wonderful things through the Divine Spirit. Those who are pos­
sessed of Spirit and Divine Power should not only be able to oper­
ate strange and wonderful things but also discover the Secret
Counsels of Men; to overcome Enemies; to obtain favors from
friends and those in power; to Fore-tell Future Events; to see and
know things done behind their back, or many miles away; to be
informed of things in Dreams; to obtain knowledge from Spirits;
to gain Secret Occult Powers; to Heal Disease, and as Jesus said:
"DO GREATER THINGS THAN I.”
THE ALTERNATE USE OF OCCULT FORCES
As stated on another page, de LAURENCE’S SPIRIT DECLARA­
TION SCROLL HAS A DOUBLE ADMINISTRATION, that is, there
are TWO each of the Symbols and Inscriptions; for in nature there is
use for contrary Occult or Hidden Forces such as, Warmth and Cold,
Mildness and Severity, Love and Anger, Light and Darkness. Nothing
induces us towards Joy so effectually as Sorrow; nothing is nearer to
Sorrow than Joy. Hence the uninstructed operator is astounded to
(earn that de LAURENCE’S TRUE SPIRIT DECLARATION
SCROLL HAS A DOUBLE ADMINISTRATION.

Testimony For Spirit Declaration Scroll
To illustrate. A lady, whose name we prefer to withhold, came to America
from Europe with her brother who later became separated from her. She en­
deavored for several years to locate him. Finally she heard of de Laurence’s
wonderful Scroll. She obtained one and wrote the following on it: “ Good spirits
and angels, please inform me where my dear brother is.” She then hung the
Scroll up in her room and burned some Candles and Incense for an hour three
consecutive nights between 10 and 11 o’clock. A short time later she was, so she
states, informed in a dream that her brother was in a certain town in Texas and,
if she addressed a letter to him at that town he would receive it. She sent the
letter as directed, and you may imagine her surprise when she received a reply
to it. This statement is positively true and was made by the lady herself
voluntarily. This party ordered Set One.
Another Case. That of a young man who was engaged to be married to a
young lady. For some reason unknown to him she broke the engagement and
refused to marry him. He himself was a believer in Spiritualism and after learn­
ing the details regarding this Occult Scroll, he ordered the Accessories and other
merchandise listed on these pages and obtained the Scroll Absolutely Free of
Charge. After obtaining it, he used the Accessories, that is, the Candles, Incense,
etc., as hereinafter directed and the engagement was renewed and later he married
the young lady. He believed so strongly in the Scroll that he used it with the
greatest faith and as he had obtained it Free of Charge, he was of course very
grateful for the results received. This party ordered Set Three.
Still Another Case. A man who reads his Bible faithfully had read that
Jesus said, “Develop your inner or Spiritual Sight.” He had tried for some
months to develop his Inner or Spiritual Sight and had been unsuccessful. He
had used many methods and was becoming discouraged when he read the particu­
lars regarding de Laurence’s Occult and Spiritual Scroll. He sent an order for
the Occult Accessories and Merchandise, as indicated on another page, and ob­
tained a Scroll FREE OF CHARGE.
He started to experiment with the Scroll hoping that some of his Spirit
friends might materialize to him. He figured that if Christ said, “Develop your
Inner and Spiritual Sight ’ ’ that it meant nothing else but that he, as a man, had
two sights, that is, an Outer and an Inner Sight and, that if he developed the
Inner Sight he would be able to see spiritually and he would observe his helpful
spirits and angel guides with his Inner Sight. He also concluded that Christ
meant that if one’s Inner Sight was developed he would be able to see the things
of the Spiritual 'world as did Swedenborg. Being of a very faithful and religious
nature he carried out the instructions regarding the operation and use of the
Scroll until he was perfectly satisfied that it had been of great assistance to him
in the development of his Spiritual Sight. This party ordered Set One.
A lady whose husband had died wished to dispose of her property.
She had placed it, for several months in the hands of Real Estate Agents, but
they had failed. Being herself a spiritualist and learning of the Scroll she placed
an order for SET TWO of the Occult Accessories, listed on another page, and
obtained her Scroll FREE. She operated it as directed and in a short time sold
her property. This is an actual statement of what occurred. This party ordered
Set Two.
The above statements are true, have not been exaggerated in the least. Indeed, many more
could be added. All we claim is that those who have already ordered the Accessories as listed on
another page, and have used them as directed in connection with the Scroll, seem to be satisfied.
Many state that after writing down on the Scroll some special question they have been given
information regarding the same in a dream or a vision.
There are others who have used the Scroll and Accessories that claim they have proved
invaluable and worth a great deal to them.
de Laurence’s Spirit Declaration Scroll, as stated elsewhere, is sent ABSOLUTELY FREE
to anyone who orders the Accessories listed on another page. It should be noted, however, that
there are THREE DIFFERENT SETS of Accessories and that each set is sold at a different price.
NOTICE. The information tendered here regarding the Scroll and its Accessories has been secured from letters received
from those who obtained and used the Scroll and Accessories. These statements, of course, are not guaranteed, and as stated
above, the information ha>s been drawh- from letters and sources believed to be reliable; but beyond the exercise of all due car©
to insure accuracy in reproducing this information no responsibility or guarantee is assumed by The de Laurence Co.

Testimony For Spirit Declaration Scroll
Thief Detected By Use Of Scroll
The de Laurence Co., Chicago, Ill. Dear Friends: Feb. 1,1928.
I am sending to you for order No. 10. Magic, White and Black, by Franz
Hartman, M. D., which is priced in your Catalogue at $3.25. You will find that
amount in this letter.
1 have not written you since I left New York City, and wish to inform you
that I received the SPIRIT DECLARATION SCROLL safely and I am very
thankful to de Laurence for permitting me to have one of his Wonderful Scrolls.
I assure you that I will always do good with it. I have Operated my Marvel­
ous Scroll only once since I have had it, and the Message that I sent into the
Spiritual World was answered.
Here are the true facts. A lady friend of mine had a Diamond Ring stolen from her on
Christmas Day. and at first I think she suspected me. Of course God knows I was innocent.
I used de LAURENCE’S SPIRIT DECLARATION SCROLL as directed, and the real thief
was caught. (He admitted his guilt, and I was with the lady and a detective when he
admitted his guilt.
Please advise me what color Candles to use for my Higher development, and what kind
of Incense to use for full materialization in the daytime.
In closing I can only say that I am more than pleased with my Spirit Scroll. The most
wonderful part of it is that the Scroll is FREE. It did not cost me any thing. I do not
understand how de Laurence can be so generous as to give away such a Valuable thing as
this Scroll certainly is. I have Set One.
All I was asked to do was to pay for a Set of the Scroll Accessories, consisting of
Special Candles, Incense, Incense Burners, and the Material necessary to operate the
Scroll. Of course anybody would expect to do that anyway under any circumstances.
If I were asked to pay $100.00 for one of these Scrolls I would not hesitate.
Thanking you for all the favors and help that I have received, I am, Sincerely yours,
Albert Bundy, Company No. 10, National Soldiers Home,----------- .
P. S.: I am a member of the Soldiers Home (Name of state deleted), where you
can send my mail. I spend some of my time here as well as at my home, No. 26
Road (Name of town and state deleted).
NOTICE. The above letters are on file in our office. The name of the state where the Soldiers* Home is has been
deleted, that is, not given. However, anyone interested may call at our office at any time and reajd Mr. Bundy’s letter, who
has given us his written consent to publish this testimony.
Helped Play Musical Instrument
The de Laurence Co., Chicago, Ill. Gentlemen: April 1, 1929.
In behalf of myself and dear wife, I desire to inform you that we received SET ONE
of The Spirit Declaration Scroll Accessories, also de Laurence’s wonderful SPIRIT DEC­
LARATION SCROLL. In fact we have always been well please with anything that we
have ever obtained from The de Laurence Co.
Further, I wish to inform you how I have been helped to play a guitar. No living being
has ever taught me. I simply wrote a Message on my Scroll, requesting the Spirits to help
me play my guitar. Suddenly, the next morning, after operating my Scroll, as I was laying
in bed, a feeling came to me as though I had all at once become possessed of the ability to
play a guitar. I got right up out of bed and tried to tune it. To my surprise, in a very short
time, I succeeded in putting it in perfect tune, and from that time on everybody has been
surprised at the way I am able to play my guitar. Even professional guitar players are
puzzled and do not understand how I can play the guitar as well as I do, without having
received any instruction. However, as stated above, 1 all at once seemed to develop wonder­
ful ability as a guitar player.
Again, I have tested my Scroll in several different ways, that is, in giving treatments, influencing people, and
have also been able to use it in regard to my success in business. I soon expect to travel in South America, and shall
certainly be sure to take my Scroll and Accessories with me. It is very pleasing to know that I can obtain more
Incense and Candles direct from you at any time.
In closing, all I can say is that I thank you very much, and feel that de LAURENCE’S SPIRIT SCROLL
has been the means of giving me wondeful Wisdom and a deeper sight into Spiritualism and Occultism than I
ever thought I would be able to obtain.
I assure you that I am more than pleased with my Scroll. I ordered SET ONE, and my friends will hardly
believe that the Scroll was sent to me Absolutely Free. Sincerely yours,
Jas. F. Graham, Ralph and Dean Sts», Brooklyn, N. Y.

The Burning Of Waxen Candles With The Declaration Scroll
The Continuity Of Life After Death. The Burning- of Candles is an old custom which
has been followed religiously for ages. Again, the Burning of Candles and Incense seems
to stimulate the belief in Spiritual communication. The Burning of Candles also offers
an appropriate and striking way of showing one’s faith in a continued life beyond the
grave. Many burn Candles to manifest in an outward way, the devotion and faith they
have in the Spiritual World. Therefore, the burning of Candles is mute but striking evi­
dence of one’s faith in the continuity of life after death.
Life Here But A Temporary Abode. There seems to be something about the Burning
Of A Candle which impresses upon us the great, over-powering fact that our life and
intelligence continues after we have finished up our earthly career. These are great
truths, all flowing from the ages and philosophies of the past. The Burning of Candles
by a Spiritualist, or an Occultist, may be accepted as a sign of their faith in the exis­
tence of another life. A Candle burned now and then is impressive testimony; an exhibi­
tion of faith and belief on their part that life here is but a temporary abode that is
touched by the fingers of light for a short time only; while all around yawns an infinite,
shoreless gulf of impenetrable darkness, from one side of which we appeared and to whose
other side we shall hurry at death to meet our loved ones and friends living in the
Spiritual World.
NOTE. The Burning Of Candles, especially if they are of certain given colors, is mani­
fest and tangible evidence of your faith in Spiritualism and is believed, to be one of the
best means to attract and bring about the Invocation of those who inhabit the Spiritual
World. In view of this fact we are, after a great deal of trouble and expense, pleased
to announce that we can furnish with the Declaration Scroll, Candles in Four different
colors. The colors furnished are as follows: Blue, Snow White, Dead-Black and Oriental
Yellow. All of these Candles are described above.

Importers Of Temple Incense. The importers of Temple Incense make the following
statement regarding it: “There are few things so characteristic of the fascination and
mystery of the beauty loving lands beyond the Pacific, as Temple Incense. Its dreamy,
soothing fragrance brings to mind the rosy dawns, the brilliant sunlight, the purple dusks
of the Orient—the enchantments of strange, Far Eastern countries—the subtle, languorous
sweetness of tropical gardens and of blossom-laden breezes blown from palm-fringed islands
set in Turquoise Seas. Temple Incense is made according to a formula adopted from one
that for centuries has played an important part in the Ceremonial Rites of the Orient. Its
principal ingredients, Sandalwood and Patachouly, were among the first to be used by
those learned Arabian chemists, to whom the world is indebted for its finest perfumes.
A very fine Golden-Brown Powder is the form in which Incense has always been used in the
Orient and the Far East.

The Burning Of Waxen Candles With The Declaration Scroll
The Continuity Of Life After Death. The Burning of Candles is an old custom which
has been followed religiously for ages. Again, the Burning of Candles and Incense seems
to stimulate the belief in Spiritual communication. The Burning of Candles also offer,
an appropriate and striking way of showing one’s faith in a continued life beyond the
grave. Many burn Candles to manifest in an outward way, the devotion and faith they
have in the Spiritual World. Therefore, the burning of Candles is mute but striking evi­
dence of one’s faith in the continuity of life after death.
Life Here But A Temporary Abode. There seems to be something about the Burning
Of A Candle which impresses upon us the great, over-powering fact that our life and
intelligence continues after we have finished up our earthly career. These are great
truths, all flowing from the ages and philosophies of the past. The Burning of Candles
by a Spiritualist, or an Occultist, may be accepted as a sign of their faith in the exis­
tence of another life. A Candle burned now and then is impressive testimony; an exhibi­
tion of faith and belief on their part that life here is but a temporary abode that is
touched by the fingers of light for a short time only; while all around yawns an infinite,
shoreless gulf of impenetrable darkness, from one side of which we appeared and to whose
other side we shall hurry at death to meet our loved ones and friends living in the
Spiritual World.
XOTE. The Burning Of Candles, especially if they are of certain given colors, is mani­
fest and tangible evidence of your faith in Spiritualism and is believed to be one of the
best means to attract and bring about the Invocation of those who inhabit the Spiritual
World. In view of this fact we are, after a great deal of trouble and expense, pleased
to announce that we can furnish with the Declaration Scroll, Candles in Four different
colors. The colors furnished are as follows: Blue, Snow White, Dead-Black and Oriental
Yellow. All of these Candles are described above.

luminous perpetual light when hung in your sleeping room where is can be seen seems to
promote sound sleep especially if one is nervous or restless.

quate equipment for the most sincere persons, at a remarkably reasonable price.

The Meaning and Power of Perfume
Those who have studied the mystical and occult sciences will have read the Master’s
instructions and recommendations concerning- the proper use of perfumes, incenses and
scents. It was held by the Venerable Magi and is asserted by modern Adepts, that it is per­
missible to use outside agencies to assist the induction of the proper mental state for the
pursuit of mystical and occult studies. One of the most potent of these outside aids is
perfume.
de LAURENCE’S OCCULT SCIENCE STUDENTS’ DEVELOPMENT SET brings the Ini­
tiate necessary equipment in the form of TRANSCENDENTAL SPRINKLING PERFUME
with which the atmosphere of a room may be saturated and modified until it coincides
with the spiritual requirements of the Student. The BLUE SPRINKLING ATOMIZER
effectively diffuses the perfume in the surrounding- air, or may be used to anoint the
vestments. The SPECIAL BLUE HANDKERCHIEF, properly treated with TRANSCEN­
DENTAL SPRINKLING PERFUME and carried in the pocket, assists the Student in calling
up the proper mental associations and inducing- the proper mental state in any place and
at any time.
IRRESISTIBLE CHARM AND LASTING ODOR
are found in TRANSCENDENTAL SPRINKLING PERFUME. It is a fragrant scent with
oriental and tropical characteristics and will satisfy any desire for a luxurious and volup­
tuous aroma for women of taste and discernment. Delicate and subtle enoug-h for -the most
effete, TRANSCENDENTAL SPRINKLING PERFUME has yet a well fixed odor, and a few
drops on a handkerchief can be perceived days after application.
The Kavacha Talisman
Too well known to require description, the famous Kavacha Talisman is included in
this Set without charge, complete with gold chain with which to wear the talisman about
the neck. Concerning this talisman a Sanskrit Solka says: “It is the Great Giver of Wealth
and Good Graces. It Destroys all Dangers and Difficulties, Eradicates All Sorts of Poisons,
and Bestows Victory at All Times.” We know that all those interested will 13e pleased to

EPISTLE TO THE DISCIPLE.
BY de LAURENCE.
“Thou, O, Disciple! whose mind is high,
‘ * Observe my words, and read them with thine eye (spiritual);
“These Magic secrets in thy sacred breast repone,
“And in thy journey think of God alone;
“The Author of all things, that cannot die;
“Of whom I now shall speak----- ’’
I tell thee here, Disciple, to observe my words, and read them with thine eye,
that is, the eye of thine understanding; for, know, there are many that hear me speak,
and, pretend to study my writings, that read not the meaning of my words.
Wherefore shouldst thou contemplate these mysteries, of which, the good books
on the subject of Magic’, listed in this Great Catalogue teach, with so much constancy
of mind, if thou didst not perceive in these works some great good most desirable?—
Listen, then, O, young man, or, young woman, and hear my words! Study my works;
for they will show thee the dangerous precipice of vanity and head-long desire—The
teachings, contained in my books will describe to thee the stubborn and fatal will of
thy passions, even with tears of contrition, and heartfelt compassion for thy experience—
1 will lead thee, as it were, by the hand, through those labyrinths of vice, wherewith
thou art daily surrounded; and, however prejudiced thou mightest be against the receiving
of my doctrine, yet, be assured, these teachings have in their possession the Magical
virtue and power of binding thee to the principles taught therein, and making thee happy,
in spite of thyself.
Here is a great secret! thou shalt say—every man and woman wishes to be happy—
which I grant; but my answer is—most people. prevent their own happiness; they
destroy it, by suffering themselves to be governed by the outward principle of the
flesh, thinking the greatest good to be in the satisfying of their carnal appetites, or
in the amassing together heaps of -wealth, whereby they thrust down the meek and
poor, raising up the standards of Pride, Envy, and Oppression. These things every
day’s experience confirms; nay, there are some so blind, that, in the possession of much
wealth, they think there is nothing beyond it; insomuch, that they triumph in lust,
oppression, revenge, and contumely. But how is it, thou wilt say, that, seeing man is
a reasonable being, he can possibly give up his government so easily?—I say, when man
suffers the unreasonable and bestial part to deprave him, then he immediately becomes
a slave, (and the vilest of slavery is that which deprives man of his social virtues;) for
then, although in the possession of great worldly things, such as houses, estates, and all
other temporal gifts, yet he becomes an immediate instrument to the Evil Astral Spirits
and the Powers of Darkness, seeing that those riches he inherits are merely given him
in this life, to bestow upon others those necessaries and comforts wdiieh he himself
does not feel the want of, and by which he might, if not blinded by his passions and
lusts, secure himself an eternal and incorruptible treasure. But he who possesses
treasures without mercy, liberality, bounty, charity, &c., robs the Eternal Author of
all good, of the honor due unto him, and, is working destruction to his own soul; his
riches, instead of benefiting himself and others, eventually and finally terminate as a
curse; while he lives here he is a scourge to society; and, after he leaves this, it is
plain enough pointed out in my writings what will be his situation and condition.
Therefore, thou young man, or, young woman, that hast but a few years to live,
study how to attain the stone I teach of; it will protract the beauty of thy youth,
though thou shouldst live for centuries—it will ever supply thee with the means of
comforting the afflicted; insomuch, that when thou hast attained this truly desirable
and most perfect talisman, thy life become soft and pleasant; no cares, nor corroding
pangs—no self-torment will ever invade thy mind; neither shalt thou want the means to
be happy, in respect of the possession of the goods of this life but thou shalt have abun­
dantly. But how and from what source, all this is to proceed—out of what thing
or matter thou shalt attain thy wished-for end—the studying of Sacred Magic will
sufficiently shew.

c»V>1l ANP SPIRITUAL BOOKS f
JESUS, THE NAZARENE REFORMER
BY L. W. de LAURENCE.
“Give ye not that which is sacred to the dogs,
Neither cast ye your pearls before swine;
For the swine will tread them under their feet
And the dogs will turn and rend you.”
(Extract from The Sermon on the Mount.)
FTER nineteen centuries of enforced eliminations from the canonical*
books, of the Bible, of every sentence which might put the investigator
on the true path, it has become very difficult to show, to the satis­
faction of exact science, that the "Pagan’’ worshippers of Adonis,
their neighbors, the Nazarenes, and the Pythagorean Essence, the
healing Therapeutes, the Ebionites, and other sects were all, with
very slight differences, followers of the ancient Theurgic Mysteries.
And yet by analogy and a close study of the hidden sense of their
rites and customs, we can trace their kinship.
It was given to a contemporary of Jesus to become the means of pointing out to pos­
terity, by his interpretation of the oldest literature of Israel, how deeply the kabalistic
philosophy agreed in its esoterism with that of the profoundest Greek thinkers. This
contemporary, and ardent disciple of Plato and Aristotle, was Philo Judaeus. While
explaining the Mosaic books according to a purely kabalistic method, he is the famous
Hebrew writer whom Kingsley calls the Father of New Platonism.
It is evident that Philo Judaeus’ Therapeutes are a branch of the Essenes.)
Their name indicates it—Asaya, Physician. Hence, the contradictions, forgeries, and
other desperate expedience to reconcile the prophecies of the Jewish canon with the
Galilean nativity and godship.
Luke, who was a physician, is designated in the Syriac texts as Asaia, the Essaian or
Essene. Josephus and Philo Judaeus have sufficiently described this sect to leave no doubt
in my mind that Jesus, the Nazarene Reformer, after having received his education in
their dwellings in the desert, and been duly initiated in the Mysteries, preferred the free
and independent life of a wandering Nazaria, and so separated or inazarenized himself
from them, thus becoming a traveling Therapeute, a Nazaria, a healer. Every Therapeute,
before quitting his community, had to do the same. Both Jesus and St. John the Baptist
preached the end of the age; if. which proves their knowledge of the secret computation of
the priests and kabalists, who with the chiefs of the Essene communities alone had the
secret of the duration of the cycles. The latter were kabalists and theurgists; “they
had their mystic books, and predicted future events.”
Dunlap, whose personal researches seem to have been quite successful in that direc­
tion, traces the Essenes, Nazarenes, Dositheans, and some other sects as having all existed
before Christ: “They rejected pleasures, despised riches, loved one another, and more
than other sects, neglected wedlock, deeming the conquest of the passions to be virtuous.”
These are all virtues preached by Jesus; and if we are to take the gospels as a stand­
ard of truth, Christ was a metempsychosist, _ “or re-incarnationist”—again like these same
Essenes, whom we see were Pythagoreans in all their doctrines and habits. lamblichus
asserts that the Samian philosopher spent a certain time at Carmel with them.||
In his discourses and sermons, Jesus always spoke in parables and used metaphors
with his audience. This habit was again that of the Essenians and the Nazarenes; the
Galileans who dwelt in cities and villages were never known to use such allegorical
language. Indeed, some of his disciples being Galileans as well as himself, felt even
surprised to find him using with the people such a form of expression. "Why speakest
thou unto them in parables?”** they often inquired.
* Canonical books or Scriptures, those writings or books of the Bible accepted by the Church as
genuine and inspired. The Roman Catholic Church receives as canonical some of the books styled
Apocryphal by other Churches.
t Es-sene, e-sen, n. One of an ascetic party or sect of the Jews, formed about the 2d century
before the Christian era, and existing till the fall of Jerusalem. They practiced voluntary poverty,
had community of goods, sought higher degrees of holiness, and were mostly celibates. Josephus
(“Antiquities” xiii) speaks of the Essenes as a sect which had existed in the time of the Maccabees.
K. Kohler in Jew. Encyc., Vol. V, p. 228 (F. W. Co. 1903).
t The real meaning of the division into ages is esoteric and Buddhistic. So little did the un­
initiated Christians understand it that they accepted the words of Jesus literally and firmly believed
that he meant the end of the world. There had been many prophecies about the forthcoming age.
Virgil, in the fourth Eclogue, mentions the Metatron—a new offspring, with whom the iron age shall
end and a golden one arise.
|| “Vit. Pytliag.” Munk derives the name of the lessaens or Essenes from the Syriac Asaya—
the healers, or physicians, thus showing their identity with the Egyptian Therapeutae. “Palestine,”

“Because, it is given unto you to know the Mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but
to them it is not given,” was the reply, which was that of an initiate. “Therefore, I speak
unto them in parables; because, they seeing, see not, and hearing, they hear not, neither
do they understand.” Moreover, we find Jesus expressing his thoughts still clearer—and
in sentences which are purely Pythagorean—when, during the Sermon on the Mount,
he says:
“Give ye not that which is sacred to .the dogs,
Neither cast ye your pearls before swine;
For the swine will tread them under their feet
And the dogs will turn and rend you.”
Professor A. Wilder, the editor of Taylor’s Eleusinign. Mysteries, observes “a like
disposition on the part of Jesus and Paul to classify their doctrines as esoteric and
exoteric, the Mysteries of the Kingdom of God ‘for the apostles,’ and ‘parables’ for the
multitude. 'We speak wisdom,’ says Paul, ‘among them that are perfect’ (or initiated).”
In the Eleusinian and other Mysteries the participants were always divided into two
classes, the neophytes and the perfect. The former were sometimes admitted to the pre­
liminary initiation: the dramatic performance of Ceres, or the soul, descending to Hades.
*
But it was given only to the “perfect” to enjoy and learn the Mysteries of the divine
Elysium, the celestial abode of the blessed: this Elysium being unquestionably the same
as the “Kingdom of Heaven.” To contradict or reject the above, would be merely to shut
one’s eyes to the truth.
* This descent to Hades signified the inevitable fate of each soul to be united for a time with a
terrestrial body. This union, or dark-prospect for the soul to find itself imprisoned within the dark
tenement of a body, was considered by all the ancient philosophers and is even by the modern
Buddhists, as a punishment.
t “The profound or esoteric doctrines of the ancients were denominated wisdom, and afterward
philosophy, and also the Gnosis, or knowledge. They related to the human soul, its divine parentage,
its supposed degradation from its high estate by becoming connected with “generation” or the
physical world, its onward progress and restoration to God by regeneration or . . . transmi­
grations.” Ibid, p. 2, footnote.
f Cyril of Jerusalem asserts it. See vi. 10.
The narrative of the Apostle Patil, in his second Epistle to the Corinthians (xii. 3,
4), has struck several scholars," well versed in the descriptions of the mystical rites of
the initiation given by some classics, as alluding most undoubtedly to the final Epopteia.
“I knew a certain man—whether in body or outside of body. I know not: God
knoweth—who was rapt into Paradise, and heard things ineffable which it is not lawful
for a man to repeat.” These words have rarely, so far as I know, been regarded by
commentators as an allusion to the beautific visions of an “initiated” seer. But the
phraseology is unequivocal. These things “which it is not lawful to repeat,” are hinted at
in the same words, and the reason for it assigned, is the same as that which we find
repeatedly expressed by Plato, Proclus, lamblichus, Herodotus, and other classics. “We
speak wisdom only among them who are perfect,” says Paul; the plain and undeniable
translation of the sentence being: “We speak of the profound (or final) esoteric doc­
trines of the Mysteries (which were denominated wisdom) only among them who are
initiated.”! So in relation to the “man who was rapt into Paradise”—and who was
evidently Paul himselft—the Christian word Paradise having replaced that of Elysium.
To complete the proof, I might recall the words of Plato, which show that before an
initiate could see the gods in their purest light, he had to become liberated from his
material body; i. e., to separate his astral body from it. Apuleius also describes his initia­
tion into the Mysteries in the same way:
“Z approached the confines of death; and, having trodden on the threshold of Proser­
pina, returned, having been carried through all the elements. In the depths of midnight
I saw the sun glittering with a splendid light, together with the infernal and supernal gods,
and to these divinities approaching, I paid the tribute of devout adoration.”
Thus, in common with Pythagoras and other hierophant reformers, Jesus divided his
teachings into exoteric and esoteric. Following faithfully the Pythagoreo-Essenean ways,
he never sat at a meal without saying “grace.” “The priest prays before his meal,” says
Josephus describing the Essenes. Jesus also divided his followers into “neophytes,”
''brethren," and the “perfect,” if we may judge from the difference he made between
them. But his career at least as a public Rabbi, was of too short duration to allow him
to establish a regular school of his own; and with the exception, perhaps, of John, it does
not seem that he had initiated any other apostle. The Gnostic amulets and talismans are
mostly the emblems of the apocalyptic allegories. The “seven vowels” are closely related
to the “seven seals”; and the mystic title Abraxas, partakes as much of the composition of
Shem Hamphirosh, “the holy word.” or ineffable name, as the name called: The word of
God, that, “no man knew but he himself,” as John expresses it.

which was no portrait, but the figure of a man with a jackal-head, like Anubis. On this
gem, as seen in the collection of Gnostic amulets, the Good Shepherd bears upon his
shoulders the lost lamb. He seems to have a human head upon his neck; but, as King
correctly observes, “it only seems so to the uninitiated eye.” On closer inspection, he
becomes the double-headed Anubis, having one head human, the other a jackal’s, whilst his
girdle assumes the form of a serpent rearing aloft its crested head. “This figure,” adds
the author of the Gnostics, etc., “had two meanings—one obvious for the vulgar; the other
mystical, and recognizable by the initiated alone. It was perhaps the signet of some chief
teacher or apostle. This affords a fresh proof that the Gnostics and early orthodox (?)
Christians were not so wide apart in their secret doctrine. King deduces from a quotation
from Epiphanius, that even as late as 400 A. D. it was considered an atrocious sin to
attempt to represent the bodily appearance of Christ. Epiphanius brings it as an idolatrous
charge against the Carpocratians that “they kept painted portraits, and even gold and silver
images, and in other materials, which they pretended to be portraits of Jesus, and made by
Pilate after the likeness of Christ. . . . These they keep in secret, along with Pythago­
ras, Plato and Aristotle, and setting them all up together, they worship and offer sacrifices
unto them after the Gentiles’ fashion."
What would the pious Epiphanius say were he to resuscitate and step into St. Peter’.-
Cathedral at Rome! Ambrosius seems also very desperate at the idea—that some persons’
fully credited that statement of Lampridius that Alexander Severus had in his private chapel
an image of Christ among other great philosophers. “That the Pagans should have pre­
served the likeness of Christ," he exclaims, “but the disciples have neglected to do so, is
a notion the mind siiudders to entertain, much less to believe.”
All this points undeniably to the fact, that except a handful of self-styled Christians
who subsequently won the day, all the civilized portion of the Pagans who knew of Jesus
honored him as a philosopher, and Adept whom they placed on the same level with
Pythagoras and Apollonius. Whence such a veneration on their part for a man, were he
simply, as represented by the Synoj.lics, a poor, unknown Jewish carpenter from Nazareth?
As an incarnated God there is no single record of Jesus, on this earth, capable of with­
standing the critical examination of science; as one of the greatest reformers, and inveterate
enemy of every theological dogmatism, a persecutor of bigotry, a teacher of one of the most
sublime codes of ethics, Jesus is one of the grandest and most clearly-defined figures on
the panorama of h.tman history. His age may, with every day, be receding farther and
farther back into the gloomy and hazy mists of the past; and his theology—based on
human fancy and supported by untenable dogmas—may, nay, must zvith every day lose
more of its unmerited prestige; alone the grand figure of the philosopher and moral
reformer instead of growing paler will become ztrith every century more pronounced and
more clearly defined. It zvill reign supreme and universal only on that day when the zvhole
of humanity recognizes but one father—the unknown one above—and one brother—
the zvhole of mankind below.*
In a pretended letter of Lentulus, a senator and a distinguished historian to the Roman
senate, there is a description of the personal appearance of Jesus. The letter itself,
written in horrid Latin is pronounced a bare-faced forgery; but I have found therein
an expression which suggests many thoughts. Albeit a forgery it is evident that whoso­
ever invented it has nevertheless tried to follow tradition as closely as possible. The
hair of Jesus is represented in it as “wavy and curling . . flowing down upon his
shoulders,” and as “having a parting in the middle of the head after the fashion of the
Nazarenes.” This last sentence shows: First. That there was such a tradition, based
on the biblical description of John the Baptist, the Nazaria, and the custom of this sect.
Second. Had Lentulus been the author of this letter, it is difficult to believe that Paul
should never have heard of it; and had he known its contents, he would never have pro­
nounced it a shame for men to wear their hair long.i thus shaming his Lord and Christ-
God. Third. If Jesus did wear his hair long and parted in the middle of the forehead,
after the fashion of the Nazarenes (as well as John, the only one of his apostles who
followed it), then I have one good reason more to say that Jesus must have belonged to
the sect of the Nazarenes, and been called Nasaria. for this reason and not because he
was an inhabitant of Nazareth; for they never wore their hair long. The Nazarite, who
separated himself unto the Lord, allowed “no razor to come upon his head.” “He shall
be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair on his head grow,” says Numbers (vi. 5).
Samson was a Nazarite, i. e., vowed to the service of God, and in his hair was his strength.
“No razor shall come upon his head; the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the
womb” (Judges, xiii., 5). But the final and most reasonable conclusion to be inferred
from this is that Jesus, who was so opposed to all the orthodox Jewish practices, would

not have allowed his hair to grow had he not belonged to this sect, which in the days
of John the Baptist had already become a heresy in the eyes of the Sanhedrim. The
Talmud, speaking of the Nazaria, or the Nazarenes (who had abandoned the world like
Hindu Yogis or Adepts') calls them a sect of physicians, of wandering exorcists; as also
does Jervis. “They went about the country, living on alms and performing cures.”*
Epiphanius says that the Nazarenes come next in heresy to the Corinthians whether
having existed “before them or after them, nevertheless synchronous,” and then adds
that “all Christians at that time were equally called Nazarenes!’A
* See the “Israelite Indeed,” vol. ii, p. 348; “Treatise Naeir.” •
t “Epiph, e<l Petar," vol, 1, p. 117.
In the very first remark made by Jesus about John the Baptist, we find him stating
that he is “Elias, which was for to come.” This assertion, if it is not a later interpolation
for the sake of having a prophecy fulfilled, means again that Jesus was a kabalist; unless
indeed we have to adopt the doctrine of the Trench spiritists and suspect him of believing
in reincarnation. Except the kabalistic sects of the Essenes, the Nazarenes, the disciples
of Simeon Ben lochai, and Hillel. Neither the orthodox Jews, nor the Galileans, believed
or knew anything about the doctrine of permutation. And the Sadducees rejected even
that of the resurrection.
THE MYTHOLOGY OF EGYPT
Christian Doctrines That Have No Place In The New Testament
The study of error is often only a little less important than the study of truth. The
history of the human mind in its progress from ignorance towards knowledge should
tell us the mistakes into which it has sometimes wandered, as well as its steps in the
right path. We turn, indeed, with more pleasure to review the sources from which the
world has gained any of its valuable truths, in the hope of there finding some further
knowledge which may be equally valuable; while for our errors, so long as we are unwill­
ing to acknowledge them to be errors, we too often shut our eyes, and refuse to be
shown their origin.
The Emperor Marcus Antoninus, in his philosophical work, mentions the several
tutors, and friends from whom he gained his good habits, and those views of life which
he chiefly valued; but though we must suppose that he was aware of some failings in
his character, he does not tell us to which of his companions he owed them. And so it
is with the benefits of civilization, arts, and religion; and also with the evils of super­
stition. Modern Europe readily acknowledges how many benefits it received from Rome,
from Greece, and from Judea, but has been willing to forget how much of its superstition
came from Egypt.
When Christians shall at length acknowledge that many of those doctrines, which
together now make up orthodoxy, or the religion of the majority, as distinguished from
the simple religion which Jesus taught and practised; when they shall acknowledge that
many of them are so many sad and lamentable errors; then, and not till then, will they
seek to know their origin, and enquire from which of the several branches of Paganism
they sprung. They will then see that most of the so-called Christian doctrines, that have
no place in the New Testament, reached Europe from Egypt, through Alexandria.
All nations borrow from others—at least, from those who are before them in the
race of civilization. They borrow from each of their neighbors in those branches of
knowledge in, which they think they can do so wisely, and what they have taken often
shows itself in the language. This can be best explained by instances from our own
language. Thus, when we speak about the army, our words show that the French were
our instructors in military matters, and we talk of “aide-de-camp,” “chevaux de frise,”
“captain,” “lieutenant,” “ensign,” “cadet.”
When we speak of the church we use Latin words, as “vestry,” “rector,” “citrate,” “in­
cumbent,” "ordination,” “font,” “creed,” “doctrine.”
Words more strictly religious are often Greek, as “baptism,” “liturgy,” “litany.”
The Italians gave us our words belonging to bookkeeping and banking, as “debtor,”
“creditor,” “cambist,” “ditto,” “bankrupt," “usance.”
The Spanish have given us a few words relating to their social life, such as “alcove,"
"verandah,” “duenna.”
From the Arabs, through scientific treatises, we have taken “almanach,” "alchemy,”
“chemistry,” “algebra."
The Italians also have given us many words relating to art, such as “mezzotint,” “fresco­
painting," "chiaroscuro,” “pianoforte,” “violoncello," “opera.”
rbese few instances are, perhaps, enough to justify us in thinking that when the

MAT RENCl COMPANY, Qiicago.iu.iisA.
■' AND SPIRITUAL BOOKS —■=—
Greeks, Romans, and Jews have made use of Coptic* words, it has arisen from their
having borrowed these branches of knowledge from the Egyptians.
The aim of the following pages is not only to explain the Mythology of Egypt, but
to show the extraordinary readiness with which its religious opinions were copied by the
neighboring nations, particularly by the Greeks and Romans. In matters of religion, the
more ignorant part of those two nations bowed in reverence to the greater earnestness
and seriousness of the Egyptians, who were at the same time so remarkably rich in
mythological invention. Pagan Greece received from Egypt all that part of its religion
which related to a future state of rewards and punishments, and though Christian Greece
was for a short time too intelligent to take the whole of the Egyptian mysticism and
superstition, yet Christian Rome, from which my own opinions were chiefly learned, had
no such hesitation, and was at all times a most willing pupil.
These facts may receive some explanation from two known laws of the human mind.
First, among religious persons the fear of doing wrong makes them more afraid of fall­
ing into scepticism than into credulity; and those who believe more, whether they believe
wisely or unwisely, are apt to think themselves on safer ground than those who believe
less. In the case of a proposition in science, when the arguments for it and against it
seem cqpal, the reasoner withholds his assent; but in the case of a religious dogma or
article of faith, the mind in its weakness fancies it safer to accept it than to reject it.
The reasoning powers are in part overruled by the feelings. In religious controversy, both
parties, the believer, and the doubter, usually feel that the reproach of disbelief, which
it is in the power of one to throw against the other, hits a much harder blow than the
reproach of credulity and superstition, which is all that the other can fling back again.
It is only among irreligious persons and scoffers that the feelings strengthen the other
side, and that disbelief can shut the door against argument by an equally blind and unfair
claim to superiority. Hence arises the power which superstitious and complicated systems
of religion have of spreading themselves, and hence the weakness of good sense when
setting up its simple truths against the encroachments of many-sided errors.
Secondly, earnestness and sincerity are the most powerful helps by which we enforce
our opinions and convert our neighbors. And there was far more real conviction of the
truth of their religion among the Egyptians than among their Greek and Roman neighboys.
Hence the opinions of the more ignorant lived and spread, while the opinions held with
hollowness and insincerity by the more enlightened died away.
The following are the principal doctrines which are most certainly kfiown to be
common to Egyptian Mythology and modern orthodoxy, as distinguished from the religion
of Jesus. They include the Trinity, the two natures of Christ, and the atonement by
vicarious s'ufferings.
First. That the creation and government of the world is not the work of one simple
and undivided Being, but of one God, made up of several persons. This is the doctrine
of Plurality in Unity.
Second. That happiness, or the favor of the Judge of the living and the dead, could
scarcely be hoped for, either from his justice or his mercy, unless an atoning sacrifice had
been paid to him on man’s behalf, by a divine being; and that mankind, or some part of
them, may hope to have their sins forgiven because of the merits and intercession of
that being, and to be excused from punishment because he consented to be sacrificed for
them. With the Egyptians there were four such chief mediators.
Third. That among the gods, or persons which compose the godhead, one, though a
god, could yet suffer pain and be put to death.
Fourth. That a god, a man, or being half god and half man, once lived upon earth,
who had been born of an earthly mother, but without an earthly father.
It may amuse, while it will help my argument, to mention also a few of the less
important Egyptian opinions which are still common among learned men. Trifles some­
times declare their origin more certainly than opinions and habits of greater importance,
which may be thought common to the human mind. Among the most interesting is the
wedding ring. The Egyptian gold, before the introduction of coinage, had been usually
kept in the form of a ring; and the Egyptian at his marriage placed one of these pieces
of gold on his wife’s finger in token of his entrusting her with all his property. The
early Christians, says Clemens, saw no harm in following this custom; and in the marriage
ceremony, of today, the man places the same plain ring of gold on his bride’s finger when
he says, “With all my worldly goods I thee endow.”

pbysitical. From being a large and powerful church, it has dwindled to one with but 15 bishops,
much weakened by persecution and subjection to Moslem rule.

It was one of the duties of the priests of Philo? Ito purchase of the River Nile a
bountiful overflow by throwing a piece of gold into the stream once a year, and hence,
probably the Venetians borrowed their custom of wedding the Adriatic by throwing a
gold ring into the sea. At the same time the Doge’s cap was copied from the crown of
Lower Egypt.
The Christmas game of drawing lots, for the title of King and Queen, is Egyptian.
It was called, by the Alexandrians, as Julius Pollux tells us, the game of Basilinda; and
Tacitus mentions the quarrel between Nero and Britannicus when they were playing at
this game in Rome.
The Egyptian day of eating sugared cakes had been our twentieth of January, but in
the fourth century, says Moses of Chorene, it was changed to be kept fourteen days earlier;
and the sugared cake of the Egyptians now marks the feast of Epiphany, or Twelfth
Night.
When the Roman Catholic priest shaves the crown of his head, it is because the
Egyptian priest had done the same before.
When the English clergyman, though, he preaches his sermon in a silk or woollen robe,
may read the liturgy in no dress but linen, it is because linen was the clothing of the
Egyptians. Two thousand years before the bishop of Rome pretended to hold the keys
of heaven and earth, there was an Egyptian priest with the high-sounding title of Appointed
keeper of the two doors of heaven, in the city of Thebes.
Christian art also owes much to the Egyptian imagination. The Virgin Mary rising
to heaven, standing upon a crescent moon, very closely resembles Isis as the dog star
rising heliacally. The figure of the Almighty, with head and outstretched arms at the
head of the picture, particularly in the early pictures, when the head hung downwards,
is the same in design as that of. Horus at the top of many a funeral pyre. The figure
of a triangle to represent the Trinity was clearly borrowed from Pagan Egypt.
The supposed arts of astrology and witchcraft were more particularly Egyptian; the
conjuror’s word of Abracadabra, is a corruption of the Greek word Abrasax, which is
itself a corruption of the Egyptian hurt me not, by which they hoped to warn off evil
spirits; and fortune-tellers are even yet called Egyptians or Gypsies. When Shakespear
brings upon the stage the queen of the witches, who bears the name of Hecate, one of
the well-known names of Isis.
These fanciful customs and foolish opinions and traditions of art help to show that
although the old Egyptian race has ceased to be a nation for more than twelve hundred
years, during which its history has been neglected, and its .very existence often forgotten,
yet the Egyptian mind still has a most important influence upon our modern civilization.
Protestant Europe is even now struggling to throw off the graver errors of the Nicene
Creed and the Atonement, which Rome received from Egypt fifteen centuries ago.
THE HISTORY OF RELIGIOUS ERROR
The history of religious error is the history of the mind wandering in its search after
Truth. We meet among the gross idolatry of one nation, as in the purer religion of an­
other nation, the same acknowledgment that man is not his own creator, and that he is
dependent for his welfare upon the will of some being or beings more powerful than
himself.
The cultivated man, when studying the wonders of the creation around him, traces
them back through numerous secondary causes to one great First Cause, and thus arrives
at the belief in One Undivided God; and feels more sure of the truth of his reasoning in
proportion to the simplicity to which it leads him. On the other hand, an observing but
unphilosophical man, in the childhood of the world when he had noted the various secondary
causes which produce all the effects which meet his senses, would perhaps look no further;
and he thus arrived at the belief in a variety of gods. But this is not always the case.
Some nations seem, like the modern Turks, to have arrived at a Telief in one God, as if
from indolence of mind, from blind fatalism, from mere want of observation of the numer­
ous causes which are working around them.
Thus many of the Arabic races in the neighborhood of Egypt, as well as the Israelites,
traced the hand of one only God, or Great First Cause, in all they enjoyed and all they
suffered. But the Egyptians,. like the Greeks and Romans, seeing so many causes at
work, and not perceiving that they might all be set in motion by One First Cause, thought
that every blessing that they received, and every misfortune that befell them, was the
work of a different god. They thus peopled the seen and the unseen world beyond with
a variety of beings or powers. To these they returned thanks for the blessings that they
enjoyed, or more often, as led by a melancholy and less grateful disposition, addressed
entreaties that they would withhold their injuries and punishments. The sculptured monu­
ments of the country teach ns the figures and sometimes the characters of these imaginary
beings, together with the cities and parts of the kingdom in which each was more par­
ticularly worshiped,

The Genesis Of The Hindu Adepts, Yoghees
And Master Lamas Of Central And Northern India
Written Down By L. W. de LAURENCE, Author And Publisher
In speaking of the teachings of East Indian Occultism, Spiritual Communications, Soul Transi­
tion and Soul Reincarnation, one cannot be too' profound in his statement that the Hindus have the
true and Sacred Wisdom, and among a subtle race like the Hindus, which is immeasurably older in
civilization and experience than either Americans or Europeans, Occult Forces and Spiritual Laws
have been discovered thousands, of years ago and preserved among the wisest of their represen­
tatives, who in consequence of this knowledge can perform feats which to the Western man’s
limited understanding are perfectly miraculous. The performances of the Hindu Adepts, which
are a surprise and a revelation to the traveler from the West, have excited the wonder of all ages.
The powers of these Spiritual Magicians, who dwell in the fastness of Northern India, have been,
subject to investigation ever since the Western man began to penetrate into that ancient land of
the Orient. The Occult feats performed by the Adepts and Yoghees are not the result of
trickery, ledgerdemain or sleight of hand. Trees twenty and thirty feet in height are made to
grow and spring up in a moment from a seed. A rope or cord is thrown into the air without any
means of support, and on this rope the Hindu climbs towards the clouds out of your sight. Hissing
and wiggling snakes are developed with a Magical pass of the hand over a bucket of clear water,
and rooms which were dark are suddenly brightly illuminated without, any apparent source of
light. Heavy bodies are suspended in the air without the slightest means of support. After being
placed in the state of Death Trance, live men are buried many feet in the earth apparently lifeless,
and after a lapse of days or weeks are exhumed and resurrected before the very eyes of the
gaping multitude. Several persons are apparently fused into one single individual, and again this
one person becomes several before your amazed and startled eyes. The Hindu Adepts are a
class of men that eat little and want little; they spend their time in contemplation and deep* medi­
tation, scorning the Western civilization as ignorant, material and base.
The Western scientist has come to the conclusion that Mind and Body are only one form of
matter. The Hindu Adept will tell you, that matter is not a form of mind. He will spurn all of
the material possessions and pleasures, for which the Western man has spent all the energy of his
life, as so much bauble and trash. The Spirit and Soul is everything to him: the physical body
and their desires are nothing. It is to be very much doubted that there is one person in a thousand
among those who use the word “Mahatma” that understands the true meaning of this term, although
they use it very freely and flippantly wtihout the slightest idea as to its true meaning. Many think
it means a Hindu Faikree of some caste. A Mahatma of India is one who has purified his
“Mahatma” or Spiritual Soul, so that his higher ego is able to act directly upon his material body.
When this has been accomplished, he becomes a Mahatma, or great soul. One peculiar charac­
teristic about the Mahatmas are their apparent weariness and impatience, whenever a series of
questions are propounded. This will be easily confirnjed, by those who go to India, for it will
become apparent, that they dislike being interrupted in their meditation and development of Occult
Powers. You will, see comparatively little of them during your journey through India, and, indeed,
find it very difficult to approach them upon these subjects as they have a decided prejudice against
being interrogated or even taken notice of; but should it happen that they take a liking to you
they will enter into a conversation for an hour or more. On these occasions they always squat
on the ground and will invite you to do the same; and from their lips you will learn many strange
things that will sink deep into your heart and what comes from their lips will impress your soul
as being the truth. It is always better during these conversations to abstain from interrupting
them with questions for this will not be relished. However, it will be soon learned that this is
unnecessary, for with their marvelous, Spiritual Powers, and intuitive knowledge of what is passing
in your mind, during this discussion, they will answer your questions before you ask them and will
also explain difficult points in such a manner that the object will stand out “in relief” as it were,
assuming all the beauty and reality of a stereoscopic view.
If one of these Mahatmas likes you he will allow you to feast your eyes on his collection of
musty Kitaba (books) of Sanscrit, as the Hindu has a soul that believes in learning and is a great
believer in Ancient Occult books of instruction. He will carry them about with him in all his travels,
for he is never seeking information outside. He knows that, which he seeks will be found and
developed from the depth of his own being. In bringing you to where he keeps his books, he is
very likely to take you through many empty rooms or chambers, and cause you to descend stairs
in the darkness, but after he has lighted his candles he will display to your astonished eyes fifty
or a hundred volumes, many of them being over five hundred years old. He will now blow out his
candles, and you will find yourself surrounded with inky darkness. The Adept will then give a
certain ceremony, and suddenly as if by fate or some unseen power a flood of light will surround
you, and you will find yourself in a low chamber, apparently devoid of furniture, except an old
chest, a chair or two and a couple of animal skins on the floor. This light can certainly not be pro­
duced by any artificial means ; it will be bright as day, and of that unearthly refulgence, which on
more than one occasion will have startled you in certain feats of the Yoghees and Adepts of Central
India. Objects in this ghostly light cast no shadows ; and it is clearly proved that this source cannot
be an incandescent body like the sun, or any radiating light, and the best definition that can be given
of this light is that it is an illuminous Astral Fluid, which is suddenly precipitated from a given space
in which the object seems to be immersed. On many occasions this light will not extend beyond the
threshold of the apartment and it will not merge by gradual transition into the darkness of the cor­
ridor but will be cut off by a sharp demarcation. The same will be the case of the windows, which
are square holes in the wall, and there may be inky darkness and drizzling rain without. What will
strike you most profoundly is the fact that the Adept will never notice your surprise or agitation
which will manifest itself when you examine his literary treasures.
This Adept, whose hospitality you have been privileged to enjoy, you will find is not the only
denizen of his secluded hermitage among the ruins and temples, for there will be domiciled five
other recluses to whom the name of Adepts are applicable and two servants ; as a household of this
kind in India always consists of eight persons.
The Adepts as written above will be very seldom visible, for they spend most of their time in
the seclusion of their rooms ; each occupying a separate apartment in different wings of their ex­
clusive Temple. Their headgear consists of large turbans and long brown caftans. Sometimes they
will have errands to the neighboring hills and mountains and when this time comes these learned
Hindus will go in each other’s company and you will never be able to remember the time of ever
having known them to exchange a single word of greeting, for they act and conduct themselves like
deaf mutes, minus a sign language. The reason of this is, that they communicate with each other
only in mental language. It will not be long, however, before you realize that, while apparently mute,
these Masters carry on an active conversation with one another ; for they have simply risen above
the necessity of verbal speech. The development of Mental Telepathy and mind reading in India as
a national characteristic is amazing ; manifesting itself in the every day life of her people but reach­
ing its climax in the attainments of the Adepts of Occultism in central and northern India.
You will be very fortunate indeed if you do not find one or more of their number who has no
inclination whatever to associate with you, and he will act as if the stranger irritated or worried
him, and he ■will not deign to take the slightest notice of you, even ignoring your friendly greetings
(nn next nacei
_________ THE de LAURENCE COMPANY 21
when you happen to meet him. At the end of a considerable length of time he may condescend to
speak to you informing you among other things that he is a native of Rajputana (inferentially), a
person of high degree, but, owing to his unsympathizing nature or his illdisguised contempt for white
humanity there will be little satisfaction in your brief conversation with him. If you were to offer
one of these men 100 rupees
* to engage him in a conversation he would refuse the present on the
ground that asakye is not in need of money and he will beg to be excused. There may also be among
the number others who may seem somewhat less unsociable but even more taciturn; and they will
successfully foil every attempt you may make to draw them out unless you should establish yourself
on a friendly footing with them. There is to be found, however, among these recluses men who are
kind and amiable and whose memory will ever be among the brightest reminiscences of your India
career ; although amiable and kind these men may not be quite as communicative as you might see fit
to think but they will be invariably friendly, polite and almost deferential; their entire behavior con­
trasting favorably with the persistent moroseness of some of the older Adepts. The same may be
said of the Mongolian Adept, who is of a soft Mongolian caste with dreamy eyes. He has but re­
cently joined the brotherhood of India but seems to have become greatly attached to the Masters
who have apparently taken him for their Disciple.
*NOTE.—The rupee in India is the monetary Unit. In accounts it is divided in 16 annas, each of 12 pice, and in
Bombay sometimes into four quarters of 100 reis. The government rupee, the only one now minted, contains 165 troy
grains of silver. Its nominal value is 2 shillings English, or 48 cents American money, though its intrinsic value varies.
Accents are generally in rupees, of about 40 cents intrinsic value, or in English coin. The currency consists; of
British and .Spanish coins, rupees, eopper fanams, .-'nd cowries, or little shells, used by th© natives.
A fact that the Western student should fix well in his mind is that, to become a Chela (Disciple)
in the real teachings of Eastern Magic and Spiritism in India, does not persuppose great learning or
intellectual superiority on the part of the Initiate. The long years of probation, and the almost in­
credible hardships (such as fasting, sitting in one position for days, etc.) which are always inflicted
upon the Neophyte before he is deemed worthy of Initiation or reception into the “Adepts’ Brother­
hood” are more intended to test his physical endurance and to observe his trustworthiness, than to
give him knowledge of their Secrets or develop his Occult Powers. If the reader will kindly bear
with me I will in brief inform him, how, while in Northern India, a sincere soul secured Initiation
into this Mystic Brotherhood and its Occult Teachings and also relate a bit of his experience among
these silent and unobtrusive men whose wonderful feats have been the standing wonder of the
world, antedating the building of the first pyramids (for the early Jesuit Fathers were startled by
their Occult Miracles and being at a loss to account for them, very promptly attributed their power
to the Devil; and this foolish explanation, I regret to state is still persisted in by the unlearned,
who assert that it is even a sin to witness their Occult ana Spiritual feats, and who anathematize
these Adepts in Art Magic as Agents of the Devil).
His first experience was many, many years ago, among the Hindu Adepts of Thrinagur or as
it is by some termed Serunagor, which has its location in the beautiful vale of Kashmar, which is
the capital of that ancient mountain Paradise of the mighty Himalayas. The city is one of ancient
and remote antiquity, and has during the last twenty centuries been venerated by the Buddhist of
Northern India, for in this old city the first Buddhist assemblage was held, in the sixth year of our
present era. At this assemblage an entirely new document in Sanscrit of the Sacred Canon was
indorsed. This canon was known as the “Bribketa” and was translated in Thibetan. These Sans­
crit writings when translated and bound filled over one hundred and fifty volumes. When he was
ready to leave Umballa town for Jalandhar in the valley of Punjab, a companion of his from whom
he had from time to time received advice and assistance and to whom he is to this very day greatly
indebted for his kindness, agreed to accompany him to Kashmar and introduce him to one of the
Master Lamas from whom he desired to obtain certain instruction. They reached Serunagor in the
middle of the rainy season after a long and tiresome journey through the jungle hills and mountains.
The next day after their arrival his friend was taken to his mat by a serious fever which was su­
perinduced as the result of a snake bite he had received a few days back in the mountains and had
been extremely careless in giving proper treatment. He was now confronted with a new difficulty
(for at that time he had had very little experience with the Adepts and less with the mountainous
country of Northern India), that of finding the Master Lama, for his friend, who was by this time
delirious from the fever, and after placing him in suitable hands he determined to go ahead by him­
self, deeply regretting his friend’s illness and the fact that he had neglected to ask of him the exact
location of the habitation of the Lama whom he supposed of course some of the native Hindus in
that locality would know or at least be able to direct him, but on inquiry he was surprised to learn
that nobody knew or had ever heard of the Lama. The English residents did not know the Lama,
but the officer of the town directed him to a low Caste Faikree whose name was Zhenboa, but he
was not the Lama he was seeking; he inquired of all the Bazaars and of all the Shopkeepers but this
proved futile, and he gave up in despair and concluded to wait for his friend’s recovery, so he re­
turned to his friend’s sick room, and being quite tired and fatigued he went to sleep on a goatskin
beside his cot. How long he slept he was not certain, having no time only the Sun to go by, but he
was awakened some time after midnight, by something that startled him out of a sound sleep and
made every nerve in his body feel as if they were paralyzed, for he -was held as if by some invisible
power stronger than steel. I say steel, because if a man is bound by steel bands he can at least
move his muscles, which he was unable to do excepting those of his eyes. He opened his eyes and
in letters that had a weird and unearthly hue about them was written these words: “Travel north
five miles then seek advice from the shepherds.” The message which he since learned was trans­
mitted to him by Astral and Occult Powers, disappeared as suddenly as it had come and he felt
the terrible influence and power which had awakened him withdraw when he was startled the second
time by the outlines of a face which had manifested itself to him, although the room was perfectly
dark. The eyes were those of a genuine Hindu, dark, piercing and steady. They gave him a look
that went to the bottom of his soul and then the face disappeared. He obtained very little sleep the
balance of that night, as he had at that time had no experience in these mysterious revelations and
Occult Projection of the Astral Body consequently sleep and he were strangers the balance or that
night. He arose early next morning, and burned a good fumigation at the feet of his sick companion
and started over the mountains in a northerly direction. Why he went he could not explain, even to
himself, as the country was strange and rough and it is not considered safe to journey through
these parts of India alone, owing to a certain low class of natives or thugs who waylay a traveler
and throw a cloth or bag over nis head, then murder him by cutting his throat and bury his body
after robbing it of any valuables they may find thereon. He thought of all tins, but some invisible
power kept urging him on and whenever he -was inclined to hesitate or turn back his mind would
revert back to the words, “Travel north five miles, seek advice from the shepherds ” and he kept
on his way. When after traveling about three hours, without seeing any sign of the shepherds, and
being tired, he sat down and rested undecided just what to do. He felt that he would not dare go
against the presentiment and warning that had been given him during the night but he must confess
he would rather have been back in Benares than in those mountains alone. However, he determined
for the satisfaction of his own mind to start again, when a voice startled him by saying directly in
his ear, “Go Northeast” He turned quickly around, vexed at being spoken to in this way, expecting
to see somebody, but to his dismay he was entirely alone, everything being quiet and still around
himv He now began to think that he too was becoming a victim of the mountain fever, which often
suddenly attacks a man in the Oriental countries, but his own good sense told him better for, every
organ and function in his body was perfectly healthy and normal. But to be brief, he started in
the direction the voice had bid him go and after traveling about—what he judged to be two and a
half miles he found himself among the local sheep raisers that inhabit the mountains and valleys
(Continued on next page)

Northwest of Senguna. A Mohammedan sheep raiser .who knew the Lama readily consented td
conduct him to his abode so he engaged the Mohammedan as a guide and at Sunset he found himself
in the presence of the Great Adept and Lama, tired and weary, after his long journey, and you
may imagine his surprise when he saw that the Lama’s eyes and face were identical with those
which had looked at him after he was awakened from his sleep and told to go north and seek
advice from the shepherd.
There were the same black piercing eyes that seemed to be able to read every thought in his
soul. There was the same stern face, a face, judging from its appearance, that had had the smile
stripped from it as the winter blasts strip the leaves from the trees, for although he remained
in this master’s society for many years, he never saw a smile change its stern settings. The
habitation of this grand Adept was justly in keeping with the stern reality of his face and eyes'.
It consisted partially of the sides of an ancient Popado, being of Buddhist type, there being many
of these old structures still standing in Northern India and Thibet. This ancient Buddhist Papado
has been turned into a Lamasery, after being almost wrecked by the Mongols, but without doubt
it had been used for other purposes during the many centuries. This old Monastery stood in the
midst of the lonely mountains which the hand of nature had not slighted but had rendered it more
beautiful than any place he has ever seen, either in the United States or Europe, by covering the
surrounding country with a mantle of beautiful verdure, this nature seemed to have done in a
sense of pity to cover up the dreary memorials of the past centuries. His Master was by no
means the only inhabitant of this Monastery with its fascinating vale and ancient ruins. There
were five other Lamas besides two Hindu menials, one of which performed the duties of gardner
and sheep raiser, the other acted as housekeeper and cook. This strange Monastery presented a
most uninviting appearance, but to the true Disciple of Magic and East Indian Occultism it is like
the workshop of the faithful mechanic, or the room of a country school house to the untutored soul
seeking education. The Lama had evidently been faithfully watching for him, for as they approached
the weird Temple a tall thin man stepped from behind a long row of carved pillars and piously
descending the Ancient marble steps, extended his hand to him as a genuine token of welcome.
This, as he had suspected, was his master ; the Lama he had traveled over a hundred miles of moun­
tainous country to partake of his hospitality and receive the wealth of Occult Knowledge which
the Lama could give him and under whose tutelage he has augmented his knowledge of East
Indian Occultism until today he would not exchange the Lama’s teachings and the knowledge of
Spiritualism which he gave him for the crown of a King or the wealth of a nation. This great
Master was of a tall slender physique while his features were more emaciated than any person he
has ever beheld; yet the Lama’s face was not one that would impress you as being repulsive, in
fact, one would be inclined to call it pleasant were it not for a certain solemn set expression
about the forehead and lips, a sure indication of sternness and uncompromising individuality. This
priest’s dress was selected along certain aesthetic lines. He wore a turban of red and purple
Turkish cloth, a dark purple caftan hung loosely from his shoulders while his slippers were made
of goat skin. His appearance would strike one on the whole as being rather singular and even
odd in this beautiful spot of Mystic India, which is a strange and weird couptry where one meets
at every turn the unexpected and unusual, and the traveler from the Western country finds it
most difficult not to realize that he is indulging in a dream. “So you are the Munshi that has
journeyed all the way from Benares (the Holy City of India),” he said addressing him in Tamie,
this being the only tongue which he was able to speak at that time with any degree of fluency.
“You do not talk like a Sutra Karan (man from the West),” said the Adept, as he walked to a great
Mango tree and sat down on the ground beneath its branches in true Hindu fashion, with legs
crossed, and invited him to do the same, which he did. “I see that you have already been advised
of my coming,” he said to the Lama. “I have received no verbal message of any kind for over
fifty years,” answered the Lama, seemingly offended at his assertion. “Then how did you learn
of my arrival; and who told you that I came here with the intention of becoming a Chela (Dis­
ciple) of Oriental Occultism,” he replied, very much astonished, but still positive that some one
had informed the Lama. “I knew months ago you were coming,” replied the Lama, “and nobody
told me of it. I saw you asleep beside your sick friend, and besides, I also saw you cross the
river Sutley, and can describe some of your trials on the way through the mountains and after I
do so you can judge for yourself whether any person has told me anything concerning your in­
tentions or journey here.” And to his utter astonishment and amazement the Lama described day
by day his condition of mind and intentions for over a year back. The Lama also gave him a
complete description of his journey step by step; the places where he had stopped, and even des­
cribed the revelation as it appeared to him when he was awakened while asleep at the bedside of
his sick companion. Of this he had not mentioned a single word to anyone. The Lama even
challenged him to ask questions concerning his past life or future intentions and when he did so
the Lama unhesitatingly answered them with such precision and accuracy that it amazed and
bewildered him. He no longer wondered why the common people of India and the travelers from
Europe and the United States had such profound respect for these great Masters of Occultism
and Spiritism, and why the Western student feels so inclined towards their teachings as to study
them; for there/ is indeed great merit in such an undertaking; for the true Adept and Master
Lama of India turns nobody from his door who is sincere and will be a good true Chela (Dis­
ciple) of their wonderful teachings. “I have a place here where you can remain free,” the
Lama said. “It is near my own room. The less you bring of your material belongings into the
Monastery the better, for there is no greater foolishness than that of having a lot of things around
you that are useless, as they only serve to attract your attention from the development of Occult
and Spiritual Powers.”
The Lama now led the way up the stone steps through a dimly lighted corridor to a spacious
court beyond the center of the engraved pillars between which -was suspended a blanket; curtains
and blankets serve as doors in these Monasteries, as they keep out sun and are impervious to rain.
After passing through the door his Master led him along the passage way to a room on the right
of it. The floor of stone and mortar was covered with a matting of coir; the furniture con­
sisted of a chest of Spanish cedar, handsomely carved and stained a dead black, a chair and a,
sleeping couch. This consisted of a camel skin fastened to wooden bars so as to leave a low-
place between them. There was also a pair of clean red blankets but no pillow of any descrip­
tion. When he remarked of this deficiency the Lama quickly informed him that he who must,
have a pillow to rest his head on has no chance of raising above the level of the materialist and':
that he must do without one ; for it is of great importance that during sleep your head should be on.
a level with the rest of your body and that you always sleep on your back for only in that position
can the soul and brain be brought to develop that which it is deficient in; namely, an Occult.
Perception of the Astral and Spiritual forces. It is thus that he stood in the room which for a
number of years was destined to serve as his bed-room and apartment for solitary meditation,
and study. In this room of stone it was his humble privilege towitness and experience some of
the strangest and most weird Occult and Spiritual phenomena that will ever cow within the*
experience pr under the observation of any student or investigator of East Indian Occultism or

ORIENTAL SPIRITISM AND EAST INDIAN MAGIC.
"All things are possible for him who applies himself,'' providing, of course, that the power
desired be ln conformity with man's Occult and Spiritual Powers and the working forces of the
Splrltual Universe or Astral World, which are in unity with him, and he with them, then all things
will be directed to the ends· of his obtaining Wisdom, Astral and Occult Power.
This Occult Power and Astral Energy uWized by the Hindoo Adepts is not, in the true sense
of the word, the working of a miracle, but it is the working and bringing into operation a Hidden
and Subtle Astral Energy or Force, which is Invoked by the Adepts in Art Magic, ln a most posi­
tive and unequivocal way. East Indian Occultism is but tbe science or knowledge of tbe Secret
and Hidden laws of man's Spirit and Astral Forces. The terms Secret and Hidden are used by
the writer as meaning that the laws and rules necessary to bring these forces into operation are
hidden from the Materialist; that Is to say, he cannot see them with his physical eyes. The
knowledge and laws of these hidden forces are given to all who seek sincerely and apply them­
selves faithfully to attain them and become identified therewith, for this higher Esoteric knowledge
and Spirit Power is "East Indian Occultism, pure and simple."
Oriental Spiritism and East Indian Magic are venerable with age, having their origin ln anti­
quity and the far East, especially in Central and Northern India, where it has been handed down
from prehistoric times through generations, and generations. It is now being popularized, epito­
mized and vigorously promulgated in Europe, as it seems that the time has now come, when the
Western World and Europe have ceased to follow the teachings pf every so-called Professor and
Institute of Science, who can only afford to send a few cheap books which are worse than no
knowledge to the student. Whlle the writer has no prejudices for these partial and incomplete
so-called teachings, he knows, from personal experience, that the student and true soul are hun­
gering for a more perfect and specific course of study for the promulgation of the true East
Indian Occultism, that is so well understood and taught by the true Adept. For, "when that
which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away with."
The true student and Disciple, however, must have a substantial basis of instruction in his
understanding of Occult and Astral laws before he can develop the proper power to exercise
these Hidden Focces which !mow neither limitation nor failure and, which clothes its possessor
with a strange and invincible Occult power. I have la.bored long ana hard by precept and example
to Jmpress the true knowledge and the fundamental principles of East Indian Occultism on the
mlnas of my Disciples and plant that basis in, the souls of true· Chelas, who have in turn faithfully
transmitted the substance of that which they have received from me to the faithful soul who
applies to them for it. It has always been my aim and sole object in life to give an analytical
epitome of Hindu Magic and East Indian Occuitism and to teach my Chelas (Disciples) the
fundamental principles of Occultism and Spiritism as it is now taught and practiced in India, and
to teach my students that these powers lie hidden in their soul and are highly susceptible to
cultivation if they only obtain the proper knowledge of applying themselves to their laws. My in­
structions and books are today looked upon as standard and authentic, for they have been pub­
lished and sold·not in a spirit or desire for gain, but in a spirit which "speaks and it is done, which
commands and it stands fast."
Many wise heads in the Western countries have attempted lo create the baseless impression
that this Occult and Spirit Power was exceptional in human experience and, necessarily as such,
was supernatural and miraculous. It never occurred to them that these strange Occult and
Astral powers were the possible legitimate working of an Occult law and Power which could be
practically studied, mastered and applied by all mankind who would seek and desire them. Never­
theless, an unbiased and careful consideration of the direct and true teaching of the Adepts will
convince the most hesitating and conservative mind that the Adepts and Masters of these Occult,
Astral and Spirit Powers in India, regard the possession and exercise of these Hidden Powers
as being possible for every sincere soul who desires them, for they are without any doubt what­
soever, the orderly and legtimate result of certain Occult and Spiritual attainments, possible to
all, and which it is their special work lo give to all who sincerely desire them.
These teachings of Magic and Occultism have hitherto been so exclusively studied from the
standpoint of the supernatural that the attention of the whole Western world has been diverted
from a rational and' practical study of those Occult and Astral Powers exercised by the Hindus.
The Hindu Adepts, however, are very profound in their statements that these teachings are
equally important to all of mankind who wish to rise to a higher Mental and Spiritual Plane.
The true teachings of these wonderful men embrace every phase of a legitimate Occult Power,
Knowledge, Soul-sight and Astral Forces ever claimed or sought for by any Magi or Hierophant
of the world and their teachings are for and may be experienced and studied by the humblest.
It wlll be well to stale further, for the benefit of those who desire to become a Disciple in Indian
Occultism, that the source. of these Occult and Astral Powers, which in India are recognized and
specifically emphasized as free to all, is ascrilled to the direct enduement of the human soul and
from which every human soul derives its intelligence, life and power, and to which, therefore, all
alike, the humblest as well as the most exalted, have equal right and access.
ART OF SPIRIT INVOCATION.
Among these great Masters there is an atmosphere of unsoeiableness and a weird isolation
at their Temples and Lamaseries which will painfully affect the W<'stern man during the early
part of his sojourn and to which he can never quite reconcile himsP,lf, unless he makes up his
mind to become a Chela (Disciple) of these quiet, unobtrusive men, with their fine eyes, which
reflect the Wisdom of many thousands of years.
For one who spends years among these Masters, and who perfectly understands the Art of
Spirit Invocation as well as reading the innermost thoughts of your soul
!
and who by enchantment
can hold a ce.-tain weird fascination over the Spirits of the Astral Pane so as to make them
obey their very wish, and who can send their own Astral Body away in space, will realize that a
great deal in life as ii Is lived in the West is an illusion. These Adepts and Lamas have dis­
covered the key that unlocks the Astral Forces within their soul. Their habits, nay, the entire
mode of life, of these men who have discoveted the frivolities and illusions of their Western
brother, and have chosen voluntary exile amid a forgotten past, is such as to foster a spirit and
atmosphere of exclusion and Asceticism for they have raised the veil that hides the mysteries of
time and space.
They know that they have a mission to pe-rform and teach to the worthy Chela (Disciple).
The meals of these men usually consist of boiled rice and fish curry, and is not served at regular
Intervals in a dining room, bul must be applied for individually i!l the kitchen. The meal is then
eaten by the Adepts in silence in the privacy of their own apartments. In India will be found
thousands of Individuals of the type who belong to the lower Caste, or class of common Falkree,
for comparatively few of these Faikrees have risen or will ever ris'!, to a degree of Occult and
Spirit Power equal to that possessed by these Adepts who live in absolute seclusion. Like the
hermits of the Middle Ages these men live in austere seclusion, either in the solitude of India's great
forests or In the mountain country, always selecting some locality as remote as possible from the
contingency of disturbance.
Their place of abode, sometimes only a primitive bamboo hut. is often very cunningly and
neatly constructed by their own hands, in imitation of nature, to insure concealment or attract
as little :i,ttention as possible, so that even the expert hunter will often pass by tho?se silent retreats
without ID t!).e Jeast suspectiJ)9 !h�lr presence. These masters, from time to time, wUI leave their
•
(Contlnucd on m•xt oni,e)
24 THE de LAURENCE COMPANY
hidden retreats in the hills or their mountain caverns and suddenly appear in the larger cities of
India, where at once they are surrounded by an interested crowd of spectators, and it is useless
to say that the common people of India have the most profound respect for the Adepts and
Master Lamas. A miracle of some kind is performed in broad daylight (and witnessed perhaps by
five thousand people), then a sermon on the future life of the human soul of the most impressive
character is delivered. These masters scornfully refuse money, or any kind of remuneration.
These Adepts, properly named Philosophers, are men who have risen above all needs and who
seldom if ever make use of their Astral and Occult Powers for the furtherance of any tangible
object. These men are engaged in a process of development which will bring them to a higher
degree of Occult and Spiritual Powers. They live in the strictest seclusion and never go out to
nerform feats for money. They have been pronounced selfish by shallow reasoners, who are
apt to inquire why the Adepts and Lamas, instead of seeking refuge in seclusion and solitude, do
not go about performing their strange Occult feats for money and proclaim their Occult attain­
ments from the housetops. This latter occupation does not form a part of these great Phil­
osopher’s plans; in other words, their only desire is to teach the true sincere soul who will
abandon Materialism and become their Chela (Disciple). They are not preparing to become a
teacher of the curious multitude or unscrupulous ; for if they were to do this they could not be
what they are, nor reach the lofty height to which they aspire. The reader may be naturally
inclined to ask, Why don’t some of them go to Europe or the United States* and by exhibiting their
Occult Powers, make fortunes. The Adepts have no desire for a fortune. It would be just as
foolish to ask why the Prophets or the Apostles of Christ, that are spoken of in the Old Testi-
ment, did not turn their peculiar Occult and Spiritual gifts into a moneymaking business. . These
Masters are beyond the desire for money (something that is very difficult for an American to
realize). They know that it is only a brief span of earthly existence that separate mankind from
his Spiritual Life, and their contempt for material gain and wealth is only equaled by their pity
for those who are incessantly engaged in its pursuit.
These gifted Masters have a mission to perform for mankind in their own peculiar way. Their
wonderful Occult and Spiritual Powers (which are as boundless as they are marvelous) are their
credentials, and they are like the phophets of old they work Occult wonders and miracles in
order to attract and arrest the attention of those who they desire to deliver their solemn sermon
of advice, which never fails to impress the listener differently from anything he has ever heard
from mortal tongue. These miracles are equal to those recorded in the New Testament, as
worked by Christ, for, except the raising of the dead, not one of them is half so wonderful as
the Occult feats performed by the average Yoghee and Adept of India, and those of you who, be­
lieve the age of miracles is past should by all means travel in India, Thibet, Burmah, Siam, Benares
(the holy city of India), and Ceylon. People talk of the riddle of the Sphynx on the River.
There is a Sphynx far more mysterious in India, and it presents features of a thousand more
riddles. It will be seen that these Seers and Adepts only use their Occult Powers and work their
miracles to impress the people to raise themselves to a higher degree of Spiritual and Mental
development. The miracles were the credentials of the Prophets and it is to be doubted very much
whether Christ Himself could have produced much of an impression upon the Jews of Palestine
if He had not worked his miracles. This the gospel explicitly tells you, for you usually find the record
of the performance of a miracle by Christ followed by the words, “And he (or they) believed in
Him.” Thus, it appears that the miracles of Christ and his apostles, were only intended to demon­
strate their Divine Character and to open the eyes of the multitude.
“ESOTERIC BROTHERHOOD OF ADEPTS.”
The Chela, or Disciple of Hindu Magic who desires to become an Adept or High Caste Yoghee,
after a lifetime of contemplation and study is admitted into a higher circle of Esoteric Brotherhood,
whose seat is in the Monasteries and Temples in the mountain recesses of Northern Hindustan. The
Masters of this Brotherhood are quiet, suave and secretive and attach a deep religious significance
to the manifestation of their Occult and Astral Powers, and there is certainly nothing improbable
in the statement that they are initiated into a knowledge of Spiritism and Occult Secrets, which have
been preserved and handed down for centuries, from generation to generation. These Adepts, dur­
ing an Invocation or Conjuration of Astral Spirits are squatted down in the Hindu fashion, with
their legs crossed on a mat of cocoanut fibre, placed upon the stone floor of their Monasteries.
This position and the burning of Temple Incense is at once interpreted by the Spirits of the Astral
Plane as a sign that they are about to receive a deep and solemn Invocation for their appearance for
the performance of some duty or to give some knowledge. These Masters and Adepts are always
squatted down in a semi-circle, which forms an impressive and beautiful sight This circle of
silent, dark-eyed Orientals is one of sincerity and deep repose, such as is seldom found, even among
the Christians of the West.
OCCULT MYSTERY BEHIND CURTAIN OF MATERIALISM.
The Western Student has long desired the proper advice for pursuing these studies and the
writer knows his great anxiety to learn the truth, and there are many thousands thirsty for this
Occult knowledge who have journeyed over the rough paths of life in the hope of obtaining a spark
of that Occult Wisdom which they have hitherto sought for in vain, and there are in the United
States and Europe many who would willingly travel a doz^n times around the world if by so doing
they could secure but a momentary glimpse behind the curtain of Materialism, which hides the solu­
tion of all the mysteries by which mankind is surrounded on the Earth Plane. These sincere
searchers after Occult knowledge have derived little satisfaction from the teachings of the Scientists
and Professors of the West. However, failure only excites the fundamental desire in a true soul
for any certain knowledge. That there is a curtain that hides these revelations cannot be denied, as
every Scientist and Scholar will admit, but there are many of them that will never be able to raise
it until they leave off their study of Materialism and study and develop the Occult power within
them.
There are some who make a mistake in thinking that many mysteries are concealed behind this
great curtain, for it conceals one only, but to the Western man and Student, whether he observes
this Occult mystery during his Earth life or in his Spirit Life, it will be a terrible one to behold.
Man during his Earthly Existence can only explain an object in terms which refer to similar objects,
and the Spirit World behind this curtain is so utterly unlike the world revealed to man by his physical
senses that he could not understand these mysteries unless he became a Chela (Disciple) of them
for even the Master could not assist him unless he was sincere. The habits of these great Adepts,
and the entire mode of life of these men who have discarded the frivolities and illusions of their
kind and have chosen this voluntary exile amidst the ruins of a forgotten past is such as to foster
a spirit of exclusiveness and asceticism. However, there is a strange fascination in solitude, for
man, being a singular admixture of the bestial and Divine, and, when in the society of others, delights
in being gay and trivial and in developing the foolish and ignoble side of his nature, but, when sur­
rounded by solitude and his own thoughts, he becomes a different being, for he is left to his own
meditations. The silence of the desert or the unbroken quietness of some secluded nook, or the
silence of the Temple, awaken and develop Occult Powers and feelings within him, which his out­
ward and daily life can never engender, for it is then, and only then, that man will voluntarily
descend into the abysimal depths of his own consciousness. The very first lesson of the Western.
Disciple or Neophyte under the great Eastern Adepts of India, and the miracles he will witness at
the hands of these Masters, is sufficient to illustrate the method of the Master with his Disciple-.,
and the Character also of his Occult Power ; for the life depicted at the Lamaseries of Northern
India and the character of these mep who form a silent and Austere Brotherhoods Qf Adepts, will’

give him a good insight into the nature of the Indian Recluse life and the influence it has upon the
character of those who have adopted it, and he will never regret the instructions and knowledge that
will be given him to develop his interior concentration and for the attainment of illumination of his
inner or Clairvoyant Vision. These Masters of Occultism have sprung from a wonderful race of
people, who, for over fifty centuries have subordinated matter to mind, and who have succeeded in
reducing their physical wants to a minimum. They are of Soul and Mind and the Western man is
of body and stomach. The Hindu’s knowledge of the mysterious forces of mind and Astral Life is
far in advance of that in the possession of the Western man, for they have spent centuries in
introspective meditation and have acquired a mastery of Clairvoyancy, Telepathy and Spiritism such
as the Western mind can neither understand or appreciate, for even their knowledge of Hypnotism
is far ahead of anything of which he can ever conceive.
OCCULT VISION.
The marvelous manner in which messages can be communicated or the great rapidity of that
which news of an important character travels through India is a case in point; thus for instance,
the details of any event that occurs in Maineaud will be discussed in the bazaars and shops of
Calcutta many hours before news and particulars are received by telegraph, to the utter astonish­
ment and disgust of the telegraph company. This, in spite of the fact that the company has the
advantage of sending despatches through the valley of the Kabul River and through the Khyber pass
to Feshawur. These telegrams sometimes come to Calcutta as cypher messages and it would be
nonsensical to say that this news has traveled from mouth to mouth, or from village to village, as
there are many intervening mountain ranges and great deserts, villages and hamlets in India that
are many miles apart and extensive ranges where scarcely any habitation is to be met with.
Besides, the Native Hindus are not much given to travel and there is positively no means of com­
munication by means of letters or messages of any sort that could be sent with such speed. The
news of the disaster that befell the Spanish Navy at the Phillipines when Dewey destroyed their
boats, took many hours and days to reach Washington and to be communicated to the cities and
towns throughout the United States. In India this news'would have been known all over the land
in less than one hour, and not merely in the sense of a vague presentiment or impression that
something had happened to the Spanish Navy, but in the shape of a distinct, clear Occult vision,
which, although not seen or understood by the low caste natives of India, would be beheld by hun­
dreds and thousands who are developed clairvoyantly, and they would not be slow to communicate
this to their fellow being.
THE DEMON OF PERVERSITY.
The Western student at times thinks to become a Chela (Disciple) or to be Initiated into East
Indian Occultism, is to pass through the “valley of roses,” and that he will ultimately reach the
object of his desire and become quickly initiated into the various degrees of Esoteric Wisdom,
but the student should understand that every investigator was once where he now is, and well
remembers the impatience and madness of despair which more than once overwhelmed him as he
realized the stupendousness of the task before him; how his heart almost failed him, how more than
once he was on the point of giving up the battle1. Wealth, ease, sensuality, appetite and a thousand
and one delusive pleasures wh ch hold the bhaila (materialist) in bonds. He had abandoned and had
almost completely subdued and mastered these evil propensities .(the curse of a thousand years
of animality, materialism and sensuality) with which the Western race is afflicted. Yet such is
the demon of perversity all powerful through the inherited blindness and viciousness of a benighted
and bespotted past, it required all the fierce determination of which he was capable to persist in the
upward path to Eternal Truth and Wisdom. “Through darkness to light, through sorrow, through
evil, through the turbulent tides and waves of destiny and will, through all the forms of fate,
ambition and revenge”—let this be every student’s motto in the course of ascent. The greater
the trial and obstacles, the greater the triumph, and although meditation and seclusion are to be
recommevded under all circumstances, if the Disciple-of Magic is of the right calibre, he will
succeed. If it is possible for him to do so, let him study “The Great Book Of Magical Art,
Hindu Magic, And East Indian Occultism,” listed elsewhere in this catalogue.
The path to Occultism lies everywhere and nowhere. Occult and Astral Powers and
Eternal-Truth man must seek for and develop, even to the depths of his own soul. There is
no royal road to success in Hindu Magic and East Indian Occultism. You must climb the
side of every mountain to stand upon its summit.
VAUNTED CIVILIZATION.
The Hindus are a race which are immeasurably older in mental culture and larger in mental
calibre than the Western people. The Western so-called civilization is but of a yesterday, and you
are merely engaged in the Eternal process of multiplying your wants. You have abnormally
developed and stimulated the accumulative instinct so that you have actually come to look upon life
as a mere opportunity of accumulating wealth in the shape of so-called Material possessions.
What otherwise can be the meaning of your saying that time is money, which would greatly amuse us
if it would not have the gloomy and saddening thought which underlies it. I repeat again that
what you call your glorious and modern civilization is, and has been, nothing but a process of
multiplying your wants (that which are necessaries now were luxuries thirty years ago), and the
more you will have to labor and toil in order to supply and gratify them; You will also have to
devote an ever-increasing part of your life to the procuring of the means wherewith to gratify
your artificial wants ; you are, indeed, slaves of your wants and desires, for each new want implies
a new sorrow, namely, the sorrow experienced in the deprivation of the means to gratify it. A
hundred wants mean a hundred sorrows; a hundred disappointments, a hundred pains. Now 1
will ask you, has the standard of happiness been raised even to the extent of one-half inch’by
your much vaunted civilization? I say no; on the contrary, you suffer more than your forefathers
did in any given period, because they lived in a simple and more frugal manner and their wants were
fewer. They had more time to rest and think.
The multiplicity of your wants has brought about a feverish activity, and in your so-called
“struggle for existence” you have actually come to look upon your fellow man in the light of an
enemy. You try to overcome him by stealth and by every modification of craft; you try to oust
him from business and drive him to the wall. This is what you complacently call the the survival of
the fittest, a kind of password which you have invented in order to appease your not over-delicate
conscience. Survival of the fittest, forsooth I Who is it that survives in your present struggle
for existence? Is it the most humane, the most sensitive, the most generous, the most altruistic?
No, it is the most merciless, the most selfish, the most unscrupulous; the very type whose extinc­
tion would be desirable in the interest of the race.
The Hindu Adepts, on the other hand, after having risen to a certain height of material culture,
have paused and reflected, and have begun to reduce their wants to a minimum. They live on rice,
and most of them are satisfied with one meal a day. A teacupful of boiled rice, with a little salt, is
all that they need in the line of food ; and as for shelter, why a few bamboo sticks thatched with
palm leaves, will jnore than suffice. All their immediate wants, if translated into time, would mean
less than twenty minutes’ work per day ; they can devote all the rest of their time to mental and
spiritual culture, to thinking—not to book study, but to the solution of the World’s Occult Mystery.
They have done a good deal of thinking, as you are prepared to admit; they have developed during
these last fifty centuries, mind faculties which are a source of constant surprise to you; In fact,
while you have been working for the stomach, they have been working for the soul and mind. You
Westerners, in fact, are all stomach, and we are all soul, mind and brain.

How To Gain True Spiritual Power
By de Laurence
Every investigator of Occultism and Spiritualism will find it well to do as Solomon
did, that is, desire Wisdom and Spiritual Knowledge above all other things; even wealth
and power. If a man has dominion over the Spiritual and Occult Powers of Nature, and
is able to overcome his enemies, assist his friends, ward off failure, disease, Evil Spirits,
and baneful influences, he will bring comfort to his soul and be secure at all times.
The one who has Spiritual Knowledge, and who is instructed and helped by Good
Spirits, will have much assistance given to him in the shape of Divine Revelation.
It is a wise man, who, like Solomon, makes a sincere attempt to understand and in­
terpret the Occult, that is, Hidden Laws of Nature; for if one does not make an honest
attempt to seek and search out the truth and obtain Divine Wisdom, he is only a self­
assumed inspired interpreter.
Every one should consider the authenticity of the teachings of Jesus and the Great
Lesson taught by a study of His life from Bethlehem To The Cross. There are not many
today like King Solomon, the “wise man." They are seeking material things instead of
trying to obtain Spiritual Knowledge and Divine Wisdom.
There is much to learn regarding the different forms of Adjuration and Conjuration
as well as the Weird Ceremonies and Practices carried out in the different parts of the
world, especially the Orient and Egypt. Much of this knowledge has been handed down
from generation to generation, by the Adepts of the middle ages. The one who wished
to Invoke Spirits entered a Circle at Midnight. What the Exorcist most desired was to
dislodge and drive away Evil Spirits. To Adjure Evil Spirits. When the Exorcist drove
away the Evil Spirits, the poor soul which had been tormented by them, was comforted
in the name of the Savior, and consigned to the care of the Good Spirits.
One White And One Yellow Candle
Certain days were set aside as most favorable for the practice of Exorcism of Evil
Spirits. If the Evil Spirits were difficult to drive away Temple Incense in powdered form,
was burned. One. White and One Yellow Candle was also burned between the hours of
midnight and one A. M., for driving away the Evil Spirits and Invoking the good ones.
To this I will also add that no genuine Spiritualist has ever denied that he had
learned much from “Spirits,” whether, being a Medium, they acted independently of him,
or he had been Initiated into the Science of Occultism by a Master.
From the above it will be observed that he who despises Occultism, and makes no
endeavor to gain True Spiritual Knowledge will be miserable; his hope in vain; his labors
unfruitful and his works unprofitable. As to true Spiritual Knowledge and Divine Wis­
dom, it is true that Solomon possessed the Power of Spirit Invocation.
When the Queen of Sheba arrived at Jerusalem, Bennayahu, the son of Yehoyadah,
eonducted her to the palace of Solomon.
Solomon prepared to receive his visitor in an apartment laid and lined with glass,
and the Queen at first was so deceived by the appearance that she imagined the King to be
sitting in water. And when the Queen had tested Solomon’s Occult and Spirit Powers,
she said:
"I believed not what I heard about Spiritual Powers but now I have come, and my eyes have
seen it all; behold, the half has not been told to me. Happy are the servants who stand before
thee continually to listen to thy words of wisdom. How I envy them.”
King Solomon had great powers- of Prophecy.
There are many who do not understand how the Human Soul has within itself the
Power to See and Know Things of the Past, Present and Future. They will seek by lab­
orious effort to develop Mediumship and Clairvoyant Power. The wise man recognizes
that this power lies within and is manifested only through the law of faith and realiza­
tion. The infinite is not known through the reason . . . but by a faculty superior to
reason, by entering upon a state in which the individual, ceases to be his finite self, in
which state things concerning the Past, Present and Future are communicated to him.
All of this, and a great deal more is taught in my “Great Book Of Magical Art, Hindu
Magic, And East Indian Occultism," which has had a steady sale for 30 years.
Many can see the Present and the Future. This is what may be termed Spiritual
Photography. The soul is the Camera in which facts and events, future, past, and present,
are alike fixed; and the mind becomes conscious of them. Beyond our every-day world of
limits, all is as one day or state, the Past and Future comprised in the present.
The Inevitable
Mediumship may be either 1st, self developed; 2nd, by extraneous influences; or 3rd,
may remain latent throughout life. The reader must bear in mind the definition of the
term, for, unless this is clearly understood, confusion will be inevitable. Mediumship of
(Continued on Next Page)
THE de LAURENCE COMPANY 27
this kind may be either active or passive, repellent or receptive, positive or negative.
Mediumship is measured by the quality of the aura with which the individual is sur­
rounded. This may be dense, cloudy, and attract only Low Spirits, or it may be pure,
crystal-like. All depends upon the moral character of the medium.
Not only is it not possible for Evil Spirits to exist in their pure aura, but they cannot
even remain in that of obsessed persons, if the Master- exercises his will, or even ap­
proaches them. This is Mastership, not Mediumship. Such persons are Temples in which
dwell Good Spirits. If the Temple is defiled by the admission of an evil passion, thought
or desire, the mediator falls into the sphere of sorcery. The door is opened; the Pure
Spirits retire and the Evil Ones rush in. This is still mediatorship, -evil as it is; the
sorcerer, like the Pure Magician, forms his own aura and subjects to his will congenial
inferior spirits.
But Mediumship, as now understood and manifested, is a different thing. Circum­
stances, independent of his own volition, may, either at birth of subsequently, modify
a person’s aura, so that strange manifestations, physical or mental, diabolical, or angelic,
may take place. Such Mediumship, as well as the above mentioned Mediatorship, has
existed on earth since the first appearance here of living man. The former is the yielding
of weak, mortal flesh to the control and suggestions of Evil Spirits. It is literally obses­
sion and Possession; and Mediums, who pride themselves on being the faithful slaves
of their “guides,” and who repudiate with indignation the idea of “controlling” the mani­
festations, could not very well deny the fact without inconsistency. This Mediumship is
typified in the story of Eve succumbing to the reasonings of the Serpent; of Pandora
peeping in the forbidden Casket and letting loose on the world, Sorrow and Evil, and by
Mary Magdalene, who from having been Obsessed by “Seven Devils” was finally redeemed
by the triumphant struggle of her immortal spirit, touched by the presence of a Holy
Mediator.
Ulis Mediumship, whether beneficient or maleficient, is always passive. Happy are
the pure in heart, who repel unconsciously, by that very cleanness of their inner nature,
the Dark Spirits of Evil. For verily they have no other weapons of defense but that
inborn goodness and purity. Mediumship, as practiced by many, is a more undesirable
gift than the robe of Nessus.
The Obeah Woman Of Endor
The tree is known by its fruit. Side by side with Mediums and Clairvoyants march
the Adepts and Masters of Spiritualism and Occustism. The Ancient Witches andjhpse
who practice Witchcraft, by having a Familiar Evil Spirit, usually make of their gifts
a trade; and the Obeah Woman of Endor, though she may have killed her calf for Saul,
accepted money from other clients.
Sorcerers and Witches of America, Europe, Asia, India, and Africa, all exercise
their Evil Powers for money. Not so with Buddha, who refused his father’s throne.
"The Master Jesus, the World’s Greatest Mystic, had no where to lay his
head.” The chosen Apostles provided “neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in
their purses.” When the Apostles were offered money to impart their Spiritual
powers, Peter indignantly spurned the offer, saying:
“Thy money perish with thee; because thou hast thought that the gift
of God may be purchased with money.”
These men were Great Occult Masters, guided merely by their own soul, and availing
themselves of the help of Spirits only so far as these remain in the right path.
Mystic Occult Password
Great Occult Masters and Adepts, when asked to attend public Spirit Circles always
proudly answer: “It -is for them (the spirits) to come to me.”
I have asserted, and proved in my own case, that our soul can attain communion with
the Highest Spiritual Intelligences.
I ahvays drive away from my Invoking Ceremonies, when burning Incense, every
inferior Spirit, or Bad Spirit, which I teach my Disciples to recognize.
I always teach my students to attain a Divine Occult Power.
I have always taught that there is a “Mystic Occult Password” that will carry a
Medium from one Order of Spirits to another, Higher and Higher, till he arrived at the
Absolute Divine.
I have always spurned Sorcerers and common Soothsayers. One must live a peculiar
abstemious mode of life, one that will produce an acuteness of the senses and mental facul­
ties, so that the greatest and most remarkable things can take place.
Jesus declared man the lord of the Sabbath, and at His command Evil Spirits fled
from their temporary abodes; a power which is shared by every Great Initiate of Occult
Orders. Many of the Brotherhood of the Essenes of Judea and Mount Carmel also had
this power.
It is undeniable that there must have been some good reasons why the Ancients
persecuted Mediums who Invoked Evil Spirits. Otherwise why, at the time of Moses.
and David, and Samuel, should they have encouraged Prophecy and Divination, Astrology
and Soothsaying, and maintained Occult Schools in which these Natural Spiritual Gifts
were developed. Even at the time of Christ, witches and those who Divined by the Spirit
of Ob were driven to the tombs and waste places without the city walls.

MATERIALIZATIONS IN THE SACRED RECORDS
By de Laurence A Mystic
As for Materializations, they are many and various in the Sacred Records. But, were
they effected under the.same conditions as at modern seances? Darkness, it appears, was
not required in those days of Patriarchs and Magic Powers. The three angels who appeared
to Abraham drank in the full blaze of the sun, for “he sat in the tent-door in the heat of
the day,” says the book of Genesis. The spirits of Elias and Moses appeared equally in
daytime, as it is not probable that Christ and the Apostles would be climbing a high
mountain during the night. Jesus is represented as having appeared to Mary Magdalene
in the garden in the early morning; to the Apostles, at three distinct times, and generally
by day; once “when the morning was come.” (John XXI. If.) Even when the ass of Balaam
saw the “materialized” angel, it was in the full light of noon.
We find in the life of Christ—and in the Old Testament, too—“an uninterrupted
record of Spiritualistic Manifestations,” but nothing mediumistic, of a physical character
though, if we except the visit of Saul to Sedecla, the Obeah woman of EmDor. This is a
distinction of vital importance.
True, the promise of the Master Jesus was clearly stated:
"Aye, and greater works than these shall ye do"—works of Mediatorship.
According to Joel, the time would come when there would be an outpouring
of the divine spirit: "Your sons and your daughters,” says he, “shall prophesy,
your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.”
The time has come and they do all these things now; Spiritualism has its Seers and
Martyrs, its Prophets and Healers. Like Moses, and David, and Jehoram, there are
mediums who have direct writings from genuine planetary and human spirits; and the
best of it brings the mediums no pecuniary recompense.
There are a few, a very few, orators on the spiritualistic platform who speak by
inspiration, and if they know what is said at all they are in the condition described by
Daniel:
"And I retained no strength. Yet heard I the voice of his words: and
when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep.”
And there are mediums, these whom I have spoken of, for whom the prophecy in
Samuel might have been written:
"The spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, thou shalt prophesy with
them, and shalt be turned into another man.”
Mystical Allegories Behind The Veil
There are some who still hold the Key to Ancient Doctrines. There are others who
really believe in Spiritualism and Occult Philosophy. It was the old Venerable Adepts that
knew the real Secrets of Occultism and Art Magic as symbolically summarized by Moses
at the beginning of Genesis.
What Secret do these men bear with them to their tomb? Why are they wondered at
without being understood? Why are they condemned unheard? Why are they Initiates of
those terrific secret sciences of which the Church and society are afraid? Why are they
acquainted with things of which others know nothing? Why do they conceal what all men
desire to know? Why are they invested with a terrible Occult Power? The Occult Sciences!
Magic! These words will reveal all and give food for further thought!
Divine Wisdom
Let the judicious reader who makes a careful and earnest perusal of what is said
here, understand that all of this is of the true and Sublime Divine Wisdom and Occult
Philosophy that is manifest in the Material as well as the Spiritual World. For, let one first
understand the Mysterious Influence of the Spiritual upon the Material World and also upon
the mind and soul of mankind as well as to know how to dispose and fit himself so as to
be capable of receiving the Divine Operations of the Spiritual World, whereby he may be
enabled to operate many strange and wonderful things by a Natural Power. Such as to
expel Disease; to preserve Health; to prolong Life; to renew Youth; to Fore-tell Future
Events, etc., etc. All these things may seem strange and incredible, yet study the Spiritual
Laws of the Heavenly World, and read well those books which treat upon the same and
thou shalt see the possibility of these things confirmed both by thine own Wisdom and
by example.
And now a final word to sum this entire introduction. If you be blind like Samson
when you cast down the pillars of the Temple, its ruins will crush you. To command
Nature we must be above Nature by resistance of her attractions. If your mind be per­
fectly free from all prejudice, superstition, and incredulity, you will command spirits.
If you do not obey blind forces, they will obey you. If you be wise like Solomon, you will
perform the works of Solomon; if you be Holy like Christ, you will accomplish the works
of Christ. To direct the currents of the inconstant light, we must be established in the
constant light. To command the elements, we must have overcome their hurricanes, their
lightnings, their abysses, their tempests. In order to Dare we must Know; in order to
Will, we must Dare; we must Will to possess Power and to become Wise we must be Silent.

BETWEEN GOLDEN CANDLE STICKS
Seven Stars In His Hand
Symbol OfA Two-Edged Sword
By de Laurence A Mystic
Christ, the greatest of all the great said: "If the blind lead the blind, both fall into the
pit.” Today the spirit of Christ stands erect amidst falling institutions and collapsing
empires. It is this divine spirit, the spirit of the only Son of God, which St. John represents
in his Apocalypse, standing between Golden Candle Sticks, because He is the center of all
lights; having Seven Stars in His hand, like the seed of a new heaven; and sending down
His speech upon the earth under the symbol of a Two-edged Sword. When the wise in their
discouragement sleep through the night of doubt, of sorrow and failure, the spirit of Christ
is erect and vigilant. When nations, weary of the labor which emancipates them, lie down
and dream over their chains, the spirit of Christ is erect and protesting; When the blind
partisans of sterilized religions cast themselves in the dust of old temples, the spirit of Christ
is erect and praying. When the strong become weak, when virtues are corrupted, when all
things bend and sink down in search of shameful pasture, the spirit of Christ is erect, gazing
up to heaven, and awaiting the hour of His Father.
Christ signifies priest and kind by excellence. The Christ initiator of modern times
came to form new priests and new kings by science, and, above all, by charity. The ancient
Magi were priests and kings, and the Savior’s advent was proclaimed to them by a star. This
star was the magical pentagram, having a sacred letter at each point. It is the symbol of
the intelligence which rules by unity of force over the four elementary potencies; it is the
pentagram of the Magi, the Blazing Star of the children of Hiram, the prototype of equili­
brated light; to each of its points a ray of light ascends, and frpm each a ray goes forth;
it represents the grand and supreme athanor of nature, which is the body of man. The
magnetic influence issues in two beams from the head, from either hand, and from either
foot. The positive ray is balanced by the negative. The head corresponds with the two
feet, each hand with a hand and foot, each of the two feet with the head and one hand.
This ruling sign of equilibrated light represents the spirit of order and harmony; it is the
sign of the omnipotence of the magus, and hence, when broken or incorrectly drawn, it
represents astral intoxication, abnormal and ill-regulated projectcions of the astral light,
and, therefore, bewitchifients, perversity, madness, and it is what the Magi term the signa­
ture of Lucifer. There is another signature which also symbolizes the Mysteries of Light,
namely, the sign of Solomon, whose Talismans bear on one side the impression of his seal,
and on the other side a certain Secret signature, which when translated, means the Hiero­
glyphic theory of the composition of magnets, and represents the circulatory law of the
lightning.
Rebellious spirits are enchained by the exhibition of the blazing five-pointed star or
the seal of Solomon, because each gives them proof of their folly and threatens them with a
sovereign power capable of tormenting them by their recall to order. Nothing tortures the
wicked so much as goodness. Nothing is more odious to madness than reason. But if an
ignorant operator should make use of these signs without knowing them, he is a blind man
who discourses of light to the blind, “If the blind lead the blind,” said the great and divine
Hierophant, “both fall into the pit.”
And now a final word to sum this entire introduction. If you be blind like Samson when
you cast down the pillars of the temple, its ruins will crush you. To command nature we
must be above nature by resistance of her attractions. If your mind be perfectly free from
all prejudice, superstition, and incredulity, you will command spirits. If you do not obey
blind forces, they will obey you. If you be wise like Solomon, you will perform the works
of Solomon; if you be holy like Christ, you will accomplish-the works of Christ. To direct
the currents of the inconstant light, we must be established in the constant light. To com­
mand the elements, we must have overcome their hurricanes, their lightnings, their abysses,
their tempests. In order to Dare we must Know; in order to Will, we must Dare; we must
Will to possess empire, and to reign we must be Silent.
Prepare Yourself For Divine Wisdom
Every intention which does not assert itself by deeds is a vain intention, and the
speech which expresses it is idle speech. It is action which proves life and establishes will.
Hence it is said in the Sacred and Symbolical books that men will be judged, not according
to their thoughts and their ideas, but according to their works. We must act in order to be.
We have, therefore, to treat in this place of the grand and terrific question of magical
works; we are concerned no longer with theories and abstractions; we approach realties,
and we are about to place the rod of miracles in the hands of the adept, saying to him at
the same time: “Be not satisfied with what we tell you; act for yourself.” We have to
deal here with works of relative omnipotence, with the means of seizing upon the greatest
secrets of nature and compelling them into service of an enlightened and inflexible will.
Most known Magical Rituals are either mystifications or enigmas, and we are about tn
rend for the first time, after so many centuries, the veil of the Occult Sanctuary. To reveal
the holiness of mysteries is to provide a remedy for their profanation, such is the thought
which sustains our courage and enables us to face all the perils of this enterprise, possibly
the most intrepid which it has been permitted the human mind to conceive and carry out. •_
Magical operations are the exercise of a natural power, but one superior to the ordinary
forces of nature. They are the result of a science and a practice which exalt human will
beyond its normal limits. The supernatural is only the natural in an extraordinary grade,
or it is the exalted natural; a miracle is a phenomenon which strikes the mutlitude because)
it is unexpected; the astonishing is that which astonishes; miracles are effects which sur-
(Continued on Next Page)
THE de LAURENCE COMPANY
prise those who are ignorant of their causes, or Assign them causes which are not in pro­
portion to such effects. Miracles exist only for the ignorant, but, as there is scarcely any
absolute science among men, the supernatural can still obtain, and does so indeed for the
whole world. Let us set out by saying that we believe in all miracles because we are con­
vinced and certain, even from our own experience, of their entire possibility. There are
some which we do not explain, though we regard them as no less explicabel. From the
greater to the lesser, from the lesser to the greater, the consequences are identically related
and the proportions progressively rigorous. But in order to worjc miracles we must be out­
side of the ordinary conditions of humanity; we must either be abstracted by wisdom or
exalted by power, either superior to all passions or beyond them through ecstacy or frenzy.
Such is the first and most indispensable preparation of the operator. Hence, by a providen­
tial or fatal law, the magician can only exercise omnipotence in inverse proportion to his
material interest; the alchemist make so much the more gold as he is the more resigned to
privations, and the more esteems that poverty which protects the secrets of the magnum
opus. Only the adept whose heart is passionless will dispose of the love and hate of those
whom he would make instruments of his science; the myth of Genesis is eternally true, and
God permits the tree of science to be approached only by those men who are sufficiently
strong and self-denying not to covet its fruits. Ye, therefore, who seek in science a means
to satisfy your passions, pause in this fatal way; you will find nothing but dismal failure
or death. This is the meaning of the vulgar tradition that the devil ends sooner or later
by strangling sorcerers. The Magnus must hence be impassible, sober and chaste, disinter­
ested, impenetrable, and inaccessible to any kind of prejudice or terror. He must be without
bodily defects, and proof against all contradictions and all difficulties. The first and most
important of magical operations is the attainment of this rare pre-eminence.
We have said that impassioned ecstacy may produce the same results as absolute
superiority, and this is true as to the issue, but ont as to the direction of magical operations.
Passion forcibly projects the astral light and impresses unforeseen movements on the
universal agent, but it cannot check with the facility that it impels, and its destiny then
resembles Hippolytus dragged by his own horses, or Phalaris himself victimized by the
instrument of torture which he had invented for others. Human volition realized by action
is like a cannon-ball, and recedes before no obstacle. It either passes through it or is buried
in it, but if it advances with patience and perseverance, it is never lost; it is like the wave
which returns incessantly and wears away iron in the end.
Man can be modified by habit, which becomes, according to the proverb, his second
nature. By means of persevering and graduated athletics, the power and activity of the
body can be developed to an astonishing extent. It is the same with the powers of the soul.
Would you reign over yourselves and others? Learn how to will. How can one learn to
will? This is the first Arcanum of Magical Initiation, and it was to make it understood
fundamentally that the ancient depositaries of priestly art surrounded the approaches of
the sanctuary with so many terrors and illusions. They did not believe in a will until it
had produced its proofs, and they were right. Power is justified by victories. Indolence
and forgetfulness are enemies of will, and for this reason all religions have multiplied their
observances and made their worship minute and difficult. The more we restrain ourselves
for an idea, the greater is the strength we acquire within the scope of that idea. Are not
mothers more partial to the children who have caused them most suffering and cost them
most anxieties? So does the power of religions reside exclusively in the inflexible will of
those who practice them. So long as there is one faithful person to believe in the holy sac­
rifice of the Mass, there will be a priest to celebrate it for him; and so long as there is a priest
who daily recites his breviary, there will be' a pope in the world. Observances, apparently
most insignificant and most foreign in themselves to the proposed end, lead, notwithstand­
ing, to that end by education and exercise of will. If a peasant rose up every morning at two
or three o’clock, and went daily a long distance from home to gather a sprig of the same herb
before the rising of the sun, he would be able to perform a great number of prodigies by
merely carrying this herb upon his person, for it would be the sign of his will, and would
become by his will itself all that he required it to become in the interest of his desires. In
order to do a thing we must believe in the possibility of our doing, and this faith must
forthwith be translated into acts. When a child says: “I cannot,” his mother answers:
“Try.” Faith does not even try; it begins with the certitu.de of completing, and it pro­
ceeds calmly, as if omnipotence were at its disposal and eternity before it. What seek you,
therefore, from the science of the Magi? Dare to formulate your desire, then set to work
at once, and do not cease acting after the same manner and for the same end; what you
will shall come to pass, and for you and by you it has indeed already begun. Sixtus V.
said while watching' his flocks: “I desire to be pope.” You are a beggar and you desire to
make gold; set to work and never leave off. I promise you, in the name of science, all the
treasures of Flamel and Raymond Lully. “What is the first thing to do?” Believe in your
power, then act. “But how act?” Rise daily at the same hour, and that early; bathe before
daybreak and in all seasons; never wear dirty clothes, rather wash them yourself if needful;
accustom yourself to voluntary privations, that you may be better able to bear those which
come without seeking; then silence every desire which is foreign to the fulfillment of the
great work.
“What! By bathing daily, I shall make gold?” You will work in order to make it.
“It is a mockery!” No, it is an arcanum. “How can I make use of an arcanum which I fail
to understand? Believe and act; you will understand later.
One day. a person said to me: “I would that I could be a fervent Catholic, but I am a
Voltairean. What would I not give to have faith!” I replied: “Say, ‘I would’ no longer;
say ‘I will,’ and I promise you that you will believe. You tell me you are a Voltairean, and
of all the various presentations of faith that of the jesuits is most repugnant to you, but at
the same time seems the most powerful and desirable. Perform the exercise of St. Ignatius
again and again, without allowing yourself to be discouraged, and you will attain the faith
of a Jesuit. The result is infallible, and should you then have the simplicity to ascribe it
to a miracle, you deceive yourself now in thinking that you are a Voltairean.”
An idle man will never become an Occultist or a Spirit Magician. Magic is an exercise
of all hours and all moments. The operator of great works must be absolute master of
himself; he must know how to conquer the allurements of pleasure, appetite, and sleep, he
must be insensible to success and to indignity. His life must be that of a will directed by
one thought, and served by entire nature which, he will have made subject to mind in his
own organs, and by sympathy in all the universal forces which are their correspondents.
All faculties and all senses should share in the work: nothing in the priest of Hermes has
the right to remain idle; intelligence must be formulated by signs and summed by char­
acters or pantacles; will must be determined by words, and must fulfill words by deeds:
the magical idea must be rendered into light for the eyes, harmony for the ears and
Oriental Incense for the sense of smell. The operator in a word, must realize in his soul
life what he wishes to realize in the world without him; he must become a magnet to attract
the desired thing; and when he shall be sufficiently magnetic, he must be convinced that the
thing- will come of itself, and without thinking of it.

AN ANCIENT AND VENERABLE SCHOOL
By de Laurence
In the Far East is to be found an Ancient and Venerable School, which is older than the
Pyramids. It was in this Venerable Brotherhood that Jesus, The Master received His educa­
tion and preparation for His life’s work. History shows that Jesus, when still a young man,
suddenly and mysteriously disappeared, and for eighteen long years He remained in
absolute seclusion and obscurity only to reappear as a Master of Occultism. His Spiritual
development and Personal Mastership startled the Multitudes, the Scribes, and the Phari­
sees. Jesus was a Master. He faced a sordid, narrow-minded, and materialistic world of
blind adherents to conventional ideas. It was a Pharisiacal world that Jesus, the Jewish
Devotee from Bethlehem to Palestine, gazed upon with His God-like, keen, Spiritual eyes.
He had to reckon with an Ancient sect, who paid excessive regard to tradition and to
external Ceremonies more than to the True Spiritual power, which lies within the human
soul. Jesus, outside of a few true followers, was surrounded by a lot of formalists or
hypocrites. To these people the gospel of Christ was an unusual occurrence; an inexplicable
fact. To them Jesus was a Marvel; a Prodigy. He made every effort to promote the happi­
ness or social and Spiritual elevation of mankind. He desired and made a great effort, in
fact, He gave up His life to mitigate social Evils. His love lor mankind has no parallel in
the History of the world.
Few men have ever been able to translate the allegory of the Man Jesus. His wonderful
parables still remain an obscure teaching as far as some of our smartest and learned of
today are concerned,
A formal simile were the teachings of Christ. His expressions were a form of com­
parison. He likens one to another by use of express terms which have never been pene­
trated only by an Initiate of the same Secret Order to which Jesus himself belonged. Jesus
became an Initiate of the Venerable Order of Wise Men. The Wise Men came from the East
to Jerusalem. That is, they came from the Oriente; the Far East, which holds the records of
a Great School of the Venerable Masters: The Venerable Brotherhood to which Jesus
belonged.
If our University men of today, and our religious teachers are as smart as they claim
to be, WHY DO THEY NOT TRANSLATE AND EXPLAIN THE ALLEGORICAL TEACHINGS
OF THIS GREAT INITIATE. They do not, and can not. because they do not understand the
hidden rudiments or principles of the Secret and Sacred Order to which the Master Jesus
belonged. Jesus went to a school which was Venerable with Age before the Pyramids. Jesus
was the only man that ever taught a TRUE SPIRITUAL PHILOSOPHY. His superior
knowledge had been given to Him by the Great Masters of an Ancient Spiritual School,
which taught the Natural Laws of Life and Nature. The Initiates of this Great Parent School
are taught how to reach the exalted goal of True Spiritual Development and Personal
Mastership, so that they can transmute their principles into a living personal consciousness
and soul power until they can—of their own free will and accord—experience and demon­
strate the Continuity of Life in another world, different from this; because it is Spiritual.
No doubt, the above will startle many who read here. However, enough has been stated
to show the significant link in the chain of facts which bound the Master Jesus to an Ancient
Occult School in the Far East, of which He was a member. Those who are concerned to
quibble or equivocate need only refer to any true history of the Life of Jesus.
Many are guilty of shuffling or evasion of the point or question.
Of course, those who care can continue to try and suppress facts regarding the Initia­
tion, Teachings. Life and Death of Jesus, who, without any doubt, whatsoever, was, and
is, and ever will be the world’s greatest moral Teacher.
His Doctrine is that Spiritual exaltation is attained by self-abnegation, and withdraw­
ing the soul from outward activities and fixing it upon impassive religious contemplation
of an Universal and Immanent God inherent within the souls of all men. An universal God
which is manifested in all things; within the soul of all living beings; manifested in the bud
of the rose: personified in the eye and soul of all animated beings. Jesus said. "Seek Ye the
Kingdom of God within you.” He said: “I am the Son of God.” This was an allegorical
expression, meaning that all men are the Sons of an universal indwelling God. In other
words, God is manifested in the souls of all men, and all things. Even in the fish in the sea,
and the animals that rove the forest the same as branches are part of a great tree. The God
of Jesus was not a personal God. He did not believe in a man-made God. The Venerable
School of "Wise Men,” of which He was an Initiate, were not so foolish. They were wise.
Wise enough to cloak their knowledge in allegory. Everything that Christ said had an
inner meaning. He spoke in parables. His parables, as stated above, have never been
translated. To interpret. To unfold and explain the meaning of the expressions of tills Great
Initiate. To illustrate. To translate orally the secret doctrine of Jesus one must be
designed or fitted to interpret His great and constructive knowledge of life as it is lived,
in accordance with the immutable laws of Nature. To cite, to read, or preach the sayings
of Christ is of no benefit to anyone. The unlearned preacher is wearisome and reminds
one of an expression from Shakespeare:
"Tedious as a twice-told tale
Vexing the ears of a drowsy man.”
"Duller than a great thaw.
Dry as a remainder biscuit after a voyage.”
No public speaker has ever been able to do Jesus justice, that is, explain the inner and
the allegorical meaning of His grand expressions. The average minister’s best can be com­
pared with Christ's common, but Christ’s best rises above the minister's best, like a sheen-
domed temple above the beggar’s hut. Christ gave to a cold, unsympathetic, critical world
a beautiful Spiritual Esoteric Doctrine, which during His time, and life, and even today, is
taught and known only by an inner circle of disciples. The gospel of Christ can only be
utilized in a personal way by those who become enlightened, as esoteric knowledge very
likely, will, for a long time, be confined to a select circle.
Christ preached His gospel; but in the gospel of Christ there is a deadly parallel. It
has an inner meaning which few understand. In all of His expressions there is but a
hint, a prophesy, of the destiny of mankind. Were the expressions of Christ properly trans­
lated and lived up to they would revolutionize the world.
Some people imagine they are preachers; but their efforts only increases the wonder,
and adds a useless burden to credulity.
Jesus left the wondrous children of His soul on the broken doorstep of materialism.
Jesus Christ was the greatest moral Teacher of our world. He has left to us ths richest
legacy of all the dead—the Spiritual treasures of the rarest soul that ever lived and loved
bls fellowmen. (Continued on Next Page)
3? THE de LAURENCE COMPANY
It would not be possible to estimate what we owe Jesus. Take from our world what He
gave, and Life, to the thoughtful man, would become an unmeaning waste.
No person, minister, king, queen, or emperor can ever honor Christ, but Christ has
honored all men.
Ignorant people are apt to overrate the value of men who occupy an office.
You will remember that Christ was very personal in his address. Is there anything
more intense than these words. “Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if
the blind lead the blind, both shall into the ditch.” (Matt. 15:14.)
Is there an intellectual man in the world who will not agree with the above?
Christ knew the tides and currents of universal life. He knew, as every man will know
some time in his life, that Nature cares neither for smiles nor tears, for Life nor Death, and
that the Sun shines as gladly on coffins as on cradles.
In many of the expressions of Christ there is a kind of scorn—a hidden meaning that
could not in His day and time have safely been expressed. And that is the reason why many
of His sublime declarations were clothed in allegory.

THE GREAT KEY OF SOLOMON
Translated From An Ancient Manuscript
SPECIAL STATEMENT. Translation From An Ancient Manuscript In The British
Museum. A Precise Exposition Of King Solomon’s Secret Procedure: Its Mysteries and
Magic Rites. By Solomon, The “Wise Man.” Solomon, Son Of David And Bathsheba, (1033-
975 B. C.); King of Israel; noted for his Wisdom and deep Knowledge of Occult Forces:
author of the "Key Of Solomon.” Solomon was a King; the son of a King the wise son
of a wise father; a righteous man’s righteous child. David, the father of Solomon, reigned
for forty years, as it is written. “And the days that David governed Israel were forty years."
Of Solomon, it is written, “And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.”
Solomon was born in the year 2912 B. C., and reigned over Israel forty years. Four hundred
and thirty-three years elapsed between the date of Solomon’s reign and that of the Temple’s
destruction. Solomon wrote five books: "Proverbs,” “Ecclesiastes," “The Song of Solo­
mon,” “The Greater Key of Solomon,” and “The Lesser Key Of Solomon.”
“THE GREATER KEY OF SOLOMON” contains original Plates, Seals, Pentacles,
Charms and Talismans from Ancient Manuscripts. There is nothing in Occult Literature
which can suffer comparison with the Historical Manuscripts of "Solomon, The Son Of
David, King of Israel.” It gives Instructions for the Operation of Talismanic and Cere­
monial Magic, as well as for performing various Evocations. Besides Seals, Sigils, and
Magical Diagrams, nearly fifty Pentacles or Talismans are given in the Plates. (See Order
No. 12 next page.)
A high-grade and one of the most important works on the subject of both Black and
White Magic as well as Talismanic Magic, is that famous book known as "THE GREATER
KEY OU SOLOMON.” It is.at the. head of all, and within certain limits, the source of all
Magical Instruction. It teaches everything regarding Talismans and the Invocation of
Spirits.

Every Occult student, who has been fortunate enough to own a copy of this Wonderful
Book, which deals exclusively with White Magic, Black Magic, and Talismans, knows that
it is a Rare and Valuable Publication.
Until de Laurence imported and published his edition, “THE GREATER KEY OF
SOLOMON” was very costly, and therefore not easy to obtain.
“THE GREATER KEY OF SOLOMON” was well-known to Occult students in Latin,
in French, in Italian, and also in German; it having belonged to the Sixteenth Century.
An old copy is still preserved in the British Museum at London, and it was from this copy
that The de Laurence Edition has been translated at a great cost, de Laurence has made
it possible to now obtain this book at a low cost. There are many book dealers who, were
they in de Laurence’s place, would charge $25.'OO a copy for it. Our Price, at his sugges­
tion, is ONLY ?6.00; Foreign £1 12s. As stated above, it was first translated and edited
from an Ancient Manuscript in the British Museum. It was first literally translated from
the Hebrew text into French. It was also translated from Hebrew Into Italian and
German. Strange to relate, those copies of "THE GREATER KEY OF SOLOMON” which
were translated from the Ancient Hebrew into French, into Italian and into German have
all disappeared and no copies are obtainable at any price outside of the edition now pub­
lished by de Laurence, and, as stated above, rvere he not so liberal and generous, a large
price would be asked for “THE GREATER KEY OF SOLOMON” as well as “THE LESSER
KEY OF SOLOMON,” for they cannot be obtained anywhere else. It is well known that
de Laurence desires to spend his life helping humanity and in publishing and selling, at
a low price, every book that will be a help to the student.
de Laurence has also at great cost had "THE GREATER KEY OF SOLOMON” trans­
lated into Arabic. Copies of the Arabic Edition sell for ONLY $25.00; Foreign £6. (See
Order No. 13 below.)
“THE LESSER KEY OF SOLOMON” is also a very Wonderful book, and has sold in
Europe for as high as $15.00 a copy. The de Laurence Company now sells “THE LESSER

Follow My Lessons With Precision
By de Laurence
Obviously, however, in order to reach his determination, the student, as taught in this
Grand Book, must arm himself with intrepidity and prudence, and this is the first counsel
of his Spirit guides to the sanctum Regnum of Goetia.
“O men! O impotent mortals!” cries the author of this “Grand Volume,” “tremble at
your own temerity when you blindly aspire to the possession of a science so profound as
that taught in ‘The Book Of Black Magic And Of Pacts.’ Lift up your minds beyond your
limited sphere, and learn of me that before you undertake anything it is necessary that you
should become firm and immovable, besides being scrupulously attentive in the exact
observation, step by step, of all things whatsoever that I shall tell you, without which pre­
cautions every Spirit operation will tunn to your disadvantage, confusion, and total destruc­
tion; while, on the contrary, by following my Lessons with precision, you will rise from
your meanness and poverty, achieving a complete success in all your enterprises. Arm
yourselves, therefore, with intrepidity, prudence, wisdom, and virtue, as qualifications for
this grand and illimitable work, in which I have passed many years, toiling night and day
for the attainment of success in this sublime object.”
In Mysticism and Magic, as in everything else, be it Magical Ceremonies, Invocations, or
Bewitchments, the Spiritual intention of the Operation must first be determined. The next
step is the acquisition of the mental attitude requisite and appropriae for work of this kind.
It is not hard to picture the average student in the traditional state of the would be Master
of Occultism and Magic. Many have failed, and many shall continue to fail; because they
do not pay strict attention to the instructions given. Too many men today are poor, envi­
ous, ambitious, fearful, avaricious, and grasping, but still have no particular capacity for
developing their Spiritual and Occult powers, and all of this avails them nothing.
Others unable to earn money seek after hidden treasures, and haunt those places, up
and down, and through the country fields which are believed to contain hidden treasures.
Let it be understood that the earth will not yield up her buried treasures, for the Gnomes
and the Earth-Spirits, the Alastors and the Spirits of the Solitudes, always stand guard over
the money, the secrets of dead misers, and the treasures which have been buried, especially
when the human ghost or sniritual body of the miser has ceased to remain in the neighbor­
hood where the treasure has been buried. To compel the Earth-Spirits, who are the guar­
dians of buried treasures, to disclose the very spot where a treasure may be buried, one
must understand certain Secret Things which are taught only in those books which deal
with Black Magic and Pacts.
Many students of Occultism and Spiritualism are very anxious to obtain the Key, or to
get some hint of the Modus Operand! of Mysticism. Some have only an inference from a
hypothetical premise. Their information is so small that they are not able to arrive at the
truthfulness of the subject.

A suggestion right here might be helpful. Converge the center of your consciousness
inwardly. Interior focalization of your mind is helpful. Adjust your mind inwardly with
a hope and a belief that you will obtain distinct vision of things of the Spiritual World.
Get in the habit of focusing your attention on the Spiritual World instead of the Material
World. Concentrate not on the material things around you; forget them, for the more you
become unconscious of the Material World the more you become conscious of the Spiritual
World. Learn to develop your Inner or Spiritual sight. Every man has two sights, that is,
an outward or Material Sight and an inward or Spiritual Sight.
Spiritual Rhythm And Harmony
By de Laurence
Do you fully appreciate the Spiritual Rhythm and Harmony of today—the magnificent
symphony of Ancient Occultism? Have you learned to listen with your eyes as well as your
ears—with your brain as well as your sense? True enough, this demands concentration to
a degree, but you must learn to do so if you hope to be attuned to this gigantic expression
of introspection.
Its tone motif is progress, played in the perfect harmony of Spiritual co-operation. Its
tempo—rapid but rhythmical—is the perfect co-ordination of Man’s Soul Powers and the
Occult Forces of Nature.
Never has a maestro conceived a more brilliant tonal poem, with such colossal concep­
tion, than Occultism offers its devotees. Are you prepared to play your part as well as
listen? Just to be content to listen and look on is not nearly enough if you wish to be
shoulder to shoulder with your fellow Spirit Friends in the symphony of success.
You must learn to play your part perfectly. The false notes of doubt are discordant,
they have no part in the perfect ensemble. The discordant notes, which bespeak lack of
preparation and misunderstanding of what you are to accomplish, will not be tolerated.
A full realization of the end in view, the ideal which the maestro has symbolized, is neces­
sary if you are to interpret Nature’s Hidden Forces correctly.
Ambition must be coupled with intelligent understanding; you must serve well and
faithfully if you hope to play an active part in the symphony of Occultism and Spiritualism.
Turn your own eyes Inward—take full stock of yourself, your ability and ideals. Listen
carefully to those who have failed and benefit by their mistakes. Mistakes and false notes
can be forgiven and are not fatal unless you make the unforgivable mistake of making
them again. Learn by your experiences—so that the false notes will not occur too often.
In your own way you also have a part to play. You too, have made your mistakes—but
■ ou should profit by them. If you do this you will play a better, a larger, and a more perfect
part in the symphony of Human progress. Why not benefit by your experiences? As a
teacher of Occultism and Magic I shall always endeavor to point out with the utmost sln-
e ity how a student’s work can be bettered and made more in tune with the Venerable Mins­
ters of Ancient Occultism so that they can be your partners toward the ideal of a perfect
Spiritual harmony, of a more beautiful rendition of the Occult symphony in the rhythm
of Esoteric teaching.
The Modus Operandi Of Mysticism
Introspection is the last word in the first paragraph of this article, and I feel that more
should be told regarding this state or condition of mind. Not many know mental intro-
sentient and that is the reason why very few are capable of inward or self-conscious per­
ception of feeling. In the Orient, and the Far East, the neophyte is taught to cultivate
and develop a true- state of introspection. He must practice introspection or self-examina­
tion. This act of observing and analyzing one’s own thoughts and feelings, or the contents of
their inward consciousness is helpful and interesting; because it is a real psychological study
of one’s self. Introspection w’hich starts with a purpose of finding out one’s own absurdities
is always helpful.
To study the phenomena of one’s mental life, by bringing about a state of introspection
is always helpful especially if one wishes to make a psychical investigation into any matter.
Looking within, that is, practicing introspection, is also a great help to those who
desire to develop their Spiritual or Clairvoyant sight. As stated, not many, outside of the
Orient, have made a deep study of introspection, and many a dull boy or girl is supposed to
be stupid when they are simply introspective.
Introversion is the act of turning or directing one’s mind inward. The deeper phases of
introspection are necessary if one wishes to advance in Mysticism. Introspective methods
and practices, that is, turning the mind inwardly, is taught in the Orient only to those cap­
able of introversion.
Keen intuition is quick preception of truth without conscious attention to reason­
ing, and might be termed instinctive knowledge. Woman’s intuition is superior to man’s.
Envisagement
Those who wish to develop their Mental or Occult powers should understand that
interior introspection of the mind and intuition, gives an immediate knowledge, or envisage­
ment, of an object, truth, or principle, whether of a psychical, physical, rational, artistic, or
ethical nature; a conception derived by analogy from the act and result of clear and con­
centrated Mental or Spiritual vision.
In scholastic philosophy intuition was employed—'notably by St. Anselm—to distinguish
the knowledge of finite things from a knowledge of God which comes, not by speculation
or through the senses, but by a rational and immediate or “face-to-face” presentation.
Knowledge by intuition is distinguished from discursive knowledge, or knowledge about,
since it comes by mere inspection of the data; as, with Locke, the simpler propositions of
mathematics, and with J. S. Mill, the truths which form the original premises of all argu­
ment. With Kant, an intuition was either empirical, or an object of sense considered as
immediately known; or else pure, as consisting of the priori representation of space and
time. Fichte, Schelling, and others have employed the term to denote the immediate
knowledge of the Absolute as opposed to a merely negative conception. In somewhat simi­
lar way, Mysticism claims to have an intuition of God. Recently, intuition is more com­
monly applied to such truths as appear, when we look into them, or intuit their nature,
to carry their evidence in themsel\* s and not to depend on other truths for their claim to
acceptance.

~ »■»' AND
THE PRETENDER OF YOUNG AMERICA.
By L. W. de Laurence.
All genuine Spiritualistic Phenomena are caused by disembodied human souls. There
is, however, a certain kind of physical phenomena that is produced by occult forces of
nature, such as happen through a few mediums, and are consciously employed by the
Adepts of India and Egypt.
The extent to which "objective change," that is, the moving of certain objects by these
occult forces, of nature, deserve a careful and serious investigation by science; especially
now that a number of respected authorities have testified that in many cases the hypothesis
of fraud does not hold. No doubt, there are of course in India professed “conjurers”
who can perform cleverer tricks than all the American and English “John Kings” together.
Robert Houdin unquestionably could, but this did not prevent his laughing outright in the
face of the academicians, when they desired him to assert in the London newspapers
that he could make a table move, or rap answers to questions without contact of hands,
unless the table was a prepared one. The fact alone, that a now notorious London juggler
refused to accept a challenge for fT.ooo ($5,000.00) offered him by Mr. Algernon Joy, to
produce such spiritual manifestations as are usually obtained through spirit mediums,
unless he was left unbound and free from the hands of a committee, negatives his expose
of the occult phenomena. Clever as he may be. I defy and challenge him to reproduce,
under the same conditions, the “phenomena” exhibited even by a common Hindu neophyte.
For instance, the spot to be chosen by the investigators at the moment of the performance,
and the neophyte to know nothing of the choice; the experiment to be made in broad day­
light, without the least preparations for it; without any confederate but a boy absolutely
naked, and the Hindu to be in a condition of semi-nudity. After that, I should select
out of a variety of three kind of occult phenomena that were recently exhibited to some
gentlemen belonging to the suite of the Prince of Wales:
First. To transform a rupee—firmly clasped in the hand of a sceptic—into a living
cobra, the bite of which would prove fatal, as an examination of its fangs would show.
Second. To cause a seed chosen at random by the spectators, and planted in the first
semblance of a flower-pot, furnished by the same sceptic, to grow, mature, and bear fruit
in less than a quarter of an hour.
Third. To stretch himself on three swords, stuck perpendicularly in the ground at
their hilts, the sharp points upward; after that, to have removed first one of the swords,
then the other, and, after an interval of a few seconds, the last one, the Hindu remaining,
finally, lying on nothing—in the air, miraculously suspended at about one yard from the
ground.' When any prestidigitator, to begin with Houdin and end with the last cheap
trickster and magician, which performs on the American stage, who has secured gratuitous
advertisement by attacking Spiritualism and Occultism, does the same, then—but only then
—‘will I train myself to believe that mankind has been evolved out of the hind-toe of Mr.
Huxley’s Eocene Orohippus.
I assert again, in full confidence, that there does not exist a professional conjurer,
who does tricks and stage illusions, either of the North, South or West, who can compete
with anything approaching success, with these untutored, naked neophytes of the East.
These disciples, of the real occult forces of nature, require no Egyptian Hall for their
performances, nor any preparation or rehearsals; but are ever ready, at a moment’s
notice, to evoke to their help the hidden “occult powers,” of nature, which, for European
and American prestidigitators, such as Herrmann, Robert Houdin, W. J. Hiller, as well
as for such sensational surface writers as H. R. Evans, author of “Hours With the Ghosts,”
and pseudo scientists, are a closed book. Verily, as Elihu puts it, “great men are not always
wise; neither do the aged understand judgment.”* To repeat the remark of the English
divine, Dr. Henry More, I may well say: . . . “indeed, if there were any modesty left
in mankind, the histories of the Bible might abundantly assure men of the existence of
angels and spirits.” The same eminent man adds, “I look upon it as a special piece of
Providence that . . . fresh examples of spiritualistic phenomena may awaken our
benumbed and lethargic minds into an assurance that there are other intelligent beings
besides those that are clothed in heavy earth or clay . . . for this evidence, showing
that there are spirits, will necessarily open a door to the belief that there are good and bad
ones, and lastly, that there is a spirit life beyond the grave.” The instance above given
carries a moral with it, not only to scientists, but theologians. Men who have made their
marks in the pulpit and in professors’ chairs, are continually showing the lay public that
they really know so little of psychology, as to take up with any plausible schemer who
comes their way, and so make themselves ridiculous in the eyes of the thoughtful student.
Public opinion upon this subject has been manufactured by jugglers and self-styled savants,
unworthy of respectful consideration. . .
The development of psychology has been retarded far more by the ridicule of this

class of cheap pretenders, than by the inherent difficulties of its study. The empty laugh
of the scientific nursling or of the fools of fashion, has done more to keep man ignorant
of his imperial soul powers, than the obscurities, the obstacles, and the dangers that cluster
about the subjests. This is especially the case with spiritualistic phenomena and occultism.
That their investigation has been so largely confined to incapables, is due to the fact that
men of science, who might and would have studied them, have been frightened off by
the boasted exposures, the paltry jokes, and the impertinent clamor of those who are not
worthy to tie their shoes. There are moral cowards even in the pulpit and university
chairs. The inherent vitality of modern spiritualism is proven in its survival of the neglect
of the scientific body, and of the obstreperous boasting of its pretended exposers. If
we begin with the contemptuous sneers of the patriarchs of science, such as Farady and
Brewster, and end with the professional (?) exposes of the successful mimicker of the
phenomena, H. R. Evans, author of the so-called “Hours With the Ghosts,” you will not
find them furnishing one single, well-established argument against the occurrence of spir­
itual manifestations.
But the most inveterate, uncompromising enemies of Spiritualism and true Occultism
are a class very fortunately composed of but few members, who, nevertheless, declaim
the louder and assert their views with a clamorousness worthy of a better cause. These
are the pretenders to science of young America—a mongrel class of pseudo-philosophers,
mentioned at the opening of this chapter, with sometimes no better right to be regarded
as scholars than the possession of an electrical machine, or the delivery of a peurile lecture
on insanity and mediomania can give. Such men are—if you believe them—profound
thinkers and physiologists; there is none of your metaphysical nonsense about them; they
are Positivists—the mental sucklings of Auguste Comte, whose bosoms swell at the
thought of plucking deluded humanity from the dark abyss of superstition, and rebuilding
the cosmos on improved principles. Irascible psychophobists, no more cutting insult can
be offered them than to suggest that they may be endowed with immortal spirits. To hear
them, one would fancy that there can be no other souls in men and women than “scientific”
or “unscientific souls”; whatever that kind of soul may be.
Some thirty or forty years ago, in France, Auguste Comte—a pupil of the Ecole Poly­
technique, who had remained for years at that establishment as a repetiteur of Transcendent
Analysis and Rationalistic Mechanics—awoke one fine morning with the very irrational
idea of becoming a prophet. In America, prophets can be met with at every street-corner;
in Europe, they are as rare as black swans. But France is the land of novelties. Auguste
Comte became a prophet; and so infectious is fashion, sometimes, that even in sober
England he was considered, for a certain time, the Newton of the nineteenth century.
The epidemic extended, and, for the time being, it spread like wildfire over Germany,
England, and America. It found dupes in France, but the excitement did not last long with
thebe, The prophet needed money: the converts were unwilling to furnish it. The fever
of admiration for a religion without immortality cooled off as quickly as it had come on;
of all the enthusiastic apostles of the prophet, there remained but one worthy any atten­
tion. It was the famous philologist Littre, a member of the French Institute, and a
would-be members of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, but whom the archbishop of
Orleans maliciously prevented from becoming one of the“Immortals.”*
The philosopher-mathematician—the high-priest of the “religion of the future”—
taught his doctrine as do all his brother-prophets of our modern days. He deified “woman,”
and furnished her with an altar; but the goddess had to pay for its use. The rationalists
had laughed at the mental aberration of Fourier; they had laughed at the St. Simonists;
and their scorn for Spiritualism knew no bounds. The same rationalists and materialists
were caught, like so many empty-headed sparrows, by the bird-lime of the new prophet’s
rhetoric. A longing for some kind of divinity, a craving for the “unknown,” is a feeling
congenital in man; hence the worst atheists seem not to be exempt from it. Deceived
by the outward brilliancy of this ignus fatuus, the disciples followed it until they found
themselves floundering in a bottomless morass.
Covering themselves with the mask of a pretended erudition, the Positivists of Eng­
land and America organized themselves into clubs and committees with the design of
uprooting Spiritualism, while pretending to impartially investigate it.
Too timid to openly challenge the churches of the Christian doctrine, they endeavor
to san that upon which all religion is based—man’s faith in the God, within his own soul,
and his own immortality. Their policy is to ridicule that which affords an unusual basis
for such a faith—phenomenal Spiritualism. Attacking it at its weakest side, they make
the most of its lack of an inductive method, and of the exaggerations that are to be found
in the. transcendental doctrines of its propagandists. Taking advantage of its unpopularity,
and displaying a courage as furious and out of place as that of the errant knight of La
Mancha, they claim recognition as philanthropists and benefactors who would crush out a
monstrous superstition,

Let us see in what degree Comte’s boasted religion of the future is superior to Spir­
itualism, and how much less likely its advocates are to need the refuge of those lunatic
asylums which they officiously i ecommend for the mediums whom they have been so
solicitous about. Before beginning, let me call attention to the fact that three-fourths of
the disgraceful features exhibited in modern Spiritualism are directly traceable to the
materialistic adventurers pretending to be spiritualists. Comte- has fulsomely depicted the
“artificially-fecundated” woman of the future. She is but an elder sister to the Cyprian
ideal of the free lovers. The immunity against the future offered by the teachings of his
moon-struck converts, has inoculated some pseudo-spiritualists to such an extent as to
lead them to form communistic associations. None, however, have proved long-lived.
Their leading feature being generally a materialistic animalism, gilded over with a thin
leaf of base-metal philosophy and tricked out with a combination of hard Greek names,
the communities could not prove anything else than failures.
Plato, in the fifth book of the Republic, suggests a method for improving the human
race by the elimination of the unhealthy or deformed individuals, and by coupling the
better specimens of both sexes. It was not to be expected that the “genius of our cen­
tury,” or even were he a prophet, would squeeze out of his brain anything entirely new.
Comte was a mathematician. Cleverly combining several old utopias, he colored the
whole, and, improving on Plato’s idea, materialized it, and presented the world with the
greatest monstrosity that ever emanated from a human mind.
I beg the reader to keep in view, that I do not attack Comte as a philosopher, but as
a professed reformer. In the irremediable darkness of his political, philosophical and reli­
gious views, we often meet with isolated observations and remarks in which profound
logic and judiciousness of thought rival the brilliancy of their interpretation. But then,
these dazzle you like flashes of lightning on a gloomy night, to leave you, the next moment
more in the dark than ever. If condensed and repunctuated, his several works might
produce, on the whole, a volume of very original aphorisms, giving a very clear and really
clever definition of most of our social evils: but it would be vain to seek, either through
the tedious circumlocution of the six volumes of his Course de Philosophic Positive, or in
that parody on priesthood, in the form of a dialogue—The Catechism of the Religion of
Positivism—any idea suggestive of even provisional remedies for such evils.
PARACELSUS THE GREAT
BY L. W. de LAURENCE.
One of the truest things ever said by a man of science is the remark made by Pro­
fessor Cooke in his New Chemistry:—“The history of Science shows that the age must be
prepared before scientific truths can take root and grow. The barren premonitions of
science have been barren because these seeds of truth fell upon unfruitful soil; and, as
soon as the fulness of the time has come, the seed has taken root and the fruit has ripened
. . . every student is surprised to find how very little is the share of new truth which
even the greatest genius has added to the previous stock.”
The revolution through which chemistry has recently passed, is well calculated to
concentrate the attention of chemists upon this fact; and it would not be strange, if, in
less time than it has required to effect it, the claims of great alchemists, such as Paracelsus,
would be examined with impartiality, and studied from a rational point of view. To bridge
over the narrow gulf which now separates the new chemistry from old alchemy, is little,
if any harder than what they have done in going from dualism to the law of Avogadro.
As Ampere served to introduce Avogadro to our contemporary chemists, so the
writer
* will perhaps one day be found to have paved the way for the just appreciation of
Paracelsus. It was more than fifty years before molecules were accepted as units of
chemical calculations; it may require less than half that time to cause the superlative
merits of the Swiss mystic! to be acknowledged. The warning paragraph about healing
mediums, which will be found elsewhere, has been written by one who had read his works.
The reader should understand that the magnet is that spirit of life in man which the
infected seeks, as both unite themselves with chaos from without. And thus the healthy
are infected by the unhealthy through magnetic attraction.
* de Laurence, + Paracelsus.
The primal causes of the diseases afflicting mankind: the secret relations between
physiology and psychology, vainly tortured by men of modern science for some clew to
base their speculations upon; the specifics and remedies for every ailment of the human
body—all are described and accounted for in Paracelsus’ voluminous work, now published
in Two Volumes, and listed in our catalog at a very low price. Electro-magnetism, the
so-called discovery of Professor Oersted, had- been used by Paracelsus three centuries
before. This may be demonstrated by examining critically his mode of curing disease.

Upon his achievements in chemistry there is no need to enlarge, for it is admitted by
fair and unprejudiced writers that he was one of the greatest chemists of his time.*
Brierre de Boismont terms Paracelsus a “genius” and agrees with Deleuze that he
created a new epoch in the history of occult medicine. The secret of his successful and,
as they were called, magic cures lies in his sovereign contempt for the so-called learned
“authorities” of his age. “Seeking for truth,” says Paracelsus, “I considered with my­
self that if there were no teachers of medicine in this world, how would I set to learn
the art? No otherwise than in the great open book of nature, written with the finger of
Divine Wisdom. ... I am accused and denounced for not having entered in at the
right door of art. But which is the right one? Galen, Avicenna, Mesue, Rhasis, or honest
nature. I believe, the last. Through this door I entered, and the light of nature, and no
apothecary’s lamp directed me on my way.”
This utter scorn for established laws and scientific formulas, this aspiration of mortal
clay to commingle with the spirit of nature, and look to it alone for health, and help, and
the light of truth, was the cause of the inveterate hatred shown by the contemporary
pigmies to the fire-philosopher and alchemist. No wonder that he was accused of char­
latanry. Of this charge, Hemmann boldly and fearlessly exonerates him, and proves that
the foul accusation proceeded from “Oporinus, who lived with him some time in order to
learn his occult secrets, but his object was defeated; hence, the evil reports.” He was
founder of the School of Animal Magnetism and the discoverer of the occult properties
of the magnet. He was branded by his age as a sorcerer, because the cures he made were
marvellous. Three centuries later, Baron Du Potet was also accused of sorcery ana
domonolatry by the Church of Rome, and of charlatanry by the academicians of Europe.
As the fire-philosophers say, it is not the chemist who will condescend to look upon the
“living fire” otherwise than his colleagues do. “Thou hast forgotten what thy fathers
taught thee about it—or rather, thou hast never known ... it is too loud for thee 1”
A work upon magico-spiritual philosophy and occult science would be incomplete with­
out a particular notice of the history of animal magnetism, as it stands since Paracelsus
staggered with it the schoolmen of the latter half of the sixteenth century.
We will observe briefly its appearance in Paris when imported from Germany by
Anton Mesmer. Let us peruse with care and caution the old papers now mouldering in
the Academy of Sciences of that capital, for there shall we find that, after having re­
jected in its turn every discovery that was ever made since Galileo, the Immortals capped
the climax by turning their backs upon magnetism and mesmerism. They voluntarily
shut the doors before themselves, the doors which led to those greatest occult mysterks
of nature, which lie hid in the dark regions of the psychical as well as the physical world.
The great universal solvent, the Alkahest, was within their reach—they passed it by; and
now, after nearly a hundred years have elapsed, we read the following confession:
“Still it is true, that beyond the limits of direct observation, our science (chemistry)
is not infallible, and our theories and systems, although they may all contain a kernel of
truth, undergo frequent changes, and are often revolutionized.”!
To assert so dogmatically that mesmerism, hypnotism and animal magnetism are but
hallucinations, implies that it can be proved. But where are these proofs, which alone
ought to have authority in science? Thousands of times the chance was given to the
academicians to assure themselves of the truth; but, they have invariably declined.
Vainly do hypnotic operators and healer invoke the testimony of the deaf, the lame, the
diseased, the dying, who were cured or restored to life by simple manipulations and the
apostolic “laying on of hands.” “Coincidence” is the usual reply, when the fact is too
evident to be absolutely denied; “will-o’-the-wisp,” “exaggeration,” “quackery,” are favorite
expressions, with our but too materialistic doctors and numerous doubting Thomases.
Many call the writer the greatest living healer; be this true or not true, I have performed
more instantaneous cures than many a famous physician of New York City has had
patients in all his life. _ A disciple of mine, now a great Mystic, has had a like
success in France. Again, must we consider the accumulated testimony of the last forty
years upon this subject to be all illusion, confederacy with clever charlatans, and lunacy?
Even to breathe such a stupendous fallacy would be equivalent to a self-accusation of
lunacy.
Notwithstanding the recent sentence of Leymarie, the scoffs of the sceptics, and of a
vast majority of physicians and scientists, the unpopularity of the subject, and, above all,
the indefatigable persecutions of the Roman Catholic • clergy, fighting in mesmerism
woman’s traditional enemy, so evident and unconquerable is the truth of its phenomena
that even the French magistrate was forced tacitly, though very reluctantly, to admit the
same. The famous clairvoyante, Madame Roger, was charged with obtaining money
under false pretences, in company with her mesmerist, Dr. Fortin. When she was
arraigned before the Tribunal Correctionnel of the Seine her witness was iBaron Du Potet,
the grand master of mesmerism in France for the last fifty years; her advocate, (lawyer)

the no less famous Jules Favre. Truth for once triumphed—the accusation was aban­
doned. Was it the extraordinary eloquence of the orator, or bare facts incontrovertible
and unimpeachable that won the day? But Leymarie, the editor of the Revue Spirite,
had also facts in his favor; and, moreover, the evidence of over a hundred respectable
witnesses, among whom were the first names of Europe. To this there is but one answer—•
the magistrates dared not question the facts of mesmerism. Spirit-photography, spirit-
rapping, writing, moving, talking, and even spirit-materializations can be simulated; there
is hardly a physical phenomenon now in Europe and America but could be imitated—with
apparatus—by a clever juggler. The wonders of mesmerism and subjective phenomena
alone defy tricksters, scepticism, stern science, and dishonest mediums; the cataleptic
state it is impossible to feign. Spiritualists who are anxious to have their truths pro­
claimed and forced on science, cultivate the mesmeric phenomena by learning hypnotism.

and clairaudience; stick pins into any part of the body which the hypnotist may have made
his passes over; thrust needles through the skin below the subject’s eyelids; burn the
flesh and lacerate it with a sharp instrument. “Do not fear!” exclaim Regazzoni and
Du Potet, Teste and Pierrard, Puysegur and Dolgorouky—“a hypnotized or entranced
subject is never hurt!’’* And when all this is performed, invite any popular so-called
wizard of the day who thirsts for puffery, and is, or pretends to be, clever at mimicking
hypnotic and spiritualistic phenomena, to submit his body to the same test It
The famous speech of Jules Favre, made before the French magistrate, in his defense
of Madame Roger, is reported to have lasted an hour and a half, and to have held the
judges and the public spellbound by its eloquence. Those who have heard Jules Favre
believe it most readily; only the statement .embodied in the last sentence of his argument
was unfortunately premature and erroneous at the same time. “We are in the presence
of a phenomenon which science admits without attempting to explain. The public may .
smile at it, but our more illustrious physicians regard it with gravity. Justice can no
longer ignore what science has acknowledged!”
Were this sweeping declaration based upon fact and had mesmerism been impar­
tially investigated by many instead of a few true men of science, more desirous of ques­
tioning nature than mere expediency, the public would never smile. The public is a docile
and pious child, and readily worships the so-called men of science in proportion to the
~ noise they make; and then turns round with a timid look of adulation to see whether
nurse, old Mrs. Public Opinion, is satisfied.
Lactantius, the old Christian father, is said to have remarked that no sceptic in his
days would have dared to maintain before an Adept that the soul did not survive the
body, but died together with it; “for he would refute them on the spot by calling up the
souls of the dead, rendering them visible to the human eyes, and making them foretell
future events.”t So with the magistrate and bench in Madame Rogers’ case. Baron Du
Potet was there and they were afraid to see him mesmerize the somnambulist, and so
force them not only to believe in the phenomenon, but to acknowledge it—which is far
worse.
And now the doctrine of Paracelsus. His incomprehensible, though lively style must
be read like the biblio-rolls of Ezekiel, “within and without." The peril of propounding
heterodox theories was great in those days; the Church was powerful, and sorcerers were
burnt by the dozen. For this reason, we find Paracelsus, Agrippa, and Eugenius Philalethes
as notable for their pious declarations as they were famous for their achievements in
alchemy and art magic. The full views of Paracelsus on the occult properties of the
magnet are explained most fully in his famous writings now published in two Volumes
by Messrs, de Laurence, Scott & Co., and sold for less than half the price asked by Eng­
lish booksellers. He also describes, in these two Volumes, a very powerful and wonderful
tincture, a medicine extracted from the magnet and called Magisterium Magnetis. “Every
peasant sees,” states' Paracelsus, “that a magnet will attract iron, but a wise man must
inquire for himself. ... I have discovered that the magnet, besides this invisible
power, that of attracting iron, possesses another and concealed power.”

JESUS THE MASTER
Accused Of Magic By The Jews.
By L. W. de Laurence
At the beginning of the Gospel according to St. John there is one sentence which, is
never uttered by the Catholic Church except in the bending of the knees; that sentence is:
‘'The Word was made flesh." The plenary revelation of Christianity is comprised therein.
So also elsewhere the Evangelist furnishes the criterion of orthodoxy, which is the con­
fession of Jesus Christ manifested in flesh—that is to say, in visible and human reality.
After emblazoning in his visions the pentacles and hieroglyphs of esoteric.science; after
exhibiting wheels revolving within wheels; after picturing living eyes turning to all the
spheres; after deploying the beating wings of the four mysterious living creatures—Ezekiel,
the most profound Kabalist of the ancient prophets, beholds nothing but a plain strewn with
dry bones. At his word they are covered with flesh, and so is form restored to them. A
pitiful beauty invests these remnants of death, but that beauty is cold and lifeless. Of such
were the doctrines and mythologies of the elder world, when a breath of love descended
upon them from heaven. Then the dead shapes rose up; the wraiths of philosophy gave
place to men of true wisdom; the Word was incarnate and alive; it was no longer the
day of abstractions but one of reality. That faith which is proved by works replaced the
hypotheses which ended is nothing but fables. Magic was transformed into sanctity,
wonders became miracles, the common people—excluded by ancient initiation—were called
to the royalty and priesthood of virtue. Realization is thus of the essence of Christian
religion, and its doctrine gives a body even to the most obvious allegories. The house of
the young man who had great possessions is still shown in Jerusalem, and it might be in
no sense impossible for careful research to discover a lamp which, by a similar tradition,
once belonged to one of the foolish virgins. Such ingenuous credulities are fundamentally
not very dangerous; indeed they prove only the living and realizing power of the Chris­
tian faith. The Jews accused that faith of having materialized belief and idealised earthly
things. In the Doctrine And Ritual Of Transcendental Magic, by Eliphas Levi, there is
recited the scandalous parable of the Sepher Toldos Jeshu, which was invented to support
the accusation. It is related in the Talmud that Jesus ben Sabta, or the son of the divorced
woman, having studied profane mysteries in Egypt, set up a false stone in Israel and led
the people into idolatry. It was acknowledged, notwithstanding that the Jewish priesthood
did wrong when it cursed him with both hands, and it is in this connection that we find in
the Talmud one beautiful precept which is destined hereafter to unite Occultism and Truth:
"Never curse with both hands, so that one of them may always be free to forgive and to
bless." As a fact, the priesthood was guilty of injustice towards that peace-bringing Master
who counseled his disciples to obey the constituted hierarchy. “They are in the seat of
Moses," and the Savior said: “Do therefore that which they tell you but not as they do
themselves." On another occasion he commanded ten lepers to show their persons to the
priests, and they were cured on the road: what touching abnegation in the Divine Worker of
miracles, who thus ascribed to His most deadly enemies the very honor of His miracles.
For the rest, were those who accused Christ of setting up a spurious corner-stone acquainted
themselves with the true one? Had not the Jews in the days of the Pharisees lost the
science of that which is at once the corner-stone, the cubic stone, the philosophical stone—
in a word, the fundamental stone of the Kabalistic Temple, square at the base and triangular
above like the pyramids? By impeaching Jesus as an innovator did they not proclaim that
they had themselves forgotten antiquity? Was not that light which Abraham saw and
rejoiced extinguished for the unfaithful children of Moses, and was it not recovered by
Jesus, the Master, who made it shine with a new splendor? To be quite certain on the
subject, the Gospel and Apocalypse of St. John must be compared with the mysterious
doctrines of the Sepher Yetzirah and Zohar. It will then be realized that Christianity, so
far from being a heresy in Israel, was the true orthodox tradition of Jewry, while it was
the Scribes and Pharisees who were sectarians. Furthermore, Christian orthodoxy is proved
by the consent of the world at large and by the suspension of the sovereign priesthood,
together with the perpetual sacrifice, in Israel—the two indisputable marks of a true
religion. Judaism, without a temple, without a High Priest, and without a sacrifice sur­
vives only as a dissident persuasion; certain persons are still Jews, but the Temple and
Altar are Christian. There is. a beautiful allegorical exposition in the Apocryphal Gospels
of this criterion of certitude in respect of Christianity: its evidence is that of realization.
Some children were amusing themselves by fashioning birds of clay, and among them was
the child Jesus. Each little artist praised his own work, and only Jesus said nothing; but
when he had moulded His birds, He clapped His hands, tellintr them t<-> fly, 3nd they flew.

So did Ancient Occultism show its superiority over modern orthodoxy; the latter will die,
but Occultism will live forever. Considered as the fully realized and vital expression of the
Kabalah—this is to say, of primitive tradition—Christianity is still unknown, and hence that
Kabalistic and prophetic book called the Apocalypse yet remains to be explained, being
incomprehensible without the Kabalistic Keys. The traditional interpretation was long pre­
served by the Johannites, or disciples of St. John; but the Gnostics intervened—to the total
confusion and loss of everything, as will be made clear at a later period.
We read in the Acts of the Apostles that St. Paul at Ephesus collected all the books
which treated of things curious and burnt them in public. The reference is no doubt to
the old Goetic texts, or works of necromancy. The loss is regrettable assuredly, since even
from the memorials of error there may shine some rays of truth, while information may con­
sequently be derived which will prove precious to science. It is a matter of general knowl­
edge that.at the advent of Christ Jesus the Oracles were silenced everywhere, and a voice
went wailing over the sea, crying: “Great Pan is dead.” A pagan writer, who takes excep­
tion to the report, declares on his own part that the Oracles did not cease, but in a little
while no one.was found to consult them. The rectification is valuable, for such an attempted
justification is more conclusive than the pretended calumny. Much the same thing should
be. said concerning the works of wonder, which fell into contempt in the presence of real
miracles. As a fact, if the Occult forces of Nature are obedient to true moral superiority,
miracles become supernatural like the virtues which produce them. This theory detracts
nothing from the power of Magic, while the fact that the Astral Light is obedient to the
spiritual superior Light of the soul signifies in reality for us that the old serpent of allegory
places its vanquished head beneath the foot of the true Disciple of Occultism.
POWER AND INSPIRATION FROM,
The Great Rook Of Magical Art,
Hindu Magic And East Indian Occultism.
A Letter That Is Self-Explanatory.
St. Louis, Mo., Aug. 18th, 1916.

Chicago, III., U. S. A.
Dear Master:
The Great Book Of Magical Art, Hindu Magic And East Indian Occultism, reached
me on Monday, in perfect order. I wish you to know that I am thankful and have great
confidence in it, and that I believe it is going to help me wonderfully in my studies. I also
wish to tell you of my experience on Monday evening when I held this handsome book
close to my breast while sending an earnest prayer to my Creator and, you, my Master.
1 was then sitting in my kitchen, and saw three high spirits all in white. They covered me,
all over my body, with a beautiful blue light which gradually changed into a violet color.
I felt myself being raised up and then felt great warmth and power, which seemed to
come from out of this wonderful book. I have felt its power and shall never part with
it as long as I live. Again thanking you, my Master, for this wonderful Volume and the
inspiration it has already given me, I will close hoping that the Peace of God may be with
you forevermore.
From Your Sincere Disciple.
Publisher’s Note. For reasons that are obvious, we refuse to publish the name of
the writer of the above testimonial. It has become the practice of cheap Professors and
so-called Institutes Of Science And Hypnotism, to copy these names and then send to their
address a lot of cheap colored circulars and other literature professing to teach Hypnotism
and other so-called secret sciences. If their mail order course is anything like the cheap
colored circulars they send out, or is in keeping with their habit of copying other people’s
names, the one who orders it need not be shocked if they find that they have paid a bin
price for a course which has been copied out of a book whose author knew less than these

EVIL SPIRITS
THEIR AGENCY AND POWERS
The Serpent Of The Book Of Genesis
By L. W. de Laurence
Note. The wonderful article, printed below, is by de Laurence who
is better known today all over the world than any living man, owing to his
great achievements in Occultism and Magic which need not be enlarged
upon here. It is admitted by all fair and unprejudiced writers that he is
one of the greatest Adepts and Masters of Occult Laws of his time. The
foremost students of Occultism unite in calling him the one “authority”
of this age upon these subjects. This great Master has learned his art
no otherwise than from the "Open Book Of Nature,” written with the
finger of Divine Wisdom. A study of this article will give the reader
much that is new regarding Evil Spirits. The Publishers.
HE Snake, which plays such a prominent part in the history of the ancients,
was degraded by the absurd interpretation of the Serpent of the “Book Of
Genesis” into a synonym of Satan, the Prince of Darkness, whereas it is the
most concrete image of cosmic symbols. It is the emblem of the healing art
and of the immortality of man. It encircles the images of most of the
sanitary or hygienic gods. The cup of health, in the Egyptian Mysteries,
was entwined by Serpents. As evil can only arise from an extreme in good,
the Serpent, under some other aspects, became typical of matter; which, the more it recedes
from its primal spiritual source, the more it becomes subject to evil. In the oldest Egyptian
cosmogonic allegories, the mundane Snake, when typifying matter, is represented as contained
within a circle; he lies straight across its equator, thus indicating that the universe of
Astral Light, out of which the physical world evolved, while bounding the latter, is itself
bound by the Supreme First Cause. When the Serpent represents eternity and immortality,
it encircles the world, biting its tail, and thus offering no solution of continuity. It then
becomes the Astral Light. The Disciples of the Masters, who belong to The Eastern Order
Of^Sacred Mysteries, teach that the Astral Light is the concentrated primordial element.
Such is the origin of the Serpent, metamorphosed in Christian Ages into Satan. It is the
Od, the Ob and the Aour of Moses and the Kabalists. When in its passive state, when it
acts on those who are unwittingly drawn into its current by Evil Spirits, the Astral Light
is the Ob or Python, Moses was determined to exterminate all those who, sensitive to its
influence, allowed themselves to fall under the easy control of vicious Evil Spirits which
move in the Astral waves like fish in the water; beings who surround every one, and they
are the "dwellers on the threshold.” It becomes the Od, as soon as it is vivified by the
conscious efflux of an immortal soul; for then the Astral currents are acting under the
guidance of either an Adept, a Pure Spirit, or an able Master, who is pure himself and
knows how to direct the blind forces.
The Evil Spirits which move in the Astral Light are the elemental spirits of the
Hindu Kabalist, and are what the Christian Clergery denounce as “devils," the enemies of
mankind. The Adept, who can control the Astral currents, is possessed of divine prophecy,
and has wonderful power over Evil Spirits who are mischievous and deceitful, though some
of them are harmless, but so weak as to have the greatest difficulty in communicating with
mortals whose company they seek incessantly.
It follows from what has been advanced, especially from the statements of the
Scriptures, that while there are different degrees of intellectual capacity amongst Evil
Spirits, yet the powers of all of them, and especially of their prince, and of the highest
orders, must be fearfully great; I say fearfully, because they employ them only to do
mischief. I can by no means adopt the theory, that if we suppose the abilities of Evil
Spirits to have been originally a little superior to those of a highly gifted man and take

AND SPIRITUAL BOO
into the account the way in which they must have been increased by exercise and experience,
and the knowledge they have acquired, my estimate may probably be nearly correct. If the
premises which have been laid down are valid, the lowest order of them must have originally
possessed capacities and powers superior to the greatest of men; while, perhaps, the
united intellect of hundreds of mortals would not equal that of the superior ranks, especially
of their leader. They without doubt possess a degree of vigor of intellect, of power of
acquiring knowledge, of operating on matter, and rendering it subservient to their purposes,
of communicating their ideas to one another, and of influencing the minds of men, and
therefore acting the part of tempters, of which the average person has little conception;
and the actions which are ascribed to them in Scripture, and the hints which it contains
respecting their influence on men, as well as the views which are given of the powers
and actions of good spirits, confirm this statement. And also, we must take into the
account their invisibility to human vision, their immortality, their exhaustless vigor and
power of action (for exhaustless it may be deemed when compared to man’s), their long
and varied experience, gained on earth and in Spirit Life. Then we shall see that they
possess vast advantages over men and women in their spiritual warfare; they must, there­
fore, prove most dangerous enemies.
That these fallen spirits have intercourse with this world, that it a part of their
permitted range, that, as they first tempted man to rebel against good, so they are still, as
far as they have opportunity, enticing him to wickedness of every kind, and that they
have actually succeeded in urging him to the commission of the greatest crimes, are facts
plainly stated in many parts of the Scriptures, and as evidently implied in others. Their
ringleader is called “the evil one of this world,” doubtless because he is the great opponent
of the good of man, and even his rival for the service and worship of truth; "the spirit that
worketh in the children of disobedience" “the devil that deceivcth the nations,” and “the
prince of the powers of the air,” &c. It may be inferred then from the various representations
in the Bible that Evil Spirits are to a great degree, the author of the different systems
of heathenish superstition and idolatry, with all their egregious falsehoods, shocking
caricatures of the truth, abominable impurity, appalling cruelties, and insolent impieties. How
characteristic are these of such beings as Evil Spirits. Lamentably fallen and depraved
as men are, yet considering the natural affections which still work in their breasts, the
restraints under which they are laid, the means that has been used to reclaim them, the enact­
ments and inflictions of human laws, we can scarcely, at times, refrain from exclaiming:
Surely it must require such an influence as is attributed to Evil Spirits, to render men so
atrociously, so insanely, so gratuitously and systematically wicked, and wantonly impious
as they are 1 Surely the depravity of human nature can hardly account for all of men’s
horrid deeds! Evil influences make the human heart deceitful above all things and des­
perately wicked so that out of it proceed evil thoughts, murders, &c., in their most repulsive
forms. Men and women, when under the influence of Evil Spirits, become cruel and depraved,
and it is thus that their souls become productive of wickedness and evil in all its forms.
Evil Spirits, are looked upon by those who are uneducated in Magic and East Indian
Occultism, as being immortal beings and irresponsible. These spirits- are deceitful by
nature and are wicked through intelligent malice. They pass themselves off for some
great person who has died and passed into spirit life. Some of them pretend to be
gods, some appear as Jesus, in fact, there is no lie too filthy or deceitful to pass out of their
mouth. A lying and deceitful man or woman is bad indeed, but a lying spirit is beyond
the conception of mortal man, and it takes an Adept in Magic and Occultism to discover
the secret of their cunning and dark ways. This knowledge is priceless to the student
of Occultism and Magic, and the followers of the Masters who belong to “The Eastern
Order of Sacred Mysteries,” have much to learn of their Occult labors and great achieve­
ments in Astral anthropology. These great men’s zeal and their spiritual explorations are
invaluable. However, those who study my books will obtain much of their rare knowledge.
The existence of such beings as invisible Evil Spirits is readily admitted by all those
who have investigated the subject, and a study of the nature of these vicious beings, who
move and live in the Astral waves, will explain many of the phenomena which has
hitherto been mysterious and inexplicable. Astral currents and waves act on men and
women, which penetrates and saturates them through and through, either directed by the
powerful will of a visible or an unseen spirit which can achieve the same result. Once that
this silent operation is performed, the astral or sidereal phantom of the subject quits its
paralyzed, earthly casket, and, after having roamed in the boundless space, alights at the
threshold of the mysterious “bourne.” For it, the gates of the portal which marks the
entrance to the “silent land” are now but partially ajar; they will fly wide open before
the soul of the entranced somnambulist only on that day when, united with its higher
immortal essence, it will have quitted forever its mortal frame. Until then, the seer or seer­
ess can look into Spirit Life but through a chink; it depends on the acuteness of the
Clairvoyant’s Spiritual Sight to see. more or less through it.

The Eastern Order Of Sacred Mysteries.
That which especially distinguishes the "Brotherhood” of "The Eastern Order of
Sacred Mysteries,” is their marvelous knowledge of the resources of the Astral currents and
the depredations of Evil Spirits. They have gone deep into ancient wisdom, and work not
by modern science, but through that rare knowledge gained by all those who travel the path
and become an Initiated Adept and Mystic.
Every person who investigates real Occultism, is surprised to find how very little
of this ancient wisdom is known by men of today. One of the truest things that I, as a
member of "The Eastern Order of Sacred Mysteries,” have ever written is what has been
stated here regarding vicious Evil Spirits which move and operate in the Astral Light and
direct disturbing congested Astral currents upon those whom they wish to torment or
annoy or bring under the easy control of their Evil Will. These Evil influences are said
to possess an electric hammer and to Be able to wreck the nervous system of any person
whom they care to act upon.
Those great men, who belong to "The Eastern Order of Sacred Mysteries!’ scorn the
established laws and scientific formulas of today. They aspire to operate and control the
Occult laws of Nature, and to look to them alone for health—help and the light of truth.
These Masters have demonstrated that in man lies'a hidden "Occult Force:'
power of man, which thus can operate externally, lies, as it were, hidden in
man. This Magical wisdom and strength thus sleeps, but, by a mere suggest!
into activity, and becomes more living, the more the outer man of flesh and
ideas are repressed. It is thus the soul is brought back to that magical
strength which like a startled sleep had left it. It is not the spirits of he
hell, which the church teaches so much about, which are masters over phy:
but the soul and spirit of man which are concealed in him as the fire is concealei
Astral influences only go forth through the help of the spirit; but this spin
through the whole universe and is in full accord with the human spirits,
who would acquire supernatural and Occult powers, must possess the
unlocks the entrance to these things; for therein lies a secret power concealed, and from
thence come the miraculous powers of Magic. Much has been written of Spiritualism and
the childish phenomena produced by American and European Spiritualists whose work is as
children’s compared to the Adepts who produce magnetic phenomena, even without the
knowledge of the magnetized. The Adept can control a person, may put them completely
into a trance, take them out of it without their knowledge, and at the same time be out
of their sight, at a certain distance even though separated by closed doors or stone walls.
The external senses of the one thus put into a trance, seems to have been completely
suspended, and a duplicate set of senses to have been brought into action. Such are some
of the Occult powers taught in the Temples of India to those who belong to "The Eastern
..Order of Sacred Mysteries!’ and are found worthy of being admitted to the “Brotherhood.”
To the power of an Adept, the most positive person will have to submit. To the sight
of an Adept, the past must yield up its most secret records for his scrutiny; for, the
past and the future is a book which is ever closed to those “who see and do not perceive
with the Spiritual Eye,” on the other hand it is ever opened for one who wills to see it
opened. In this book is kept an unmutilated record of all that was, that is, or ever will
be. The minutest acts of our lives are imprinted on it, and even our thoughts rest
photographed on its eternal Astral Tablets. It is the Book which we see opened by the spirit
in the Revelation "which is the Book of life, and out of which the dead are judged according
to their works.” It is, in short, the MEMORY of Nature written in the ASTRAL LIGHT.
The impression of thoughts, characters, men, and other visions appear in the Astral
waves. In this the things without figure are figured. Thus, ancient as well as modern
wisdom, vaticination and science, agree in corroborating the claims of the Hindu Kabalists.
It is on the indestructible Tablets of the Astral Light that is stamped the impression of
every thought we think, and every act we perform; and that future events—effects of long-
forgotten causes—are already delineated as a vivid picture for the eye of the Adept and
prophet to follow. Memory—the despair of the materialists, the enigma of the psychologist,
and sphinx of science—is to the Initiate of “The Eastern Order Of Sacred Mysteries,”
merely a name to express that power which man unconsciously exerts, and shares with many
of the inferior animals—to look with inner sight into the Astral Light, and there behold the
images of past sensations and incidents. Instead of searching the cerebral ganglia for
micrographs of the living and the dead, of scenes that men visited, of incidents which
men have borne a part, the Adept goes to the vast repository where the records of every
man’s life as well as every pulsation of the visible cosmos are stored up in the Astral
Light for all Eternity.
That flash of memory which is traditionally supposed to show a drowning man every
long-forgotten scene of his mortal life—as the landscape is revealed to the traveller by

intermittent flashes of lightning—is simply the sudden glimpse which the struggling soul
gets into the silent galleries where his history is depicted in imperishable colors.
The well-known fact—one corroborated by the personal experience of nine persons out
of ten—that we often recognize as familiar to us, scenes, and landscapes, and conversations,
which we see or hear for the first time, and sometimes in countries never visited before,
is a result of the same causes. Nature shuts the door after everything that passes, and
pushes life onward in more perfected forms. The Chrysalis becomes a butterfly; the latter
never can become again a grub. In the stillness of the night-hours, when our bodily
senses are fast locked in the fetters of sleep, and our earthly body rests, the Astral form
becomes free. It then oozes out of its material body, and confabulates with the outward
world, and travels round the visible as well as the invisible worlds. In sleep the
Astral body, (soul) is in freer motion; then it soars out of the body and holds converse
with the spirits of the Astral Plane. Dreams, forebodings, prescience, prognostications and
presentiments are impressions left by our Astral spirit on our brain, which receives them
more or less distinctly according to the proportion of the blood with which it is supplied
during the hours of sleep. The more the body is exhuated, the freer is the spiritual
man, and the more vivid the impressions of our soul’s memory. In heavy and robust
sleep, dreamless and uninterrupted, upon awakening to outward consciousness, men may
sometimes remember nothing. But the impressions of scenes and landscapes which the
Astral body saw in its peregrinations are still there, though lying latent under the pressure
of matter. They may be awakened at any moment, and then, during such flashes of man’s
inner memory, there is an instantaneous interchange of energies between the visible and
the invisible world or between the earth plane and spirit life. Between the “micrographs” of
the cerebral ganglia and the photo-scenographic galleries of the Astral Light, a current
is established. And a man who knows that he had never visited in body, nor seen
the landscape and person that he recognizes, may well assert that still he has seen
and knows them, for the acquaintance was formed while travelling in “spirit.”
The deeper the “trance,” the less signs of life the body shows, the clearer become the
spiritual perceptions, and the more powerful are the soul’s visions. The soul, disburdened
of the body senses, shows activity of power in a far greater degree of intensity than it can
in a strong, healthy body. The organs of sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing are
proved to become far acuter in a hypnotized subject deprived of the possibility of exercising
them bodily, than while he uses them in his normal state.
Such facts alone, once proved, ought to stand as invincible demonstrations of the
continuity of individual life, at least for a certain period after the body has been left by us,
either by reason of its being worn out or by accident, but though during this brief sojourn
on earth, our soul may be assimilated to a light hidden under a bushel, it still shines more
or less bright and attracts to itself the influence of kindred Astral Spirits; and when the
thought of good or evil import is begotten in our brain, it draws to it impulses of like nature
as irresistibly as the magnet attracts the needle. This attraction is also proportionate to
the intensity with which the thought-impulse makes itself felt in the ether; and so it will
be understood how one man may impress himself upon his own epoch so forcibly that
the influence may be carried—through the ever-interchanging currents of energy between the
two worlds, the visible and the invisible—from one succeeding age to another, until it
affects a large portion of mankind. How much the ordinary man or woman of today
have allowed themselves to think in this direction, it would be difficult to say; but
that they have not learned all that there is to learn may be inferred from the fact
that there exists so much sickness, disease, misery, premature death, obsession and insanity.
You may regard what has been written here as you please, but there can be no doubt
that the properties of the Astral waves are of a much higher order in the arena of Nature
than those of the material world although even the men of science still find the latter
far beyond their comprehension, except in numerous but minute and often isolated
particulars. It would not become me to write further on this subject here. It is suf­
ficient for my purpose to say here that these facts are based upon what the Astral Light
certainly has done, and that it is capable of vastly more than any one has yet ventured to
say. However, I shall have more to say upon this subject in the future, and let the one
whose eye reads here, remember that—not a leaf waves, not an insect crawls, not a ripple
moves, but each motion is recorded by a thousand faithful scribes in infallible and indelible
Astral Scripture. Nature has all of the past and future faithfully photographed in the
Astral Light. To those who develop the inner or spiritual sight, there will be opened the
most hidden recesses of the domain of Nature which will yield up its secrets; and the
events of the most remote epochs rival in vividness of impression the flitting circumstances
of yesterday. The images of the events are imbedded in all-permeating, universal, and ever­
retaining medium, which the Adepts call the “Soul Of The World" otherwise known as the
Astral World or—Ether, or Astral Plane.

The Initiated Adept
SILENCE IS WISDOM S SENTINEL
By L. W. de Laurence
The following remarkable article, from the pen of de Laurence,
is the most interesting one of its kind that has ever been published in the
United States, as it undoubtedly shows the great difference that exists
between Adept-ship as found in India and Medium-ship as it exists in*
Europe and America. Western humanity generally looks only to the outer
and to the effects, seldom to the causes.
A study of this chapter will give the western student of Occultism
some idea as to the reason why Spiritualism and Medium-ship in America
and Europe are not a great success. The average medium of these coun­
tries does not follow the footsteps and teachings of the old Adepts and
Masters, with the result that their work is usually crude and unsatisfactory.
It would argue small discernment upon my part were I to suppose that I had been fol­
lowed thus far through the deeper branches of Occultism and Magic by any but true, sincere
Disciples or Mystics of some sort. Were it otherwise, I should certainly advise such to
spare themselves the trouble of reading this Chapter; for, although nothing is said that is
not strictly true, they -would not fail to regard the least wonderful of the narratives as
absolutely false, however substantiated.
To comprehend the principles of natural law involved in the several phenomena, here­
inafter described, the reader must keep in mind the fundamental propositions of the Oriental
philosophy which I have successively elucidated for the last twenty-five years in my teach­
ings. I will recapitulate very briefly:
First.—There is no miracle. Everything that happens is the result of law-eternal, im­
mutable, ever active. Apparent miracle is but the operation of forces antagonistic to what
Dr. W. B. Carpenter, F. R. S.—a man of great learning but little knowledge—calls “the
well-ascertained laws of nature.” Like many of his class, Dr. Carpenter ignores the fact
that there may be laws once “known,” now unknown to science.
Second.—Nature is triune: there is a visible, objective nature; an invisible, indwelling,,
energizing nature, the exact model of the other and its vital principle; and, above these
two, spirit, source of all forces, alone eternal, and indestructible. The lower two constantly
change; the higher third does not.
Third.—Man is also triune: he has his objective, physical body; his vitalizing astral
body (or soul), the real man; and these two are brooded over and illuminated by the third—
the sovereign, the immortal spirit. When the real man succeeds in merging himself with
the latter, he becomes an immortal entity.
Fourth.—Magic, as a science, is the knowledge of these principles, and of the way by
which the omniscience and omnipotence of the spirit and its control over nature’s forces
may be acquired by the individual while still in the body. Magic, as an art, is the application
of this knowledge in practice.
Fifth.—Arcane knowledge misapplied, is sorcery; beneficently used, is true Magic or
wisdom.
Sixth.—Mediumship is the opposite of Adeptship; the medium is the passive instrument
of foreign influences, the Adept actively controls himself and all inferior potencies.
Seventh.—All things that ever were, that are, or that will be, have their record upon
the astral light, or tablet of the unseen universe; the initiated Adept, by using the vision
of his own spirit, can know all that has been known or can be known.
Eighth.—Races of men differ in spiritual gifts as in color, stature, or any other external
quality; among some people seership naturally prevails, among others mediumship. Some
are addicted to sorcery and transmit its secret rules of practice from generation to genera­
tion, with a range of psychical phenomena, more or less wide, as the result.
Ninth.—One phase of magical skill is the voluntary and conscious withdrawal of. the
inner man (astral form) from the outer man (physical body). In the cases of some me­
diums withdrawal occurs, but it is unconscious and involuntary. With the latter the body
is more or less cataleptic at such times; but with the Adept the absence of the astral form
would not be noticed, for the physical senses are alert, and the individual appears only as
though in a state of abstraction.

AND SPIRITUAL
THE WANDERING ASTRAL FORM
To the movements of the wandering astral form neither time nor space offers obstacles.
The _thaumaturgist, thoroughly skilled in occult science, can cause himself (that is, his
physical body) to seem to disappear, or to apparently take on any shape that he may choose.
He may make his astral form visible, or he may give it protean appearances. In both
cases these results will be achieved by Magical Occult Powers possessed by the Adept.
But, while the astral form can go anywhere, penetrate any obstacle, and be seen at
any distance from the physical body, the latter is dependent upon ordindry methods of
transportation.
It may be levitated * under prescribed magnetic conditions, such as are taught in “India’s
Hood Unveiled,” but not pass from one locality to another except in the usual way. Hence
I discredit all stories of the aerial flight of mediums in the body, for such would be a
miracle, and miracle I repudiate. Inert matter may be, in certain cases and under certain
conditions, disintegrated, passed through walls, and recombined, but living animal organisms
cannot.
I believe, and East Indian Occultism teaches, that the abandonment of the living
body by the soul frequently occurs, and that we encounter every day, in every condition of
life,_ such living corpses. Various causes, among them overpowering fright, grief, despair,
a violent attack of sickness, or excessive sensuality may bring this about. The vacant
carcass may be entered and inhabited by the astral form of an Adept sorcerer, or an ele­
mentary (an earth-bound disembodied human soul), or, very rarely, an elemental. Of
course, an Adept of white magic has the same power, but unless some very exceptional and
great object is to be accomplished, he will never consent to pollute himself by occupying
the body of an impure person. In insanity, the patient’s astral being is either semi-paralyzed,
bewildered, and subject to the influence of every passing spirit of any sort, or it has de­
parted forever, and the body is taken possession of by some vampirish entity near its own
disintegration, and clinging desperately to earth, whose sensual pleasures it may enjoy
for a brief season longer by this expedient.
Tenth.—The corner-stone of Magic is an intimate practical knowledge of Hypnotism
and Occult Forces, their qualities, correlations, and potencies. Especially necessary is a
familiarity with their effects in and upon the animal kingdom and the Astral body of man.
There are occult properties in many other minerals, equally as strange as that in the
lodestone, which all practitioners of Magic must know, and of which so-called exact science
is wholly ignorant. Plants also have like mystical properties in a most wonderful degree,
and the secrets of the herbs, of dreams and enchantments are only lost of European
science, and needless to say, too, are unknown , to it, except in a few marked instances,
such as opium and hashish. Yet, the physical effects of even these noted herbs upon the
human system are regarded as evidences of a temporary mental disorder. The Occult
secrets of the old Adepts are still preserved, a'nd those who are aware of the nature of
Soma, know the properties of other plants as well.
To sum up all in a few words, Magic is spiritual wisdom; nature, the material ally,
pupil and servant of the Adept. One common vital principle pervades all things, and >this
is controllable by the perfected human will. The Hindu Adept can stimulate the move­
ments of the natural forces in plants and animals in a preternatural degree. Such experi­
ments are not obstructions of nature, but quickenings; the conditions of intenser vital
action are given.
The Adept,who has studied Hindu Magic and East Indian Occultism, can control the
sensations and alter conditions of the physical and astral bodies of other persons not
Adepts; he can also govern and employ, as he chooses, the spirits of the elements. He
can control the immortal spirit of any human being, living or dead, for all such spirits
are alike subject to a high grade Adept’s domination.
•Hindu Levitation—Means raising a body in the air without material means; being accomplished
only bv Occult Forces. Hindu Levitation is taught in that famous book “India’s Hood Unveiled."
de Laurence obtained the original manuscripts, from which this book
was printed, from Madras, India. This book has had a large sale and letters received from those
who have bought it state that they have been able to learn how to raise the human body of another

t Through the veil of all the Hieratic and Mystic allegories of the ancient dogmas, under
the seal of all the sacred writings, in the ruins of Nineveh or Thebes, on the worn stones of the
ancient temples, and on the blackened face of the sphinx of Assyria or Egypt, in the monstrous
or marvelous pictures which the sacred pages of the Hindu Vedas translate for the believers of
India, in the strange emblems of our old books of Alchemy, in the ceremonies of reception practiced
by all the mysterious Eastern Orders of the Adepts, we find traces of a doctrine everywhere the
same and everywhere carefully concealed from the curious. Oriental Occultism ever lias been
the nurse or godmother of all religions, the secret lever of all the intellectual forces, the “key”
of all divine obscurities, and the Absolute Invisible Power, in the ages when it was exclusively
reserved for the education of the old Hindu Sages and Masters.

There are two kinds of seership—that of the soul and that of the spirit. The seership
of the ancient Pythoness, or of the modern mesmerized subject, vary but in the artificial
modes adopted to induce the state of clairvoyance. But, as the visions of both depend upon
the greater or less acuteness of the senses of the astral body, they differ very widely
from the perfect, omniscient spiritual state; for, at best, the subject can get but glimpses
of truth, through the veil which physical nature interposes. The astral principle, or mind,
called by the Hindu Adept fav-atma, is the sentient soul, inseparable from the physical
brain, which it holds in subjection, and by which it is in its turn equally trammelled. This
is the ego, the intellectual life-principle of man, his conscious entity. While it is yet
within the material body, the clearness and correctness of its spiritual visions depend on
its more or less intimate relation with its higher Principle. When this relation is such
as to allow the most ethereal portions of the soul-essence to act independently of its
grosser particles and of the brain, it can unerringly comprehend what it sees; then only
is it the pure, rational, supersentient soul. That state is known in India as the Samadhi;
it is the highest condition of spirituality possible to man on earth. Fakirs try to obtain
such a condition by holding their breath for hours together during their religious exer­
cise and call this practice dam-sadhna. The Hindu terms Pranayama, Pratyahara, and
Dharana, all relate to different psychological states, and show how much more the
Sanscrit, and even the modern Hindu language are adapted to the clear elucidation of the
phenomena that are encountered by those who study this branch of psychological science,
than the tongues of modern peoples, whose experiences have not yet necessitated the
invention of such descriptive terms.
When the body is in the state of dharana—a total catalepsy of the physical frame—
the soul of the clairvoyant may liberate itself, and perceive things subjectively. And yet,
as the sentient principle of the brain is alive and active, these pictures of the past, present,
and future will be tinctured with the terrestrial perceptions of the objective world; the
physical memory and fancy will be in the way of clear vision. But the Seer-Adept knows
how to suspend the mechanical action of the brain. His visions will be as clear as truth
itself, uncolored and undistorted, whereas, the Western clairvoyant, unable to control the
vibrations of the astral waves, will perceive but more or less broken images through the
medium of the brain. The Hindu Adept can never take flickering shadows for realities,
for his memory being as completely subjected to his will as the rest of the body, he re­
ceives impressions directly from his spirit. Between his subjective and objective selves
there are no obstructive mediums. This is the real spiritual Seership, in which, according
to the Adept, soul is raised above all inferior good, when we reach "that which is supreme,
which is simple, pure and unchangeable, without form, color or human qualities: the God—,
our Nous."
This is the state which such Seers as Plotinus and Apollonius termed the "Union
with the Deity”; which the ancient Hindu Masters called I’svara, and the modern call-
“Samadhi"; but this state is as far above modern clairvoyance as the stars above glow­
worms. Plotinus, as is well known, was a clairvoyant-seer during his whole and daily
life; and yet, he had been united to his God but six times during the sixty-six years of
his existence, as he himself confessed to Porphyry.
The only power which is directly opposed to clairvoyance and true mediumship, or
looking into the future, is memory. Memory is an impediment to our Astral conceptions;
and hence, when we are agitated by the inspiring influence of soul sight, if memory of
worldly things intervenes, the enthusiastic energy ceases; for enthusiasm and the ecstasy
are contrary to each other. Should it be asked whether the soul is able to energize with­
out the memory, I reply, that its perception of universals proves that it is able. It has
perceptions, therefore, independent of the memory; at the same time, however, the memory
attends it in its energies, just as a storm pursues him who sails on the sea.
A medium, moreover, needs either a foreign intelligence—whether it be spirit or living
.nesmerizer—to overpower his physical and mental parts, or some factitious means to induce
trance. An Adept, and even a Chela (disciple) requires but a few minutes of "self-
contemplation.” The brazen columns of King Solomon’s Temple; the golden bells and
pomegranates of Aaron; the Jupiter Capitolinus of Augustus, hung around with har­
monious bells; and the brazen bowls of the Mysteries when the Kora were called, were
all intended for such artificial helps. So were the brazen bowls of Solomon hung ’round
with a double row of 200 pomegranates, which served as clappers within the hollow'
columns. The priestesses of Northern Germany, under the guidance of hierophants, could
never prophesy but amidst the roar of the tumultuous waters. Regarding fixedly the eddies
formed on the rapid course of the river, they readily induced the trance state.* So we
‘Today students and Disciples of the Occult obtain material and construct a 'Hindu Magic
Mirror which they use to induce the clairvoyant or trance state. Again, many use the Crystal
for this very sapie purpose.

read of Joseph, Jacob’s son, who sought for divine inspiration with his silver drinking■
cup, which must have had a very bright bottom to it. The priestesses of Dodona placed
themselves under the ancient oak of Zeus (the Pelasgian, not the Olympian god), and
listened intently to the rustling of the sacred leaves, while others concentrated their atten­
tion on the soft murmur of the cold spring gushing from underneath its roots. But the
Hindu Adept has no need of any such extraneous aids—the simple exertion of his wonder­
ful Occult-power is sufficient.
The Atharva-Veda teaches that the exercise of such power is the highest form of
Soul-power and its instantaneous response. To desire is to realize in proportion to the
intensity of the aspiration; and that, in its turn, is measured by inward purity.
Some of these nobler Vedantic precepts on the soul and man’s mystic powers are as
follows:—The Sankhya inculcates that the soul (i. e., astral body) has the following powers:
shrinking into a minute bulk to which everything is pervious; enlarging to a gigantic body;
assuming levity (rising along a sunbeam to the solar orb) ; possessing an unlimited reach
of organs, as touching the moon with the tip of a finger; irresistible will (for instance,
sinking into the earth as easily as in water) ; dominion over all things, animate or inani­
mate; faculty of changing the course of nature; ability to accomplish every desire. I will
here give their various appellations:
The powers .are called: 1, Anima; 2, Mahima; 3, Laghima; 4, Garima; 5, Prapti;
6, Prakamya; 7, Vashita; 8, Ishita, or divine power. The fifth, predicting future events,
understanding unknown languages, curing diseases, divining unexpressed thoughts, under­
standing the language of the heart. The sixth is the power of converting old age 'into
youth. The seventh is the power of mesmerizing human beings and beasts, and making
them obedient; it is the power of restraining passions and emotions. The eighth power
is the spiritual state, and presupposes the absence of the above seven powers, as in this
state the Yogi is full of God.
No writings, revealed or sacred, were allowed to be so authoritative and final as the
teaching of the soul. Some of the Rishis appear to have laid the greatest stress on this
supersensous source of knowledge.
From the remotest antiquity mankind as a whole has always been convinced of the
existence of a personal spiritual entity within the personal physical man. This inner
entity was more or less divine, according to its proximity to the crown—Chrestos. The
closer the union the more serene man’s destiny, the less dangerous the external conditions.
This belief is neither bigotry nor superstition, only an ever-present, instinctive feeling of
the proximity of another spiritual and invisible world, which, though it be subjective to the
senses of the outward man. is perfectly objective to the inner ego. Furthermore, men be­
lieved that there are external and internal conditions which affect the determination of our
will upon our actions. They rejected fatalism, for fatalism implies a blind course of
some still blinder power. But they believed in destiny, which from birth to death every man
is weaving thread by thread around himself, as a spider docs his cobweb; and this destiny
is guided either by that presence, termed by some the guardian angel, or our more intimate
astral inner man, who is but too often the evil genius of the man of flesh. Both these
lead on the outward man, but one of them must prevail; and from the very beginning
of the invisible affray the stern and implacable law of compensation steps in and takes
its course, following faithfully the fluctuations. When the last strand is woven, and man
is seemingly enwrapped in the net-work of his own doing, then he finds himself com­
pletely under the empire of this self-made destiny. It then either fixes him like the inert
shell against the immovable rock, or like a feather carries him away in a whirlwind
raised by his own actions.
The greatest philosophers of antiquity found it neither unreasonable nor strange that—
souls should come to souls, and impart to them conceptions of future things, occasionally
by letters, or by a mere touch, or by a glance reveal to them past events or announce
future ones. Moreover, the old Master Adepts all held that unembodied spirits or souls
could descend on earth and become guardians of mortal men. We should not seek to
deprive those souls, which are still in the body, of that power by which the former know
future events and are able to announce them. It is not probable that the soul gains a new
power of prophecy after separation from the body, and which before it did. not possess.
We may rather conclude that it possessed all these powers during its union with the
body, although in a lesser perfection—For as the sun does not shine only when it passes from
among the clouds, but has always been radiant and has only appeared dim and obscured frjl
vapors, the soul does not only receive the power of looking into futurity, when it passes,
from the body as from a cloud, but has possessed it always, though dimmed by connection,
with the earthly. ■

THE SPIRIT HAND
A familiar example of one phase of the power of the soul or astral body to manifest
itself, is the phenomenon of the so-called spirit-hand. In the presence of certain mediums
these seemingly detached members will gradually develop from a luminous nebula, pick
up a pencil, write messages, and then dissolve before the eyes of the witnesses. Many
such cases are recorded by perfectly competent and trustworthy persons. These phenomena
are real, and require serious consideration. But false “phantom-hands” have sometimes
been taken for the genuine. At Dresden I once saw a hand and arm, made for the pur­
pose of deception, with an ingenious arrangement of springs that would cause the ma­
chine to imitate to perfection the movements of the natural member, while exteriorly it
would require close inspection to detect its artificial character. In using this, the dis­
honest medium slips his natural arm out of his sleeve, and replaces it with the mechanical
substitute; both hands may then be made to seem resting upon the table, while in fact
one is touching the sitters, showing itself, knocking the furniture, and making other
phenomena.
The mediums for real manifestations are least able, as a rule, to comprehend or ex­
plain them. Among those who have written most intelligently upon the subject of these
luminous hands, may be reckoned Dr. Francis Gerry Fairfield, author of “Ten Years
Among The Mediums.” A medium himself, he is yet a strong opponent of the spiritualistic
theory. Discussing the subject of the “phantom-hand,” he testifies that “this the writer
has personally witnessed, under conditions of test provided by himself, in his own room,
in full daylight, with the medium seated upon a sofa six to eight feet from the table,
hovering upon which the apparition (the hand) appeared. The application of the poles
of a horseshoe magnet to the hand caused it to waver perceptibly, and threw the medium
into violent convulsions—pretty positive evidence that the force concerned in the phe­
nomenon was generated in his own nervous system.
Dr. Fairfield’s deduction that the fluttering "phantom-hand” is an emanation from
the medium is logical, and it is correct. The test of the horseshoe magnet proves in a
scientific way what every Hindu Kabalist would affirm upon the authority of experience,
no less than philosophy. The “force concerned in the phenomena” is the will of the
medium, exercised unconsciously to the outer man, which for the time is semi-paralyzed
and cataleptic; the “phantom-hand” is an extrusion of the man’s inner or astral member.
This is that real self whose limbs the surgeon cannot amputate; they remain behind after
the outer casing is cut off, and (all theories of exposed or compressed nerve termini to the
contrary, notwithstanding) have all the sensations the physical parts formerly experienced.
This is that spiritual (astral) body which “is raised in incorruption.” It is useless to-—
argue that these are spirit-hands; for, admitting even that at every seance human spirits
of many kinds are attracted to the medium, and that they do guide and produce some
manifestations, yet to make hands or faces objective they are compelled to use either the
astral limbs of the medium or the materials furnished them by the elementals, or yet the
combined aural emanations of all persons present. Pure spirits will not and cannot show
themselves objectively; those that do are not pure spirits, but elementary and impure.
Woe to the medium who falls a prey to such.
The same principle involved in the unconscious extrusion of a phantom limb by the
catalyptic medium applies to the projection of his entire “double" or astral body. This
may be withdrawn by the will of the medium’s own inner self, without his retaining in
his physical brain any recollection of such an intent—that is one phase of man’s dual
capacity. It may also be effected by elementary and elemental spirits, to whom he may
stand in the relation of mesmeric subject. Dr. Fairfield is right in one position taken in
his book, viz.: mediums are usually diseased, and in many if not most cases the children
or near connections of mediums. But he is wholly wrong in attributing all psychical
phenomena to morbid physiological conditions. The Adepts of Eastern Magic are uni­
formly in perfect mental and bodily health, and in fact the voluntary and independent
production of phenomena is impossible to any others. I have known many, and never a
sick man among them. The Adept retains perfect consciousness; shows no change of
bodily temperature, or other sign of morbidity; requires no “conditions,” but will do his
feats anywhere and everywhere; and instead of being passive and in subjection to a
foreign influence, rules the forces with iron will. But I have elsewhere shown that the
medium and the Hindu Adept are as opposed as the poles. I will only add here that the
body, soul, and spirit of the Adept are all conscious and working in harmony, and the body
of the American or European medium is an inert clod, and even their soul may be away
in a dream while its habitation is occupied by another.
The power to control the Occult forces of Nature, and produce spirit materialization,
is universally communicated to all Initiates, Disciples and Neophytes of Eastern Orders

of sacred mysteries. These mysteries also constitute the foundation of all those ancient
religions out of which Christianity was evolved. Various eminent sages, notably Christina,
Pythagoras, Plato, Apollonius, Buddha, Guatama, the messenger of the Mystics, and Jesus,
the Judean Prince, were members of this Sacred Order of the Adepts. Jesus, the illus­
trious teacher of the Jews, was at all times conscious and working in perfect harmony
with spiritual forces, for his astral form was seen by his Disciples many days after his
death.
An Adept of India can not only project and make visible a hand, a foot, or any other
portion of his body, but the whole of it. I have seen one do this, in full day, while his
hands and feet were being held by' a sceptical American doctor whom he wished to
surprise.* Little by little the whole astral body oozed out like a vapory cloud, until before
us stood two forms, of which the second was an exact duplicate of the first, only slightly
more shadowy.
The medium need not exercise any will-power. It suffices that she or he shall know
what is expected by the investigators. .The medium’s “spiritual” entity, when not obsessed
by other spirits, will act- outside the will or consciousness of the physical being, as surely
as it. acts when within the body during a fit of somnambulism. Its perceptions, external
and internal, will be acuter and far more developed, precisely as they are in the sleep­
walker. And this is why “the materialized form sometimes knows more than the medium,”
for the intellectual perception of the astral entity is proportionally as much higher than the
corporeal intelligence of the medium in its normal state as the spirit entity is finer than
itself. Generally the medium will be found cold, the pulse will have visibly changed, and
a state of nervous prostration succeeds the phenomena, bunglingly, and without discrimi­
nation attributed to disembodied spirits; whereas, but one-third of them may be produced
by the latter, another third by elementals, and the rest by the astral double of the medium
himself.
But while it is my firm belief that most of the physical manifestations, i. e., those
which neither need nor show intelligence nor great discrimination, are produced mechan­
ically by the scin-lecca (double) of the medium, as a person in sound sleep will when
apparently awake do things of which he will retain no remembrance, the purely subjective
phenomena are but in a very small proportion of cases due to the action of the personal
astral body. They are mostly, and according to the moral, intellectual, and physical
purity of the medium, the work of either the elementary, or sometimes very human spirits.
Elementals have naught to do with subjective manifestations. In rare cases it is the
divine spirit of the medium himself that guides and produces them.
As Babu Peary Chand Mittra says, in a letter to the President of the National
Association of Spiritualists, Mr. Alexander Calder, “a spirit is an essence or power, and
has no form. . . . The very idea of form implies ‘materialism.’ The spirits (astral souls,
we should say) . . . can assume forms for a time, but form is not their permanent state.
The more material is our soul, the more material is our conception of spirits.”
Epimenides, the Orphikos, was renowned for his “sacred and marvellous nature,” and
for the faculty his soul possessed of quitting its body “as long and as often as it pleased.”
The ancient philosophers who have testified to this ability may be reckoned by dozens.
Apollonius left his body at a moment’s notice, but it must be remembered Apollonius was an
Adept—a “magician.” Had he been simply a medium, he could not have performed such
feats at will. Empedocles of Agrigentum, the Pythagorean thaumaturgist, required no
conditions to arrest a waterspout which had broken over the city. Neither did he need
any to recall a woman to life, as he did. Apollonius used no darkened room in which to
perform his aethrobatic feats. Vanishing suddenly in the air before the eyes of Domitian
and a whole crowd of witnesses (many thousands), he appeared an hour after in the
grotto of Puteoli. But investigation would have shown that his physical body having
become invisible by the concentration of akasa about it, he could, walk off unperceived to
some secure retreat in the neighbourhood, and an hour after his astral form appear at
Puteoli to his friends, and seem to be the man himself.
No more did Simon Magus wait to be entranced to fly off in the air before the apostles
and crowds of witnesses. It requires conjuration and ceremonies, circle-making and the
burning of Temple Incense to develop true Adept-ship and the production of genuine
*The Boulogne (Franco) correspondent of an English journal says that he knows of a gentle­
man who has had an arm amputated at the shoulder, "who is certain that he has a spiritual
arm, which he sees, and actually feels with his other hand. lie can touch anything, and even
pull up tilings with the spiritual or phantom arm and hand.” The party knows nothing or
spiritualism. I give this as I get it, without verification, but it merely corroborates what I
have seen in the case of an Eastern Adept. This eminent Master and practical Kaoalist, can at
will project his astral arm, and with the hand take up, move, and carry objects even at a con­
siderable distance from where he may be sitting or standing. I have often seen him thus
minister to the wants of a favorite Disciple.

spiritual phenomena. The human spirit’is so great a thing that no man can express it;
as God (Nature) is eternal and unchangeable, so also is the mind of man. If we rightly
understood its powers, nothing would be impossible to us on earth. The imagination is
strengthened and developed through faith in our will. Faith must confirm the imagination,
for faith establishes the will.
In order to bridge the valleys of ignorance, the mind must not stop at the material,
but must penetrate to the Spirit, the Cause, and for this two kinds of knowledge, the lower
and the higher, must be recognized.
We find a foreshadowing of some such ideas held by the Greek philosophers, as in
the question of Pythagoras, “What is that through which when it is known the knower
thereof knows everything else?”
Some of the Greeks said, we must first ascend to the general, from which descent to
the particular is easy. Such, however, is directly opposite to the modern method, which
delights in going into comparisons and particulars based on some theory formed from a
material standpoint. Humanity in general looks only to the outer and to effects, seldom
to the causes.
True knowledge proceeds from an endeavor to attain to the Universal Soul of all.
By a true effort to reach that, a knowledge of the particular parts may be gained. This
may not be easy, especially amid the conventionalities of life, but it is worth trying for.
The endeavor produces an action on the mind, and actions are motives let loose, and
when they are noble and unselfish, man looks up, and, like one awakened from long sleep,
he finds that Nature’s infinitude fills all space, and is far more apparent to his intelligence
than atmosphere or sunlight. In this glorious awakening he realizes the meaning of the
words handed down from the wisdom of the Egyptians through the long ages: “Our
eyes are holden, that we cannot see the things that stare us in the face, until the hour
arrives when the mind is ripened; then we behold them."
The highest knowledge attainable is gained through silence and purity of thought.
Silence is wisdom’s sentinel. Purity of thought cleanses the mirror of the Soul, but the
windows of many men’s Souls are far too dirty to admit Spiritual Wisdom. All men
should make their meditations their chosen companions, for refined thoughts are the best
fruits of a refined and cultivated mind, and he whose tastes lead him to admire nature
and beauty in all things is half prepared for Spirit life.
Forms come into existence according to one universal law. One kind of salt produces
always the same kind of crystal; a note struck upon a musical instrument calls forth a
corresponding note on a similar instrument. The higher we arise on the Spiritual plane,
the more perfectly the attunement of Spirit force will unite with our own; and as the
mirror of our monitor is polished we reflect the Truth of Ideas, therefore according to
thoughts of man does he.exalt or debase the clothing about pure Ideas.
Is death more to be feared because it is an enigma the mysteries of which our dull
minds cannot fathom and our poor fancy cannot comprehend?
Spirit and the growth of the Soul being always opposite to human ways, man is apt
to feel that the dawn of the Soul’s new life, which we call death, is a sad and mournful
thing, like starting out alone on an obscure earthly pilgrimage. Not so, but rather like
the budding and bursting into bloom of flowers in spring, which at harvest time will have
ripened into perfect fruit. Death is but the beginning of life, a joyous reunion of
perfect life.
In tracing the Evolution of man, we regard him as an expression of the Infinite One.
All things and forms of life below man are likewise expressions of the Infinite One, but
we do not believe that man was all these lower forms before he became man. These are
different orders of creation, related to but distinctly separated from one another. They
are inter-related, all dependent on the same source, but they can never blend together nor
become confused and mixed.
Above man as a distinct order come Spirits, the inhabitants of the numberless states
that surround the earth, and to attain to the highest of which may take thousands of
years. The modes of existence and methods of thought of these states are as unthinkable
to man as is his plane of life to the animal. But the Spiritual state is not the last; celestial
states beyond comprehension exist removed from earth influences, the abodes of the
redeemed. Spirits are messengers who act as emissaries from higher to lower states,
themselves the while learning of that which is above them, that in time they may assume
the celestial degree.
The animal is in a Soul-state and is guided by unerring instinct. Man exercises will­
choice, and this is in a state of transition to a higher Soul-plane. Spirits assume that Soul­
plane and are guided by intuition, the correlate of the instinct of the animal. The Angel
is a transitional order like man, and by volition attains what we would call knowledge to
prepare for the celestial state, which is that of the Perfect Man—Will and Soul being
One,— L. W. de Laurence.

ANCIENT EGYPT
THE CRADLE OF SCIENCE AND OF WISDOM
The Immutable Law Of Equilibrium
BY L. W. de LAURENCE
It is in Egypt that Magic attains the grade of completion as an universal science and
is formulated as a perfect doctrine. As a summary of all the dogmas which obtained in
the ancient world, nothing surpasses and indeed nothing equals those few paragraphs
graven on precious stone by Hermes and denominated the Emerald Tablet. Unity of
being and unity in the harmony of things, according to the ascending and descending
scales; progressive and proportional evolution of the Word; immutable law of equilib­
rium and graduated progress of universal analogies; correspondence between the idea and
its expression providing a measure of likeness between Creator and created; essential
mathematics of the infinite, proved by the dimensions of a single angle in the finite: all
this is expressed by the one proposition : "that which is above is like that which is below,
and that which is below is like that which is above, for the fulfilment of the wonders of
the one thing.” Hereunto are added the revelation and illuminating description of the
creative agent, the pantomorphic fire, the great medium of occult force—in a word, the
Astral Light.
“The sun is its father and the moon its mother; the wind has borne it in the belly
thereof.” It follows that this light has enamanated from the sun and has received form
and rhythmical movement from the influences of the moon, while the atmosphere is its
receptacle and prison. “The earth is its nurse”—that is to say, it is equilibrated and set
in motion by the central heat of the earth. “It is the universal principle, the Telesma
of the world.”
Hermes goes on to set forth in what manner this light, which is also a force, can be
applied as a lever, as an universal dissolvent and as a formative and coagulative agent;
how also this light must be extracted from the bodies in which it lies latent in order to
imitate all the artifices of Nature by the aid of its diverse manifestations, as fire, motion,
splendor, radiant gas, scalding water or, finally, igneous earth. The Emerald Tablet
contains all Magic in a single page.1 The other works attributed to Hermes, such as
the Divine Pymander, Asclepius, Minerva of the World, &c., are generally regarded by
critics as productions of the School of Alexandria; but they contain, notwithstanding, the
Hermetic traditions which were preserved in theurgic sanctuaries. For those who possess
the "Keys of Symbolism" the doctrines of Hermes can never be lost; amidst all their ruin,
the monuments of Egypt are as so many scattered leaves which can be collected and the
book of those doctrines thus reconstructed entirely. In that vast book the capital letters
are temples and the sentences are cities punctuated with obelisks and by the Sphinx.
The physical division of Egypt was itself a magical synthesis, and the names of its
provinces corresponded to the ciphers of sacred numbers. The realm of Sesostris was
divided into three parts; of these, Upper Egypt, or the Thebaid, was a type of the celestial
world and the land of ecstasy; Lower Egypt was the symbol of earth; while Middle or
Central Egypt was the land of science and of high initiation. Each of these parts was
subdivided into ten provinces, called Nomes, and was placed under the particular protection
of a god. There were therefore thirty gods, and they were grouped by threes, giving sym­
bolical expression in this matter to all possible conceptions of the Triad within the decad,
or otherwise to the threefold material, philosophical and religious significance of absolute
ideas attached primitively to numbers. We have thus the triple unity or the first Triad,
the triple binary3 formed by the first Triad and its reflection, being the “Star of Solomon”;
1 The legend concerning the Emerald tablet is that it was found by Alexander the Great in
the tomb of Hermes, which was hidden by the priests of Egypt in the depths of the Great Pyramid
of Gizeh. It was supposed to have been written by Hermes on a large plate of emerald by means
of a pointed diamond. I believe that there is no Greek version extant, and it is referred by Louis
Figuier to the seventh century of the Christian era, or thereabouts. See L’Alchimie et les
Alchimistes, p 42.
“The text says: le triple benaire ou le mirage du triangle, but it is obvious that the reflected
triad cannot be termed binary. The expression is confused, but the meaning is that the first
triangle equals unity, or the number 1; the second triad corresponds to the duad, or number 2;
the third triad to the number 3, and so onward.

the triple Triad or the complete idea under each of its three forms; the triple quaternary,
being the cyclic number of astral revolutions, and so onward. The geography of Egypt
under Sesostris is therefore a pantacle or symbolical summary of the entire magical dogma
originating with Zoroaster and rediscovered or formulated more precisely by Hermes.
In this manner did the land of Egypt become as a great volume, and the instructions
contained therein were multiplied by translation into pictures, sculptures, architecture,
through the length and breadth of the towns and in all temples. The very desert had its
eternal teachings, and its word of stone was set squarely on the foundations of the pyramids.
The pyramids themselves stood like boundaries of human intelligence, in the presence of
which the colossal Sphinx meditated age after age, sinking by insensible degrees into the
desert sand. Even at this day its head, defaced by the work of time, still emerges from
its sepulchre, as if waiting expectantly the signal for its complete entombment at the coming
of a human voice revealing to a new world the problem of the pyramids.
Egypt from the writer’s standpoint is “the cradle of science and of wisdom,” for it
clothed with images the antique dogma of the first Zoroaster more exactly and more
purely, if not more richly, than those of India. The Sacerdotal Art and the Royal Art
made Adepts by Initiation in Egypt, and such Initiation was not restricted within the
egotistic limits of caste. We know that a Jewish bondsman himself attained not only
Initiation but the rank of minister in chief, perhaps even of Grand Hierophant, for he
espoused the daughter of an Egyptian priest, and there is evidence that the priesthood in
that country tolerated no misalliance. Joseph realized in Egypt the dream of communism;
he established the priesthood and the state as sole proprietors and thus sole arbiters of
labor and wealth. In this way he abolished distress and turned the whole of Egypt into a
patriarchal family. It is a matter of common knowledge that his elevation was due to
skill in the interpretation of dreams, a science which even devout Christians now refuse
to credit, though they recognize that the Bible, which narrates the wonderful divinations
of Joseph, is the work of the Holy Spirit. The science of Joseph was none other than a
comprehension of the natural analogies which subsist between ideas and images, or
between the Word and its symbols. He knew that—the soul when immersed by sleep in
the Astral Light, perceives the reflection of its most secret thoughts and even of its pre­
sentiments; he knew further that the art of translating the hieroglyphics of sleep is the
key of universal lucidity, seeing that all intelligent beings have revelations in dreams.
The basis of absolute hieroglyphical science was an alphabet in which deities were repre­
sented by letters, letters represented ideas, ideas were convertible into numbers, and
numbers were perfect signs. This hieroglyphical alphabet was the great secret which
Moses enshrined in his Kabalah; its Egyptian origin is commemorated in the Sepher
Yetzirah, in which it is referred to Abraham. Now this alphabet is the famous “Book Of
Thoth,” and it was divined by Court de Gebelin that it has been preserved to our own
day in the form of Tarrot cards. It passed later on into the hands of Etteilla, who inter­
preted it in the wrong sense, for even, a study extending over thirty years could not atone
for his want of common sense or supply deficiencies in his education. The record exists
still among the drift and waste of Egyptian monuments.; and its most curious, most com­
plete key is found in the great work on Egypt by Athanasius Kircher. It is the copy of
an Isiac tablet which belonged to the celebrated Cardinal Bembo. The tablet in question
is of copper with figures in enamel, and it has been unfortunately lost. The copy supplied
by Kircher is, however, exact.4 The learned Jesu it divined that it contained the
‘'hieroglyphic key” of sacred alphabets, though he was unable to develop the explanation.
It is divided into three equal compartments; above are the twelve houses of heaven and
below are the corresponding distributions of labor throughout the year, while in the
middle place are twenty-one sacred signs answering to the letters of the alphabet. In
the midst of all is a seated figure of the pantomorphic Iynx, emblem of universal being
and corresponding as such to the Hebrew Yod, or to that unique letter from which all
other letters were formed. The Iynx is encircled by the Ophite Triad, answering to the
Three Mother Letters of the Egyptian and Hebrew alphabets.0 On the right are the
ibimorphic and serapian triads; on the left are those of Nepthys and Hecate, representing
active and passive, fixed and volatile, fructifying fire and generating water. Each pair of
‘The reference is to Athanasius Kircher's CEdipus JEgyptiacus, 3 vols. in folio, bound usually
in four, published at Rome, 1652-1054. The Mensa Isiaca, being the Bemblne Tablet, so called
because its discovery is connected with the name of Cardinal Bembo, is in the third volume—a
folding plate beautifully produced. The original is exceedingly late and is roughly termed a
forgery. In 1069 the Tablet was reproduced on a larger scale by means of a number of folding
plates in the Mensa Isiaca of Laurentius Pignorius. Both works are exceedingly rare. I suppose
that these are the only records of the Tablet now extant, with the exception of a large copy In
my possession made from the above sources.
8 It may be mentioned that the Hebrew alphabet was divided into (a) Three Mother Letters,
namely, Aleph, Mem and Shin : (b) Seven Double Letters, being Beth, Oimel, Daleth, Kaph, Pe,
Resh,'Tau; and Cc) Twelve Simple Letters, or He, Vau, Zain, Heth, Teth, Yod, Lamed, Nun,

triads in conjunction with the centre produces a septenary, and a septenary is contained
in the centre. Three septenaries furnish the absolute number of the three worlds, as
well as the complete number of primitive letters, to which a complementary sign is added,
like zero to the nine numerals. The ten numbers and the twenty-two letters are termed in
Kabalism the Thirty-Two Paths Of Wisdom, and their philosophical description is the
subject of that venerated primaeval book known as the Sepher Yetzirah, the text of which
will be found in the collection of Pistorius and elsewhere.7 The alphabet of Thoth is
the original of our Tarot only in an indirect manner, seeing that the latter is of Jewish
origin in the extant copies and that its pictures are not older than the reign of Charles VII.
The cards of Jacquemin Gringonneur are the first Tarots of which we have any knowl­
edge, but they reproduce symbols belonging to the highest antiquity. The game in its
modern form was an experiment on the part of astrologers to restore the king, who has
been mentioned, to reason. The oracles of the Tarot give answers8 as exact as mathe­
matics and measured as the harmonies of Nature. Such answers result from the varied
combinations of the different signs. But it requires a considerable exercise of reason to
make use of an instrument belonging to reason and to science; the poor king, in his child­
ish condition, saw only the playthings of an infant in the artist’s pictures and he turned
the mysterious Kabalistic alphabet9 into a game of cards.
We are told by Moses that the Israelites carried away the sacred vessels of the
Egyptians when they came out of the land of bondage. The account is allegorical, for
the great prophet would scarcely have encouraged his people in an act of theft; the sacred
vessels in question were the mysteries of Egyptian knowledge, acquired by Moses himself
at the court of Pharaoh. I am by no means suggesting that the miracles of this man of
God are referable to Magic; but we know on the authority of the Bible that Jannes and
Mambres, who were the magicians of Pharaoh and consequently grand hierophants of
Egypt, began by performing, in virtue of their art, wonders which were similar to those
of Moses. They transformed wands into serpents and serpents again into wands, which
might be explicable by prestige or fascination; they changed water into blood; they pro­
duced a swarm of frogs in a moment; but they could not cause flies to appear, or other
parasitic insects, for reasons which I have explained already, as also the manner in which
they were forced to confess themselves vanquished.
Moses triumphed and led the Israelites out of the land of bondage. It was at this
period that true science became lost to Egypt, for the priests, abusing the implicit con­
fidence of the people, allowed that knowledge to degenerate into brutalizing idolatry.
Such is the rock of peril for esoteric science; the truth must be veiled, yet not hidden
from the people; symbolism must not be disgraced by a lapse into absurdity; the sacred
veil of Isis must be preserved in its beauty and dignity. It was over this that the Egyptian
priesthood failed; the vulgar and the foolish understood the hieroglyphic forms of Isis
and Hermanubis as real things, so that Osiris was understood to be an ox, while the wise
Hermes was a dog. The transformed Osiris masqueraded in the fantastic guise of the
bull of Apis, nor did the priests hinder the people from adoring flesh intended for their
kitchens. It was time to save the holy traditions; Moses established a new nation and
forbade all worship of images; but. the people unfortunately had dwelt long among
idolaters, and memories of the bull of Apis remained with them in the desert. We know
the history of that Golden Calf to which the children of Israel have been always a little
addicted. Moses, however, did not wish the sacred hieroglyphics to pass out of memory,
and he sanctified them by their consecration to the purified worship of the true God. We
shall see how all objects which entered into the cultus of Jehovah were symbolic in
character and recalled the venerable signs of primaeval revelation. But we must first finish
with the Gentiles and follow through pagan civilization the story of materialized hiero­
glyphics and of ancient rites degenerated, more of which will be given later on.
7 The Septier Yetzirah was first made known to Latin reading Europe by William Postel.
Publication took place at Bale in 1547. It is said to have been reissued at Amsterdam in 164(>.
The collection of Pistorius, entitled Artis Cahalisticae Scriptores, belongs to 1587. Later and
modern editions of the Hook of formation are fairly numerous. It was translated into French,
together with the Arabic commentary of It. Saddya Gaon, by Mayor Lambert, in 1891.
8 As stated above, the oracles of the Tarot give answers as exact as mathematics and measured
as the harmonies of Nature. These famous fortune telling cards, “The Tarot,” show the Occult
signification of each and give the correct information whenever a particular answer is desired.
The Tarot pack consists of seventy-eight cards—namely, four suits of fourteen cards each, and
twentv-two symbolic numbered trumps. These remarkable cards are beautifully printed in red,
black‘blue and oriental yellow. They are to be obtained only through de Laurence and will
be found listed under Order No. shown elsewhere on these pages.
»ln face of existing evidence, the description of the Tarot Trumps Major as a Kabalistic
alphabet has as much and as little to support it as the claim that they constitute an Egyptian
Book of Thoth. • It has been reported to me, however, that there is an unknown Jewish Tarot,
and It may interest students of the subject to know that before long I hope to be able to give
some account at first band concerning it. There is little reason to suppose that It will prove (a)
ancient or (l>) Kabalistic; but as one never knows what is at one’s threshold, I put the fact on
record for whatever it may be worth in the future. Meanwhile, it is quite idle to say that our
popular fortune-telling cards are anywhere near as good as the Tarots.

Scriptural Promises Of A Fu­
ture Life—“Life Everlasting”
In both the Old and the New
Testament there are continual
references to a future life—the
"life eternal," and a “life ever­
lasting." The distinguished scien­
tist, Sir Oliver Lodge, asserts
that what the Bible has so abun­
dantly promised it is reasonable
for science to hope to prove to be
true.
If God communicated with
man, as frequently narrated in
the Old Testament, and if Christ
was in communication with His
Father during His life time, and
in communication with those who
were nearest Him on earth after
His death—why should science
hesitate to attempt to discover the
means of communication between
the living and the dead?
It has been noted that there are
fewer references to Eternal Life
in the Old Testament than in the
New Testament, and the sugges­
tion is made that the Jews took
it for granted, and did not deem
it necessary to dwell upon this
subject. That there was a pre­
vailing belief in the survival of
men after death is plainly shown
by such incidents as Saul and the
Witch of Endor. Other sugges­
tions are found in the book of
Job and’ in Psalms, as well as in
the prophetical writings.
But the most frequent explicit
statements as to the Future Life
are to be found in the New Testa­
ment. In fact, the death of Jesus
is marked by a supreme belief in
the resurrection not only of Him­
self, but of the two thieves with
whom He was crucified. For
Jesus said to one of the thieves:
“Eerily, I say unto thee, to-day
shalt thou be with me in Para­
dise.”—Luke xxiii.: 43.
Jesus is recorded as having A FAMILY MEETING IN SPIRIT LIFE.
preached the resurrection of the
body, notably in the twenty-second chapter of Matthew: “But as touching the resurrection of
the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead,
but of the living."—(31, 32.}

ll" ^'^| AND SPIRITUAL
The twentieth chapter of St. John contains the doctrine of the Resurrection, for in it
is the record of Jesus speaking to Mary at the tomb, saying: "Touch me not; for I am
not yet ascended to my Father.’’ After she had told the disciples, Jesus “stood in their
midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.” (verse 19.) It is further recorded that
Jesus showed Himself to the disciples again at the Sea of Tiberias, and after that the
apostles preached the Resurrection, of which they had been witnesses, as may be read in
Acts, iv.: 2. They taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from
the dead.
Among the striking Scriptural promises of an existence beyond the grave are the
following:
“There in the Resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven?”—Mark, xii.: 23.
“And this life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ
whom thou hast sent.”—John, xvii.: 3.
“And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.”—1 John, ii.: 25.
“Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that
sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from
death unto life.”—John, v.: 24.
“As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion:
for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.”—Psalm, cxxxiii.: 3.
“Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
“To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and
immortality, eternal life.”—Romans, ii.: 6, 7.
“For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto
you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us.”—1 John, i.: 2.
“Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
unto eternal life.”—Jude, 21.
“Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew
forth all long suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to
life everlasting.”—1 Timothy, i.: 16.
“Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto ever­
lasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father
sealed.”—John, vi.: 27.
“Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of
the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.
“Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him
up at the last day.”—John, vi.: 53.
“My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
“And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man
pluck them out of my hand.”—John, x.: 27,28.
“He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him
that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise
of God.”—Rev., ii.: 7.
“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”—John, iii.: 16.
THE FUTURE LIFE
The most profound problem of human life, and the most pitiful and pathetic cry of
the human soul throughout all ages, has been the problem and cry, “If a man die shall he

TEACHINGS OF THE ANCIENTS
'Who can study carefully the ancient religious and cosmogonic myths
without perceiving that the striking similitude of conceptions, in their exo­
teric form and esoteric spirit, is the result of no mere coincidence, but
manifests a concurrent design? They show that already in those ages,
which are shut out from our sight by the impenetrable mist of traditions,
human religious thought developed in uniform sympathy in every portion
of the globe. Christians call this adoration of nature in her most con­
cealed verities—Pantheism.”
"But if the latter, which worships and reveals to us God in space in
His only possible objective form,—that of visible nature—perpetually re­
minds humanity of Him who created it. and a religion of theological dog­
matism only serves to conceal Him the more from our sight, which is the
better adapted to the needs of man-kind?” de Laurence.
Let the investigator compare the boasted modern science with the teachings of the
ancients; this improved modern theology of the church with the "secret doctrines” of the
ancient universal religion.
Perhaps he may thus discover a neutral ground whence he can reach and profit by both.
Would it be strict justice to condemn to critical lapidation the greatest of modern
authors, such as de Laurence, for entirely rejecting the authority of both these com­
batants—Science and Theology?
Is not the sincere student and honest investigator bound rather to take as the true
aphorism of this century, the declaration of Horace Greeley?
“I accept unreservedly the views of no man, living or dead.”
Such, at all events, will be the motto of the real investigator, and this principle will be
his constant guide throughout his search for universal truth and power.
Such truths as are taught by de Laurence are bound to rise amid the tottering
ruins of self-styled revealed religions and materialistic philosophies.
And so, while the clergy, following their interpretations of the Bible, and science its
self-made codex of possibilities in nature, refuse spiritualistic teachings a fair hearing,
real science and true religion are silent, and gravely wait further developments.
Every Nation has had its Occult Mysteries and hierophants. Even the Jews had their
Peter—Tanian or Rabbin, like Hillel, Akiba, and other famous Kabalists, who alone could
impart the terrible knowledge contained in .the Merkaba. In India, there was in ancient
times one, and now there are several hierophants scattered about the country, attached to
the principal pagodas, who are known as the Brahm-atruas.
In Thibet the chief hierophant is the Dalai, or Taley-Lama of Lha-ssa.
Among Christian nations, the Catholics alone have preserved this ancient custom, in
the person of their Pope, albeit they have sadly disfigured its majesty and the dignity of
the sacred office.
Very few of today know the meaning of the term Kabalist. The very name is taken
from Kabala and means—an unwritten or oral tradition.
The Kabalist is a student of “secret science,” one who interprets the hidden meaning
of the Scriptures with the help of the symbolical Kabala, and explains the real one by
these means.
The Tanaim were the first Kabalists among the Jews; they appeared at Jerusalem
about the beginning of the third century before the Christian era.
The Books of Ezekiel, Daniel, Henoch, and the Revelation of St. John are purely
Kabalistical. This secret doctrine is identical with that of the Chaldeans, and includes, at
the same time, much of the Persian wisdom, or “Magic.”
de LAURENCE’S SECRET FORMULAE
de Laurence, in this Volume, which treats most fully of Natural Magic, enume­
rates a whole Catalogue of secret formulae for producing extraordinary effects by employ­
ing the Occult powers of nature so that, even those spirits who remain invisible can com­
municate with mortals through their awakened inner senses, as in clairvoyance, clair-
audience and trance. Men possessed of this knowledge and exercising such powers
patiently toil for something better than the vain glory of a passing fame. Seeking it not
they become immortal, as do all who labor for the good of the race, forgetful of mean
self. Illuminated with the light of eternal truth, these rich-poor masters, of Nature’s
Occult forces, fix their attention upon the things that lie beyond the common ken, recog­
nizing nothing inscrutable but the First Cause, and finding no question unsolvable. To
dare to know, to will, and Remain Silent, is, their constant rule; to be beneficent, un­
selfish and unpretending is, with them, a spontaneous impulse. Disdaining the rewards of

petty traffic, spurning wealth, luxury, pomp, and worldly power, they aspire to knowledge
as the most satisfying of all acquisitions. These great Masters of, “the occult" esteem
poverty, hunger, toil, and the evil report of men, as none too great a price to pay for its
achievement. They, who might have become possessed of great wealth, suffered them­
selves to go without luxury, rather than debase their souls and allow the profane cupidity
of those who tempted them to triumph over their sacred vows by using their wonderful
occult powers for the sole purpose of making money.
The lives of the Great Paracelsus, Cornelius Agrippa, Philalethes, and de Lau­
rence, who has labored twenty years to teach these sacred mysteries to the faithful dis­
ciples., are too. well known to repeat the old sad story.
de Laurence teaches that—“in the inner recesses of the mind is divine prophecy
hidden and confined, a divine impulse, which when developed is called inner or astral
sight."
UNTRAINED MEDIUMSHIP.
“The human soul cannot reflect or realize both earth and spirit life at
the same time; the one vanishes as the other comes into view."
The centuries may mark time, the pendulum of science may swing back and forth,
mysteries may be revealed, records may come and pass, but the world will never know
another de Laurence.
What other has ever taught his disciple the faculty of freeing the astral form from
the bonds of matter? No man can perceive, touch and converse with pure spirit through
any of his bodily senses. Only spirit alone can talk to and see spirit; and even man’s
astral body. is many times too gross, too much tainted yet with earthly affairs to trust
entirely to its perceptions and intuitions.
de Laurence’s works teach how dangerous may often become untrained medium­
ship, and how thoroughly it was understood and provided against by the ancient sages, is
perfectly exemplified in his wonderful writings.
The doctrines taught by this great Master Adept, which has had the attention and
respect of the leading Occult students of the world for over twenty-five years, are only
; gained by the disciple through a regular discipline of gradual initiations and development
of psychical powers.
Under his hand the Chela, (disciple) develops his mystical nature, becomes pure and
immaculate, being liberated from his surrounding vestment, which we denominate body,
and to which the undeveloped are bound.
The body of man—his coat of skin—is an inert mass of matter, per se; it is but the
sentient living body within the man that is considered as the man’s body proper, and it is
that which, together with the fontal soul or purely astral body, directly connected with the
immortal spirit, constitutes the trinity of man.
Whether in the “inner temple,” or through the study of Occultism and Magic, carried
on privately by a regular life of spiritual labor in their own home, de Laurence’s dis­
ciples all obtain practical proof of such divine possibilities that there is no doubt of their
being initiated in those Occult Mysteries, which it is lawful to call the most blessed of all
mysteries, and thereby freed from the molestations of evils here, and, which otherwise
await them in a future period of time.
Likewise, in consequence of this divine Occult Initiation, the student, of The Great
Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic and East Indian Occultism, becomes a spectator
of entire, simple immovable and blessed visions, resident in a pure astral light.
To the candidate, who is faithful and sincere in his study, is revealed the mysteries
of ancient India. These mysteries are in the hands of the Adepts of superior degrees, and
must remain a mystery to the materialistic individual.
Subjective, or spiritual communication with those spirits (souls) who have preceded
us to the silent life beyond the earth, is,.by de Laurence, divided into three categories.
Under the spiritual training laid down in his Volume the disciple or neophyte begins to
feel the presence of spirits around him.
Were he not under the guidance of a superior Adept, like de Laurence, he would
be controlled by invisibles, and utterly at their mercy, for among these subjective influences
the seeker, who is not under the immediate guidance of a Master, is unable to discern the
good from the bad. Happy is the disciple who is sure of the purity of his spiritual
atmosphere.
To this subjective state of consciousness, which is the first degree, is, after a time,
added that of clairaudience.
This is 'the second stage or degree of development.
The disciple—when not naturally made so by psychological, training—now audibly
hears, but still unable to discern; and is incapable of verifying his impressions, and one
who is not properly developed by being trained under a Master Adept is often deluded
with semblances of voices and speech of annoying spirits.

AND SPIRITUAL BOO
This shows that the seeker and student should receive instruction only from a superior
Adept and Master, as this assures a powerful shield against the intrusion of annoying
influences into the consecrated atmosphere of the disciple or neophyte.
The third degree of development is that in which the disciple both feels, hears, and
sees; and when he can produce materialisations at will on the mirror of the astral light.
All this, of course, depends both upon the student and the manner in which he has been
trained and developed.
The student of Spiritualism and Magic will never control the spiritual life principle,
the omnipotent agent of every phenomenon, in the same degree as an Adept of the third
and highest initiation, unless he becomes a disciple of these great Masters whose phe­
nomena, which can be produced at will, do not generally run the market-places in America
and Europe for the satisfaction of open-mouthed investigators.
Of all the duties, the principal one is to acquire the knowledge of the Supreme Soul
(the spirit) ; it is the first of all sciences, for it alone confers on man immortality.
The man who seeks and finds the Supreme Soul (God), in his own soul, as well as
that of all creatures, and who is equally just to all, whether man or animal, obtains the
happiest of all fates, that to be finally absorbed in the bosom of immortality.
The Occultism and Magic, taught by de Laurence, is unlike that taught by the
hair-brained Professors and surface writers of today.
MYSTIC ODORS AND MUSIC.
The phenomena of the mystic odors and music, exhibited by spirits, have been often
observed by those attending circles. We are informed by many who have operated some
of de Laurence’s secret formulae, given in The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu
Magic and East Indian Occultism, that they have heard strains of the most ravishing
music, coming from no visible. instrument, and inhaled a succession of delightful odors
produced, as they believe, by spirit agency.
One correspondent tells us that so powerful was one of these familiar odors—that of
sandal-wood—that the house became impregnated with it for days after.
The medium in this case was a member of a private family, and the experiments were
all made within the domestic circle. Another disciple describes what he calls a "musical
rap."
The potencies that are now capable of producing these phenomena must have existed
and been fully efficacious in the days of Paracelsus.
As to materialized spirits, it suffices to say that they are evoked now in spiritualistic
circles, and guaranteed by scientists, and their evocation by all true seekers is thus made
more probable than ever. It should not be believed that all the spirits that communicate
at circles are of the classes called “Elementals,” and “Elementary” by some writers who
would have you believe them a new-born authority on these matters.
Many spirits—especially among those who control the medium subjectively to speak,
write, and otherwise act in various ways—are human, disembodied spirits. Whether the
majority of such spirits, .are good or bad, largely depends on the private morality of the
medium, much on the circle present, and a great deal on the intensity and object of their
purpose.
If this object is merely to gratify curiosity and to pass the time, it is useless to expect
anything authentic or serious.
But in any case, human spirits can never materialize themselves in propria persona.
These can never appear to the investigator clothed with warm, solid flesh, sweating hands
and faces, and grossly material bodies.
The most they can do is to project their ethereal reflections on the atmospheric waves
of the astral, light, and if the touch of their hands and clothing can become, upon rare
occasions, objective to the senses of a living mortal, it will be felt as a passing breeze
gently sweeping over the touched spot, not as a human hand or material body.
If this is not true, if all the so-called “materialized” forms emerging in darkened rooms
from still darker cabinets, are spirits of men who once lived upon this earth, why such a
difference between them and the spirits that appear unexpectedly—ex abrupto—without
either cabinet .or medium?
Who ever heard of the spirits, unrestful “souls,” hovering about the spots where they
were murdered, or coming back for some other mysterious reason of their own, with
“warm hands” feeling like living flesh, and but that they are known to be dead and buried,
not distinguished from living mortals?
.Never until the beginning, of the era of the dark room, and the dark cabinet “mate-
rializatiens” have we seen spirits appear with warm hands shaking musical instruments and
tambourines.
Genwin® spirit materialiaatiens are always perceived develeping ent of a eleud or
column sf' luminous vapor, and makes itself visible ef its own free will—-in short, an
umbra—it is, and sheuld be, visible but impalpable, or if palpable at all, cammufiicating to

the feeling of touch the sensation of a mass of water suddenly clasped in the hands, or
of condensed or cold steam. It should be luminous and vapory. This luminous vapor
seen by many is the real personal umbra of some spirit, persecuted and earth-bound, either
by its own remorse and crimes or those of another person or spirit. The mysteries of
after-death are deep and many, and the ones best fitted to explain them are Adepts and
Masters of Occultism.
SPIRIT VOICES.
The voices—if such sound can be termed a voice at all—of a disembodied spirit once
heard can hardly be forgotten. That of a pure spirit is like the tremulous murmur of an
zEolian harp echoed from a distance; the voice of a suffering, hence impure, if not utterly
bad spirit, may be assimilated to a human voice issuing from an empty barrel.
This statement. is based upon the practical experience of numberless generations of
Adepts and Theurgists. The testimony of antiquity is positive on this point.
The voices of spirits are not articulated, as they have no physical vocal organs. The
spirit voice consists of a series of sounds which conveys the impression of a column of
compressed air ascending from beneath upward, and spreading around the living inter­
locutor. The many eye-witnesses who testified in the case of Elizabeth Eslinger* namely
the deputy-governor of the prison of Weinsberg, Mayer, Eckhart, Theurer, and Knorr
(sworn evidence), Duttenhofer, and Kapff, the mathematician, testified that they saw the
apparition, or spirit, like a pillar of clouds. For the space of eleven weeks, Doctor Kerner
and his sons, several Lutheran Ministers, the advocate Fraas, the engraver Duttenhofer,
two physicians, Siefer and Sicherer, the judge Heyd, and the Baron Von Hugel, with
many others, followed this manifestation daily.
During the time it lasted, the prisoner Elizabeth prayed, with a loud voice uninter­
ruptedly; therefore, as the “spirit” was talking at the same time, it could be no ventrilo­
quism; and that voice, they say, had nothing human in it; no one could imitate its sounds.
HOW TO ATTRACT DEPARTED LOVED ONES
One of the most powerful attractions of departed loved ones is their strong affection
for those whom they have left on earth. It draws them irresistibly, by degrees, into the
current of Astral Light vibrating between the person sympathetic to them and the
Universal Soul. Another very important condition is harmony, and the magnetic purity
of the medium and the persons present.
If the spiritualists of America and Europe are anxious to keep strictly dogmatic in
their notions of the “spirit world,” they must not set scientists to investigate their phe­
nomena in the true experimental spirit. The attempt would most surely result in a partial
re-discovery of the Magic of old—that of Moses and Paracelsus.
Under the deceptive beauty of some of their apparitions, they might find some day
the Sylphs and fair Undines of the Rosicrucians playing in the currents of psychic and
odic force.
THE SPIRIT OF ANIMALS
The. spirits of dogs, cats, arid various other animals have been repeatedly seen, and the
world-wide testimony is as trust-worthy upon this point as that with respect to human
spirits. We have either to admit that animals have surviving spirits and souls as well as
ourselves, or hold with Porphyry that there are in the invisible world, a particular kind
of tricky and malicious demons, intermediary beings between living men and dis-embodied
“entities,” that delight in appearing under every imaginable shape, beginning with the
human form, and ending with those of multifarious animals.
Before venturing to decide the question whether the spectral animal forms so fre­
quently seen and attested are the returning spirits of dead beasts, we must carefully con­
sider their reported behavior. Do these spectres act according to the habits and display
the same instincts as the animals during life? Do the spectral beasts of prey lie in wait
for victims, and timid animals flee before the presence of man; or do the latter show mal­
evolence and disposition to annoy, quite foreign to their natures? .Many.victims of these
obsessions—notably, the afflicted persons of Salem and other historical witchcrafts—testify
to having seen dogs, cats, pigs, and other animals, entering their rooms, biting them, tramo-
ling upon their sleeping bodies, and talking to them: often inciting them to suicide and other
crimes. In the well-attested case of Elizabeth Eslinger, mentioned by Dr. Kerner, the
spirit of the ancient priest of Wimmenthal was accompanied by a large black.dog, which he
called his father, and which dog in the presence of numerous witnesses jumped on all
the beds of the prisoners. At another time the priest appeared with a lamb, and sometimes
with two lambs. Most of those accused at Salem were charged,by the seeresses with con­
sulting and plotting mischief with yellow birds, which would sit on their shoulder or on
the beams overhead.

SACRED MAGIC.
BY de LAURENCE.
Occult Treasures, Occult Powers and Instructions in Sacred Magic have been buried
and concealed under the centuries of the eternal past, far from the reach of the dizzy
and unsteady hand of the Materialist, who has been wandering in the blind blank faith
of Materialism; who,is neither able to grasp the Seal of Eastern Magic or the great power
that lives within his own self. This wisdom and, certain Teachings, are laid before him
in the many rare books listed in this Catalogue. These teachings are more valuable to
mankind than gold or precious stones and are given with a free hand, including all such
advice and admonition as are necessary for the Disciple and Student to safely enter the
great Sacred Temple of Magic. The veil which has closed for centuries the door which
leads to these things is now drawn aside and, if the student is sincere and wise he will
profit by Occult Teachings which may themselves seem strange and weird as he advances
in the mysteries and Rites of Hindu Magic. A new world and existence will be open to
him and the more he learns of “The Hidden Mysteries’’ the more he will realize and learn
to know himself. The teachings of Art Magic and East Indian Occultism are different
from the teachings of Physiology and Materialism. Materialistic teachings make a man
impotent and a thing that is driven and tossed as a wave of the sea by the storm.
Materialism will have man think that he is an animal. The knowledge of Eastern Wisdom
proves to him that he is a power within himself and, that the invisible powers and forces
are the stronger and predominate and that when he develops this power he will become
invested with a force that will enable him to control his destiny and protect himself and
family as they should be protected by a true father and Master. Materialism teaches man
that Life is not Eternal and that he is to live but a few short years and then be com
demned to Eternal Fire. Hindu Spiritism shows him that he is a pirt of the great
Universe and that he has always existed and shall always continue to exkt.
ART MAGIC.
Art Magic teaches him the true nature of his soul and that his earthly existence is
merely an experience in his Eternal Life and career. The Occult Powers of the soul
which are potentially contained in every man, but understood and developed by few, are
in a sense strange and unknown to the Materialistic Scientists of the Western countries
and who appoints himself the guardian and officer of modern civilization. The learning of
these guardians, who are pleased to call themselves Western Scientists, is far from the
teachings of true Wisdom. Their intellect seeking the small materialistic powers around
them cannot perceive the Occult and Astral Powers above them, nor realize their exist­
ence. Yet, Ancient Wisdom is as old as the mountains of India and has been known and
taught by all prophets and, by every great philosopher that has ever li-ved and inhabited
the earth. The fundamental and cardinal principle as found in ancient Hindu Sanscrit,
and in the Scriptures of the Holy Book form the principle and essence of the power that
Christ taught and revealed unto his Disciples.

In ancient times they were revealed unto those who were found worthy of being
initiated into the Temples of Ancient and Mystic India. The disclosure of Sacred Magic
in these times as in the present to the vulgar was forbidden. These teachings are not
to be confounded with Diabolical Art; for the Arts that are taught by the Western
impostor are like the flickering light of the candle in the face of the Holy Sun. True
Magic is only possessed by those who have developed Spirit Power. This has been verified
by every true and practical Occult Student who has power of intellect and firmness, so
as to enable him to learn and understand these great mysteries which are hidden and
concealed from the unworthy. The above teachings do not merely point out to him the
theories of true knowledge but render him wise and strong in Occult forces. The true
student who studies these teachings and Magical Rites by nature becomes a part of this
light that serves to illuminate and drive out the worms from the deep dark caverns of
the Materialist’s mind and soul. What the Hindu Adept and Master teaches has been
verified and amplified by all of the immortal minds of the past and the Western student
has names to look up to which are famous and which are engraved upon the monumental
steps of the stairway of the past. As written above, this Art in the past as in the future,
will, when once unfolded, teach the secrets to those who will become purified and faithful
in their souls and, as man’s Occult Powers become illuminated, the darkness around him
' (Materialism) will disappear and in its place will come the true light of Wisdom and
knowledge; for once man’s soul has been invested with Occult Powers it becomes free in
its action and movements and he is no longer bound by the cruel bands and cords of
Materialism for the soul then becomes powerful and can and will instruct itself while at
the same time it will be assisted, guided and instructed by Astral Spirits. When this
grand state of Occult Powers becomes developed it becomes its guide. The soul is then
no longer subject to the conditions of time, or materialistic laws. Its existence is eternal
and, for a soul to desire a thing is already to possess it. Man’s ability to advance in these
powers will be in proportion to his desires and true faith. Faith will raise the curtain
and will let Spiritual light penetrate into his soul that it may be able to see and realize
things around him in the Spirit world, the same as if they were Material and External
objects. Man’s soul, once it has developed Spirit Power, becomes one with the spirit.
Man is then able to communicate and converse mentally with mankind and with the spirits
of the Astral Plane the same as if they were living in the physical body. Man is also
able to perform great and mysterious things, for there is a certain kind of Art Magic
which has its existence in the Astral World as taught in “The Great Book of Magical Art,
Hindu Magic and East Indian Occultism. ’ ’
These forces and powers are placed within and not without the soul of man and he
has within himself the power of entering in comimpiieation with these forces by the law
and principle of realization. However, it is a fact that these Invisible Forces (Evil
Spirits) can control a man and break him down with perfect ease, unless he understands
Magical Teachings and how to overcome and dispel their power. He is then able to
dominate instead of being dominated and he can control them so that they will obey him
and understand certain signs.
A man who is not properly developed should understand and always bear in mind
that in trying to demonstrate and work these things for himself, that he is working with a
powerful and unseen force and unless he has the true teachings his efforts will be a curse
■nto him and he would far better be dead than to try these things for the gratification of
his own personal curiosity. Again he will understand that this great power comes from
out of his soul, and that the curse which hangs around the neck of the Western man is
a deficiency of knowledge of himself, because when a man does not know himself he does

C^^lrSELLERS OF OCCUTLTl^^
idAURENCE COMPANY, (hkago.iu.usA
and SPIRITUAL ilOOKS.f
not know and understand the things of the Occult and Invisible world; for how could he,
when he himself is a part of this world and if he has no knowledge of himself how could
he understand the Spirit World. Man must develop the Spirit Power that lies within
himself; it is then, and only then, that he begins to get the knowledge and realization of
the power and forces of the Invisible world.
SPIRITUAL POWER.
Each man is the essence of Spiritual Power and he should know that he possesses
Spiritual Power as well as Physical force; that he possesses one kind of knowledge as
well as another and if he does not find these powers by not applying himself he must not
think that he does not possess them, for he has not proved himself capable or deserving of
their being developed within him. Every man should bear strictly in mind that the growth
or capacity of his soul lies in the extent to which it develops truth and power and not
by basing every conclusion upon External teachings, for as stated in these writings,
Materialistic things are an illusion. The works contained in this Catalogue teach the
student all about Spirits, Dreams and other secret things. They also give valuable knowl­
edge for the one who believes or has some sort of a belief in a future continuation of the
soul. The other person, the writer cares nothing about, as it is not his idea to convert
any man against his will, for he is as welcome to his belief and thought as he is to the
air he breathes as far as he is concerned, because they harm no one but himself and the
true student of Occultism and the true soul who desires to become a recipient of Divine
Light and Sacred teachings pays no attention to the remarks or dictates of the Materialist
because the same are oracle and dogmatic. If such books as “The Great Book of Magical
Art, Hindu Magic and East Indian Occultism,’’—“The Sacred Book of Death, HinduJ
Spiritism, Soul Transition and Soul Reincarnation”—“Magic, White and Black”—“The
Immance of God, Know Thyself”—The Mysteries of Magic;” etc., etc., with their mighty
teachings of wisdom make no impression upon their mind it is only because they fail to
recognize the true light when it shines in their eyes, for True Wisdom and absolute truth
can only come to any man by clear and positive knowledge of them for he cannot receive
and accept these things through Materialistic theories or arguments.
FAMILIAR SPIRITS.
Though it should be an easy matter for you to employ Familiar Spirits to annoy your
neighbor, seek to abstain therefrom, unless it were to repress the insolence of such as
might attempt aught against you personally. Never keep the Familiar Spirits around you
for curiosity, and should you wish to give one over unto any person, see that such person
be distinguished and meritorious, for they love not to serve those of base and common
condition. But should such person unto -whom you give them have made some express
Pact (with Spirits) in such case Familiar Spirits will fly in haste to serve him.

THE TRUE TALISMAN OF HUMAN HAPPINESS.
A personal letter from de Laurence to a friend of his, a faith-
fid disciple in Constellatory Art, Talismanic and Hindu Magic.
My Dear Chela (Disciple),—
KNOWING thee to be a curious searcher after those sciences
which are out of the c nnmon track of study (I mean the Art
of foretelling events, magic, talismans, etc.),
I am moved spiritually to give thee my thoughts upon them,
and by these ideas here written, to open to thine eye (spiritual)
as much information as it seems necessary for thee to know,
by which thou mayest be led by the hand into the delectable
field of nature; and to give thee such documents as my Diploma
and Secret Instruction from “The Great Book Of Magical Art,
Hindu Magic And East Indian Occultism” as, guided by the
supreme wisdom of the Highest, thou mayest refresh thy soul with
a delicious draught of knowledge; so that after recreating thy
spirit with the use of those good gifts which may please my spirit
friends to bestow on thee, thou mayest be wrapped up into the
contemplation of the immense wisdom of that great munificent
Being who created thee.
To enable thee the better to comprehend this Magical Volume,
I have drawn out the various figures, of which mention is made
in this work, that thou mayest see the very exact method of
working; likewise the images of seals, spirits, and various other
rare, and curious instruments, which are necessary for thee to
know and see with the eye; therefore in the construction of them
thou canst not be liable to error.
Now, thou art a man in whose soul the image of Divinity is
sealed for eternity, think first what is thy desire in the searching
after these mysteries! Is it wealth, honor, fame, power, might,
aggrandizement, and the like? Perhaps thy heart says, All! al]
these I would gladly crave!
If so, this is my answer,—seek first to know thyself thor­
oughly, cleanse thy heart from all wicked, vain, and rapacious
desires.
Thinkest thou, oh man! to attain power to gratify thy lusts,
to enrich thy coffers, to build houses, to raise thyself to the pin­
nacle of human admiration; if these are thy hopes and desires,
thou hast reason to lament thy being born: all such desires are
immediately from the spirits of evil, I mean those beings
whose engines (i. e. myriads of evil spirits) are continually in the

act of placing sensual delights and luxuries before the depraved
minds and hearts of men, and whose chief business and property
it is to counteract the benevolent actions and inspirations of those
blessed spirits who are the instruments of Love and Truth.
■ Seek to know Thyself and love thy neighbor, use no deceit,
swear not, neither lie; let all thy actions be sincere. Here, 0 man!
is the grand seal of all earthly wisdom, the true talisman of human
happiness. When thou shalt accomplish this, behold nothing will
be impossible unto thee as far as True Magic permits; then with
all speed apply thy mind and heart to attain knowledge and wis­
dom; with all humility apply thyself to the secret wisdom set
down in “The Great Book Of Magic, Art, Hindu Magic And East
Indian Occultism.”
To know thyself is to know the possibilities of thy soul, for it
is a spiritual gift that enables a man to know himself. This gift
but very few possess, as may be daily seen. How many are there
tossed about to and fro’ upon the perilous sea of contending pas­
sions, and who are more light than feathers! how many in this
great city who place their chiefest good in debauchery and
letchery!
See their actions, manners and dispositions; these poor, un­
fortunate, miserable wretches, such is -thfeir fatal magical infatua­
tion and ignorance, that they think those mad who might even
attempt to reason with them on the vanity and misery of their
situation.
To make myself more intelligible, these are what the world
calls men of fashion, a phrase insignificant enough when we con­
sider that the universal fashion of this time is vice, and that so
glaring, that it needs no great intellect to discover what is daily
open to the view of the observer.
But to you, my friend, I have addressed these lines; therefore
let it not be supposed that I am reprehending my friend for vices
which I cannot suppose him attached to: for I know thou art a
young man designed for the receiving of instruction, in much
higher and more glorious contemplations than those sons of earth
are capable of, therefore I have presented thee with this transla­
tion which thou didst desire me to give thee.
It is necessary for me to inform thee, that whatever thy de­
sires are in the pursuit of this Art, which I call Magic, so wilt
thy connection and answer be.
If in the pursuit of revenge, it is but proper thou shouldest
know that thou wilt, in anv of these experiments here laid down,
draw to thyself a revengeful demon, or an infernal furious spirit,
serving in the principle of the wrath of spirits of evil; if worldly
riches and aggrandizement, then shalt thou have an earthiel or

fiery spirit, which will delude thee with the riches of the central
world; if fame, or the blaze of glory, then the spirit of pride will
be allotted to thee, who will gratify thy inordinate desire of vain
glory; for all these offices are there spirits allotted and will be
eager to mix with thy spirit: it will attract thee to his own nature,
and serve thee all thy purposes according to the extent of thy
desires, and as thy desires are and from what principle they pro­
ceed, so shalt thou be answered: but if thou desirest to know
nothing but for the honor and glory of truth, possibilities from
the Divine, and the help of thy neighbor, and, in great humility,
fill thy heart with the love of thy neighbor, thou shalt then have
a pure spirit which will grant thy desires.
Therefore, seek for that which is good; avoid all evil either in
thought, word, or action; invoking powerful spirits to fill thee
with wisdom, and then thou shalt reap an abundant haiwest.
But beware of flattery, self-love and covetousness, so wilt thou
thrive; and be diligent in thy occupation, so shalt thy body be fed.
Idleness is offensive to the Deity, industry shall sweeten thy
brown bread, and the fruits of it shall warm thine heart, and in­
spire thy soul with gratitude to those forces that bless thee with
enough; seek for no more, for it will damn thee; pray for enough
to feed and clothe thy body, but ask no more, lest thou pine away
in heart-rending poverty, and spend the remainder of thy days
in contumely and beggary.
THE TWO MAGICAL WAYS.
For know a thing most necessary for thee to know, that if by
thy study, by thy art, or any other thing, thou couldst command a
million of spirits, it should not be lawful for thee to wish to gain
riches suddenly, for the Wisdom Eternal has put forth the fiat;
and it has been said by Him who never spoke in vain, and who
cannot lie, that man shall get bread by the sweat of his brow;
therefore let us not have in view the enriching of ourselves in
worldly goods, by supernatural means, or by a greedy desiring
of what we ought to look upon with eyes of contempt, draw a
curse down upon us.
Rather let us cheerfully rely on, and follow in every deed,
spirit and truth, these words of the apostle, “Seek ye first the
kingdom ofjGod within thee, and all these things shall be added
unto you;” fear not for success in Occult and Magical works surely
comes to those who are faithful.
There are two ways Magically set before thee; choose which
thou wilt, thou shalt be sure of thy reward.
Farewell, remember my counsel, and be happy. From thy
friend and Brother in Magic,

THE WITCH OF ENDOR
Invoking The Spiritual Body Of Saul
By L. W. de Laurence
That man is surrounded with invisible beings and that he can communicate with those
who have passed beyond the grave is a belief almost as old as human civilization.
It survives strongly in our present civilized communities, and, although science has
striven at times to kill it with ridicule, recent scientific discoveries have tended to justify
faith in occult phenomena rather than to discourage it.
The Bible gives considerable justification for the belief that it is possible to communi­
cate with the souls of the dead. It tells us that the Witch of Endor called up the spirit
.of Samuel at the request of Saul. We may reason that the witch was an impostor, but the
Bible does not say so. It is probable that this dramatic passage in the Bible has done
more than anything else to preserve the popular belief in spirits, and the possibilities of
communicating with the dead among modern people and especially among Americans.
We must remember that the Bible condemned Saul for seeking to call up the spirit of
Samuel and that disaster came from his daring experiment. Thus an evil reputation has
come to be associated with attempts, to communicate with the dead, and with all those
dealings generally known under the name of “Magic.”
The earliest scientists were Adepts and had dealings with disembodied spirits and
departed beings. The Babylonian and Egyptian priests were the most distinguished of
these practitioners, and yet they undoubtedly made considerable' progress in natural
s'-'erce. These early Oriental priests were above all astronomers and they always mixed
the Occult with their studies of astronomy.
The Arabs were the pioneers of mathematics, the most exact of the sciences, and yet
they were profound believers in Occultism. Evidently the pursuit of science from the
earliest times led a man toward a belief in the occult and invisible world.
Throughout the middle ages the belief in magic, the presence of invisible spirits all
about us, and the possibility of communicating with the dead, persisted. It was strongest
where civilization was most highly developed. Church and State sought to stamp it out,
but without success, perhaps because many of those in authority were the strongest believers
in the Occult.
The brother of King Louis XIV., of France, officially known as “the most Christian
King,” and many members of the court, were discovered to be holding secret orgies with
the spirits of the dead. The King’s relatives and some of the highest personages in the
aristocracy of France were saved by their rank, but those of lesser position were tortured
and executed for their sins. Famous magicians like Johannes Trismegistus lorded it over
whole communities. Sects like the Rosicrucians, practising mysterious rites in secret, in­
cluded the most wealthy and important members, of society.
Some magicians practised the “greater magic," sometimes called “black magic,” that
pretended to accomplish very grave and often evil results, while others practised only “the
lesser or white magic," that was comparatively trivial in its aims.
Modern science, which is said to have begun with Francis Bacon, made from the first
the most serious inroads into the claims of the magicians, astrologers and all other dealers
m the Occult. The phenomena of the magicians would not bear investigation by laboratory
methods in the cold light of day. They were dependent on abnormally sensitive states of
feeling, produced by mysterious surroundings, such as the vault of a graveyard at midnight
or a darkened room in which Temple Incense vias, burned or a red light burning over a
bowl of sacrificial blood. They were a matter of faith, mood.and abnormal perceptions.
The educated classes began to grow sceptical concerning Occultism and commerce
with the spirits. Only the faithful Disciple and persons of an unusually credulous disposi­
tion clung to them. It must be said that the latter were always numerous even in the
highest classes. Queen Marie Antoinette at the end of the eighteenth century fell under
the control of an Adept, and today the Czar of Russia is said to be greatly influenced by a
monk who professes to foresee the future. By the middle of the nineteenth century modern
science had apparently crushed ancient magic and all that went with it. Science had then
reached a state that was most hostile to anything magical or orcult or spiritistic.
But since then an enormous change has taken place. Science has found that there are
methods of communication other than those of cur known senses. Invisible forces can

reproduce the human voice. Messages fly through the air round the world. In fact, every­
thing that the most fantastic magicians pretended to do has been accomplished by the most
matter-of-fact scientists.
The result has been a considerable revival in modern society of a literal acceptance
of the “old magic,” together with an open-minded attitude on the part of serious scientists
toward occult and psychic phenomena. Professors of the ancient magic are going on with
their rituals in Chicago, New York and other world cities, with all the mysterious accom­
paniments of other days, surrounded by a throng of devout initiates. There are even edu­
cated persons who believe that an “elementa” or a disembodied spirit may be reincarnated
with the help of fresh, warm blood.
It was the discovery of electricity that first started the modern mind on its reversion
to the old beliefs. Here is a force that is invisible, intangible, imponderable, and yet is
capable of exerting the most tremendous powers of taking life and destroying every work
of human hands. Here is a power that accomplishes practically everything that had been
claimed by the old magic.
The more the powers of electricity were revealed the more did it appear like a mighty
magician that could accomplish any miracle and send its commands to any part of the
universe. Its various applications strengthened this idea, and to-day it is a commonplace
idea with everybody that we are destined to see endless new uses of electricity.
The telephone was only one of many new inventions that were suggestive of ancient
magic and yet were free from fraud. It is well known that the priests of the Egyptian
temples and other wonder-workers created the most awe-inspiring effects on their followers
by producing a human voice where no person appeared to be. This, of course, is just what
the telephone does, and it has been suggested that some of the ancients may have known the
principle of this invention.
Then came the invention of wireless telegraphy, due largely to the researches of Sir
Oliver Lodge, who has since become the strongest scientific believer in psychic phenomena.
By this use of electricity vibrations are caused to flow completely round the world, carrying
messages without hindrance over mountains, deserts and all natural obstructions. This
was, of course, as great a marvel as any that the ancient magicians ever pretended to
achieve.
Scientific wonders began to come so fast that it would be impossible to catalogue them.
The X-rays, which enable one to see through a solid object, accomplished exactly the same
kind of miracle that is described in “The Arabian Nights.” This discovery was largely
due to Sir William Crookes who most significantly has become like Sir Oliver Lodge, one
of the scientific believers in the possibility of communicating with the dead.
All these discoveries—the electric current, the telephone, the X-rays, wireless teleg­
raphy, all the mysterious, intangible vibrations that are now known to pervade the universe,
have a very obvious relation to the problem of communicating with the dead or with “the
unseen spirits of the air."
Is it not reasonable to argue that the human spirit, which appears to be a form- of
electricity, will continue to exist apart from its gross material body?
Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone and perhaps the most dis­
tinguished of American scientists, has recently stated most interestingly some of the possi­
bilities that arise from the newly-discovered etheric vibrations.
“Many recent scientific discoveries, in my opinion,” he said, “point to a day, not far
distant perhaps, when, men will read one another’s thoughts, when thoughts will be con­
veyed directly from brain to brain without intervention of speech, writing or any of the
present knoivn methods of communication,
“I can imagine, as I have already told the electrical engineers, men with coils of wire
about their heads communicating thought to one another by induction.
“It is a speculation, of course. I cannot fill in all the details at present. If I could, I
should not be simply chatting about it, but would be helping to manufacture apparatus.
A hundred reasons point to the end I have in mind, but there is a large gap to be bridged
over before the end is reached.
“It is not unreasonable to look forward to a time., when we shall see without eyes, hear
without ears, and talk without tongues.
“Speculation of this character has a- legitimate value to science. It may help the indi­
vidual worker to achieve his object, and it stimulates interest and enthusiasm in others.
No man ever made a great scientific discovery without imagining the end to be achieved
before he had worked out the preliminary details.
“Briefly, the hypothesis that mind can communicate directly with mind rests on the
theory that thought or vital force is a form of electrical disturbance, that it can be taken
up by induction and transmitted to a distance either through a wire or simply through the
all-pervading ether, as in the case of wireless telegraph waves.
Continued on next page.

“There are many analogies that suggest that thought is of the nature of an electrical
disturbance. A nerve which is of the same substance as the brain is an excellent con­
ductor of the electric current. When we first passed an electric current through the nerves
of a dead man we were shocked and amazed to see him sit up and move. The electrified
nerves produced contraction of the muscles very much as in life.
“The nerves appear to act upon the muscles very much as the electric current acts
upon an electro-magnet. The current magnetizes a bar of iron placed at right angles to
it and the nerves produce, through the intangible current of vital force that flows through
them, contraction of the muscular fibres that are arranged at right angles to them.
“It would be possible to cite many reasons why thought and vital force may be
regarded as of the same nature as electricity. The electric current is held to be a wave
motion of the ether, the hypothetical substance that fills all space and pervades all sub­
stances. We believe that there must be ether, because without it the electric current could
not pass through a vacuum or sunlight through space. It is reasonable to believe that
only a wave motion of a similar chaTacter can produce the phenomena of thought and vital
force. We may assume that the brain cells act as a battery and that the current produced
flows along the nerves.
“But does it end there, Does it not pass out of the body in waves which flow round
the world unperceived by our senses, just as the wireless waves passed unperceivpd before
Hertz and others discovered their existence?
"This, then, is my thought, that every man is sending out from his mind vibrations of
enormous rapidity and infinitesimal wave-length that pass completely round the earth and
would reveal his thoughts, if there were some way of perceiving them or recording them.
“It is remarkable that nearly all our recent steps in science have had to do with dis­
coveries of new vibrations. Suppose you have the power to make an iron rod vibrate
with any desired frequency in a dark room. At first, when vibrating slowly, its movement
will be indicated by only one sense, that of touch. As soon as the vibrations increase, a
low sound will emanate from it and it will appeal to two senses.
“At about 32,000 vibrations to the second the sound will be loud and shrill, but at
40,000 vibrations it will be silent and its movement will not be perceived by touch. Its
movements will be perceived' by no ordinary human sense.
“From this point up to about 1,500,000 vibrations per second we have no sense that
can appreciate any effect of the intervening vibrations. After that stage is reached its
movement is indicated first by the sense of temperature and then, when the rod becomes
red hot, by the sense of sight. At 3,000,000 it sheds violet light. Above that it passes into
the ultra-violet rays and other invisible radiations, some of which can be perceived by
instruments and employed by us.
“Now, it has occurred to me that there must be a great deal to be learned about the
effect of those vibrations in the great gap where the ordinary human senses are unable to
hear, see or feel the movement.”
While men engaged in natural and applied sciences have made so many discoveries
that border on the miraculous, philosophers and psychologists have begun to form new
conceptions of the human mind and spirit.
What was once known as spiritualism has become psychical research. Scholars and
scientists of the highest position believe either in the possibility of communicating with
the dead, or at least that the phenomena of the subject should be investigated. Dr. James H.
Hyslop gave up his position as a professor of philosophy in Columbia University to devote
his life to this work. William Janies, the most famous of American psychologists, was
inclined toward the end of his life to believe in the possibility of communicating with the
departed.
In fact, the whole world is showing deep interest in what would once have been called
magic or miraculous.
The Bible’s Repeated Assertions Of Satan
And His Occult Forces Of Evil
That there were spirits of evil recognized in Scripture is plainly evidenced, even from
the earliest chapters in the Bible. When evil first makes its entry into the world, tempta­
tion is personified only in the serpent.
There is no'other mention of this personality until the book of Job, where we read of
Satan or the “Adversary.”- Israel in its exile into Babylon had learned something of the
Persian myths of Ormuzd and Ahriman, the conflicting forces for good and evil.

But scholars, claim that Satan in Job is little like Ahriman, for he plays too subordi­
nate a part. It is not until the New Testament that the power and influence of Satan are
brought into bold relief. He is shown first as the ‘‘Tempter’’ of Jesus on the mount, and
then appears all through the Gospels, Epistles and the Apocalypse.
There are comparatively few details in Scripture as to what the theologians call his
“nature" and “original state." In Ephesians ii., 2, he is called “the prince of the power of
the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience." In Matthew xii, 24-26,
he is spoken of as “prince of the devils,” which may be cast out by Jesus, and in Matthew
xxv., 41, as having angels subject to him.
He is believed to exercise his power over mankind either directly or through his
instruments, evil spirits or demons. It is as a leader of a host of bad angels, “fallen from
grace," for whom an everlasting fire is prepared'’ (Matt, xxv., 41), that he most frequently
assaults the righteous. These fallen angels or evil spirits are directly identified with the
“devils” or “demons” who had power to possess or control the souls of men (Matt.
xii., 24-26).
Satan is also called “prince of this world” in John xii., 31, and even “god of this world”
in 2 Cor. iv., 4.
It may be said in summing up the Biblical idea of Satan that: The ultimate and
fundamental truth of angelology and demonology has not been and never can be destroyed
by the march of modern science. 1
The assumption that other superhuman as well as subordinate agencies are at work,
and that some of these are embodiments of evil influence, adds no fundamental difficulty
to those which already exist. . . . Now it is a matter of historic notoriety that some
personalities have lived in this world that might be called incarnations of evil influence.

EVIL SPIRITS AN ENCUMBRANCE
By de Laurence
But not the appearance of super-mundane or sub-mundane spirits are caused by appari­
tions or Astral bodies of suicides or victims cf accidents, nor by the Astral corpses and the
Evestra of the dead; but there are other invisible Spirits that may haunt the houses of
mortals, and may become occasionally visible if the conditions necessary for such a pur­
pose exist. ■ 1
One of these classes is made up of the being called “phantasmata.” These spirits are
"nocturnal spirits,” having reasoning capacities similar to those of man. They seek to
attach themselves to men especially to such as have little power of self-control, and over
whom they may gain power.
There are a great many kinds of such spirits, good as well as evil ones, and they love
to be near man. In this they are comparable to dogs, who are also fond cf the company
of men. But man can profit nothing from their company. They are evil spirits, and are
only an encumbrance to him.
A true and effective power against all evil spirits is believed, as stated above, to be
Coral, backed up by a. firm will.
Again, if we love all the source of all good with all our heart, mind and desire, we may
be sure never to fall Into the power of evil; but priestly ceremony—the sprinkling of water,
and the singing of incantations—'are the inventions of clerical vanity, and they therefore
take their origin from the source of all evil.
CEREMONIES—WERE INSTITUTED ORIGINALLY TO GIVE AN EXTERNAL FORM
TO AN INTERNAL ACT; BUT WHERE THE INTERNAL POWER TO PERFORM SUCH
ACTS DOES NOT EXIST A CEREMONY WILL BE OF NO AVAIL EXCEPT TO ATTRACT
SUCH SPIRITS AS MAY LOVE TO MOCK AT ONE’S FOOLISHNESS.
NOTE—Medieval Occult Literature and that of Modern Spiritualism contain many ex­
amples of Obsession by Evil Spirits, some having appeared visibly and tangibly; others,
though unseen, were felt. T*
Such cases are at the present day much more numerous than is commonly believed, but
they can only “materialize” if the necessary conditions are given. They are therefore only
felt during a state of sickness, when a person is weak; but after the recovery of the patient
they disappear, because they cannot draw the elements necessary for materialization out of
a healthy strong constitution.
NOTE.—They cannot, however, become visible unless they can draw some of the Astral
essence from person or persons in whose presence they desire to appear; in other words,
persons must be mediumists to produce such manifestations of form.
THEY ARE PARASITES DRAWING VITALITY OUT OF THE PERSONS TO WHOM
THEY ARE ATTRACTED, AND THEY MAY EXHAUST THE VITALITY OF THE LATTER
VERY SOON IF SUCH PERSONS ARE NOT VERY STRONG.
EVIL SPIRITS AFTER GETTING CONTROL OVER MEDIUMS, OR OTHERS, ARE
OFTEN INCLINED TO INSTIGATE SUCH MEDIUMISTIC PERSONS TO THE COMMISSION
OF CRIMES AND IMMORALITIES: NEITHER CAN THEY (EVIL SPIRITS) AVOID DOING
SO, BECAUSE BY LOSING THEIR PHYSICAL BODIES WHILE BEING EVIL IN THEIR
SOUL THEY HAVE ALSO LOST THE NECESSARY AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND WILL
POWER TO EXERCISE SELF-CONTROL AND TO EMPLOY' THEIR REASONING FACUL­
TIES FOR GOOD. THEY OFTEN HAUNT THE PLACES WHERE THEY USED TO SPEND
THEIR TIME DURING LIFE.
NOTE.—Books might be filled with reliable accounts of haunted houses, and Instances
in which such evil spirits have been seen are exceedingly numerous. Some people that may
not be able to see them may feel them instinctively cr even physically, like a cold wind or
like a current of electricity passing through the body, thus attempting to find relief from
their burning thirst after the gratification of their desires. Wherever their thoughts attract
them, they will go. If they have committed some crime, they may be bound by repentance
tc that place where it was perpetrated; If they have a treasure buried, care for their money
may hold them there. Hatred or desire for revenge may tie them to their enemies.
NOTE.—CHINAMEN AND HINDOOS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO KILL THEMSELVES
FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVENGE, SO THAT THEIR SOULS MAY CLING TO THEIR
ENEMIES AND TROUBLE THEIR MINDS OR DRIVE THEM TO SUICIDE. IT IS ALSO
WELL PROVEN THAT WARS ARE OFTEN FOLLOWED BY NUMEROUS SUICIDES OC­
CURRING IN THE VICTORIOUS ARMY.
LOVE MAY TURN THEM INTO VAMPIRES, AND CONNECT THEM YVTTH THE OB­
JECT OF THEIR PASSION, PROVIDED THAT THERE ARE SOME ELEMENTS IN THE
LATTER WHICH WILL ATTRACT THEM. BECAUSE THE ASTRAL BODY OF AN EVIL
PERSON CANNOT INFLUENCE THE MIND OF A PURE PERSON, NEITHER DURING
LIFE NOR AFTER DEATH, UNLESS THEY ARE MUTUALLY CONNECTED BY SOME
SIMILARITY IN THEIR MENTAL ORGANIZATION.
NOTE.—Such a case of vampirism is personally known to the writer.
A young man killed himself on account of his passion for a married lady. The latter
Icved him, but did not encourage his advances on account of her matrimonial obligations.
After his death his Astral form became attracted to her, and as she was of a medium-
istic temperament he found the necessary conditions to become partly materialized. It
required a long continued effort until she finally became rid of his spirit.
NOTE.—If our practitioners cf medicine were better acquainted with Occult Facts,
many "mysterious” cases that come under their observation might become clear to them,
and they would soon obtain a deeper insight into some cases cf Obsession, Mania, Hysteria,
Hallucination, etc.
NOTE.—The writer will here give a very good description of seme of the modern spirit-
Materializaticn.
The “Airy Appendix” (Astral Form) usually comes out of the left side of the medium,
in the region of the spleen. Mediums need not necessarily be depraved persons, but there
must be some fault in their organization, else the combination of their principles would be
too strong to part with some of their Astral substance.
Materializing mediums may be very good people, but solitary lives and vicious habits
may lead to the development of such mediumship which may prove very injurious in the end-

INSANITY AND OBSESSION
By de Laurence
EVIL SPIRITS INFLUENCE MEN ACCORDING TO THEIR QUALITIES; THEY WATCH
THEM, INCREASE AND DEEPEN THEIR FAULTS, FIND EXCUSES FOR THEIR MIS­
TAKES, CAUSE THEM TO WISH FOR THE SUCCESS OF EVIL ACTIONS, AND GRADU­
ALLY ABSORB THEIR VITALITY. THEY FORTIFY AND SUPPORT THE IMAGINATION
IN THE OPERATIONS OF SORCERY; THEY SOMETIMES UTTER FALSE PROPHECIES
AND GIVE OUT MISLEADING ORACLES.
Evil Spirits are the lowest creatures in the scale of human beings and they delight in bring­
ing on nervous disorders, insanity, ill-luck, and misfortune as well as breaking down the
human will of men, women, and children. For they are the real devils of the invisible uni­
verse and only make themselves visible to frighten and injure people. In fact, they are the
world’s greatest criminals, and their connection and relation to crime, vice, and sensuality is
a record of horror and misery.
Under certain circumstances, Human Astral Entities or Evil Spirits may become visible
or manifest their presence in some manner.
Evil Spirits may appear in bodily shape, or remain invisible and produce sounds and
noises—such as knocks, laughing, groaning, sighing, and walking. All this may be done by
them for the purpose of calling the attention of the living, so that they may torment,
trouble, or obtain an opportunity to enter into communication with them.
If a man has a strong and evil imagination and wishes to injure another, such Evil
Spirits are always ready to lend a helping hand for the accomplishment of his purpose.
Evil Spirits may render their victims insane, that is those whom they obsess, if the
latter are too weak to resist their influence. A healthy and pure person cannot be obsessed
by them, because such Spirits can only act upon men if the lattei' make room for them in
their minds.
A HEALTHY MIND IS A CASTLE THAT CANNOT BE INVADED WITHOUT THE WILL
OF A MASTER; BUT IF THEY ARE ALLOWED TO ENTER, THEY EXCITE THE PAS­
SIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN; THEY CREATE CRAVINGS IN THEM; THEY PRODUCE
BAD THOUGHTS, WHICH ACT INJURIOUSLY UPON THE BRAIN; THEY SHARPEN THE
ANIMAL INTELLECT AND SUFFOCATE THE MORAL SENSE.
Evil Spirits obsess only those human beings in whom the animal nature is preponderat­
ing. Minds that are illuminated by the Spirit of Truth cannot be possessed. Only those
who are habitually guided by their own lower impulses may become subject to their influ­
ences. Exorcisms and Ceremonies by so-called healers and mediums are useless in such
cases. The wearing of Corals, released by a Master Adept, or abstinence from all thoughts
that may stimulate the imagination or excite the brain are the only true remedies.
But if such Siprits are invisible under moral conditions to a human being, they may
be well enough perceived by a human elementary consciously existing on their plane, and
what is still more, depraved human characters may after death take themselves the forms
of animals and monsters to which they were brought to resemble by their evil thoughts.
Form is nothing but an appearance representing a character and the character shapes
the form. If the character of a person is thoroughly evil, it will cause the Astral form to
assume a hideous form. Therefore the souls of the depraved may appear in animal shapes.
NOTE.—This is confirmed by the writer in his “Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic,
and East Indian Occultism.”
The animal soul of the departed takes the form and shape of that animal whose char­
acter predominated in his constitution.
Pure spirit has no form. It is formless like the sunshine. But as the sunshine causes
the elements of matter to grow into plants, likewise the soul substances may be formed
into beings having shapes, through the action of the spiritual rays.
There are Good Spirits and Spirits of Evil. There are the Spirits of the Four Elements,
and there are many thousand different kinds. There is a never-ending chain of births and
transformations taking place in the world, of causes (spirits) as in the world of effects
(forms).
The lives of seme such entities extend over enormous periods of time; others have only
a short individual existence.
This is the reason that so many things that have been told by Spirits have been proved
lies and illusions, and some Spirits lie a great deal more than others. But it may happen
that perhaps out of a dozen predictions made by such Spirits, cne accidentally comes out
true, and ignorant people will in such cases pay no attention to the fact that the eleven
pFedctions were false, but they will be ready to believe everything that such Spirits may say.
Such spirits often teach those persons whe deal with them to perform certain Cere­
monies, to speak certain words and names in which there is no meaning, and they do all
such things for their own amusement, and to have some sport at the expense of credulous
persons. They are seldom what they pretend to be; they accept names and one will use the
name of another, or they may assume the mask and the ways of acting of another.
If a person has such a Spirit, belonging; to a better class, he may make a good Medium
or Clairvoyant; but one who has a lying Spirit will hear nothing but lies; and on the whole,
all these Spirits surpass each other in deception and lies.
NOTE.—Those who have some experience in modern Spiritualism will recognize the
truth of this statement. Spiritualists should not act upon the advices of Spirits, if such
advices are against their own reason, and Scientists should not rely on the opinion of others
if such opinions are against their own common sense.
Man is an instrument through which all the three worlds, the Spiritual, the Astral and
the Elementary world are acting. In him are beings from all these worlds, reasonable and
unreasonable, intelligent and unintelligent creatures.
A man without any self-knowledge and self-control is made to act according to the
will of these creatures; but the true philosopher acts according to the will of the Supreme,
the Creator, in him, as is taught by de Laurence in The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu
Magic and East Indian Occultism.

WHAT AM I
WHENCE CAME I
WHITHER AM I GOING
A WORD FROM de LAURENCE
The impression, which it is most earnestly de­
sired' to make upon the reader, is the paramount im­
portance of Self-Knowledge, Know Thyself, and the
duty of each individual to seek and develop soul
power. The most important questions to every indi­
vidual are: IFAat am I? Whence came I? Whither
am I going?
The Divine dwells in man, manifesting itself in
various forms, from the crimson cheek of virtuous indignation to the blinding
force of universal truth dawning on the mind. That which is Divine in man is
alone the Power to recognize that which is Divine apart from him.
The Mind Of Man Is Ever Restless
Prone To Err, Small In Its Infinity For Right
No Human soul is born into this “Vale of Tears” (World) a Master of Spirit
Art and for this reason all are obliged to learn, and he who applieth himself
thereunto, and studieth, learneth; and a man can have no more shameful and
evil title than that of being ignorant of his great Occult, and Spiritual Powers.
In the darkness and gloom of Despair and Death the true Disciple of Spirit­
ism sees a Star, for his listening soul hears The Inner Voice Of Revelation, and
his keen Clairvoyant Sight penetrates Death which is the Greatest Mystery Known
to Man. To him the cold face of the Dead smile, and Roses Bloom in the Dark
Valley of Death; for he knows that, even so, man being dead he liveth again and
speaketh unto him from spirit life. The most profound problem of human life,
and the most pitiful and pathetic cry of the human soul throughout all ages, has
been the problem and cry, If a man die shall he live again?
THE OTHER SHORE OF LIFE
There are some, whose spiritual sight is clear, and to whom the other shore
of life is visible. They are able to penetrate the darkness of physical obscurity
and behold, with the inner or spiritual sight, the spiritual world beyond the dark
and troubled waters of earth life. These are the True Masters.
THE MORN OF LAUGHTER AND THE NIGHT OF TEARS
Death closes all the scenes that lie between the MORN OF LAUGHTER
AND THE NIGHT OF TEARS, and where ends the false and true, the joys and
griefs, the careless shallows and thei tragic deeps of universal life.
TO THOSE WHO RECEIVE THIS CATALOGUE
BEING the founder of The de Laurence Co., the largest publishing house
devoted- to Occult, Spiritual And Magical Books, as well as all Secret Occult
Accessories, I can speak with authority as to the merits of the many famous
VOLUMES listed in this Great Catalogue which has been published at a vast
'C expense. The purpose of the books listed will be greatly misjudged should
their teachings be construed as an unqualified onslaught upon the doctrines of
v any church or people. Both Seership And Inspiration are, by many famous
authors, affirmed and emphasized as predicable of the biblical writings, but not indis­
criminately.
Books in this Catalogue, really teach True Magic, And True Magic consists in True
Faith; but True Faith rests in Spiritual Knowledge, and without this kind of knowledge
there can be no Faith; this is only obtained by developing one’s inner and most lofty nature.

PENALTY OF LEADERSHIP
IN OCCULTISM
In. every field of human endeavor, he that is first must per­
petually live in the white light of publicity. Whether the leader­
ship be vested in a man, or his books and his writings, emulation
and envy are ever at work.
In art, in literature, in music, in industry, the reward and the
punishment are always the same.
The reward for an author and teacher, who by hard work has
become a Master in his particular field of labor, is fame and wide­
spread recognition; the punishment, fierce denial and detraction.
When a writer’s books, and his teachings, become a standard
for the whole world, they also become a target for the shafts of
the envious few. If his works be merely mediocre, he will be left
severely alone—if he achieves a masterpiece, it will set a million
tongues a-wagging.
The leader is assailed because he is a leader, and the effort to
equal him is merely added proof of that leadership. Failing to
equal or to excel, the follower seeks to depreciate and to destroy
—but only confirms once more the superiority of that which he
strives to supplant.
There is nothing new in this. It is as old as the world and as
old as the human passions—envy, fear, greed, ambition, and the
desire to surpass.
And it all avails nothing.
If de Laurence, by his books, and the principle he enunciates
truly leads, he remains—the leader.
That which is good or great makes itself known, no matter
how loud the clamor of denial.

ATTRACTING ATTENTION BY FAKE ADVERTISING
de Laurence Says: It is more commendable to set a just price on a book, or an article you know
to be good, than to be so deceitful as to sell at any price a thing you know to be worthless; or to pre­
tend to give away something for nothing, with the sole object of attracting attention by fake advertis­

“A BOOK THAT LIVES”
The Great Book Of Magical
Art, Hindu Magic And East Indian
Occultism Is Now Combined With The Book
Of Secret Hindu, Ceremonial And Talismanic Magic
TEACHES EVERY PHASE OF MYSTIC POWER
A 'Veritable Literary Macrocosm. The combining of these Two Grand
Books is one of the greatest achievements of Occult and Spiritual literature of
the present age. Their having been published and bound into ONE GREAT
BOOK, The Occult and Esoteric teachings of the world put into One Large
Handsome Volume. "THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU
MAGIC AND EAST INDIAN OCCULTISM,” when published by itself used to
sell at $25.00. "THE BOOK OF SECRET HINDU, CEREMONIAL, AND
TALISMANIC MAGIC,” was, heretofore, always privately printed by de Laur­
ence and sold only to his Personal Students for $2 5.00. As will be seen the price
of these Two Wonderful Books, when published and sold separately, was $25.00
for the one, and $25.00 for the other; making a total of $50.00 for the two.
Now that these Two Noted Books have been Combined and published in ONE
LARGE VOLUME the price is very much less,

“ALL THINGS TO ALL MEN”
An Advanced Occult Student Writes:
"The Neu> Fourteenth Revised Edition, of
The Great Book Of Magical Art, Hindu
Magic And East Indian Occultism, is the
only treatise on these subjects that any man
should have on the shelf of his Occult library.
I have waited for it since the last Edition was
issued, steadily refusing to purchase any other,
and my anticipations have been exceeded for the Revised 1915 Edition,
with two hundred pages of text matter, and some sixty full pages illus­
trations added, is "all things to all men.”
A Leading Spiritualist Writes:
"My deepest satisfaction in owning this
grand Volume is the surety that what I do not
know lies between its covers, to be reached easily,
when I am ready to master it.”
"The Great Book Of Magical Art,
Hindu Magic And East Indian Occultism,” was first published over
25 years ago, and during the intervening years, no author has ever dared to
attempt to cover the same ground.

Propelling Astral Body
Hindu Magic And Mediumship
Beginning on page 363 of “THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART,
HINDU MAGIC, AND EAST INDIAN OCCULTISM,” de Laurence, the
Greatest Occultist and Adept of this age, teaches, by a series of lessons,
Adeptship, Clairvoyance, Hindu Magic, And Mediumship. These wonderful
Lessons as set forth by this Great Master in his famous book, begin on
page 363.
Hie earliest cradle of our race and civilization, India, still holds the Key
to many Occult Mysteries. In the shade of its palm groves, in the depth of its
jungles, in the wild recesses of its mountains, and behind the walls of its
Temples there is many an Occult and Magical Secret which has never before
been printed or given to the public until these lessons appeared on the pages
of “THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC, AND EAST
INDIAN OCCULTISM.”
Those who have ordered this wonderful book have been amply rewarded,
because the book itself contains over 600 pages. It is a large Massive Volume
and really teaches you everything you want to learn. Gives information on
every Occult subject. It teaches, it explains, it tells you plainly just what to
do, when to do it, and how to do it in order to reach the highest degree in
Spiritual Development and Adeptship. Tells of the wonderful efficacy of
Talisman Rings made for dreams and Spiritual as well as Material protection.
Gives Tables for the Invocation and Convocation of Spirits. Tells you how to
use and burn Incense, Perfumes, Unguents, all compounded according to the
Nature of the Spirit you wish to invoke. Tells you how to defend yourself
against Evil Spirits and Scepters.
Study this wonderful book. Obtain the Psychometric Key to all legiti­
mate Knowledge, Wisdom, Seership and Occult Mastery of being, so that you
can take your place in the Mighty Brotherhood of the Illuminati and Hiero­
phants of the ages, the twice-born Sons of God and Brothers of Christ. Don’t
overlook the marvelous results to be gained by studying “THE GREAT BOOK
OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC, AND EAST INDIAN OCCULTISM.”
Always remember that the Adepts in Oriental Occultism are the real custodians
of Occult Secrets for which many a University man would readily exchange
twenty years of his life, Secrets, Mysteries which so far have successfully baffled
the researches of the best Western thinkers, and which not only enabled the
possessor to suspend or defy the ordinary “laws of nature,” but to triumph
over time and space with an ease and readiness which the Greeks hardly dared
to attribute to their Olympian gods.
There are among the Adepts men of vast mental caliber, Philosophers in
the highest sense, men whose society is coveted by the foremost Hindoo
scholars and who bear the stamp of genius in their countenances. But they
are rare exceptions, like everything else that is great and noble in this sor­
rowful world.

INVOKING SOULS OF THE DEAD
Strange Experience Of A Favorite Student
From the earliest times men have endeavored to get in touch with the Spirits
of the Unseen World. From the earliest times Masters of Occultism have formu­
lated Ceremonial Rites to call to their aid Spirit Powers—sometimes for good and
often for evil. One of the best known modern Mystics, who is at present in India,
is a Frenchman, who, having been a life-long Disciple of de Laurence’s, went to
India to be admitted to those Eastern Orders Of Sacred Mysteries, to which de
Laurence himself belongs. For a long time this Frenchman studied under his
Master in the United States; but from time to time he would disappear, only to
appear again in Egypt or India on some secret mission for de Laurence. To him
a long journey, under the direction of de Laurence, is an achievement, a satisfying
thing in itself, like the hidden knowledge which he has so faithfully searched for.
He explored Egypt without guides of any kind. Later he spent four years in
Northern India at a certain Occult Temple under the guidance of de Laurence.
His success, after he returned to the United States, in curing serious diseases and
cases of Obsession, was phenomenal. The most important part of this Mystic’s
Occult education, given him by de Laurence, was the instructions for the Exorcis­
ing of Evil Obsessing Spirits
* (see foot note below) and to prevent them from
Returning. It is well known that de Laurence’s knowledge is based on his own
practical experience as an Adept and an Exorcist, covering a period of more than
Forty years, de Laurence, and this favorite student of his, during their travels
throughout the world have cast out Evil Spirits and relieved many cases of Obses­
sion.
*An abundance of evidence is produced to show that EVIL OBSESSING Spirits seem
to take the same delight in torturing a child till it dies, or in annoying a pure girl till she
becomes insane, or in tormenting a man till he murders his sweetheart and kills himself,
ps the good spirits do in shedding their benign influence and protecting care over those
they i-oo-ard nq worthy thoir assistance And it may aurpHae many peraona tn
learn that their most bitter enemy may return as an OBSESSING SPIRIT after death, and
cause more trouble and distress than he ever did during life.
As a silent Chela, this Frenchman says, he has sat for days within his Temple,
never moving leg nor arm, so that he might have revealed to him the Occult
Powers of the Universe and have his Inner Spiritual Vision opened so he could
read in The Astral Light at will. He devoted much time, he says, to the art of
Materializing the Spirit Forms of those whom he wished to communicate with
in the Spiritual World. This is accomplished, so he states, by the aid of de
Laurence’s Master’s Incense, for Invocations and of Rituals taken from “THE
GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC AND EAST INDIAN
OCCULTISM.” By de Laurence.
Speaking of Occultism and the Power of Unseen Forces, this learned student
of de Laurence’s recently said that his knowledge of the Occult has amazed both
himself and his friends beyond expression. Indeed, he says: “I Evoke a Spirit by a
Special Ceremonial Rite. I work for a given result and do not, like Spiritualists,
wait for some wandering spirit to turn up, or become a slave of any spirit which hap­
pens to come around claiming to be my Guide.”
In “THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC AND EAST INDIAN
OCCULTISM” the student is taught how to make his Magic Circle, and once within
his Circle the student is Master. The spirits Must Obey.
“It was in New York that two of us, myself and another of de Laurence’s Dis­
ciples of high rank, decided to Evoke a particular Spirit. We performed no blood
sacrifice. It is not necessary to shed blood if you use de Laurence’s Master’s Incense,
for the Spirit you want should Materialize while it is burning.
“Around the Altar we had traced a large Circle, ample in size to hold us both.
And then, following the Occult Rites, as taught by de Laurence, we consecrated the
Altar and the Circle itself. So long as we remained inside the Circle, no Spirit could
harm us. Being thus secured, we Conjured the Spirit we desired to have come to us.
“As the smoke arose from the Incense in the Burner we lifted up our voices
and Invoked the Spirit. And then, as we felt Occult Powers within us grow, we com­
manded that the Spirit come forth.
“All at once from out of the smoke of the burning Incense there slowly arose a
Spiritual Form which answered any question we asked and Prophesied certain things
which have since come to pass,”

THE HINDU BOOKS OF INITIATION
HE mysteries taught in The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic
and East Indian Occultism are as old as the world, and one well
versed in the esoteric mythologies of various Oriental nations can trace
them back to the days of the anti-l7edic period of India.
Every approach to the Occult Mysteries, of all Oriental nations, has
been guarded with the same jealous care; as all initiates, of any degree,
dared not divulge the secrets entrusted to them. This was the case in
the Eleusinian and Bacchic Mysteries, among the Chaldean Magic, and
the Egyptians hierophants; while with the Hindus, from which they
were all derived, the same rules have prevailed from time immemorial
until de Laurence received the exclusive right to train sincere Occult students.
In the Hindu books of initiation we find that any initiate of the first degree (the
lowest) who betrays the secrets of his initiation, to members of other castes, for whom
the science is a closed book, must have “his tongue cut out,” and suffer other humiliations.
“No one who is not bound to his Master and teacher by friendship and communion
with the unseen world, can be initiated into the Occult Mysteries of the Adepts,” says the
Hindu books of initiation.
SPIRITUAL PHENOMENA AND MEDIUMSHIP.
It is permissible to assume that one country, owing to its less propitious climate, and
the magnetism of the average population being too positive to call forth independent spiri­
tual phenomena, may not experience these things and therefore be full of skepticism.
On the other hand, neither Protestant Germany, nor England, nor yet in America,
since the days of the Reformation, has the clergy had access to any of the Vatican secret
libraries. Hence they are all but poor hands at the Magic miracles of the Master Jesus.
The United States is overflowing with sensitives, and mediums; the reason for it is
partially attributable to climatic influence and especially to the physiological condition of
the population. Since the days of the Salem witchcraft, 200 years ago, when the com­
paratively few settlers had pure and unadulterated blood in their veins, nothing much had
been heard of “spirits" or “mediums” until 1840. The phenomena then first appeared
among the ascetic and exalted Shakers, whose religious aspirations, peculiar mode of life,
moral purity, and physical chastity all led to the production of independent phenomena of a
psychological as well as physical nature. Hundreds of thousands, and even millions of
men from various climates and of different constitutions and habits, have, since 1692.
invaded North America, and by intermarrying have substantially changed the physical
type of the inhabitants. Of what country in the world do the women’s constitutions bear
comparison with the delicate, nervous, and sensitive constitutions of the feminine portion
of the population of the United States? We were struck on our arrival in the country
with the semi-transparent delicacy of skin of the natives of both sexes. Compare a hard­
working Irish factory girl or boy, with one from a genuine American family. Look at
their hands.
One works as hard as the other; they are of equal age, and both seemingly healthy;
and still, while the hands of the one, after an hour’s soaping, will show a skin little softer
than that of a young alligator, those of the other, notwithstanding constant use, will allow
you to observe the circulation of the blood under the tnin and delicate epidermis. No
wonder, then, that while America is the conservatory of sensitives the majority of its
clergy unable to produce divine or any other miracles, stoutly deny the possibility of any
phenomena except those produced by tricks and juggling. And no wonder also that the
Catholic priesthood, who are practically aware of the existence of Magic and spiritual
phenomena, and believe in them while dreading their consequenses, try to attribute the
Whole to the agency of the Devil.

ANP SPIRITUAL BOOKS
SPIRITUAL MANIFESTATIONS.
As for materializations, they are many and various in the sacred records of the Bible.
But, were they affected under the same conditions as at modern seances? Darkness, it
appears, was not required in those days of patriarchs and Magic powers. The three angels
who appeared to Abraham drank in the full blaze of the sun, for “he sat in the tent-door
in the heat of the day,” says the book of Genesis. The spirits of Elias and Moses appeared
equally in daytime, as it is not probable that Christ and the Apostles would be climbing a
high mountain during the night. Jesus is represented as having appeared to Mary Mag­
dalene in the garden in the early morning; to the Apostles, at three distinct times, and
generally by day; once “when the morning was come” (John, xx., 4). Even when the ass
of Balaam saw the “materialized” angel, it was in the full light of noon.
All are fully' prepared to agree with de Laurence, that they find in the life of
Christ—and we may add in the Old Testament, too—“an uninterrupted record of spiritual­
istic manifestations,” but nothing mediumistic, of a physical character though, if we except
the visit of Saul to Sedecla, the Obeah woman of En-Dor. This is a distinction of vital
importance.
True, the promise of the Master was clearly stated; “Aye, and greater works than
these shall ye do”—works of mediatorship. According to Joel, the time would come when
there would be an outpouring of the divine spirit: "Your sons and your daughters” says
he, “shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.”
The time has come and they do all these things now; Spiritualism has its seers and;
martyrs, its prophets and healers. Like Moses, and David, and Jehoram, there are me-(
diums who have direct writings from genuine planetary and human spirits; and the best'
of it brings the mediums no pecuniary recompense.
There are a few, a very few, orators on the spiritualistic platform who speak by
inspiration, and if they know what is said at all they are in the condition described by
Daniel; “And I retained no strength. Yet heard I the voice of his words: And when I
heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep.” (Daniel, x., 8.)
And there are mediums, those whom we have spoken of, for whom the prophecy in
Samuel might have been written: “The spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, thou shalt
prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.” (Samuel, x., 6.)
“But where, in the long line of Bible wonders, de we read of flying guitars, and
tinkling tambourines, and jangling bells being offered in pitch-dark rooms as evidences
of immortality? These foolish things are only found among the impostures and spurious
mediums of United States and England.
When Christ was accused of casting out' devils by the power of Beelzebub, he denied it,
and sharply retorted by asking, “By whom do your sons of disciples cast them out?”
Again, spiritualists affirm that Jesus was a medium, that he was controlled by one or many
spirits; but when the charge was made to him direct he said that he was nothing of the
kind. “Say we not well, that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?”: daimonion, and
Obeah, or familiar spirit in the Hebrew text. Jesus answered, “I have not a devil.”
(Gospel according to John VII. 20.)
Many writers attempt a parallel between the aerial flights of Philip and Ezekiel and
of Mrs. Gupply and other modern mediums. They are ignorant or oblivious of the fact
that while levitation occurred as an effect in both classes of cases, the producing causes
were totally dissimilar. Levitation, raising a human body in the air without material means
or support, may be produced consciously or unconsciously to the subject as taught in that
wonderful book, “INDIA’S HOOD UNVEILED,”
The Adept determines beforehand that he will be levitated, for how long a time, and
to what height; he regulates the Occult forces accordingly. The disciple of Hindu Occult­
ism produces the same effect and except when in the ecstatic state, keeps control
over his movements. So do the priests of Siam, when, in the sacred pagoda, he
mounts fifty feet in the air with taper in hand, and flits from idol to idol, lighting up the
niches, self-supported, and stepping as confidently as though he were upon solid ground.
This, persons have seen and testified to. The officers of the Russian squadron, which
recently circumnavigated the globe, and was stationed for a long time in Japanese_ waters,
relate the fact that, besides many other marvels, they saw priests walk in mid-air from
tree-top to tree-top, without the slightest support. They also saw the pole and tape­
climbing feats, described by Colonel Olcott in his People from the Other World, and
which have been so much called in question by certain spiritualists and mediums whose zeal
is greater than their learning. The quotations from Col. Yule, de Laurence, and other
eminent writers seem to place the matter beyond doubt that these effects are produced.

HERMES, LEVI, PARACELSUS, de LAURENCE
The Grand Truths Of Occultism demand only
to be found, when anyone will be able to compre-
hend them. This book brings the student in direct
contact with Occult secrets, and opens the way to
II1j many strange and wonderful powers. The "KEY”
to Occult Sciences has in the past been practically
lost except to those great Masters such as HERMES,
JACOB BOEHME, LEVI, PARACELSUS, and de LAURENCE.
Occultism is the one science which is coeval with creation itself;
it is the "Key” to all Miracles, and to almost Omnipotent Adept­
ship. As regards the Philosophical side of Occultism; its great
doctrine is equilibrium; equilibrium between Church and State;
its great hypothesis is analogy; while in the moral sense equilibrium
is the concurrence of Science and Faith.

TO THE FAITHFUL AND DISCREET DISCIPLE OF
WISDOM.
BY de LAURENCE.
In “The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic and East Indian Occultism,”
which I have written chiefly for the information of those wflio are guileless and inde­
fatigable in their enquiries into Spiritism and Indian Occultism, I have, at vast labor
and expense, both of time and charges, collected whatsoever can be deemed valuable
and rare, in regard to the subject of Hindu and Natural Magic, Indian Occultism—the
Cabala—Celestial and Ceremonial Magic—Alchemy—and Spiritism; and have divided it
into TWO BOOKS, sub-divided into parts: to which I have added a biographical account
of those great men who were famous and renowned for their knowledge; showing upon
whose authority this Science of Occultism and Magic is founded, and upon what prin­
ciples. To which I have annexed a great variety of notes, wherein I have impartially
examined the probability of the existence of Magic, both of the good and bad species,
in the earliest, as well as in the latter, ages of the world. I have exhibited .a vast
number of rare experiments in the course of this Treatise, many of which, delivered in
the beginning, are founded upon the simple application of actives to passives; the others
are of a higher Astral Influence.
In my history of the lives of Hindu Adepts, Philosophers, Alchemists, etc., I have
omitted nothing that can be called interestipg or satisfactory. I have taken my his­
torical characters from those Adepts, Great Masters and Philosophers, most deserving
of credit; I have given an outline of the various reports tradition gives of them; to
which are annexed notes, drawn from the most probable appearance of truth, impartially
describing their characters and actions; leaning neither to the side of those who doubt
everything, nor to them whose credulity takes in every report to be circumstantially true.
At this time, Hindu Magic, Indian Occultism and Spiritism are more investigated
than for a century past, during which space they have been almost totally neglected;
but men becoming more enlightened, they begin to consider the extraordinary effects
that were wrought by ancient philosophers, in ages that were called dark. Many,
therefore, have thought that time, nature, causes, and effects, being the same, with
the additional improvements of mechanical and liberal arts, we may, with their knowl­
edge of Nature, surpass them in the producing of wonderful effects; for which cause
many men are naturally impelled, without education or other advantage, to dive into
the contemplation of Spiritism, Hindu Magic and Indian Occultism; but the study
thereof being at first difficult, they have recourse to lay out a great deal of money in
collecting various books; to remedy this inconvenience and expense, I have at an enor­
mous cost published The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic and East Indian
Occultism, presuming that my labors therein will meet with the general approbation
of either the student or disciple: for whose use and instruction it is now published.
But to return to the subject of this Book; I have, in the Hirst Part, fully explained
what Natural Magic is; and have shown that, by the application of actives to passives,
many wonderful occult effects are produced that are merely natural, and done by
manual operations. I have procured every thing that was valuable and scarce respecting
this department of my work, which I have introduced under the title of Natural Magic;
and a variety of my own experiments likewise. In the possession of this work, the

laborious and diligeht student will find a complete and delectable companion; so that
he who has been searching for years, for this author and the other, will in this Volume
find the marrow of them all.
But I would advise, that thee do not depend too much upon thy own wisdom in
the understanding of these mysteries; for all earthly wisdom is foolishness in the esteem
of the true Adept—I mean all the wisdom of man, which he pretends to draw from any
other source than the spiritual alone.
SECOND PAET OF THE FIEST BOOK.
In the study of this Volume you come next to the Second Part of the First Book,
treating of the Art called the Constellatory Practice, or Talismanic Magic; in -which
I fully demonstrate the power and efficiency of Talismans and Charms, so much talked
of, and so little understood by most men: I therefore explain, in the clearest and most
intelligible manner, how Talismans, Charms and Amulets may be made for the execution
of various purposes, and by what means, and from what source they become vivified, and
are visible instruments of great and wonderful effects. I likewise show the proper and
convenient times; under what constellations and aspects of the planets Talismans, Amulets
and Charms are to be formed, and the times when they are most powerful to act; and,
in the next place, I have taught that our own spirit is the vehicle of celestial attraction,
transferring celestial and spiritual virtue into Seals, Images, Amulets, Rings, Papers,
Glasses, &c. Also, I have not forgot to give the most clear and rational illustration of
sympathy and antipathy—attraction and repulsion. I have likewise proved how cures are
performed by virtue of sympathetic pow’ers and medicines—by seals, rings, and amulets,
even at unlimited distances, which I have been witness of and am daily confirmed in
the true and certain belief of. I know how to communicate with any person, and to
give him intimation of my purpose, at a hundred or a thousand miles distance; but then
a preparation is necessary, and the parties should have their appointed seasons and
hours for that purpose; likewise, both should be of the same firm constancy of mind, and
a disciple or brother in art. There is also given methods whereby a man may receive
true and certain intimation of future things (by dreams), of whatsoever his mind has
before meditated upon, himself being properly disposed. Likewise, there is recited the
various methods used by the Hindu Adepts and Yoghees for the invocation of astral
spirits, by circles, crystals, &c.; their forms of exorcism, incantations, orations, bonds,
conjurations; and have given a general display of the instruments of their Art; to all
of which I have subjoined notes, endeavoring to point out the difference of these Arts,
so as to free the name of Magic from any scandalous imputation; seeing it is a word
originally significative not of any evil, but of every good and laudable science, such as a
man might profit by, and become both wise and happy; and the practice so far from
being offensive to woman or man, that the very root.or ground of all Magic takes its
rise from the Holy Scriptures, Viz.—“The fear of God is the beginning of all wisdom;”—
and charity is the end: which fear of Go'd is the beginning of Magic; for Magic is
wisdom, and on this account the wise men were called Magi. The Magicians were the
first Christians; for, by their high and excellent knowledge they knew that that Saviour
which was promised, was now born man—that Christ was our Redeemer, Advocate, and
Mediator; they were the first to acknowledge his glory and majesty; therefore let no one
be offended at the venerable and sacred title of Magician—a title which every wise man
merits while he pursues that path which Christ himself1 trod, viz., humility, charity,
mercy, fasting, praying, &c.; for the true Magician is the truest Christian, and nearest
disciple of Jesus the Adept, who set the example we ought to follow; for he says—“If

ye have faith, &c.;” and “This comes not by fasting and prayer, &c.;” and “Ye shall
tread upon scorpions, &c.;” and again “Be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.’’—
Such instructions as these are frequently named, and given in many places of the sayings
of Christ. Likewise, all his disciples confess the power of working miracles through faith
in the name of Jesus Christ, and that all wisdom is to be attained through him; for ha
says, “I am the light of the world!”
OF OCCULT BINDING.
In “The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic and East Indian Occultism” I have
taught everything concerning the great virtues, and wonderful efficacy, of Natural Things;
it remains now that this very same Volume also fully teaches a wonderful Power and
Faculty of Fascination; or, more properly, a Magical and Occult Binding of men into love
or hatred, sickness or health;—also the binding of thieves, that they cannot steal in any
place; or to bind them that they cannot remove, from whence they may be detected;—the
binding of merchants that they cannot buy nor sell; the binding of an army, that .they
cannot pass over any bounds; the binding of ships so that no wind, though ever so strong,
shall be able to carry them out of that harbor!—the binding of a mill, that it cannot, by
any means whatsoever, be turned to work;—the binding of a cistern, or fountain, that the
water cannot be drawn up out of them;—the binding of the ground, so that nothing will
bring forth fruit, or flourish in it; also, that nothing can be built upon it;—the binding of
fire, that, though it be ever so strong, it shall burn no combustible thing that is put to
it;—also, the binding of lightnings and tempests, that they shall do no hurt;—the binding
of dogs that they cannot bark;—also, the binding of birds and wild beasts, that they shall
not be able to run or fly away; and things familiar to these, which are hardly creditable,
yet known by experience. Nor how it is that these kind of bindings are made and brought
to pass, we must know. They are thus done: by sorceries, collyries, unguents, potions,
binding to and hanging up of talismans, by charms, incantations, strong imaginations,
affections, passion, images, characters, enchantments, imprecations, lights, and by sounds,
numbers, words, names, invocations, swearings, conjurations, consecrations, and the like.
AU of which, and a great deal more, is contained in This Great Book.
Sorceries. The force of Sorceries are so very, very powerful; indeed, they are able
to confound, subvert, consume, and change all inferior things; likewise there are sorceries
by which we can suspend the faculties of men and beasts.
However, should you be interested in thestf and many other strange things, and, like­
wise wish to possess the true knowledge of their workings, you cannot obtain them other­
wise than by studying The Great Book of Magic Art, Hindu Magic and East Indian
Occultism.
THE POWER OF NUMBERS.
I have thought it advisable, likewise, to investigate the power of numbers, their
sympathy with certain Astral powers; and, seeing the whole universe was created by
number, weight, and measure, there is no small efficacy in numbers. Because nothing more
clearly represents the Divine Essence to human understanding than numbers; seeing that
in all the Divine holy names there is still a conformity of numbers, so that the conclusion
of this Second Part Of The First Book forms a complete system of Mathematical Magic;
in which I have collected a vast number of secret Seals from the famous Hindu Masters,
and likewise from my Brother Adepts, noting them particularly, I have found them corre­
spondent with true science on experiment.

THE SECOND BOOK.
The Second Book, contained in The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic And
East Indian Occultism, forms a complete treatise on the mysteries of the Cabala and
Ceremonial Magic; by the study of which, a man (who can separate himself from material
objects, by the mortification of the sensual appetite—abstinence from drunkenness, glut­
tony, and other bestial passions, and who lives pure and temperate, free from those
actions which degenerate a man to a brute) may become a recipient of Divine light and
knowledge; by which he may foresee things to come, whether to private families, or
kingdoms, or states, empires, battles, victories, &c.; and likewise be capable of doing much
good to his fellow-creatures: such as the healing of all disorders, and assisting with the
comforts of life the unfortunate and distressed.
I have spoken largely of prophetic dreams and visions in my Cabalistic Magic, and
have given the tables of the Cabals, fully set down for the information of the wise; some
few most secret and terrible things being reserved for my personal pupils only, not to be
taught by publication, nor by letters, but only by word of mouth to those who come and
see me in person.
The wonders of Animal Magic I have fully displayed under the title of Magnetism,
so as to show by what means, instruments, and effects, you must apply actives to passives,
to the producing of rare and uncommon effects; whether by actions, amulets, allegations
and suspensions—or rings, papers, unctions, sufiumigations, sorceries, allurements, enchant­
ments, images, lights, sounds, or the like.
This Book gives a complete Magical Biography, which has been the result of much
labor in acquiring. Therefore, those who wish to benefit in these Magical studies, must
shake off the drowsiness of worldly vanity, all idle levity, sloth, intemperance, and lust;
so that they may be quite clean, pure, and free from every distraction and perturbation
of mind, and worthily use the knowledge obtained from this Volume of learning and
their own labors.
Therefore, my good friend, whosoever thou art, that desirest to accomplish these
things, be but persuaded first to apply thyself to the Eternal Wisdom taught in my work
that it may grant thee understanding, then seeking knowledge with diligence, and thou
shalt never repent thy having taken so laudable a resolution, but thou shalt enjoy a
secret power, happiness and serenity, of mind, which the world can never rob thee of.
Wishing thee every success imaginable in thy studies and experiments, hoping that
thou wilt use the benefits that thou mayest receive to the honor of our Creator and my
Brother Adepts both in Spirit and Earth Life who have so ably assisted me in placing
this Great Work before thee my friend and, for the benefit of thy neighbour, in which
exercise thou shalt ever experience the satisfaction of doing thy duty. Should you ever
be so fortunate as to obtain a copy of The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic and
East Indian Occultism, remember my instructions—to be silent; talk only with those
worthy of thy communications—do not give pearls to swine; be friendly to all, but not
familiar with all; for many are, as you well know—wolves in sheep’s clothing.

AND SPIRITUAL BOOKS
THE GENUINE SYSTEM.
BY de LAURENCE.
The Genuine System and Method of Hindu Magic, Spirit Invocation and Occultism,
both Ancient and Oriental, advocated and taught, in these books listed in this Cata­
logue which treat on these subjects is the Hindu manner of Teaching, which of course,
makes it ancient and unique. In OCCULTISM and Art Magic, that is to say, the
Science, Power and Knowledge of the Secret control of the Spiritual Forces of the
Astral World, there have always been two different schools, the one Great in Good,
the other strong in Evil, as referred to in The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic
and East Indian Occultism. The former depends on the Knowledge and Invocation of
Good Spirits; the latter on the peculiar method of Invocation of Evil Spirits. The former
is termed Sacred or True Magic as opposed to the latter, or Black Art. The Invocation
of Good and Friendly Spirits is the system taught by the true Adept, as also are the
Ceremonies of Pact with Evil Spirits for their submission. However, the system of Hindu
Teachings, taught in those books, of which I am the Author is based on the following laws
and conception: (1) That the Good Spirits, Angelic Forces and Rulers of the Astral World
are far superior in power to the Evil Forces which are the fallen Spirits of Darkness.
(2) That these latter as a means of their redemption must be reincarnated again. (This
idea is to be found also in True Occultism or as it is frequently and perhaps more cor­
rectly written, Zabino.) (3) As a consequence of this doctrine, all ordinary material
effects and phenomena are produced by the labor of the Lower Spirits under the command
usually of the Good. (4) That consequently whenever the Evil Spirits can escape from
the control of the Good, there is no evil that they will not work by way of vengeance.
(5) That therefore, sooner than obey man, they will try to make him their servant, by
inducing him to conclude Pacts and Agreements with them. (6) That to further this
project they will use every means that offers to obsess and control him. (7) That in
order to become an Adept, therefore, and dominate them, the greatest possible firmness of
will, purity of soul and intent, and power of self-control is necessary. (8) That this is
only to be attained by self-abnegation on every plane. (9) That man therefore is the
middle nature and natural controller between the Good and the Evil Spirits and that,
therefore, to each man is attached naturally both a Guardian Angel and a Malevolent
Spirit, and also certain Spirits that may become Familiar, so that with him it rests to give
the victory unto which he will. (10) That, therefore, in order to control and make service
of the Lower and Evil, the knowledge of the Higher and Good is requisite (i. e., in the
language of the Theosophy of the present day, the knowledge of the Higher Self).
From this it results that the teachings propounded by Paracelsus, Franz Hartman,
Levi, Agrippa and by myself are by purity and self-denial to obtain the knowledge of
and conversation with one’s Guardian Angel, so that thereby and thereafter one may
obtain the power of suppressing the Evil Spirits whenever they desire to do any one an
injury.
This, then, is the system of Hindu,,Spiritism as taught by . the Hindu Adept and Old
Master to the Disciple and elaborated down to the smallest points.
A Good Spirit, if attracted into an assembly of good persons would endeavor to
excite their ideas toward good, while an Evil Spirit attracted among evil-minded persons
would incite them mentally to crime. Among how many criminals is not their only excuse
that “they thought they kept hearing something telling them to commit the crime.”
Yet these suggestions would not always arise from Elementals alone, but frequently from
the depraved Astral remnants of deeeased evil persons, or Earth-bound Spirits.
Evil Spirits, on'the other hand, are far more powerful than Elementals, for their
action for Evil is parallel to that of the Good Spirits for Good; and their malignancy
is far more terrible than that of the Evil Elementals, for not being, like them, subjected
to the limits of certain currents, their sphere of operation extends over a far greater
area; while the Evil they commit is never irrational or mechanical, but worked with full
consciousness and intent. I
The necessity of the invocation of the Divine and Angelic Forces or Good Spirits to
control the Evil Spirits is invariably insisted upon in the operation of Invocations described
and taught in all my published works. . So that it is not so much, as I have said before,
94
^LAURENCE COMPANY, (hicago.iu.c.SA
AND SPIRITUAL
FAITH.
this circumstance, as the mode of its development by our study and preparation, which
is not unusual; while again the thorough and complete classification of the Spirits with
their officers, and of the effects to be produced by their services, is not to be found
elsewhere.
Of all hindrances to Magical action, the very greatest and most fatal is unbelief,
for it checks and stops the action of the Will. Even in the commonest natural opera­
tions we see this. No child could learn to walk, no student could assimilate the
formulas of any science, were doubt and the impracticability and impossibility of so
doing, the first thing in his mind. Therefore it is that all Adepts and Great Teachers
of Religion and of Magic have invariably insisted on the necessity of faith.
The writer could never understand, what many think an imperative necessity, for
them to study and interest themselves in the many different methods and teachings of
Occultism, for every student should select some ‘ good Adept’s Teachings, which he
must first decide for himself to be good, then follow them closely and earnestly, showing
a marked tolerance for other teachings differing from the ones he has selected.
Further, I must say that it has been my experience to find that it is rather the
abuse through ignorance of their meaning, which causes some hasty one to decry the
worthlessness of certain teachings, than their intelligent and properly regulated use,
for if the Disciple be pure in mind, and have developed the clairvoyant faculty which is
latent in every human being, and which is based on the utilization of the thought­
vision, he will succeed. This soul sight, spoken of in the Scriptures as the “Inner or
Spiritual Sight,” is exercised almost unconsciously by every one in thinking of either
a place, person or a thing, which they know well; immediately, coincident with the
thought, the image springs before the mental sight; and it is but the conscious and
voluntary development of this which is the basis of what is commonly called clair­
voyance. Among the Highlanders of Scotland, this faculty, as is well known, is of
common manifestation; and by the English is usually spoken of as “Second Sight.”
■fALISMANS, PENTACLES AND SYMBOLS.
Let it be known by all men that Talismans, Amulets, Charms, Pentacles and Symbols
are valuable as an equilibrated and fitting basis for the reception of Magical force; but
unless the Operator can really attract that force t<? them, they are nothing but so many
dead, and to him worthless, diagrams. But used by the Initiate or Adept who fully com­
prehends their meaning, they become to him a powerful protection and aid, seconding
and focussing the working of his Will, as well as the Power of the Spirits he has invoked.
CONCLUSION.
In conclusion I desire it to be known and understood that there are many who will
fail to understand why the system and methods of Hindu Invocation have been found
to be fitting and suitable in the works on Art Magic and Occultism listed in this Great
Catalogue. Regarding this, let all mankind know that this has been customary in all
ages of man. However, he who does not care to take up the exercises need not do so,
let him study these famous books in their forepart and, he will be more than recompensed
for his time and. trouble.
Further “The Book of Death and Hindu Spiritism,” as well as, The Mystic Test
Book of Hindu Occult Chambers; and, The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic
and East Indian Occultism as well as any and all other books on’this subject listed herein
has been written and published at great labor and an enormous expense solely as a
help to the genuine Occult student and those faithful souls who desire Knowledge and
Wisdom; and that for the opinion of the ordinary literary critic who neither understands
aor believes in Spiritism, Occultism or Art Magic, I care nothing.

De LAURENCE’S NOTICE TO THE DISCIPLE.
That there is a certain kind of Magical Energy, based on the existence of a
spiritual world, placed without, not within you, and into communication with which
you can enter by the use of certain Magical Arts and practices, has long ago by the
High-Grade Adepts of India been demonstrated as a fact.
That these Occult forces can get hold of a person and break him down, as easily
as the fearful hurricane sweeps all before it, attacking his soul in a thousand places at
the same time, without his being able to perceive the invisible foe, or being able to
protect himself, is also proven.
But that these influences, both good and evil, may be dominated, so that they
will obey the thoughts, answer to the voice and understand the meaning of traced
signs, is what many cannot realize, and what their reason rejects; yet, this also is capable
of being demonstrated and proven.
The Student and Disciple should always bear in mind that in trying to demonstrate
these things for himself, he is working with unseen and powerful agents, which, if he
is not equally powerful—pure and high minded, loving his fellow men, and seeking to
benefit mankind, rather than seeking or desiring powers and benefits for himself, he
had much better be dead than to try any of these things for the gratification of his
personal nature; for in seeking to harm another—curses like chickens come home to
roost, with a much greater force than the original impulse.
Thus again you should look within rather than without, as the exercise of True
Art Magic does not require any ceremonies or conjurations, or the making of circles
and signs; it only requires a strong faith, gained through a knowledge of nature’s
laws, which can accomplish anything, if it acts through a human mind which is in har­
mony with these laws, without whichnothing useful can be done. True Magic also
consists in true faith, but true faith rests in spiritual knowledge, and without that
kind of knowledge there can be no faith: this is only obtained by developing one’s
own inner and most lofty nature.
The conjuration of the evil spirits of the astral plane Sorcery and Witchcraft
means practically a full realization of “Faust and the Demon.”
On the pages of “The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic and East Indian
Occultism,” -there are many strange things set forth which many may think are almost
too strange to believe, yet because one is ignorant of their existence, it does not follow
that they are not real, as the sad records of Sorcery and Witchcraft, of Voodooism and
Black Magic abundantly testify.
Man does not know himself, therefore he does not understand the things of the
inner world. Each man has the essence of the Divine within himself; he possesses one
kind of knowledge as much as another, and he who does not find that which is in him,
cannot truly say he does not possess it, only he was not capable of successfully seeking
for it.
Therefore, in seeking, always bear in mind—true growth rests in the capacity of the
human soul and the human will to comprehend spiritual and occult truths and not by
basing its conclusions upon external appearances caused by the illusion of the senses,
or of selfish purposes.
In launching the Great Book Of Magical Art, Hindu Magic An.d East Indian
Occultism once again, before the western student of Spiritism, Occultism and Hindoo
Magic I merely seek to meet the growing demand for authentic instruction of a Magical
character.
Feeling assured that the student will find enough therein to ponder over and
perhaps awaken some responsive chord in his nature, which will lead him to seek for
the Divine within himself rather than trying to awaken external evil forces which
will prove themselves the stronger. All this is plainly set forth in this volume, yet an
additional warning seems to be essential. Any further information concerning the
above will be found by the sincere student in The Great Book Of Magical Art, Hindu
Magic And East Indian Occultism, fully described elsewhere m this catalogue.

Blessed Are Those Who Suffer
By de Laurence
Evil exists; it is impossible to doubt it; those who understand Black or
White Magic can work good or evil.
There are some who, understanding Evil, or Black Magic, work evil know­
ingly and willingly. The spirit of Evil which animates these beings (those who
operate witchcraft and sorcery) and prompts them to do ill, is bewraged, turned
aside from the right road and thrown across the path of good as an obstacle.
Those spirits who perform evil are had in their soul.
“The Great Book Of Magical Art, Hindu Magic And East Indian Occult­
ism/’ of which I am the author, teaches all these things and a great many more; it
is a revelation to students who have been used to studying books written by surface
writers, this being a standard and official work of about 600 pages, bound in Leather
and stamped in Gold.
It teaches the student the true definition of evil. Showing that evil is the
absence of rectitude in being, and that moral evil is falsehood in action; as the lie
is a crime of Speech. It teaches that injustice is of lying spirits, and every lid
from a spirit is an injustice.
When that which spirits utter is just, there is no falsity. When that
which spirits do is equitable and true in mode, there is no sin. Injustice is
the death of moral being, as lying is the poison of intelligence. The false and
lying spirit is therefore a spirit of death. Those who harken to him become his
dupes and are by him poisoned.
The chief attraction of Occultism and Hypnotism, for many curious per­
sons, is that they see therein an exceptional and sure means for the satisfaction
of their passions and wants.
Many men wish to attain these secrets that they be loved by women.
Nothing of the sort; a day will come, stupid man, when it well be too much
to be loved by one of them, for sensual desire is a dual orgie, the intoxication
of which causes disgust to supervent quickly, after which anger and separation
follow.
There was once an old idiot who would have liked to have become a Master
of Occultism in order to upset the world. But if you were an Adept, my friend,
you would not be an imbecile, and before the tribunal of your conscience you
would find no extenuating circumstances if you became a master of this work
in order to use this power for an evil purpose.
The Epicurean, on his part, demands the recipes of Occultism that he may
enjoy forever and suffer nothing at all. In this case the science itself intervenes
and says, as religion also says: “Blessed are those who suffer.” But that is the
reason why the Epicurean has lost faith in religion. “Blessed are those wht
mourn,” but the Epicurean scoffs at the promise. Hear now what is said by
experiences and by reason.
Sufferings test anal awaken generous sentiments; pleasures promote and
fortify base instincts,
(Continued on Next Page.)
98 THE de LAURENCE COMPANY
Sufferings arm against pleasure; enjoyment begets weakness in suffering.
Pleasure squanders; pain ingarners. Pleasure is man’s rock of peril; the pain of
motherhood is woman’s triumph.
Pleasure fertilizes and conceives but pain brings forth.
Woe to him who cannot and will not suffer; he shall be overwhelmed by pain.
Nature drives unmercifully those who will not walk; we are cast into life as into
am open sea; we must swim or drown. Such are the Occult or hidden laws of
Nature. And now reconsider whether one can become a Dioiple of Occultism wt
order to enjoy everything and suffer nothing.
Yet the world will ask: In such case, what profits the Disciple? What
would the prophet Balaam have replied to his she-ass had the patient brute asked
him what profits intelligence? (See Numbers 22nd Chapter. Verses 21, 22, 23,
24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33.) What would Hercules have answered to a
pigmy if he had inquired what profits strength ? I do not compare worldly peo­
ple to pigmies and still less to Balaam’s Ass—it would be wanting in politeness
and good taste. I say, therefore, with all possible graciousness, to such brilliant
and amiable people, that for them Occultism and Spiritism are absolutely use­
less, it being understood further that they will never take it seriously.
Mv Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic and East Indian Occultism
is a Master Work, and is addressed to souls that toil and think. They will find
an explanation therein of whatsoever has remained obscure in Doctrine and
Ritual.
On the pattern of the Great Masters, this work follows the rational order of
Sacred Numbers in plan and division. It is for which reason this Volume is
arranged in two Books, that is, Book One and Book Two all in one Large
Grand Volume.
Be it remembered by all who read here that:—Woe to the child who believes
himself wiser than his parents; to the man who acknowledges no Master; to the
dreamer who thinks and prays by himself.
Life, as shown in “The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic and
East Indian Occultism,” is an universal communion and in such communion
does the true Disciple of Magic and Occultism find immortality.
He who ignores these things isolates himself; is given over to death thereby,
and an eternity of isolation would be eternal death.
Here is a book that is a leader, its a “master work” having had a steady sale
for almost thirty long years.
The true disciple of Magic and Occultism knows from the bottom of his heart,
like the sages of Israel, and the faithful believers of Islam:—There is No God but
God. For the initiates of true Occultism, this signifies:—There is but one Being and
this is Being.
On the other hand, I say to pretended students and curious investigators: why
seek to deny that which you cannot understand ?
Does this dreadful form of personified evil only prompt you to smile?
Hear you not the ceaseless sobbing of surging humanity which writhes and
weeps in the crushing folds of the monster evil ?
(Continued on Next Page} —
THE de LAURENCE COMPANY 99
Have you never heard the atrocious laugh of the evil spirit who is persecuting
the just man?
Have you never experienced in yourself the opening of those infernal deeps
which the genius of perversity furrows in every soul ? Moral evil exists—such is
the unhappy truth; it reigns in certain spirits; it incarnates in certain men; but
the most wicked of these are earth bound spirits of evil. More than this, I do not
ask you to admit, and it will be difficult for you to grant me less.
Art Magic and Occultism was the exclusive heritage of Israel and invio­
lable secret of its priests.
The secret doctrines taught in “The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu
Magic and East Indian Occultism” are the Mysteries of Eleuis and of Thebes.
The Gentiles preserved some of its symbols but in a debased form, and the Mystic
Key was lost amidst the apparatus of an ever-increasing superstition.
Jerusalem, murderer of its prophets and prostituted over and over again
to the false Assyrian and Babylonian gods, ended by losing in turn the Sacred
Word, when a Saviour, declared to the Magi by the holy Star of Initiation,
came to rend the threadbare veil of the old Temple, to endow the souls of
earnest disciples with a new network of legends and Occult Symbols—ever con­
cealing from the profane, and always preserving for the disciple that truth
which is the same forever.
Let the beginner know that:—“Nothing which is Hidden is lost, but at the
same time nothing that is found, is absolutely new. Again, that the seal of
eternity is affixed in the souls of all men.
That profanation has befallen the doctrine of Occultism, Spirtism and Magic
I have no intention to deny; repeated, and handed down from age to age, the
misuse itself has been a great and terrible lesson for those who made secret
things unwisely known.
The grand truth of Occultism and Magic demand only to be found, when
the simplest will be able to comprehend it and to prove it also at need.
At the same time the' truth of real Occultism will never become vulgar.
Those that doubt this must understand that “The Great Book of Magical Art,
Hindu Magic And East Indian Occultism,” although almost thirty years have
passed since the publication of its first edition, has never been offered only to
the sincere student.
Again, it is the only book of its kind in all tfhe world, and as its sale has
been limited the Secret Instruction contained therein will never become common.
The average so-called student always goes for a cheap new book put on
sale by some “money-grafting” advertising mountebank.
Those who insist upon buying books of this kind are doomed to disap­
pointment.
It is vain to hope to advance or invoke help ichen your cart is stuck in the
mud of ignorance and false teaching; unless you take pick and shovel, like the
Waggoner in the fable, Divine Wisdom will not draw you out of the rut.
Help yourself, and God (the power within your own soul) will help you.

could tell you in their multitude of guesses.
I have been referred to by many as “The Moses of the Hindus” because I
plainly give all the Doctrines of the Magi, so that the student can become the
possessor of those secrets which will give him complete mastery over the occult
powers of Nature.
My book shows that by conformity with the rules of the Eternal Occult
Power that man may unite himself to the creative energy and become creator
and preserver in his turn. Nature has not limited narrowly the number of
rounds on the Occult Ladder of Astral Light.
Here is a master work that teaches that:—Whatsoever Nature has consti­
tuted inferior to man is thereby to him made subject:—It is for the disciple of
Occultism to extend his domain and occult powers in virtue of continual ascent,
length and even perpetuity of life, the field of air and its storms, the earth and
its metallic veins, light and its wondrous illusions, darkness and the dreams
thereof, disease, death, and the spirits of the astral plans.
All these do therefore obey the occult powers of the Adept, the Disciple’s
word, and the Magic Wand of the Master of Spirit Art.
The Adept in Magical Art and Alchemy becomes king of the elements,
transmuter of metals, interpreter of visions, controller of oracles, master of
life in fine, according to the mathematical order of Nature and conformably
to the will of the Supreme Intelligence (God). The student who will study
loyally and thereby attain knowledge will never regret the trouble nor the
investment he has made in this wonderful Volume.
I have made no attempt to conceal Truth or Occult Secrets under the veil
of Parables or Hieroglyphical Signs as do some writers on these subjects.
The time has come when everything should be told and made plain to the
student, and this book tells everything. It is my intention in publishing this
Revised Edition to unveil that ever-hidden secret science which, as I have indi­
cated, has always been hidden behind the shadows of ancient mysteries.
Transcental Magic means that Divine art or exercise of Spiritual and Occult Powers
by which the awakened Magical Forces in man control the invisible living elements in
the soul substance of the universe; but above all, those in his own soul, which are the
ones nearest to him. —■ ' 'r'
If you desire to master any forces whatever, it is, above all, necessary to know what
they are and how they originate, and as we have no better means to study the qualities of
any internal forces than by observing those which are active within ourselves, the per-
I ception of the processes going on within our own psychic organism will be the means to
accomplish your object.
Therefore, let it be known that Transcendental Magic is the exercise of Spiritual
Power to be obtained only by a knowledge of these forces, and this power cannot be
acquired in any other way; nor is it possible to teach anyone how to exercise a power
which he does not possess, because he has not developed it. The Master and teacher can
only indicate the way in which the Occult and Magical powers, latent in every human
constitution, may be developed.
The constitutions of all men are fundamentally the same, and in each human being
are contained Occult powers germinally or in a latent condition; but they cannot be said
to exist before they become active and manifest themselves, first, interiorly, and after­
wards in au outward direction.
It was not my object in composing “The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic
And East Indian Occultism’' to write merely a code of ethics, and thereby increase the
already existing pile of moral precepts, but to assist the disciple In the study of Occultism,
This Volume was also published to give an impulse to the study of a aolonee which
may be called the ‘‘anatomy and- physiology of the soul," which Investigates the glementg
of which the organism of the soul is composed, and the source frqu< which man's Occult
and Magical and Spiritual powers as well as his desirgs and emotions spring.—de Laurence,

The Ancient Magi
Jacob’s Ladder Of Astral Light
BY L. W. de LAURENCE
Magic is the science of the Ancient Magi;and all sincere studentsof the Occult revere
those Mystic Kings who came from the East, led by a star, to adore Jesus the Master in
his cradle. The Ancient Magi are elevated by tradition to the rank of Kings, because
magical initiation constitutes a true royalty:because also the great art of the Magi is
characterized by all Adepts as “Art Magic.” The star which conducted the pilgrims is
the same Burning Star which is met with in all Initiations into Eastern Orders.
The Three Headed Snake Ring was the Talisman Ring of the Ancient Magi, and
was held by them to be the mystic personification of strength, being commonly known as
“THE RING OF STRENGTH.” The Ancient Magi taught that it is only by conformity
with the rules of eternal power that man may unite himself to the creative energy and
become creator and preserver in turn. God (Nature), has not limited narrowly the number
of rounds on Jacob’s ladder of Astral Light. Whatsoever Nature has constituted inferior
to man is thereby to him made subject: it is for man to extend his domain in Virtue of
continual ascent. Length and even perpetuity of life, the field of air and its storms, the
earth and its metallic veins, light and its wondrous illusions, darkness and the dreams
thereof, death and its spirits—all these do therefore obey the Royal Sceptre of the Magi,
the shepherd’s staff of Jacob, and the terrible Magic Wand of Moses. The Adept becomes
King of the elements, transmuter of metals, interpreter of visions, controller of oracles,
master of life, in fine, according to the mathematical order of Nature and conformably
to the will of the Supreme Intelligence. Thus is Magic and Occultism in all their glory
taught in my work, namely, “THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC
AND EAST INDIAN OCCULTISM,” which is now almost one-fifth of a century in
print. But you may ask, is there any one in these days who will dare to give credence to
such words as those written here? The answer is—those who will study loyally and attain
knowledge frankly. I make no attempt to conceal truth under Veil of parables or hiero­
glyphical signs; the time has come when everything should be told to the sincere student of
the Occult, and I have told everything, as you will find if you ever study “THE GREAT
BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC AND EAST INDIAN OCCULTISM.”
It is my life work, my intention, in short, to unveil that ever secret science which, as I
have shown in the above mentioned book, is hidden behind the shadows of Ancient Mys­
teries. I come to drag from the darkness of ignorance the blackened skeleton of material­
ism and to sap the fundamental dogmas of ill-instructed Christians of their ethics. Some
will question the utility of combating materialism in which, as they imagine, every one
believes. It is, therefore, important to enunciate my object clearly and establish my
principles solidly.
I, de Laurence, author of “THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU
MAGIC AND EAST INDIAN OCCULTISM'/’ do therefore say, to all who read here,
whether they be Christians or otherwise, that I have a soul like yourselves. My faith,
however, is that of a soul which is strongly and deeply convinced that God and Nature
are One, and that God is within, and not without the soul of man.
If such be the case, you may ask, how comes it that so exalted a science as Occult
science is still unrecognized? How is it possible to assume that so bright a sun is hidden
in a sky so dark? This Transcendental Science has been known always, but only to wise
men of great intelligence, who have understood the necessity of silence and patience.
Should a skillful surgeon open at midnight the eyes of a man born blind, it would still be
impossible to make him realize the nature or existence of daylight till morning came.
Occult Science has its nights and its mornings, because the life which it communicates to
the world of mind is characterized by the regular modes of motion and progressive phases.
It is the same with truths as it is with radiations of light. Nothing which is hidden is
lost, but at the same time nothing that is found is absolutely new. The seal of eternity is
affixed by Nature to that Truth which is the reflection of its glory.
The Transcendental Ccience, the absolute science, is assuredly Magic, though the
affirmation may seem utterly paradoxical to those who never questioned the infallibility of
Voltaire—that marvelpug gmatterer who thought he knew $9 much because he never

missed an opportunity for laughter instead of learning. Magic was the science of
Abraham and Orpheus, of Confucius and Zoroaster, and it was Magical Doctrines which
were graven on Tables of Stone by Enoch and by Trismegistus. Moses purified and re­
veiled them—this being the sense of the word reveal. The new disguise which he gave
them was that of the Holy Kabalah—that exclusive heritage of Israel and inviolable
secret of its priests.
The mysteries of Eleusis and of Thebes preserved among the Gentiles some of its
symbols, but in a debased form, and the “MYSTIC KEY” was lost amidst the apparatus
of an ever-increasing superstition. Jerusalem, murderer of its prophets and prostituted
over and over again to false Assyrian and Babylonian gods, ended by losing in its turn
the Sacred Word, when a Saviour, declared to the Magi by the Holy Star of Initiation,
come to rend the threadbare Veil of the old Temple, to endow the Church with a new
network of legends and symbols—ever concealing from the profane and always preserv­
ing for the wise intellect that truth which is the same for ever. That profanation has
befallen Occultism and Magic I have no intention to deny; repeated from age to age and
handed down from generation to generation, its grand truths have become befogged by
materialism and superstition. However, those who wish the truth will find it fully enun­
ciated in “THE GREAT. BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU AND EAST INDIAN
OCCULTISM.” Let it be known, and it is written here, as a sign to all men, that this
Great Work was only published for the sincere investigator and true student. No book
of its kind has ever been published since the beginning of the world, and it is no untruth
to state that no other book equal to it will ever be written and handed to mankind. In
consequence of this, I frankly and honestly state that it never was the intention of the
Great Masters that this book be owned or even sought after only by the real student and
honest, truth-seeking soul.
On another page you will find a description of the famous TALISMAN RING OF
INDIA. The very same being a THREE HEADED SNAKE RING, constructed exclu­
sively of Virgin Gold And Precious Stones. This Talisman Ring was never made for the
novice, nor for the one who does not care to follow the footsteps of the old Adepts, and
learn the great hidden secret of the Magi. Those who, with unbounded faith, wear this
handsome Ring as a Talisman of the Magi and a true Symbol of their sincerity will be
fully rewarded. The price placed on this ring is, without doubt, the lowest at which it
could be sold.
The Power To Cast Out Evil Spirits
By L. W. de Laurence
Sorcery is intimately connected with Witchcraft. The difference between them is, that in
Witchcraft all those .who. practice it sell themselves to vicious Evil Spirits, and make a “Pact”
with them by entering into an agreement with them in consequence of some advantages
which the spirits undertake to secure to the one who practices Witchcraft and Black Magic.
The Sorcerer obtains power over Evil Spirits in general, so that he can command them to
appear at his pleasure, and execute his orders. He acquires this influence by his skill in
Charms and Invocations, and by his acquaintance with the deeper phases of Occultism and
with the laws of the material and spiritual worlds.
Jesus gave his Disciples the power to cast out Evil Spirits, as well as to heal all manner
of diseases, which must of course have included epilepsy and insanity. He appealed to the
ejection of demons as one great, proof of his Messiahship; nay, as the grand proof that the
kingdom of heaven was come nigh to the Jews. He viewed the casting out of Evil Spirits
as one of the greatest of. his works, and allowed to his Disciples, that next to their names
being written in heaven, it was a cause for joy that the “spirits were subject to them.” In
short, whether we consider the actions and language of those Spirits themselves, or of those
who were under their influence, or of even the Master Jesus and his apostles, we are led
to the conclusion that they were real cases of obsession; and that invisible malignant spirits
had brought the demoniacs under their influence, and exerted over them a mysterious, but
real and fatal control.
The principal means by which Evil Spirits exert their power, and carry on their inter­
course with this world, are to be found in the many forms of Witchcraft, Sorcery, Divina­
tion, Necromancy, and Enchantment, as well as false Oracles, Obsessions, and temptations of
various kinds. In some of these, such as Witchcraft, Black Art and Sorcery, evil earth bound
spirits, or invisible beings, for instance, the souls of criminals and suicides who once in­
habited this earth are concerned, and the efficacy of some of the forms of Sorcery and Black
Magic are the direct result of inevitable fate, or pre-established connection of laws, put in
requisition by the Evil Charms and Spells of those who practice Witchcraft,

A VOLUME OF UNQUESTIONABLE AUTHORITY
The combining of "THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU
MAGIC AND EAST INDIAN OCCULTISM” with "THE FAMOUS BOOK OF
SECRET HINDU, CEREMONIAL AND TALISMANIC MAGIC,” is one of the
greatest achievements of the present age.
These two famous Books, having been published and bound INTO ONE
MASSIVE VOLUME, make a Veritable Literary Microcosm; the Occult and
Esoteric teachings of the world put into one handsome Volume.
Over 25 years ago "THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU
MAGIC AND EAST INDIAN OCCULTISM” was first published, and since
that time it has been accepted by the whole world of Occult Scholarship as an
official work; an exhaustive Compendium of Spiritualism; Encyclopaedia of
Talismanic Magic, and the deeper branches of Eastern Occultism.
Here is a book that Changes the Lives of Men and Women. A work that
contains "ALL SECRET THINGS.” It was originally published over 25 years
ago. The present Edition has been revised and enlarged: TWO HUNDRED
PAGES HAVING BEEN ADDED. It has been purchased by the greatest living
Occult students, and this is proof of the value of this Volume to a class of
students whose watch word under any and all circumstances must be efficiency
in Occult Studies.
It has been distributed among no less than Twenty-Seven countries, and
found its way to the Arctic Circle and South America. Students of this work
cover the entire world, including Egypt, India, Africa, Japan, and China.
The appearance of the TWELFTH, REVISED EDITION, has marked an era in the world’s
Spiritual and Esoteric development. It presents, in orderly and convenient form, the oldest as well
as the latest systems; therefore, its success was immediate and widespread.
It is not surprising that a Volume giving a New Inventory of Extant Knowledge of Occultism
and Magic, should be in the homes of families in this country and Europe, and) among the leaders
of Finance, Industry and Commerce in all parts of the world.
Again, the list of purchasers also contains the names of Clerks*, Farmers, Laborers, and hun­
dreds of others in every walk of life all over the world.
"THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC AND EAST INDIAN OCCULT­
ISM” after a Steady Sale for over a quarter of a century, has achieved its object of effecting a
broad distribution.
SPECIAL NOTICE.—As soon as you learn these Secret Instructions contained in this Great
Book and have developed Clairvoyancy—many may desire you to teach these Hindu secrets to them.
In case you instruct or develop anyone de Laurence does here caution and admonish you in this
Beginning to Be Secret, and neither teach nor manifest to anyone thy work, or Place, or time, nor
thy desire, or will, except it be to a Master or Partner or Companion, who should likewise be Faith­
ful, Discreet, Silent, and dignified by Nature and Education. Neither shouldst thou you Expose
or Reveal them to unworthy or unscrupulous persons; but reveal them only to Faithful, Discreet,
and Chosen Friends, as thy associating with a prating companion, whose misbelief, doubting, ques­
tioning, and, lastly, unworthiness, hinders and disturbs the effect and result of every Magical
Operation, for the Master Lamas and powerful Spirits of the Astral Plane desire that ye sock not
the companionship of him who is unworthy of thy trust.

The Greatest Tribute Ever Given An Author
Read on another page, the remarkable Sworn Testimonial from Dr. A.
George Baker. It is the greatest tribute ever given an author.
DR. A. GEORGE BAKER, it will be noted, is a regular practitioner of
medicine in the City of Philadelphia, Pa.; Member of the State and County
Medical Society, and president of the Cooper Literary Institute. This Physician’s
testimonial was sworn to and subscribed before a Notary Public.
Again, when such men as MR. W. T. KIRK, RESIDENT MANAGER OF
THE LONDON GUARANTEE AND ACCIDENT COMPANY, and DR. HER­
BERT L. WHITNEY, SECRETARY OF THE NEW YORK STATE ASSOCIA­
TION OF SPIRITUALISTS, swearl to a Testimonial testifying to the merit of a
book, it means that it is a most valuable Volume.
Remember that these people, who testify that "THIS GREAT BOOK” is
more than claimed, paid TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS for it.
It must be a marvelous book that causes people to send their
Sworn Testimonial from different parts of the world, like the
scholar from India, whose mind, not dwelling in the present, is
forever thinking of the life to come. The brainy Medical Man,
the Farmer, the Railroad President, and the Mechanic.
In fact, this book knows no distinction of creed or caste,
and its students are limited, indeed, by but one condition—the
desire to learn, and the ability to read the English language.
To show the diversity of homes into which this handsome
Volume finds its way, one need only to point to the single contrast
between the Hindu Disciple of Occultism in the Temples of old
India, and the Disciple of Occultism in America.
Each are devoted to the same Master, and in the soul of each
gladly burns the flame of true faith and belief in de Laurence
and his books.
de Laurence has students all over the world. No other liv­
ing man is looked upon as a single authority in as many coun­
tries of the world as is this great author. The need for his teach­
ings is universal because the need for knowledge is universal.
No other Occult work is so comprehensive that it could
successfully claim to answer the requirements of the Hindu, the
European and the American Occult student.
"THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU
MAGIC AND EAST INDIAN OCCULTISM” is plainly written.
Every item of information is revealed at a glance. One knows
just where to look for what he wishes to learn.
Do no waste your book money by spending it for books by
unknown authors; concentrate it, and get this famous Volume
before the price is again raised to $3 5.00.

This book brings the student in contact with Hidden Occult Secrets. Occultism
is the One Science Coeval with creation itself, it is the KEY TO ALL MIRACLES.
As regard the philosophical side of Occultism, its great doctrine is Equilibrium,
Equilibrium between Church and State; its great hypothesis is analogy; while in the
moral sense Equilibrium is the concurrence of science and faith.
The KEY to the ancient Occult Sciences have been| practically lost only to those
great Masters such as Levi, Paracelsus, and de Laurence.
The Grand Truths of Occultism demand only to be found, when the simplest will
be able to comprehend them.
THERE IS NO GOD BUT GOD
de Laurence is the greatest authority today on the subjects of Occultism and
Spiritualism, and, as he says with touching pathos: THERE IS NO GOD BUT GOD.
THERE IS BUT ONE BEING AND THIS IS BEING.
“THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC AND EAST INDIAN
OCCULTISM,” is the most elaborate Compendium of the Esoteric and Occult Systems
of old India and the Far East. Although Twenty Five Years have elapsed since this
Volume was first published in the United States, the great minds of the world are
still occupied with its serious teachings.
de Laurence is, in the fullest sense of the word, the world’s interpreter of
Spiritual forces. This great man of the so-called Christian era, has mirrored faith­
fully in his works the Spiritualism and Magic of the Hindu Philosophers who lived
thousands of years before himself.
Paracelsus, Levi, Flamel, Van Helmut, Maier, and many others, now in Spirit
Life, have transmitted the indelible imprint of their teachings upon de Laurence and
his Great Occult School. Thus is warranted the inference that to de Laurence was
revealed Divine Wisdom. A. s de Laurence’s School and Teachings have survived the
shock of time, what can this Wisdom be but Divine and Eternal?
’ MEN, IN PROPORTION TO THEIR INTELLECT, HAVE ADMITTED HIS
TRANSCENDENT CLAIM.

"Never in my life did I invest in anything which made me so successful as the purchase of

de Laurence, Dear Master: St. Louis, Mo., Aug. 18th, 1916.
"THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC AND EAST INDIAN OCCULT­

to tell you of my experience on Monday evening when I held this handsome book close to my breast
while sending an earnest prayer to my Creator and you, my Master.
"I was then sitting in my room, and saw THREE HIGH SPIRITS ALL IN WHITE. They
covered me all over with a beautiful BLUE LIGHT which gradually changed into a violet color.
I felt like something was raising me up and then I felt a great warmth and SPIRITUAL GOD LIKE
POWER WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM OUT OF THIS WONDERFUL BOOK. I HAVE
NOW FELT ITS POWER AND SHALL NEVER PART WITH IT AS LONG AS I LIVE.
"Again, thanking you, Master de Laurence, for this wonderful Volume and the inspiration
it has already given me, I will close hoping that the Peace of God may be with you forevermore.”
From Your Sincere Student.

And East Indian Occultism.” I have carefully read the same
and find it to be all that de Laurence claims for it. I have
read several other works treating on the same subjects, but find
this work far superior to them all. No student of Occultism ought
to attempt to pass through the portals of the Temple of Occult
truths until he has mastered this wonderful book. The instruc­
tions therein given are so plain that any ordinary mind can soon
master the science.
The sincere student who becomes a student of de
Laurence can easily develop a degree of Occult Power, Clairvoy-
ancy and Mediumship that will be a surprise and revelation to
him, as it fully explains and teaches the Esoteric Philosophy of
India, and removes all obstacles from the path of him who would
seek to attain Occult Power, the Clairvoyant or Introspection
State.

This is to testify that I have purchased “The Great Book Of

L. W. de Laurence, of Chicago, Ill. I will say that the work is
more than it is represented to be and worth fifty times the price
asked for it, and I would advise any person who can do so to order
a copy of this Massive Work on Occultism and Hindu Magic, and
become a student of de Laurence’s, as the knowledge con­
tained in it is a revelation. I would not take $1,000 for the
knowledge obtained from it of the methods used by the Hindoos
to develop Clairvoyancy, Mediumship, Hypnotic and Occult
Powers.
The work also teaches the Invocation of the Spirits of the
Astral Plane, White and Black Magic, as well as the Secrets of
the Inner Circle of Hindu Adepts.
The Occult Secrets revealed in this large volume by de
Laurence are those which are known only to the ancient Sages
and to the Hindu Adepts and Rosicrucians of the Middle Ages,
and are invaluable.

I, Prof. G. B. Stewart, first being duly sworn, deposes and says:
This is to certify that I am the happy possessor of a complete
treatise on Hindu Magic and Indian Occultism, by L. W.
de Laurence, a High Caste Yoghi and Adept, for which I paid
$12.00, and after a careful examination and study of said work I
not only find it to be all that de Laurence claims it to be, but
I find it to be far superior to any other course on the market.
I have seven other courses, including a course from the New York
Institute, Rochester, N. Y., and American College of Sciences,
Philadelphia, Pa., and they dwindle into insignificance when com­
pared to this handsome volume now offered to the world by
L. W. de Laurence on Clairvoyancy, Mediumship, Occultism,
Hindu Magic and Hypnotism, which fully explains the secret
Hindu methods.
Any person who studies this work will readily see that
de Laurence is one of those High Grade Adepts who has become
as perfect in the lines of Occult Wisdom as any of the great Hindu
Adepts. His power to teach this secret knowledge is perfectly
marvelous, and the student can understand them with an ease
and readiness that is a constant source of admiration and wonder
to him.
Owing to the clearness and precision of the instructions in
this volume, a little practice every day will enable the student to
develop a deep degree of Occult Power, and the correctness of
the information will be an everlasting surprise to the Neophyte,
as de Laurence is a true Adept, who has attained the highest
pinnacles of Esoteric Wisdom, and those who follow this great
Adept’s teachings will scorn to make use of or follow any one of
the endless variety of external and childish methods taught by
the so-called Institutes and Occulists.

statement to assure any one whom it may concern that de
Laurence’s wonderful book on Hindu Magic and Indian Occult­
ism surpasses any course that I have ever been able to obtain.
As it has been my life’s ambition to become a Clairvoyant
and Healer, I have spent a vast amount on works pertaining to
the science of Occultism and not until I had received and studied
"‘The Great Book Of Magical Art, Hindu Magic And East Indian
Occultism’ ’ did I consider myself in possession of the true key of
the marvelous Occult Powers and Secrets of the Hindu Adepts.
And no person can help taking a deep interest in these Occult
Treatises, especially in the instructions for developing for the
trance state.
Tin's great Eastern Adept illustrates and teaches his stu­
dents the secret knowledge of those who belong to the Silent
Austere Brotherhood, and his Volume is a complete course of in­
structions which contains the methods used by the Eastern
Magis, and the essentials of their teachings.

I, Mrs. M. B. Woodward, first being duly sworn, deposes and says:
After closely studying de Laurence’s latest work, “The
Great Book Of Magical Art, Hindu Magic And East Indian Oc­
cultism,’’ I feel it my duty, both to de Laurence and the many
who desire true knowledge of the Occult, to state that of the many
writers on these subjects, such as Agrippa, Magnus, and a num­
ber of others, none of their writings are to be compared with the
latest work from his pen. It is a large work, embracing the most
advanced Occult teachings, and the simplest rules for the develop­
ment of Spiritual and Occult power.
The development of Clairvoyance and Mediumship as it is
taught and practiced in India is a revelation to those who have
tried to discover the true Occult power, and they will thank the
author for furnishing them with such a grand text book on Hindu
Magic and Occultism. This volume, besides being handsomely
bound in Black Seal Leather, is replete with knowledge of the
Occult, taking up in the many chapters its different aspects, such
as Spiritism, Adeptship, Witchcraft, Ceremonial Magic, Astral
Entities, Necromancy, Obsession, Exorcism, Invocations and Con­
juration of Spirits of the Astral Plane, Etc., Etc.
The Glossary, giving to the student definitions of all OCCULT
TERMS used, which is appended, shows the author to be a master
of the subject, and any person who desires to develop Occult
Power, Clairvoyancy or Mediumship, and obtain accurate and
secret knowledge of the inner circle of the Adepts of India, should
procure a copy of this work, as it is plainly shown that de
Laurence is the only person who has even been granted the right
to put these secrets into English, and the student is given knowl­
edge obtained by one who has spent years among the Adepts of
India, who are the greatest wonder workers in Occultism the
world has ever known.

That after having purchased and studied “The Great Book

de Laurence, I will here state that it is the most wonderful
work on the Occult that has ever been put in print, and should be
in the hands of all who are interested in Occult Science, as the
instructions for the development of Clairvoyancy, Mediumship,
Occult and Psychic Powers are so specific and plain that they
cannot but be understood, and any person who has an opportunity
to purchase this famous work should do so by all means, as a study
of its contents will readily convince you that ' de Laurence is
not an imposter but an Adept, who has knowledge of Occult and
Unseen Forces of Nature, that are not known outside of the
Orient.
Having taken many courses and studied books of all descrip­
tions which profess to teach the Occult, and found them worth­
less, I feel that I am competent to judge.
Those who compare this famous work with others that pro­
fess to reveal these secrets, will readily realize the truthfulness
of this statement, as the chapters on Witchcraft, Magic and Sor­
cery, Mediumship and Clairvoyancy are worth thousands of dol-
ars to the student and investigator of “The Occult.”

Mind, Soul and Body such as has never been taught in the western

Secrets and knowledge that were, revealed only to the initiated
in the Inner Temple where the ancient mysteries were taught

I, L. J. Everett, first being duly sworn, deposes and says:
Any advanced student, or any one who is at all conversant

Hindu Magic And East Indian Occultism” for the development
of Spiritual and Occult Powers.
Neither could an advanced Adept, such as de Laurence
certainly is, remain ignorant of the value this knowledge would
be if revealed to the western investigator of Occultism; there­
fore, when he was granted the right to place this secret knowl­
edge in the hands of those who are sincere in their intentions to
learn how to develop their Occult Powers, he, at great expense
and labor, published this work, and those who are fortunate
enough to get this volume of secret knowledge which this Adept,
who is the Initiated and Wonder-Working Medium between the
Great Concealed Adepts of India and the western world, is the
author, will realize that rarely, if ever, they will again be given
the opportunity of obtaining this true system of Magical instruc­

Omaha, Neb., March 17th, 1903.
I, N. J. Maxwell, being first duly sworn, deposes and says:
The Occult instructions in “The Great Book of Magical Art,
Hindu Magic And East Indian Occultism’’ are found to be car­
ried out even to minute detail, so that the Author’s system of
Magical Art is thoroughly reliable, because correct in all its attri­
butions, and this being so, there is no possible chance for the
student to fail to understand his Mystic Teachings or their inner
Occult Meaning, and attain possession of the system of Sacred
and Secret Magic of the Hindus.
The Author of this work has also dispelled the belief that this
secret knowledge was only really obtainable by those who were
willing to quit their home and their country and undergo dangers
and hardships in its quest.
It is entirely beyond the scope of this testimony for me to
give here any lengthy dissertation on the merits and worth of
de Laurence’s volume on Indian Occultism. I will, therefore,
only state briefly and concisely that the principal differences
between this wonderful book and other courses which claim to
teach the true system of Secret Magic, is that de Laurence’s
“Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic and Occultism” is an official,
authentic and standard work, founded on the Secret knowledge
of the Hindu Adepts, while the best that can be said of the others
is that they are badly misrepresented, inferior and insignificant
when compared to this volume of Occult instructions.
Having! spent One Hundred and Thirty-Three Dollars and
Fifty Cents for the following inferior courses, I cannot help hav­
ing great appreciation for this master work: Weltman’s (Per­

Being an earnest investigator of all Occult, Spirit and Hyp­

who, like myself, have long desired an official and authentic work
on Occultism, Hindu Magic, Astral Influence, Clairvoyancy,
Witchcraft, Demonology and Sorcery, that de Laurence’s
“Great Book Of Magical Art, Hindu Magic And East Indian
Occultism” is the most intensely interesting and instructive work
that has ever been published on these subjects which the incom­
petent have made such failures of.
Visionary and impractical aspects of the subject, as well as
all unnecessary incumbrances are eliminated, and at last a scien­
tific basis of instruction is found. The author’s style, like his
thought, is clear, penetrative, brilliant and impressive, which
gives the student and reader a high regard for him and his Occult
teachings.
de Laurence certainly ranks with the foremost writers
and Adepts of the Orient, and this volume of almost six hundred
pages is one of rare value, and well worth the price asked for it.
From de Laurence’s handsome volume the student can
learn the Key and every Phase of the Hindu Mystics, Occult
Secrets for the development of Clairvoyancy, Mediumship and

$5.00 Genuine Leather Talisman Case is given away FREE to
everyone who sends an order for "THE GREAT BOOK OF MAG­
ICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC AND EAST INDIAN OCCULT­

None of THE SEVEN FAMOUS SACRED MAGICAL ART
TALISMANS will be sent to anybody for money; because a Talis­
man sold for money is Crossed and of no use. Again, we shall
insist these Talismans be kept out of the hands of the curious
individual, who would be only too willing to spend big money
in buying them in order to carry out his own selfish wishes. These
Sacred Talismans are only to be placed in the hands of the sincere
student of Occult Sciences.
All Mysteries, as taught by de Laurence, in his GREAT
BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC AND EAST IN­
DIAN OCCULTISM, are the Mysteries which were handed down
from the middle ages; the arts which give you the Secret of
domination over Men, Spirits, Disease, and Animals, as well as
the Occult forces of nature.
The popular traditions of Magic affirm that he who possesses
the KEY TO OCCULTISM can communicate with Spirits of all
grades. These Keys, so often lost, and as often recovered, are no
more than the SEVEN MAGICAL ART TALISMANS. By the aid
of these Talismans, and by their Infinite Combinations, which ard
like those of Numbers and Letters, it is possible, for those who
study THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC
AND EAST INDIAN OCCULTISM to arrive at the natural and
mathematical revelation of all Secrets of Nature, and it is in this
sense that communication is established with the whole heirarchy
of intelligence. Each of these SEVEN SACRED MAGICAL ART
TALISMANS bears the SIGN EMBLEMATICAL of their number
as a popular Pentacle.
The Hindu Adepts, in their wisdom, were on their guard against placing
these things in the hands of the common, as the advanced Occult student is
always brought into touch with one of the most valuable Secrets in the whole
domain of Occultism. The truth is that the Evocation of Elementary Spirits im­
plies power to coagulate fluids by a projection of the Astral Light, and this power,
so directed, can produce wonderful things as is shown by de Laurence, in his
GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC, AND EAST INDIAN
OCCULTISM. (Continued on Next Page)

Charm and Talisman which will change ENEMIES TO FRIENDS, and will disperse

“Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church;
and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.”—Matthew 16:18.
The words, which compose this famous text, will be found written within the great dome of St. Peter’s
church in Rome. Peter was a "rock” and upon this rock Christ founded his church; and "the gates of Hell did
not prevail against it.” The Seven Sacred Magical Art Talismans, are, to those who believe in their singular
efficacy, wonderful Amulets that are invincible, and evil influences and secret enemies shall not prevail against them
any more than did the gates of Hell prevail against the rock upon which Christ built his church.

THE SACRED ELEPHANT

The Sacred Elephant Of India. It is written in Ancient Manuscripts that The Spirit of
ORIENS, KING OF THE EAST, is one of the Four Potent Rulers of the Spiritual World,
that he rideth upon a SACRED ELEPHANT. His power over Evil Spirits, according to the
Ancients, is great, and he can answer truly to all demands for help from those Obsessed
or Tormented by Evil Spirits.

ible appearance in less space of time than any known instrument.

Sacred Magical Art Talisman No. 18308
TA1LSMAN FOR DISEASE AND ILL HEALTH
This Talisman, so states a certain GUIDE TO ANCIENT MYSTERIES, has proved to be
very good; so much so, that when it is worn, no disease can advance. Believed to be effi­
cacious where the state is one of a morbid gloomy nature. Let the party who is afflicted
of a'disease which he would have cured, keqp with him this Talisman both during the Day
and the Night. Directly after obtaining this HEALING TALISMAN write your name on the
back thereof in Red Ink, and below your name write the following words, also in Red Ink.
So steadfast and strong is my faith and belief in the extraordinary power, of this
Sacred Talisman, against disease, which I now keep about my person, may it therefore be
the means of Healing my lamentable sickness.
Remember, O! man, that the wearer of this; SACRED TALISMAN must have a steadfast,
firm and Confident Faith in the Divine power of God, and also in the Healing Powers of his
own Soul if he would overcome disease. By making use of this Talisman the most miracu­
lous cures are said to have been performed. As there is nothing therein which is in any
way derogatory to the Power of the Supreme Being, there certainly can be no harm in
trying it.
If it be required to perform a cure upon one at a distance, without the afflicted party’s
knowledge, obtain this SACRED HEALING TALISMAN, and then write the following words,
also in Red Ink. By my steadfast faith and belief in the singular efficacy and extraordinary
power of this Sacred Talisman I Destroy and Rebuke this Disease now troubling the one
whose name I have written abovev Many claim to have Healed Divers Diseases this way;
the disease wearing, by little and little, away. Therefore keep it Secret from the one whom
you desire to relieve of their lamentable sickness.—Ancient MS.
Sacred Magical Art Talisman No. 183 09
TALISMAN FOR ENEMIES
"He that carrieth this Talisman in a Leather Talisman Case shall be protected from enemies.”—Ancient MS.
"Rebuke the company of Spearmen; scatter thou the people that delight in war.”—Psalm LXVIII, 30.
This Talisman, is said to be very powerful, for those who may . be in trouble of any
kind. It is reproduced on Virgin Parchment in Gold Ink.
The power attributed to this Talisman is one that makes it dangerous for any person
to attempt to injure the one who carries it. In view of this, should they attempt; it, this
Talisman will render their efforts and dangerous work abortive, so it is believed. They
will be forced against their will to quit you, and you need fear no harm, if this TALISMAN
is carried in a Genuine Leather Talisman Case. Those who have this Talisman trust, and
fear not; Amapmon, is, they believe, their strength and power over enemies—Ancient MS.
This Talisman is a rare piece oft workmanship of the Ancient Magi; which in the lan­
guage of the Adepts signifies: “A Great Protector.” Such, be it known to all who read
here with an interested eye, is Sacred Talisman Number 18309. Great money has been
offered for this Talisman but it will never be sold for money and can positively only be

IT
Harry Gilmore, a young real estate dealer, had just finished supper with his wife,
pushed his chair back from the table preparatory to lighting his pipe, and pondering
over his ill luck and failure to make money. The weather outside was stinging cold,
the storm raged and swirled the sleet and snow with its frenzied whirlwinds. Although
the intense cold driven by the strong wind penetrated every opening, Gilmore and his
wife were comfortable—that is to say, comfortable physically.
The time had come in Harry Gilmore’s life when mental com­
fort was a thing of the past. Within his brain a tempest raged
until its depths were stirred and slashed with the motley thoughts
of failure and poverty. Before his mind passed the buried treas­
ures, hopes and sunken wrecks of all the past years, until they
were cast before his mind’s eye upon the shores of the present.
Before the relentless hand of failure had grasped Gilmore, he
had been looked upon and described as the perfect man in busi­
ness. He earned honestly what he got—envied no man’s happi­
ness—glad of other men’s success—content with his life, wife,
and business. Tonight, as he nervously smoked his pipe, his
mind acted like a snapper-up of important affairs, and uncon­
sidered trifles; fighting out the circumstances of the life to come. He, after failing to
turn a real estate deal, owing to his not being quite as good a business man as he ought,
felt tonight like the base Indian who threw away a pearl richer than all his tribe.
Thought-entangled, hesitating in a world that seemed to him to be a strange mingling
of poverty and conscious inability to get on in life, Harry Gilmore, like thousands of
other men who have been an abject failure when brought to the point where brains
count and “efficiency” spells success, was reaping the sore and bitter harvest of suc­
cessful failure. Failure and hard times seemed to echo in his brain like the useless
babble of a stream that hurries by a ruined mill.

THE MARVELOUS STORY OF THE MASTER KEY
Gilmore knew his weak points and he had endeavored many times to overcome them,
but had never been able to do so. None knew better than he that—Talent and Mind
Power today outranked the wonders of the Olympian Gods. He knew also that Will
Power and Personal Ability are measured and mathematical—dominated by Prudence
and the Power of Trained Thought. Experience had taught him that—only those who
can concentrate their Mind Power can overwhelm the mental and physical beggars of
the world with uncounted .gold, and unnumbered gems of success. He also knew
that—weakness of the will never produces a perfect climate for the soul of a going
man or woman.
The storm and wind outside conveyed nothing to Gilmore except an abstract
thankfulness that he and his wife were where it could not reach them. While he sat
there wishing that he could obtain that “Mystic Something” which—makes the poor
rich and the common royal, the bell rang, the door opened, closed, and admitted—
Anderson.
Anderson, whose occupation was that of a drug and prescription clerk, had been
an undeniable and dismal failure. He was a prescription clerk of more than ordinary
ability. He had, however, been a failure as far as making and saving money was
concerned, having fallen into the channel traveled by those-who-do-not-succeed, and
had gotten into debt. Gilmore looked up as Anderson entered and was surprised at
the great change in his appearance.- In fact, as he remarked to his wife afterwards,
he hardly knew him. The last time Anderson had been in Gilmore’s office his clothes
were shabby and threadbare, and his general appearance showed that he was insolvent
and out of employment. Tonight, however, there was something new and unusual in
his appearance. As he brushed the snow and sleet from his new overcoat and hat, he
smiled and said: “Hello, Gilmore, don’t you know me when I am all ‘lit up’ in new
clothes?” Gilmore confessed that he was surprised at his appearance. Anderson sur­
prised his friend further by pulling a silver case from his pocket and passing him a
high-grade Havana cigar. Involuntarily he took it and beckoned Anderson to sit down.
Gilmore lit the cigar. At the same time he watched Anderson in stupid amazement,
wondering where he had obtained the money to buy expensive Havana cigars while
he himself hadn’t sufficient cash to pay his rent and gas bill. Gilmore also noticed the
great change in his friend’s manner. He seemed full of confidence, and possessed of a
Power Of Will and Mind, that was perfectly wonderful. Gilmore, no longer able to
conceal his increasing surprise and curiosity, said to his friend, “has some rich relative
died and left you a fortune?”
“No,” replied Anderson calmly, looking Gilmore steadily in the eye; “but I have dis­
covered ‘The Master Key.’ I have at last in my possession The Secret Talisman Of
Success. This is my mascot.”
“Gilmore,” said Anderson, at length, pausing while he flecked the ashes from his
half burned cigar, “I see that I have surprised you. It is not strange, for lately I have
been a surprise to myself and everybody else. I not only look, but feel like a different
man, and the change has taken place within the last few weeks. You know that I have
come into your office ‘broke’ many a time, and you pretended to be very busy so I
would not have a chance to ask you for a small loan. I know why you did it. It
was not because you were afraid to let me have a little money; for you know I am
honest, but because you did not yourself have the money to do it. Have another cigar,
and here is a fifty-dollar loan for you until you get on your feet again; this is my treat,
you know, for you and your wife have always treated me square.”
Almost speechless with surprise, Gilmore thanked him for the loan, as he needed
money very badly at that particular time of the year; the real estate market being dull.
After this Anderson was silent a moment as he looked Into Gilmore’s eyes, smiling at
the astonishment which he, Gilmore, in vain strove to hide. "Did you ever know a pre­
scription or drug clerk who possesses more knowledge of the business than I?” he asked
Gilmore presently. “No. Do you believe that there is anything In the line of my profes­
sion that I could not accomplish if I applied myself to it? No. You have been In the real
estate business for—how many—five or six years. Do you ever remember when I had
a good overcoat, clothes and money in my pocket until tonight? Do I surprise you? You
have seen for yourself. Next week my new business career begins. Within two months
I shall have all my debts paid and enough money to open up a small bank account. Why?
Because I have discovered ‘The Master Key.’ It’s now my Mascot. Within It I found the
Secret Of Success. Yes,” continued Anderson, when Gilmore did not reply, "my future is
assured, and I know that I shall make a fortune. I have been reading a strange and
wonderful book, and, since reading it, I feel that my fortune Is made and that I shall
now be able to overcome everything that has heretofore held me back. It will make
your fortune, too. You should be sure and read it; for you have no Idea what it will do

THE MARVELOUS STORY OF THE MASTER KEY
for you. Nothing will seem impossible after you know what it teaches. Its author
makes everything as plain as A, B, C. The very moment you grasp its true meaning,
success is yours. A short time ago I was in the very darkness of poverty, and my
circumstances, although I had tried hard to get a good steady position, were more
pathetic than the last scene in ‘Lear.’ No intelligent, honest, industrious man or
woman has ever felt poverty and failure above their head without being overcome with
a feeling of despair deeper than tears. Tonight I wouldn’t exchange places with
Carnegie, Rockefeller or any other millionaire. This may sound irrational and foolish,
but it’s true. The millionaire has lost his vitality, and spent his enthusiasm; mine is all
at hand.”
“You astonish and amaze me,” said Gilmore, looking sharply at his friend, the drug
■derk, and wondering whether he could believe his own eyes and ears. “Won’t you
loan me the book? I should like to read it.”
“Certainly I want you to read it, as it contains something that all the world should
know. It is really remarkable that its author kept it from being printed until now;
for every intelligent man and woman would appreciate a work like ‘The Master Key.’
Only a short time ago I really was in want. I was starving, slowly starving, while
seeking a position. I hadn’t any friends because I was ‘broke.’ I hadn’t any credit,
I owed for my room rent, and had no place to go for a meal. I had actually reached
the depths of despair and was seriously thinking of committing suicide. I had gone
to three or four prescription drug stores and submitted my references, but they were
handed back and I was told they had no place for me. Luck seemed to be against me
everywhere I turned; through my very blood and brain there crept the shadow and
chill of wrecked hopes, and unspoken desires. My soul seemed to feel the pangs of
every hell; for I had suffered that which sways the mind of every ambitious man—
failure. This is the highest possible truth. Whenever poverty and failure master the
human heart, as it did mine, before I read this remarkable book, it drives out all hope
and ambition. One cold day while traveling the streets for a position I found a
Prospectus telling of this book, that sold for $2.50, $3.50, $5.00, and $6.00. I was im­
pressed to send for the book, but could not, as I had scarcely money enough for my
next meal. That night I dreamed of this marvelous book. In my dreams I thought
it one of the most extravagant things in literature, and that it contained a ‘Magic
Secret’ so marvelously told that it almost seemed probable. The next day I sold my
Large Medical Dictionary for $5.00, and sent $2.50 to the publishers for ‘The Master
Key.’ I realized that this was my last chance—I was desperate, and every desperate
man will take a chance. The book came and I read it. You can scarcely realize the
transformation. Why, say, Gilmore, everything seemed to change at once—and
there you are.” “But what does the book contain, Anderson,” asked Gilmore.
“Wait; let me tell you what happened. I applied for a position in one of the large
Fifth Avenue drug stores where they do a great prescription business. I was accepted
at once, and put to work at a salary twice as large as I had ever received. Today I got
a raise.”
“Can this book do for others what it has accomplished for you? For example, do
you believe it would help me?” Gilmore asked.
“Help you? Why shouldn’t it? Your position financially is not as desperate as
mine was. Listen, Gilmore, and I will tell you what is in this marvelous book that
Railroad Presidents, Bankers, Ministers, Clerks, and even Farmers are raving over,
although, really, you should read it yourself. However, I will tell it to you the best
I can. It is like this: You see,—”
Gilmore’s wife interrupted Anderson at this moment. She informed him that the pre­
scription department of the store, where he was employed wanted him on the ’phone,
as he was needed to put up a doctor’s prescription for a very particular and wealthy
patient. With a word of apology Anderson left the room and went to the ’phone, which
was in the hall. Three minutes later, after bidding Gilmore and his wife a hasty good­
night, the drug clerk slipped on his fur-lined overcoat, rushed out into the storm, called
a taxi-cab, and disappeared in the direction of Fifth Avenue. Never before, within the
recollection of Gilmore or his wife, had George Anderson ever been called out of their
house by telephone. This, of itself, was substantial evidence and proof of a great change
in his life.
One day Gilmore was sitting in his downtown real estate office waiting for a chance
client when in walked Davidson, a former employee of his, but now a partner in a real
estate firm in Brooklyn. This occurred about a month after Gilmore’s memorable inter­
view with Anderson, which by that time had almost passed out of his mind.
“Hello, Gilmore, old boy, how’s the world treating you? Still selling lots of real
estate?” Davidson asked as he seated himself near the radiator. "Oh, yes,” Gilmore
replied, bitterly, with prospects of being closed up by the sheriff. “But by the accounts
of the newspapers things must be coming your way. Can't you put me next, or tell me
how you do it?” “Our business is good,” replied Davidson, “and things have been coming
my way, for a fact. It’s certainly very remarkable, is about all I can tell you. You
know George Anderson, the drug and prescription clerk, don’t you? Well, it's all due to
him.

THE MARVELOUS STORY OF THE MASTER KEY
“I was down almost to my last dollar, had sickness at home—thinking of going into
bankruptcy—looking for you, in fact, with the hope that you would lend me enough on
my note to help pay the rent and doctor’s bill, when I ran across George Anderson.
He gave me a book to read, and really, Gilmore, it is the most remarkable book I ever
read; it has made a new man out of me. Within ten days I was on my feet, and I’ve
hardly missed a sale since.”
Davidson’s words, uttered calmly, and with the air of one who had told the truth,
recalled to Gilmore’s mind the talk he and his wife had with Anderson that cold, stormy
night when he was called to the ’phone, nearly a month before. “It must be a remark­
able book,” Gilmore said, incredulously. “Anderson mentioned it to me once while at
my house. I have never seen him since. Do you know where he is now?”
“He is chief prescription clerk in a swell drug store down on Fifth Avenue, at a hun­
dred dollars a week; I just saw him yesterday,” replied Davidson. “It is a fact that
everyone who has read that book has done well. There are Martin and Lewis—parties
whom I know—you have never met them. One’s an insurance agent; the other a gro­
cery clerk. Anderson told them where to order a copy of the book. They sent for it,
and they have obtained the same results from ‘The Master Key’ that I have; and they
are not the only ones either. I would like to see a copy of this book put in every home,
every office, every church, every school and university in the world. It ought to be
printed in all languages and sent broadcast throughout the world. It should have even
a greater sale and circulation than the Bible. It really does bring about a Magical
change in anyone who reads it. There would be no better way to spend Carnegie’s mil­
lions than to put this book into everybody’s hands. It’s bound to help you, and it’s as
plain and true as an A, B, C book. It’s a most marvelous volume that teaches, and
proves what it teaches. By the way, I have an engagement to go to lunch with Mr.
Warren, the broker. You will excuse me, I know, and I’ll just step in again in a day or
so.” Davidson shook hands, nodded his head, smiled and was gone.
To tell the truth, Gilmore was chagrined. Again, he did not have money enough to
meet his bills. Going to a small restaurant, where he had often “stood off” the purveyor
of noonday lunches, Gilmore told him that he was hungry, had no money today, but
would like a meal. The restaurant man was on the point of leaving when Gilmore en­
tered and accosted him. He hesitated, looked at Gilmore, and said, with extreme cor­
diality, “Mr. Gilmore, I will introduce you to Mr. Browning, the new proprietor. The
facts are, that he had just bought me out. Allow me to introduce you to Mr. Brown­
ing, who will serve you and extend credit just the same as I have, and I’ve told him
you were good for any meal you ordered. By the way, isn’t Anderson, the drug clerk,
a good friend of yours?” Gilmore nodded his head. He couldn’t have spoken a word
if he had tried. “Let me tell you,” continued the ex-purveyor of business men’s lunch,
“Mr. Anderson came in here late one night about a month ago, and told me the most
marvelous things I had ever heard; stating that he had learned them out of a certain
book. I’ve just sold out here and am going to open up a fine place on Sixth Avenue—
near Twenty-fifth Street. It’s only one block from Fifth Avenue. Stop in and see me
some time.”
In a moment he was out of the restaurant, and the door had closed behind him be­
fore Gilmore had time to stop him; so he ate his lunch in silence, and resolved he would
learn what the book contained before he went to bed that night. In fact, Gilmore had
begun to regard this book with superstition. It had helped so many of his friends,
surely it would be capable of helping him out of his bad circumstances. The convic­
tion that this wonderful book contained information that would help him, possessed him
to such an extent, that he began to regard it as something magical. Returning to his
office, he looked up Anderson’s address at the big Drug Store on Fifth Avenue. That
evening on his way home from his office he stopped at the place where Anderson was
employed as chief prescription clerk, and found him leaning over the cigar case, sur­
rounded by a group of friends. Anderson shook hands with Gilmore, handed him an
imported Havana cigar, and asked him to join them in a smoke. Gilmore saw at once
that there was no chance for Anderson to tell him what the book contained. There
were half a dozen leaning over the cigar case, and he was the farthest away from An­
derson, who had by this time taken his place behind the cigar case again. Gilmore kept
his eye upon him, however, and bided his time, determined that when his friends de­
parted he would approach him. A silence, suggestive of respectful awe, had fallen upon
the party after Gilmore had been introduced by Anderson. Anderson’s friends all
seemed to be thinking intensely, and their entire attention appeared centered upon him.
The reason was apparent. Anderson had been telling them about that remarkable book,
“The Master Key,” and Gilmore had entered the place just too late to hear it. On
Gilmore’s left stood a broker’s clerk; on his right was a lawyer; while behind him,
stood a newspaper man—a reporter in one of the big New York dailies. Facing him,
at the end of the cigar case, stood a doctor with whom he had some acquaintance. The
others were clerks and men of wealth,

THE MARVELOUS STORY OF THE MASTER KEY
“It’s too bad, Mr. Gilmore,” remarked the doctor; “you should have come a little
sooner. Mr. Anderson had been telling us about a book; it is quite wonderful, it really
is. Say, Mr. Anderson, won’t you tell what you learned in that book again, for the
benefit of Mr. Gilmore?”
“Why, yes, certainly. I believe that Gilmore has, somehow, failed to hear just what
is in ‘The Master Key,’ although as a matter of fact I think he was the first one to
whom I mentioned it at all. It was at your home, Gilmore. Don’t you remember what
a stormy night it was? Didn’t your wife call me to the telephone, or something like
that? To be sure, I remember now; interrupted by a ’phone call from the store here
just at the time when I was beginning to tell you what was in that book. After that I
told what I had learned to several people, who were not getting on any too well, and it
did for them what it has done for me. It seems almost incredible that the contents of
a book could have such a great effect upon the success of so many men who are en­
gaged in such widely different lines of business, but that is just what it has done. It is
a sort of a never-fail-you book that can be warranted to help every one. There was
Johnson, for instance. He was with a large automobile concern and was eased ‘down’
and out. He had literally lost his grip, and was on the verge of giving up. He hap­
pened in here just at the time he was feeling very downhearted, but before he went
something was said about ‘The Master Key,’ and I let him have it to read. It had the
same effect upon him that it had on me, and has had upon everybody who has read it,
as far as I know. It’s the most wonderful book ever written—the results that follow
its careful reading are so startling that they seem like Magic. The man or woman,
who is a failure in life, turns suddenly into the road that leads to success. The mer­
chant who has been losing money starts to accumulate a fortune. The clerk sees his
salary raised without asking or expecting it. The public official gains friends and
votes—the minister sees his congregation increase—the storekeeper sees his business
growing larger by leaps and bounds—the salesman gets more orders and earns an
advancement—the banker more depositors—in every walk of life, the reader of this
book wins the goal of his desires simply because in it he will find the ‘Master Key’
that leads to success. Don’t you see what it has done for me and others,” continued
Anderson, “and how far reaching are its wonderful, magical effects? It imparts
knowledge that gives one that Marvelous Influence which guides men and women to
the top of the ladder in their chosen line of work. It never fails to bring results. All
who have seen or heard of it are just like Gilmore; they seem possessed of an almost
uncontrollable desire to own and read a copy of “The Master Key.’ I think you will
all agree with me that it is not the book itself that performs such wonderful things
for those who are familiar with it; it is what the author tells you in cold black print.
It somehow produces a Magical or Psychological effect upon one’s affairs that is in­
describable. It gives to one the Mental and Financial Elixir so essential to success.
Personally, I cannot give any scientific explanation of the influence exerted upon the
reader of this book by the author, although I have felt it.”
From then on Anderson’s friends entered upon a general discussion of what this
book had done for those who had read it. Now and then slight references were made
to the author himself, and they were just enough to tantalize Gilmore—the only one
there who Anderson had not told what the book contained. At length, Gilmore threw
away his cigar, and stepping around behind the show case, seized Anderson by the
shoulder and succeeded in pulling him away from the party.
“Say, Anderson, if you have any consideration or pity for an old and trusted friend
who is fast being driven to the wall owing to the need of money you will tell me what
this book contains. Fate seems determined that I shall never know it. You will
please tell me now, tonight, before I go home, won’t you?” Anderson, startled by
Gilmore’s intense earnestness, said: “All right, the gentlemen will excuse me for a few
minutes, I am sure. Sit down here, Gilmore, and you shall hear it. As' I told you
before, the stormy night I was at your house, I found the Prospectus describing this
original and wonderful publication, and sold my large Medical Dictionary and sent
for the book. After receiving it by mail, I began casually to study it, and in a short
time I became interested. Before I went to bed that night I had read through several
chapters, and it affected me strangely—as if I had at last come in contact with the
knowledge that makes one successful. It seemed to exert a vitalizing influence over
me as if it was possessed of a strong human personality; it seemed to possess a per­
sonal element that struck into my very soul. After I had studied it, and began to
understand its meaning I thought it all over. Next morning I realized that I was a
changed man, and not the despondent individual that everybody ‘turned down’ when I
applied for a position.”
Anderson was interrupted at this point by one of New York’s leading doctors, who had
come In and insisted upon him personally putting up a very particular prescription. “I
am sorry,” said Anderson, “that we were disturbed again. However, Gilmore, I know
how anxious you are, and as I shall be busy for the balance of the evening I will loan
you the book for a few days, as I have it here in my prescription case.”
Gilmore thanked him, extended his hand and lost no time in getting home with the
book where he could at last learn that “magical-something” which makes Successful,
Masterful men and women. See Next Page.

THE MASTER KEY
By L. W. de Laurence
Is The Name Of This Marvelous Never-Fail-You Book
Now Read This Next. The name of the book that George
Anderson gave to his friend Harry Gilmore to take home and
read, is “The Master Key.” This famous work by L. W. de Lau­
rence, one of the world’s greatest experts in training men in
Mental Efficiency, is fully described on the following pages. It
is a mighty good book and positively does all that is claimed for
it. If you do not find this literally true in every sense of the
word, send the book back and we will return your money.
Success And Mental Domination. Here is a book which con­
tains concrete, direct and terse instruction which really and truly
trains one in Mental Efficiency. It is a Moulder and Maker of
men and women; training them in a highly scientific way so that
they can rise above the mediocre individual to a distinct level
of Success and Mental Domination.
A Document Of Human Interest. When George Anderson,
the drug and prescription clerk, told his friend Gilmore that
everything seemed to change at once after he had read this book,
he simply stated what hundreds of others have said; for eminent
men and women have commended “The Master Key” to the pub­
lic as a document of human interest.
It treats every phase, and every quality that supplies that
“Magical Something” which gives one Will Power and Courage.
The actual “Par Value” of this Marvelous Twentieth Century
Volume, which has gained achievement and approval, cannot be
computed in dollars and cents.
“The Master Key” is a great book. It has a wonderful record. It has an actual
value, and this value exists, not in the paper it is printed on, nor the material it is bound
in, although it is well printed and elegantly bound. Its intrinsic value exists in the real
information its keen and brainy author has written into it. The book itself is original,
invigorating, and exerts a lifelong influence on the one who reads it. To the Efficient,
Purposeful man or woman—the man or woman with brains and ability backed up with
a sincere desire to surpass others, “The Master Key” has an asset that is priceless.

ness that the expert real estate man can appraise the value of a
piece of business property, that have not only recognized “The

book which would be useful to young people.
BECAUSE.—On the other hand, you find the Commer-
cial Traveler, the Clerk, and the Farmer who prizes this
book as a valuable investment to inform them about the
vital facts so scientifically treated therein. Here is a Lawyer,
to whom “The Master Key” is a necessity in his calling. Here
is a Mechanic, to whom “The Master Key” is so important that
he also sends in his order for it.
Bought Fifty And One Hundred Copies. Many business men, such as Railroad Presi­
dents, Bankers, Heads of Large Mail Order Houses, and Department Stores have

From Those Who Have Read The Master Key
Insurance Solicitor. “ 'The Master Key’ is splendidly conceived for the purpose in view
and is most helpful. If regrets were not contrary to its author’s principles, one would
regret greatly not having had this wonderful book long ago.”
School Teacher. “The Lessons and Exercises in ‘The Master Key’ are all so valuable
that I shall never cease from practicing them. I am introducing them into my daily work
and study with decidedly encouraging results; am saving time and also improving the
quality of the work.”
Doctor (M.D.). “A cursory perusal has convinced me of the genuineness and worth of
the book. I have nothing but praise for ‘The Master Key;’ it is what the world needs.
It should form a part of the curriculum of every educational institution.”
Clerk. “I have finished the handsome Volume. It gives the mind the power of gripping
the points of any matter arising in one’s work or pursuits.”
Patent Attorney. “I have read, read, and re-read the Volume, for I consider it a most
valuable help. The Chapters are of a most practical character, in fact the Volume as
a whole is intensely interesting and instructive.”
Criminal Lawyer. “Prior to taking up this Volume I had plodded through quite a num­
ber of books on Concentration without much practical result. The value of the informa­
tion contained in ‘The Master Key’ can only be appreciated by one, who, like myself, has
endeavored to gain his ideas on the subject from outside sources.”
Department Manager (Large Mail Order House). “It is an excellent treatise on the sub­
ject. To my mind the information contained in it is golden; if I had had the book in
my possession some time ago, it would have saved me much systematic study.”
President (Detective Agency). “I wish to acknowledge the receipt of ‘The Master Key,’
for which please accept my thanks. I have made a careful study of Parts One, Two,
Three, and Four, and have put several of the principles into operation, and I consider it
to be an excellent text-book, being clear, concise, and to the point.”
Librarian. “It shows erudition, special study of the subject, and much research, de
Laurence shows everything clearly, while others lead one in a wordy maze round and
round the point.”
Druggist. “My object in buying ‘The Master Key’ was to furnish my sons, who are
attending college, with the best work on Personal Efficiency, Mental Discipline, and Self
Culture obtainable, and it has been a great help to them. They are now able to accom­
plish wonderful work in their studies, as it helps their memory and develops their power
of Concentration.”
Director (Board Of Education). “Possibly it may interest you to know that, in an
opinion, which I wrote last month, on the question of education, I made a long quotation
from de Laurence’s work, giving full credit for the same to his wonderful Volume. I
make daily use of ‘The Master Key’ and find it invaluable.”
Ranchman (Texas). “I have had occasion to become thoroughly informed on the sub­
jects treated in this work, and for the information of the farmer and ranchman I desire
to say that it is worth the price asked.”
Jewelry Salesman. “As an old pupil of the First Edition of ‘The Master Key,’ I wish
to write you once more to assure you that I am still following the Exercises and still
making for all-around improvement in my daily work. I really believe I shall make this
book a life long hobby and am enclosing $6.00 herewith for a copy of the Last Edition
in Full Flexible Leather with Gold Stamping.”
Railroad President. “In comprehensiveness of detail, in scientific accuracy and in clear­
ness of instruction it excels any other work .of its nature with which I am familiar. As
a technical product, the Third Edition is a really great achievement. I do not think I
could have given a more practicable indorsement of this book than I did when, after
receiving my copy, I gave an order for One Hundred Copies to be distributed among our
employees.” .
Park Cashier. “Now that my studies are about at an end, I think it would be wrong of
me if I did not express my heartfelt thanks for all the benefit I have received from ‘The
Master Key,’ and as opportunity occurs I shall never fail to give you the recommendation
you deserve, which is, ‘Not to be beaten for honest dealing.’ ”
From A Member Of The Chicago Bar. “Both as a scholarly performance and a technical
product, the new Edition seems to me to be a reallv great achievement. Both of my sons,
for whom I bought a copy of the Fiist Edition, feel the same fascination for the hew
Edition as I do.”

is going to look to most people. “The Master Key,” however, makes it easy. By its
method you do not have to take a correspondence course, or master any of the text­
books on business. You learn from “The Master Key,” the same way they teach law
at Harvard. They do not oblige the beginner to master weighty text-books on law.
They require him to study cases only. If it is a law of Contracts they wish to teach,
they give out all the important cases where contracts were involved. By studying
these individual cases the student learns all there is to know about Contracts, and
learns it in an easier and more interesting way than is ever possible by the text-book
or correspondence method. So anyone can learn how to possess *■’’"*
Something” that “gets results,” not from advertising correspondence
intricate text-books, but from the simple understandable lessons
Master Key Lincoln’s Wonderful Common Sense
System Easy And Practical. The Master Key System is the easy and practical way
for those who really want to succeed. They used to say in terms of depreciation that
Abraham Lincoln was only a “case lawyer.” In this his critics were right, for Lincoln
had no deep or broad knowledge of the law. But he won most of his cases. When
Lincoln got a difficult case he probably knew very little about the actual ruling of the
law involved. But he had good judgment—wonderful common sense.* He read up all
the law that applied to that case and went into court and won against lawyers who
were graduates of the schools and far more learned in the law than he was.
Fables, Slang And Other Printed Effusions. There are Two Lessons in our Lincoln
Illustration for those who are earnest in their desire to succeed. One of them is that
those factors which raise the mediocre individual to a distinct level of Success and
Mental Domination should be no more mysterious to you than law was to Lincoln. All
the fine spun theories, the so-called memory systems and the correspondence schools
must get back in actual practice to hard common sense and truth. Your judgment on
these matters, and those qualities which supply that “Magical
Something” which gives one Will Power and Mental Efficiency,
after you have studied “The Master Key,” is more likely to be
sound than the $100-a-week man just out of college, or the one
who has paid a large sum of money for a Correspondence
Course. The alleged clever idea, the pretty pictures that do not
illustrate the product, the Fables in Slang and other printed ef­
fusions revamped from Walt Mason and George Horace Lorimer,
and the patented, jack-in-the-box advertising novelty, create no
desire to study, and convince very few that the so-called memory
systems or weighty text-books on how to succeed, are better
than any others. We make this point here because too many
men and women either regard success as something beyond their
understanding, or take the first principles from someone who
gets up advertising “stunts” to sell a Correspondence Course un­
der some such a heading as: “The Young Man Entering Busi­
ness.” “An Iron Will.” “Do It To A Finish.” “Every Man A
King,” etc., etc. Many of these bright ideas are clever, but they are usually not a good
investment. There is very little that is really clever or scintillating in any successful
system, and nothing at all that shouldn’t be clear and understandable to every one
interested.
Learn As Lincoln Did. The other Lesson, in the Lincoln Illustration, is the light it
throws on the best way for you to learn how to become a Purposeful, Efficient man or
woman. Learn it as Lincoln did. To do this you won’t have to pay out a large sum
of money. We realize how impracticable it would be for the average person to pay
$200.00 or $500.00 for a business course. This is entirely out of the question, and isn’t
at all necessary. As the third and final principle you must work on as a fundamental
basis in developing that rare brand of ability, which becomes a life long asset to those
who possess it, is the importance of getting the knowledge that never fails to bring
results. You can rest assured that “The Master Key” will put you straight, as its
author has laid down a Perfect System which leads to success and you will have no
trouble. You will, at least, be headed in the right direction, and you will begin to
acquire that knowledge which makes one successful. You will soon find failure turning
to Success under the Vitalizing Influence of this wonderful book. The book, itself,
really and truly deserves the commendation given it. It is a Great Work and should
be commended for the marvelous, well-thought-out system which it contains. It is a.
book which has been greatly needed, and in the hands of an earnest man or- voman,, i.tl
any walk in life, will show results in a marked manner.

The Annihilation Of Failure And Doubt
Mental And Financial Elixir. The chief contributing factors, which develop aggressive
business alertness, are, ambition for the annihilation of failure, and the development of
that characteristic promptness and decisiveness which is so conspicuous in all our great
business men. The man who has successfully annihilated failure and doubt is bound to
be of incalculable value to any large business concern and will command a very large
salary owing to his patience, his resource, his poise, his soundness of judgment, and his
possession of the qualities of high command in emergencies. Whatever the circumstances
may be, Courage, Self-control, Mental Discipline and Tenacity of purpose are the real
dominant elements of success. The heads of all Big Business Houses and Railroads
attribute the value and well disciplined cohesion of their high salaried employes to the
fact that from the start they have been taught Discipline and Mental Efficiency. Besides
the important reasons already given here for Specialization, Efficiency, and Mental Domi­
nation, there is still another interesting and attractive reason why one should devote
their spare time to some particular kind of training so as to develop that Mental and
]?iliancial Elixir which is essential to success.

or the office table of a railroad president. Here is a work that business men should
have fathered years ago; but it seems that we never get very far.in such matters unless
the effort is induced by pressure from the direction in which it is most needed. A re­
markable book................. if you want a book that will interest you far more than the
ordinary sensational books written by surface writers, buy it. Its personal and literary
qualities give it an added interest.
Convicts Of Failure And Poverty
Nothing Academic About This Book. The convicts of. failure and poverty will find
it a “companionable friend” which will lead them to success by a new and important
road. Many well known men and women have written their appreciation of it. Much
that now Mystifies men in rega'rd to the inequality of wealth is explained in it. AU
these ideas are dealt with logically and lucidly in “The Master Key.” The chapters
are suggestive and interesting .... have nothing academic in their way of putting
points of truth, but discourse simply and suggestively, in a cultured way, and with
tolerant, engaging freedom. The book instantly gains the reader’s confidence as it gives
the impression of truth. Many eminent men and women have commended this work to
the public as a document of human interest. A fitting tribute is conveyed to it in the
letters received daily from people all over the world. Study this book quietly, in the

known to most every educated man and woman in the world. In this book the Business
Man, the Clerk, and the Mechanic has a “Master Key” that unlocks the Door Of Success.
It Is Cheaper To Pay The Cost Of
Success Than It Is To Stand The Loss Of Failure
Reorganize Yourself. Many times it becomes necessary for the one who has been a
failure to reorganize himself, because it is he that has brought about his own failure
in life. Learn to conserve your energy, your time, and concentrate your individual
personal ability in such a way that it brings marked results. Other men have profited—
other men are making the most of their time and talents because they are filling positions
which demand Personal Efficiency. The object of this book is to tell you how to
become an efficient man or woman. Personal Efficiency goes hand in hand with suc­
cess. You cannot succeed unless you know how to apply your mental and physical
forces constructively in building up your success. Unless you have formed those Habits
which enable you to Apply your Powers for Success you are bound to be a failure.
This book shows you how to form Habits Of Efficiency, and should be in the hand?
of young men and women especially. It will help them to start right.
Truth Believed And Applied
Delivers The Mind From Many Mental Ills
The Message. This great book teaches the art of body renewal through the develop­
ment of an understanding mind. “Truth believed and applied delivers the mind from
many mental ills,” is the message this Volume has carried to the thousands who have
studied it. If you would know the Power of Thought to Strengthen your own body,
make a study of this book. You are, no doubt, aware of the immense success of other
men and women who have, by study, developed Personal Efficiency. Again, you must
know of the satisfaction displayed by those who receive big salaries; for they become
greater, and more successful every year. It has always been a surprise to successful
business men how many applicants for high-grade positions, which pay large salaries,
underestimate—or fail to estimate at all—the value of possessing themselves of those
mental qualifications which are essential to business success. Go seeking a desirable
position today, and you will soon find that all progressive business concerns demand
men possessed of—confidence—“mental ginger”—and an Aggressive, Dominating Per­
sonality. You may greatly desire the position yourself—but—that won’t do you any
good unless you are there with your particular line of Personal Efficiency, and can show
them what you can do. It is cheaper to pay the cost of success, than it is to stand the
loss of failure. It certainly will not cost much to send for a copy of this wonderful
book and thereby begin fitting yourself for bigger and better things in life. Investigate
this matter; you know what Marshall Field, the merchant prince of Chicago, said about
the man who turns down an opportunity without first investigating it.

THE MASTER KEY
The Famous Golden Rule Book
Exerts A Positive Influence For Making Money.
Sale Largest During Hard Times. Already man after man and woman after woman
have seen triumph of this wonderful and far-reaching Volume. A book so Dependably
Efficient as “The Master Key” leads its owner to form desirable habits of promptness
and precision. Such a book exerts a Positive Influence for making money on the part
of the one who studies it. It is a constant help, for it develops the reader into an
Honest, Skillful, Efficient man or woman. You may say you have no money to spend
for books, and that times are hard; they are, and always will be for the one who never
learns how to succeed. This book was created to help people who find it hard to get
along and has its largest sale during hard times. A man doesn’t wear an overcoat in
the summer. He only wears it during cold weather; for it helps protect his body from
the cold. People don’t buy this book when they are prosperous, and have plenty of
money; they buy it during hard times, when money is scarce. It makes them success­
ful; it helps them when times are hard, and that’s when they need a book of this kind.
Most Highly Endorsed. This wonderful book costs you but little,—it’s now sold at a
trifle over the cost of making and advertising—and the spare time that you throw away
during the evening hours will be well spent in studying it. “The Master Key” is worth
more to you than a Bank Note.
Across the face of every Bank Note appears the words:
“THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF.......................................................................Will Pay
To The Bearer On Demand.”
That’s the promise of the bank, but The United States of America, which is printed
in big letters on every Bank Note, stands back of the bank. The banker has the en­
dorsement of the United States Government on his note. We have the endorsement
of business men and women back of “The Master Key.” Plenty of written statements
which are an absolute literal and unconditional endorsement of this noted book. So
many testimonials that we could not afford to pay for publishing them, and they keep
coming from all over the world. The United States Government stands back of every
National Bank, and our guarantee and the endorsement of shrewd business men and
women, stands back of “The Master Key.”
The First Book Of Its Kind Ever Published In America
A Universal Key To The Latent Powers Of The Human Mind
Analytical Power. “The Master Key” is the first book of its kind ever published in
America, and it became at once the marvel of all who read it. The final evidence of
merit in a book must be the results obtained by its readers. People in all walks of life
study this,—the Eleventh Edition,—it teaches something which can be summed up in
two words—Efficiency, Influence. The Secret Of Achievement is taught, and you are
shown how to develop Analytical Power; from it you learn The First Principle for
success in contact with others. This book backs up every statement and claim made
by us regarding its great value;, for it is a wonderful teacher. It is one of the greatest
books ever published. The testimonials regarding it are inadequate as to its real merits.
It is a universal Key to the Latent Powers and Talents of the Human Mind. The
system laid down by the author reveals the secret of how great men have trained them­
selves to become Efficient; for ‘‘Efficiency” Spells Success, no matter what line of
business you are in. All authorities testify that our great business men are not born
with greater ability to make money than others. They develop Power and Efficiency
by training themselves while others do not. They learn how to use their gifts and
ability.
Commercial And Social Slaves. The average man or woman could develop that “mar­
velous something’’ and become a wonderful power; but the trouble is that they allow
their powers to lie dormant, and simply carry out other people’s wills, or drift along in
poor circumstances. They degenerate into beings little more than commercial and social
slaves—unhappy discontented, envious failures, hoping blindly that “some time"—with­
out effort or training—they will attain what they desire in life. Here is an opportunity
to save yourself from drifting along with the world's multitude of failures. This work, if
you follow the rules laid down in it, will re-awaken your confidence and stimulate your
ambition; it has made decisive men and women out of many who have heretofore been
-failures.
That Magical Something Which Carries One To Success
Study And Serious Meditations. Remember this great Volume is a “Scholarship” which
provides and supplies, the one who studies it, with that “Magical Something-” which car­
ries one onward to success. It is a book that brings “success” to young and old alike
as it helps them to break away from traditions which have only multiplied their failures
and wants. A work which actually and really exerts a vitalizing- influence over men
and women, who have been kept, owing- to their having been failures, from carrying out
their purpose in life; for it shows them how to carry forward their life’s ambition into
consummation. If you would obtain full growth of character and round out your possi­
bilities, you must cultivate the habit of getting away by yourself for study and serious
meditation. Get away from those around you whenever you have the opportunity. Keep
yourself to yourself as much as possible; if only for a short time every day. Full indi­
vidual effort, Special Mental Development, and Personal Efficiency all demand space,
separation from each other. These all demand solitude, just as the student requires self­
examination and that self-reliance which solitude gives.

Strong Animals Do Not Run In Herds.
The Stupid Sheep And The Mighty Panther.
The State Of Semi-Solitude. Great trees always grow and develop their strength
best when they stand all alone in the open fields. When a tree stands alone its
branches and roots spread wide; for it has a better chance to grow than the cramped
tree in the thick forest. The strongest animals do not run in herds. The stupid sheep
thinks only as a fraction of its flock, and is incapable of strong personal independent
action. The Strong Lion or the Mighty Panther, who lives in a state of semi-solitude,
is the most admired of all animals. The man or woman who grows up with the crowd,
sheep like, thinking and acting with the crowd or herd of failures around them, seldom
amounts to anything. In short they become as common as sheep tracks.
“Snub-nose” Company. Do you want to become Efficient and Succeed? If you do,
study and grow by yourself. Keep yourself to yourself by separating yourself from
the crowd. Grow by yourself, study, work, develop by yourself, with good books, good
thoughts and your own nature for friends and silent helpers. Then, if you desire the
crowd to see how efficient and strong you are, come back to it and you will be its
leader. A constant desire for indiscriminate company and companions is a sure sign
of mental weakness. People herded together do not grow efficiency; for they get too
much of one another’s “snub-nose” company. The young man who leans over the
pool table or hangs around the corner cigar store with other vacant minds, never
develops into a genius or a—“success.” Think how these, and similar lounging places,
dwarf the brains and souls of young men. No chance there for individual separate
development character Comes From The Farm
And A Real Lincoln From The Back Woods
Away From The Crowd. Thousands of young men have grown up to become sad
nonentities because they failed to grow talent. Talent, Efficiency, and Genius are
developed when you are away from the crowd; failures thrive best in the crowded
rush of the world. Many young men wonder why so much ability and strength of
character comes from the farm, and why a Lincoln comes from the back woods, while
they, flourishing in a great city, can barely keep their position as a common clerk or
bookkeeper. The young man on the farm is forced to be by himself much of the time,
whether he likes it or not. If he has anything in him, solitude brings it out.
The Stupid Sheep. Don’t grow up like a stupid sheep. Don’t devote your hours to the
company and conversation of those who know as little or less, than you do. Remember
that you are an intelligent individual, and that it is clearly your own fault if you fail
to obtain your share of the universal prosperity which surrounds you. Don’t be a sheep.
Get away from the crowd where you can act and think by yourself. Give yourself
plenty of room to grow, and grow by yourself, alone in the field of study and progress
just as the finest tree grows off by itself in the open field. Go out in the park or the
woods, and walk about and think and study. Go to your room and read, study and write
down what you want to remember. Be more with yourself and less with others. Talk
more to yourself and less to others. Avoid cheap books and literature; avoid excessive
newspaper and magazine reading.
Milton, Beethoven, And Bacon
Loneliness Made These Great Men, Get A Little Of It Yourself
Bacon Said, “My Spirit Hath Been Much Alone.” There is riot a man or woman of aver­
age ability but could make a striking career if they would study in solitude some good
book, like “The Master Key,” and at the same time Will to do the best that is in- them.
Proofs of ability due to solitude are endless. Milton’s greatest work was done when
blindness, old age, and the death of the Puritan government forced him into complete
seclusion., Beethoven did his best work in the solitude of deafness. Bacon would never
have been' the great leader of scientific thought had not his trial and disgrace forced
him from the company of a great retinue and stupid court, to the solitude of his own
mind. Bacon said, “My spirit hath been much alone.” This he said often, and lucky it
was for’ him. Loneliness of spirit made him. Get a little of it yourself. Drop your social
club, your dance arid theater parties, the cigar store, your gossipy boarding house table.
Drop habits and quit customs which hold you back in life.

THE MASTER KEY
For Public Speakers, Orators And Musicians
Never before in the history
of the world has a book like
“The Master Key” been writ­
ten, and if you read the amaz­
ing letter on another page you
will realize how true these
words are; for it shows that
this book has been the means
of helping men and women to
find their way to Influence,
Success, Money and Power. In
fact, you are liable to hear it
said, in any part of the world.
Read and study “The Master
Key.” It helps you to over­
come failure and obstacles.
Many have been foolish and
spent their money for books
on Thought Force and Per­
sonal Magnetism; have tried
one thing after another with­
out success; but it should be
understood that “The Master
Key” is a Standard Work by
a wonderful writer and once
you read it, you seem to get a
sort of a Sure Grip on. failure
and overcome it.
There is in life no such a
thing as luck, and the person
who believes in it or sits down
and waits for things to come
their way is very foolish and
is always found with a long,
sad face. If you wish to suc­
ceed, it will be necessary for
you to learn those Secret
Things that have made great
men successful and this is cer­
tainly and surely taught in
“The Master Key.”
Success hinges upon certain
Secret Things and unless you
possess them, you are very
liable to be counted among the
ba’ttie6 ofa”ifeS° Ai^Bi^suc! The Master Key Has Many Interested Readers
cessful men and women have
learned the one thing that this book teaches, it matters not whether they are a Merchant,
Clerk, a Lawyer, a Doctor, or a Farmer, they possess that Secret Power which leads to
Success, otherwise they would be tramping along the path of failure and disappointment.
The head of a large firm came to us when they wanted a book written to meet the spe­
cial requirements and needs of their employes. There are other publishers, all hundreds
of miles nearer this firm than we are, but they went out of their way to bring their
problem to us; and “The Master Key” by de Laurence, solved it for them. It has rendered
amazing service to thousands and thousands of men and women all over the world and
this is characteristic of every one of de Laurence’s books.
“The Master Key” Is A Guide To The Making Of Speeches. For the lawyer, the doctor,
the minister, the student of politics, or the lodge member, who may be called upon to
make a speech “The Master Key” is invaluable, as it covers the subject of Public Speak­
ing, After Dinner Speaking, and the composing of a speech better than any other work
in print. Speech Making, together with the Chapter on Personal Magnetism make “The
Master Key” an excellent guide to the art of speaking in public. No work can be so
valuable as this to the speaker who desires to improve his style; no work can prove so
indispensable to the man who is faced by the task of making his maiden speech. The
great value of the ability to make a speech is becoming more widely recognized every
day, not only by the ambitious politician but also by the business man who is called upon
to speak at public meetings or at informal gatherings. Speech Making is even of advan­
tage to the business man in his everyday life, lending him the power to speak with
coherence and conviction when discussing business with his clients. For purposes such
as these “The Master Key” has a value far beyond that of any book now in print.
The brightest thoughts of the world’s most famous orators, the humorous speeches of
the wittiest men of the English-speaking race, epoch-making harangues that moved men
to right the wrongs of classes and of nations—such are the words that fall from the
mouth of the public speaker who has learned to Concentrate his mind. Whether we take
the racy humor of that great humorist, Mark Twain, or the eloquence of Robert G.
Ingersoll, or the keen-edged wit of George Bernard Shaw, or the winged words of John
Bright, when he moved his audience to tears with his immortal speech on the Crimea, that
will go down to fame as the “Angel Of Death Speech,” we find that the great power of
these men is Concentration. Men who have been able to Concentrate their minds have
made great political speeches that have changed the policies of nations. For the man
who may be called upon to make a speech it would be difficult to imagine a work so
valuable as “The Master Key.” In this connection—namely, as a guide to making public
speeches—particular attention should be drawn to the valuable directions designed to
cover in every detail some point of public speaking.
The ability to obtain “mental equilibrium” has always been a distinguishing character­
istic of every musician of front rank. To take one example. The world-famous teacher
Leschetisky, to whom Paderewski and many eminent pianists owe their wonderful tech­
nique, based the whole of his system of Pianoforte teaching on the principles of concen­
trated thought and mental equilibrium. He demanded this from every pupil. Every bar,
every phase—its fingering, touch, accent, pedaling,—was subjected to' concentrated
thought, with the result that a student when he completed the study of a piece, could
play it by heart. The musician who practices the methods taught in “The Master Key,”
rapidly gains this wonderful power of concentrated thought.

“To begin with, I think it is worth more than double the money we paid for it;

Mr, Bancroft And The Bank Official
Several years ago, Mr. James Bancroft, a young man, was just beginning his career
in a large business house, and one day was stopped in the street by a bank official, who
inquired after the health of one of the members of the firm with which Mr. Bancroft was
employed.
Startled by the suddenness of the inquiry, young Bancroft flushed up, his eyes filled
with tears, his legs commenced to tremble, and it was with the utmost difficulty that he
made reply in a nervous, stammering manner. The bank official looked at him keenly and,
recognizing his distress, passed on.
Mr. Bancroft was very much annoyed with himself. He had no reason to fear the
bank official, unless it was the feeling of a difference in their social status, a difference which
modern middle-class life is often at much trouble to distinguish, and to mark out with
painful exactitude. And yet surely his whole attitude had been one of fear, or something
very much akin to it; for how otherwise to account for the flushing of.his face, the tears in
his eyes, the loss of control over his limbs, and his nervous, stammering response.
He thought the matter over carefully, giving it great consideration. He had heard of
people being self-conscious—was he self-conscious? Was the flushing, tearfulness, trembling,
and halting speech, self-consciousness? If so, it was truly a dreadful state of mind and body.
The years passed on and Mr. Bancroft, under the personal direction of the author,
made a careful study of the principles enunciated herein, until he gradually overcame his
self-consciousness. After this he quickly acquired a full and exact knowledge of his business,
until at length he secured a good post in his particular line of trade.
One day, in the ordinary way of business, he had occasion to call at a certain bank to
see the manager on an important matter. He was taken into the manager’s room and there
sat the bank official, now manager, who had caused him so much distress at the commencement
of his business career.
The wheels of time bring many changes. The manager of the bank was faced by an
Individual very different from the Mr. Bancroft of former days. Mr. Bancroft had
acquired an attitude of strength, self-reliance, self-confidence, an atmosphere of self­
possession, calmness and steadiness of manner that influenced all with whom he came into
contact. He had complete control over himself, and his words appeared to be measured out,
and carefully adapted with a definite purpose to the matter in hand.
The manager of the bank was also a very different man from the young bank official
of Mr. Bancroft’s early business days. The vexations and worries connected with his
position had told upon him. He was nervous, apprehensive, incapable of sitting still; he
seemed ill at ease in the presence of this self-controlled, self-possessed man of business.
Mr. Bancroft felt with a sense of inward pleasure that their positions were now
reversed. It was the bank manager who was now distressed and showed the painful signs
of the self-conscious state of mind.
How had Mr. Bancroft gained such control over himself? How had he conquered his
self-consciousness ? He had made a thorough study of the matter. He recognized that it
was as necessary to master the self-conscious state of mind as it was to master the intri­
cacies of business. He spared no effort, no expense, to acquire a knowledge of himself and
the best means to control that self, and now he regards that knowledge as his most valued
possession.
Are YOU—you who read this—SELF-CONSCIOUS? If so, do you really wish to cure
\yourself of it? If you do wish to cure yourself, make a thorough study of this marvelous
book, “Self-Consciousness In Public,” by' L. W. de Laurence ; the very same being
fully described on the following pages, and we can assure you success in your efforts to cure
yourself, providing you carry out the principles laid down in this volume for your guidance
and cure.
Self-Consciousness In Public
By L. W. de Laurence.
HAS NO CONNECTION WHATEVER with any of the publishers of
books pretending to treat on The Power Of Will, Will Power, Self-Confidence,
Mental Concentration, Mental Science, Poise, Personality, or Mental Efficiency.
It has neither predecessor nor competitor. It is first in its realm, no other pub­
lication showing the exactness and reliable information that it does. It is the
sole occupant of a new field and stands alone in its particular sphere. It con­
tains an elaborate system of rules and is noted for its accuracy and compactness
of instruction, wideness of scope, fidelity of truth, and positive dependability.

Read This Letter And Learn The Immense Value Of
Perfect Poise, Combined With Absolute Nerve Control.
The de Laurence Co., Chicago, III.
Gentlemen:— Philadelphia, Pa., August 1st, iqi6.
After reading the description of your book, “Self-Consciousnesss In Public,”
by DE Laurence, I sent my order, never thinking that I would receive such a
rare book. PERHAPS THE FOLLOWING MAY INTEREST YOU.
By occupation, or profession, I am an automobile salesman, and my business edw
cation, which was received in the city of Philadelphia, Pa., is considered a good one.
Since becoming a salesman, I have been thrown into contact with a large number of
men who control big business interests. My education, and five years of business
training, should have eliminated any Self-Consciousness or Timidity from my person­
ality; yet there has never been a single instance which 1 can remember when I did rtf'
become a little Self-Conscious, or feel an inward nervousness while in the presen
of big business men who possessed a strong personality. \
I always keenly felt the need of a master hand to guide me in my attempt to
overcome such disagreeable states of Self-Consciousness, so that I could at all times
be able to dominate a business discussion without a feeling of undue Timidity. In
fact, no one knew the value of poise better than I. 1 knew that great men possessed
it, and therefore were able to dominate d situation without appearing to do so. I
believe that all men of business realize the immense value of perfect poise, combined
with absolute nerve control. Experience and observation have taught me that it is
valuable to become a fluent and forcible talker whenever you want to be, whether in
the presence of an individual or before an audience.
Your influence in life depends absolutely upon your poise and force of character.
Your ability to eliminate self-consciousness really depends upon your thorough under­
standing of the whole subject of mental efficiency, and your ability to co-ordinate all
laws of the mind and concentrate them upon one thing. The explanation of Bashful­
ness and Timidity in this book is a revelation, while the law for developing a strong
personality, self-reliance and that courage which gives you a powerful influence over
others, really reaches its culmination in the hands of this great author. I have learned,
by studying this book, how to organize my personality so as to obtain the greatest,
amount of mental efficiency. I have learned how to speak effectively in public at a
moment’s notice, as well as to assume and hold authority. I can truthfully and frankly
state that I now, for the first time, really feel that I can hold my own in a conversa­
tion with any business man.
A short time ago I arose at a meeting of our sales force, and in their presence!
made an address without any hesitation whatever. Several times previous I had
attempted to make an effective address, but always failed, as far as personality and elo­
quence were concerned; for I always spent the greater portion of my time on the floor,
trying to overcome my self-consciousness. de Laurence’s valuable book, “Self-
Consciousness In Public,” has, in my opinion, more real worth-while instruction
printed on its pages than any book I hai>e ever owned, and this statement I make in
view of the fact that I have a library that has cost me several thousand dollars, besides
a number of books claiming to develop mental efficiency. I must ask you to please
pardon the length of this letter. I had intended to make it brief, but really feel that
I want to congratulate you upon the worth of this book, and the elegant manner in
which your publication department has brought it out. Yours very truly,
Publisher’s Note.—For obvious reasons, we shall not give the name of the writer of
this sincere testimonial. Heretofore we made a practice of publishing the name and address
of those who were kind enough to send us a testimonial. But owing to the fact that certain
Professors and so-called “Institutes” would copy these names and addresses, and annoy those
who allowed us to print their testimonial, by sending them in almost every mail, a lot of
cheap colored circulars and other literature we have decided to discontinue publishing name?
and addresses. The original letter of the above testimonial is on file in our office.

The Problem And Cure Of
Bashfulness, Blushing, Nervousness, Shyness,
Stammering, Timidity And Adolescent Fears.
An understanding of the cause of Self-Consciousness will show you how to throw off
Bashfulness, how to overcome nervousness, how to exercise Self-Control, and overcome
Adolescent Fears. The secret of a great personality is the development of Self-Confidence.
This book explains everything in detail, as de Laurence is known the world over as
one of the greatest authors and teachers of Psychology and mental efficiency ever known.
The book, in short, is a strictly high-class publication noted for its accuracy and compactness
of instruction, wideness of scope, fidelity of truth and positive dependability.
It is not a common book, it is a great work, by a great teacher. It is not a mere
summary of wornout principles, it is the great prophet voice of modern life and thought.
The book giving, as it does, the best instruction, tends strongly to produce and preserve
the mental and moral equilibrium of intelligent men and women. It is a work for the busy,
but interested person, for while it deals fairly and impartially with all sides of Self-
Consciousness; it is condensed, concise and concrete. All who read it commend its dignity,
fairness and impartiality; for it is a book fit for a law student, a college man, a clerk, a
working man, a woman, or any person in the different walks of life. If you are Bashful,
Tipiid or Self-Conscious; if you blush, lose your nerve, or become confused easily, this
book is indispensable; for it is a field of peerless help. It is first in its realm, no other
publication showing the exactness and reliable information that it does.
How To Control Your Emotions
When bashfulness has reached the state of timidity, it produces tragic consequences
with the moral and physical equilibrium of the one suffering from it. This is particularly
true of those who are constantly haunted by the fear of finding themselves in a condition
of mental unpreparedness. This morbid dread of becoming the subject of ridicule ends by
creating a nervous state of mind, and the life of the bashful person is full of boredoms
and nervous excitement. A bashful man or woman, who cannot control their. Emotions,
suffer keenly from the obscurity into which their defects have forced them. It is hardly a
matter for surprise that many people who are bashful become neurotics or break down
with nervous diseases.
Bashful people are met with in the most trivial details of every-day life. The mere
crossing of the street becomes, for the nervous man, an ever-recurring source of torment.
He is afraid to go forward at the proper moment, takes one step ahead and another back,
looks despairingly at the line of vehicles that bars his way, and, when a momentary opening
in this confronts him, takes so long to make up his mind that the opportunity of crossing is
past before he has seized it. Or again he may suddenly rush forward, without any regard
for the danger to which he is exposed, hesitating suddenly when in the way of the vehicles
that threaten him, and quite incapable of slipping past them, or of any quick or dexterous
movement by which he may avoid them.
This picture, despite its commonplace nature, is nevertheless a symbol. In the crossings
of life, as well as those of the streets, the man who is bashful and timid is at an immense
disadvantage when compared with the man of poise. The latter does not worry his head
about the traffic that blocks his progress. Aided by his will-power and by confidence in his
judgment, he stands firmly awaiting the moment that affords him an opening. Then, with
muscles tense and wits collected, he starts, and whether he darts ahead here, or glides adroitly
there, he threads his way through the traffic and reaches his goal without having suffered
from accident. The fears which trouble the bashful man are never his. His soul, dominated
by a well-ordered will, and reason, is proof against all attacks of weakness.
In the event of his not possessing all these virtues, he has the wit to keep the thought
of them always before him and to work hard to acquire them, so that he may become what,
in modern parlance, we call "a force," that is to say, one whose soul is virile enough to
influence not only his mind, but even to liberate his body from the defects created in it by
distrust of self. But, it will be claimed, there are people who are born timid and who are
quite unable to achieve the mastery of themselves. Every human being can win the victory
over himself. This is proven conclusively on the pages of this marvelous book which has
been published for those who are desirous of arming themselves, in the great game of life,
with that master card which is named POISE.

To appreciate the value of this marvelous book, it is necessary to realize that the
author, de Laurence, is a regularly qualified Member Of The Eastern Order Of Sacred
Mysteries. He is also an Adept of the highest repute in India, and what he has written in
this book has the full approval of his brother Adepts, who are the greatest living authority on
Talismans, Seals their powers and influence. This work is regarded as the most important
and authoritative contribution to Talismanic Magic that has been made within the last one
hundred years; and it will reach and benefit multitudes who could never have profited
without it. It is an Occult Manual of self-culture, and will be eminently serviceable to all
who obtain a copy. This book may be regarded as the crown and summary of the author’s
life-long studies and personal experience in the construction of Seals and Talismans. The
very same is of an importance which it would be hard to overrate. The student is given
the fullest and clearest exhibition of the doctrine of a Secret Mysticism.
Anybody can, by studying this book, learn to use the concealed Occult forces, and to
construct Talismans thereby. de Laurence has written many extraordinary books, and
this one is an able contribution to the science and study of Ancient Magic. The various
phases of Talismanic Magic, its philosophy, its discipline and its glory are treated seriatim
in this volume.. Here, is unquestionably a remarkable and even a wonderful book. It is
really a study in Magic, finally done by a master hand. This book deserves to be widely
and sympathetically studied.
A work of great learning. ... It will be found of great value to the student and
the searcher after a true knowledge of the construction of Talismans and Seals. de
Laurence’s careful and exhaustive labor in compiling this work is above all praise. This
book was written and published to sell as a high-class work for advanced students, and
should sell for $4.00 a conv. We have, however, placed it on sale at a much lower price.

This book surpasses anything of the kind heretofore published. Its great author deals
with Clairvoyance, Telepathy, Trance-Phenomena, and those communications which come
from beyond the veil; and is not to be compared with any other book on this subject now
in print. de Laurence has been painstaking, and his researches have been obviously
conducted with a mind hospitable to truth. It is a practical study in Spirit Psychometry
and Trance Communications by unseen agencies. An able and luminous account of the
phenomena and doctrines included under the terms, '‘Spiritualism And Thought Transfer­
ence;" their relation to modern science, and their influence on conduct.
The present volume has already run into several editions. There are few writers as
remarkable as de Laurence, who is the world’s greatest author and teacher of these
subjects. He has laid the foundation of a new spiritualism, built on evidence rather than on
the worn-out traditions of the religion of to-day. This book comprises within itself at once,
a practical guide to Spiritual Philosophy. It is replete with sound, scholarly, cogent, and
practical reasoning, on the scientific and religious, as well as on the psychic side, and may
well be taken as a treasury of Occult knowledge, proving that the Spiritual Philosophy is a
necessity for the future well-being of the world. de Laurence, on every page, writes
as an Adept and a Master. . . . Keenly desires to give truthful information. His con­
clusions are well stated, and are based upon careful reasoning and accurate interpretation.
A work that has been most thoughtfully written, and the truths the author wishes to
teach, are presented in a very plain, yet forcible manner. It is surprising we have had to
wait so long for such a worthy book, and de Laurence is the first writer who has
carefully explored the laws of Spiritualism and given his wealth of well sifted information
to the world. de Laurence is the world’s acknowledged authority on the phenomena of
Thought Transference, Mental Telepathy, Spiritualism, and his success in teaching these
things has been instrumental in obtaining recognition of the importance of these subjects
from the medical profession, no less than from the general public throughout the world.
The present book is for practical guidance and is of far greater value than the small price
asked for it. It is especially to be recommended to those who are interested in Thought
Transference, Psychometry, Auto-Trance and Mental Telepathy.

The Tarot Cards Tested By A Card Reader
The de Laurence Co., Chicago, Ill., Gentlemen:
Some time ago I received from you a Pack of your Ancient Tarot Cards for Prophecy,
Fortune-Telling- and Divination, and also a copy of your Wonderful book entitled “The
Illustrated Key To The Tarot.” After a study of the book and a test of the Cards, I
find them more to be what I have been wanting than any cards I have ever had, and
they are even better than your Catalogue describes them to be. I can conscientiously
recommend them to any card reader, or any one interested in Fortune-Telling, Prophecy,
and Divination as being the very best that can be had. I believe that I am in a position
to speak intelligently on matters of this kind, for I have been a well-known card
reader for about twenty-five years and am well-known in this vicinity. If any one
writes to you from my home town, you can use my name, or, if you wish to use my
name in any '■'ther way concerning this famous Pack of Cards and the Instructive Book
that goes with them, you may do so, for I will be pleased to recommend them to any­
body. Wishing you every success in your wonderful line of work, I beg to remain,

tise which presents in concrete form, the truth about
the Bible and what History shows regarding the dif­

with the history of the thirty years of Jesus’ life,

reports, that are both legendary and supernatural.
States facts as they are presented by the unerring
records of history; gives data and statements from
Eminent Biblical Historians, and the greatest au­

actual History of the Bible be ever published.
An able authority in speaking of this matter remarks very significantly
as follows: “Everyone who is familiar with the History of the Bible has
learned many startling facts, and every minister who has studied its His­
tory knows much about it that is never given out.”

contains which it would be impossible to describe here; but this much may
be said—it states facts and gives information not to be obtained elsewhere.
It gives the History of each of the Books of the Bible. You will be amazed
if you read this work by de Laurence; for he takes up the Formation of the
Christian Bible and tells how the founding of the Canon was brought about.
Again and again, he shows that research and exploration into the archaic
periods of Theology and primitive religion evolve some things that one
could scarcely give credence to were it not for the unchallengeable and
authentic testimony of qualified investigators and able historians whose
capability and veracity no intelligent person, who is at all familiar with the
matter, would ever think of attempting to question or overthrow.

What You Learn From This Book. You learn the origin of the Bible, and who wrote
the books that were later voted into the Canon. It tells whether or not they are what
they claim to be. It posts you so you will be able to talk intelligently about what the
Bible contains, and converse knowingly about its History and the Formation of the
so-called Christian Canon. The knowledge you receive is of real value for it gives al!
the facts concerning the History of the Christian Bible. Gives opinions, knowledge
and conclusions of the world’s most able authorities on the Bible. Contains the essence
of a large number of Compendiums on Ecclesiastical History. No other work gives
in concrete form, such valuable data and articles written expressly for Biblical and
Ecclesiastical Dictionaries. As an instance, it gives much of the Ecclesiastical History
of Eusebius, 1872 Edition, which was translated into English.

yet you heed them not.
It is well known among
Death brings every human being face to face with the
greatest mystery known to man. It is that which closes all
the scenes that lie between the morn of laughter and the
night of tears; where ends the false and true, the joys and
griefs, the careless shallows and the tragic deeps of earthly
life.
This work treats upon Death, Spiritualism, And The
Continuity Of Life Beyond The Grave. It shows that Spirit­
ualism is spreading over the entire world, bringing people
nearer to those who are in Spirit Life. That those who have
passed to the Spirit World can come back to us and are
with us many times when we have no knowledge of their
presence. That voices from the Spirit land are natural, and
that Spirit communications are as fully in accord with nat­
ural law as the blooming of the rose or the rush of this great
globe we live on through the viewless air. The fact of their
presence is proof positive of immortality. They come to you,
Spirits can realize your danger and guide and protect you.
Spiritualists, as well as in all Oriental countries, that the
spirits of the dead do visit and influence the living. Spiritualism has manifested
itself in every epoch in history. The chronicles of every age teem to overflowing
with narrations of Spiritism, as do the far-reaching memories of every human soul
which follows these facts.
Vision Among Spirits. Shows that the faculty of Vision among Spirits is a
property inherent in their nature. That Spirits see more distinctly than we, that their
sight penetrates what ours cannot, and that they can hear sounds that we cannot
hear. Explains how Spirits are affected by music. That Spirits take pleasure in
hearing music, and that for this reason music has great charms for Spirits, being one
of the best means of invoking them.
The Communications of Spirits with men are either Occult or Ostensible. Occult Com­
munications are made through the good or bad influence they exert on us without our
being aware of it. Ostensible Communications take place by means of Automatic Writing
or through the intermediary of Mediums who serve as their instruments. Spirits mani­
fest themselves spontaneously, or in response to evocation. All Spirits may be invoked,
the most obscure as well as the most illustrious personages; our relatives, our friends,
or our enemies; and we may obtain information from them, either by written or by Verbal
Communications.
Explain Spiritualism. This work, which is known as the “Handbook of Spiritualism,"
explains everything so that it can be easily understood. It treats upon Spiritualism,
Astral Forces, Death, Reincarnation, Soul Transition, Astral Dreams, Spirit Communica­
tions, Clairvoyancy, what the condition of the Soul is after death, relation to and how it
exerts an influence over the living.

An Aged Father Lay In A Coffin
Around His Bier Stood His Weeping Relatives And Friends
While The Minister Recited These Lines
BY de LAURENCE
O’ER THE UNKNOWN SEA TO THE UNSEEN SHORE
Does spirit vanish at death! Does death hold for us but the same unfathomable gulf of black­
ness out of which we came at birth? Is the future to be the same as the past? Is life but a
temporary abode on a peak that is touched by the fingers of light for a day, while all around yawns
an infinite, shoreless gulf of impenetrable darkness, from one side of which we appeared, and to
whose other side we at death hurry to meet our destiny?
We feel certain that both our material and spiritual parts are actualized by elements eternal
and indestructible. But does that something vanish utterly with the dissolution of the elements
which temporarily actualize both our bodies and our spirits? Not long ago, only a few years, I
saw an aged father lying in a coffin,—a pale, waxen figure, silent and cold. Around his bier stood
the weeping relatives while the minister recited these lines;
O’ER THE UNKNOWN SEA TO THE UNSEEN SHORE
“Some time at eve when the tide is low,
I shall slip my moorings and sail away,
With no response to the friendly hail
Of kindred craft in the busy bay.
In the silent hush of the twilight pale,
When night stoops down to embrace day,
And the voices call in the water’s flow—
“Some time at eve when the tide is low,
I shall slip my moorings and sail away.
“Through purple shadows that darkly trail
O’er the ebbing tide of the unknown sea,
I shall fare me away with a dip of sail
And a ripple of waters to tell the tale
Of a lonely voyager, sailing away
To mystic isles, where at anchor lay
The craft of those who have sailed before
O’er the unknown sea to the unseen shore.
“A few who have watched me sail away
Will miss my craft from the busy bay-
Some friendly barks that were anchored near,
Some loving souls that my heart held dear
In silent sorrow will drop a tear.
But I shall have peacefully furled my sail
In moorings sheltered from storm or gale,
And greeted friends who have sailed before
O’er the unknown sea to the unseen shore.”
I thought, as I listened, “Is this true, shall we greet again the friends that have gone before?”
The cold facts of science and philosophy are poor consolation in a time like this. Then it is that
but one promise can satisfy the longing of the human heart. When one lays a lifelong companion
in the tomb; when one looks/ for the last time on the pitiful, pinched, cold face, and realizes that
never, never again will the loved one answer to one’s voice ; then it is that the darkness of despair
settles down on the night of the soul. The desire to again meet the loved one may be but a
sentiment to which nature’s answer will finally be, if'not its gratification, the extinction of the
sentiment in annihilation; yet the heart craves but one answer to its longings.
Is it strange that the tired and weary soul, worn with its despair, should at times turn its
breaking heart to Spirit Mediums and those teachers of Occultism for consolation—to those mys­
terious beings that claim the power to summon the souls of our beloved ones. It is the con­
solation of feeling beyond a doubt that one’s dear one still exists, together with the love of the
miraculous which lies in every nature, that makes it possible for spiritualists to perpetuate their
religion. This religion requires a seeming miracle for the proof of its truth, but it is not the
first religion in which miracles have played a part.
A Sermon By The Late Canon Melville
The following passage, from a sermon by the late Canon Melville, is most interesting: “It is
unnecessary for us to inquire what these arts may have been in which the Ephasions are said to
have greatly excelled. There seems no reason for doubting that, as we have already stated, they
were of the nature of Spiritualism, Magic and Prophecy; though we cannot profess accurately to
define what such term might import. The Ephasians, as some in all ages have done, probably laid
claim to the intercourse with invisible beings, and professed to derive from that intercourse
acquaintance with, and power over, future events. And though the very name of Spiritism be now,
by some, held in contempt, and the supposition of communion with Spirits scouted as a fable of what
are called the dark ages, we own that we have difficulty in believing that all which has passed by
the names of Spiritualism and Sorcery may be resolved into sleight of hand, deception, and trick.
A Veil On Our Eyes. The visible world and the invisible are in very close contact; there is,
Indeed, a veil on our eyes, preventing our gazing on spiritual beings and things, but we doubt that
whatever passes upon the earth is open to the view of higher and immaterial creatures. And as we
are sure that a man of piety and prayer enlists good angels (spirits) on his side and engages them
to perform towards him the ministrations of kindness, we know not why there cannot be such a
thing as a man whose wickedness has caused his being abandoned by the Spirit of God, and who
in this his desertion, has. thrown open to evil spirits the chambers of his soul, and made himself
so completely their instrument, that they may use him in the uttering or working strange things,
which shall have all the air of Prophecy or Miracle.

From Blackstone’s Commentaries On The Laws Of England
Blackstone’s “Commentaries,” Book IV, Chapter 4, Page 01, Says: “To deny the possibility,
tiay actual existence of Spiritualism, Witchcraft, and Sorcery, is at once flatly to contradict the
revealed Word of God, in various passages both of the Old and New Testament; and the thing
itself is a truth to which every Nation in the World hath in its turn Ijo-rne testimony, either by
examples seemingly well attested, or by prohibitory laws, which at least supposed the possibility of
commerce with evil spirits.”
Exodus XXII, 18—“Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.”
Eevit. XIX, 26—“Neither shall ye use enchantment.”
Ibid- Ver. 31—“Regard not them which have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to
be defiled by them.”
.. Deut XVIII, 9-12—“When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee,
thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations. There shall not be found
among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth
Divination, or an observer of times, or an Enchanter, or a Witch, or a Charmer, or a Consulter
with familiar spirits, or a Necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the
Lord; and because of these abominations, the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee.”
2 Chron. XXXIII, 6—Of Manasseh is recorded, that “He caused his children to pass through
the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnon; also he observed times, and used Enchantments, and
used Witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards.”
V, 19-21—Lastly, St. Paul Mentions “witchcraft” amongst such “works of the flesh”
as adultery, fornication, heresies, drunkenness, and murders.”
“It is impossible to point to any period when the belief in Witchcraft and Necromancy was
perfectly obliterated, or to any nation which altogether repudiated it. If one particular phase
was removed, or discountenanced, some other form, substantially and inherently similar, eventually
took its place.”
The above by Sir William Blackstone, an English Jurist; Commentaries on The Laws of England, 1769, certainly
carries more weight than the popular opinion held today by the materialist who has never made any investigation of
the subject.
Death brings every human being face to face with the greatest mystery known to man. It is
that which closes all the scenes that lie between the mom of laughter and the night of tears ; where
ends the false and true, the joys and griefs, the careless shallows and the tragic deeps of earthly
life.
Spiritualism and Occultism is spreading over the entire world, bringing people nearer to those
who are in Spirit Life. That those who have passed to the Spirit World can come back to us and
are with us many times when we have no knowledge of their presence. That voices from the
Spirit land are natural, and that Spirit communications are as fully in accord with natural law as
the blooming of the rose or the rush of this great globe we live on through the viewless air. The
fact of their presence is proof positive of immortality. They come to you, yet you heed them not.
Spirits can realize your danger and guide and protect you. It is well known among Spiritualists,
as. well as in all Oriental countries, that the spirits of the dead do visit and influence the living.
Spiritualism has manifested itself in every epoch in history. The chronicles of every age seem to be
overflowing with narrations of Spiritism, as do the far-reaching memories of every human soul
which follows these facts.
Thei faculty of Vision among Spirits is a property inherent in their nature. Spirits see more
distinctly than we; their sight penetrates what ours cannot, and they can hear sounds that we can­
not hear. Spirits are affected by music; take pleasure in hearing music, and for this reason
music has great charms for Spirits, being one of the best means of invoking them.
The communications of Spirits with men are either Occult or Ostensible. Occult Communica­
tions are made through the good or bad influence they exert on us without our being aware of it.
Ostensible Communications take place by means of Automatic Writing or through the intermediary
of Mediums who serve as their instruments. Spirits manifest themselves spontaneously, or in
response to evocation. All Spirits may be invoked, the most obscure as well as the most illus­
trious personages; our relatives, our friends, or our enemies ; and we may obtain information from
them either by written or by Verbal Communications.
There is a great wave of spiritual light spending over the Western world, bringing man nearer
to his ascended friends. The horizon broadens and is filled with a golden light and warmth. Man
need not be afraid to die; for the soul there is no death, only continuous life.
There will come a day when it will be demonstrated that the human soul throughout earthly
existence lives in a condition where it can have communion, actual and indissoluble, with those who
have passed to the spirit world beyond, and that they can come to us at any time and are with us
many times when we have no knowledge of their presence.
Death is a delighted transition to light and peace with no fear; the dying, as the earthly eyes
grow dim, can with their spiritual sight look across the border to that higher life. Voices from
the spirit land are human and natural: for the only angels there are those of our friends and
loved ones. All superstitious dread of ghosts and the dead should be banished, as should dread
and terror of death, and in their place should come that sweet and sacred feeling of the lover and
husband described in the following beautiful spiritual poem:
“She is dead,” they said to him, “Como away!
Kiss her and leave her, thy love in clay.”
And they held their breaths, as they left the room
With a shudder, to glance at the stillness and gloom.
But he who loved her too well to dread
The sweet, the stately, the beautiful dead
He lit his lamp and took his key
And turned it—“alone were he and she.”
Our spirit, or our soul, is clad in an earthly body, and the spirits or souls from that higher
life are clad in Astral Bodies. It may be asked in regard to spirit manifestations and communi­
cations, how are these things done? Tell me how you think; tell me how buds become flowers
and blossoms fruit, cr how all live and. grow. All are as fully in accord with the natural law as the
blooming of the rose or the rush of this great globe we live on, through the viewless air.
The human heart hungers for the real presence of the dear departed. The tenderest sym­
pathies and affections, the deepest demands of the soul and the loftiest range of the intellect, all
reach toward the spirit life beyond and would make it interblend naturally and beautifully with our
own earth life. Communication with the souls of the dead meet these desires and should cause
a harmonious search for truth and light. The fact of their presence near and with you is proof
positive of immortality. They come to you, you feel their presence, realize their influence, yet
you heed them not, due to ignorance of the science of Spiritualism. Possibly external scientific
proofs of all this cannot always be had by the materialist, but can the human mind be measured
by a yardstick, oi' a soul weighed in a balance, or seen under the Western man’s microscope?
(Continued on next page)
184 THE de LAURENCE COMPANY
The yardstick philosophy of your most sapient scientists is inadequate in cases like this,
and their solemn head-wagging over what it will not account for begins to look foolish to discerning
people. They do good work in their way, but they cannot dissect a soul or measure God’s universe.
There are several things yet for them to learn more of; .especially do they need to learn two things:
That the Astral Spirits (souls of the dead) can realize your danger or weakness and guide and
protect you, and that to ridicule or repudiate what you cannot understand is what really wise men
never do.
The Western World is now entering upon a new era. The future will mark the past century
as the era of intellectual freedom and activity, of spiritual light, of material development and inven­
tive genius, and the century now opening as the era of spiritual culture and a more deep and inter­
esting study of the human mind or soul of man. Every one is anxious to learn more of the Occult
Powers of the soul, that mysterious and immaterial part of man, and those who interest themselves
in the study of Spiritualism will receive their reward, it is known throughout the world that the
spirits of the dead visit and influence the living. This knowledge has been in all ages an
accepted fact not confined to rustics, but participated in by good and intelligent men.
If human testimony can be of any value there is a body of evidence reaching from the re­
motest ages to the present time, as extensive and unimpeachable as is to be found in the support of
anything whatever that the souls of the dead do return. Spirit manifestations and communications
come to us in our highest and purest condition of mind. It is then that the soul asserts its
immortality. It demonstrates that your soul can and does exist without the brain, and is an in­
telligence still when disconnected from your material body. It furnishes proof of a future life for
which so many crave, and for want of which so many live and die in anxious doubt, so many in
positive disbelief,
SPIRIT MANIFESTATIONS IN MYSTIC INDIA
Spirit communication is normal to the open soul, and its highest conditions, are strong in the
sacred atmosphere or home and friends. Spiritual thinkers of whatever class or name may well
realize that they stand at the verge of a wide field, rich in promise and comfort for those who
have near and deai* ones who have passed to eternal spirit life.
One who understood Spiritualism and the Law of the Spirit World, said to a mother, heart­
broken at the death of her child*: “Be comforted; it is only a separation—a separation and not
a parting for you. The dead are not even absent; they are simply invisible to those whose timer
Sight has not been developed. Every time you think intensely of your baby boy he will be attracted
to you.” This learned man would say to his friends: “We do not die altogether ; our individuality
survives us, and while I am talking to you I know for certain that all around me are the Souls of
my friends and Spirit Guides, who assist me in producing these phenomena which astonish you all.”
Before he died his last hours were in a sort of trance, in which all his spirit friends came to
him, and he looked forward with exceeding joy, speaking in tender and thoughtful affection to those
around him, saying, 'T am now with my friends,” meaning his friends and loved ones beyond the
grave.
And this is true -with all who have died, and death, instead of being sorrow and grief, is
simply a beautiful transition of the soul to a higher and purer life, full of light and peace. This is
death and is as natural as any of God’s laws. Thus it comes, light and peace, but no fear, for
as our bodily eyes grow dim our spiritual sight is opened before us and we behold our ascended
friends and loved ones who have gone before us. We must be true and fearless and fettered by
no superstition, realizing that soul-knowledge is deeper than what the outer senses alone can
give, and be in that “spiritual condition” of mind which makes the soul open to the noble influences
which sweep through the universe. At death, or when the soul leaves the body and we stand
between the two worlds, light comes to us from spirit life and our souls are lifted up in joy and
reverence.
One instance among others which has come under the writer’s notice, showing the experi­
ences of the last illness and death of a noble soul. I attended his funeral and learned from his
daughter something of the last illness of her father, -who was over eighty years of age, with no
bodily disease, but only a weariness which led him often to murmer, “How long, O guides, how
long.” Healthful in mind and serene in soul he waited for the time when his soul would pass to
spirit life. For weeks before it came he had visions of his ascended wife and son and of other
friends who had died. His beautiful daughter, sitting at his bedside, would hear him quietly and
pleasantly carrying on conversations with friends and loved ones in the spiritual world. Occasionally
the daughter would ask, “Father, who are they?” And always a rational and natural answer
would be given. This was no fancy of a fevered brain, no excitement; but peace and cheerfulness.
Thus came his death, a beautiful transition, full of light and peace, but no fear or terror. He
had looked across the border and his spiritual sight had been opened wider as the bodily eyes
grew dim. Such experiences are frequent and are beautiful and instructive.
MIST RISING FROM THE DEAD BODY
A young girl, watching with her mother by the deathbed of a dying and dearly beloved sister,
says, when the end came, she distinctly saw a delicate mist rising from the dead body. When they
asked the priest about it he said: “You saw life departing visibly from the physical form.”
How many times have persons been present at the bedside of a dying friend. The eyes
closed, the last breath ceased and they thought their friend was dead. Suddenly the eyes opened ;
light came back to them ; then a look of surprise, admiration, inexpressible ; then it passed away.
The passing of soul, can be witnessed at the deathbed by anyone who can properly induce the
condition which is commonly called Clairvoyance, or, in other words, by the withdrawal of all the
attention from other objects and affairs and the concentration of thought and sympathy, as well as
sight, on your dying loved ones. You can then clearly see the separation of the spiritual body
from the dying physical form, as Clairvoyance is finer and farther reaching than the sight of your
dull physical eyes.
The spiritual body, which Paul speaks of, is the soul you see passing out of the body at
death. With it your personality is not lost by bodily death, you cannot be anything but yourselves
after that event any more than now. You shall not be formless and disembodied shadows. Yrou
cannot die. Paul says: “Although the outer man perish the inner is renewed day by day,” sug­
gesting the thought of an imperishable soul or spirit within the physical body.

Claims To Have Talked With Spirit Of Dead Daughter
We print below a letter received from a man and his wife who purchased THE
BOOK OF DEATH, HINDU SPIRITISM, SOUL TRANSITION, AND SOUL RE­
INCARNATION, and used de LAURENCE’S METHODS for holding a Spiritual Seance
in their home. They were visited by their beloved daughter, who died three yea^s ago.
The de jLaurencef Co., Chicago, III., U. S. A. October 17, 1928.
Gentlemen: We received a copy of de Laurence’s work, “The Book Of Death, Hindu
Spiritism, Soul Transition And Soul Reincarnation” together with his very Wonderful
Methods. I now wish to inform you of a very Strange experience we had at our home one
evening after following these Methods.
About three years ago our daughter died at the age of twelve. Since that time her
mother has been constantly grieving and has been greatly depressed because of her un­
timely death due to diphtheria. One evening, shortly after receiving de Laurence’s Methods
I suggested to my wife that we hold a Spiritual Seance, with the hope of being able to hear
something of our daughter in the Spirit World.
Although we have been interested in Spiritualism for many years, we never held a
seance until we carried out the experiments as outlined in de Laurence’s Methods. I must'
say, however, that it was the first time in my life that I ever experienced such a peculiar
sensation. •<}
There were four of us in the room, which had been arranged as directed in de Laur­
ence’s Method. There was myself, wife, a neighbor and her daughter. Soon I began to
experience a sort of a weird, mysterious feeling. It seem to me like some person was
coming towards me with the intention of addressing me. I felt like I wanted to speak and
ask who was there, but some strange influence prevented it. After this I felt like someone
was touching my hand. At this moment I heard my child’s voice speak in a whisper, but
as natural as if she really were alive and was talking to me.
She said: “Dear daddy, tell mother not to grieve on account of my death.” I was so
startled I could scarcely speak as this was something entirely new to me. I did ikot seem
to be able to move, and made every effort to hear something more, when my wife began to
say, “My daughter, my daughter.” She seem so startled that she almost fainted.
When my wife recovered she told us that she herself heard our dead daughter’s voice
and her message the same as I had heard it. AH of us now believe that there really is
something in Spiritualism and that our loved ones who have died may, by some invisible
means unknown to us, communicate. Yours very truly.

The Dead
Man’s Home
THE GREAT BEYOND
Standard Work On Our Future Home in Spirit Life.
This noted book shows that after “The Dead” enter their future home, in Spirit
Life, they live on in a disembodied state, with all their earthly feelings and needs,
but with a future before them of everlasting existence.
There are three modifications of the supposition that the human soul dwells in
another sphere after death. First, that all souls pass into a condition of happiness;
second, that the souls of those who have committed crimes are purged of their sin
before they enter into happiness in the next world; third, that death irrevocably fixes
the condition of the soul in a state of heavenly bliss or hellish woe.
The first is held by some savage races, and exists where there is a low moral con­
sciousness and little sense of law binding the community, so that few acts are consid­
ered criminal and every man therefore eligible for future happiness. The last view
is that life is the time of probation, and that the eternal condition is fixed by man’s
conduct during it.
In this remarkable book, THE DEAD MAN’S HOME, de Laurence has put forward
convincing proofs of this subject which has hitherto been veiled in mystery. This
book will settle the question of what the “departed ones” do when they enter their
future home as the contents which follow here will show.
If you have ever stood beside a loved one, who has been smitten by death, and
whose marble lips can speak to you no more, you will appreciate tills book; for it
shows that those who die meet the night of death as tranquil as a star meets morning.
When you stand beside the embalmed and waiting dead, upon which has fallen all the
darkness of despair and death, you feel within yourself the desire and expectation of
another life beyond the grave.
Part One tells. How The Dead Man Enters His Home after his body is placed in
the grave, and when the spirit leaves the body. It also shows what the “Dead Man”
finds in his new home, and what he does when he gets there. This section “pushes
the coals off the bars of hell” for it proves that after you enter the Home of the
departed dead you may take up that line of life which is most in accordance with your
present aspiration.
The Modern Hell
PART TWO TELLS OF THE MODERN HELL, and how the flames die down; how
the clouds of sulphur and brimstone roll away; how the mystical region called hell is
obsolete. Part Three treats on the folly of charity and judgment against the govei-n-
ments of man, which is a most astounding chapter.
The question whether our conscious personality survives us after death has been
fully answered by this great author in the affirmative. This book on the subject of
human immortality, or life aftei’ death, deserves to rank among the best of de Laur­
ence’s famous books. )
Get this book. You positively need it. Don’t hesitate, but send your order. With
this book you are armed to combat any argument or convince the most skeptical per­
son that the human soul survives the body, and continues to exist after death. Posi­

Hypnotism Is A Subtle And Strange Power
There is a subtle and strange power lying latent in every human being, which very few have
developed, but which, if developed by a knowledge of Hypnotism or Mental Science unfolds the
secret powers and mysterious laws of this influence and gives to its possessor an irresistible
control over other people, who are unconscious of it themselves because they have no' knowledge
of the existence of this subtle power of the human mind.
Opinions Of The Medical Profession Of The
Medical Journals And Of The Press And Public Generally
Kansas City Medical Index Lancet, Says:
"Hypnotism by de Laurence includes all that is
known in the art and practice of Mesmerism
and Magnetic Healing. The book has many
illustrations, showing some of the author’s re­
markable feats."
The Medical Standard (Chicago), Says: "This
is the most popular treatise on Hypnotism pub­
lished."
The Georgia Eclectic Medical Journal, At­
lanta, Says: "This is the best work on the
subject that we have seen. The author’s style
is simple and strong, and he tells in a straight­
forward way all that is reliably known of the
origin, nature and effects of these interesting
phenomena. The book should be in the hands
of all interested in the subject, and more espe­
cially the student or practicing physician, de
Laurence is one of the most expert and suc­
cessful practitioners in the country, and he
explains in this work everything fully.”
The Medical Sentinel, Portland, Oregon, Janu­
ary, 1901, Says: "Hypnotism, a complete sys­
tem of method, application and use, by L. W.
de Laurence, will be of value to every physi­
cian, for there is much valuable information to
be found in the work. The publication is an
evidence of the fact that in the investigation of
the occult, the human mind today is busily en­
gaged, and too, because it shows that many of
the mysterious things of the past have a scien­
tific reason for their manifestation, and that
many of them are very simple when once un­
derstood."
President Eliot Of Harvard College, in an
address to the graduates, Says: "I advise all
students to study the science of Hypnotism or
Personal Magnetism. We know of the existence
of electricity, wind, heat, etc., and it would be
the most arrogant presumption to deny the
irresistible influence Hypnotism or Mesmerism
exercises over others. The best public speak­
ers study Hypnotism the same as they study
logic or the use of words. A man without this
knowledge is at a disadvantage with his better
qualified opponent. The study of Hypnotism
gives you an understanding of how people atre
influenced by others."
de LAURENCE’S NOTED BOOKS ON HYPNOTISM
Are Described On The Next Three Pages
William James, Ph.D., Professor of Psychol­
ogy, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.,
Says: "Legs may be amputated, children born,
teeth extracted, in short, the most painful ex­
perience undergone with no other anaesthetic
than the hypnotizer’s assurance that no pain is
felt. Similar morbid pains may be annihilated;
neuralgia, toothaches and rheumatism cured.
The sensation of hunger has been abolished so
that a patient took no nourishment for fourteen
days.”
Omaha Bee, Says: "Under the title of ‘Hypno­
tism,’ de Laurence has included practically all
that is known in the art and practice of mes­
merism. The instructions and methods given
are the latest and most complete known for
inducing hypnotic sleep. This book will be of
great value and interest to the physician,
clergyman, lawyer, teacher, merchant and the
private citizen of either sex, and a useful hand­
book for practitioners."
Little Rock, Ark., Gazette, 8ays: "‘Hypno­
tism,’ by de Laurence, is the latest and best
book on the subject published. The author is
the most famous hypnotist and magnetic healer
in the world. No student nor physician can
afford to be without this great work.”
Bridgeport, Conn., Herald, Says: "‘Hypno­
tism,’ by deLaurence, comprises a complete
system of method, application and use, both for
the physician and the patient."
The Metropolis, Jacksonville, Fla., Says:
" ‘Hypnotism,’ by de Laurence, is not encum­
bered with a lot of unnecessary matter, but
dives directly to the point, and is interesting
and instructive throughout. It is intended to
furnish a working hypothesis and practical
directions for anyone wrho may be interested.
This is a great work."
Denver Times, Says: ‘‘de Laurence has
treated the science of Hypnotism and Mesmer­
ism in a very entertaining way. He opens up
a practical and beneficial field in psycho-thera­
peutics worthy of the attention of every physi­
cian. He brings out very beautifully and force­
fully many practical points in life and living
which, if followed, would result in great happi­
ness. The book is worthy the attention of the
thoughtful.”

ITEM’S MAILING ROOM EMPLOYE
Puts Steel Needle Through Cheek Of Hypnotized Subject
Then Thrusts Needle Through A Fold Of Skin In His Forearm.
We are indebted to Clarence Bennett, the talented manager of the Lyric Theatre for this
story. Had it not been for Clarence, the story and Joe Tim Burrell, its hypnotic subject, might
have continued to flourish for an indefinite period right under our noses, so to speak, and we’d
have known nothing about it.
Joe Tim Burrell is a slim young negro of 23 who works in The Item’s mailing room. That
is his bread and butter, his modus vivendi, so to speak. But Joe’s real claim to fame is that
he is a hypnotist.
Appraised of this fact by Clarence Bennett, we sought out Joe in the fastness of the
mailing room. He was busy writing down figures on an impressive sheet of paper, but readily
admitted that he was a hypnotist and would be glad to show his stuff in a half hour—as soon
as the waiting thousands got their first editions of The Item.
In half an hour we returned. Joe was all set for the big act. A sixteen-year-old boy, Carlos
Caballero, was the subject, or victim, or whatever you choose to call it. Joe explained that
the subject had to let himself go; if you didn’t want to be hypnotized, it couldn’t be done. Carlos,
it appeared, had ho objection in the world.
Joe seated his subject in a chair and folded his arms. He leaned forward, and ran his
fingers lightly down the boy’s arms from the shoulder.
“You can’t unlock your fingers,” he kept murmuring, “You can’t get ’em apart no matter
how hard you try.”
He looked straight at the boy, gravely, disregarding the crowd of spectators entirely, and
while he moved his fingers down the youth’s arms, his lips were moving, though you could hear
nothing. Carlos tried to pull his fingers apart. He strained, apparently, but couldn’t do it. A
curious dazed look was on the boy’s face.
“Now you can move ’em,” said Joe, making a swift downward gesture, as though he were
cutting an invisible cord. The boy’s hands relaxed and dropped to his side.
The hypnotist went through a few more passes.
His face was intensely serious, he never took his eyes off his subject. He kept talking to
him throughout the performance.
“Now you’re going to go asleep,” he said, and Carloss’ head slumped limply on his shoul­
ders.
“Anybody go a match?”
One was produced, and the hypnotist lit it and stuck a needle, which he pulled out of his
shirt, into the flame. The idea was sterilization.
Then he thrust two fingers inside the sleeping Carlos’ cheek, and pushed the needle through
the cheek from the outside. Much gasping from the audience, but never a quiver from the slum­
bering Carlos. Joe took another needle and thrust it through a fold of skin in his subject’s
forearm. Then he jerked out the needles. No blood followed their withdrawal, and when
Carlos woke up he did not rub the punctured spots, and was apparently unconscious that he
had been jabbed.
“What’ll I make him do next?” inquired the hypnotist.
“Make him bark like a dog,” chorused the enthusiastic mailing room force, who had seen
the act before.
The Grand Finale Of The Performance
Joe went through a few more mysterious passes and told his subject he was going to be a
bulldog in a minute, and run around snapping at everybody’s legs except Joe’s. Squeals of excite­
ment from the onlookers. Young ladies from the circulation department who had come in to see
the show hurriedly scrambled on tops of tables, while Carlos scampered about on all fours on the
floor growling and barking.
Then followed the grand finale of the performance, the thrilling climax, the office boys’ delight.
It was announced to the hypnotized Carlos that his body was going to become perfectly rigid,
like a bar of iron. He was to hold on to the seams of his trousers with his thumbs and fore­
fingers while this accomplishment was achieved.
More passes, and the hypnotist ran his hands lightly over the subject’s body. Then he
picked up the hypnotized boy, like a log of wood and laid him across the backs of two chairs, and
invited a group of office boys to come forward and stand on the subject’s stomach. The response
was immediate. The boys wobbled back and forth and dug their heels in to keep from falling,
but the rigid body did not bend under the weight of the three of them. Carlos, it should be ex­
plained, is an ordinarily built youth of 16, not at all the. professional strong man type. He certainly
does not look as if he could perform any human bridge stunts when he is awake. When he came
out of it, he rubbed his eyes dully, and looked a bit dazed.
Puts A Big Woman To Sleep
Joe Tim Burrell, the young hypnotist, says he got his stuff out of a book on hypnotism which
he got hold of about seven years ago, and as he practiced it has learned to do more and more
stunts.
His first accomplishment, he says, was putting several women of his race to sleep down
on South Rampart Street one summer evening.
A big yellow woman asked him to put her to sleep, and he did so.
Then, says Burrell, a policeman came along and began to take what looked like too much in­
terest in the proceedings, so he woke his subject up, and called the performance off for the
evening.
The human bridge act, and the needle through the cheeks was good stuff. Carlos doesn’t look
to us like the Spartan boy type who would have undergone either of those stunts without wincing.
Joe Tim, the hypnotist, says he has only been working with Carlos a couple of days.
It was a good show anyhow. And Norman, our talented major general of janitors, is filled with
dreams of wealth beyond the dreams of avarice. He says he is going to “manage” Joe Tim, and
put him on a colored circuit. We intend then to demand a rake-off for launching the young max?
on the road to fame.

Joe Tim Burrell, Of New Orleans, La., And

Both Learned Hypnotism From de Laurence’s Books
The article reproduced here from the New Orleans Item Magazine, as well as the illustration
showing that Joe Tim Burrell, a young man working in the Item’s mailing room, learned Hypnotism
from de Laurence’s books, are doubly interesting owing to the fact that many do not believe that
Hypnotism is something that can be learned from a book, de Laurence’s books on the subject of
Hypnotism and Mesmerism, have had a steady sale for almost twenty-five years and hundreds have
become successful operators simply by studying his books, de Laurence goes straight to the
point and tells you in a direct manner just what to do and how to obtain success. No other author
has, as far as we know, ever equalled him as a teacher.
Again, the illustration on another page showing how Mr. Solomon E. Forskin of Spanish
Honduras, Central America, succeeded in Hypnotizing several people at one time, after studying de
Laurence’s books is direct evidence that it is possible to learn this wonderful science so as to be
able to control the minds of people.
Hypnotism although one of the most wonderful and strangest of sciences is not difficult to learn
if you get the right kind of instruction from the start. Men and women have been Hypnotized, by
those who understood this marvelous science, in all ages of the world. Hypnotism is a Secret,
Invisible, Intangible, Subtle Influence which might well be called a Mental Power. This Strange
Power seems to be laying latent in the mind and soul of any man or woman who makes any claim
whatever of having a strong steady mind and a keen eye.
Personal Magnetism, which is one of the pri>ne factors in Business Success, is nothing else bu*
the ability to exert a Hypnotic Influence over those you meet. In view of this fact, there is no
question but what a knowledge of Hypnotism is a good thing to use in business.
The large number of Testimonials from Newspapers, Medical Journals, and Students, leave nc>
room to dispute the fact that de Laurence’s books are really the best published on the subject.
His books have simply supplanted every other book on the subject. Dealers will tell you that they
cannot sell anything else, because nobody wants or will have a book on Hypnotism unless it is one
written by de Laurence.
de Laurence’s Secret Method. It is a well known fact that de Laurence is held to be* one of
the best operators in the world and that he, after five years of stage experience is in a position
to teach you more than anyone else. Many years ago de Laurence discovered a Marvelous Secret
Method of Hypnotizing. This method he used himself with great success. People marvelled and
wondered at the results he obtained with it. This Secret Method has never been published in any
of de Laurence’s books. Neither has it ever been given to- the world. This Secret Method is now
sent free to anyone who purchases one or more of de Laurence’s books on the subject of Hypnotism.
Therefore, we make you the following generous offer given below.
We will send FREE OF CHARGE to every student WHO ORDERS any one of de Laurence’s
famous works on Hypnotism, direct from us, a certain Secret Hindu Method of Hypnotizing, known
and used only by L. W. de Laurence. This method POSITIVELY has never been taught or pub­
lished in the United States, and will be a revelation in Hypnotism. This Secret Method de Laurence
ABSOLUTELY REFUSES to allow us to print or publish in book form, but he has agreed to send
it SEALED direct to the student who purchases one or more of his books on Hypnotism.
de Laurence’s Famous Silent Method Of Hypnotism
The above sketch, by an expert artist who understands the great and wonderful possibilities
of Hypnotism, shows how it could be used by a detective, should he understand this science
and be called upon to arrest a clerk or any person who. has stolen money or some valuable
article. This sketch shozvs how a thief might be instantly hypnotised and not only made to
confess his crime but also forced to return the stolen article* The above shows how
de Laurence's famous Silent Method of Hypnotism, which is taught in his books, can be used.
THE de LAURENCE 4 OMPANY 193
30 YEARS AGO
de Laurence Cured This Girl
OF KLEPTOMANIA
By Using Hypnotism
From The Pittsburg Post December 5, 1900
HYPNOTIC CURE OF KLEPTOMANIA
A grateful mother was a caller upon de Laurence, well known author, whose
achievements in the line of hypnotizing patients that difficult surgical operations might
be performed, were noted in this newspaper some weeks ago. For seme time de
Laurence has had the woman’s daughter under treatment for kleptomania, and the
mother came to tell him that she believed her to be entirely cured.
On account of the standing of the people, who are members of a well-connected East
End family, de Laurence will not make public the names, but the circumstances of tne
case, as he related them, show it to have been a remarkable one. Having accomplished
the cure of an obstinate case of ingrained covetousness, he now believes it possible to cure
any bad habit, to convert a spendthrift into an economical and prudent citizen or even
to make a thief become honest.
The kleptomaniac case was brought to de Laurence’s attention several weeks ago.
The patient, a sixteen-year-old schoolgirl, was making miserable the lives of everyone
around her by her propensity for appropriating things that did not belong to her. The
clothing of her schoolmates and any other article of value which they might have and
which came within her reach was sure to be appropriated by her. The humiliation which
she caused her parents was so deep that they contemplated keeping her away from school
and any other place where she might have a chance to take anything. When reproached
and urged to give up the practice she would only cry and potest that she could not help it,
that when the impulse came upon her to seize something that was seizable there was no
resisting it. Th kleptomaniac propensity was seen to be alarmingly increasing, too, when
some acquaintance of the girl’s family who knew of her affliction, urged hei- parents to try
the hypnotic cure. As a last resort they agreed to this, and de Laurence was selected as
the operator to make the experiments with the girl. She was hypnotized six times, the
last being two weeks ago, and the cure is now believed to be complete, she having dis­
played no trace of the kleptomaniac disposition since the last treatment.
The cure was effected by HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION. While in the hypnotic state,
and her mind susceptible of no impressions except those which it received from the
operator, she was told that when she awakened she would have no inclination to take
anything that did not belong to her. This produced a visible effect upon her from the very
first operation, and it was deepened with each succeeding treatment, until her relatives
and acquaintances were unable to detect any further trace of the kleptomaniac disposition
in her. In speaking of the case yesterday, de Laurence expressed the opinion that there is
practically no limit to the changes which may be wrought in human character by hypno­
tism. It will be developed, he believes, until almost any defect of mind or disposition may
be cured.
He does not believe in the theory of duality of mind or there being one mind objective
and the other subjective, but claims that all minds are subjective. What other authorities
call an indication of an objective mind, de Laurence says is simply an exhibition of the
power of the mind to express itself through the five senses or to receive impressions
through them. When the mind is impressed through any other means than the five senses,
as by hypnotism, the impression can be made more powerful than in any other manner,
and it is thus that hypnotism is able to cure a mental disease, as in the case of the girl
just cured of kleptomania.—Pittsburg Post, December 5, 1900.
As shown above, this article appeared in The Pittsburg Post on December 5th,
1900. This shows that de Laurence was well known over 30 years ago. His books on
Hypnotism and Occultism have had a steady sale for over 30 years. Hundreds of people
have learned to know Hypnotism. They are using it every day. Don’t think it has been
forgotten or has become a lost science. Hypnotism can and is learned from books, but
those who learn it never talk about it. They use it to influence people to do as they
want them to do. de Laurence has written several books on Hypnotism and they are
listed in this catalogue at a low price considering their great value.
194 THE de LAURENCE COMPANY
OVER 30 YEARS AGO
de Laurence Used Hypnotism
For Delicate Surgical Operations
From The Pittsburg Leader September 29, 1900
I x SUCCESSFUL
HYPNOTISM USED TO CAUSE ANAESTHESIA
The Patient While Under the Surgeon's Knife Sang, Smoked, Laughed, and Told
Funny Stories—Several Tattoo Initials Were Removed from His Right
Hand—Grafted with Skin Taken from the Man’s Leg.
A very delicate surgical operation was performed upon Harry A. Hartogs, of 177
Knox avenue, Knoxville, last night, by Dr. A. D. Husted, of 36 Washington avenue, assisted
by Dr. C. I. Buvinger, of 750 Rebecca avenue, Wilkinsburg. The operation occurred at
447 Smithfield street, and the patient was operated upon while under de Laurence’s hyp­
notic influence. It was thoroughly successful in every detail, and was what medical
science terms “anesthesia produced by hypnotic suggestion.”
Under the surgeon’s knife the patient was conscious of everything excepting that the
doctor was cutting into the flesh of his right hand and that the blood was flowing freely
from the knife lances. While the surgeon operated, Hartogs sang, smoked, told funny
stories, and, in fact, did everything the Adept and High Caste Yoghi of India desired
him to do.
Seventy or eighty physicians and other professional men and women witnessed the
operation. It was one of skin grafting—one of the most delicate known to medical science
■—for the purpose of removing several large tattoo initials on the right hand, between the
thumb and first finger.
The patient was hypnotized at 9:30 p. m. de Laurence gazed into the pupils of the
patient’s eyes. After a few preliminary remarks, de Laurence said:
“In a minute you’ll commence to grow drowsy. You will fall into a sleep, and
will go deeper, deeper, and deeper. Now you are asleep; in a dead sleep.”
After going under the spell the bandage was removed. Hartogs looked weary.
His eyelids had dropped and was fast asleep. While bandaged the hypnotist stood
before him, then beside him, and finally to the rear of him. When he stretched forth
his hand, and allowed his gaze to wander toward the head of his patient that seem­
ingly inanimate person swayed, always falling where the Hypnotic influence of the
operator attracted him. His form was made rigid at the suggestion of the hypnotist.
Arms were extended and remained in that position for ten minutes. Then the body,
rigid as a bar of iron, was lifted by two men. The neck was placed over the back of a
chair and the feet in a similar position on another chair. The hypnotist stood on the
cataleptic body and sat upon it, but the rigid attitude remained.
“In a minute you will go into a deeper sleep, but your eyes will open. At the
same time you’ll remain asleep. You will go to the washstand, pull up your sleeves
and wash your right arm until it is perfectly clean. This will all happen while I count
three.”
At the given signal the patient’s eyes opened. They appeared dull and glassy.
Hartogs, as if in a trance, staggered toward the sink and fulfilled orders. Then he
walked back to the former position, where he was again confronted by the hypnotic
eyes and the magnetic finger.
“You see this finger. Now, no matter how you try you cannot keep your eyes
from it. Where the finger goes so also must you.”
(Continued on Next Page)
THE de LAURENCE COMPANY 195
And the patient did. Then Hartogs was told that his right arm was not subject
to pain from the elbow down. “If anything happens to you, if you should be run over
by a car, your arm will not bleed and you will feel no pain,” he suggested.
The patient said he had no intention of falling under a street car. Then for his
joke he was put to sleep and while in the second trance was told that when he again
opened his eyes no feeling would be in the right arm, that it would not be' sensitive
to pain.
When his eyes opened he was handed a needle and told to stick it into his left
arm. He did so and howled. Then he was asked to try the right arm, but only demon­
strated surprise that the sharp needle did not sting and that blood did not flow.
Several times he stuck the needle into the flesh. He said his arm was like a board, and
had no feeling, de Laurence at this point took the needle and buried it almost to the
eye in the patient’s arm. Afterward it was stuck through the flesh, both ends being
visible to the physicians and spectators.
Hartogs was told that when he opened his eyes he would imagine he saw a big
bird on the wall. Then it would fly under his arm. Under no circumstances was he to
lift the arm or attempt to do so. He was told that he would hear sweet musical sounds;
that all the people near him were musicians, and that they would accompany him in
any piece he cared to sing.
Hartogs again opened his eyes and in a baritone voice commenced to sing a song
that was Greek to the audience. Then “Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage” was sung. He
pointed toward the wall, and commenced to whistle for the imaginary bird he had been
serenading.
Dr. A. D. Husted by this time had his surgical instruments ready and was cutting
in the flesh where the indelible tattoo marks appeared. Hartogs lay back and smoked,
laughed and told stories. His face had a healthy hue, and there was not a tremor to
indicate nervousness or a knowledge that the blood was dripping from his hand.
Later it was suggested to the patient that his right leg was numb and that he
could not move it. When the needle test was applied he said he could not feel pain.
Under this condition about three inches of skin was lifted, which was transferred to
the right arm. The operation lasted for about an hour. Before it was concluded, the
hypnotist made his patient believe that he was riding in a balloon; that he was reading
novels, nursing a baby, and doing other silly things. Occasionally he was put into deep
sleep. Several physicians present were astounded by what they beheld.
Besides the physicians mentioned above, Dr. A. L. Slonaker, of No. 2122 Penn
avenue, Dr. Harry C. Wood, and others witnessed the operation.
After he regained his normal senses the patient said he had been ignorant of all
that transpired while asleep. He claimed the arm did not hurt and he had no pain in
the leg. He was brought out of the spell about midnight, after being under the influ­
ence for two hours and a half. After the operation Hartogs was sent into the clair­
voyant stage at the suggestion of two spiritualists in the audience. He was asked to
try and find out if a certain patient at Marshalsea had not committed suicide the day
before. He said he was unable to learn of any suicide at the city poor farm, although
he described the place accurately.
In bringing his patient out of the trance de Laurence only occupied a moment
or two. Then Hartogs’ mind resumed where it left off before he went into the trance.—

Wants To Enter de Laurence’s Great Occult School
Ottumwa, Iowa, November 13th, 1916.
The de Laurence Co., Gentlemen:
Attached you will find another order for books and materials for making a “Magic
Mirror.” Words cannot express the satisfaction and the Supreme Happiness that I have
enjoyed since studying some of de Laurence’s books—especially “The Great Book Of Mag­
ical Art, Hindu Magic And East Indian Occultism.” . de Laurence’s books have been the
Salvation of my soul and, by studying them, my whole life has been completely changed.
Oh! how my soul responds to this Great Man’s teachings, for I am one of his sincere
Disciples. I am going into his teachings right, and I would like to know what is necessary
to qualify as a student of his Great Occult School. Faithfully yours.
P. S. I notice that you sometimes publish letters sent you by students bearing testimony
about your books, and if the above letter will be of any help to you, you may use it. You
may feel assured that I am only glad of the opportunity to recommend such a noble work.
I know from my own experience that no man can be a failure that will earnestly study
de Laurence’s books and follow his teachings.

MEN AND WOMEN CAN BE HYPNOTIZED
That men and women can be Hypnotized there is no doubt whatever.
That hypnotism is a Secret, Invisible, Intangible, Subtle Influence or
power lying latent in every man and woman, is generally conceded.
That a person who is hypnotized can be made to do anything that the
hypnotist wishes, can be proven by witnesses.
That hypnotic influence and personal magnetism are prime factors in
business success is a matter admitting of little argument.
Therefore, hypnotism is a good thing in life and business, and all who
have the opportunity should learn how to exert this influence.
These are my propositions.
The only objection you can take to them, after reading them, is that they
are new, and therefore objects of suspicion.
BUT WAIT !
Have you ever been able to define that subtle influence which causes a
man—just as often as a woman—to buy things at Smith’s when it is fully
well known that just as good and cheaper things exist at Brown’s, a place
perhaps more convenient?
Or have you ever been able to make clear to yourself why people pur­
chase such and such an article merely because they have been influenced to
do so?
YOU HAVEN’T.
Those who have developed hypnotic power wield this unseen influence
over those whom they come in contact with.
In Toledo, Ohio, not long ago a girl, the daughter of a wealthy Monroe
Street merchant, was taken to Dayton and wedded while in a hypnotic trance,
by a student of Hypnotism. After the spell had been removed, she telegraphed
her father to come and get her.
THEN THERE WAS A NEWSPAPER SENSATION.
Still there are some who say they don’t believe in Hypnotism.
They ought to travel in India a while.
These pages contain Testimonials from Newspapers, Medical Journals, Physi­
cians, Private Students, Spiritualists, Business Men and Women in every walk of life
from all over the world, recommending de Laurence’s books. We have hundreds of
Testimonials which have never been published. We receive letters every day telling
how wonderful his books are and how people have been 'helped by studying them. Now,
judge for yourself, it is up to you to decide which you want, Failure or Success. Start
to study de Laurence’s books and no doubt you will become Successful and Prosperous
as hundreds of others have. You can’t get anywhere by reading and studying books
that don’t help you. In short if you want the host books order de Laurence’s.

HYPNOTISM USED
Clinton, Indiana, Oct. 1'2, 1916.
de Laurence, Chicago, HI., Dear Sir:
I have just finished your book on Hypnotism and I believe that great good will result
from its use.
I had a friend who was a drinking man and on one occasion he was in the first stage of
Delirium Tremens. The Physician could not quiet him, and he had not slept for 4 days.
I had heard of Hypnotism but did not know it was ever used in such cases, but finally
decided to see if I could get him to sleep. After trying for several minutes I succeeded
almost beyond my own expectations. When he awoke the next morning* the only trace of
illness was a slight weakness.
I decided then and there -to study the science of Hypnotism; for I believe great good
can be accomplished by its use. Therefore, I am applying to you for your Secret Methods
and any information or assistance you can give me1 as to the best way to gain an efficient
ability in the use of Hypnotism. Respectfully yours,
Publisher’s Note. For obvious reasons the name of the writer is withheld, but the above

These are just a few samples of the hundreds and hundreds of
questions this Oracle of Life And Destiny answers.
Answers questions concerning children born on any day of the
week. For example: The child born on Sunday shall be long of
life, and obtain riches. If you wish to know the Fate and Destiny
of a child born on any day of the week read this Book of Fate as it is gifted with every
requisite variety of response to each and any question you may ever ask.
No matter what your business is, whether you are a clerk or a farmer, a lawyer or a
doctor, married or single, old or young, male or female, Catholic or Protestant, Jew or
Gentile, no matter what your Nationality, Creed or Belief is, if you want to ask a question
regarding some person or circumstances you should order this book. It is a real friend
who will answer any question or give you valuable information.
Fortunate And Unfortunate Days Of Each Month. An Example: In September there are
5 days which are very fortunate and 2 certain days which are very unfortunate. In Jan­
uary there are 6 days which are fortunate and 7 days which are very unfortunate. This
remarkable book tells you the fortunate and unfortunate days of each month of the year.
Important Days. Tells all about every day in the week, and what to do and what not to
do on certain days. An example: If you put on a new suit of clothes on Sunday, you
will experience happiness and ease. If on Saturday, you will experience misfortunes.
Important Advice To Females. It has even been observed, and experience has shown
the observation to be a true one, that some event of great importance is sure to happen to a
woman around her thirty-first birthday. This will have a great effect upon her future.
Advice To Males. This also applies to men in their forty-second year, of which there are
so many ineidents that there is not a doubt of its truth. This book tells all about this.
Planetary Table. This wonderful table is a full page illustration and is easily operated.
By its operation you may know the following: Whether you are born for a third mar­
riage chain, to have money, children, voyage at sea, false friend or false lover. Will you
better yourself by marriage, are there flowers or thorns in your path. Will you be rich,
will your mate be ill-tempered. Will you have a quarrel with your lover, will you have
an early marriage. Will you be successful. Much information of this nature is given
in that section which deals with the Oracle of Destiny, that is, your future.
Next Comes The Trial Of Destiny. It is really a terrestrial table and is a full page
illustration. Tells what your relatives will do to you, will they degrade you or exhalt you.
What your offspring will be. Informs you regarding Love, Courtship, Marriage, Children,
Relatives, Trade, Fortune, Speculation, Success In Lottery, Fortunate Cards, Chance, Luck,
Good Tidings, Gifts, Money, Bad Things, etc., etc.
Chiromancy, Or Fortune Telling By The Hand. Chiromancy is the art of reading in
the hand the character and fortune of an individual. There are certain lines in the human
hand which indicate the length of their life, their disposition and real nature. If you
study this section you will learn just what a person is by the lines and signs in their hand.
Whether they are ill-tempered, healthy, positive, easy going, weak minded, timid, or
strong. Wether they will have a long life and whether they will be healthy or have a
great deal of sickness. In fact, everything that is worth knowing about Palmistry is
clearly set forth and easily learned from this book.
Moles: Have you one or more moles upon your body. A mole is a very significant mark
on the body and a remarkable guide either, to the success or failure of the one upon
whose body it appears. An example: A mole on your forehead means that you have wis­
dom and would be successful in the management of business affairs. A mole on your
right cheek means that you will be loved and have money. If you have a mole on your
left shoulder you will know sorrow and labor a-plenty. This is only another example
of the wonderful information contained in this book.
Weather Omens. It tells you how to be a weather judge or a prophet so that you will
know when the weather is going to be fine and how long continued. An example: Nice
weather will be of short duration if the. full moon rise clear.
If there be red clouds in the west at sunset, it will be fine; if they have a tint of purple,
it will be very fine; or if red, bordered with black in the south-east, the weather will only
be nice for one or two days.
If spiders work in the morning early at their webs, there will be a fine day.
If gnats fly in compact bodies in the beams of the setting sun, there will be fine weather.
Rainy And Showery Weather. When the sky, in rainy weather, is tinged with sea green,
the rain will increase; if with deep blue, it will be showery.
Wet Weather. If the sun rise pale, pale red, or even dark blue, there will be rain during
tixe day. (Continued On Next Page)
THE de LAURENCE COMPANY 201
de Laurence’s Oracle Of Life And Destiny
If the sun rise covered with a dark-spotted cloud; rain the same day.
If the sun set pale or purple; rain or wind the following day.
If there be a change of the wind from the north-west or west, to the south-west or
south, or else from the north-east or east, to the south-east or south; wet.
Stormy Weather. If the clouds be of different heights, the sky above being grayish
or dirty blue, with hardly any wind stirring; the wind, however, changing from W. to S.,
or sometimes to S. E., without perceptibly Increasing in force.
If porpoises and whales sport about ships. If sea-gulls and other birds fly inland.
Storms are most frequent in December, January and February. In September, there are
generally one or two storms. If it blow in the day, it generally hushes toward evening;
but if it continue blowing, it may be expected to continue. The vernal equinoctial gales
are stronger than the autumnal.
In this section of this wonderful Oracle of Life And Destiny you are shown all of the
weather omens and signs which tell just what kind of weather you will have. Whether
it will be stormy, rainy, thunder, colder, or warmer. Whether there will be a frost or a
thaw. It is very important to know all the weather signs.
Celestial Palmistry. This section fully explains the relation of the moon to the Destiny
of humans. Read this: A child born within 24 hours after the New Moon, will be for­
tunate, and live to a good old age.
A child born on this day will also be fortunate through persons in power. The fourth
day after the New Moon is Evil; persons falling sick on this day rarely, if ever, recover.
A child born on the Eleventh day after the New Moon will be much devoted to religion,
and of engaging form and manners.
The sickness that befalls a person on the Fifteenth day, is likely to prove fatal. This
section on Celestial affairs, that is, the Moon treats of everyday.
Disposition Of Any Person. This section teaches how you may tell whether a person has
a good or an ill nature. Whether they are generous or critical and stingy.
Physiognomy Or The Art Of Face Reading. Learn how to know your man; how to judge
a person by their face. The world is full of deceitful two-faced people, liars, -thieves, and
sneaks. It seems that many people would sooner be deceitful than’honest. Learn to know
and love honest, good people. Also learn to know the deceitful ones, those you should
not trust. Many make a grave error in judging. They know not the hypocrite from the
sincere. The Hypocrite, for instance, has not a frank look of an honest man. Tells you
about the forehead, eyes, nose, mouth, lips, ears, chin, voice laughter and everything that
is necessary for one to know regarding the real nature and disposition of those you meet
in life. Whether they are a coward, a hero, a fool, a wise man, a scoundrel or an intelli-
gentleman. Read this: A person with flat ears is stupid. A forth-pointed chin announces
gayety. A pointed nose, with thin lips, marks avarice.
A pointed nose with piercing eye, denotes a scoffing disposition.
A flat nose signifies violence and debauchery. Thick lips indicate goodness.
If you have a copy of this book you can come very close to learning what you want to
to know about any person.
Lucky Days Are Happy Days. This section shows you the lucky days for business,
marriage, requesting favors.
This Is Unlucky. Read About It: To meet a funeral as you are going to the church to
be married, betokens the death of your first child in infancy.
Now Read This: March is a fortunate month for beginning a new building; and it is
singular, but nevertheless reckoned true, that it is good to open a concert-room, a music­
shop, or begin a new piece of music on the eve of St. Cecilia. It is not good to marry on
yo*ur own birthday, or on any martyr’s; every other saint’s day is fortunate in this concern;
neither is it fortunate for a woman to marry in colours; let her dress be as white as pos­
sible, except she be a widow, then let her choose some pleasant colour, but beware of
green and yellow.
And This: To meet a white horse when you are going on any particular business is a
sign of success, and a piebald one, if you are going to ask a favour; to be followed by a
strange dog is lucky, especially to a man who is going courting.
And This: For a pigeon to fly into the house not belonging to it is a signofsickness,
and if it rests on a bed, it is death; but two pigeons is a sign of a wedding.
And This: Never pick up an odd glove in the street; it is not fortunate.
Does not do any harm to know these things. They are true and it is your duty to pay
due attention to warnings that mean danger.
Dice. There is a certain secret connected with three dice. If you know it you can find
out many things regarding a wedding, a death, a letter, tears and sighs, a new admirer,
trouble, a journey, and many other things too numerous to mention. Much is depended
upon throwing of the dice. Dominoes. Learn how to shuffle them for fortunate specula­
tion, law suits, love, thieves, swindlers, creditors, lottery tickets, etc.
Charms And Ceremonies. Listen To This, It is interesting and true. : Take a piece of
the bride’s cake and pass it three times through the wedding ring, than lay it under the
pillow upon which an unmarried woman sleeps and she will dream of her future husband.
To know what fortune your future husband will have. Yoi>are told in this book what to
do if you wish to know whether you will marry a gentleman, of riches; a clergyman, of
white linen; a lawyer, of ability; a tradesman, soldier, sailor, or a farmer, clerk or banker.
Remember, full directions for determining this is given.

de Laurence’s Oracle Of Life And Destiny, Famous Book Of Fate, shows that Dreams
have, in all nges and countries, been believed in as indications of the future. What­
ever is more mysterious than dreams? Our dreams arise out of the past and present
circumstances of our life and therefore are not altogether without connection with
our future destiny, as most other omens are. In the most ancient civilized communi*
ties of which we have any record—those of Egypt and Babylon—to interpret dreams was
one of the most important state offices. Grave philosophers wrote treatieses on the inter,
pretation of dreams, as they did on Astrology. Today many educated persons believe that
dreams (if properly interpreted) foretell events in the future.
Death Dreams Of Father
From The London Weekly Dispatch
FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT, SITTINGBORNE, SATURDAY
Two years ago, during a deadly influenza epidemic, Mr. George Bean, a fitter in Chatham
Dockyard, living at Gillingham, dreamt that he saw his daughter in her coffin. Nine days
later the girl died from pneumonia.
About nine days ago Mr. Bean dreamt that his 17-year-old son the only surviving child, ’
was lying dead in his coffin. On Thursday this son, who was learning the motor business,
started from home to motor-cycle to Canterbury. His father, having a presentiment that
evil would befall him, tried to persuade him not to go. But the boy started, and near Sit-
tingbourne collided with a cyclist, was thrown under the wheels of a traction engine, and
was killed instantly.
At the inquest to-day a verdict of Accidental Death was returned. Mr. and Mrs. Bean
regard it as destiny.
Dreams Are Of Universal Interest. Dreams always make a most visible impression on
the one having them. A person may arise in the morning despondent and deeply im­
pressed by some dream which has startled them during sound sleep. That dreams of
this kind are a premonition or forecast, of something unfortunate about to happen in one’s
life, is shown by the Newspaper Article reproduced above; under the title of “Death
Dreams Of Father.” This article appeared in the London Weekly Dispatch of Sunday,
Dec. 12, 1920.

How Talismans May Be Worn. A Talisman reproduced on Genuine Virgin Parchment
should, if you wish to preserve, and keep it a long length of time, be protected from
perspiration or dampness in wet weather. The Genuine Leather Talisman Case shown
here has been designed especially for this purpose and can be carried in the pocket and
bills as well as several Talismans kept in it secretly.
It is a Hidden Truth that only Genuine Virgin
Parchment, made from lamb skin, Is proper for
making Talismans. The old Egyptian and Hindu
Kabalists always traced their Talismans upon
Genuine Virgin Parchment, and it said, that their
Talismans were “strong and useful,” and were be­
lieved to have Wonderful power in producing cer­
tain effects. It is said, that a True Talisman will
give victory over every earthly enemy; providing it
is rightly formed on Genuine Virgin Parchment
and carried in a Leather Talisman Case.
Talismans are always reproduced in Gold Ink
on Genuine Virgin Parchment for Honor, for Man’s
Love, for Woman’s Love, for Working Bewitch­
ments and Spells, to Insure Success, Overcome Dis­
ease and Enemies, Promote Health and Success in
business and trade.

Sight. The time is fulfilled for every sin­
cere student who desires Divine Illumina­
tion and understanding of Spirit Sight and

ant, Medium or Sage. These LESSONS,
which are for private home study, will help

of every sincere soul who wishes to enter
upon the Pathway followed by every noted
Adept or illuminated soul.
The spirit searcheth all things, yea, all the
deep truths of Spiritual Illumination, Pro­
phetic Insight and Occult Mastery, as well as

The School Of Christ Continued
Mysticism Is The Science
Of The Spiritual Life Of Man
When the ears of the student are ready to hear, and his soul becomes quiet
enough to listen to the Spiritual Voice within him, then cometh to him the teachings
of Divine Wisdom. It is then, and only then, that no thing, or no mystery may remain
unsealed to him who has, by study and practice, obtained the opened spiritual eye of
the Seer and Clairvoyant.
The human soul, illuminated by Spiritual Wisdom, is like a stately Monument.
It is a tribute to Spiritual Truth and is as enduring as Eternity.
Time Rolls Ofn. Time rolls on, and no man shall set a day for Time. Only the
spirit of God within the soul knows the secret of Time and Truth. Life is one with
all Life, and God is all Life, and Life is all God.
Spiritual Truth is the only Truth for men’s souls, back over which rolls the Great
Scroll of Life’s historic past.
The foolish teachings of man show through the mist of by-gone ages that lie
between Spiritual Truth and Error. Spirit holds the Secret Of Continuous Life.
These LESSONS are to the student like a lighted torch to show him the way
through the door of the Mystic Temple.
Spiritual Illumination is a Rock Graven Emblem, as mysterious and vast an the
brooding spirit of the silent Sphinx on the River Nile in Egypt’s Mystical Light.
Neither shall they say, lo, here! or lo there! for lo! true Spirit or Inner Sight'is
within you and can only be developed by constant study of lessons by a Great Master.
Let the one who reads here, be it Saint, Sinner, Sage, Prophet, Medium, Clairvoy­
ant, or Seer, know that this is what Christ meant when He said: “Develop your inner
or Spiritual Sight.” Every soul who would attain Spiritual Illumination from THE
SCHOOL OF CHRIST, must listen to the teaching of Divine Wisdom, otherwise health
and disease, life and death, will be an impenetrable mystery.
If you are a sincere student of THE SCHOOL OF CHRIST, your daily thought
will be—i WILL FOLLOW THE MYSTICAL PATH THAT LEADS TO SPIRITUAL
DEVELOPMENT. Every true student of “The Way, The Truth And The Life” must
“follow the gleam” until the spiritual light of Eternal Wisdom illuminates his soul.
Those who fail to do this will find that “life is a supreme mystery.”
Spirit Nature, within every human soul, speaks of Immortality and the con­
tinuity of life beyond the grave.
The Way, The Truth And The Life
The Spiritual Voice Of God In The Soul Of Man
This OFFICIAL COURSE OF LESSONS by de Laurence, now published for the
first time in book form, teaches the mysteries of Spiritualism and Occultism. These
same Great Mysteries and Spiritual Truths have long been sealed and kept hidden.
Heed now the warning: “He that has eyes to see, let him see.” i
The mysterious Sphinx on the River Nile in Egypt propounds a riddle, and
devours him who cannot answer it. The riddle of the Sphinx is: Whence came I?
Where do I go? How? Why?
The Sphinx represents the fact that all life is manifested in the world of form,
rising out of matter. Mankind is eternally seeking light in the East, whence all light
comes—an eternal growth by spiritual unfoldment from within.
The Phoenix is a fabled bird said to rise rejuvenescent from its ashes after immo­
lating itself on a funeral pyre. It is emblematical of the fact that life is eternal—
that the soul of the so-called dead shall manifest itself in form again. The form dies,
but the life has no end, having had no beginning.
The master work of man is the building of true character. He who does this
has performed the Great Work. Now, character arises from obedience to the law of
the spirit.
The real Key to the great problem of Spiritual Development, Soul and Clairvoyant
Sight is given, and other important details are fully explained by de Laurence in this
wonderful course of LESSONS. Once you learn from these LESSONS, which are for
private home study, how to develop your Spiritual Nature, Psychic Powers, Occult
Powers, and your Sixth Sense, you will feel that you have Divine Illumination. You
will then know that the voice of your Spiritual Nature is speaking from within you.
You will also be able to listen to your own spiritual voice. It is this voice that speaks
to the Prophet. It tells those who have developed their Occult Powers about things
of the past, and things that will happen in the future.

This Man Is Pleased With His Diploma
de Laurence Co. Frankslake, Sask., Can., Feb. 8, 1917.
Gentlemen—Some time ago I received the Tarot Cards and the books I ordered, also de
Laurence’s beautiful Diploma, and I am well pleased. The Diploma certainly is a masterpiece
of Art. I have studied "The Great Book Of Magical Art, Hindu Magic And East Indian
Occultism" and have found that it is far superior to any book I have ever read. I would, not take
$100.00 for it if I could not get another one.
A young lady who has seen my Diploma and read some of the books has agreed to be my
partner and she would like to become one of de Laurance’s Disciples in Art Magic and a student
of Occultism. We are both very busy these days practicing Magnetic healing, Hypnotism ami
Talismanic Magic as taught in de Laurence’s books and are doing fine. I will send you an order
for some more books in the near future. With best wishes, I remain, Your student. The above
letter is on file in our office.
.v8 THE de LAURENCE COMPANY
de Laurence
Teacher, Author And Publisher
de Laurence’s works on the subject prove that the history of Spiritism recedes from view
back into the ages of Antiquity, and that Spirit Communication constitutes one long unbroken
chain stretching from the most ancient to the most modern times. This great writer also shows
that there has been no time in any age when it has ever ceased to exist and that the many
changes effected by different re­
ligions, altered opinions, and the
rise and fall of Governments and
Dynasties have never succeeded in
driving out of the soul of man the
inherent desire to communicate
with the inhabitants of the Spirit
World, and have no more succeeded
in obliterating Spirit Manifesta­
tions and Communications from the
Book of Human Destiny, than the
overshadowing gloom of midnight
drives away the fragrance and
beauty of the buds and flowers it so
effectually conceals.
Many have been impelled to ex­
press to us the enthusiastic ad­
miration which they, as a student
of Spiritualism and Occultism, feel
for de Laurence, whom they do not
think justly appreciated.
No teacher, instructor, or man
in the whole field of Spiritual or
Occult education, has shown such
masterly ability and genius flor
furthering Occult teachings, or has
grown more rapidly in favor with
the Indian, American and English
students; neither has any other
man, or teacher, given’ to the world
such Occult, Spiritual and Magical
teachings. In all his work and
teachings, this great Master has
been most unselfish and has shown
such Powers of sustained and effec­
tive Occult and Spiritual work that
he has admirably combined the en­
thusiasm .of a teacher and that of a
master. Leading Spiritualists in
the United States were a iittle dis­
posed to look askance on him at
first, but their attitude has greatly
changed, although yet we do not
think they appreciate him, as we
of India, at his full worthy de
Laurence will go down in history
as a famous Teacher, Author and
Master who marked a great and
valuable effort.
Artist’s Conception of
de Laurence Wearing A Turban
There are also many Teachers, Instructors, and Spiritualists who do not know de Laurence
Intimately, consequently their personal relations to him,may not be quite cordial, because he
has taken away large numbers of their students. However, their appreciation of his character
and his work is almost unbounded, for they realize and know that from the point of another
Teacher, Master and Author he looms up as a great figure in the field of Spiritualism and East
Indian Occultism.—The India Call, 1906.
Mystic Adept Of India And Egypt
de Laurence is, without any doubt, the greatest Master, and Adept living today. His
teachings are accepted all over the world. This great man’s books are acknowledged as
standard and official text books in all the Occult Temples of Egypt and Indin. If de Laur­
ence is not a great Adept and teacher, why have his books been translated into the French,
German, Spanish, Chinese, Swedish and Arabic? Every book written by this famous Adept
is a “Master Work” and is quickly bought up by advanced Occult students in all parts of
the world. His latest book, “The Master Key,” is now in the Thirty-First Edition.
When you read an article written by him you realize that he is without a rival. After
reading a chapter written by de Laurence the student and investigator at once concludes
that all others are ages behind him. Western spiritualists are just beginning to awaken
to the fact that they have their horse hitched tc the wrong end of their band wagon. Ten
years ago they thought they were already so wise that they did not need advice from a
great Master like de Laurence.
As a matter of fact today, de Laurence has more followers than all other teachers com­
bined, and hundreds and thousands of spiritualists are studying his books for the simple
reason that they teach the Sacred Mysteries of those very same Eastern Orders to which
all such illustrious Masters as Plato, Pythagoras, Buddha, Jesus, Guatama and ethers be­
longed. If you would become great in spiritual and occult powers, follow in the footsteps
of the old Master Adepts of the Orient. If these great souls found it necessary to go to
the Orient in order to learn from the Master Adepts before they could manifest certain spir­
itual powers, why is it not also necessary for the western spiritualists to also study these
sacred mysteries. The Three Wise Men came from the East (the Orient) and the wise stu­
dent and earnest investigator will look to the Eastern Orders and the Hindu Adepts for real
Knowledge. The other class whe want to “stall” and pretend they are mediums will never
get the real knowledge.

The Magic Torch And The Magic Candle
Thousands of strange inventions by the Arabians and Egyptians might be here described
as these people certainly had the ability of effecting most astonishing things by the medium
of the Astral Light as the Asiatic and Oriental nations have a faculty of producing similar
effects by similar Rites, Invocations, and Ominous Inscriptions. In the simple operation of
nature, many wonderful and strange things are wrought by the Adepts, which, upon a super­
ficial view, appear impossible or supernatural, thus: It has been recently discovered by the
Initiates of Occultism, that Lamps or Torches, composed of certain ingredients, have a won­
derful effect upon one’s Clairvoyant Vision, such as the composition of The Magic Torch
and The Magic Candle.
It is not to be wondered at that natural things being fitted to the Times and Constella­
tions, compounded by Sympathetic Ingredients, should produce strange and apparently
supernatural effects. Since the Occult causes are appropriate to the effect, a few of these
we will here mention; and first, of the composition of The Magical Candle.
"This candle is spoken of by a very learned philosopher of the last century. It is care­
fully compounded by the Adepts, after the following manner: They take a good quantity of
the venal blood lukewarm, as it comes out of the vein, which, being chemically prepared with
alcohol and other ingredients, is at last made up into a candle, which, being at once kindled,
never is extinguished till the death of the party from whose blood it is componuded of; for,
when he is sick or in danger, it burns dim and troubled, and when he is dead, it is quite
extinguished.”—Ancient HIS.

de Laurence’s New Edition
On Sale At Only $5.50 Is Better
Than The London Edition For $75.00
On the first page there Is shown The de Laurence 1932 American Edition of “THE
BOOK OF THE SACRED MAGIC OF ABRA-MELIN THE MAGE,” which is an exact repro­
duction of the 1883 London Edition of this famous book.
Of late there has been such a large demand for this valuable book that dealers in
rare books have b6en charging a high price for it, because the London Edition, which is
long out of print, has become so rare and scarce.
In order to supply the demand at a low price, de Laurence was compelled to pay $75.00
and import the only perfect used copy to be found in Europe before he could proceed
with the publication of an American Edition which is now on sale at only $5.50.
After de Laurence paid $75.00 to a dealer in rare books in London, he proceeded to
publish, at great, expense, an American Edition of this marvelous book, de Laurence’s
1932 American Edition is absolutely guaranteed to be an exact reproduction of the 1883
London Edition; word for word, and page for page.
As stated, before de Laurence could obtain a perfect copy of this rare book he was
compelled to pay $75.00 for it in London. However, thanks to de Laurence, who always
does what he can to help students of Occultism, the American Edition is now on sale at
only $5.50, Prepaid.
A notable difference between the 1883 London Edition, and de Laurence’s 1932 Amer­
ican Edition is that the latter is superior in every way. The binding on the de Laurence
Edition is the finest, and is stamped in Genuine Oriental Gold. Has Gold Edges. It is
printed on the finest paper, and the workmanship throughout is first class.

THE FAMOUS BOOK
OF THE SACRED MAGIC OF
ABRA-MELIN THE MAGE
AS DELIVERED IN THE YEAR 1458, A. D.
BY THAT GREAT ADEPT IN MAGIC
ABRAHAM THE JEW UNTO HIS SON LAMECH
Translated From The Original Hebrew Into
The French And Now Rendered From The Latter
Language Into English. From A Valuable And Rare
Old MS. In The “Bibliotheque de I’Arsenal” At Paris
By S. L. MAC GREGOR-MATHERS
AUTHOR OF “THE KABBALAH UNVEILED,” “THE TAROT,”
Magic of the Fifteenth Century
Abraham the Jew, who discovered the Light of Initiated Wisdom, and who 1» the
author of “THE SACRED MAGIC OF ABRA-MELIN THE MAGE” described herein, was
born -571 years ago, and was the contemporary of both Nicolas Flamel and Pernelle, and
also of the mystical Christian Rosenkreutz, the founder of the celebrated Rosicrucian
Order or Fraternity in Europe.
Keys Of the Great Work Found In The
Hieroglyphical Book of Abraham The Jew
The author of this rare old manuscript was a descendant of that Abraham the Jew
who wrote the celebrated Alchemical Work of twenty-one pages on bark or papyrus, which
came into the hands of Nicolas Flamel. We take this occasion to relate that Nicolas
Flamel belongs to Alchemy exclusively, and he. enters into our consideration only because
of the Hieroglyphical Book of Abraham the Jew, in which were found the absolute Keys
of the Great Work, and by whose study Flamel is said eventually to have attained the
possession of the “Stone Of the Wise.”
Popular tradition affirms that Flamel did not die, and that he buried a treasure under
the tower of Saint Jacques de la Boucherie. According to illuminated Adepts, this treas­
ure, contained in a cedar box covered with plates of the seven metals, was the original
copy of the famous Manuscript attributed to Abraham the Jew, with commentaries in
writing of Flamel, and specimens of the Powder of Projection for the transmutation of
certain metals into gold.
The only remains of the Church of Saint Jacques de la Boucherie which exists a't the
present day, is the tower; which stands near the Place du Chatelet, about ten minutes’
walk from the Bibliotheque de 1’Arsenal; and there is yet a street near this tower which
bears the title of “Rue Nicolas Flamel,” so that his memory still survives in Paris, to_
gether with that of the Church close to which he lived, and to which, after the attainment
of the Philosopher’s stone, he and his wife Pernelle caused a handsome peristyle to be
erected.
Rare Occult Manuscript Divided Into
Three Books Each With Its Separate Title Page
The First Book Of The HOLY MAGIC contains Twelve Chapters which give plain
Advice and an Autobiography; both addressed by this great Adept to his son.
The Second Book of the HOLY MAGIC contains Twenty Chapters giving instruction
and telling very plainly how to obtain the Magical Powers desired.
The Third Book of the HOLY MAGIC contains Thirty Chapters showing how to apply
these Magical and Occult Powers to produce an immense number of Magical results.
The author claims, and shows, that he himself, personally, has actually been able to
obtain the wonderful effects desired in the Third Book of the HOLY MAGIC, and man?
others besides.

MANUSCRIPT CONCEALED OVER 400 YEARS
Abraham had himself received “THE BOOK OF THE SACRED MAGIC OF ABRA-
MELIN THE MAGE,’’ which was written in the original Hebrew, from Abra-Melin. The
old book was later translated from the Hebrew into the French. The French translation
was concealed from the curious and after four hundred years was discovered among a lot
of valuable old Manuscripts in “The Library Of The Arsenal” at Paris, France. It was
t -anslated into English by S. L. MacGregor-Mathers and published in London in the year
1 ;83. The London Edition had become so scarce and rare that it was almost impossible to
ootain a copy at any price. Indeed, there are very few copies of this famous rare old book
in existence outside of possibly one or two in private libraries. It cannot be obtained even
from the British Museum whose enormous collections of rare old Manuscripts and rare
Occult books have been thoroughly searched. Neither have we ever heard by traditional
report of the existence of a single copy of this old book throughout the Orient and the Far
East; not even in the Temples and Lamaseries of the Venerable Old Adepts.
Before de Laurence paid the great cost of publishing an American Edition of the
1883 London Edition, it, as stated above, had long been out of print, and it had become
almost impossible to obtain a copy of this famous book at any price. We understand th s
work became so rare and scarce that there were few copies to be had even at the high
price of $75.00, and it is reported that $100.00 has been asked for a second-hand copy.
A dealer in rare old books on Occultism, in London, as shown by one of the letters
reproduced in this circular, is asking $75.00 for an old copy of this marvelous book. There
ax*e only one or two copies to be obtained even at that price. Since writing the above, we
have heard that a copy of this famous old book is said to exist in Holland, and the price
asked for it is $250.00.
By reproducing, at great expense, an American edition of this old book, we feel that
we are conferring a real benefit upon students of Occultism over the world by placing
within their reach, for the first time, this marvelous book which is of great importance
from an Occult and Spiritual standpoint.
Eight Thousand Old Manuscripts, Seven Hundred Thousand
Printed Books In The Library Of The Arsenal At Paris, France
Very few English or American visitors to Paris know of the famous “Library of the
Arsenal.” It was founded as a private collection by Antoine Rene Voyer D’Argenson,
Marquis de Paulny; and was first opened to the public on the 28th day of April, 1797, over
a century ago. This Library is said to contain one of the richest private collections known.
In round numbers it now possesses 700,000 printed books, and about 8000 old Manuscripts,
many of them being of immense value. Among these old and valuable Manuscripts was
»-liscovered, as stated, the French translation, from which this “BOOK OF THE SACRED
MAGIC OF ABRA-MELIN” was translated into English, and which is now offered for the
first time at a low price.
The London Price For A Perfect
Used Copy Of This Rare Book Is $75.00

For The Student of Cabalistic Occultism And Magic
Concerning this extraordinary set of books, Dr. de Laurence is quoted
as saying that it is the most valuable in print today for the student. No
medium, spiritualist or student of the occult should be without them. Para­
celsus made discoveries during his lifetime which are now being used in the
great temples of the occult throughout the Orient. Indeed, it is common
knowledge that many of the Hindu Adepts and old, venerable masters of the
Far East, even today, are found sitting quietly in their cabinets studying these
two massive volumes, which contain the wonderful mysteries of the occult,
secrets and discoveries that Paracelsus made during his lifetime.

THE WRITINGS OF PARACELSUS,
Continued
Paracelsus’ Early Studies
Paracelsus, the author of this great work, who Dr. de Laurence commends
so highly in the preceding quotation, lived in the 16th Century. In his early
youth he obtained instructions in science from his father who taught him the
rudiments of alchemy, surgery and medicine. Paracelsus always honored the
memory of his father and always spoke in the kindest terms of him who was
not only his father but also his friend and instructor. He afterwards continued
his studies under the tuition of the monks of the monastery of St. Andrew —
situated in the valley of Savon — under the guidance of the learned Bishops
Eberhardt Baumgartner, Mathias Scheydt of Rottgach and Mathias Schacht
of Freisingen. Having attained his sixteenth year, he was sent to study at
the University of Basel. He was afterwards instructed by the celebrated
Johann Trithemius of Spanheirn, abbot of St. Jacob at Wurzburg (1451-1516),
one of the greatest adepts of occultism, magic, alchemy and astrology, and it
was under this teacher that his talents for the study of occultism were espe­
cially cultivated and brought into practical use.
Loved Occult Science
His love for the occult sciences led him to enter the laboratory of the rich
Sigismund Fugger at Schwatz in Tyrol, who, like the abbot, was a celebrated
alchemist and mystic, and able to teach his disciple many a valuable secret.
Later on, Paracelsus traveled a great deal. He visited Germany, Italy, France,
the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Russia. He even went to India be­
cause he was taken prisoner by the Tartars and brought to the Khan whose
son he afterwards accompanied to Constantinople. Every reader of the works
of Paracelsus who is also acquainted with the recent revelations made by the
Eastern Adepts cannot fail to notice the similarity of the two systems which
in many respects are almost identical.
Delves Into The Secrets Of The East
During his capitivity in Tartary, he was instructed in the secret doctrine
by the teachers of occultism in Northern India. The information given by
Paracelsus in regard to the sevenfold principles of man, the qualities of the
Astral Body, the earth-bound elementaries, etc., was then entirely unknown
in the west; but this information is almost the same as that given in “Isis
Unveiled,” “Esoteric Buddhism” and other books recently published and de­
clared to have been given by some eastern adepts and Buddhist priests. Para­
celsus, moreover, wrote a great deal about the Elements, or spirits of nature,
but in his description of them he substituted for the eastern terms such as
were more in harmony with the German mythological conceptions, for the pur­
pose of bringing these subjects more to the understanding of his countrymen
who were used to the western method of thought.
Received The Philosopher’s Stone
It is probable that Paracelsus stayed among the Tartars between 1512
and 1521 because, according to Van Helmont’s account, he came to Constan­
tinople during the latter year and there received the Philosopher’s Stone. The
Adept from whom Paracelsus received this stone was, according to a certain
aurernn vellus (Printed at Rorschach in 1859), a certain Solomon Trismosinus
or (Pfeiffer), a countryman of Paracelsus. It is said that this Trismosinus was
also in possession of the Universal Panacea; and it is asserted that he had been
seen, still alive, by a French traveler, at the end of the seventeenth Century.

The Secrets Of All Races
Paracelsus traveled through the countries along the Danube to Italy where
he served as an army surgeon in the Imperial Army. He participated in many
of the warlike expeditions of these times, and on these occasions he collected
a great deal of useful information, not only from physicians, surgeons and
alchemists, but also from his intercourse with executioners, barbers, shepherds,
Jews, gypsies, midwives and fortune-tellers. Thus he collected the wisdom of
the high and the low, the learned and unlearned.
Worldly Wealth
Paracelsus was never a seeker after wealth or material gain, and he left
very few wordly goods at the time of his death. However, the bequest to
humanity which he left in the shape of his authentic manuscripts contained in
the two large volumes offered here is rich and imperishable. This extraordi­
nary man—one of the most remarkable of all time— was genius enough to
say that “Faith is a luminous star that leads the honest seeker into the deeper
mysteries of nature and self.”
A Gold Mine For The Student
Any student of the Occult who peruses these books will surely find the
richest of treasures buried at the places that Paracelsus has pointed out with
his magic wand. This set contains within its handsome covers inexhaustible
mines of occult and mystic knowledge, and gems of great wealth and wisdom
may be found by the diligent investigator—gems signifying a great deal that
is at present misunderstood and rejected and await the investigator to be
brought to light and cut into some of the most valuable ornaments of the
temple of truth and wisdom. Let no one question the value of these books.
These books and writings are supported by “revelation” — they were revealed
mystically to the inner consciousness of the author.
A Great Teacher
Perhaps the greatest and most illuminated soul of the sixteenth century
was Paracelsus, the seer, the adept, who sought out the laws of mysterious
occult and spiritual forces and astral powers which, then as today obscured
by the mists and vapors of dogmatic theology and gross superstitious ignor­
ance. Lest the reader forget, it is repeated here, that he can do no better than
to follow the teachings and doctrines of the great adepts of light who pos­
sessed the astral power to see. These men have been the great reformers of
all ages, from Confucius and Zoroaster down to Jacob Boehme, Agrippa and
Eliphas Levi. Their teachings have been verified by their disciples and those
whose inner light permitted them to see and understand the things of the
spirit and astral worlds.
Moral And Scientific
Morals and ethics are part of their doctrines; scientific subjects and seer­
ship another. These are pages in the book of universal wisdom and contain
an understanding which renders one both learned and illuminated. Do not
confound these great teachings with the foolish claims of fraudulent modern
writers. Become a disciple and sincere student of the Masters and develop
that power of spiritual perception potentially contained in every man and
woman. Do not separate learning from wisdom, for logic will not light your
way. Become wise by learning the secrets which were revealed only to the
initiated in the inner temple where the ancient mysteries were taught. History
and observation show that among those who taught the moral aspect of these
secret doctrines none was greater than Buddha of India, Plato and Jesus of
Nazareth, Continued On Next Page

The Way Of The World
During his later days, Paracel­
sus was beset by the envy and hate
of the “recognized authoritiesfor
many of his time were too ignorant
to appreciate the great master. At
last he was treacherously killed by
his enemies, just as was Jesus of
Nazareth. After his death many of
Paracelsus’ enemies regretted their
indiscretion and expressed great
veneration for him. Ignorance, cler­
ical fanaticism, superstition, dog­
matic theology, bigotry and the
mental torpitude of so-called author­
ities have in the past thrown the
dark shadows of death around the
holy head of some of the world’s
greatest men.
The Day Of Freedom And Light
Let us hope, however, that the day is near when we can shake off entirely
the incubus of intolerance and ignorance and breathe in freely again the
atmosphere of wisdom and truth. True, the mortal bodies of Jesus and Paracel­
sus have returned to the elements from whence they sprang, but their wisdom,
teachings, ethics and genius still live. And, as the minds of men and women
become better suited to an understanding of spiritual and philosophical truths,
these great souls appear before them like a golden sun on the mental and
spiritual horizon, a sun whose light, by the laws of destiny and fate, is des­
tined to illuminate the world of men and to penetrate deep into the heart of
all the race. It will warm and thaw the souls of men from whom the occult
science and spiritual power of the future will spring.

De Laurence Edition. Size 7y2 by 10% inches.
200 Illustrations. 297 Pages. Cloth, Gold Stamp.
Privately Printed By L. W. de Laurence.
Includes All The Rites And Mysteries Of Goeti<s
Theurgy, Sorcery, Witchcraft, Black Art, Be­
witchments, Evocations, Spells, Infernal Nec­
romancy And The Rituals Of True Black Magic.
Every student of the Deeper Phases of Oc­
cultism, and most especially Sorcery and Infer­
nal Necromancy understands that the Ritual
Of Black Magic And Of Pacts has a Talismanic
force compelling the Higher Powers and
Spirits of the Astral Plane to grant them fa­
vors even against their own will.
The Ritual of Black Magic, as well as the Ritual ot
Sorcery, is fully and most thoroughly taught in this un­
usual book, which has never been sold publicly, the
very same having been privately printed by <te 'Lau­
rence, and sold for $15.00 a copy.
To the student of Higher Spiritism and Ancient Occultism, which was venerable With
age before the time of the Pyramids on the River Nile, and whose History is lost in the nig'&t
of time, the Solemn Ritual of Black Magic, with its terrible mysteries, always took a certain
prescribed form for Invocations and Ceremonies.
Extraordinary facts are known by those who have learned from “THE BOOK OF BLACK
MAGIC AND OF FACTS.” Within the covers of this Book are to be found the Keys of the
‘Apocalypse and of 2Ezekiel, as well as the Magical Clavicles or The Greater Key of Solomon.*
Many believe this book to be more extraordinary and of greater importance than the
Kabbalistic Keys.
A very distinguished Adept in the Rituals of Black Magic has revealed, not the Secrets
and Mysteries, which are taught in this Book, but its antiquity and the singular preservation
of the monumental and extraordinary terrific secret sciences of which few men know.
The Teaching within this Book, however, is strong and simple as the Architecture of the
pyramids, and consequently as enduring. This Book is indeed a sum of the Mysteries and’
Secrets of all of the Rites and Rituals Of Black Magic And Of Pacts. With it the Adept,
Initiate and Occult Student can resolve many a mystery and problem. Its invoking is
inspiring; for it is a Masterpiece, and most assuredly one of the finest Books of its kind
bequeathed to v 3 by antiquity. It contains an Universal Key.
Let it be here noted, and understood, that once this Science is thoroughly demonstrated,
it will be of no second-grade importance. Its serious study leads earnest minds to act
powerfully and intelligently—the sum of all the knowledge of Magic.

Once men cease to understand the things taught in this Book, they are at a standstill
as far as the real knowledge of Black Magic is concerned. This Book gives you the Word
so that once you understand its secrets you can enter into the domain of enigma and
mystery.
Many people have, in the past, ignored the Teachings of Black Magic and of Pacts, and
they have perished. KNOWLEDGE IS POWER. LEARN AND BE WISE. UNDERSTAND
AND BE POWERFUL.
Ceremonial Magic Of The Middle Ages. This work deals in an exhaustive manner with
all of the Magic Rituals extant today. It shows that there is a Magic which is behind Magic,
and that great Occult teachers as well as the Occult Sanctuaries possess their Secrets and
Mysteries. Contains an analytical and critical account of all Great Magical Rituals known.
Part Two forms a complete Grimoire Of Black Magic. Explains Mysteries by the light from
the Lamp of the Sanctuaries. Deals with Phantom Vampires, Spells and the Mysteries of
Black Science.
The Wonder-World Of Mysticism, Magic And Sorcery. To understand Black and Cere­
monial Magic, is to quickly pass over the royal road into the depth and understanding of
all Mystery; for therein lies the Wonder-World of Mysticism, Magic, and Sorcery. Therein
the visible melts into the unseen, the Invisible is manifested openly, motion from place to
place is accomplished without traversing the intervening distance, matter passes through
matter. To understand the deep Mysteries of Magic, is to know that in two straight lines
may enclose a space; space has a fourth dimension, and further possibilities beyond it;
without metaphor and without evasion, the circle is mathematically squared.
There Life Is Prolonged, Youth Renewed, Physical Immortality Secured. There Earth
becomes Gold and Gold Earth. There Words and Wishes possess Creative Power, desire
relaizes its object. There, also the dead live, and the Hierarchies of Extra-mundane intel­
ligence are within easy communication, and become Ministers or Tormentors, Guides or
Destroyers, of man. There the Law of Continuity is suspended by the interference of the
Higher Law of Fantasia.
No man should ignore either the Teachings of Occultism nor the Mysteries of Magic,
either Black or White. Indeed, it is as important for one to understand White and Black
Magic as it is to be learned in the Mysteries of Obsession, Black Magic and Witchcraft.
It should be remembered that the wise man is not allured by the Allegories of ’Poly­
theism. The unlearned are very unfortunate indeed. It should be remembered, and never
forgotten, that Christ, the Mysterious Founder of Christianity, True Spiritism and Occultism,
which is now venerable with age, was saluted in his cradle by the Three Magi—that is to
say, that the Three Wise Men came from the East, and not from Jerusalem. They were the
Ambassadors of the Three parts of the known World, as well as Analogical Worlds of
Occult Phylosophy. It was in the School of Alexandria, with its magnificent Symbols and
its gracious Images, that one was illuminated and became an Initiate of the Rituals Of
Black Magic And Of Pacts, as well as the Ceremonies and Rites of White Magic.
Many, today, are sufficiently wrong-headed, and so ignorant of matters of this kind,
that they may not be surprised if misfortune, evil and ill-luck crosses their path. Life to a
man of this kind is like a troubled wilderness trying to rest after a storm; but there is no
rest; for unseen Influences and Evil Spirits are heard to whisper strange Oracles as they
pass.
Salt is a Symbol of Wisdom and Immortality. Many talk without knowledge; for few
there are, who have ever been Initiated into the Secret Mysteries taught in this really
wonderful book.
To know the sanctuary of Antique Initiation is to partake of the fruits of the tree Of
Occult Knowledge. To discover the absolute Doctrine. To know how to operate both Good
and Evil. To learn how to protect yourself against Evil Spirits, Obsession, Witchcraft,
Voodooism, and Voudou. The latter being of African origin.
The Ancients carried their secrets with them to their Tomb; for they were the real
Initiates of the Secret Science of which many, even today, are afraid of. They were
acquainted with things of which others knew nothing. This Book teaches that hidden
something which all men desire to know. Once you own this Fine Book and study it, you
will become invested with a dread and an unknown power. This Book reveals all.
There existed in the past, and there exists in the present, a potent and real Magic, and
all that legends have said of it is true. There is, indeed, a formidable secret, the revela­
tion of which has once already transformed the world, as testified in Egyptian religious
tradition. Symbolically summarized by Moses at the beginning of Genesis. Moses’ depicts it
under a figure of a tree which is in the center of the Terrestrial Paradise, is in proximity
to the tree of life and has a radical connection therewith; at the foot of this tree is the
source of the four mysterious rivers; it is guarded by the sword of fire and by the four
figures of the Biblical Sphinx, the Cherubim of Ezekiel. . . . Here I must pause, and I fear
already that I have said too much. Yes, there is one sole, universal, and imperishable
dogma, strong as the supreme reason; simple, like all that is great; intelligible, like all
that is universally and absolutely true; and this dogma has been the parent of all others.
Know both White and Black Magic. Learn their Rituals. This counsel should be
impressed on everyone who wishes to approach this wonderful science.
Reason, Truth And Justice
The man who believes in his own opinions and is afraid to part with them; who is
skeptical of new truths, should never own a copy of this rare book. If any man be held by
anything- in the world more than by reason, truth, and justice; if he will be uncertain and
vacillating, either in good or evil; if logic alarms him, or the naked truth makes him shrink;
if he is hurt when accepted errors are assailed; let him pay no attention to this marvelous
book. He should not read it; let it cease to exist for him; but at the same time he must not
cry it down as_ dangerous. The secrets within it will be easily understood by the few. A
book of this kind will not be held back by those who understand it.
Shew light to the birds of the night-time and you hide their light; it is the light which
blinds them, and for them is more dark than the darkness. The author of this book, which
has always been privately printed and sold by de Laurence, speaks clearly and makes
known everything, with the firm conviction that the serious student, or those who deserve
to know these things will read all and understand all.
Man may become king of the hidden forces of Nature by subduing and controlling
them; otherwise he will be their victim and will suffer much by the instinctive and evil

forces of the Astral Plane. Life is a field of battle where liberty struggles with inertia by
the opposition of active force. This is a Material age, and the one whose eye reads here
must realize that the Ancients really possessed Secret Occult Powers that were, to say the
least, marvelous and really wonderful, and it is only by studying books of this kind that
one can learn of these secret and powerful forces.
There are many who are unable to define Magic, either Black or White. Magic is the
traditional science of the secrets of Nature, which has been handed down to us through
by-gone ages. In ancient times it was taught only from mouth to ear. If ever written, it
was expressed allegorically. By means of the secret science of Magic, either White or
Black, the Adepts become invested with a power, so that they could operate superhumanly
—that is, after a manner which transcends the normal possibility of men. Thereby many
celebrated ‘hierophants, such as Mercurius Trismegistus, Osiris, Orpheus, “Apolonius of
Tyana, and others whom it might be dangerous or unwise to name, came after their death
to be adored and invoked as gods.
To the Magi and the Adept, Knowledge is Power. Only too well do they know that
there are four indispensable conditions. Those who. are interested and wish to know may
read the following.
An Intelligence illuminated by study, an intrepidity which nothing can check, an
indomitable will which nothing can break, and a discretion which nothing can corrupt, and
nothing pervert. TO KNOW, TO DARE, TO WILL, TO KEEP SLIENCE—these are the
FOUR LAWS of the Adept. They are inscribed upon the four Symbolical forms of the
Sphinx,
Only The Learned Can Seek Initiation
You, therefore, who seek initiation, are you learned as 8Faust? Are you insensible as
Job? No, is it not so? But you may become equal to both if you will. Have you overcome
the vortices of vague thoughts? Are you without indecision or capriciousness? Do you
consent to pleasure only when you will, and do you wish for it only when you should? No,
is it not so? Not invariably at least, but it may become so if you choose. The sphinx has
not only a man’s head, it has a woman’s breasts; do you know how to resist feminine
charms? No, is it not so? And you laught outright in replying, vaunting your moral
weakness for the glorification of your physical and vital force. Be it so; I allow you to
render this homage to the ass of 7Stern or 8Apuleius. The ass has its merit, I agree; it
was consecrated to 9Priapus as was the goat to the god of Mendes. But take it for what
it is worth, and decide whether ass or man shall be master. He alone can possess truly
the pleasure of love who has conquered the love of pleasure. To be able and to forbear is
to be twice able. Woman enchains you by your desires; master your desires and you will
enchain her. The greatest injury that can be inflicted on a man is to call him a coward.
Now, what is a cowardly person? One who neglects his moral dignity in order to obey
blindly the instincts of nature. As a fact, in the presence of danger it is natural to be
afraid and seek flight: why, then, is it shameful? Because honor has erected it into a
law that we must prefer our duty to our inclinations or fears. What is honor from this
point of view? It is universal presentience of immortality and appreciation of the means
which can lead to it. The last trophy which man can win from death is to triumph over
the appetite for life, not by despair, but by a more exalted hope, which is contained in
faith; for all that is noble and honest, by the undivided consent of the world. To learn
self-conquest is therefore to learn life, and the “austerities of stoicism were no vain
parade of freedom. To yield to the forces of nature is to follow the stream of collective
life, and to be the slave of secondary causes. To resist and subdue nature is to make
one’s self a personal and imperishable life; it is to break free from the vicissitudes of life
and death. Every man who is prepared to die rather than renounce truth and justice is
most truly living, for immortality abides in his soul. To find or to form such men was the
end of all ancient initiations. “Pythagoras disciplined his pupils by silence and all kinds
of self-denial; candidates in Egypt were tried by the four elements; and we know the self-
inflicted austerities of the adepts in India for attaining the kingdom of free will and
divine independence. All “macerations of asceticism are borrowed from the initiations of
Ancient Mysteries.
In the Hieroglyphic work of 13 Hermes the Tarot, called also the Book of “Thoth, the
duad is represented either by the horns of Isis, having her head veiled and an open book
partially concealed under her mantle, or otherwise by a sovereign lady, Juno, the Greek
goodess, having one hand uplifted towards heaven and the other pointed to earth, as if
formulating by this gesture the one and twofold dogma which is the foundation of Magic,
and begins the marvellous symbols of the Emerald Table of Hermes.
In the Apocalypse of St. John there is a reference to two witnesses or martyrs on whom
prophetic tradition confers the names of Elias and Enoch—Elias, man of faith, enthusiasm,
miracle; Enoch one with him who is called Hermes by the Egyptians, honored by the
Phoenicians as “Cadmus, author of the Sacred Alphabet, and the Universal Key to the
Initiations of the Logos, father of th.e “Kabbalah, he who, according to the Sacred Alle­
gories did not die like other men, but was transported to heaven, to return at the end of
time. Much the same statement is made of St. John himself, who recovered and explained
in his Apocalypse the Symbolism of the word of Enoch. This resurrection of St. John and
Enoch, expected at the close of the ages of ignorance, will be the restitution of their doc­
trine by the comprehension of the Kabbalistic Keys which unlock the Temple of Unity
Universal Philosophy, too long occult, and reserved solely for the elect, who perish at the
hands of the world.

Our Thoughts Reflected In The Astral Light
A thought realizes itself in becoming speech; it realizes itself also by signs, sounds,
and representations of signs; this is the first degree of realization. Then it is imprinted on
the astral light by means of the signs of writing or speech; it influences other minds by
reflection upon them; it is refracted by crossing the 17diaphane of other men; it assumes
new forms and proportions; it is then translated into acts and modifies the world; this is
the last degree of realization.
The Astral light, depicted in Ancient Symbols by the Serpent devouring his tail,
represents alternately Malice and Prudence, Time and Eternity, Tempter and Redeemer;
for this light, being the vehicle of life, is an auxiliary alike of good and evil, and may be
taken for the fiery form of Satan as for the body of the Holy Ghost. It is the instrument
of warfare in angelic battles, and indifferently feeds the flames of hell and the lightnings
of St. Michael. It may be compared to a horse having a nature analogous to the chame­
leon, and ever reflecting the armour of his rider. The Astral Light is the realization or
form of the intellectual light, as the latter is the realization or form of the divine light.
Jesus, the great initiator of Christianity divining that the Astral Light was over­
charged with the impure reflections of Roman debauchery, sought to separate his Disciples
from the ambient sphere of reflections, and to make them attentive only to the interior
light, so that, through the medium of a common faith and enthusiasm, they might com­
municate together by new magnetic chains, which he termed grace, and thus overcome
the dissolute currents, to which he gave the names of the devil and Satan, signifying
their putrefaction. To oppose current to current is to renew the power of fluidic life.
The revealers have, therefore, scarcely done more than divine by the accuracy of their
calculations, the appropriate moment for moral reactions. The law of realization pro­
duces what we call magnetic breathing; places and objects become impregnated there­
with, and this communicates to them an influence in conformity with our dominant de­
sires, with those, above all, which are confirmed and realized by acts. As a. fact, the
universal agent, or latent Astral Light, ever seeks equilibrium; it fills the void and ab­
sorbs the plentitude, which makes vice contagious, like certain physical maladies, and
works powerfully in the proselytism of virtue. Hence it is that cohabitation with anti­
pathetic beings is a torment; hence it is that relics, whether of saints, or of great crim­
inals, produce the extraordinary results of sudden conversion and perversion; hence it is
that sexual love is often awakened by a breath or a touch, and this, not only by means
of the contact of the person himself, but of objects which he has unconsciously touched
or magnetized.
There is an outbreathing and inbreathing of the soul, exactly like that of the body.
It breathes in with felicity that which it believes, and it breathes forth ideas which
result from its inner sensations. Diseased souls have an evil breath, and vitiate their
moral atmosphere—-that is, they combine impure reflections with the Astral Light which
permeates them, and establish unwholesome currents therein. We are often invaded, to
our astonishment, in society by evil thoughts which would have seemed impossible, and
we are not aware that they are due to some morbid proximity. This secret is of high
importance, for it leads to the opening of consciences, one of the most incontestible and
terrible powers of Magical Art. Magnetic respiration produces about the soul a radiation
of which it is the centre, and surrounds it with the reflection of its works, creating for it
a Heaven or a hell. There are no isolated acts, and it is impossible that there should be
secret acts; whatsoever we truly will—that is, everything which we confirm by our acts
—remains registered in the Astral Light, where our reflections are preserved. These
reflections continually influence our thought by the meditation of the diaphane, and it is
in this sense that we become and remain the children of our works.
The Astral Light, transformed at the moment of conception into human light, is the
soul’s first envelope, and, in combination with extremely subtle fluids, it forms the
Ethereal body or Sidereal Phantom, of which Paracelsus discourses in his philosophy of
intuition—philosophia sagax. This Sidereal body, setting itself free at death, attracts,
and for a long time preserves, through the sympathy of things homogeneous, the reflec­
tions of the past life; if drawn along a special current by a will which is powerfully sym­
pathetic, it manifests naturally, for there is nothing more natural than prodigies. It is
thus apparations are produced. This fluidic body, subject, like the mass of the Astral
Light, to two contrary movements, attracting on the left and repelling on the right, or
reciprocally, between the two sexes, begets various impulses within us and contributes
to solicitudes of conscience; it is frequently influenced by reflections of other minds, and
thus are produced, on the one hand, temptations, and, on the other, profound and unex­
pected graces. This is also the explanation of the traditional doctrine of two angels who
strengthen and tempt us. The two forces of the Astral Light may be represented by a
balance wherein are weighed our good intentions for the triumph of justice and emanci­
pation of our liberty.
The Astral Body is not always of the same sex as the terrestrial, that is, the propor­
tions of the two forces, varying- from right to left, frequently seem to gainsay the visible
organization, producing the seeming vagaries of human passions, and explaining, without
in any sense morally justifying the amorous peculiarities of “Anacreon of “Sappho. A
skillful magnetizer should take all these subtle distinctions into account.
There are two kinds of realizations, the true and the fantastic. The first is the exclu­
sive secret of Magicians, the other belongs to Enchanters and Sorcerers. Mythologies are
fantastic realizations of religious dogma; superstitions are the sorcery of mistaken piety;
but even mythologies and superstitions are more efficacious with human will than a purely
speculative philosophy apart from any practice. Hence St. Paul opposes the conquests of
the folly of the Cross to the inertness of human wisdom. Religion realizes the philosophy
of adapting it to the weaknesses of the vulgar; such is for Kabbalists, the secret reason
and Occult explanation of the doctrines of Incarnation and Redemption.
Thoughts untranslated into speech are thoughts lost for humanity; words uncon­
firmed by acts are idle words, and the idle word is not far removed from falsehood-.
Thought formulated by speech and confirmed by acts constitutes a good work or a crime.
Hence, whether in vice or virtue, there is no speech for which we are not responsible;
above all, there are no indifferent acts. Curses and blessings invariably produce their
consequences, and every action, whatsoever its nature, whether inspired by love or hate,
has effects analogous to its motive, its extent, and its direction. When a statesman
whose images had been, mutilated, raising his hand to his face, exclaims, “I do not feel
that I am injured,” he is mistaken in his valuation and thereby detracts from the merit

of his clemency. What man of honor could behold undisturbed an Insult offered to his
portrait? And did such insults, inflicted, even unknown to ourselves, react on us by a
fatal influence, were the effects of bewitchment actual, as indeed an Adept cannot doubt,
how much more imprudent and ill-advised would seem this utterance of the good states­
man.
Terrible Visitation Of Nadab
There are persons whom we can never offend with impunity, and if the injury we
have done them is mortal, we forthwith begin to die. There are those whom we never
meet in vain, whose mere glance alters the direction of our life. The 20 basilisk who slays
by a look is no fable; it is a magical Allegory. Generally speaking, it is bad for health to
have enemies, and we can never brave with impunity the reprobation of anyone. Before
opposing ourselves to a given Astral force or current, we must be well assured that we
possess the contrary force, or are with the stream of the contrary current; otherwise, we
shall be crushed or struck down, and many sudden deaths have no other cause than this.
The terrible visitations of “Nadaband “Abiu, of2!O. S. A., of 24Ananias and Sapphira, were
occasioned by electric currents of outraged convictions; the sufferings of the 25Ursulines of
London, of the nuns of Louviers, and of the convulsionaries of “Jansenism, were identical
in principle, and are explicated by the same occult natural laws. Had not Urban Grandier
been immolated, one of two things would have occurred—either the possessed nuns would
have died in frightful convulsions, or the phenomena of diabolical frenzy would have so
gained in strength and in influence, epidemically that Grandier, notwithstanding his
knowledge and his reason, would himself have become hallucinated and to such a degree
that he would have slandered himself, like the unhappy Gaufride, or would otherwise have
perished suddenly, with all the appalling characteristics of poisoning or of divine venge­
ance. In the eighteenth century the unfortunate poet “Gilbert fell a victim to his audacity
in braving the current of opinion and actual philosophical fanaticism which characterized
his epoch. Guilty of philosophical treason, ■ he died raving mad, possessed by the most
incredible terrors, as if God himself had punished him for defending his cause out of sea­
son. As a fact, he perished by reason of a law of nature of which he could know nothing;
he set himself against an electric current, and was struck down as by lightning. Had
Marat not been assassinated by “Charlotte Corday, he would have been destroyed infallibly
by a reaction of public opinion. It was the execration of the honest which afflicted him
with leprosy, and he would have had to succumb thereto. The reprobation excited by the
massacre of St. Bartholomew was the sole cause of the atrocious disease and death of
Charles IX, while, had not Henry IV been sustained by an immense popularity, which he
owed to the projecting power or sympathetic force of his astral life, he would scarcely
have outlived his conversion, but would have perished under the contempt of Protestants,
combined with the suspicion and ill-will of Catholics. Unpopularity may be a proof of
integrity and courage, but never of policy or prudence; the wounds inflicted by opinion
are mortal for statesmen. We may recall the premature and violent end of many illus­
trious persons whom it would be inexpedient to mention here. Disgrace in public opinion
may often be great injustices, but none the less they are invariably occasions of ill-success,
and frequently of a death-sentence. In return, acts of injustice done to one individual
can and should, if they rest unrepaired, cause the loss of an entire nation or of a whole
society; this is what is called the cry of blood, for at the bottom of every injustice there
is the germ of homicide. By reason of these terrible laws of solidarity, Christianity recom­
mends so strongly the forgiveness of injuries and reconciliation. He who dies unforgiving
casts himself dagger-armed into eternity, and condemns himself to the horrors of an
eternal murder. The efficacy of paternal or maternal blessings or curses is an invincible
popular tradition and belief. As a fact, the closer the bonds which unite two persons, the
more terrible are the consequences of hatred between them. The brand of 29Althaea burn­
ing the blood of “Meleager is the Mythological Symbol of this terrible power. Let parents
be ever on their guard, for no one can kindle hell in his own blood, and devote his own
issue to misfortune, without being himself burnt and made wretched. To pardon is never
a crime, but to curse is always a danger and an evil action.
The Circle For Invocation And Conjuration
“The Black Pullet” And “The Gold Finding Hen”
This very unusual and extremely valuable Book, which contains a True and Syste­
matic account of Magical Practices, will certainly be more than welcome to the student of
Occultism and Spiritualism, as well as Magic, both Black and White, for it contains
exhaustive, and thorough information, that, if followed accurately, will prove of won­
derful efficacy for those who wish to operate these things. The tradition of this Book is
accepted without question by all learned students of Spirit Magic.
Many ask why this treatise is entitled “The Book Of Black Magic And Of Pacts.” The
answer is that it deals with the Rituals of Spirit invocation, as well as the Kabbalistic
Doctrines. It is published privately by de Laurence exclusively for those who wish to
become learned expositors of Ceremonial Magic. It shows the difference between White
and Black Magic. Explains the Talismans of the Sage of the Pyramids. Explains the
Seven Mysterious 31Orisons.

Marvelous Illustrations
This is, indeed, a most important and curious Book. It is a true and accurate transla­
tion of the original. It is divided into TWO PARTS.
PART ONE contains four big Chapters dealing- with Ceremonial Magic. The Antiquity
of Magical Rituals. The Ritual of Transcendental Magic. Composite Rituals, and the
Ritual of Black Magic.
PART TWO is a complete Grimoire. Explains the Preparation of the Operator. The
Initial Rites and Ceremonies. Concerning the Descending Hierarchy. The Mysteries of
Goetic Theurgy according to the Lesser Key of Solomon, the King. Concerning the
Mystery of the Sanctum Regnum, or the Government of Evil Spirits, being the Rite of
Conjuration according to the Grimorium Verum. The Mysteries of Internal Evocation
according to the Grand Grimoire. The Methods of Honorius and Infernal Necromancy.
Words cannot express, and no explanation could ever do justice to 'this really strange
and rare book. It deals with Necromantic Pursuits, Funeral Monuments, and all that is
associated with Conjurations.
PLATE TWO tells you how Astrological Symbols and fja»e Zodiacal Signs are concerned
with Invocations, the Infernal Sigils of the Evil Planet|^$?fcrrits according to the “Red
Dragon.” Indeed, as stated, the full page illustrations m uiis Book are very instructive.
PLATE THREE deals with the Mystic Figures of the 33Enchiridion.
We will now tell about “The Black Pullet,” the “Druid of Menapienne,” and “Red
Magic, or the Cream of the Occult Sciences.” “The Black Pullet” now forms a part of
this book.
“The Black Pullet” disappeared from print. However, it reappeared during different
periods in the past ages with slight, if any, alterations. This Book, “The Black Pullet,”
appeared once under the title of “Treasure of the Old Man of the Pyramids/’ It later
appeared under the title of the “Black Screech Owl.” This amazing book, “The Black
Pullet,” which is now contained in this book, “The Book of Black Magic And Of Pacts,”
was reprinted at Paris. “The Black Pullet,” or the “Hen With The Golden Eggs,” com­
prises the Science of Magic Talismans and Rings, the Art of Necromancy and of the Kab­
balah, for the Conjuration of Astral and Infernal Spirits, of the Sylphs and Gnomes. By it
you will acquire the Secret Sciences for the Discovery of Treasures, for obtaining power
to command all beings, and to unmask all Sciences and Bewitchments. The whole follow­
ing the Doctrines of Socrates, Pythagoras, Zoroaster, Son of the Grand Aromasis, and
other philosophers whose works in manuscript escaped, the burning of the Library of

Doctors Mizzaboula- Jabamia, Danhuzerus, Nehmahmiah, Judahim, and Eliaeb. Rendered

Only two well did the Ancients know that a Magician of Greater Power might be able
to enforce many strange and desirable things. Indeed, it has often been said of the
Egyptian Mystic that the Mastery of the whole world would pass into the hands of the
possessor of the Key To The Rituals of—White or Black, Composite or Transcendental
Magic. To understand Transcendental Rituals one can become a Magician of Greater
Power.
In the past many books have been back-dated, others are missing, such as Olympic
Magic, Magic of Apollonius, Hermetic or Egyptian Magic as well as Prophetical Magic.
The reason for this is that it was always considered dangerous to place this knowledge
in the hands of unscrupulous persons. However, it is believed that the students, on our
Mailing List, are exempt from any such charge, and that they desire to learn Spiritual
Exhortations, which are rare and quite exceptional, and must, indeed, rank among the
most exalted of their kind.

The one who possesses Occult Wisdom, and a knowledge of the Spiritual Essences of
things, as well as a knowledge of the Secret Virtues of Natural things, must aspire to the
attainment of honors and dignities, the in-gathering of much money, the foundation of a
good family, and good fortune in mercantile pursuits. The prolongation of life, the trans­
mutation of metals, and the Talismanic cure of all diseases. Other “paradoxes of the
highest science,” also are worked out by this Science.
Revelations Of An Occult And Spiritual World
To become an Adept in the Rituals of Secret Magic: to understand the Invocations of
either White or Black Magic, one must have great faith, strict 31 taciturnity, and even
justice in the things of daily life, and finally the Adept is brought forth, impregnated with
knowledge. Magical Knowledge means Magical Power.
The revelations of an Occult and Spiritual World, as well as the phenomena of the
/ Astral Light, give man a Divinatory Soul; for generally speaking, Magical Power should,
and can, be acquired by those who seek it.
Obtaining Favor And Love Of The Opposite Sex
The experiments and directions, as well as the processes for obtaining favor and love
of the opposite sex, as set forth in “The Book Of Black Magic And Of Pacts” makes it a
very valuable work for those who seek the means of Spells, and for Philters to compel
the desire of women. To compel and force the love and desire of men. To be rich in
worldly goods, to trample on ones enemies, and to gratify the desires of life.
In this strange and wonderful Book you are taught how to conjure Spirits of Love.
To cause a girl to seek you out, however prudent she may be, and again what Is told con­
cerning the experiment of invisibility, as well as the information given by the wondrous
legend of the Hand of Glory, all of this should be in the possession of every one who
desires to be a well-equipped student of these things. Before closing we must mention
also that "The Book Of Black Magic And Of Pacts” tells much concerning the Mirror ol

Explanation Of Illustrations In The Book Of Black Magic And Of Pacts
PLATE I—Frontispiece.—Edward Kelley, the Alchemist and alleged Magician, in the act of
invoking the Spirit of a Deceased Person.
The plate is reproduced from the second edition of Ebenezer Sibley’s "Illustration of the
Occult Sciences.” The companion of Kelley within the circle is presumably Paul Waring,
who, according to Weaver (“Funereal Monuments,” 1631, pp. 45, 46), was associated with him
in all his conjurations. The scene is intended to represent the churchyard of Walton Ledale,
"in the county of Lancaster.” The information of Sibley is derived from Weaver, whose
authority is said to have been Waring. On this point and the general question of Kelley’s
necromantic pursuits, see "The Alchemical Writings of Edward Kelley,’’ Biographical
Preface, pp xxvii-xxx.
PLATE IT—The Angels of the Seven Planets, their Sigils, the Signs and Houses of the Plan­
ets, the names of the Seven Heavens, according to the “Magical Elements” of Peter de
Abano, with the names of the Olympic Spirits of the Planets according to "Arbatel of
Magic,” and these Infernal Sigils of the Evil Planetary Spirits according to the “Red
Dragon.”
The name of Michael, the Angel of the Lord’s Day, appears over his Sigil, together with
the Astrological Symbol of Sol, the Zodiacal Sign of Leo, which is the House of the Sun, and
the name of the Fourth Heaven, Machen. The name of Gabriel, the Angel of Monday, appears
over his Sigil, together with the Astrological Symbol of Luna, the Zodiacal sign of Cancer,
which is the House of the Moon, and the name of the First Heaven, Shamain. The name of
Samael, the Angel of Tuesday, appears over his Sigil, together with the Astrological Symbol
of Mars, the Zodiacal Signs of Aries, and Scorpio which are the Houses of the Planet, and the
name of the Fifth Heaven, Machon. The name of Raphael, the Angel of Wednesday, appears
over his Sigil, together with the Astrological Symbol of Mercury, the Zodiacal Signs of
Gemini and Virgo, which are the Houses of the Planet, and the name of the Second Heaven,
Raquie. The name of Sachiel, the Angel of Thursday, appears over his Sigil, together with
the Astrological Symbol of Jupiter, the Zodiacal Signs of Sagittarius and Pisces, which are
the Houses of the Planet, and the name of the Sixth Heaven, Zebul. The name of Anael, the
angel of Friday, appears over his Sigil, together with the Astrological Symbol of Venus, the
Zodiacal Signs of Taurus and Libra, which are the Houses of the Planet, and the name of the
Third Heaven, Sagun. The name of Cassiel the Angel of Saturday, appears over his Sigi:,
together with the Astrological Symbol of Saturn, and the Zodiacal Signs of Capricornus and
Aquarius, which are the Houses of the Planet.
PLATE m—Mystic Figures of the Enchiridion.
Figure I., the mystic symbol of the Tau, converted into a monogram which has been
supposed to signify the word Taro of Tora. Figure n, the triple Tau. Figure HI, an arbi­
trary figure supposed to represent the fortieth part of the stature of Jesus Christ. Figure
IV, the Labarum of Constantine, with the usual inscription, “In this sign thou shalt conquer,”
and the emblems of the Passion of Christ. Figure V, a double door, connected by a bar and
inscribed with the first seven letters of the Latin alphabet. Figure VI, a composite symbol
of unknown meaning. The second circle contains twenty-two letters, which recall the Keys
of the Taro. Figure VII represents the dimensions of the wound produced by the lance of
the Centurion in the side of Jesus Christ. Figure VHI, a two-edged sword, for which various
simple meanings may be conjectured. Its inscription has been adopted by alchemists.
PLATE IV—Mystic Figures of the Enchiridion.
Figure I, the reversed form of a well-known occult symbol. The Hebrew words signify
Jehovah, Elohim, Agla, Elohim Tsabaoth. Figure II, the Labarum of Constantine, another
form. Figure III, the inscription on this talisman is unintelligible. Figure IV, the occult
symbol of the pentagram, reversed, and therefore the sign of the Demon, according to
Eliphas Levi. Possibly misplaced by the ignorance of the printer, but it occurs in this
manner in many books which do not apparently connect with Black Magic. Figure V, a
talisman with the monogram of Michael. Figure VI, undescribed, but belonging to a prayer
of St. Augustine addressed to the Holy Spirit to receive a revelation. Figure ATI, the char­
acters of this talisman would seem to be Hebrew, but are so corrupt that they are unintel­
ligible. Figure VIII, a talisman with the monogram of Gabriel. Figure IX, the talisman and
monogram of Michael.
PLATE V—The characters of Evil Spirits, from the so-called "Fourth Book” of Cornelius
Agrippa, and described as follows in the original.
1. A right line; 2. a crooked line; 3. a reflexed line; 4. a simple figure; 5. penetrate:
6. broken; L a right letter; 8. a retrograde letter; 9. an inverted letter; 10. flame; 11. wind;
12. water; 13. a mass; 14. rain; 15. clay; 16. a flying creature; 17. a creeping thing; 18. a
serpent; 19. an eye; 20. a hand; 21. a foot 22. a crown; 23. a crest; 24. horns; 25. a sceptre;
26. a sword; 27. a scourge.
PLATE VI—The Sabbatic Goat, from the "Ritual Of Transcendental Magic,” by Eliphas Levi,
who identifies it with the Baphomet of Mendes, and does not regard it as connected
with Black Magic,” but as “a pantheistic and magical figure of the absolute.”
PLATE VII—The instruments of Black Magic, from the Grimoire entitled “True Black
Magic.”
Figure I, the knife with the white handle. Figure II, the knife with the black handle.
Figure III, the arctrave, or hook. Figure IV, the boline or sickle. Figure V, the stylet.
Figure VI the needle. Figure VII, the wand. Figure VIII, the lancet. Figure IX, the staff
Figure X, the sword of the master. Figures XI, XII, XIII, the swords of the assistants.
PLATE VIII—The Magical Circle used in Goetic Theurgy, according to the "Lesser Key Of
Solomon The King,” showing the position of the operator, the divine names and symbols
to be inscribed within and about the double circle, and the situation of the lights.
The figure and place of the triangle into which the spirit is commanded will be found in
the text, pp. 190-192. The Divine Names differ in some of the manuscripts.
PLATE IX—The Goetic Circle Of Black Evocations And Pacts, according to Eliphas Levi.
The circle is formed from the skin of the victim, fastened to the ground by four nails
taken from the coffin of an executed criminal. The skull is that of a parricide; the horns
those of a goat; the male bat opposite the skull must have been drowned in blood; and the
black cat, whose head forms the fourth object on the circumference of the circle, must have
been fed on human flesh. There is no authority for any of these stipulations'. The small
circles within the triangle show the place of the operator and his assistants.
PLATE X—The Apparatus of Ceremonial Crystallomancy according to White Magic, show­
ing the crystal in a frame, which should be of polished ebony, ivory, or boxwood, the
torch, and the engraven candlesticks of brass.
The process of Ceremonial Crystallomancy is analogous to that of the Mirror of Solomon,

This is a really Good Book. The Work of a Master. It embraces Secret Knowledge

Evil Spirits by Incantations. This Book gives the only true and Ancient method of
Exorcism as practiced throughout Egypt and Oriental Lands, such as Islam, as well as
among the Hindus and the Mohammedans.
According to Rabbincial Tradition 88King Solomon, the wise man, had power over
Demons and Evil Spirits by the means of Talismans. You should have the same power.
The fame of this Great Book has been spread far and wide through Oriental Lands, has
been translated and is now a part of the Literature of Islam. It is, indeed, a rare and!

Saul And An Evil Spirit
Now the spirit of the Eternal departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Eternal
scared him. So Saul’s courtiers said to him: “Here is an evil spirit from God scaring' you!
Let your servants now before you offer a suggestion; let them discover some skilful player
on the lyre; then whenever the evil spirit overpowers you, he shall play music, and you
will get better.” Saul answered his courtiers: “Look me out a man who plays well, and
bring him to me.”
(David was then brought). And whenever the evil spirit frdfn God overpowered Saul,
David would take the lyre and play music, till Saul breathed freely; then all would be
well and the evil spirit would depart from him. (1 Sam. xvi, 14 sq.) (Moffat's edit.)
.... Next day an evil spirit from God overpowered Saul, and he raved within his house.
David was playing music for him as usual, and Saul had a spear in his hand; he raised
the spear, saying to himself: “I will pin David to the wall.” But David evaded him twice
over. (1 Sam. xviii, 10 sq.) (ibid).
.... an evil spirit from the Eternal overpowered Saul as he sat in his house, spear
in hand. David was playing music, and Saul tried to pin David to the wall with his spear.
But David slipped aside from Saul, and he drove the spear into the wall. (1 Sam. xix, 9 sq.)
(ibid).

Spirits, both good and evil. Most remarkable book of its kind ever published. After
announcement there were 12,568 copies of this work sold before the American Edition
could be printed and bound. The Second Edition is being printed, and an order has
been placed for the printing and binding of the Third Edition. This Masterpiece,
of 400 pages, shows the terrible result of the Spell of Witchcraft and Obsession; how
men, women and children have been tormented by unclean and evil spirits. Read
this book and learn of the pitiful and heart-rending pleadings of those who have
been Obsessed by evil earth-bound spirits.
In this book you learn why there are so many suicides, so much sickness, dis­
ease and premature death; how Evil Spirits Obsess sensitives so that they become
paralyzed, epileptic and insane. History shows that Evil Spirits hover around the
earth like a dense cloud, full of remorse, anguish, and repentance. Again, Evil
Spirits, full of revenge, hate and evil, Obsess and influence people in every part of
the world.
Angels are exalted beings and inspire peace, harmony, purity and goodness.
Earth-bound depraved spirits inspire hate, jealousy, revenge, and bring about dis­
cord. Vampires absorb and appropriate the vitality of human beings. Demoniac
Spirits, that is, evil demons, cause sickness, pain, insanity, suicide, and death.
Every interested person should order and study this Miracle Book Of The Age,
and learn how Evil Spirits torture and incite vile habits, vicious crimes, and
murder.
Here is a Masterpiece that gives full knowledge of a difficult and dangerous
subject; testimony that is unimpeachable. A volume that is replete with excellent
information. It has a noble mission to fulfill. It is useless to attempt to deny its
great worth; because it tells the truth and is needed by the world.
The only work ever published which shows that multitudes of spirits with evil
habits seek to gratify their desires through sensitives. This book should be in the
hands of every Spiritualist, every Occult Student, and every one who is interested
in the Psychology of Spiritualism; for it presents an array of evidence in regard to
Evil Spirits and their disastrous work.

Obsession And Possession Continued
OBSESSED BY UNDEVELOPED SPIRITS
Read this book and you will be convinced that many of the so-called insane are
actually Obsessed by undeveloped spirits, for it speaks with no uncertainty, and shows
that Obsession by Evil Spirits is a fact of nature—a deplorable one. This book teems
with examples of the dangers of promiscuous spirit sittings, and will repay thought­
ful reading. Its vast amount of statistics on Obsession, Possession, Sorcery, Witch­
craft, and the Black Art, as well as Multiple Personality, is worth thousands of dollars.
This work is a terrific unveiling of the dark side of Obsession and Possession by
Evil Spirits. It is thrilling, and has a thousand uses. It is interesting and valuable,
being a truthful portrayal of existing conditions of Sorcery, Witchcraft, Obsession,
Possession, and the Black Art.
To the Spiritualist, this work comes as a Guide Book—a warning, which points
out the pitfalls on the pathway of life.
No wonder that over 12,000 copies were sold after announcement, and before
publication. No wonder that those who have ordered and studied it advise that it be
thoroughly read and fully comprehended; because the teachings of this remarkable
book are helpful. It is a timely work. The world needs it; for the facts in it are'
genuine. It is a book for the times.
de Laurence never edited and published a more entertaining, reasonable or thor­
oughly useful volume than this. It is a valuable addition to the great library of Spirit­
ualism and Occultism.
Here is a work that throws a search light and side lights on Witchcraft, the
Black Art, Obsession, and Possession by Evil Spirits. It sounds the alarm. It is a
safe-guard, because it touches upon and expounds a much neglected subject. It will
be hailed with thankfulness. It is timely and useful. A Masterpiece on the subject,—
valuable references to facts, and clear instruction to ward off Evil Spirits and Influ­
ences. The most opportune book of the century. The most practical and important
work put out by The de Laurence Company in the last 35 years. In fact, it is the only
Official and Standard Work which treats of Demonism, Possession, and Spirit-Obses­
sion so common today in Spiritualism, Psychicism, and conventional Psychology. Ob­
session is known to all students who have studied the deeper phases of Oriental and
Occidental Occultism.
The author of this remarkable book pulls aside the curtain—he tells the truth
about Obsession by spirits—he explains everything connected with Sorcery, Witch­
craft and the Black Art. It is a well-known fact that thousands and thousands of
persons are Obsessed and don’t know it; by spirits either good or evil. Nobody should
remain ignorant of what this book teaches and explains. No more should human
eyes be closed to the overwhelming evidence regarding Obsession. People should
learn how to avoid and cast out Evil Spirits. This large volume gives a description of
over 200 cases of Obsession and Possession by spirits—descriptions of Obsession in
North America, South America, Europe, Africa, India, China, Japan, and Oriental
lands. It treats of the Demonism of the Ancient Greeks, as well as New Testament
Demonism—Methodist and early Obsession, etc.
This book explains Obsession and Demonism of every age. Its learned author
has made a careful investigation in every part of the civilized world. He gives a;
mass of overwhelming testimony in this book.

book of the age. It is at least 200 years ahead of its time. It is in a class by itself;

owning a copy of it.”
A Spiritualist Wrote: “I am pleased, glad, and thankful that at last de Laurence

Obsession and Possession by Evil Spirits. After reading this book I am convinced
that it will give a large number of people the truth regarding this matter.”
A Lecturer On Spiritualism Cordially Indorsed This Famous Book, Saying: “It
is most valuable—excellent,—it tells the truth and is needed by the student of Spirit­

Read This And Then Decide Whether Or Not You Believe In Evil Spirits
Some strolling Jewish exorcists also undertook to pronounce the name of the Lord
Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying: “I adjure you to the Jesus whom Paul
preaches!” The seven sons of Sceuas, a Jewish high priest, used to do this. But the evil
spirit retorted, "Jesus I know and Paul I know, but you—who are you?” And the man
in whom the evil spirit resided leapt at them, overpowered them all, and belaboured them,
till they rushed out of the house stripped and wounded. (Acts xix 13-16.)
Now there was a man with an unclean spirit in their synagogue, who at once shrieked
out, "Jesus of Nazareth, what business have you with us? We know who you are, you are
God's holy One.” But Jesus checked it; “Be quiet,” he said, "come out of him.” And after
convulsing him the unclean spirit did come out of him with a loud cry. (Mark i 23-27.)
A man from the crowd answered him. "Teacher, I brought my son to you; he has a
dumb spirit, and whenever it seizes him it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth
and grinds his teeth. He is wasting away with it; so I told your disciples to cast it out,
but they could not.” He answered them, “O faithless generation, how long must I still
be with you? How long have I to bear with you? Bring him to me.” So they brought the
boy to him, and when the spirit saw Jesus it at once convulsed the boy; he fell on t'he
ground and rolled about foaming at the mouth. Jesus asked his father, "How long has he
been like this?” “From childhood,” he said; "it has thrown him into fire and water many
a time, to destroy him. If you can do anything, do help us, do have pity on us.” Jesus
said to him, " ‘If you can'! Anything can be done for one who believes.” At once the father
of the boy cried out, “I do believe; help my unbelief.” Now as Jesus saw that a crowd was
rapidly gathering, he checked the unclean spirit. "Deaf and dumb spirit,” he said, "leave
him, I command you, and never enter him again.” And it did come out, after shrieking
aloud and convulsing him violently. The child turned like a corpse, so that most people
said, “He is dead”; but, taking his hands, Jesus raised him and he got up (Mark ix 17-27.
Same story in Matthew xvii 14-21, and Luke ix 35-45).
Then a blind and dumb demoniac was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the
dumb man spoke and saw. (Matt, xii 22.)
When he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath; there was a woman
who for eighteen years had suffered weakness from an evil spirit; indeed she was bent
double and quite unable to raise herself. Jesus noticed her and called to her, "Woman, you
are released from your weakness." He laid hands on her, and instantly she became erect
and glorified God. (Luke xiii 10-13.)

AMAZING
The Strangest Book Ever Published
THE HUMAN HEART
This marvelous book, translated from the
original French into the German in the year 1732,
and later translated from the German into
English, sets forth most astounding facts. It ex­
plains that the human heart is either a Temple of
God and knows no evil, or is a Workshop of the
Devil and Evil Spirits. Positively the only book
ever published-showing that the heart of a man
is so constituted that he is either ruled by good
spirits, or controlled by vicious evil spirits. No
other work ever set forth so plainly how malignant,
evil, earthbound spirits are able to obsess and
exert a mysterious and fatal control over anyone
whose heart is not a Temple of God and the Holy
Spirit.
This wonderful hook contains eleven full page
illustrations and representations.
(Continued On Next Page)
THE de LAURENCE COMPANY 265
THE HUMAN HEART CONTINUED
Illustrations And Representations Explained
ILLUSTRATION NUMBER ONE, is an actual representation of the condition of
the heart of a man who is obsessed and controlled by evil spirits, and while subject
to, and controlled by evil, earthbound spirits, he is incited to laziness, impurity,
gluttony, drunkenness, envy, sensuality, anger, and murder.
ILLUSTRATION NUMBER TWO, is an actual representation of the condition
of the heart of a repentant sinner in whom evil spirits, and evil influences are being
overcome, and begin to fall away. This wonderful illustration shows how one who
has had evil influences around him becomes frightened, turns upon himself and looks
deeply into his heart, feeling more happy that he is being freed from evil spirits,
and that his heart and soul is no more annoyed by malignant spirits who manifest
themselves in the form of abominable animals.
ILLUSTRATION NUMBER THREE, is an actual representation of the condition
of the heart of a man who has been freed from sin, evil spirits, and bad influences.
ILLUSTRATION NUMBER FOUR, is an actual representation of the condition
of the heart of a man who, regained through Christ, is reconciled, and his soul knows
no more evil, having been entirely freed of the influence of evil spirits. He is happy
because evil influences have been conquered and driven away.
ILLUSTRATION NUMBER FIVE, is an actual representation of the condition
of the heart of a man which has become a Temple of Righteousness, and a dwelling
place of the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost.
ILLUSTRATION NUMBER SIX, is an actual representation of the condition of
the heart of a man who has become susceptible, and is giving himself up to the influ­
ence of evil spirits, and is becoming lazy, despondent, imprudent, and easy to anger.
In such a condition he is subject to animal-like influences which obsess and over­
come him.
ILLUSTRATION NUMBER SEVEN, is an actual representation of the condition
of the heart of a man who, after his conversion, has again been overcome by evil
earthbound animal-like spirits. When the heart and soul of a man become obsessed
by an unclean spirit he seeks but knows no rest, because evil spirits are happy only
when they make a man follow the path of the devil, and charm him to sin and the
lust of the world.
ILLUSTRATION NUMBER EIGHT, is an actual representation of the condition
of the death of a man who has been lost to God, and has become a servant to sin
because of the control and obsession of evil.
This wonderful illustration actually shows the sinner as he lies on his death-bed,
with his body full of pain, and his spirit anxious and fearful, full of dismay and
terror before Death—full of horror of the coming judgment. When death comes to
a man of this kind, evil spirits show him his sins toward which he has been drawn,
and the evil influence that attracted him. At death he fears them because evil spirits
and bad influences mean eternal destruction and eternal damnation; for it should be
remembered that what we sow we reap.
Particularly awful is the death of this type of a man who has had the oppor­
tunity to receive the grace and goodness of God, but who has allowed evil and unclean
spirits to enter his soul.
ILLUSTRATION NUMBER NINE, is an actual representation of the condition of
the heart of a good Christian who persisted in the battle against sin and evil influ­
ences, and is now enjoying God’s holiness for all time.
In this ninth picture or representation you actually see how the heart of a man
is surrounded on all sides with enemies; Satan and sin always lurk about him, seek­
ing to overcome him and obsess his heart with an unclean spirit. Shows how the
good man is tempted; how evil spirits seek to frighten and influence him to evil.
However, the spirit of Christ, and the glory of God is always battling with these
enemies of holiness, and the heart of the good man, which has become a Temple of
God, is armed against them—they are not able to conquer him, because angels and
good spirits hover around him. The grace of God keeps his heart always alert for the
battle, and keeps him firm against evil. No one gains a crown who does not fight for
the right, and he who stands firm against evil becomes blessed. In the heart of such
a man the star of hope shines clearly, for his faith is a living faith which alwaysl
conquers evil spirits.

THE HUMAN HEART CONTINUED
ILLUSTRATION NUMBER TEN, is an actual representation of the death of a
good and pious man. This picture actually shows him on his death-bed surrounded
by the peace and the love of God. This marvelous picture shows the spirit leaving
the physical body and passing to good spirits and angels who say: “Come unto me.”
This is positively one of the most remarkable death-bed pictures ever shown of one
who has constantly lived and believed in the love and faith of God until the end. He
lays himself down, when his last hour comes, happily and trustingly on his death-bed.
He fears neither death or the judgment, because neither touch him,, as Jesus has
assured us when He said: “He that heareth my word, and believeth in Him that sent
me, hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from
death unto life.” (John 5.24.)
In this representation, before your very eyes, lays the righteous one, peaceful in
his knowledge that he has never allowed an unclean spirit to overcome or obsess
him. He knows that his sins are forgiven and he is joyful because his heart is a
Temple of God and the Holy Spirit. He folds his hands in fervent prayer to God.
His soul is filled with the love of Christ in whom he has lived and died. Even in the
face of the one who- has become cold in death shines forth the inner freedom, the
Godly trust, the holy anointing of the good clean spirit which lived in his heart. His
heart and soul are directed toward heaven. Even his lips which have become speech­
less and cold in death, seem to say: “I am happy with Christ.” The angel of God
waits above his soul until his days are ended, in order to take it unto God’s place.
So dies the righteous whose heart is a Temple of God and the Holy Spirit. A
beautiful departure takes the pious from the battle and sorrow of sin and evil.
ILLUSTRATION NUMBER ELEVEN, is a marvelous representation showing
that if one would be free from mischievous, unclean earthbound spirits, he must
enter into life at the straight gate, and have his heart a Temple of God and the Holy
Spirit. In this illustration there are shown two gates; the straight and narrow gate
which leads to peace, faith, and happiness here and after death, and the wide gate;
broad is its way, for it leads to destruction. Many there are who enter the wide
gate which leads to sin, obsession, crime and wrongdoing. Let the one who reads
here always remember that straight is the gate and narrow the way which leads one
to a pure and peaceful life. As shown in this illustration, there are but few that
enter the straight and narrow gate.
Much more might be written regarding these eleven full page illustrations
which are actual pictures or representations of the heart of a man, which is a Temple
of God and the Holy Spirit, as well as the heart of a man whd has lived a sinful life
and has become obsessed by evil, earthbound, malignant spirits.
Published For Those Interested In Good Spirits
As Well As Those Poor Human Souls Tormented By Evil Spirits
Before going further into the subject of Evil Spirits, the reader should understand
o'nce and for all, that there is a certain kind of an Occult and Magical energy, based on
the existence of a spiritual world, placed without and not within the human heart. This
Occult, Magical energy manifests itself either as good or evil within the human heart,
that is to say, that the human heart becomes either a Temple of God, or a Workshop of
malignant evil spirits.
That one can enter into communication with spirits, both good and evil, by the use
of certain Magical Arts, and Occult Practices, has been proven in all ages of the world.
All of this today, as in ages long ago, has been demonstrated as a fact.
Sorcery, Black Magic, And Witchcraft are intimately connected with Evil Spirits.
The difference between them is, that in witchcraft all those who practice it sell them­
selves to vicious evil spirits.
The principle means by which evil spirits enter the heart of man, exert their
power, and carry on their intercourse with this world, are to be found in the many
forms of evil obsession. Evil earthbound spirits are invisible beings. Evil spirits
are many times disembodied souls of criminals and suicides. Souls of this kind, that
have passed on to the spiritual world, may be sent into the heart of man by evil
charms and spells by those who practice witchcraft.
That an evil spirit can enter the heart of man and break him down as easily
as a fearful hurricane sweeps all before it, attacking his heart, soul and body in many
places at the same time, without his being able to perceive the evil spirit, or being
able to protect himself because he has not been properly instructed, has been proven
for thousands of years In fact, in all ages of the world the conjuration of evil spirits,
sorcery and witchcraft means practically a full realization of demonology.

THE HUMAN HEART CONTINUED
On every page, and in every illustration of this wonderful book, these things are
explained, shown, and set forth. All this may be too strange to believe, yet because
the reader is ignorant of their existence, it does not follow that they are not true, as
the sad, miserable, heart-rending records of obsession and witchcraft abundantly
testify.
Christ said, “Know thyself.” Men and women today do not know themselves,
therefore, they do not understand the things of the inner or spiritual world. This is
a material age. Most everybody believes in materialism and things of the material
world. Everybody should possess the knowledge of both the good and bad things of
tne spiritual world as well. If one does not know these strange and wonderful things
he cannot truly say they are not true. He who is capable of successfully seeking and
knowing the work of both good and evil spirits is fortunate indeed; for true growth
depends upon one’s knowledge of the spiritual world as well as the material. It is
not wise to base conclusions upon external appearances caused by the illusions of
the outward senses.
Only Book Published That Helps One To Overcome Evil Conditions
Everyone who orders this, the strangest book ever published, will find plenty
therein regarding external evil forces and spirits, and the terrible results once they
enter and obsess the heart and human soul. All this, and a great deal more is explained
and set forth in this marvelous book. It gives a warning which is important.
Evil Spirits, once they obsess a person, are far more powerful in their action for
evil than is generally believed. Good spirits create good. Evil spirits, attracted by
evil minded persons, incite them mentally to crime. Among many criminals their
only excuse is that, they thought they kept hearing something tell them to commit
crime. Bad suggestions are sometimes given to people by evil spirits, until they
become obsessed and are really driven to commit crime. These suggestions and evil
thou^its are from depraved astral bodies of obsessed persons who have passed to the
spiritual world, and because of their criminal mind have become earthbound spirits,
that obsess both men and women with full consciousness and intent to work injury
and evil.
The real necessity of invoking good spirits to drive out and control evil spirits
cannot be too strongly insisted upon. Disbelief in evil spirits is fatal; for it checks
and stops the action of the human will from protecting one against evil. A child
learns to walk because it is full of confidence and faith that it can do it. All great
teachers of religion and occultism have invariably insisted upon the necessity of
faith in God and the good spirits of the astral plane as a means of protection against
evil spirits.
This strange book explains why it pays to be good and to earnestly follow
instruction regarding good and evil spirits. If you are pure in mind and have devel­
oped the clairvoyant faculty which is latent in every human being, and which is based
on the utlization of the good in the human heart, you will always be happy and lead
a peaceful and successful life.
The knowledge set forth in this book teaches one how to become powerful and
protect himself against evil spirits, and he who studies this book will be fully repaid
for his time and trouble.
Further, this remarkable book, which was translated from the original French
into the German in the year 1732, and later translated from the German into English,
as well as the eleven full page illustrations, has been published at an enormous
expense, solely as a help to those faithful souls who desire knowledge and wisdom
regarding spirits both good and evil.
Read This If You Wish To Be Helped
Following’ each of the TEN MARVELOUS ILLUSTRATIONS and their Explanation,
there is given in this amazing book, a suitable prayer to be said by one who is Obsessed
or suffering from Witchcraft, Failure, or an Evil Influence, and who wishes to be helped.

THE GREATER KEY OF SOLOMON
Translation From Ancient
Manuscripts In The British Museum
A Precise Exposition Of King Solomon’s
Secret Procedure; Its Mysteries And Magic Rites
The 1916 de Laurence American Edition
By Solomon, The “Wise Man.” Solomon, Son Of David And Bathsheba, (1033-975
B. C.): King of Israel; noted for his Wisdom and .deep Knowledge of Occult Forces;
author of the “Key Of Solomon.” Solomon was a King; the son of a King; the wise
son of a wise father; a righteous man’s righteous child. David, the father of Solomon,
reigned for forty years, as it is written, “And the days that David governed Israel
were forty years.” Of Solomon, it is written, “And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem
over all Israel forty years.” Solomon was born in the year 2912 B. C., and reigned
over Israel forty years. Four hundred and thirty-three years

What The Popular Traditions Of Magic Affirm. The popular traditions of Magic
affirm that he who possesses The Key Of Solomon can .communicate with Spirits
of all grades. These Keys, so often lost, and as often again recovered, are no other
than the Talismans of the 72 different names and the Mysteries of the 32 Hiero­
glyphical Paths. By the aid of these Signs, it is possible, so it is claimed, to arrive
at the natural and mathematical Revelation of all Secrets of nature.
Remained For Centuries In Manuscript Form, The Key Of Solomon, save for curtailed
copies published in France in the Seventeenth Century, remained for centuries in Manu­
script form in the innermost recesses of great libraries. As the fountain-head of Cabalisti­
cal Magic, and the origin of Ceremonial Magic of Mediaeval times, it has ever been valued
as a work of highest authority. Josephus, the Jewish Historian, mentions the Magical
work attributed to Solomon; this is confirmed by many Eastern traditions, as his Magical
skill is frequently mentioned by the old Adepts.
The American Edition. This, The de Laurence 1916 American Edition,* is an exact
reproduction of the 1888 London Edition, which was edited by the. translator, S. Liddell
Mac Gregor Mathers, from several Ancient Manuscripts in the British Museum. The Manu­
scripts from which it was edited by the Translator are:—Add. Manuscript, 10,862; Sloane
Manuscripts, 1307 and 3091; Harleian Manuscript, 3981; King’s Manuscripts, 288; and
Lansdowne Manuscripts, 1202 and 1203; Seven Codices in all. Of all these, 10,862 Add.
Manuscript is the oldest, its date being about the end of the Sixteenth Century; 3981 Har­
leian is about the middle of the Seventeenth Century; The others of rather later date.
Finest Edition Ever Published. The de Laurence 1916 American Edition of, “The Greater
Key Of Solomon,” is the finest published. It is printed on rich half-tone paper, so as to
bring out all the detail of the Seals, Charms, Pentacles, Diagrams, and Talismans con­
tained in this famous work, which is a reproduction of the 1888 London Edition Translated
from Ancient Manuscripts in the British Museum, By S. Liddell Mac Gregor Mathers. It
is bound in Full Leather, with Side Title Stamped in Gold, Gold Edges.
♦The de Laurence 1916 American Edition, and the 1920 Arabic Edition of “The Greater
Key Of Solomon,” have been published under the critical care of L. W. de Laurence, who
is an enlightened Oriental Scholar with sound knowledge of the Old World' Sacred Mys­
teries. He is also conversant with Talismanic And Ceremonial Magic, as well as the
various Evocations, having made a life-long study of Talismans, Seals, Sigils, and Magical

TWO FAMOUS BOOKS
THE GREATER KEY OF SOLOMON
AND RAPHAEL’S ANCIENT MANUSCRIPT
These two books will give the student all the knowledge that can ever be obtained on the
subject of Charms and Talismans, their construction and use. Charms and Talismans,
carried by thousands to-day in a Genuine Leather Talisman Case, form one phase in the
universal belief in these famous agents and their Recondite Powers. The Ancient Phylac­
teries worn by Mohammedan and Jewish women, who have unbounded faith in their work­
ing efficacy, is also an example of the charm in every form. Faith in their working efficacy
is essential. This is certainly true of all Talismans and Seals Of Spirits constructed ac­
cording to the rules of Kabalistic art. It was not the motive of the Ancient Masters of the
Kabala to stimulate or encourage the popular faith. Only the faithful Disciple and Neophyte
were allowed to wear a Talisman. Those who were not earnest in their desire for assistance
and the acquisition of knowledge were never allowed behind the Secret Veil Of Occultism.
Magical Squares and Pentacles of the old world Masters are of a most elaborate nature.
To their construction these famous magicians added the knowledge of Astrology and
planetary influences; a secret knowledge of the names of the Celestial Powers; and the
magical faculty of the human soul as expressed in the Will and The Astral Light. They
made careful selection of times for their work, choosing the day and hour of the planet
under which a Talisman was to be made, taking? care that the planet was suitably situated
in the heavens by aspect, and making their operations in such surroundings as the Occult
Forces of Nature has sealed to the service of such work. All this is fully explained to the
student in these bdoks. At this day there are none who are capable of constructing their
own Talismans unless they learn these things after the manner of the Ancient Astrologers;
the very same being fully taught and plainly shown in “THE GREATER KEY OF SOLO­
MON” and "RAPHAEL’S ANCIENT MANUSCRIPT” herein referred to. Some time ago
there was published throughout the world a history of the famous Rothschild Talisman,
which is an heirloom, and on the possession of which the fortune of the Rothschild Family
is believed to depend. This famous Talisman is in the form of a small gold casket, but the
secret of its power lies hidden in the magical words inscribed within it. Napoleon was a
great believer in charms, and wore upon his body a Talisman given him by one of the
priests after the Nile Expedition. <
Talismans are largely in use in America and Europe; they are also worn by Arabs,
Persians, and Hindus, while in Africa, among} native tribes, the Obeyah is much in repute.
Captain Bancroft, a great student of the Occult, reports that in Abyssinia he discovered
races of giants who inhabit the devil-possessed dirstrict of Walamo. There were many vic­
tims of the Magical Power of these mysterious people, and there are few that were able
to explain their secret work. The inhabitants of the district of Walamo use a Magical
Power and no Abyssinian can approach or harm the tribe. In the United States, Europe,
and, indeed, every country in the world, we have instances of bewitching, and the Magical
Power of Talismans, and the “evil-eye.” Students and makers of Talismans rely purely
upon the Occult and Hidden Powers they4 are believed to possess. To these are added cer­
tain words, said to have a power, and as by the WORD the Universe was created, certain
secret Hidden Forces of Nature spring into1 activity.
Therefore, all Occult operations, that are done under a good influence, comes to good
effect, whether by Sigil, Charm, or Talismans. This is effected by faith of the operator,
aided by the WILL and Astral Forces. The Astral Light or Force is a great creative power
used by the mind which is a mold delivered to the Occult Powers of Nature for the reception
of the vitalizing elements of the Unseen Forces. For the SOUL is receptive, while the WILL
is projective. Only when, by Art Magic, the student invokes or attracts to the Talisman or
Charm the Hidden Forces, which reside in Nature, is their efficacy brought within the
control of the HUMAN WILL, as powder and shot which have been wrested from the earth
and fashioned-to a purpose. The Occult Power of the WILL and the intention of the SOUL
is one of the great cardinal points of Magic. He who constructs a Talisman, which will
produce good effects, brings about a desirable state, but he who grudges everybody all that
is good, and who hates himself, may by the use of Black Arts fashion a Talisman which
bewitches and poisons the efforts of the one whom it is supposed to operate against.
The wise reader will be able to understand all that is written here about Magic and
Talismans and realize that RAPHAEL’S ANCIENT MANUSCRIPT OF TALISMANIC MAGIC
as well as that famous book “THE GREATER KEY OF SOLOMON” are the most noted works
in print to-day on the subjects cf Talismanic Magic, Pentacles, Seals Of Spirits, and Tran­
scendental Magic. Get one or both of these books at the astonishing low price at which they
are now offered, and you will be able, not only to construct and make your own Talismans
and Charms, but you will then own two of the greatest books ever known to the world.
The two Great Volumes, spoken of here, tell you of a True and Sublime Secret Science.
They teach you to understand the mysterious influences of the spiritual world upon the
material, and of both of these upon the mind of man. They tell you plainly and truthfully
in the simple language of the ancients how* to dispose and fit yourself so as to be capable
of performing the superior operations of Talismanic Magic, whereby you may be enabled to
operate wonderful things by Talismans—to control men and their affairs, to increase riches,
to overcome enemies, to procure the favor of men, to expel disease, to preserve health, to
prolong life, to renew youth, to, foretell future events, by the operations of Natural Magic.
These things may not seem possible, yet study the Volumes of Ancient Talismanic
Magic, herein referred to, and you will realize the possibility of these things and know that
they are reasonable and true. These books can not be obtained from any one else, and
de LAURENCE holds an absolute copyright in order to prevent them from falling into the
hands of unscrupulous and curious individuals. Were dealers in rare books allowed to gain
possession of these works, they would charge no less than ten dollars apiece for them, but
it is de LAURENCE’S strict orders that they be now placed on sale at a trifle above the cost
of translating, printing, publishing, binding and advertising. As these books will have a
large sale, it would be advisable for you to place your order as soon as possible or send one
or two dollars as an advance payment, and we will box and set them aside for you until you
can forward the balance, when the books will be sent; in a special mailing case.^
Let the judicious reader know and understand, that this is positively the first time that
“THE GREATER KEY OF SOLOMON THE KING” and “RAPHAEL’S ANCIENT MANU­
SCRIPT OF TALISMANIC MAGIC” has ever been printed and sold in the United States.
These two books are most magnificently bound in Seal Grain Leather' with Gold Edges and
printed on special paper, de LAURENCE has spent years of hard work on these books,
and it has cost him several thousands dollars to place them in the hands of Occult students.
For almost four hundred years these books have been in existence, but never before
translated and published at a price within the reach of everybody.

THE GREATER KEY OF SOLOMON
(Continued From Preceding Page)
King Solomon’s Method Of Teaching
The Holy Temple. He built King Solomon’s Temple in seven years and occupied
fourteen years in erecting his Palace. He was the wise King alluded to in Proverbs
16:23, “The heart of the wise maketh his mouth intelligent, and upon his lips increaseth
information.” Meaning that if a man possessing brilliant diamonds and precious
stones, keeps his jewels concealed, no one is aware of their value; but if he allows
them to be seen, their “worth becomes known. While the wisdom of Solomon was
locked in his own breast it was of value to no one; but when he gave the world his
Four Books, they increased the information of his people. So great was his reputation
that any one in doubt concerning the meaning of a Biblical passage sought the king
for an interpretation. Not only in sacred lore did he raise the standard of education.
He had taught the sciences of Natural Philosophy, Physiology, Agriculture, Mathe­
matics, Occultism, Astronomy, Chemistry, and Rhetoric. In Occultism And “Talis­
manic Magic” he was an Adept.
Solomon’s Method Of Teaching. His method of teaching is illustrated by the fol­
lowing comparison: There was a basket without handles, filled with fine fruit, but
the owner was unable to carry it until a wise man attached handles to the basket.
So did Solomon remove difficulties from the path of the student. Rabbi Huna further
illustrated this same thing. “There was once,” he said, “a well of pure water; but so
deep that the people were not able to reach the water, until a man of wisdom, taking
a bucket, attached to it one rope after another until the whole was long enough to
reach the water.” So was it with Solomon’s teachings. The Bible is a well of truth,
but its teachings are too deep for the understanding of some. Solomon, however, in­
troduced Parables and Proverbs suited to the comprehension of all, through which
means a knowledge of the law became readily obtainable.
Translated Into Different Languages
Translated Into Different Languages. The Key Of Solomon was translated from the
original Hebrew into the following languages. Add. Manuscript, 10,862 is written in
contracted Latin. 3981 Harleian Manuscript; 282 King’s Manuscript; and 3091 Sloane
Manuscript, are all in French. The Conjurations and wordings of these are much fuller
than in 10,862 Add. Manuscript and 1202 Lansdowne Manuscript. The title is The Key
Of Solomon, King of the Hebrews, Translated from the Hebrew Language into Italian
by Abraham Colorno, by the order of his most Serene Highness of Mantua; and recently
put into French. The Pentacles are much better drawn, are in Colored Inks, and in the
case of 3091 Sloane Manuscript, Gold and Silver are employed.
1307 Sloane Manuscript is in Italian; its Title is “La Clavicola di Salomone Redotta
et epilogata nella nostra materna lingua del dottissimo Gio Peccatrix.” It is full of
Black Magic. Another Italian version bears the title of “Zecorbenei.”
1202 Lansdowne Manuscript is “The True Keys Of King Solomon,” By Ar’madel. It is
beautifully written, with painted Initial Letters, and the Pentacles are carefully drawn
in Colored Inks.

THE LESSER KEY OF SOLOMON
Goetia. The Book Of Evil Spirits
This rare book, which has been most accurately] translated from Ancient Manuscripts
now in the Britism Museum, contains nearly two hundred Diagrams, Figures, Historical
Talismans and Seals for the invocation and convocation of the Spirits of the Astral Plane.
This famous work, THE LESSER KEY OF SOLOMON, the very same being known as
"GOETIA,” THE BOOK OF EVIL SPIRITS, by SOLOMON, THE SON OF DAVID, KING OF
ISRAEL, also teaches in a clear manner Necromancy, Witchcraft, and Black Art, as well as
Ceremonial and Talismanic Magic. Again, let it be known by all who read here—That this
is the only authorized edition of THE LESSER KEY OF SOLOMON. "GOETIA,” THE
BOOK OF EVIL SPIRITS, Extant to-day. It has been published and. edited by de LAUR­
ENCE, the greatest living authority on these subjects; he being a member of THE EAST­
ERN ORDER OF SACRED MYSTERIES, as well as the only official publisher of Occult
and Spiritual books in the world. So the student is warned against spurious and counter­
feit editions of this book, for they arej both misleading and confusing to the student who
attempts to perform any of the operations contained in it or to construct any of the Talis­
mans shown therein. ,
Furthermore, let it be known that all advanced students of the Occult, and all of those
who eventually desire to become a member of THE EASTERN ORDER OF SACRED
MYSTERIES, have for years known that de LAURENCE is positively the only official
authority upon these subjects in the world. When you buy books from other firms, you
simply obtain an edition that has been printed by a common publisher who knows nothing
at all regarding the subject matter treated, in the text of the book. The result is that the
student becomes hopelessly confused, and he fails to obtain any good from his book. Every
book published by this firm is edited and passes under the critical eye of de LAURENCE.
It then becomes both a MANUAL and a TEXT book for the student, and for this reason the
buyer of books treating on these subjects should be very careful, for there are several “fake
editions” of the SIXTH AND SEVENTH BOOKS OF MOSES, as well as TRANSCENDENTAL
MAGIC and also THE BOOK OF BLACK MAGIC AND PACTS, now being sold by certain
Publishing Companies. Many times these publishers of so-called Occult books charge twice
the amount that we ask for our Standard and Authorized editions. In some cases, how­
ever, their price is less than ours, and this is where the student falls into their trap, for
when he buys their cheap books, he gains possession of something that is absolutely worth­
less to him as an instructor. This, of course, means failure in every attempt to succeed and
advance. So let this warning be heeded, and you will be saved from an unwise investment,
for we positively issue the only complete CATALOGUE of these books in the world, as de
LAURENCE controls the publishing rights of all of the standard and official books on these
subjects. His Disciples, agents and Occult students cover the world, and have sent him
from Europe, India and Egypt every single book ever written by any of the old-world
writers.
The Burning Bush
“THE LESSER KEY OF SOLOMON,” GOETIA, has been for years and years looked
upon as a very rare Manuscript known as “THE BOOK OF EVIL SPIRITS,” for therein
Kabalistic Tradition is presented simply and plainly to the student. In fact, this book is
often called “THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE.” This work deals with Magic, as well as the
Art of Enchantment, and the diverse properties! of Seals and Talismans, It gives instruc­
tion in all secrets of Sorcerers. SOLOMON was a master of the Kabalistic Art and was the
greatest teacher of Invocation and Conjuration of both the good and evil spirits of the
Astral Plain. The student who obtains this work will be brought back to the age when
such rare works as the “KABALISTIC BOOK OF ENOCH” was written; for it is here that
Kabalistic Tradition is presented, under the guise of legend to the following effect:
Adam had two sons—Cain, who signifies brute' force, and Abel, the type of intelligence
and mildness. Agreement was impossible between them; they perished at each other’s
hands; and their inheritance passed to a third son, named Seth. Here is the conflict of two
opposing Occult Forces diverted to the advantage of a synthetic and united Spiritual force.
“Now Seth, who was just, was permitted to approach as far as the entrance of the Earthly
Paradise, without being threatened by the Kerub and his flaming sword.” In other words
Seth represented primeval initiation. “It came to pass in this manner that Seth beheld
The Tree Of Knowledge and The Tree Of Life, incorporated together after such a manner
that they formed but a single tree”—signifying the harmony of science and nature in the
Transcendental Kabalah. “And the spirit gave him three seeds containing the vital power of
the said tree.” The reference is here to the Kabalistic triad. When Adam died, Seth, in obe­
dience to the directions of the spirit, placed the three seeds in the mouth of his father, as a
token of eternal life. The saplings which sprang up from these, became the Burning Bush,
in the midst of which a certain Spirit communicated to Moses his Eternal Name—signifying
He Who is and is to come. Moses plucked a triple branch of the sacred bush and used it as
his miraculous wand. Although separated from its root, the branch continued to live and
blossom, and it was subsequently preserved in the Ark. It was the Rod of Aaron, not that
of Moses, which, according to Heb. ix.. 4, was placed in the Ark of the Covenant, together
with the Tables Of The Law and the Pot of Manna. It is said, however, most clearly in
I Kings, viii. 9, that “therci was nothing in the Ark Save the Two Tables Of Stone, which
Moses put there at Horeb.” King David planted the branch on Mount Zion, and Solomon
took wood from each section of the triple trunk to make the two pillars, Fachin and Boaz,
which were placed at the entrance of the Temple. They were covered with bronze, and the
third section was inserted at the threshold of the chief gate. IT WAS A “TALISMAN”
WHICH HINDERED THINGS UNCLEAN FROM ENTERING WITHIN. But certain nefari­
ous Levites removed, during the night, the Talisman, which was an obstacle to their unholy
freedom and cast it, loaded with stones, at the bottom of the Temple reservoir. From this
time forward a Spirit troubled, the waters of the pool, imparting to them a miraculous
value, so that men might be distracted from seeking the tree of Solomon in its depths. In
the days of Jesus the pool was cleansed and the Jews, finding the beam of wood, which in
their eyes seemed useless, carried the latter outside the town and threw it across the brook
Cedron. It was over this bridge that Jesus, The Master, passed after his arrest at night in
the Garden of Olives. His executioners cast him from it into the water; and then in their
(Continued on Next! Page)

THE LESSER KEY OF SOLOMON
Goetia. The Book Of Evil Spirits
haste to prepare the instrument-in-chief of His passion, they took the beam with them,
which was made of three kinds of wood, and formed the cross therewith.
Whatever the date to which the Book of the Penitence of Adam may be referable, it
represents one form of a legend which was spread widely In the Middle Ages. The Gospel
of Nicodemus seems to have instituted the first analogy between The Tree Of Knowledge
and The Tree Of The Cross. “All ye who have died through the wood which this man”—
Adam—“hath touched: All of you I will make alive again by the wood of the cross.” The
legend of the triple branch, under a strartge transformation, reappears in that chronicle of
the Holy Graal which has been ascribed to the authorship of Walter Map. There is no end
to the stories which represent Jesus dying upon a tree which was a cutting from The Tree
Of Knowledge. This is how The Tree Of Knowledge becomes The Tree Of Life in Chris­
tian legend.
This allegory embodies all the great traditions of the Kabalah and the secret Christian
doctrine of St. John, which is now utterly unknown. It follows that Seth, Moses, David,
Solomon and Jesus obtained from the same Kabalistic Tree their royal sceptres and
pontifical crooks. We can understand in this manner why the Christ was adored in His
manger by the MAGI. Let us recur, however, to The Book of Enoch, as greater authority
attaches to it than can be attributed to an unknown manuscript; the former is cited in the
New Testament by the Apostle St. Jude. Tradition refers the invention of letter to Enoch,
and it is to him that we must therefore trace back the teachings embodied in the Sepher
Yetzirali, which is the elementary work of the Kabalah, its compiler—according to the
Rabbins—being the patriarch Abraham, as the heir of the secrets of Enoch and as the
father of initiation in Israel. Enoch would seem in this manner to be identical with the
Egyptian Hermes, Trismegistus, while the famous “Book Of Thoth,” written throughout
in hieroglyphics and numbers, would be that Occult Bible, anterior to “The Books Of
Moses” and full of mysteries, to which the initiated WILLIAM POSTEL alludes so fre­
quently throughout his works, under the title of the Genesis of Enoch.
Talismans, Charms And Seals
In consequence of the rapid sale of books treating upon the subjects of Magic, Black
Art, and Witchcraft, and the unprecedented demand for information and knowledge on these
subjects, we have at last been forced to publish THE LESSER KEY OF SOLOMON, GOETIA,
THE BOOK OF EVIL SPIRITS, as the very same is a most complete treatise on these
mysterious subjects which clearly explains how to make your own Talismans, and the
reason of the Talisman’s potentiality from an Occult point of view. It clearly shows what
is in a Talisman ami how it is associated with the Hidden Powers of Nature. It proves the
value of Charms and Talismans, and provides the easiest method of constructing them. It
expounds in a simple manjier the old system of the Ancients, also a philosophical demon­
stration of the true principles of Magic as it is used by Sorcerers and those who practice
Witchcraft and Black Art. Indeed, throughout, it is a Book of Ancient Mysteries, for in it
there are scores and scores of Magical Talismans, Pentacles, Charms, Figures and Diagrams,
as well as other illustrations, experiments of invisibility arid how they are performed.
Charms and Talismans are shown for favor, success, love, hidden and buried treasures, and
all similar things, used in the Magical operation of the Art Of The Holy Pentacles, and Dia­
grams; also' much more interesting matter as constituting this wonderful book.
To the student, and the one who wishes to learn how a curse can be placed upon
another, and, how Conjurations and Ceremonies are used to bring about certain mysterious
things, this book is without value, and you should be sure and get a copy before the edition
is exhausted, for the price asked is an insignificant one for a book of this kind. There are
few books which fully explain The Hidden Mysteries Of Talismans and Charms, and this
very same work will certainly be found quite a cyclopedia of Magic and its hidden meaning.
The knowledge gained from this book will prove most useful and save many persons much
time and trouble in trying to understand many mysterious things that are operated by
people around them. The time has passed when people are to remain ignorant of Magic
and The Black Art; for there are thousands in all parts of the world who know it and use
it daily. In order to protect yourself and understand these things, it would seem a very
foolish thing for you not to invest at least such a small amount as Two Dollars for a famous
book of this kind, which tells you so much for such a small amount of money. By the aid '
of this book you may acquire knowledge and mysterious secrets which will explain a great
deal of the phenomena which has puzzled you in the past. Knowledge of The Mysteries of
Magic is needed from the cradle to the grave, and all eminent authorities are today acquir­
ing it. For this reason, GOETIA, THE BOOK OF EVIL SPIRITS, is an indispensable work to
every student, for it contains several full pages of certain Secret Talismans. “THE LES­
SER KEY” will help you unlock the mysteries of the universe, and you may be able to get
from it the very Talisman or Charm you are seeking. In fact, it is “The Book of Magic,”
containing an analytical and critical account of Magical Rituals, Black Magic, The Rites
And Mysteries Of Goetia, Theurgy, Sorcery And Infernal Necromancy.
Here is a book by which you will be able to determine the connection between Cere­
monial Magic and the Secret Tradition in Christian times; showing the distinction between
White And Black Magic as well. In fact, it is the Alpha and the Omega of Talismanic
Magic, for it brings the student face to face with Pentagrams, Magical Equilibrium, as
well as The Fiery Sword Of Realization and Initiation.
Remember that when you obtain this book, you gain possession of one of the most
extraordinary works ever published upon the Rites And Mysteries Of Goetia, Sorcery, and
Infernal Necromancy. It is a Volume full of mysteries and of marvels. It has been most
accurately translated from Ancient Manuscripts, containing the fullest practical, yet simple
instruction ever offered to the student. It is arranged in a manner so clear that it is
rendered suitable either to the most learned or the less advanced student of the Occult.
The price, as stated before, is insignificant for a book of this kind, and, owing to this fact,
it, without doubt, will have the greatest sale of any book published within the last fifty
years, (Continued on Next Page)

THE LESSER KEY OF SOLOMON
Goetia. The Book Of Evil Spirits
The Transcendental Knowledge And Ceremonial Magic, as a fact, is reserved for those
who desire to become Masters, for Virgin Nature does not deliver the Keys of her secret
chamber to those who seek them not with a sincere desire to learn. This is an age when
men desire to become Initiated into the Mysteries Of Nature. Men are born into the world
as slaves. This is to say, man is born in the bondage of his passion and ignorance, but
he can reach emancipation through intelligence. Between those Masters who are free, and
those who are as yet in the bondage of their passions and ignorance there is no equality
possible. The part of reason is to rule, and of instinct to obey. On the other hand, if you
will impose on the blind, the facts of .leading the blind, both will end in the abyss of
ignorance.
Society to-day is no abstract personality that can be rendered responsible separately
for the ignorance of man; society is the association of men and women; it is defective by
reason of their vices and sublime in respect of their virtues; but in itself, it is purely
spiritual, like the unseen power which is bound up inseparably therewith. Is not true
Spiritualism and real Occultism, as a fact, an association of the highest spiritual aspira­
tions and the most generous endeavors. After this manner does the blasphemy of anti­
social equality and of right in the teeth of duty give answer to the lie about castes privi­
leged by Nature; Occultism alone has solved the problem by/ assigning supremacy to self-
sacrifice and by proclaiming him as the greatest who offers up his life for his fellow-men
and truth.
Once more we will speak aloud regarding THE LESSER KEY OF SOLOMON, GOETIA,
THE BOOK OF EVIL SPIRITS, for it is one of the most marvelous depositaries of the tra­
dition of the Ancients, who preserved in all of its purity, Ceremonial And Talismanic Magic.
The glory of Ancient) Magic is that it called all men to truth wthout distinction of castes,
though not without distinction in respect of sincerity of soul.
“Cast not your pearls before swine,” said the Divine JESUS, Founder of Christianity,
4<lest) treading them under foot, they turn and rend you.” THE BOOK OF SOLOMON com­
prises all the Kabalistic Secrets concerning the Doctrine of the Master Jesus, and are books
that in the past have been rare and hard to obtain. “Let him understand who- has knowl­
edge-—let him who understands compute”—says ST. JOHN quietly after reciting an allegory
or giving a Mystic Seal. ST. JOHN, the beloved Disciple and depositary of all the Occult
Secrets of Jesus, did not therefore write to be understood by the multitude. The book now
being written of, herewith, and herein, summarizes and completes all the science of ABRA­
HAM and of SOLOMON, as it will prove by understanding the “Keys” of The Transcendent
Kabalah.
The Science Of Equilibrium is the “Key” of Occult Science. Men and women with
uncontrolled and unbalanced mental and spiritual forces, perish in the void. So has passed
from this world many anxious men and women as well as princes and giants. They have
fallen like trees; without roots, and their place is found no more. Through the conflict of
unbalanced mental, spiritual and Occult forces, men and women will continue to become
devastated and void and powerless, until they, by their own efforts, succeed in penetrating
The Mysteries Of Magic sufficiently to control their unbalanced forces. All the aspirations
of the Master Adepts are directed towards unity of form, towards the living synthesis of
equilibrated Occult forces. The face of the Master, crowned with Astral Light, rose over
the vast sea of unbalanced forces and was reflected as a vision in the light thereof. Let
those who have allowed their eye to follow these lines with interest, penetrate further into
the great Mysteries of Nature and the Science of Talismanic Magic and they will be
rewarded according to their efforts. This printed matter has been sent unto you in the
sublime faith and belief that once you have in your possession a copy of this marvelous
book, that you will be benefited and helped beyond measure, for it has been sent in no
other spirit.
As has been stated several times herein, the price is nothing compared to the book you
will receive, for it was first necessary to obtain permission to enter the great library of the
British Museum, at London, England, and put in many months .of hard work in translating
from Ancient and musty Manuscripts THE LESSER KEY OF SOLOMON, known as “GOE­
TIA,” THE BOOK OF EVIL SPIRITS. This has cost thousands of dollars and we are
pleased that we can now announce that this book can be obtained at a mere trifle.

TALISMANS
THEIR EFFICIENCY AND HIDDEN POWERS
The modern student of Occultism and Talismanic Magic knows, without doubt, that
Charms and Talismans do possess a wonderful Hidden Power, and exert an unseen influence
over many’things. To-day these self-same students are learning to construct and fashion
their own Talismans, Seals Of Spirits, Magical Squares and Pentacles. For their construc­
tion, it is only necessary to study such famous books as “THE GREATER KEY OF SOLO­
MON THE KING,” and “RAPHAEL’S ANCIENT MANUSCRIPT OF TALISMANIC MAGIC,”
commonly known as THE BOOK OF RECONDITE WISDOM.
Talismans And Pentacles are made and worn to-day upon the breast, suspended and
enclosed in a Leather Talisman Case,. No one should touch or see the Talisman or Charm
after placement, except the person for whom it is designed, and only when it has wrought
its effect should it be discarded. This method is adopted by natives of India and Africa.
A number of Talismans may be worn at the same time.
A good price is paid to-day in Europe and throughout the Orient for a Talisman made
by one of the Old Master Adepts of the Middle Ages. However, those who obtain
“RAPHAEL’S ANCIENT MANUSCRIPT OF TALISMANIC MAGIC” will be able to make an
exact reproduction of the old world famous Charms, Talismans, Magical Squares and
Pentacles both of the Hindu and Jewish Kabala. In other words, all of the noted Charms,
and famous Talismans in the world have been collected and reproduced in “RAPHAEL’S
ANCIENT MANUSCRIPT” as well as “THE GREATER KEY OF SOLOMON THE KING.”

de Laurence at an enormous expense of time and money. An actual reproduction of the
original hand writing of Raphael. Raphael himself, sat down and wrote out the instruc­
tions, drew all of the Diagrams and Talismans. It is not printed like the ordinary book.
When you open it you are confronted with Rare and Valuable Instruction and Secret
Information regarding the Construction of Talismans of every kind, and for every
known purpose. Everything has bco® written down plain by Raphael. Shows how to
construct Charms against Evil Spirits, Talismans for the Fruits of the Earth, Talisman

Hand by one of the Greatest Masters that ever lived. The author’s reputation has lived on
and on, and this wonderful book comes down to us through the ages, as a GREAT GIFT AND
BLESSING. If it was sold for its actual value to those interested in Talismans the charge
would be $100.00 a copy, as it contains nearly three'score Talismans, Seals, Pentacles, and
Charms for every known purpose, including Talismans for locating Hidden Treasures, the
gaining of Wealth, Love, etc.
THE SUBJECT OF SEALS AND TALISMANS IS OF GENUINE HUMAN INTEREST.
There is no doubt that the great majority of the human race have believed in the virtues of
Talismans and Amulets, and by a strange recurdescence of Ancient Magis in our own time
many people have taken to the idea cf carrying a Charm or a Talisman to overcome evil
influences and enemies as well as to bring them success and good fortune.
Famous Book Of Recondite Wisdom
Before de Laurence obtained this Ancient Manuscript it was impossible to buy a copy
of this book at any price. He paid an immense amount of money for the Original Manu­
script, written down by Raphael’s own hand, the very same being about Two Hundred
Years Old, and had it published in book form under the title of, “RAPHAEL’S ANCIENT
MANUSCRIPT OF TALISMANIC MAGIC.” Teaches everything, known about Pre-historic
Talismans, beginning- with and ranging down through the ages of all EGYPTIAN TALIS­
MANS, CHINESE TALISMANS, JAPANESE TALISMANS, HINDU, AND THIBETAN TAL-
IMANS, EXTRUSCAN TALISMANS, GREEK, AND ROMAN TALISMANS as they were
known to early Christian and Mediaeval Civilizations, de Laurence performed a worthy
deed when he published this Ancient Manuscript in book form and ordered it sold for ONLY

THE PHILOSOPHY OF NATURAL MAGIC
Thousands Of Dollars Made By The Use Of Secret Knowledge
Several years ago a gentleman and his wife walked into Burrow Brothers
Large Bookstore on Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio, and asked to be directed
to the Section of Rare Old Occult and Spiritual Books. The gentleman, after
looking through the books in that particular Section, purchased one which
treated upon Occultism and Magic, and paid $10.00 for it. His wife, who did
not at that time believe in either Occultism or Spiritualism, "bawled” him out
and told him he was very foolish to buy books of that kind as he was only throw­
ing his money away. Today this man is worth thousands of dollars, and HE
MADE EVERY DOLLAR OF IT THROUGH THE USE OF THE SECRET
KNOWLEDGE HE OBTAINED FROM THAT RARE OLD OCCULT BOOK
HE BOUGHT. His wife later realized her mistake and is now as much inter­
ested in books treating upon the subject of Spiritualism, Occultism and Natural
Magic as her husband is.
Of course, every one who reads this will be curious to know the name of the
Occult Book which this man bought in Cleveland. It was "THE PHILOSOPHY
OF NATURAL MAGIC,” by Henry Cornelius Agrippa. The very same being
a complete work on NATURAL MAGIC; WHITE MAGIC; BLACK MAGIC;
DIVINATION; OCCULT BINDING; SORCERIES, AND THEIR POWER;
UNCTIONS; LOVE MEDICINES AND THEIR VIRTUES; THE OCCULT
VIRTUE OF THINGS WHICH ARE IN THEM ONLY IN THEIR LIFE TIME,
AND SUCH AS REMAIN IN THEM EVEN AFTER THEIR DEATH; THE
OCCULT OR MAGICAL VIRTUE OF ALL THINGS, ETC.
All this may seem incredible, but Io “hear ye, hear ye,” souls of the earth and but
study this wonderful Book of Revelations and thou shall see with thine own eyes
the possibility confirmed and proven both by reason and example.
This work is even superior to the teachings of either the Wise Men, or the
Egyptian School of Magic for the reason that it teaches a Venerable, True and
Sublime Occult Philosophy, so you can understand the mysterious influence of the
intellectual world upon the celestial, and of both upon the terrestrial; and to know
how to dispose and fit yourself so as to be capable of receiving the superior Occult
and Astral operations of these worlds, whereby you may be enabled to operate won­
derful secret things by a natural power. ——,
This remarkable book from the hand of its Venerable author is without doubt
the most wonderful work presented to the student for many years. A system of
Occult Philosophy, which for centuries was Lost, has again been brought forth to
instruct the student. . ■—1
It is impossible in a small page like this to adequately and justly review this
Great Lineal Occult Key. We shall therefore merely touch the high places or beacon
lights, which stand out so prominently, and are taught so plain and fearlessly that
they instinctively arrest the attention of the reader. The author was, during his earth
life, a man of marvelous Occult power, great intelligence, fearless in his utterances,
because absolute master of the subjects which he taught, and we are frank to acknowl­
edge his deductions are to us unassailable and unanswerable, yet, notwithstanding
the high moral status, scientific value, and perfect diction, an air of great Occult
Powers pervades every page.
The author, a “Master” and member of a great Occult Brotherhood, which he
designates “The Venerable Brotherhood of Magic,” which concisely defined in its
broadest and most comprehensive meaning of term Magic—includes knowledge of
things Occult, Spiritual, Magical and Esoteric. It embodies knowledge of the laws,
principles, forces, activities and processes which operate within the Astral World, as
well as in the great world of spirits. It is the book of books, and is without limita­
tions other than those which mark the ever widening boundaries of increasing spirit­
ual knowledge.
There are Seventy-Four Chapters in the book, each Chapter complete in itself, yet
so dovetailed into each other that they form a complete whole.
The First and Second Chapters are devoted to Natural Magic.
Chapters three and four are without doubt the most marvelously interesting
instructions from an Occult standpoint ever written, and no intelligent Occult student
can afford to pass this book unread.
It is Divine and Moral, overstepping and overtopping without apparent effort
every and all publications heretofore ever written on this great subject. It demon-
(Continued on Next Page)
’THE PHILOSOPHY
OF NATURAL MAGIC
trates without a scintilla of doubt that present-day teachings by professors and mediums are
jut the shadow of the ancient work in its conception of true Occultism and Natural Magic.
The author is a member of this ancient and “Venerable Brotherhood of Adepts,” of which
present-day spiritism is but an offshoot. This Brotherhood is an entity and is composed of
men who voluntarily associate together for the acquirement and perpetuation of knowledge
in the broad and unlimited field of Natural Magic. Members of this Venerable Brotherhood
of Adepts are scattered over the Orient and Asia, wherever the conditions for the success
of their efforts appear to them most favorable, and their students are among the most unob­
trusive intelligences in their several communities through the far East.
Their work is carried on very largely in The Temples of the East and on the Astral
Plain. The Lineage and History of this great Brotherhood cover a consecutive and unbroken
chain, backward from the immediate present to a time many thousands of years before the
Christian period, and the principle for which it stands goes back to the very infancy of the
human race.
History shows that the oldest and most authentic history of the world is in the possession
and keeping of the Venerable Adepts.
This Work tells how the Great Lineal Occult Key was lost, and how it car. be regained
by the earnest seeker today if he or she will but “live the life.”
Chapters nine, nineteen and twenty give more real instruction than any and all other books
on this subject written by surface authors.
This Great Lineal Occult Key is truly grand in its instruction and will be a revelation
to students.
Nothing ever published compares with it in plainness of expression for the reason that
The Temple of these great “Venerable Masters of Natural Magic” was white and hoary with
age when the foundations of the pyramids were laid.
The Masters here and on the Astral Plain are not seeking to become popular in any
sense. ,
They have the courage to live in obscurity without material offices, honors or salary,
that they can the more consistently carry out the great Occult work of their life.
They do not seek the applause of the world, nor strive for leadership. They are neither
boastful nor arrogant. Never dogmatic, never arbitrary; never allow themselves to be drawn
into public debates—they accept poverty and adversity with serenity and cheerfulness and
pursue their purposes with an abiding sense of their personal responsibility.
The passages on several pages of this wonderful book are a fine tribute by the author,
to his own Venerable Brothers and other members of the Spiritual Brotherhood to which he
belonged and from which he received his teachings and training as a Great Mystic.
The Revelations in this work'are so inconceivable to the ordinary man or woman, so
incomprehensible to the ordinary finite mind, that were it not for the absolute sincerity,
humility and modesty evident on every page of the book, your credulity would be severely
taxed.
However, the author is one whose vision has been clear, and to whom the other shore
of life has been distinctly visible.
He has been able to penetrate the darkness of physical obscurity and behold with perfect
vision the spiritual world shining clear and strong beyond the dark and troubled waters of
earth life.
Here is one author which really teaches how to project the Astral body at will so that
you are able to make this visual transit at any time voluntarily and without the aid and co-op­
eration of any other individual human intelligence, incarnate or excarnate.
It teaches development so that you are able to converse with the inhabitants of the spir­
itual world as freely and as naturally as you can with those of the physical-world.
It teaches the magnetic field, or the great Occult Virtues infused in Talismans and Charms.
The tribute of honor and respect paid to the author of this work by the translator is
the finest we have ever read.
Those who are fortunate enough to obtain a copy, of this Great Lineal Occult Key, will
ever open and close its pages with a prayer of thankfulness, as its value is beyond compare.
To appreciate the teachings contained in this Volume requires a personal perusal and
conscientious study. Read the following testimonial:
L. W. de Laurence, My Dear Sir and Brother: I have studied with great pleasure
“The Great Lineal Occult Key,” ordered from you and desire to say that there is upon nearly
every page lessons which must appeal with great force to every true lover of the principles
of Natural Magic—and I wish it was today in the hands of every true brother and sister of
this study. It is a truly great book.
Ever your true disciple.
(Signed) A Brother Mystic
Now, dear reader, you have been sent this Catalog because you may be one who loves
Occultism and its exoteric teachings. One, too, who is seeking “further light,” and one, too,
(Continued on next page)
THE PHILOSOPHY 1
OF NATURAL MAGIC
who believes there is something grander and nobler in Natural Magic than yet brought forth
in the teachings of so-called authors as exemplified today.
This wonderful book teaches, the meaning of much that has hitherto been hidden.
The Venerable Brotherhood (one of whose Masters is the author of this Great Lineal
Occult Key) is the parent of ancient Occultism, which, unknov.r to many, carries within its
symbolism the wisdom and teachings of all the Ages' that are past.
The Philosophy of Natural Magic, by Henry Cornelius Agrippa, is really The Great
Occult Key, far surpasses any work heretofore published, in that its statements are absolute
facts that each and every student can demonstrate for himself if he has but the intelligence
to know, the courage to dare and the perseverance to do.
The Philosophy of Natural Magic as taught in this book marks the dawning of a new
day in Magic and Occultism, and each and every student of the work will feel and know that
if he so wills he may be the inheritor of the Ancient wisdom of all the Ages.
My reason for sending you this circular and letter, which gives a brief review of this
book, is my love of Natural Magic and desire to lift it above the sordid commercialism and
moral stagnation which, like an incubus, is weighting it down.
I have absolutely no pecuniary interest in the book whatever as it is now offered to you
at cost of publishing.
Many for years have been seeking the key that would unlock the “mysteries" which have
been hidden beneath the curse of materialism and ignorance.
Their prolonged and patient search will now have been rewarded by the discovery that
there is an ancient and Venerable Brotherhood, one of whose members is the author of this
book.
All will recognize'in this Volume the work of the “Master" by many signs and sym­
bols that are unmistakable.
This wonderful soul can, and, has given to the sincere student, in this book of all books,
The Great Lineal Occult Key, by which the Mysteries of Natural Magic, both White and
Black, are made plain.
That of a truth, you may, after due instruction be able to perform many strange and
wonderful things.
All this and much more is set forth in this book, which, if you love True Magic, revere its
teachings, are proud of its ancient Lineage, you will study and understand.
This work will appeal to you because of its value to students and especially to those
who are not dulled beyond the power of thought by the “damnable reiteration” of mere words.
As it is, outside of The Temples of the Brotherhood, the whole tract of so-called instruc­
tions by surface writers is an almost barren waste.
The esoteric books oftenest read, or at least those most often sold, are mere rehashes
of stupid commonplace teachings.
They give to the earnest student no new outlook upon life, no broader conception of the
soul, no “light" upon its mysteries.
This Great Lineal Occult Key comes as a promise of a better life for those who seek
the Wisdom it contains.
It dignifies True Magic and justifies its being. It gives a profound meaning to the things
concealed which, but for such commentary, are lost in the words of rote.
That “further light” which we seek upon the ultimate problem of existence is, after all,
within human reach, if one will but follow the path.
In my opinion you can do no greater service to yourself than to place your order for
this book at the lozv price asked.
“This Wonderful Book has special instruction to, and profound significance for, every
earnest and intelligent seeking soul.”
For lucidity of statement; for intellectual grasp of the subject; for abundance of ma­
terial; and for sound coherence and logical sequence, it is without an equal.
The Author of this book was possessed of a mighty mind and has produced a work that
will go far in changing the minds of men.
Written on the plan of the loftiest morals, it covers the entire field of Natural Magic
inquiry and makes clear a mass of facts that hitherto have been veiled in doubt and mystery.
It has been known to travelers in the far East that the sages of India are far in advance
of all other races in the knowledge and development of Magical or Spiritual phenomena.
They have a Venerable Brotherhood which they claim absolutely proves immortality, and
this Brotherhood has been kept intact down through the ages.
The “Wise Men of the East” who journeyed to the manger in Bethlehem were members
of this Occult Brotherhood and the Master Jesus was but a reincarnation of one of heir for­
mer numbers.
The devotees of this Venerable Brotherhood are laboring to raise man to a, higher spiritual
unfoldment and may be found in all the advanced and progressive civilizations of the earth.
Their identity is kept a secret, and True Magic is the Occult Link that binds them together.
A wonderful book indeed is “The Philosophy of Natural Magic," by Agrippa.
(Continued on next page)
■ THE PHILOSOPHY
OF NATURAL MAGIC
It contains secret instruction that has coms down from the sages of India and the far
East, whose morals are as lofty as were ever taught by man.
By the practice of its formulary one can develop and contact with the souls of the Astral
Plain.
This book is now sold at cost of publication and you will do well to obtain a copy at
once as the Edition is limited.
After this Edition is sold the price will again be $5.00.
It is truly “A Great Lineal Occult Key,” its author writes clearly, calmly and with
superior intelligence.
It is a most remarkable work.
This book contains a special message to every earnest and intelligent soul. It gives the
real origin, meaning and intent of Natural Magic and its relations to the Wisdom of India
and ancient Magic. All instructions are plain and there can be no mistake in their significance.
To one whose spiritual knowledge goes no further than what he sees and hears in church,
this book will be startling, to say the least. It is pre-eminently a book for the student who
can bring to its perusal a clear brain and a mind free from prejudice and dogmatism.
It is a book that will have to be reckoned with. It is, in many respects the most remark­
able publication of the century. It is indeed, a Great -Book, intelligently, faithfully and nobly
done.
Instructions contained therein are unique, as nothing approaching it reduced to a scien­
tific Occult formula can elsewhere be found in literature. It is a book that is destined to
excite very wide interest, as it loosens the foundation of many beliefs and dogmas, and sets
before the world of science problems they cannot evade, and to which they have hitherto
offered no solution. The author writes clearly and his work is divested of all obscurity.
There need be no mistaking his meaning.
It is a remarkable book, and justifies its title. It is, in fact, a compendium of Natural
Philosophy. It is more than this, it is an up-to-date, practical and pertinent application of the
problems of moral and physical nature and brings them within the conception of Natural
law. In this respect also it is a Lineal Occult Key and valuable addition to the best Occult
books of the day.
The-author’s style is clear-cut, cogent and vigorous, handling every subject so the student
can understand it by stripping it of every obstruction to the Light of Truth. It is, in a word,
a strong, valuable book that will repay study and perusal, a» a glance over its Contents,
which follow, will show.

INDIA’S HOOD UNVEILED
Spirit Sight At Will, South India Mysteries
Hindu Levitation, Suspended Animation
Four Days In A Trance
Famous Hindu Hypnograph - In India It Is Called Huyvushi
BY A GENUINE HINDU—A NATIVE OF SOUTH INDIA.
Three Separate and Distinct Hindu Books,
now published in our Revised and Enlarged
Edition of “India’s Hood Unveiled,” with Spe­
cial Features as it was just recently obtained
from South India.
Th® Original Works or Manuscripts, as
first published at Madras, India, are now on
file in our offices; where they can be inspected
by any interested party, or any one who may
doubt that we have the original books that
were published at Madras, India.
Only a Very Few Copies of these three
famous Hindu Courses were in circulation at
Madras and South India, and the three com­
bined manuscripts sold for 35 India Rupees,
or 3 Pounds English money, which would be
about $15.00 in American money.
After Great Expense, we finally obtained
from South India a copy of each of the three
original manuscripts or books. After they
were imported, the next great expense was to
have these manuscripts set up and published in
English by American publishers.
“India’s Hood Unveiled,” as now published
by us, is an exact reproduction of those printed
in India, only our edition is printed on better
paper, being bound in dead black and silk, and
stamped in gold.
A Thousand Times has the earnest student desired original instruction, which
would give him in full the genuine Hindu rituals and ceremonies which are known
to be imbued and pregnant with the elementary as well as the Secret, Mystic and
advanced principles and teachings of those Astral Powers and Spirit Control which
lead on to the Higher degrees of Yoga-Astral, Sight-Clairvoyance-Levitation, Burial
Alive, etc.
HINDU LEVITATION.
Hindu Levitation—Raising the body in the air without any material means of
support, has never been accomplished, only by those who understood this super­
human feat.
All Cases of Levitation which have been shown on the European and American
stage are pure fake; being accomplished by using piano wire, the same being invisible
against the stage back-ground, which, of course, is so arranged as to make the wires
and other apparatus used in this farce, invisible from off the stage.
Throwing the hoop around the body, to show that no strings or wires are attached
to it, is an old Yankee trick, for the wires are there all the same. The Hindu uses
only Astral Forces to raise a person and suspend them in the air.
The Hindu Sages were the discoverers of those mighty Astral and Occult Forces,
which are even now being practiced by many a Yogi and Hindu Fakeree throughout
Ancient India.
The Yogi’s ability and display of skill conveys startling proof that they have
held in sacred trust a true and full knowledge of those Astral and Spirit Powers
which other men have lost.
“India’s Hood Unveiled—Hindu Occult Mysteries Revealed.” Also contains ar
advanced course which teaches Hindu Magnetism, Hindu Hypnotism, Hindu Mesmer­
ism, Hindu Suggestive Therapeutics, Hindu Psychic-Therapeutics, Hindu Mind Read­
ing, Hindu Telepathy, Hindu Magnetic Healing, Hindu Development of the Will,
Hindu Clairvoyance, etc.
Book 1 is separated into 7 different parts and contains 38 lessons.
Book 2 is separated in 2 parts and contains 7 chapters.
Book 3 contains about 40 lessons.
All These Books are now published and bound in One Volume.

A SPECIAL Feature is the Hindu “ Hypnograph,” which
you are to use to gain Occult and Astral Powers, and at
the same time to bring to you healthy, natural forces, which will give
you a super-abundance of healthy, vital fluid, which will ward off bad
influences and sickness.
The Hypnograph, which in India is called HUYVUSHI, is
always used by the Hindu when developing; and it, together with full
instructions for its use, has never before been introduced among western
students in Europe and America.
“India’s Hood Unveiled” contains full and complete instruction
for using the HINDU HUYVUSHI, or Hypnograph, which is very
useful to open spiritual avenues to man, and greatly appreciated by all
Hindu Adepts, the same being of supreme worth to all students. A
HUYVUSHI will be sent free with every copy of this book.

DE LAURENCE’S BOOKS HAVE MADE THIS MAN A FINANCIAL SUCCESS.
The de Laurence Co., Chicago, III.
Deab Friends:— Butte, Montana, Aug. SO, 19IS.
A few months ago I received your book entitled, “India’s Hood Unveiled,” by a native
of South India. After reading this book three times, I can truthfully state that it is the
best work on the subject that I have ever read, and that it has made me an Occult Master
of the art of Hypnotism. The Price, only$2.00, is cheap. I also have de Laurence’s famous
work, “The Great Book Of Magical Art, Hindu Magic, And East Indian Occultism,” as
well as his “Book Of Death, Soul Transition, And Hindu Spiritism,” and I will here state
that they are all and more than de Laurance claims them to be, and that no one could buy
them from me at any price, neither would I exchange them for their weight in gold, if I
could not get other copies of these wonderful books. As “The Book Of Magical Art,
Hindu Magic, And East Indian Occultism” is a large volume, weighing seven pounds, its
weight in gold would be an immense sum, but even this would not tempt me to part with
my book if I could not procure another.
Further, de Laurence’s books have made me a financial success, and I want to thank
him for it, and I also want every student to know of my wonderful success financially.
Financial success is what most people call real success, but by the study of de Laurence’s
works, I have had other successes that are more valuable to me than any financial success
would be. For five years I was connected with one of the. leading Hospitals of St. Louis,
and am in a position to give a fair estimation and express valuable views upon the above
matters, and it is because I have been so greatly benefited that I desire to express myself
as above. Yours very truly, The above testimonial is on fils in this office,

ONE OF DE LAURENCE’S STUDENTS
WHO ORDERED AND STUDIED

The de Laurence Co. Central America, Oct. 7, 1916.
I am sending you herewith a program from the Varieties Theatre in Bluefields,
Nicaragua, Central America, where I am now giving an exhibition of Hypnotism and
The Hindoo "Samahdi” or The State Of Hindoo Trance And Suspended Animation, and
as you will see, from the Theatre Program, I am buried alive four days while in this state.
The wonderful power to perform these things I obtained by reading your famous book
known as “INDIA’S HOOD UNVEILED, SOUTH INDIA MYSTERIES,” Order No.
25, catalogue list, which teaches “Samahdi” or how to place yourself in a state where
animation is so completely suspended that you can be buried in this state, and, after a num­
ber of days be resurrected from the grave. I desire to inform you that I have no trouble
in placing myself in this Trance and then be buried in the earth.
It is my earnest request that you kindly, if possible, mention this great feat which is
now being performed by one of your students. As stated above, I have learned this won­
derful work from the book, “INDIA’S HOOD UNVEILED” and I have the satisfaction
of having most ably performed these wonderful f*ats in ef the bast theatres in the
different parts of the world.
In closing, I most earnestly again request that you publish thi, letter, and the program
if you will, as I wish other students to know of my success. I cannot express myself to
you nor find words to thank you for your great books and the assistance that you have
given me which has enabled me to appear on the public stage in the above capacity. Any
person who orders and studies the book, “INDIA’S HOOD UNVEILED” or your
“GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC, AND EAST INDIAN OC­
CULTISM” can become famous if they follow out the teachings taught therein. Sincerely
yours, Prof. W. J. Kerr.

Shows Hundreds Of Lines, Mounts And Marks In The Hand
A STANDARD WORK ENCYCLOPEDIC IN EXTENT
“Keiro’s Palmistry, Clairvoyance and Psy-cho-met-ry,” combined with Sub­
Sections from Ed. Heron-Allen’s “Practical Hand-Book of Cheir-os-ophy” and M. Be
Capitaine C. S. D’Arpentigny’s Famous French Manual, the “Science of the Hand.”
Published under the editorship of de Laurence.
This work contains over one hundred rich
half-tone colored illustrations and zinc etchings
prepared at an immense expenditure of time,
labor and money, to produce the very best up-
to-date work ever published for the student and
professional reader of Palms. Self-education
on this subject is good education.
Whether you order this book or not it will
be to your advantage to always remember that
“The hand of another keeps constantly before
you proof and evidence of his true nature, spe­
cial adaptations and real characteristics.”
Let it be remembered, by all who read here
that—
“It is the human hand that weaves and
makes the garments which protect us from heat
and cold in summer, and in winter. That it is
the human hand of man which constructs the
nets, traps and snares with which we subjugate
the brute and animal creation. With the hu­
man hand do we not fashion and create all the
implements of art, science and war, as well as
the altars and shrines of worship; and, lastly,
by means of the hand, the author bequeaths
to posterity in writing the intellectual trea­
sures of his own soul, and mind; and hence we
who are living in this age are enabled to see
before our eyes the immortal writings and teachings of such great souls and masters
as Plato, Aristotle, Paracelsus, Eliphas Levi and all the venerable sages of antiquity.
If you wish to know the past life or future possibilities of an individual, look
for his history or future where you will find true evidence, that is, in the hand. We
have no desire to give undue prominence to the subject. However, we shall cer­
tainly state the true facts as we know them and as the science of Palmistry and
Cheiromancy will bear us out. To wit—Have you not, at some time or another in
your life, experienced that feeling of confidence and good fellowship expressed, and
felt, by a good, honest, firm grasp of youi’ hand when you have been shaking hands
with some one? Have you not, at some time or another in your life, experienced that
feeling of repulsion and discomfort which comes over one when you shake the hand
of an individual whose hand feels cold, distrustful, deceitful and corpse like.
This book will be a companion to you today, a helpmate tomorrow, and an
official guide for you five, or twenty-five years from today.
You can make no better, or wiser investment, as this manual, which is richly
and lavishly illustrated with handsome colored half-tone plates, charts and maps
of the human hand, covers each and every phase of the science and art of “Palmis­
try," “The Psychonomy of the Human Hand,” “The Cheiromancy,” “Cheirognomy,”
“Cheirosophy,” “Clairvoyance,” and “Psychometry.” Finest silk bindings, gold

ANCIENT BIOGRAPHIA, OF ALBERTUS MAGNUS
K Albertus Magnus was one of the most extraordinary persons that ever appeared in the
world.
U One of the most famous Philosophers, Physicians, Astrologers, and Mathematicians of his
time and the First restorer of true Philosophy and Magic as well as one of the most famous
doctors of the XVIIIth Century.
V Albertus Magnus, Prince of Philosophers, a Dominican, a Bishop of Ratisbon, was born
at Lawingen, on the Danube, in Suabia, in the year 1193. Moreri’s Dictionary gives us an
account of him as a famous Magician, and that he formed a machine in the shape of a man,
which served him for an Oracle and explained all the difficulties which he proposed to it.
One can easily be induced to believe that, as this famous man understood the Mathe­
matics, etc., he made a head, which by the aid of astral spirits, which he invoiced, could make
certain articulate sounds.
,1[ It is said that the Holy Virgin appeared, in Astral. Form, and asked him in which hd
would choose to excel, in Philosophy or Divinity; that he made choice of Philosophy, and
that the Holy Virgin told him he should surpass all men of his time in that Science.
If After this apparition appeared he showed a prodigious deal of knowledge of Philosophy
and Magic, and so improved in all these sciences that he quickly surpassed his preceptors.
If This learned man died in the year of Our Redemption, 1280, at Cologne, his body was
laid in the middle quire of the Convent of the Dominicans and his entrails were carried to
Ratisbon; his body was yet entire in the time of Emperor Charles V. and was taken up by
his command and afterwards replaced in its first Monument.
If He wrote a vast number of Books, amounting to twenty-one volumes, in folio, in the
Edition of Lyons, 1651, and the Student will do well to obtain the three volumes now trans­
lated from the German.
By the Author, Albertus Magnus, Concerning Volume One.
If To the Kind Reader: I herewith commit to the perusal of the reader a collection of
approved remedies—sympathetic as well as natural—remedies, sufficient in number as may be
deemed needful for household purposes.

ALBERTUS MAGNUS-EGYPTIAN SECRETS
White And Black Art For Man And Beast
If Knowing, from experience, how many an honest citizen hath been robbed of his entire
estate through the machinations of bad and malicious people, having his live stock destroyed
and the usefulness of his cows tampered with; and still further, how many a man hath been
tortured and tantalized at night, from early childhood, by wicked people of that ilk; so much
so that they could hardly bear it any longer, had it not been for the timely aid rendered them
by exercising these rabbles, if this be even done by calling upon the Bedgoblin or “Puck.”
1 Moreover, many such troubled people were made unhappy in their wedlock, and robbed of
all their children. Besides all this I know of a place, of which the minister of the Gospel
who officiates there assures me, that the influence of but one wicked female residing there
has caused the ruin of the entire village, since there is hardly man or beast existing in the
place which had not been tampered with and attacked by that wicked person.
H But, through the grace of God, every one of these people have been rescued by the means
of the Bedgoblin, as set forth in the second article of this book.
1 Whenever said remedy is to be applied, in case the name of him whom it is intended
to assist is called aloud three times with devotion, and by adding both his Christian and all
his other names, the usefulness thereof will be readily enough perceived, the matrimonial
peace will be re-established, the children will recover, the cows will again become useful,
no matter how much reduced in body they have been; but a few weeks will elapse, and the
cows will show as much sound flesh as they ever possessed theretofore.
If Thus it happens that this collection contains a number of curious performances of magic,
every one of which is worth far more than the reader pays for this entire book.
If For the purpose of rendering a great service to mankind, this book was issued, in order
to bridle and check the doings of the Devil and Evil Spirits.
If Whatever objections may be raised against this book by disbelief and jealousy, these pages
will, despite all such objections, contain naught else but truth divine, since Christ himself
hath commanded that all
Holy Spirit, so that the
his will; and it will thus
lost his fortune and his
and the blessings of the _
the power from the Devil, and afterwards became wealthier than he ever was before.
1f Thus we also must act; that is, bless our possessions, our homes, and entrust them to the
care of the Lord, and doubtless the Devil will have to retire and succumb.
If I, therefore, beseech every one, into whose hands this book may come, not to treat the ■
same lightly or to destroy the same, because, by such action, he will defy the will of God.
and God will, in return therefor, destroy him, and cause him to suffer eternal punishment
and grim damnation.
1f But to him who properly esteems and values this book, and never abuses its teachings, will
not only be granted the usefulness of its contents, but he will also attain everlasting joy
and blessing.
If And now, I submit this book to you, dear reader, for your best use and profit, in the name
of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen! Yea, even so be it.

By the Author, Albertus Magnus, Concerning Volume Two.
U To the Header: The recipes noted in this book have been successfuly applied, used, and
approved of, by an experienced man for many years, and have been found to be very appro­
priate remedies; and hence they may be recommended to every one who will use them with
care, provided such person has the true belief.
11 These important remedies would have still remained unpublished, had it not been for the
fact that the proprietor of the same had the inclination to assist an unfortunate family with
the result of this publication, and thus it happened that they were printed, and that perishing
family derived the benefit from the sale of this book by obtaining a livelihood, and the public
are also benefited thereby.
U Inasmuch as, at this juncture, all looks so gloomy in society, the writer of this expects
that no pirate of books will wrongfully seize this work and reprint the same, if such an one
does not wish to incur the eternal curse, and even condemnation from such an act.
If While we recommend it to the protection of God and the Holy Trinity, that they may be
watching the same, and set the Angel Michael as watch and guard over the undertaking, so
that no pirate may rob the real and legal owner of the means of deriving his daily bread
from the sale of this publication, and cheat him of his property by the peril of losing his
blessedness, such a being would never find rest nor quiet, by day or night, neither here below
nor in the hereafter, by seeking to defraud the publisher of his own.
H This would God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit grant.

By the Author, Albertus Magnus, Concerning Volume Three.
If The wonderful cures that have been effected by me at home and abroad, on man and beast,
have caused and induced many persons to express their desire to have some of my remedies,
which have proved so efficient, published.
If My intention, however, was not to have a great deal of my treatment of human ailments
and diseases put into print, so as not subject myself to the critic and censure of the learned.
If For such reasons I have published in this volume but few domestic medicines for mankind,
and given more space and attention to the treatment of dumb animals.
If Far the cure of cattle, sheep, and hogs especially, though for horses, there will be found
in this book quite a number of treatments for all sorts of diseases and injuries, whatever
they may be called; also the manner of treatment of animals, when they are well, and how to
prevent many injuries.
If All medicines mentioned herein have been tried and proved by me, personally, during a
practice of many years and have ever been found efficacious.
If My heartfelt wish therefore is, that this book may prove to the reader a source of great
value, and a recommendation to the author.

THE ARCH ADEPT
Of The First Degree
The Occult Mystery Of Cloomber, India
The Hindu Astral Bell In The
Thul Valley, At Terada Pass, India
Editorship Of de Laurence
Shows that the Adepts of India communicate
with each other by Thought-Transference. Those
who are initiated can communicate at a great dis­
tance as though they were together in a Temple.
In fact their retreats in the Himalayas, which seem
so lonely and dreary to the outsider, are in reality
points of great mental activity and thought, or
mental currents, for the interchange of personal
views among the Adepts. When these great Masters
of Occultism and esoteric powers wish to attract or
signal each other they have the Occult power of
sounding their Astral Bell.
Shows that the Hindu Adepts of Northern India
do not always use their Astral Bell exclusively for
the purpose of a signal or as a means of communi­
cation; but that by it they are always enabled to
exert a terrible Occult power over any individual so
as to know at all times just where he is and what he
is doing, so they can get him at any time.
A World of Miracle and Weird Enchantment
This work goes deep—deep down into the very
bottom and depths of the Esoteric system of East­
ern Adeptship as it really and truly exists in the
north of India and, in Thibet, among the Secret
Occult Orders and Brotherhoods of those East In­
dian Occultists of which so little is known, only
to those who have lived and dwelt among these
Adepts who form the most powerful and important
Secret Society—a Society which is girt around with
such physical terrors, so much bodily privations and
discipline that very few have the courage to pre-
severe until they reach an advanced degree of de­
velopment and attain full Initation.
If you are interested in knowing how a Curse
or an Evil Spell is placed on a person order this
book. It is an account of East Indian Occultism
among the Hindu Adepts of Northern India; which is astounding and strange. Few
realize how these Adepts have for ages devoted themselves to the study of Astral Laws
and Forces for placing an Evil Spell or Curse over anyone who crosses or harms them.
These Adepts are able to obtain results in connection with these forces which are abso­
lutely bewildering in their possibilities if suddenly introduced to the orthodox and prosaic
intelligence of the western scientist, who feels once he comes in contact with these pheno­
mena that he is in a world of miracle and weird enchantment. The reader will find in
this work an explanation of the direct cause of the many cases of Obsession, Demonology,
Insanity, Witchcraft, and other Mental and Nervous Troubles so common in Europe and
America.
A terrible incident, based upon known facts regarding the Great Mystery of placing
a Curse or an Evil Spell.
Once you begin to read its Occult Mysteries you will declare it one of the most Sig­
nificant Human Documents ever written regarding India, the Land of Mysteries. It tells
you what happens to any one who harms one of the Venerable Adepts of India. This book
shows that to do this thing is to commit a fatal act.
It tells the inside Mysteries of the Secret Occult Societies of India. An Occult Order
which is girt around with bodily privations and Occult Discipline that is merciless in its
power. Until you will have read this book, you will, never have any idea of what it is to
become a member of tho Brother Adepts of India. Tells you all about Obsession, Evil
Spirits, Demonology, and Witchcraft.,

MOSES THE PROPHET
MASTER OF EGYPTIAN MAGIC
Author Of The Sixth And Seventh Books Of Moses
THE TERRIBLE WAND OF MOSES
Royal Scepter Of Moses. Shepherd’s Staff Of Jacob
Moses was indebted for his knowledge to the mother of the Egyptian prin­
cess, Thermuthis, who saved him from the waters of the River Nile in Egypt.
The wife of Paraoh, Batria, was an Initiate herself of Egyptian Magic, and the
old Jews who formed the Bible, owe to her the possession of their Prophet Moses
who was "learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and mighty in words and
deeds.” Joseph also acquired a great knowledge of Egyptian Magic and Spirit­
ism from the high priests of Egypt.
Whatsoever Nature has constituted inferior to man is thereby to him made
subject: it is for man to extend his domain as taught In THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH
BOOKS OF MOSES, in virtue of continual ascent—all things do therefore obey the
Royal Scepter of those who understand Spirit Art, the shepherd's staff of Jacob and
the terrible Wand Of Moses.
Moses, by his Spirit Art, purified and re-veiled these secret things—this being
the sense of the word “Revealed.” The new disguise which Moses gave them was
that of the Holy Kabalah—that exclusive heritage of Israel and inviolable secret of
the Priests Of Magic.
Pharaoh’s Magicians accomplished at first the same miracles as Moses. The in­
strument which they used, and which is taught in “THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH
BOOKS OF MOSES,” was therefore the same as that used by Moses himself.
The inspiration alone differed; when they confessed themselves conquered, they
proclaimed that for them human powers had reached their limit and that there must
be something superhuman in Moses who was a master of Egyptian Magic as well as a
Clairvoyant who could read in the Astral Eight.
The Magicians Of Moses, being wonderful men, had all of the Grand Hierophants
of Egypt, and performed in virtue of their art wonders which were similar to those
of Moses. They transformed Wands into Serpents and Serpents again into Wands;
they changed Water into Blood; they produced a swarm of frogs in a moment.
Moses triumphed and led the Israelites out of the land of bondage. It was at
this period that true science became lost to Egypt, for the priests, abusing the implicit
confidence of the people, allowed the knowledge to degenerate into brutalizing idolatry.
Such is the rock of peril for Esoteric Science; The Truth Must Be Veiled, yet not
hidden from the people; symbolism must not be disgraced by a lapse into absurdity;
the Sacred Veil of Isis must be preserved in its beauty and dignity. It was over this
that the Egyptian priesthood failed; the vulgar and the foolish understood the
Hieroglyphic forms of Isis and Hermanubis as material instead of Spiritual Symbols.
Moses, however, did not wish the Sacred Hieroglyphics to pass out of memory,
and he sanctified them by their consecration to the purified worship of the true stu­
dent of Magic and Spirit Art, as shown and fully explained in his famous work, namely,
THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH BOOKS OF MOSES. (See next pages.)
The hidden forces of Nature can be made subject to the will of man. The Secrets
of controlling these forces, however, are reserved for the true student. The Crook
of the Priesthood shall become the Rod of Miracles; it was so in the time of Moses
and of Hermes; it will be so again for the student of Spirit Art.
THE FAMOUS SIXTH AND SEVENTH BOOKS OF MOSES, shown on next
page, were first written by Moses in Egypt:, that land of Magical Initiations, that land
where it was all Occult Science, Hierarchic and Sacred Instruction.

304 THE de LAURENCE COMPANY
BIG FORTUNE IS HIDDEN IN MOUNTAIN
Sees Visions Of Fabulous Wealth
Likes Sixth And Seventh Book Of Moses
- UnknoWft to all save one, interred securely from the greedy clutch of man somewhere
in NeveIf Sink Mountain, lies a Buried Treasure.
Of value beyond the wildest dreams of avarice, it dwarfs in comparison the fabled
Wealth of the Montezumas and the hidden loot of Captain Kidd.
At least that ’is the belief entertained by Reuben Kiebach. He bases his firm convic­
tions on revelations from the "SIXTH AND SEVENTH BOOK OF MOSES” and on "The
Prayer of Hope.”
The only thing necessary to locate this vast fortune is the muttering of the proper
INCANTATIONS from "THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH BOOKS OF MOSES” named above ac­
cording to Mr. Kiebach. A mere detail like that lies between him and opulence. He has
already decided What he will do with the gold when he uncovers it. He will invest some
in reliable securities and use the rest to endow his favorite charitable institution. Mr.
Kiebach is deeply religious and does not wish to acquire this fabulous sum for sordid
reasons
Advertises for Partner. Recently Mr. Kiebach inserted an advertisement in a news­
paper inquiring for a Magnetic Compass to assist him in unearthing] the riches. Mr. Kie-
bach has always been regarded as a very generous man.
A reporter for the Reading Eagle called at the Kiebach home, which is almost half
way up the slope of the Never Sink Mountain. Mr. Kiebach talked at length. Not a single
doubt exists in his mind of the treasure buried on the hill, and not very far from his home
at that.
The reporter, not wishing to convey the impression that he desired to commercialize
any information he might glean, began: "Mr. Kiebach, I believe.”
"That’s my name,” he responded.
"I understand that you want a Compass to assist you in digging up some money some­
where around here, and I thought I’d come up and find out about it. Is it true, and are
you the man?”
Mr, Kiebach did not seem at all uneasy or suspicious of his visitor, but answered: "I
put an add in the paper to that effect, if that’s what you mean.”
*Td like to know about it. Would you mind telling me why you need a compass; Why
you believe there is buried treasure, where it is and what you intend to do with it after
you find it?”
How He Became Interested, Mr. Kiebach, who is a medium sized, powerful chested,
blue eyed man of about 40, without making it necessary for the reporter to propound any
further questions, warmed immediately to his subject. His large blue eyes, flashing with
fervor and with his long arms gesticulating, he began: "I first became interested in the
location of buried treasure several years ago. I saw an advertisement in1 a paper. It was
placed by a Chicago firm that published very limited editions of books explaining how
hidden treasure can be revealed to a chosen few. I was one of the chosen. For a consider­
able sum of money I was able to secure these books. I studied them carefully. IN THESE
BOOKS ARE THE KEY TO INSTRUCTIONS. Fortunately I know the instructions. Un­
fortunately I do not possess the compass that will show the exact spot where the money
lies. Any man who owns such aj compass will know about where to place it. Its owner­
ship gives him that instinct.
Fortune in the Mountain. "I have always known, since reading the wonderful texts in
‘THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH BOOKS OF MOSES” and in repeating the prayer of hope
that somewhere on this mountain, and not far from my home, either, lies a fortune that if
found will make the finder the richest man in Reading. I am not a lazy man, but I think
it would be the height of folly to start excavating at random. You might labor until you
-fell dead in’ the pit, as Moses warns, without finding it.
Sneers Will Turn To Envy. "All this may sound very foolish to you. Newspapermen
.'get around quite a little, see a lot and get hardened. No doubt you are secretly scoffing at
me while I talk, but take it from me, your sneers will turn to envy wheii you come to me
to find out just what the sum was. Do you know that there is one man in this town, travel­
ing in the best society, regarded as one of our wealthiest citizens, and rightly. Do you
know how he became rich and independent? He knew the instruction. He followed the
instructions. Now he is rich. I will become rich the same way.
Who Found a Fortune? The reporter expressed ignorance of any man having acquired
his fortune in that manner, and inquired as to who it was.
"That is something I can’t tell you,” replied Mr. Kiebach earnestly. "Circumstances
beyond my control made it impossible for me to tell you. But it is a fact, and I could take
you to him. He uncovered more than $400,000 about 10 'years ago along the bank of the
Schuylkill River. No one ever found it out or even suspected the means of his sudden rise
to affluence.”
Must Valuable Treasure Ever Unearthed. Mr. Kiebach smiled vaguely and mysteriously.
He said: "That rests wholly in the hands of fate and of Moses. Whether it is gold or money
orj jewels, it will be very valuable, more valuable than any treasure ever unearthed.”
"HAVE YOU EVER TRIED OUT THOSE INCANTATIONS?” was the next question.
"I HAVE.”
"WITH WHAT SUCCESS?” presisted the reporter.
"WITH STARTLING SUCCESS,” RESPONDED THE MAN. "To test the secret instruc-
’J-ipns I tried them one day. There had been a big post office robbery in Schuylkill county.
Ihe P?'Pers were full of it. The place had been cleaned out of nearly $5,000. I went up on
•the hill, even as Moses did when he brought down the ten commandments. I stayed there
for several hours. I repeated the secret words and delivered the prayer of hope. I then
went home and slept soundly. The next day I read in the papers that the robbers became
penitent and secretly returned every cent and every stamo they had stolen. Isn’t that
proof conclusive?”
V kiebach was a Lutheran by virtue of his early training, but now is a believer in the
truths as exponded in the "secret instructions” as contained in "The Sixth And Seventh
Books Of Moses.” Reproduced from “The Reading Eagle,” Tuesday, July 14, 1914.
Note. “THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH ROOKS OF MOSES,” referred to in the newspaper
article by Mr. Kiebach, is fully described on the next page.

HYPNOTISM
Hypnotism, The Magic Word Of The Age, The Magic Word
Of All Past Ages, The Magic Power Of All The Old Philosophers
One Mind Over Another. Hypnotism is now being studied by the smartest men in our leading
colleges and universities. It is as old as the human mind, as aged as the beginning of the world.
Wherever we turn we find indelible traces of the mighty influence of one mind over another.
Hypnotism Strengthens Your Memory, Mind And Will. It overcomes bashfulness, revives hopes,
stimulates ambition and determination to succeed. It gives you the key to the Inner Secrets of
mind control.
The Genesis Of Hypnotism. .Hypnotism is as old as the world. In whatever quarter we
direct our researches, whether it be in dusty old Manuscripts or deciphering Hieroglyphics, we find
the indelible traces of the influence of Hypnotism.
The Temple Of Isis, dedicated to Nature, reveals in its ideological figures—figures, that is,
expressing ideas—that a state of trance was known to the Egyptians. In the Zodiac in the
arched vault of the Temple at Denderah, Isis is depicted holding a child by the hand, while she
passes her other hand in front of him in the attitude of a magnetizer.
In India-, Mythology represents Vishnu with flames issuing from his finger-ends. Some modern
subjects indeed, affirm that they see a blue or violet-colored auro issuing from the hands of the
Magnetic Healer and the Hypnotic Operator; the same thing no doubt took place in the days of
Vishnu. Hippocrates believed in Somnambulistic Powers, and we find ancient writers continually
referring to similar beliefs. The history of the middle ages is full of similar narratives.
Antoine Mesmer. Mesmer is proclaimed the creator of scientific Magnetism the scholar who
has given us the fruitful inheritance now called Hypnotism; whose ideas and labors have led to
vast researches and discoveries that are now being analyzed by our leading men of medical
science. Antoine Mesmer was born in Germany in 1734. At an early age his thoughts were
turned towards the unknown and unfathomable, for we find him at the age of thirty-two discussing
before the Faculty of Vienna, his thesis for the degree of Doctor of Medicine.

MATRIMONY
Marriage The Silver Link That Binds Two Hearts Together
From the earliest ages, the institution of matrimony hau o
cherished as the Holiest and best of Human Institutions. The
and purest in all times have been its most strenuous advocates
its sacred associations, the Painter and Poet have found their hLu :
visions of beauty; and t-he Orator and Essayist, a theme most p n
in its aspirations of eloquence. History shows that in all ages of I’
world that those who have married have formed tha foundation ol .•
dependable political and social government. Marriage is spoken
as the Silver Link; the Silken Thread that binds two honest and will­
ing hearts to joy. It has been likened to the tuning of two lutes in
one key; the melting of two hearts into one ; to the blending of the
Lily with the Rose, and of the natural with a more heavenly const!-
tuence of our nature.
Marriage is spoken of as a Heaven upon earth ; Life’s paradise,
the Soul’s earthly quiet; earth’s immortality; and as an eternity of
pleasure. The history of marriage, which is lost in the night of time,
shows that man’s joys are increased and his sorrows lessened by
marriage ; for it is an institution that has been wisely said to double
the joys and divide the griefs of earthly existence.
Marriage was given to man for his highest good—that the
sweetest and purest; most earnest and heavenly of earthly happiness
is to be found in the sacred enjoyments of the home circle. This is
substantiated by the united testimony of the .wisest and beat of all

There are none so bad that matrimony may not redeem ; none so bright, and pure, and good,
but it will make brighter, purer and better still. So long as aught holy or lovely remain# on earth,
it will be found in the marriage relation. So long as there is joy, its cho«en abode will ba within
the home circle, and should earth ever become so vile that the spirits of purity and goodness
would be impelled to take their leave forever ; their last footprints will be on the hearth-stons
of the home least depraved, and their last association will be with the sacred characters ol
husband and wife. That Section of this work treating upon matrimony is worth ten times the price
asked for the entire book. It shows why every man should marry. Why every woman should
marry. The difficulties -of making marriage. How the married may be happy, etc., etc.

DISSERTATION UPON LOVE
Difficulties Of Getting Married.—There is a dissertation upon Love, showing that Love hath
its Magnet, and is the fountain of happiness ; also a Treatise on Matrimony, explaining, Why all
should marry—Why evfery man should marry—Why every woman should marry—All may marry—
The difficulties of making marriage—The married happy.
Money Making Recipes.—The practical Recipes contained in this work, are worth a great deal
to any intelligent person and especially to the one who contemplates marriage. There are in the
world today, many persons who would like to make from $5.00 to $25.00 a day. If you order and
study this book, you need not longer remain a slave, or be held down to a few dollars a week.
You can make money by the many wonderful things taught in it.
The Great Secret Of Prosperity.—Who. has not had occasion to wonder at the sudden acquired
wealth of some enterprising neighbor of his ; who, one fine morning, to the surprise of his friends,
bought a house or a farm, paid for it in cash; in fact, began to live and dress like a man who had
acquired wealth and had the means to pay for what he wanted. Some would have it that he made
a fortune speculating in Wall Street; others again that he owned a few shares in the Big Bonanza
Silver Mine, which had suddenly quadrupled in value. Other wise-acres knew he had a rich uncle
somewhere; in fact, rumors ran thick and fast while the object of all this flutter and speculation
kept on enjoying the best of all the world’s goods, and did not enlighten others as to the cause of
his prosperity. And now, dear reader, it will certainly be to your interest to learn that the
Secret of Prosperity and real success which saves every one from a drudging and sacrificing
life, is not wealth suddenly gained in Wa.ll Street; nor in gold mines, nor an inheritance from rich
relatives. It is Practical Instruction and Reliable Information as wrell as Valuable Secrets and
Recipes such as are contained in books of this kind that helps one steadily onward to Success
and Financial Independence.
Charles Schwab, one of America’s greatest financiers, says: “The only education worth
while is self-education. Show me a man or executive who, in addition to applying himself whole­
heartedly to his work, is using his spare time in improving his education, and I will have no hesi­
tancy in saying—There is a man who will make good and go far.”
Andrew Carnegie, says: “You cannot push anyone up a ladder unless he is willing to climb
a little himself.”
Ben Franklin, says: “An investment in knowledge pays the best dividends.”
Edison, says: “Instruction by correspondence is the cheapest and best.”
If the one whose eye reads what is written here, has been unfortunate in the past or hasn’t
been successful from a money-earning standpoint, what he needs is IMMEDIATE APPLICA­
TION; for what he does now will govern what he earns and has in the future. This is an im­
portant matter; because it involves yourself, those you love, those who are depending upon you,
and your own ultimate success. If you slack, or stall, or dodge the issue now, it simply means that
you are missing a better position in life, better pay, and better profits for your future. The idea is

THE SEVENTH BOOK.—For the one who watches for opportunity and takes advantage
of it, there are always certain ways and certain means of gaining from the Great Storehouse of
Nature, valuable information that may be used in a speedy and honorable way. Much of this
knowledge is contained on the pages of this book, which the author claims was taken from the
SEVENTH BOOK, and that by its use one can be saved from want and poverty. He claims that
the Celebrated Jewish Law-giver wrote SEVEN BOOKS. Six of which you may be acquainted
with, but the GREAT SEVENTH BOOK, which was a most valuable, production, was suppressed
by the Council of Nice, in the year of 360 ; yet in the Fourth. Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth,
and Tenth Chapters of Exodus that the Council of Bishops happened to let pass some things which
gave a slight knowledge of what the GREAT SEVENTH BOOK, which wzas his best Thoughts
and Teachings, really were.
Secrets Kept Away From Mankind. But his GREAT CENTRAL SECRET which was his
CHIEF SECRET of all SECRETS, is given in his Wonderful and Mysterious SEVENTH BOOK
and whosoever reads what has been taken from this GREAT SEVENTH BOOK, suppressed, as it
was by the Spanish, French, German, Italian, and English Governments will see what a valuable
treasure was for a long time kept away from mankind in general.
Should Sell For $4.00 A Copy.—The author of this work states that when it was first
translated that the book sold rapidly at $25.00 a copy. The price of our NEW REVISED
EDITION, bound in cloth is only $1.75 ; Foreign 9s. The price of the PAPER BOUND Edition
is only $1.35 ; Foreign 8s. This is indeed quite a reduction for an entirely New Edition printed
on good paper and well bound. This book should really, if it was placed on sale in accordance
with other books, sell for no less than $4.00. Publishers today are asking $3.00 and $3.50 for books
on fiction by very ordinary and commonplace authors. A worthless love story, a commonplace
novel, is sold today by publishers for $2.50 each. This is a scientific and a technical work and if
others had published it in an up-to-date manner, they would have asked $4.00 or $5.00 a copy for
it. This book contains almost 350 pages and if you doubt what has been stated above, go into any
book shop and select a book that is well bound, printed on good paper, containing 350 pages or
more and see if you can buy it for $1.75. The chances are that you will be asked about $4.00.
You understand, of course, that the one who runs a bookstore is put to no expense of advertising
or sending his book by mail. The person who buys the book, takes it home himself ; whereas books
sold by The de Laurence Co. must be featured and advertised at a cost of hundreds and sometimes
thousands of dollars. The book must then be sent in a special mailing case, usually by registered
mail prepaid; so that after all of the costs of manufacturing, current expenses for clerical
help, mailing cases for books, postage, losses, etc. have been deducted, you will realize that there
is very little profit in selling a 350 page book bound in cloth for $1.75. This fact should be clearly
understood so that you will realize you are not being imposed upon when this interesting and
really valuable book is offered to you at such a low price.
Valuable Information.—There may be one thing you witi ifearn from it that will be worth hundreds
of dollars to you. You may learn from this book how to cure yourself of some trouble or disease.
You may learn from it how to perform some Secret Thing that will be the means of your making
a lot of money; for it teaches Hundreds and Hundreds of different ways to perform some very
wonderful and mysterious operations.

becomes stagnate. Many people today are failures because they would not take advantage of an

couple of hours.

TREASURE CASKETS.
Nature’s Mysteries.—The author of “THE SILENT
FRIEND’’ claims that this wonderful TREASURE CASKET
OF MYSTERIES was written by the Celebrated A. Pharvi. That
it was an extraordinary work which contained many Secrets.
It became very Rare and Scarce and it is said that the only
copy which was in existence sold for a large amount.
The author of THE SILENT FRIEND, says that: “The
true seeker for knowledge that desires to fathom the most Hidden
Mysteries of Nature, must give his most innermost attention
to the material which I, with great care and expense, have com­
piled in this Volume. With perfect right it lays claim to the title
of the Universal Treasure Casket, as it contains, in a limited
space, wonders to delight the entire human race. The Merchant,
the Citizen, the Laborer, as well as the Youth, the Maiden, the
Wife, as well as the Husband, will receive it as a medium to
accomplish their most heartfelt desires. But in order to avoid
mistakes, and to make this Volume more valuable and
useful to the reader, I have Classified the different material, so as to prevent any misunderstanding
that may arise. At the same time this may not be the wrong place to assure my readers, that
wonderful as the Secrets are, that I reveal to yon, they do not go beyond the Power of Nature ;
•specially over those living creatures that inhabit ilte air, the earth, and the waters. For as. it says,

that the Wise, by means of his knowledge shall command the Stars, just so that certain Stars, by
means of their Wonderful Influence will aid the possessor of such knowledge. Whoever has not
studied the sublime art of Astronomy, must either inquire of one that has, or consult a good
Almanac, whenever he wishes to practice any Mystery, that is dependent upon the aspect of the
Planets, in order to insure the success of his operations.”
“History and ancient chronicles teach us that Charles the Great received a book from the
Pope, which consisted of nothing but Figures and Mysterious words ; and that he used the same
on numerous occasions with unvarying success. The title of this book was (Enchiridium Leonis
Papae) Pope Leo’s Hand Book, and has maintained its celebrity in spite of the most malignant
opposition by skeptical minds. In closing, I must call the attention of the reader to the fact, that
he or she will not find anything of a trivial or obscene nature in this book. It is an extract of the
most wonderful Writings that have been aided and perfected by the powerful influence of Nature
and Art. It is not that I claim all that is herein contained as my own property and invention, for I
openly confess that they are but extracts from the Manuscripts of renowned Philosophers, who
have collected all that was wonderful in the course of nature. I will vouch for the same, and would
not hesitate to make any of the experiments herein described upon my own person.”

“Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.” (50th Psalm)
The author in the Preface of this book says: I would
have preferred writing no preface whatever to this book,
were it not indispensably necessary, in order to meet the
erroneous views some men entertain in regard to works of
this character. The majority, undoubtedly, approve of the
publication and sale of such books, yet some are always found
who will persist in denouncing them as something wrong.
This latter class I cannot help but pity, for being so far led
astray; and I earnestly pray everyone who might find it in
his power to bring them from off their ways of error. It
is true, whosoever taketh the name of Jesus in vain com-
mitteth a great sin. Yet, is it not expressly written in the
Fiftieth Psalm, according to Luther’s translation : “Call upon
me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt
glorify me.” In the Catholic translation, the same passage
is found in the Forty-ninth Psalm, reading thus : “Call upon
me in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou
shalt glorify me.”
Where is the remedy which has ever cured or banished
the panting or palpitation of the heart?
Where is the remedy which ever banished a wheal?
Where is the remedy which ever banished the fits? Where is
the remedy that can cure mortification when it once seizes a
member of the body? Remedies and a great many more
mysterious and wonderful things, are contained in this book;
and I could take an oath at any time that I have successfully
used the prescriptions in this book.
I say: any and every man who knowingly neglects using
this book in saving the eye, or the leg, or any other limb of
his fellow-man, is guilty of the loss of such limb, and thus commits a sin, by which he may forfeit
to himself all hope of salvation. Such men refuse to call upon the Lord in their trouble, although He
especialy commands it. If men were not allowed to use sympathetic words, nor the name of the
MOST HIGH, it certainly would not have been revealed to them; and what is more, the Lord would
not help where they are made use of. God can in no manner be forced to intercede where it is
not his divine pleasure.
Another thing I have to notice here: There are men who
will say, if one has used sympathetic words in vain, the medicines
of doctors could not avail any, because the words did not effect
a cure. This is only the excuse of physicians ; because whatever
cannot be helped by sympathetic words can much less be cured
by any doctors.
I could name at any time that Catholic priest whose horse
was cured with mere words ; and I could also give the name of
the man who did it. I knew the priest well; he formerly resided
in Westmoreland county. If it was desired, I could also name
a Reformed preacher who helped several people of the fever,
merely by writing them some Talismans and other strange figures
for that purpose ; and even the names of those persons I could
mention. This preacher formerly resided in Berks county.
If men but use out of this book what they actually need,
they surely commit no sin; yet woe unto those who are guilty
that anyone loses his life in consequence of mortification, or loses
a limb, or the sight of the eye! Woe unto those who misconstrue
these things at the moment of danger, or who follow the ill advice
of any one who might teach them not to mind what the Lord
says in the Fiftieth Psalm.
“Call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and
thou shalt glorify me.” Woe unto those who, in obeying the direc­
tions of anyone, neglect any means offered in this book in
accordance with the word of God, against mortification, or inflam­
mation, or the wheal. I am willing to follow any intelligent man in all reasonable things, yet when
I am in danger and he advises me not to use any prescriptions found in this book, in such a case
I shall not obey him. And woe also unto those who use the name of the Lord in vain and for
trifling purposes.
I have given many proofs and testimonials of the usefulness of this book, and I could yet
do it at any time. I sell my books publicly, and not secretly, as other mystical books are sold.
I am willing that my book should be seen by everybody, and I shall not secrete or hide myself
from anyone. I, John George Hohman, too, have some knowledge of the Scriptures, and I know
when to pray and call unto the Lord for assistance. The publication of books (provided they
are useful and morally right) is not prohibited in the United States, as is the case in other
countries where kings and despots hold tyrannical sway over the people. I place myself upon
the broad platform of the liberty of the press and of conscience in regard to this useful book,
and it shall ever be my most heartfelt desire that all men might have an opportunity of using ft
to their good, in the name of Jesus.
Given at Rosenthal near Reading, Berks county, Penn., on the 31st day of July, in the
year of our Lord, 1819. JOHN GEORGE HOHMAN, Author and original publisher of this book.

TESTIMONY THAT I, JOHN GEORGE HOHMAN
Have Successfully Applied The Prescriptions In
Pow-Wows Or Long Lost Friend
Benjamin Stoudt, the son of a Lutheran
schoolmaster, at Reading, suffered dreadfully
from a wheal in the eye. In a little more
than 24 hours this eye was as sound as the
other one, by the aid I rendered him with
the help of God, in the year 1817.
Henry Jorger, residing in Reading, brought
to me a boy who suffered extreme pain, caused
by a wheal in the eye, in the year 1814. In
a little more than 24 hours I, with the help
of God, have healed him.
John Bayer, son of Jacob Bayer, now
living near Reading, had an ulcer on his leg,
which gave him great pain. I attended him,
and in a short time the leg was well. This
was in the year 1818.
Landlin Gottwald, formerly residing in
Reading, had a severe pain in his one arm.
In about 24 hours I cured his arm.
Catharine Meek, at that time in Alsace
township, suffered very much from a wheal
in the eye. In a little more than 24 hours
the eye was healed.
Mr. Silvis, of Reading, cam* to my hous* while engaged at the brewery of my neighbor. He
f*lt great pain tn the eye, caused by a wheal I cured his eye in a little more than 24 hours.
Anna Snyd»r. of Alsac* township, had a. severe pain in one of her fingers. In a little more
than 24 hours she felt relieved.
Michael Hartman, Jr., living In Alsace township, had a child with a very sore mouth. I
attended it and tn a little more than twenty-four hours it was well again.
John Bingeman, of Ruscombmanor, Berks county, had a boy who burnt himself dreadfully.
My wife came to that place in the fall of the year 1812. Mortification had already set in—my
wife had sympathy for it, and in a short time the mortification was banished. The boy was soon
after perfectly cured and became well again. It was about the same time that my wife cured
John Bingeman’s wife of the wild-fire, which she had on a sore leg.
Susanna Gombor had a severe pain in the head. In a short time I relieved her. The wife
of David Brecht also felt a severe pain in the head, and was relieved by me in a short time.
John .Tunkins’ daughter and daughter-in-law both suffered
very much pain in the head, and his wife, too, had a sore cheek,
on which the wild-fire had broken out severely. The head­
ache of the daughter and the daughter-in-law was banished
by me ; and the wild-fire of the wife was cured in some seven
or nine hours; the swelled cheek burst open and healed very
fast. The woman had been laid up several days already on
account of it. The family of Junkins live at Nackenmixen, but
Brecht and Gomber reside in and near Reading. Nackenmixen
Is in Bucks county. The four last mentioned were cured in the
year 1819.
The daughter of John Arnold scalded herself with boiling
coffee ; the handle of the pot broke off while she was pouring
out coffee, and the coffee ran over the arm and burnt it severely.
I was present and witnessed the accident. I banished the
burning; the arm did not get sore at all, and healed in a short
time. This was in the year 1815. Mr. Arnold lived near Lebanon,
Lebanon county, Penn.
Jacob Stouffer, at Heckak; Bucks county, had a little child
who was subject to convulsions. I sold him a book containing the
25 letters, and he was persuaded by his neighbor, Henry Frank-
enfield, to try these 25 letters. The result was that the child was instantaneously free from
convulsions and perfectly well. These letters are also to be found in this book.
John Allgaier, of Reading, Penn., had a very sore finger. I used sympathy to banish the
wild-fire and to cure the finger. The very next morning the wild-fire was gone; he scarcely
felt any pain, and the finger began to heal very fast. This was in 1819.
This book is partly derived from a work published by a Gypsy, and partly from Secret
Writings, and collected with much trouble, from all parts of the world, at different periods, by
myself, John George Hohman. I did not wish to publish it; my wife, also, was opposed to its
publication; but my compassion for my suffering fellow-men was too strong, for I had seen
many a one lose his entire sight by a wheal, and his life or limb by mortification. And how
dreadfully has many a woman suffered from mother-fits! And I therefore ask thee again, oh
friend, male or female, is it not to my everlasting praise that I have had such a book printed?
Do I not deserve th* rewards of God for it? Where else is the physician that could cure
these diseases?
A Prayer. The Lord bless the beginning and the end of this work, and be with us, that
we may not misuse it, and thus commit a heavy sin ! The word misuse means as much as to
use it for anything unnecessary. God bless us! Amen. The word Amen means as much as
that the Lord might bring to pass in reality what had been asked for in prayer.—John George
Hohman.
NOTE. Thera are many in America who believe neither in a hell nor in a heaven; but
in Germany there are not so many of these persons found. I, John George Hohman, say:
“All this Is done hy the Lord and I think very little of any one who denies it.”

GOOD AND BAD OMENS OF THE DOG
By L. W. de Laurence
There is no question but what a dog, in a
certain sense, is a medium or instrument through
which both good and bad omens are manifested.
In view of the great devotion which a dog has
for its master as well as its keen scent, it is
not to be wondered that much folk-lore, which
some foolishly term superstition, has accum­
ulated around it.
Everybody is familiar with the superstition
about the dog baying at the moon being ,an omen
of death, and if it howls twice and stops it is
for a man ; if three times, a woman.
Did you know, that if you make a wish on
seeing a spotted dog, and you do not see it
again, you will get your wish?
If a girl dislikes dogs, she will never get
a good husband.
If you meet a mastiff dog, and it makes
friends with you, you will soon meet some one
who will prove a good true friend to you.
It is bad luck to give a dog away.
If you accidentally step on a dog, there will ensue a change in your vocation.
A little white dog is supposed to be a messenger of coming evil.
Another interpretation of the dog howling heavenward is that it fore-tells a great fire disaster or a calamity of some kind.
In slavery times the Negroes thought that if they wanted to keep dogs from scenting their tracks, they should go to the
graveyard, get some dirt out of a grave and rub their feet with it.
It is bad luck to meet a barking dog early in the morning.
The lively barking of dogs in Lent is a sign of a wedding to which there is much objection.
If a dog dies under your house, it is a sign that you will soon move to another residence.
The Indians offered up a small dog when a child lay sick, supposing the dog to be the cause.
It is good luck to have a dog return after it has been driven away.
If the pet dog is unhappy, its master is the same.
To encounter a Mongrel dog is to expect sickness in the family. ,
In ancient Persia if one was dying a dog was brought in to drive away the waiting demons.
It is unlucky for a dog to pass between a couple who are going to be married or between two friends.
If your dog leaves home, as somedogshave a habit of doing, you can make himstay home byplacing a fewhairs from
the end of his tail under the steps at theentrance to your home.
If on entering a strange house adog should make much of you, especially if itshould lay its head on yourlap, you
are going to meet a man who will be a strong and faithful friend.
It is good luck to be followed by a dog if it comes of its own accord.
For a strange dog to track up a newly scrubbed porch is a sign the family will move soon.
When you pick out a friend do not take the man whose dog never wants to follow him. Also beware of the man your
dog refuses to make friends with.
If a pet dog utters inarticulate sounds as if trying to speak you will hear news.
Dogs rubbing their noses on the floor is a sign of windy weather.
The ancient Gauls believed a dog knew of its master’s death, no matter how far they were separated.
It is a good sign if a dog approaches a sick person; but a bad omen If it walks away or refuses to make friends
For a sleeping dog to bark is supposed to be a sign of impending ill.
If a strange dog follows you waging its tail you will receive a letter.
If a dog wallows on his back, he is said to be measuring somebody’s grave. .
The southern Negroes hate the hound. They say it used to be a nice sleek watch dog which Adam left to guard the
gate of Paradise, but it went snuffing around to find a hare or rabbit and let the old devil sneak in. Then t. ° Lira sai l,
it should be a dog no longer, but a hound, always hunting and always starving, so to hear a hound is a ba i si n.
In ancient Egypt, to put a dog to death, was as if you murdered your grandfather. ;
The ancie. t Persian would never kill a dog, for if he did he would slay his own soul, and the effect's of the act would
continue to the ninth generation.
In Japan it is unlucky to kill a dog. .
will not kill a pariah dog; lo do this is the sign of a terrible calamity.

INFINITE WISDOM
A Remarkable Book
Translated From Ancient Manuscripts Found In The Archives Of The
Grand Temple In Thibet
Adjoining China on the west
is the strange and mysterious
country of Thibet, called by
some, Barantola. In a prov­
ince of this country, named
Lassa, resided the Grand Lama,
or High Priest, of these peo­
ple; who was reverenced and
even adored as a god by most
of the neighboring nations.
The high opinion which was
entertained of his sacred char­
acter induced prodigious num­
bers of religious people to
come to Lassa to pay their
homage to him, and to receive
his blessing. )
His residence was in a most
magnificent Pagod, or Temple,
built on the top of the moun­
tain Poutala. The foot of this
mountain, and even the whole
district of Lassa was, at this
time, inhabited by an incredible
number of Master Lamas of
different ranks and orders; sev­
eral of whom have, indeed,
very Grand Pagods erected to
their honor, in which they re­
ceived worship. The whole
country abounded with Master
Lamas, and they entirely sub­
sisted on the great number of
rich presents which were sent
them from the utmost extent
of Tartary, from the empire of
the Great Mogul, and from
• many parts of India. When
Ancient Temple Of Thibet the Grand Lama received the
adorations of the people, he
was raised on a magnificent
altar of gold, and sat cross-legged upon a costly cushion. His worshippers prostrated
themselves before him, in the humblest and most abject manner; but he returned not the
least sign of respect; never spoke, even to the Greatest Princes. He only laid his hand
upon their heads, and they were fully persuaded that they received from thence a full
forgiveness of all their sins. This Grand Lama is said to know all things; even the
secrets of the heart; and his particular disciples, being a select number of about two
hundred of the most Eminent Lamas, claimed that he is immortal, and that whenever
he appeared to die, he only changed his abode, and animated a new body.
The learned in China had long been of the opinion that, in the Archives of this Grand Temple, some
very Ancient Manuscripts had for many ages been concealed ; and the Emperor of China, who was very
curious in searching after the writings of antiquity, became at length so fully convinced of the probability
of this opinion that he determined to try whether any discovery of this sort could be made. To this end
his first care was to find a person eminently learned in the Ancient Languages and characters. He at
length decided upon one of the Hanlins, or Doctors of the first order, whose name was Doctor
Cao-Tsou, a man about fifty years of age, of a grave and noble aspect, of great eloquence, and who, by an
accidental friendshir' with a certain learned Master Lama, who had resided many years at Pekin, had
become a master of the language which the Lamas of Thibet used among themselves.
With these qualifications, he set forward on his journey; and to give his commission the greater weight,
the Emperor ot tjaina honored him with the title of Colao, or Prime Minister; to which he added a most
magnificent equipage and attendants, with gold and costly presents for the Grand Lama, and the other
principal Lamas, of an immense value; also the letter which is shown on the next page.

retrieve the wisdom of the ages that are past; and being well informed, that in the
sacred repositories of thy most ancient and venerable hierarchy, there are some
valuable books, which, from their great antiquity, have become, to the generality,
even of the learned, almost wholly unintelligible.
Now in order, as far as in us lies, to prevent their being totally lost, we have
thought proper to authorize and employ our most learned and respected Prime
Minister, Cao-tsou, in this our present embassy to thy Sublime Holiness: the busi­
ness of which is to desire, that he may be permitted to read and examine the said
Ancient Writings; we, expecting from his great and uncommon skill in the ancient
languages, that he will be able to interpret whatever may be found, though of the
highest and most obscure antiquity. And we have commanded him to throw him­
self at thy feet, with such testimonies of our respect, as, we trust, will precure him
the admittance we desire.
The Emperor's Embassy Gains Admission To The Grand Temple
When Doctor Cao-Tsou, Prime Minister of China, arrived in those sacred territories, the magnificence
of his appearance, and the richness of his presents, failed not to gain him a ready admission to the presence
of the Grand Lama. He had apartments appointed him in the Sacred College, and was assisted in his
inquiries by one of the most learned Lamas. He remained there nearly six months, during which time he
had the satisfaction of finding many valuable pieces of Ancient Manuscripts, from some of which he made
very curious extracts and has formed such probable conjectures concerning their authors and the times
wherein they were written as proves Doctor Cao-Tsou to be a man of great judgment and penetration, as
well as most extensive reading.
But the most ancient piece of Ancient Manuscript discovered, and which none of the Master Lamas for
many ages had been able to translate, intrepret, or understand, is a most remarkable system of morality,
written in the language and character of the Ancient Gymnosophists or Brahmans; but by what particular
person, or in what age, Doctor Cao-Tsou does not pretend to determine. This piece of very Ancient Manu­
script, however, he wholly translated, though, as he himself confesses, with an utter incapacity of reaching,
in the Chinese language, the strength and sublimity of the original. The judgments and opinions of the
Bonzees, and the learned Doctors, are very much divided concerning it. Those who admire it the most
highly are very fond of attributing it to Confucius, their own great philosopher, and get over the difficulty
of its being written in the language and character of the Ancient Brahmans, by supposing this to be only a
translation, and that the original work of Confucius is lost. Some claim it to have been written by Lao-Kium,
another Chinese philosopher, contemporary with Confucius, and founder of the sect Taosse; but these labor
under the same difficulty, in regard to the language, with those who attribute it to Confucius. There are
others, who, from some particular marks and sentiments which they find in it, suppose it to be written
by the Brahman Dandamis, whose famous letter to Alexander the Great is recorded by the European
writers. With these Doctor Cao-Tsou himself seems most inclined to agree, at least so far as to think that
it is really the work of some Ancient and Venerable Brahman. But whoever was the writer of it, the great
interest which it aroused in Pekin, and all over the Chinese Empire; the eagerness with which it was read
by al! kinds of people, and the high encomiums which was given to it, justifies an English translation of it.

The Emperor Discovers Doctor Cao-tsou
As stated above, the history of this
remarkable book is curious and in­
tricate. A brief outline of it is as
follows:
About the middle of the Seven­
teenth Century the Emperor of China
learned that in the Archives of the
Grand Temple of Thibet, there were
certain Ancient Manuscripts which, if
translated into Chinese, would be of
untold value to himself and the in­
habitants of his Great Empire. The
more he thought over -it, the greater
became his intense desire to retrieve
the Wisdom of the past ages, to
search into the records of antiquity
and obtain from their sacred reposi­
tories, in the Archives of the Ancient
and Venerable Hierarchy, certain old
Manuscripts written in the languages
and characters of the Ancient Gym-
nosophists, who were a hermit class
of Ancient Hindu Philosophers ad­
dicted to Religious Mysticism . and
Asceticism. These Ancient, Philoso­
phers are, by Strabo, divided into
Brahmans _and Shamans. '
Nobody "knew better than the Em­
peror the great difficulty which con­
fronted him in finding a man suffi­
ciently learned, in the language of the
Ancient Gymnosophists, to be able to
translate the Manuscripts which had
become venerable with age while
lying in the Archives of the Grand
Temple. After a long search he
finally discovered Doctor Cao-Tsou,
who, as it happened, belonged to the
first order of Hanlins or Doctors of
China.
Doctor Cao-Tsou was a man about
fifty years of age, of a grave and
noble aspect, of great eloquence, and
who, by an accidental friendship with
a certain learned Lama, who had
resided many years at Pekin, had
become entirely master of the ancient
language which the Lamas of Thibet
use among themselves. In order to
give the Doctor and his commission
prestige and power, the Emperor ap­
pointed him Prime Minister of China.
The Emperor’s next great diffi­
culty was in obtaining the Grand
Lama’s consent to allow Doctor Cao-
Tsou to translate into Chinese cer­
tain Ancient writings in the Archives
of the Grand Temple.
It was the Emperor’s dearest wish
in life that his learned embassy be
permitted to study and examine these
Old Manuscripts, and to translate into
Chinese the remarkable System of Virtue and Morality written in the language and character of the Ancient
Gymnosophists.
If he, the Emperor, could obtain the Grand Lama’s consent to allow his Prime Minister to enter the
sacred repositories of the venerable Hierarchy, and translate into Chinese the rare old Manuscripts, which
were useless, even to the most learned erf the Chinese Empire, unless translated by one who was a master of
the ancient language in which they were written, he would be. able to retrieve and preserve from oblivion,
as well as perpetuate for posterity, the wisdom of the ages which are past.
The learned men of China as well as the Bonzees, who are a class of Buddhist monks that believe in
Buddhism, were also, like the Emperor, strongly impressed that, in the Archives of the Grand Temple,
there were Ancient Eastern Instructions which were imbued with the Divine Spirit of Virtue and Morality.
The Long Journey Into Thibet
As Doctor Cao-Tsou possessed all of the qualifications that the Emperor desired in one. who was to b®
sent on such an important and costly commission, he was started forward on his long journey into the
mysterious land of Thibet, which adjoins China on the west. The area of Thibet is about 464,000 square
miles, is about 15,000 feet above the sea level, and its plains average 10,000 feet in height. Many of its
mountains have an altitude of 20,000 feet. It occupies the great plateau of Central Asia, lying between
longitude 73 and 110 East, and latitude 27 and '36 North; extending east and west from Cashmere and
the Karahorum Range to the frontiers of China.
To give his commission greater prestige and power, the Emperor, as stated above, honored Doctor
Cao-Tsou with the title of Colao, or Prime Minister; to which he added a most magnificent equipage and
attendants. He also sent large amounts of gold, silver, precious stones, jewels, magnificent and costly
presents to be given to the Grand Lama and the other Principal Lamas. Doctor Cao-Tsou was directed
to prostrate himself at the feet of the Grand Lama as a testimony of China’s great respect and also to
give his Holiness the gold, silver, precious stones, jewels and other costly presents, worth a fabulous sum,
so that he would be admitted.
The richness of the presents gained Doctor Cao-Tsou ready admission to the presence of the Grand Lama,
who had special quarters appointed for. him in the Sacred College and ordered, that he be assisted, in his
inquiries after certain Ancient Manuscripts, by the most learned of the Lamas in the Temple.
Doctor Cao-Tsou remained almost six months in the Grand Temple, during which time he. had the satis­
faction of finding many valuable pieces of Ancient Manuscripts. From these he made copies and formed
such probable conjectures concerning their authors, as well as the age in which they were written, that
proved the Doctor to be a man of great judgment and learning.

Like A Great Pyramid Of Glittering Gold
It is the peer of all books. Its glorious teachings stand out like a great Pyramid of
glittering gold.
Like a huge Cathedral, it is something to go to for truth and hope.
It shows you that the greatest and most precious jewels in life are virtue, rectitude,
and moral integrity.
After you begin to read this book, you become fascinated and thrilled; you begin to
realize the extraordinary God-given, divinely inspired ability of its ancient author; his
sincerity appalls you.
This old Philosopher, whose identity is lost in the night of time, possesses the power
to teach you, and to give you the Wisdom and Knowledge for which your soul may be
suffering.
Like a kind father he shows you those dangers which always bring disaster to the
human soul that is destitute of Wisdom.
After reading this book you feel as if you had paid a visit t» the Sacred Repositories
and Archives of a Great Temple whose <j°orkeeper is justice and honor.
You begin to feel that its author speaks with the great authority of God, but this
authority is always modified with a love and benevolence that is rich with human interest,
impregnated with a power and inward spirit that is high and lofty.
It brings to you reminiscences of the wisdom of bygone ageSj the knowledge of a
Godly inspired soul.
It shines forth like a beacon light of Hope and Inspiration.
Glitters with the Gold Nuggets of Wisdom.
So far, the whole history of humanity has been marked by the revolts of Righteous men’s souls against
the pitfalls of sin and its sorrows, which are everywhere before the one who wanders from the light of
wisdom and virtue.
This book, by one who wished to wring deceit and evil from the human soul, and to fill it with the
Moral Precepts of life, has at last, two thousand five hundred years after its inspired contents were written,
accomplished its object.
This is proven by the great acclaim with which it has been received in this age.
It manifests to the righteous one the safest harbour in the ocean of human existence in which to anchor
the soul.
From the Bible to Dickens
M£ny thinking1 people, and this refers to those who are of a philosophical turn of mind, have asked
themselves the dangerous question: “What is the best book, after I have finished the Bible, for me to read
so as to understand the Divine Wisdom of God?”
After you have read this book, you will realize that it answers this question; for you feel like you had
enjoyed a holiday in Heaven; like you had been transported through the golden gates of Wisdom with
God’s sunbeams of Eternal Truth shining upon you.
Many have said to themselves: “The book I should most like to read has never been written, so far as
I know.”
This book supplies the want, for it contributes toward a new technique of virtue and, therefore, toward
a better understanding of God’s Wisdom.
The things yet undone by us, and, unknown to our soul, are always the best.
The best book, many believe, that ever could be published is one that will teach a new technique of
human conduct and thought.
A learned man, after reading this book, says:
“As I looked backward over all the books that I have read—from the Bible to Dickens—I found myself
asking the question: What is the very best book that I should read now, for the betterment of my soul?
I realized, of course, that it would be a hard task to find one. In this book, ‘Infinite Wisdom,’ I find all
of the requisite qualities needed for the purpose. It settles, for me, all questions regarding philosophies
and creeds, and I look upon it as the best book of any age, for it was written by a most trenchant writer.”

The Archaeological And Historical Writings Of The
Sanhedrin And Taimuds Of The Jews
The Contents of This Book Were Taken From the Ancient Parchments and
Scrolls At Constantinople and the Vatican At Rome
The Very Same Being a Record
Made By the Enemies of Jesus of Nazareth in His Day
Positively Guaranteed to Be Accurate and Authentic
The Most Interesting History of Jesus Extant
-Ry Rev. W. D. Mahan
I
Author Of Acta Pilati, And Hebrew Histtiry Of Baptism.
No event since the dawn of Christianity, or, in fact, in
any age of the world, is of as much real importance to
thinking men and women as the death of Jesus of Nazareth.
Again, no great event of this kind could ever have trans­
pired without some official record being made of it by the
enemies of Jesus in their courts, legislations and histories.
Full particulars of this event is given in the Ancient Parch­
ments and Scrolls now in the Vatican at Rome and at
Constantinople. It is to these ancient manuscripts one
must go for the genuine truth regarding the life and death
of Jesus, the Nazarene. It is true that much has been
written and published on this subject, but this is positively
the only official record in book form that has ever been
translated direct by learned and truthful men from the
official records in the archives at Rome.
This book, “The Archaeological And Historical Writings
Of The Ancient Sanhedrin And Taimuds Of The Jews,”
is positively and absolutely guaranteed to be accurate and
authentic. It was written by Rev. W. D. Mahan, a well-
known and greatly honored minister.
Knowledge Gained At Risk Of Life And Great Expenditure Of Money
Many years ago the Rev. W. D. Mahan commenced to investigate the subject pf the life and death of
Jesus. After years of study, and after consulting various histories and corresponding with many scholars,
he secured the assistance of two learned men, Drs. McIntosh and Twyman, and went direct to the Vatican
at Rome, and from there to the Jewish Taimuds at’ Constantinople, incurring a risk of his life as well as
expending a large amount of money. The result was that he compiled his intensely interesting book,
which had become rare and valuable. However, an old copy of it has just been obtained at great expense
by de Laurence and published. It is one. of the most remarkable, most strange and interesting books
ever read; for it must be remembered that it is an accurate and an official work obtained by learned men
direct from records made nearly two thousand years ago.
Every statement made here can be absolutely proven. The book itself is evidence of every claim made
for it.
No other book just like this one has ever been written. Its author omitted nothing; spared no expense;
he risked his life; gave years of his time, and spent a fortune in order to obtain, direct from the Ancient
Parchments and Scrolls in the Vatican at Rome and Constantinople, a translation of records made ages
and ages ago.
The Rev. W. D. Mahan was himself a very learned man. His books, “Acta Pilati” and “Hebrew His­
tory Of Baptism,” are pronounced by authorities to be incomparable. His sincerity and great knowledge
appals you, while his monumental knowledge fascinates you and you feel, after reading his book, that you
were as well compensated as if you had knelt at the shrine of tradition.
He and his learned assistants, Drs. McIntosh and Twyman, not only translated writings which belong
to ages, which io us, are lost in the night of time, but they explain the meaning and use of the unusual
words found in the Taimuds, which were written on Parchment or Papyrus. The Scrolls from which
this book has been translated are about twenty inches wide and rolled around a windlass. From these
Ancient Scrolls there have been many books written by the Jewish Rabbis.
The most important of these books is The Mishna. This name indicates what it is—the Law. It con­
tains the laws of all nations, or a part of the laws of the various nations of the earth, such as the Jewish
Sanhedrin thought were compatible with the laws of God. Its principal teachings are what we would call
the moral law of God—that is to say, anything is right if God says it is right, and that is the only reason
why it is right. This work, The Mishna, has been the great reference book for the Jewish Rabbis in all
ages. It was translated and compiled by Hillel, and is a very useful book for good scholars.
The Rev. W. D. Mahan shows that the next in point of value, taken from the Taimuds, is the Tosephta.
This word in the Hebrew means “Treatment,” and contains mainly the Ritual of the Temple Service. It is
a very extensive work, and is really a regulator of human life.
Then comes the Mechilta, which means “Government” in the Hebrew language. Thisbook tells of
the organization of the Sanhedrin and its powers—both the greater and the lesser; the greater to be
composed of seventy and the lesser of twenty-four. These two legislative bodies, Rev. Mahan shows, had
control of the whole of the Jewish commonwealth, and although they exercised great power, their power
was not absolute. He also shows that there was another court that held the highest auhority of the nation.
That was the court of Elders and Priests. The court consisted of twelve men, and its chairman was a
(Continued on next page)
THE de LAURENCE COMPANY 329
High Priest. It decided all appeals and could not be appealed from. Rev. Mahan shows that this really
was the court that tried Jesus of Nazareth; and although it was a court of appeals, the capital crimes
were tried by no court but this.
This book of Rev. Mahan which, as stated before, has been reproduced from a rare old copy obtained
by de Laurence, gives the form of a trial of a criminal in this court, as it is given in the book Mechilta,
which is one of the books from the Talmud, written by the Jewish Rabbis. The Rev. Mahan also shows
that at the time Jesus was tried by this court, the Jewish government had lost its executive power
entirely, and that this was one of the conceded points in the capitulation by Augustus Caesar. At this
time the Roman Emperor’s consent had to be obtained, though he had to use the Jewish soldiers, for the
Romans had only one hundred soldiers at Jerusalem, being all the time engaged in war and needing all
their soldiers at home. When a criminal was brought before this court of the High Priest, they went
through a preliminary trial, in order, if possible, to bring him to an acknowledgment. If they could not,
he was sentenced, and then sent to the Roman authority,_ or governor, for his approval. He was then
sent back to the high priest, and from there to the Sanhedrin, with the charges written out and the names
of the witnesses by which these things had been proven. If they approved the decision of the high
priest, the prisoner was sent back to the high priest for trial. . This court of twelve men was required by
the Jewish law to fast and pray one whole day before the trial commenced, then they were required to
bring the urim and thummim out of the holy place where they were kept, and to place them before the
high priest. He was closely veiled, so that no one could see him, thus representing God doing His work.
Then there was what was called the lactees, consisting of two men, one of whom stood at the door of the
court with a red flag in his hand and the other sat on a white horse some distance on the road that led to
the place of execution. Each one of these men continually cried the name of the criminal, his crime, who
were the witnesses, and called upon any person who knew anything in his favor to come forward and
testify. After the testimony was taken the eleven men cast lots or voted, and their decision was shown to
the high priest. As he was too holy to act of himself, but only as the mouthpiece of God, he went up to
a basin or an ewer, as it is called by them, and washed his hands in token of the innocency of the court,
thus testifying that the criminal’s own action had brought condemnation on himself. As soon as the
soldiers saw this, they took the man to the place of execution, and there stoned him till he was dead.
Not one of them was allowed to speak, not even to whisper, while the execution was going on. Nothing
was heard but the pelting of stones and the shrieks of the criminal. As this was one of the most awful
modes of death, its object evidently was to deter others from committing crime.
Beautiful Chain Of Divine Providence
Brought Out In The Execution Of Jesus Of Nazareth
After learning that the above was the mode of Roman execution, one cannot help but see what a beauti­
ful chain of divine Providence is brought out in the execution of Jesus of Nazareth. There was a law in
the criminal code of the Romans, enacted by Meeleesen, who was a Greek by birth and a philosopher by
nature, that taught that if a man was accused of a crime and was tried and found guilty, he should be
publicly chastised. His reasons were that the man had acted improperly—so much so that he had created
suspicion. This would seem to give license to an enemy to work mischief. But the same philosopher had
a remedy at hand, and that was, that any man who accused another and failed to prove it by two wit­
nesses should suffer the punishment the other would have suffered had he been proven guilty. After the
whipping was over, the Roman officer washed his hands, thereby declaring that the actions of the man
had produced his own chastisement. Thus, after Pilate had Jesus scourged he washed his hands, forever
clearing the Roman government of the blood of Christ. Now the reader must remember that the soldiers
who brought Jesus from the court of the high priest were Jewish soldiers. They were acquainted with the
Jewish custom of washing the hands to condemn. Hence, when they saw Pilate wash his hands, they
took it for. granted Jesus was to die. Now, how 'can any one fail to see the beautiful chain of divine
Providence running through this whole affair. One might say that this would remove the responsibility of
the actors in this matter. But if a man undertakes to injure you, and by your sagacity you avert the
injury he intended and convert it into a blessing, would that change the guilt of intention by the first
party?
The Rev. Mahan shows it is from the Mechilta that we learn that the Jewish commonwealth was
divided into districts, such as Palestine, Galilee, Judea, and so on. Each of these states had its
courts and legislatures, presided over by a high priest. This is the reason we have so many high priests
spoken of in the New Testament history. These states were sub-divided into smaller divisions, each of
which was presided over by a magistrate who was an officiating priest. If any one will read the Mechilta
he will see clearly the government of the United States of North America; and as the laws of the
Jewish nation were all dictated by the God of heaven, we should appreciate theta the more.
The Saphra, Rev. Mahan explains means, in the Hebrew language, “corner stone or foundation rock,’*
which goes to show that all these laws were founded upon God’s word or authority. This is in the
original manuscript at Byzantium and contains many valuable extracts. He calls attention to another
book, the Siphri, which is more of a chronological and biographical work than anything else, and is by
far the most valuable book of them all. It gives the history of the great events of all of them, and
mentions the name of all the actors of these events, giving a detailed account of the births, lineage,
deaths, as well as all the wise sayings of such men as Abraham, Joshua, Moses, David, Solomon, and
many others. It contains many valuable extracts which Rev. Mahan believes would be of great interest
to the American people, as well as of great benefit to the young and rising generation.
Rev. Mahan At The Vatican In Rome
Besides the books mentioned here, there are others, such as the Besikta and Midrasham which are full
of interesting items, sermons, and extracts of sermons, wise sayings of great men of all ages, the
decisions of the great Sanhedrin on points of law. doctrine, and many other questions of great importance
that would be of deep interest to the reader of this day. These books were all taken from the Talmud
of the Ancient Sanhedrin, which was made at Jerusalem. They were compiled by Hillel the Second,
soon after the destruction of the Holy City, and were made so that if the Scrolls should be destroy^,
they might be preserved in these. After these, other translations were made to answer the necessity
of the Jews in their dispersed condition, such as the Nagad, Kikhil, Midrash, and so on. It should
be remembered that these works were compiled by the Jewish priests from the original. Taimuds, who,
of course, would leave out everything that would have a tendancy to favor the Christian religion. It
should be noted that nothing is found in any of these books about Jesus of Nazareth, but as Rev.
Mahan shows, this doesn’t prove that there are not in existence official records which have been congealed
and were never known until he and his learned associates, Drs. McIntosh and Twyman went to the
Vatican in Rome, and then to the Jewish Taimuds at Constantinople and risked their lives and spent
a big sum of money to obtain. He not only tells you; but he shows you; and the best part of it is that
he proves what he states, and what he shows in this wonderful book of his, is evidence that cannot
be disputed. He produces translations and copies of original manuscripts. He gives dates and names
and tells you just exactly how you can prove these things for yourself. Where you can go and check
up the ancient records if you want to. His remarkable book shows that you must go to the original
Scrolls; if you expect to get the truth. If you wish to find out whether any of the statements made
here are true, read Rev. Mahan’s book and find out for yourself.
The Rev. Mahan invites the reader to go with him and examine and see why it is that none of our
to-called Ancient Historians have never made any mention of Jesus of Nazareth, nor any of the circum­
stances connected with His life. He draws your attention to the history of Josephus, who lived at th*
(Continued on next page)
330 THE de LAURENCE COMPANY
time and place where Jesus, John Baptist, and all the apostles lived. He shows that Josephus, in his seven
historical books, entitled “The Jewish Wars,” gives an account of the sect called Zealots, who wanted
Jesus to go into battle with them as their leader. Jesus spurned them and their offer, telling them that
He came to be a peacemaker and not the destroyer of men’s lives; that he that saved his life by the
sword should lose this life and the life that was to come. He also says that the refusal of Jesus to join
the insurrectionists caused a universal detestation of Jesus among the Zealots and Essenes. They thought
He had power to kill by the exercise of His will, and His non-resistance was finally the cause of putting
Him to death, which they did in a most cowardly and brutal manner.
Josephus’ Twenty Books Show That Lawyers, Doctors, Politicians, And
Statesmen Of The Day, All Students Of The Hillel And Sliammai
Schools, Were Opposed To Jesus And His Followers
Josephus, in his twenty books on the “Antiquity And Customs Of The Jews,” gives
biographical sketches of many of the rulers, priests, and kings of that people. He men­
tions the name of Jesus, making reference to Him in more than fifty places, but does
not contradict the general history in referring to Him. Space will not permit our
giving the quotations. However, the history of Josephus, as published in this country
today, is merely an extract translated from the 1726 Amsterdam manuscripts of Haver­
camp, and Ben Gorion, who was a Jewish Rabbi.
Rev. Mahan goes minutely into every detail. He overlooks nothing; neither does he spare anybody.
This is shown when he draws the reader’s attention to the historian Philo, the greatest of his age. He
shows that there are over one hundred volumes of Philo’s writings still in existence. Philo was a Jew,
and lived in Alexandria. His first work was “The History Of Creation,” in thirty volumes; his second
was on “Sacred History;” and his third the “Laws And Customs Of The Jews.” He commenced his
writings A. D. 40. They were first translated by Simon, a Jewish Rabbi. His works are the most
extensive of all others. He often refers to Jesus of Nazareth; but we cannot make reference to them
for want of space. In 1742 the work by Simon was translated by Mangay of London—two volumes.
Tacitus, a Roman historian, wrote his “History of Agricola” in A. IT. 56. It was first translated by
Marcus, a Jewish Rabbi; and so were all the histories written in this age. They were written in the
languages of those days, and the Scribes of those days were most all Rabbis. They were the lawyers,
doctors, politicians and statesmen of the day, for they were all students of the Hillel and Shammai
schools, which were the most learned bodies of the world. As these were all opposed to Jesus of Nazareth
and His followers, of course they kept everything concealed they could that would advance the cause of
the Christians. This is the reason why we never have had any knowledge of Jesus of Nazareth from the
outside world or from His enemies. After making mention of these former things, the question comes up:
Are these things so? The British Museum has lately acquired a grand addition to their library, con­
taining 128 Volumes of Manuscripts, the writings of great and good men of old. This is enough to start
a few inquiries: Who wrote them? When were they written? How were they preserved so long? The
question also comes up: Why have not. these matters of history been discovered before by our wise
men of former ages? In answer to these inquiries, Rev. Mahan replied that: “The wise men, such as
Dick, Dwight, Watts, Wesley and Clark, and all such, never made any effort to get hold of such docu­
ments.” He defies any man living to show him a man that has made the effort to obtain such a docu­
ment. They, perhaps, like many others, took for granted what the Jewish Rabbis said in their histories,
that all these records were destroyed, burned up in the great Alexandrian library. Another reason was
perhaps this: It may not have been noticed by many that in the year 748 of the Roman Empire and 337
of the Christian Era, Constantine the Third removed his seat of empire from Rome to Byzantium, and
took with him all the records of the Christians to that city, as will be shown in a letter from him in this
book, in regard to having the Holy Scriptures written in manuscript, and having Fifty Volumes bound
and kept on deposit. When Mohammed took possession of Constantinople, he had too much respect for
these sacred scrolls to let them be destroyed, but had them all nicely cased and deposited in the
St. Sophia Mosque. History informs, us of the dreadful struggle that took place between the Greeks and
Romans over the Sacred Parchments in the day of the Crusades; and it would seem that divine Providence
has had something to do in the preservation of these sacred things.
After reading the above statement the reader may ask: How was it possible for these sacred parch­
ments to be preserved so long? Rev. Mahan, in this work, shows that there are hundreds of manuscripts
older than these in preservation. Homer is 300 years older. Why not these, he asks? This able author
shows that the reason why these things have never been brought to the world is that no man that he
knows of has ever made it his special business to investigate these things as he has. He made this his
special business for ten years—corresponding with many historians and scholars, sending for all the books
and records that could instruct him on these great questions; and then engaging two experts, who were
very learned men, namely, Dr. McIntosh of Scotland, and Twyman of England, and going to the city of
Rome and paying their way through the Vatican; and then to Constantinople^ and there going through
the ancient records; thus sparing no time nor expense to acquire accurate knowledge of these things.
No other living man has ever done what the Rev. Mahan did, to go to the bottom of these things and
get the actual facts as they were written in ancient manuscript.
You may say: Did not Gregory the Ninth burn twenty cart loads of these Taimuds? Who says so
besides a Jewish Rabbi? If he did, they were the Talmuds of Babylon, and not those of Jerusalem.
There is no body of Christians stronger adherents to Jesus Christ than the Roman Catholics. Why should
they want to burn the Talmuds of Jerusalem, which were so full of the doctrines and historical events that
are so near and dear to them? No man can go into the Vatican library without a guard over him, who
watch him closely so that he cannot remove a leaf or change a word or letter of anything that is there.
If they would not consent to even the slightest change, it is hardly probable they would burn their works.
Men from all over the world are there. Often when we crossed the Tiber, before it was fairly light,
there were a thousand strangers between us and St. Peter’s gate, waiting to be admitted at the opening
of the gate that leads into the Vatican.
Dreadful Earthquake At The Time Jesus Was Crucified
The Mist That Arose From It Covered The Earth For Three Hours
If more evidence is wanted, here it is. There are at least five hundred quotations made from the
Sanhedrin and Talmuds of the Jews, by men who have denied their existence. Attention is called to
history, and below is given the name, page and other reference necessary. Read for yourself:
First, Rabbi Akiba, a reformed Jewish priest, vol. 1, page 22, quotes from Celsus, an enemy of the
Church. He says there was a dreadful earthquake at the time Jesus was crucified, and that the mist that
arose from it covered the earth for three hours. On page 28 he says that Jesus was the son of Mary; that
he was the founder of the sect called Christians. On page 48 he says that Jesus was crucified on the eve
of the passover. He gives extracts from the apostles, and never denies in a single instance, but admits
their genuineness. He quotes the books and makes extracts from the names they bear. He makes particu­
lar notice of His incarnation, of His being born of a virgin, of His being worshipped by the M.igi, of Hit
(Continued on next page)

flight into Egypt, of the slaughter of the infants at Bethlehem. On page 52 he speaks of His baptism by
John, and the descent of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, and of the voice that was heard out of
heaven. He speaks of the miracles done by Jesus, and never doubts the facts in any instance, but attributes
them to the art of necromancy He had learned in Egypt. But did the reader ever hear of a thaumaturgist
producing the descent of the Holy Spirit, or causing voices to speak from the heavens? Such absurditiet
are not heard of except when they are against the Christian religion.
Aretas, one of the kings of Arabia, who was a philosopher as well as a king, in speaking of the law*
of nature (vol. 7, page 14), says that Jesus of Judea was a philosopher above the laws of nature; that He
controlled all the elements of nature with almighty power; that the winds, thunders and lightnings obeyed
Him; and speaks of these facts as being so common that it would be folly to dispute them.
The Senatorial Dockets At Rome
Justin says, in vol. 2, page 42, that the various governors of Rome in their several provinces made
reports of the important events that occurred in their jurisdiction, and they were spread on the Sena­
torial dockets at Rome. You will find in this same work, page 128, that he appealed to Antoninus and
the Senate for clemency for the Christians, and after referring to their many virtues, and to Christ as their
leader, added: “And that these things are so, I refer you to the records of the Senate made by Pontius
Pilate and others in his day.” “The learned Tertullian, in his Apology for Christianity, about the year 200,
after speaking of our Savior’s crucifixion and resurrection, and His appearance to the disciples, and ascen­
tion into heaven in the sight of the same disciples, who were ordained by Him to publish the gospel over
the world, thus proceeds: ‘Of all these things relating to Christ, Pilate himself, in his conscience already
a Christian, sent an account to Tiberius, then Emperor!’ The same writer, in the same Apology, thus
imates the proceedings of Tiberius on receiving this information: ‘There was an ancient decree that no
one should not be received for a deity unless he was first approved by the Senate. Tiberius, in whose time
the Christian name (or religion) had its rise, having received from Palestine, in Syria, an account of such
things as manifested the truth of His (Christ’s) divinity, proposed to the Senate that He should be
enrolled among the Roman gods, and gave his own prerogative vote in favor of the motion. But the
Senate, without whose consent no deification could take place, rejected it because the Emperor himself
had declined the same honor. Nevertheless the Emperor persisted in his opinion, and threatened punish­
ment to the accusers of the Christians. Search your own commentaries (or public writings), you will
there find that Nero was the first who raged with the imperial sword against this sect, then rising most
at Rome.’ ”—Horne’s Introduction, vol. 1, page 82.
After reading the above, it is fair to ask you this question: If there were no such records there,
would these men have made such appeals? And if they were there, could such things have been forged
and palmed off on the Roman Senate? It seems that to ask the question is enough.
No book in the whole and entire history of ancient religious literature can be com­
pared to this official work by Rev. Mahan. It is' positively the most interesting and only
authentic history of Jesus extant. It is an honest and an absolute translation of Records
and Holy Writings found in Rome as well as in the St. Sophia Mosque at Constantinople,
made by Gamaliel in the Taimuds of the Jews, 27 B. These Holy Writings show that
Gamaliel was sent by the Sanhedrin to interview Joseph and Mary in regard to Jesus.
This noted interview is given in full by Rev. Mahan in his book. There is also given
the report of Calaphas to the Sanhedrin concerning the execution of Jesus, which was
contained in records of the Jerusalem Sanhedrin, by Eliezer Hyran, B. 22. These
records were translated in Constantinople by Rev. Mahan’s learned assistants on October
16th’1883 Eli’s Story Of The Magi
Strange Personages From Egypt, India And Greece
While investigating the Sanhedrin and the Taimuds in Constantinople, October 22nd, 1883, Rev. Mahan
came upon an Ancient Parchment, written and bound between two cedar boards^ This ancient manuscript
contained many strange things. It tells of the three remarkable personages who appeared before the
Sanhedrin, asking admittance to that body. One claimed to from Egypt, one from India, and one
from Greece. These appeared to be the Magi who had been in search for the child Jesus at Bethlehem, and
now had come to make further inquiry. Whether they were required to, or did it voluntarily, is not
known; but they each gave a narrative of his history and experience regarding Jesus of Nazareth. The
Greek slowly, and like one watchful of himself and his words, began:.
“What I have to tell, my brethren, is so strange that I hardly know where to begin, or what I may with
propriety speak. I do not yet understand myself. The most I am sure of is, that I am doing a master’s
will, and that the service is a constant ecstacy. When I think of the purpose I am sent to fulfill, there
is in me a joy so inexpressible that I know the will is God’s.” Here the good man paused, unable to
proceed.
“Far to the west of this,” he began again, “there is a land which may never be forgotten, if only because
the world is too much its debtor, and because the indebtedness is for things that bring to man their purest
pleasure. I will say nothing of the arts, nothing of the philosophy, of eloquence, of poetry, of war. Oh,
my brethren, here is the glory which must shine forever, in perfected , letters by which He whom we go
to find will be made known to all the earth. The land I speak of is Greece.” “My people,” he con­
tinued, “were given wholly to study. Two of our philosophers, the very greatest of the many, teach, one
the doctrine of soul in every man and its immortality; the other, the doctrine of one God, infinitely just.
From the multitude of subjects, about which the schools were disputing, I separated them as alone worth
the labor of solution, for I thought there was a relation between God and the soul as yet unknown. On
this, the mind can reason to a point—a dead, impassable wall. Arrived there, all that remains is to stand
and cry aloud for help. So I did; but no voice came to me over the wall. In despair I tore myself
from the cities and the schools.” At this a smile of delight stole over the crowd.
“In the northern part of my country, in Thessaly,” the Greek proceeded to say, “there is a mountain
famous as the home of the gods, where Theos, whom my countrymen believe Supreme, has his abode.
Olympus is its name. Thither I betook myself. I found a cave where the mountain coming from the west
bends to the southeast. There I dwelt, giving myself up to meditation—no, I gave myself up to waiting;
for what? Every breath was a prayer for revelation. Believing in the God who is invisible, yet supreme,
I also believed it possible so to yearn for Him with all my soul that He would take compassion upon me,
and give me answer.”
“And He did; He did!” exclaimed the Hindoo, lifting his hand from the silken clothes
upon his lap.
The Strangest Story That Ever Came From Human Lips
The balance of this Hindoo’s narration, which is one of the most wonderful and strange
that ever came from human lips, is given in Rev. Mahan’s book. There is also given the
relation of the Greek as well as the learned Egyptian. Nothing that has ever been published
is so intensely interesting as what came from the mouths of these strange men. It covers
several pages of this book and what is related, even on these few pages, is worth more to
the thinking man and woman than anything else to be found in all the literature in the world-

Many So-Called Histories Of Jesus are to a Large Extent based on the imagination of

Remember, that this book is Absolutely Guaranteed to be an Official History. Authen­
tic and Absolutely True in each and every respect. A Translation from the Ancient Parch­
ments and Scrolls at Constantinople and the Vatican at Rome. ABSOLUTELY GUARAN­
TEED TO BE THE ONLY REAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF THE LIFE AND DEATH OF
JESUS IN EXISTENCE.
King Pilate’s “Report Of The Arrest, Trial, And Crucifixion Of Jesus,” is given in full
in CHAPTER IX of this hook.
The very best evidence of the great value of this remarkable book is the book itself.
It contains 350 full pages, which contain the truth and nothing but the truth. It is a work
done by men whose intelligence and honesty are as clean and unspotted as the pages of
eternal truth.
Rev. W. D. Mahan reproduces, in this book, transcripts of letters and other official
papers which show that he actually did go to London and obtained the assistance of two
learned men, and that from the-e he went direct to Constantinople and Rome with the sole
object of obtaining from ancient manuscripts the absolute truth regarding the life and
death of Jesus and to give His history from Bethlehem to the Cross.
It is true many historians have written on this subject, but never before has any man
went himself with assistants who were sufficiently learned in ancient languages, to trans­
late the Parchments and Scrolls at Constantinople and the Vatican at Rome. Many so-
called histories of Jesus are, to a large extent, based on the imagination/ or guesswork of
ambitious writers and would-be historians. These, in the past, have been sold at a high
price to an unsuspectingi public. Again, many books on the life and death of Christ, pub­
lished in the past are worthless because they were incomplete; that is, they were not trans­
lations which gave all the facts. A man may go into store and select from the articles on
display such as he wishes to take away with him. If he only wants certain goods, he will
get them and leave the rest. This is the way some of the so-called histories of Jesus were
written. Their authors took what suited their views and what they wished the public to
know about the real facts of the cruel death of our Savior. Many of these disliked Christ
and were inclined to color their writings with their own personal views and not give the
facts as they found them.
Rev. W. D. Mahan gives the facts as he found them. Again, he at great expense ob­
tained men who were able to perform the task he gave them. He also! spent years of his
life and a great amount of money with the sole object of giving the people of this age the
absolute facts regarding, not only the death of Christ, but to give what was said and
related of Him by His enemies, whether they were Romans or Jews. As stated above, this
book is, itself, the best evidence of its worth. It stands on a pedestal of truth and honor
and there we leave it with the reader to decide for himself whether he wishes, at a small
price, an honest and accurate translation of records made over two thousands years ago.
No copies of it which have been sold have ever been returned as unsatisfactory. Those who
have bought it have! at once notified their friends and advised them to procure a copy for
themselves.

THE BUDDHIST’S CATECHISM OF NORTHERN INDIA.
BY SUBHADRA BHIKSHU
The same contains an outline of the true
and original doctrine of the Buddha Gotama.
This work will interest you.
First, because most every one concerned in
our line of study wants to know who and what
Buddha was that he should be mentioned in
connection with such Great Masters as Christ,
Zoroaster, Krishna and Confucius. Second, you
may wish to know whether any Great Master,
whether he be Jew, Hindu, Japanese or Chi­
nese, ever taught as did the Divine Jesus. Third,
this book is for the education of the student
and diligent inquirer who, knowing so much
about Jesus, also desires some authentic his­
toric facts concerning Gotama, Buddha and the
Buddhist Priests ot Northern India.
Fourth, the great intellect of the Hindus, and
their famous manuscripts, many of which are
in Sanscrit, coupled with their advanced knowl­
edge of the unseen forces of life, death, health
and disease, which has always been the under­
lying force in India, makes this volume deserv­
ing of the highest recommendation.
BUDDHA, CHRIST, KRISHNA, CONFUCIUS AND ZOROASTER.
Buddha the great Hindu, who was the brother and spiritual adviser of man­
kind, was persecuted and misunderstood as was The Master . Jesus. Buddha al­
though persecuted and cursed by those coarse material minds who cared little for
his sublime teaching lived and died a holy man.
He left an indelible impress upon humans which will endure for all time. His
sublime personality, his famous teachings and great example of unselfishness are
worthy of the investigation of all. He like the Master Jesus was a guide, a brother,
a friend, and a true Master to all those whose hearts are sore and heavy laden while
toiling life’s stony paths. Every minute, every hour, every day, every month and
every year millions of souls reverence the memory and teaching of this great soul.
Buddha, the sublime Master, the soul light and cardinal spirit of India, as did
Jesus of Nazareth, and Krishna, and Zoroaster, labored and taugkt because of his
great love for humanity. Each of these great Masters studied the needs of his
followers, and taught according to the age, in which he lived and died. Let any
fair minded reader investigate and he will find that the teachings and principles
of Buddha the magnanimous Hindu, Jesus the faithful Jewish devotee, Zoroaster
the famous Persian, and Confucius the learned Master of the Chinese, and Krishna
are all essentially the same. All these Great Masters, who hav now passed on to
the other life beyond which knows no death, bore a message of love, of hope, and
the conquest of self. True, the teachings of each have been handed down and fol­
lowed by generation after generation.
The name of the Master Jesus has, in the western world become the by-word of the
death bed. The name of Jesus is whispered softly and lovingly by the dying lips of both
Catholic and Protestant. “Jesus saves” has become the spectre of the death chamber. The
name of the Sublime Buddha has likewise become sacred to the Hindu who, even at death,
believes in re-incarnation or birth-renewal.
The teachings of the Master Jesus have been, by many so-called Christian fashion
slaves, money lovers and idolaters misunderstood and prostituted. Millions of souls today
would be better oft if they would have studied the teachings of these great souls, but
instead they have treated them lightly and the result is that they have become relegated
to the ranks of heathen idolaters whose God is money, vainly seeking the truth in the
wrong direction.
However, all this, friend and brother, does not prevent you from following the true
and original teachings of these great souls, who today like the Great Paracelsus, live In
the Astral body. The truth that all these good souls taught will exist forever the same,
for life, and death, and their fundamental laws are unchangeable. This famous book
is one that we certainly need not hesitate to place in your hand or before the eyes of
any worthy brother or sister who may in vain have searched the church and cathedral,
who may have in vain knelt at many shrines for these sacred writings and teachings of
the Buddhists of Southern India, which are now for the first time published by Messrs, de
Laurence, Scott & Co. for the use of those souls in the western world who feel the trying
need of them.

This book is proof that the high reputation of the old Masters, Adepts, and such
Nonconformists as Dr. L. W. de Laurence, and those who are studying the “Text
Books” of “The Congress of Ancient, Divine, Mental and Christian Masters,” is
being well maintained. We can commend this work as a valuable volume on an
obscure subject. It should be given a place alongside of every student’s Occult and
Spiritual books as the subjects of Divination and Demonology are treated historically
and legendarily in detail, and its author has successfully fathomed the mysteries of
Hindu, Hebrew, Arabian, and Egyptian Magic, Divination and Demonology.

THE LIFE

by
Canon Farrar
Jesus addressed those rapt and exalted words to all humanity—to all of us—to you,
on the occasion of his farewell to Galilee. Read on page 402 of The Life of Christ how
He turned a time of permanent separation from His home into a triumph of infinite and
eternal joy. Learn how He “may have lived a life happier, in the true sense of happiness
—happier, because purer, more sinless, more faithful, more absorbed in the joy of obed­
ience to His Heavenly Father—than has been ever granted to the sons of men.”
How Can Jesus Lead You To A Happier, More Successful Life?
It is all in this book. Canon Farrar has written the-classic biography of Christ. His

Mentioned In The Bible And
Gives The Most Comprehensive
And Useful Information, Guid­

tion Of The Teachings Con­

The Bible Is A Great Spiritual
Education In Itself. The Mir­
acles Of Christ Healing The
Sick—Literature, Science, His­
tory, Poetry, Art and Religion
—all are found in it but only
appreciated when properly inter­
preted. No better story was
ever written than the story of
Ruth. Never has the soul of
any poet soared higher in ryth­
mical expression of deep feeling
than that of David. For exacti­
tude and dramatic interest no
history ever written excels the
chronicle of the ancient Jews. “Samuel,” “The Witch Of Endor,” “Jesus Healing The
Sick,” “The Sixth Seal,” Etc., Etc. The Bible is only appreciated by the reader who
understands it, and this best is done with the aid of The Key To The Bible, which
explains the Bible from Genesis to Revelations.
The Book Of Books. The Book Of Books is as a Sealed Book to many and
unless you are aware of .the conditions, under which it was written you fail to under­
stand it. Again, and again, you have come across sentences which puzzle, and refer­
ences which are mystifying. Names of peoples and of individuals are mentioned in
order to get the real meaning of the passage you have read.
For hundreds of years thousands of the greatest scholars in the world have been
studying the Bible, and have investigated all of the other contemporaneous records.
Great expeditions backed by enormous wealth, have explored all of the Holy Land and
have dtig up records in. brick and stone and have gained an intimate knowledge of
the life, habits and customs-of the peoples mentioned in the Bible. Historic Research,
Antiquarian Investigation, the Study of Languages and Dialects and Explorations
throughout The East are objects to which millions of dollars in money and the lives of
thousands of men have been devoted, all for the sole purpose of making the Bible
An Open Book. It occurred to the Editors of The Key To The Bible that from all
the work of the largest and ripest scholarship of the Christian World the best should
be selected and compiled into a single volume which .would serve to unlock the
secrets of the Bible. After years of study.1t' has been completed.

Read This Description!
THE BOOK OF THE DEAD is a collection of Magic and Religious Texts, Formu­
las, Incantations and Rituals intended as a guide and protection in the lower
world. According to the Egyptian religion they gave “the power to have and to
enjoy life everlasting, to give him 'everything he re­
quired in the Other World, to ensure his victory over
his foes, to procure for him the power of ingratiat­
ing himself with friendly beings in the Other World,
and of going whithersoever he pleased and when and
how he pleased, to preserve his mummified remains
intact and uninjured, and finally to enable his soul
to reach the Kingdom of Osiris, or to enter into the
“Boat of Millions of Years,” or into any and every
abode of felicity which had been conceived of by
him.” (Page Ixxxiv) .
“Down From The Tima Of Tha Pyramid*”
Almost all the chapters of The Book Of The Dead
come down from the time of the pyramids, although
a few were part of the earliest collection of funeral
texts found on the walls of tombs, engraved on sar­
cophagi, interiors of pyramids, coffins, and funeral
stelae, papyri and amulets, etc.
The fixed canonical form of 165 chapters was
evolved in the 26th Dynasty.
“Th. Road To Th. Realm* Of Light And Life”
The Book Of The Dead “was very old even in the reign of Semtl, a king of the
First Dynasty, and was, moreover, so long at that time as to need abbreviation, wa>
copied and recopied, and added to by one generation after another for a period of
nearly 5000 years; and the pious Egyptian, whether king or ploughman, queen or
maidservant, lived with the teachings of The Book Of The Dead before his eyes, and
he was buried according to its directions, and he based his hope of everlasting life
and happiness upon the efficacy of its hymns and prayers, and words of power. By
him its Chapters were not regarded as materials for grammatical exercises, but as
all-powerful guides along the road which, passing through death and the grave, led into
the realms of light and life, and into the presence of the divine being Osiris, th«
conqueror of death, who mad. men and women ‘to be born again.’ ”

The Great Christian Mystery
SUPPRESSED by the early Church
Fathers who compiled the Bible, these
Apocryphal Books have for centuries re­
mained shrouded in silence. The nature of
the Apocryphal Scriptures, as well as the
reasons for their rejection by the early
Church authorities have been among the
greatest mysteries of the Christian era.
Astounding Revelations
NOW all mystery and prudery have
been stripped away, and the LOST
BOOKS stand revealed. The Story of
Joseph and Potiphar’s Wife, of Adam
and Eve, of the Girlhood and Bethrothal
of Mary, of the Boyhood of Jesus, in all
their warmth and intimacy and human­
ness glow brightly in the clear white
light of truth. Every Bible student is
entitled to know these rejected records
for they contain many astounding reve­
lations and throw a great light upon both
Old and New Testaments. You may have

“MACCABEES BIBLE’
adlted by the Rev. W. Fairweather, M. A., and J. Suther­
land Black, LL.D. A volume In the monumental Cambridge
Bible for Schools and Colleges. Bound in blue cloth; 271
pages; size 4% x 6% inches.
From the Apocrypha of the Eastern and Roman Cath­
olic Churches, this First Book of Maccabees was published
by the Cambridge University Press as a special study under
The general editorship of A. F. Kirkpatrick, D. D., of the
13th Book of the Apocrypha of the English Bible.
The Introduction to this study of one of the most glam­
orous of the mysterious books of the Apocrypha says that:
Maccabaeus was originally the distinctive surname of
Judas, third son of the Jewish priest Mattathias, and after
his death leader of the war of independence against the
Syrian kings (I Macc. ii. 66, iii. I, v. 24) .... I Maccabees
is by far the most important of the Books of Maccabees.
It records minutely the events of the forty years from the
accession of the Antiochus Epiphanes to the death of Simon
(B. C. 175-135), the most heroic period of Jewish history."
Grimm referred to it as “a record of priceless worth” and
Ewald averred that "it breathes the freshest inspiration of the peculiar elevation of
the time.”

Composed by Reliable Astrologers
This FORECAST is recommended as being the work of one of the foremost and
most reliable groups of astrologers in America. It is a completely full and volumi­
nous interpretation of the astrological significance of your birth date, and in addi­
tion recommendations, covering approximately a year in the future day by day, in
connection with taking action or making decisions or investments in the most im­
portant activities and fields of life.
Knowing Astrology, as you do, you know from past experience that you may di­
rect your way rightly and safely through the path that now seems so forbidding, and
may even avoid it entirely providing you take the right steps under the common
sense age-old laws of Astrology.
This FORECAST is mimeographed on good grade white paper measuring 7 by 10
inches and is bound in such form that you may refer to it constantly for practical
suggestions and guidance in everyday affairs. The recommendations contained in
it will provide you with suggestions for action in all walks of life for at least a year,

of a year a reorder will provide you with information for another year, month by
month and day by day.
Knowledge of these Astrological Aspects which apply to you is no more related
to fortune telling or superstition than is a doctor’s advice. Who can argue away
the fact that countless men and women, prominent in legal, governmental, business,

THE TRUE TEXT
Of Three Books Of The Zohar Of The
ORIGINAL AND SACRED CABALA
In One Volume In English
THE KABBALAH UNVEILED
Containing The Following Books Of The Zohar:
1. THE BOOK OF CONCEALED MYSTERY
2. THE GREATER HOLY ASSEMBLY
3. THE LESSER HOLY ASSEMBLY
Translated Into English From The Latin Ver­
sion Of Knorr von Rosenroth And Collated
With The Original Chaldee And Hebrew
Texts
by
S. L. Mac Gregor Mathers
Believed To Be The “Word Of God”
In Dr. Ginsburg’s article “Essay on the Kabbalah’’
the story of the birth, growth and maturity of the
Kabbalah is told as follows:
“THE KABBALAH WAS FIRST TAUGHT BY GOD HIMSELF to a select
company of angels, who formed a theosophic school in paradise. After the
Fall the angels most graciously communicated this heavenly doctrine to the
disobedient child of earth, to furnish the protoplasts with the means of re­
turning to their pristine nobility and felicity. From Adam it passed over to
Noah, and then to Abraham, the friend of God, who emigrated with it to
Egypt, where the patriarch alowed a portion of this mysterious doctrine to
ooze out. It was in this way that the Egyptians obtained some knowledge of
it, and the other Eastern Nations could introduce it into their philosophical
systems . . . Moses also initiated the seventy elders into the secrets of this
doctrine, and they again transmitted them from hand to hand.
David, Solomon And The Zohar
“Of all who formed the unbroken line of tradition, David and Solomon
were the most deeply initiated into the Kabbalah. No one, however, dared
to write it down, till Schimeon Ben Jochai, who lived at the time of the de­
struction of the second temple . . . After his death, his son, Rabbi Eleazar
. . . collated Rabbi Simon Ben Jochai’s treatises, and out of these composed
the celebrated work called ZHR, Zohar, splendor, which is the grand store­
house of Kabbalism.” (The Kabbalah Unveiled, pages 5 and 6.)

TETRAGRAMMATON TALISMAN
The word “Tetragrammaton” had its derivation in a
Hebrew word, “Yod-he-vau-he”, which signified the un­
utterable name of Jehovah, its meaning being “He that
is and shall be.” The sigil is composed of the letters
formed from the following four texts: Exodus xiii. 2nd
and 10th verses, also verses 11 and 16; and Deuterono­
my vi. 4th and 9th verses. “It was very popular as a
Talisman in the Middle Ages for protection from ene­
mies, also to bring peace, harmony and long life, and
was usually made in the form of a pentacle . . .” (W.
Thomas & K. Pavitt, The Book of Talismans, Amulets
and Zodiacal Gems. London, William Rider & Son, Ltd.
1914. Page 118.) The five syllables of the word “Tetra­
grammaton’’ are engraved in each corner and the He­
brew word Yod, or Shin, is in the center. This talisman
will be sent without extra charge only with a copy of
THE KABBALAH UNVEILED.

Analyzes all Problems
Godfrey Spencer, the Author
of this interesting work,
claims he spent ten years
writing and perfecting his
Numerology System for the
analysis of all problems in
life, and love according to
numbers. He claims that all
problems in life may find a
solution through a careful
analysis of the Birth Number
and in this way by watching
the influences — surround­
ings, one may overcome
many of the obstacles in life
that hold him down.
Win One out of Ten
He claims he studied the
methods of Senchu, Zor-
aster, Pythagoras, together
with many Egyptians, He­
brew and Chaldean Sys­
tems to devise this numer-
ological analysis book
which would serve the
needy of mankind and
bring success in all under­
takings. He claims that the
information contained in
his book makes possible
the solution of one out of
every ten problems.
THE science of numbers is as old as mankind, and the relation of numbers to the lives
of men has been a matter of investigation since the days of the Greek philosophers,
centuries before Christ. It is only recently, however, that this absorbing science has again
been applied to the affairs of men.

MEMORY TRAINING
Intensifying The Retentive Powers Of Memory
Abstract Thought, The Work Of The Higher Forces
MARVELOUS MEMORY DEVICES OF
India, Greece, Rome, And The Middle Ages.
Feats Of Memory At Benares, Madras And Bombay India
The Hindu Method Of Memory Training is a legacy, a gift,
which has come down through the ages from Ancient India and
Egypt. It is now being studied and successfully learned at Madras,
Bombay, Calcutta, and, Benares, India. In fact this wonderful Sys­
tem is known throughout the Orient and has penetrated into the
far east where it is almost worshipped as a God-send by those who
have a poor memory. It is positively the best treatise in book
form today. Tells you the reason why you have a poor Memory and
shows you how to cure it.
Study this book on Memory Training as it is a peer of all
works on the subject. If you have this fine book you will be able
to learn how to control THE HIGHER FORCES OF YOUR MEMORY
so as to perform wonderful feats. A marvelous system of Memory
Training which improves your mental life and strengthens your
mind. Wonderful feats of memory, which would be impossible to
perform without the aid of this marvelous book, are well known.
The Wonders of India are related endlessly by travellers from
the West. They range from the silent Caves of Elephanta, to the
cloud-buried snows of Himavat, to the scent-laden Island of the
Southern Sea, to the Teachers of the fine System for intensifying
the Memory of the Abstract Mind.
Weird And Wonderful. The very name of Mystic India, with its long descended lines
of Expert Teachers of a Marvelous Memory System who, by virtue of their Wonderful
Mind Training, have been Initiated into all the highest and most potential of Nature’s
Mental Secrets, is itself suggestive of Strong Mental and Memory Powers, and few there
are who have glanced superficially at this subject, or read from the periodicals of today
relating to it, who do not regard India as the birthplace of all that is Mysterious, Weird
and Wonderful in the Spiritual and Mental side of man’s Nature. The Master Teachers
for the improvement of Human Memory, owing to their intense meditation and practice
of Mental Concentraton have long ago discovered the Secrets of Strengthening the Mind
as well as the Retentive Powers of Memory, all of which are strange and wonderful, and
by which can be produced phenomenal memories. The invincible tendency of the Hindu
to develop the Art of fixing the Mind and Memory upon Seven or Eight different things
at once, so as to understand and use at will the imponderable resources of the human
brain, have in consequence made them able teachers of a Wonderful Memory System.
With their fine penetrating eyes—eyes which reflect the wisdom of a thousand years—
and which bear ample witness to their Marvelous Memory. They can simultaneously
keep in mind and do several different things at one time. Their renown is immortal, the
custodians of remarkable Memory Devices which make them in every respect of Wonder­
ful benefit to the western seeker after Memory Powers. Their teaching and Power of
Mind embrace feats of Memory which appear impossible to any person not having studied
their fine system of Memory Training.
Marvelous Memory Systems Of India. In fact they have attained the highest Pinnacle
of success in the Development of the Retentive Powers of Memory and their Methods have
never before been published or presented in one book. Their Powers of Memory and Meth­
ods are really amazing and will amply justify any person in sending for an’d obtaining at
our reduced price, this remarkable Book on Memory Training. It teaches how to perform
wonderful feats of Memory. Many have been impressed by the Marvelous Memory Systems
of India; that Gorgeous and Mystic Land of the East; for in the shade of its Palm Groves,
in the depth of its Caves and Jungles, in the wild recesses of its Mountains, and behind
the walls of its Temples and Lamaseries there are concealed many Secrets which deal
with the practical improvement of the Human Mind and Memory. It should be remem­
bered that the Hindus possess Scriptural as well as Monumental Records dating back to
the Highest Antiquity, even, to Pre-historic ages.

A PRACTICAL TREATISE ON
THE ART OF CONJURING
BY PROFESSOR HOFFMANN
‘•THE SCARCITY OF TREATISES ON ‘WHITE MAGIC’,” says Professor Hoffmann in his
Introduction to MODERN MAGIC, “is easily accounted for. The more important secrets of
the art have been known but to few, and those few have jealously guarded them, knowing
that the more closely they concealed the clue to their mysteries, the more would those
mysteries be valued. ... At the present day the secrets of the art are not so well kept;
and there is hardly a trick performed upon the stage which the amateur may not,‘at a
sufficient expenditure . _ . procure at the conjuring depots.”
TEACHES YOU HOW TO PERFORM TRICKS
Most of the books devoted to the subject of conjuring confine themselves to telling how
a trick is done, but few of them teach one how to do it. MODERN MAGIC is an outstanding
work in this respect, for it not only explains most of the tricks in use today, but actually
teaches the reader HOW to perform them successfully.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The following quotations from the Table of Contents are especially interesting and
reveal the wide scope of this book and the tremendous amount of information and instruc­
tions it contains:
General Principles of Sleight-of-Hand Applicable to Card Tricks; Card Tricks with
Ordinary Cards, and Not Requiring Sleight-of-Hand; Tricks Involving Sleight-of-
Hand, or the Use of Specially Prepared Cards; Card Tricks Requiring Special
Apparatus; Principles of Sleight-of-Hand More Especially Applicable to Coin
Tricks; Tricks with Coin Without Apparatus; Tricks with Coin Requiring Special
Apparatus; Tricks With Watches; Tricks With Rings; Tricks With Handkerchiefs;
Tricks With Dominoes and Dice; The Cup and Balls; Ball Tricks Requiring Special
Apparatus; Hat Tricks; Stage Tricks; Clairvoyance; Spiritualism; Parlor Magic.
SIMPLE LANGUAGE—COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS
MODERN MAGIC explains and teaches as indicated above although the quotations can
give no adequate idea of the completeness of this work. In fact, leading magicians place
it at the head of all available books on the subject. No one interested in “White Magic”
can well do without this volume. Thousands of them have been sold to the complete
satisfaction of the purchasers leaving no doubt that MODERN MAGIC is the standard and
most popular reference work in the field.

The Sphinx Mind-Reading System
Marvelous Second Sight Mystery
Which Has Perplexed The World
Exhibited Before The Royal Heads Of Europe
Kammerstein’s Roof Garden, New York; Auditorium
Hall, Chicago; And Egyptian Hall, London, England.
First Introduced To The Theater-goers Of Marvel-Loving
Paris As The Trance Of Venus. Positively SuccessfulIn Each
And Every Crucial Test, Whether Given On The Stage Or In
The Parlor. The Most Puzzling Effects In The Whole Domain
Of Mind-Reading Or Second-Sight.
PRODUCES THE GREATEST DRAMATIC EFFECT
It Is All Done Very Rapidly And Without One Single Failure To The Complete
Bewilderment Of Spectators. Its Artistic Effect Puzzles Every One. A Most Remark­
able Second-Sight Mystery. Can Be Developed And Used By Anyone. Convincing
Tests Can Be Given In Public Or Privately Within One Hour After You Possess This
Mysterious Sphinx Mind-Reading System.
Audience Spell-Bound. A very small amount of time devoted to this Sphinx Mind-
Reading or Second-Sight System, enables any person, of ordinary intelligence, to
develop sufficiently to give an exhibition of their ability as a Mind-Reader. Many are
able to give a startling exhibition of their power within one or two hours after receiv­
ing this famous method, which seems, to spectators, to be all but supernatural, and
the one who has this System, which has never failed to hold the largest audience spell­
bound, is looked upon as possessing marvelous clairvoyant powers.
Exhibited Before The Royal Heads Of Europe. It is a positive fact that only a
very few possess this secret, and exhibitions were recently given before all of the royal
heads of Europe. Large audiences being entertained at The Queens Hotel, Chelten­
ham, England; The Imperial Hotel, Torquay, England; and at the Assembly Rooms,
Bath, England. The audiences, in these places, were held spell-bound by the dramatic
effect produced by the exhibition of this great Second Sight Mystery. The above state­
ment is authentic, and absolutely official, as we hold positive evidence, in our office,
showing that this famous Sphinx Mind-Reading System was exhibited throughout
Europe, during the year of 1907, by one who has gained an international reputation.
Exhibited At Hammerstein’s, Auditorium And Egyptian Halls. The same system
has held large audiences at such famous amusement places as Hammerstein’s Roof-
Garden, New York; Auditorium Hall, Chicago; Egyptian Hall, London, England; and
many other places where public performances are exhibited. Any person sufficiently
interested can have any of the above statements verified if they wish, as we have no
desire to enlarge upon this claim, it being only necessary to give the actual facts as
we know them to be.
Charge For Teaching From $250.00 to $2,000.00. After witnessing the marvelous
exhibition of this infallible Mind-Reading System, there were many who naturally of
course, wanted to learn it. The charge for Teaching it was from $250.00 to $500.00,
and we understand that many paid as much as $2,000.00; because there is no such a
thing as failure, if you carry out the instructions sent with it. The Sphinx System has
been perfected and so simplified that it can be mastered thoroughly, without difficulty.
When we state that this System, when exhibited in Europe and America, held an
audience spell-bound, and go on record as being in a position to prove every word of
it, it means a great deal in these days of cold business facts. The phenomena produced
at once became doubly impressive owing to the fact that it was both bewildering and
unfathomable. Some of the greatest critics in the world have attempted to explain it,
but nobody, except the initiated one, can do so. However, as stated above, it has been5
reduced to an exact science, and is positively successful in each and every crucial test...

Introduced In Paris As A Trance Of Venus. The Sphinx Mind Reading System, or
Marvelous Second Sight Mystery was first introduced to the theater-goers of marvel
loving Paris, as The Trance Of Venus, where it produced the most puzzling effects in
the whole domain of Mind-Reading and Clairvoyance. All Paris went wild over The
Sphinx System. So weird and impressive was the scene. The Seance-room being hung
with sombre draperies, and illuminated with wax lights, in massive Silver Candle-sticks,
which were arranged about the Mind-Reader in a misty Triangle and Pentagons.
Of Arabic Or Egyptian Origin. What took place in Paris, when this System was
shown there, also happened in Vienna, Austria; Bombay, India; and other places in
the world. One observant wizard claiming that it is the same system used by the
Tibetan Mahatmas of mysterious India, who, by their exhibition of supernatural powers,
held the admiration of the world. Others claim it to be of Arabic or Egyptian origin,
and associated with the Egyptian Rites of Free Masonry. If the student will educate
and develop himself in the “Sphinx System,” he will no doubt, attract as much atten­
tion as any of the above mentioned operators.
One Operator Presented With A Diamond Studded Watch. This marvelous Second
Sight System, after being exhibited throughout the world, has made for itself a life-long
reputation. At an exhibition given in Europe, the operator was presented with a mag­
nificent Diamond Studded Solid Gold Watch by the audience who witnessed his won­
derful feats of Mind-Reading. The one possessing this System cannot only become
famous, but wealthy, if they will give their exhibitions in a professional and business­
like manner.

in Divination by Numbers were wont to place great confidence in The Wheel Of
Pythagoras, which resolves questions by Arithmancy, or a species of sortilegy by num­
bers, wherein the result depends upon the unfettered agency of the mind and will, or
intent to know “any difficult thing.” The Wheel Of Pythagpras is said by ancient
writers to resolve “all questions the asker may wish to be acquainted with, whether of
the past time, the present time, or of the future.” The following are a few samples of

Pythagoras was a famous Greek Philosopher of the Sixth Century B. C. His system of
philosophy was taught his followers at Crotona in Magna Graecia. The Copernican Sys­
tem was first evolved and taught by Pythagoras. His great advance upon the teachings
of the Ionian school was in the central idea that number is the essence of all things and
the principle rational order in the universe. The leading theological doctrine was Metem­
psychosis. The conception of the Copernican System of Astronomy has also been credited
to the Pythagoreans.
Winchell’s Science And Religion, Page 57 (H. 1877), Says: “PBcetas, who taught the
axial revolutions of the earth, and Ecphantus, who taught the same, were . . . .
Pythagoreans, and there was a revival of Pythagoreanism in the century before Christ."

Wheel Of Pythagoras
Invented In The Monastic Solitude Of The Middle Ages
TOMES IN THE DEAD LANGUAGES
The Wheel Of Pythagoras is divided into Four Compartments, the upper half of
which contains in order the Numbers which are termed Propitious, Good, and For­
tunate; the lower half contains those .Numbers of a eontrary kind, or those which are
termed Evil, Unpropitious, and Unfortunate. Around the Wheel are the letters of the
Alphabet, tq which are placed certain corresponding Numbers which are required in
the calculations (these will be explained only to those who obtain The Wheel Of
Pythagoras). The Numbers in the right half of The Wheel are said to denote “Long
Time,” or that the affair in question which has these' Numbers in the working will be
quite a long length of time in being brought about; and those in the left half of The
Wheel are said to signify a short or brief space of time ere the affair is accomplished.
Next follow the Tables Used In Working The Wheel And The Mystical Numbers of
each. Day in the Week. Next follows the Numbers of the Planets ruling the Days and
these in turn are followed by The Numbers to be chosen by Chance (as will be fully
explained to those who obtain The Wheel) in working the Questions.
Invented In The Monastic Solitude Of The Middle Ages. The Numbers attributed
to the days of the week, and of the Planet ruling the day, are of very ancient origin.
They are, as well as The Wheel Of Pythagoras, a creation o*f former traditional fore­
knowledge by lots or numbers, and were invented, like Geomancy, in the monastic
solitude of the Middle Ages. The Ancient Manuscript from whence this is compiled
appears to have been written as early as the fifteenth century.—It was purchased at a
very high price by L. W. de Laurence.

Talismans And Amulets In The Bible
Phylacteries And Signet Rings Of Ancient Egypt
PHYLACTERY
SIGNET RINGS OF ANCIENT EGYPT EGYPTIAN AMULETS
Genesis 41 :42 Genesis 35 :4
In the Old Testament
called Frontle. Certain
passages of the Penta­
teuch were Inscribed on
slips of parchment and
inclosed in a leather
case; were bound to the
left arm, and sometimes
to the forehead. The
Pharisees made them
conspicuous to attract
attention to their piety.
Matt. 23:5, H. 116.
A universal belief in the efficacy of Talismans and Amulets has prevailed among the
people of every nation in all ages of the world. The Holy Bible tells of the Seal Ring
and how it was used as a Talisman. Genesis 41:42 mentions over twelve Signet Rings
which were worn as Talismans in Ancient Egypt. An Ancient Egyptian Necklace Was
composed of fine gold Inlaid with genuine Red Coral, while on this page are shown the
Egyptian Amulets mentioned in Genesis 35:4 and the Phylactery mentioned in the Old
Testament which were made of Virgin Parchment and upon which were inscribed certain
passages from the Pentateuch. The Pharisees wore these Phylacteries as a Talisman which
they bound to their arms and foreheads.
In Ancient times, so relates the Bible, Signet Rings, Phylacteries (Talismans) and
Amulets were in universal use, owing to the people's infallible belief and faith in their
efficacy.
That this same belief prevails today, is evidenced by the fact that many have wonderful
faith in what they believe the efficacy of a Talisman or Amulet; for they are worn
secretly by more people than the ordinary person supposes. Tradition and Ancient His­
tory have caused many today to have great respect for a Talisman. The Old Testament
Phylacteries, Talismans, and Amulets, as well as the Signet Rings of Ancient Egypt,
shown above, are an exact reproduction of those which appear in the Bible. In fact,
many of the Old Hebrew Manuscripts, when translated into English, contain a great
deal regarding Amulets and Talismans as well as Seals. These things are also mentioned
In the Egyptian and Hindu Kabalas. According to Old "World Magic a Talisman should:
be traced on Parchment and worn secretly under the clothing or about the body.
From The Standard Dictionary. The following from the Standard Dictionary confirms
the above statement. Phylactery. 1. A charm or amulet worn on the person. Spedf.i
(1) Among the Jews, a strip or strips of cowhide parchment Inscribed with passages of
Scripture (Ex. xiii, 2-10, 11-17; Deut. vi, 4-9, 13-22) and enclosed In a black calfskin
case, having thongs for binding it on the forehead or around the left arm in memory
of the early history of the race and of the duty to observe the law, or sometimes to
serve as an amulet. See Teflllln. (Standard Dictionary).
Belief In Talismans Against Disease Or Misfortune
Belief in Talismans Is coeval in age with the world. Extensive research shows that
this belief dates back to the early history of man. The tribes of Israel, the Chaldeans,
The Grand Zoroastorian Nation, and the Hindoos; all believed in the Talisman as a
harbinger of good fortune and proof against misfortune. This belief is found in both
the Hebraic and Christian Bible. Appolonius, a philosopher of the 1st century, per­
formed certain things by the use of Talismans and we find that Justin Martyr, the
Roman Historian, and a Greek father of the church in the 3rd century, in speaking of
Apollonius and his Talismans says: “How is it,” asks Justin Martyr, in evident dismay
“How is it that the Talismans of Apollonius have power in certain members of creation
for the prevent, as we see, the fury of the waves, and the violence of the winds, and the
attacks of wild beasts; and whilst our Lord’s miracles are preserved by tradition alone
those of Apollonius are most numerous, and actually manifested in present facts, so as
to lead astray all beholders?” This perplexed martyr solves the problem by attributing
very correctly his efficacy and potency of the charms used By Apollonius to his profound
knowledge of the sympathies and antipathies (or repugnances) of nature. (Justin
Martyr: “Quaest.,” xxiv.
History shows that the Ancients had great belief in Talismans against desease or
misfortune, especially when the Talisman was reproduced on Genuine Parchment which
was clean and unspotted. The wearer of a Talisman, however, so history tells us, must
possess an infallible hope, and have constant faith in the Talisman, and have his mind
lifted up to higher influences if results were expected.
•The Phylacteries, Amulets, Signet Rings and Talismans of the Bible show that these
were in universal use, and that the Pharasees wore Phylacteries as a Talisman which
they bound to their left arms and forehead.

Popularity Of Lucky Charms
DUE TO THE GREAT WAR
“Ki-Magi” Good Luck Talismans
Society’s Latest Fad
The following is reproduced from the Progress Herald, London, of November, 1914. It
refers to the use of Charms and Talismans during the Great War of that date, and is Inter­
esting because it tells of the Remarkable Escapes from Dee.th by soldiers who carried
Charms and Talismans.
“Belief in the powers of ‘Lucky Charms,’ ‘Talismans’ and other mysterious, intangi­
ble ‘amulets’ that come from the Far East seems to be rapidly increasing. In ancient
times, to scoff or disbelieve in the powers of these Lucky Charms (which are supposed
to have been blessed and prepared by the High Priests according to their ancient for­
mula) would bring a chain of misfortune upon the doubter or scoffer. The Great War
seems to have brought these ‘Ki Magi’ Talismans into greater popularity than ever
before, probably on account of the remarkable escapes from death of many Indian sol­
diers who carry them. How far this fad has spread from the soldiers to the officers, and
from officers to the nobility of Great Britain and other countries can only be realized
when we learn that such names as Queen Alexandra, Lord Avebury, Lady Kinloch-
Cook, etc., are mentioned as being the possessors of and believers in Good Luck Charms.
One cannot help but believe that there must be some good in these Ki-Magi Charms,
and to ridicule the idea may indicate lack of knowledge of the Occult. Practically every
human being is superstitious in some respect or another. There are those who are
superstitious about Fridays; others about the number ‘13,’ and still others who carry
a rabbit’s foot, a four-leaf clover or a pocket coin for good luck. An amusing story is
told about a well-to-do business man of New York who never believed in such ‘trash,’
as he called it. One day, however, in searching for some important papers in his pocket
book, he accidentally dropped an old faded card, which upon closer examination proved
to be the ‘nine of hearts’ from a pack of playing cards. It was amusing to note the
blush on this stern business man’s face when he had to admit with a smile that he had
carried that card on his person for over 20 years, and attributed his good fortune to
this, his talisman.
“The genuine ‘Ki-Magi’ Charms are very rare; practically all of those in existence
being in the possession of an old curio-dealer . . . who for a number of years has
been industriously collecting them from all parts of the globe.”—From The Progress
Herald, November, 1914.
Charms Next The Skin
The following *Is reproduced from the London Daily Mall of January 26th, 1915. It
refers to the Charms and Talismans found upon Prisoners of War taken by the English.
“In a skeptical and materialistic age like the present, it is somewhat surprising to
find reliance being placed on Charms. And yet not a few of our prisoners are in posses­
sion of so-called ‘prayers’ which are really written Charms against Death, Wounds,
Disease, and every Imaginable Evil. Che such document recently found on a prisoner
begins thus: A powerful prayer, whereby one is protected and guarded against Shot
and Sword, against Visible and Invisible Foes as well as against all Manner of Evil.
‘May God preserve me against all manner of Arms and Weapons, Shot and Cannon, long
or short Swords, Knives or Daggers, or Carbines, Halberds, and anything that cuts, or
points; against Thrusts, Rapiers, long and short Rifles, Guns, or such-like which have
been forged since the birth of Christ; against all kinds of metal, be it iron or steel,
brass or lead, ore or wood.’
“After further circumlocution the list goes on to include ‘all kinds of evil reports,
from a blow from behind, from Witchcraft and Well-stealing (poisoning?);’ but, curiously
enough, it omits the only mischance which actually befell the owner—that of being
made a prisoner of war. The document is of inordinate length, and ends with some
Cabalistic Letters and Numerals and with an obscure reference to a ‘blessing upon the
Archangel Gabriel.’ Many of these Amulets or Charms are probably of very ancient origin
and have been handed down among the German peasantry from generation to generation.”
—London Daily Mail, January 26th, 1915.
Do You Wear A Lucky Charm?
Remarkable Escape From Death Of An Indian Soldier In France
"The Mysteries of the East are once more occupying the minds of the European
savants, and everyone is talking about the wonderful and unheard of good luck anl
magic escape from death of a Sikh soldier, who is now recuperating in one of the hospitals,
from several trifling wounds. It appears that although he was in the very thick of the
battle and bullets whizzed by him by the hundred, he was able to avoid them as if he
possessed a charmed life. A correspondent who interviewed this soldier has, after a
great deal of persuasion, discovered to his amazement that the only thing to Which
this Sikh attributes his escape, is not his skill or his ability, but to a small Amulet or
lucky Talisman called the ‘Ki-Magi,’ which he had been wearing round his neck ever
since he was a boy, as the harbinger of good fortune and a proof agarnst the evil eye
or ill omen. These ‘Ki-Magi’ Amulets are rather rare in this country.

BELIEF AND FAITH IN TALISMANS, AMULETS
AND PRECIOUS STONES IS COVEAL IN AGE WITH THE WORLD
By L. W. de Laurence
The origin of Talismans and Amulets is lost in the ob-
acurity of the ages, but as far back as we can trace human
records they are to be found. The terms Talisman and
Amulet have become from indiscriminate use to be considered
synonymous.
/ “The meaning of these two words, however, is entirely
distinct. Talisman being the conception in the Arabic tongue
nrA of th6 Greek, meaning the influence of a Planet, or the Zodiac,
f / $D upon the person born under the same. A Talisman in olden
y | times was, therefore, by its vary nature a Sigil, or Symbolic
Figure, whether engraved in Stone or Metal, or drawn upon
genuine Parchment or Paper, and was worn both to procure
( love and to avert danger from its possessor. The latter pur-
pose alone was the object of the Amulet, its Latin significa-
■’ty vJ being t0 d0 away with, or baffle, its root being Amalior.
Book OfAncient Talismans Pliny, cites the word as the country-folk name for the Sycla-
men which ought to be planted in every human home, because where it is grown poison­
ous drugs have no power to harm, on which account they call it the flower, Amuletum.’
Belief in Talismans and Amulets is Coveal in age with the world, and Faith in Ancient
Religious Symbols, Divine Names and Sacred Inscriptions has survived the ages. With
the growing knowledge of finer forces opening up new Mental, Spiritual and Occult
Powers to mankind and to which we are slowly coming into touch, many people are pre­
pared to admit that there may be some active power in a thought made concrete in the
form of a Talisman or Amulet which may be made for some specific purpose, or for par­
ticular wear, becoming to the wearer a continual reminder of its purpose and undoubtedly
strengthening him in his alms and desires.
Symbols, frequently of a' Religious Nature, have formed the basis of Talismans and
Charms from earliest times, holding a very Important place in .the affairs of humanity,
for Symbolism was a power before civilization was evolved, and by its recognition of a
certain order in physical affairs it was undoubtedly a great factor in the establishment
of human laws. In modern Religions this law is recognized by the use of each Symbol
in accordance with the character of Ceremonial Worship, Color also playing a very
Important part in the service.
From remotest times, back even to the birth of humanity, Precious Stones and Talis­
mans have been held in high estimation by all nations; the former, primarily because of
their beauty, and the latter on account of their virtues, as transmitters of Good Luck
and to avert misfortune. The association of Gems with Power, Civil and Religious, has
ever been noticeable; and to the fascination of antiquity may be added the allurement of
mystery. Moreover, of the many and varied signs of wealth and luxury, jewels have
played a most important part in the lives of the great, not only on account of their beauty
but because they contained in a small compass the equivalent to a large sum of money
and in times of danger could easily be concealed and carried from place to. place.
As Tokens or Symbols they conveyed joy and confidence to their owners, and were
thought to give warning of Coming Events, Inspiring Courage and Faith in the fearful,
and the romances and tragedies in which they have played a part, together with their
marked influence on the lives of individuals and nations, Intensifies our interest in them
so that it is little wonder that Faith in the Mysterious Properties ascribed to them should
have survived the growth of ages and still find so many believers in all countries. The
Philosophers of thousands of years ago, understanding their suitability as a medium for
the transmission of Astral Forces and Vibrations, Invested them with much importance,
attributing to them Spiritual as well as Material Powers, Special Characteristics and
Medicinal and Curative qualities.
In all probability Gems had their origin In the very remote period of the Earth’s
history when it was still in a molten state subject to deluge and fire, before its solidifica­
tion made it possible for vegetation to appear, and the translucent lustre of certain Gems
Is due to the action of the floods which preceded the fiery volcanic period. The coloring
which forms their greatest fascination Is due to various metallic oxides in combination
with oxygen which in varying quantities gives Red, Blue, Yellow, or Green colorings,
as shown by the Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Topaz and Amethyst. It Is most difficult to
determine with any certainty in what country Precious Stones were first worn as
ornaments, but the consensus of opinion seems to point to India, as far as recognized
history is concerned, as their birthplace, for every rare and beautiful production of
Nature, Gems, Diamonds and Pearls are associated with the Orient and The Far East.
The earliest records of humanity do not, however, stop with known histories, for
traces of man’s love for Gems are found in the discoveries of travelers and the traditions
of South America, evidence proving an inheritance from past civilizations of great
antiquity. There is an innate attraction to the marvelous in mankind, the Imagination
leading us to endow the rare and precious with peculiar qualities, particularly when the
source of its beauty and rarity is not readily perceptible. It is akin to the extraordinary
Magnetic Influence which one person may exercise over another without any tangible
evidence of super-physical powers, or the Mysterious Attractive which the Magnet exer­
cises over Iron, and establishes the inference that other minerals may be similarly en­
dowed with properties at present unrecognized by our ordinary physical senses.
Confusion and doubt have arisen as to the exact stones mentioned by the early
writers, owing to their elastic methods of describing all Red Stones as Rubies, all Green
Stones as Emeralds, and all Blue Stones as Sapphires; this confusion has not been
lessened by reason of the complexity of the many languages of the East, to say nothing
of the artistic liberties taken by modern poets and authors, (who. probably unaware of
the necessity for Astronomical or Astrological knowledge as a basis for the Zodiacal
placing of the stones,) have taken our Calendar as it stands for the Month stones with
such embellishments as their fancy dictated.
The Precious Stones ascribed to the Twelve Months of the year, were those worn in
the Breast-plate of the High Priest Aaron and it was believed that the Divine Revelations
ebtained by the shining or dullness of the stones in the Urlm and Thummin, due to some
virtue, inherent in them, were indicative as to whether the Atonement had been accepted
or not. These Twelve Stones, engraved with Twelve ..Anagrams of the name of God,
had a Mystic Power over the Zodiac, harmonizing the Twelve Angele and Geed Mpirite
who had affinity with the Twelve Tribes ef Isratl.

TALISMANS ON PARCHMENT PAPER
There are many who have tested the worth of Talismans, and their rreat appreciation
and belief in Talismanic operations are on a par with the unlimited fondness of the
ancients for these mysterious ag-ents from the laboratory of nature, as they are said
to be, by those writers of ancient manuscripts treating upon the subject of Talismanic
Magic.
The extraordinary interest which has recently been taken in Talismans by men of
science and genius has become very manifest. Flushed with their success, derived from
wearing Talismans which they believe infallible, and, having procured results from
their effects, many are today taking advantage of the opportunity offered here to secure
Eight Famous Talismans on Parchment absolutely FREE by sending an order for one
of the Fine Black Cobra Grain Talisman Cases shown on another page.
Any number of Talismans on Parchment Paper, ean be carried in a Leather Talis­
man Case wlhere they will remain clean, pure and unspotted. No one should be allowed
to touch or see your Talismans. This method is adopted by the natives of India, Africa,
all Oriental and many European countries. As to the invocation, the act of making a
Talisman on Parchment Paper is an invocation. Faith does the rest. A number of
Talismans may be worn at the same time.
Some time ago there was published a history of the famous Rothschild Talisman,
which is an heirloom, and on the possession of which the fortune of the family is
believed to depend. It is in the form of a small gold casket, about the size cf a snuff­
box, but the secret of its power lies hidden in words inscribed within. Napoleon was a
great believer in Charms, and wore upon his body a Talisman given him by one of the
Priests after the Nile Expedition. Talismans are largely in use on the Continent, by
Arabs, Persians, and Hindoos, while in Africa, among native tribes, the Obeyah is much
in repute. Captain Welby reports that in Abyssinia he discovered races of giants who
inhabit the devil-possessed district of Walamo. He was a victim of the magical power
of the Walamo, and “was quite unable to explain the cause of this mysterious busi­
ness.” These people use magical powers, and no Abyssinian can approach the tribe.
In other countries we have instances of bewitching, and the magical power of the “evil
eye.” The maker of Talismans relies also upon the Magical Properties of Numbers and
of Geometrical forms as is taught in “The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic
and East Indian Occultism,” by de Laurence. To those 'are added words having power,
and as by the Word the Universe was created, certain forces in Nature spring into activity.
For it is not words that stir a man to anger, pity, cr love, but the spirit that ensouls
the words, so teaches de Laurence, the greatest Mystic alive today. The Kabalist uses
such seasons for his work as are in agreement with the purpose; and effects happen
from configurations of the planets. Therefore, all that is done under good influences
comes to good effect, whether by sigil, charm, or talisman; it is effected by faith of the
operator, aided by will and imagination. Imagination is the creative power of the
mind by which a mould is delivered to Nature for the reception of the vitalizing ele­
ment of the will. For the imagination is receptive, while the will is projective. What in
common operates as desire, the thought taking form and the desire giving life to it, in the
mind of the magician is replaced by an ardent imagination and conscious will directed
to the creation of definite ends. And to this extent all lovers, poets, artists are magi­
cians equally with makers of empires and reformers of the world. Only when art fixes
form and voice to the powers which reside in Nature is their efficacy brought within
the control of the human will, as powder and shot which have been wrested from the
earth and fashioned to a purpose, de Laurence says: “The Power Of The Will and the
intention of the soul is the main point in magic as in medicine. A man who wishes
everybody well will produce godd effects. One who grudges everybody all that is good,
and who hates himself, may experience on hie own person the effects of his poisonous
thoughts.”
THE BIRTH OF AN INFALLIBLE ETHIC.
Having been purified and brought out of ehnoo, dogma will give birth naturally to an
Infallible ethic, and the great order of Truth for future generations will be constituted
on this basis.
Religious systems and creeds, which are, now in warfare, are dreams of the twilight;
let them pass. The sun shines and the earth follows its course; distracted is he whs
doubts that the day is coming when hidden truths will appear.
Distracted also are those who say that Occultism Is only a dead tree trunk, and that
they must put the axe thereto.
The dlo not sea that beneath it* bark the living tree at hidden truth 1* ranavred
unceasingly.
Truth has no past and no future) it is eternal) it is not that which ends; it is man’s
foolish dreams only that have an end.
The weapons, which will destroy religious dogmas, foolish eults, and orthodox
creeds are in the hands of Truth, as the knife-of a pruner, and the dead branches—
religious superstitions and dogmas—will alone be lopped from the tree of everlasting
Trust and Wisdom.
It has been the sole purpose of de Laurenee, who is the greatest writer and teacher
of hidden truth now living, to demonstrate, that, at the beginning, the Symbols of
religion were those also of hidden mysteries, and Occult forces, which ars now in con­
cealment.
May religion and universal Truth, reunited In the future, give help and show lovs
one another, like two brothers, for theirs has been one cradle.
The common people will become Initiated in hidden truths by toil, and by faith Is
self (God), and Eternal Wisdom.
There will always be those that disbelieve these things, as there will be children always;
but when those who have haith in self (God), endowed with wisdom, shall become s.
mother to the people, the path of personal,' successive, gradual emancipation will be open
to all, and he that is called will thereby be enabled through his own efforts to attain
the rank of the elect. This is the mystery of the present age, which antique initiation
concealed in its dark recesses. The hidden powers of Nature, which can be mads sub­
ject to the will of man, are reserved for the elect to come.
The crook of the faithful student of hidden mysteries shall become the rod of mira­
cle*; it was so in the time of Mose* and of Herme*; it will surely be so again.
The mighty *ceptre of the Magnua will be that of the true follower of Eternal Truth;
and that person will by right be first among men who shall have Shown himself greatest
of all in knowledge and in virtue. True Magic, at that time, wlllbe no longer an Occult
science except for the ignorant; it will be one that is incontestable for all.
Then, as de Laurence has so faithfully taught in his wonderful works, THE GREAT
BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC AND EAST INDIAN OCCULTISM, and THE
MASTER KEY, his latest work, which teaches Scientific Concentration, shall Universal
Revelation re-solder one to another all links of its golden chain; the human epic will
close, and even the effort* of Titan* will have served only to restore the altar of the
true God.

THE SINGULAR PROPERTIES OF NATURAL MAGIC.
ANCIENT VIEW OF CHARMS AND TALISMANS.
Ij the secret laboratory of nature, there are many singular compositions of unseen
forces which have a surprising effect in themselves, without the least assistance from a
materialistic agency; for in the compounding of forces of a similar nature there is a two­
fold power and virtue; first, when these unseen forces are duly disposed into any material
thing, such as a Charm or Talisman; and, second, when from certain mixtures and com­
positions of herbs and minerals.
All this proceeds from the Occult affinity of natural things amongst themselves, by
the force and sympathy of which many astonishing effects are produced.
In THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC AND EAST INDIAN
OCCULTISM, by de Laurence, the student finds many surprising examples of the power
invested in sympathy and antipathy, by means of Images, Talismans, and Amulets, com­
pounded of nothing more than natural ingredients; and de Laurence very particularly
describes, in his wonderful book, many infallible methods by which certain effects can
be worked by the use of certain secret Charms and Talismans.
There are multiplied instances and histories, both at home and abroad, of those who
know that natural things being fitted to the times and constellations, compounded of
sympathetic ingredients will, and do, produce strange and apparently supernatural effects.
Since the Occult (hidden) causes are appropriate to the effect, a few of these we
will mention further on.
However, as every Occult student knows, it is in tlhe simple operation of nature that
many wonderful things are wrought by the use of certain Talismans, which, upon a
superficial view, appear impossible or supernatural. Indeed, many other strange and
uncouth magical operations might be here described, and as the Hindus have the ability,
as shown by de Laurence in THE GREAT BOOK ON MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC AND
EAST INDIAN OCCULTISM, of effecting such astonishing things by the medium of
Images, Charms, Talismans and Amulets, so the Asiatic nations have the faculty of pro­
ducing similar Occult effects by similar rites.
It is astonishing to human comprehension, what surprising effects they are capable
of producing upon the person they intend to persecute, torment or punish, and for which
reason we have spared giving the minutia here of forming these execrable images, lest
the evil-minded and malicious should attempt thereby to work some spell, or abominable
species of revenge upon their unsuspecting neighbor.
Many there are who have been eye witnesses of these singular proceedings which are
little known in the world, and neither kings, rulers nor emperors can obtain them unless
they study seriously books by such great writers as Paracelsus, de Laurence, Levi, Franz
Hartmann and Agrippa.
Those students who have studied de Laurence’s books, thereby learning the singular
Occult properties of nature as well as those things which proceed from the Occult affinity
of natural things amongst themselves, by the force and sympathy of which numerous
strange effects are produced have had many surprising examples of the power invested
in sympathy and antipathy, by means of Images, Talismans, Charms, and Amulets, com­
pounded of nothing more than natural ingredients.
Many there are today who are able to remove disease, and to perform many surpris­
ing cures at a distance from the patient, even without ever seeing him; so, by a similar
property in the sympathy and antipathy of nature, certain leaves, roots, or herbs being
rubbed upon warts or excrescences, and buried under the ground, remove or cure the
same, which experiments take effect according to their mediums, and their consumption
or putrefaction in mother earth, of which the human source is principally compounded.
The art of Transplantation is also magical, and was formerly much practiced. How­
ever, as all these strange things are to be found most fully written on, by de Laurence in
THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC AND EAST INDIAN OCCULT­
ISM, we shall say that there is much that can truthfully be related regarding Talismanic
learning and Talismanic belief, the wonder of Charms, Amulets, potent Spells, and, curious
Secrets in Occult Philosophy; just as there could be much written of the composition of
The Magical Candle, The Magic Torch, The Magical Oil of Grapes, The Circle of the
Theurglc Art, The Effect of Enchantment, Causes and Effects, Tile Ancient Theurgists,
and their potent—Talisman Against Enemies, their—Terran Talisman For Love, their—
Talisman for War and Battle, their—Ancient Danish Calendar, which was formerly used
as a powerful Charm throughout England during the early part of the last century, hav­
ing been inherited from the Danish Government in England. It was called by them
“Rimstock,” from “Rimur,” which, in their language, signified “a calendar.”
We shall next proceed to speak of "The Sleep of Plants,” the “Urim Thummiih,” of
the German Alchemists of the seventeenth century. The composition of the Electrum
Magicum, the very same being in a rare Secret Manuscript, now in the hands of de
Laurence, that has never been made public; neither has the use of this famous secret
and hidden mystery.
As stated above, much could be written regarding potent Talismans and the singular
Occult properties of Natural Magic, and, much could be said here of “The Magic Bell" for
Invoking Spirits, and The Perpetual Lamp of the Ancients, but as yet these are hidden
mysteries to be divulged only to the faithful.
Egypt and India are the cradles of Occult Mysteries and of Wisdom; for their masters
teach more exactly and more purely than any other. Joseph realized in Egypt the dream
of communion; he established the priesthood and the state as sole proprietors, and thus
sole arbiters of labor and wealth.
It is common knowledge that his elevation was due to skill in the interpretation of
dreams, a science which even devout Christians refuse to credit, though they recognize
that the Bible, which narrates the wonderful Divinations of Joseph i® the word of the
Holy Spirit.
The science of Joseph was none other than a comprehension of the hidden mys­
teries of nature (God).
Joseph well knew that the soul, when immersed by sleep in the Astral Light, per­
ceives the reflections of its most Secret Thoughts and even of its presentiments: he
knew further that the art of translating the Hieroglyphics of sleep is the key of uni­
versal Soul-Sight, seeing that all intelligent beings have revelations in dreams.

TALISMAN NO. 101. (Figure XX-1)
For Discoverers Of The Most Hidden Of Secrets
This Is Indeed a Most Ancient Seal or
Talisman. The very same was taken from
an old book venerable with age and a
noted treatise on the Rites and Mysteries
of Goetic Theurgy, as well as the Rituals of
both White and Black Magic as practiced by
the ancients of the old world.
A curious inscription reads as follows:
“The reason why this venerable Talisman is
much sought after, is the belief that the
one who carries it concealed about his per­
son will receive impressions regarding hid­
den secrets, and to be able to penetrate,
into mysteries and things unseen by the
physical eye.” There is an ancient belief
that this curious Talisman, when placed
under one’s pillow at night, that their secret
enemies and many things which are going
to happen will be shown in a dream. In
fact some call this the Dream or Vision
Talisman. Be this as ic may however the
belief in this Talisman is wonderful.
TALISMAN NO. 102. (Figure XX-2)
The Fourteenth Table Of The Spirits Of Success
This is a reproduction of an Ancient
Talisman taken from an Old Book of Spirit
Arts which is now venerable with age. This
same book was translated from Manuscripts
written and used by an Ancient People.
A curious inscription reads as follows:
“The Spirits of Venus, The Goddess of Love,
Good Will, and Affection. It is believed
makes one beloved and respected and hon­
ored in all affairs of the heart, and in all
conditions where true love and affection
exists. Much will be made known, regard­
ing the one you love, secretly through
dreams. Venus was believed to assist and
be helpful as to prosperity and benevolence
between loved ones. This Talisman repro­
duced in Gold Ink on Genuine Virgin Parch­
ment, made from the skin of a lamb, and
carried upon the person: so an Ancient
Book States, will be fair to the wear.”
The Spirits of Venus: the Goddess of
Love, should ever guard the worthy of both
sexes and contribute to happiness and con­
geniality between loved ones. Away with
strife.

TALISMAN NO. 103. (Figure XX-3)
Talisman. Love. Riches. Against Enemies.
This is indeed a most Ancient Seal or
Talisman. The very same was taken from
an old book venerable with age and a
noted treatise on the Rites and Mysteries
of Goetic Theurgy, as well as the Rituals
of both White and Black Magic as prac­
ticed by the ancients of the old world.
A rare inscription reads as follows:
“Persons many times during their existence
cannot fail to be in a condition of. utter
bewilderment to see that by means of a
Pact or Covenant with either good or evil
spirits one can discover the Grandest Se­
crets of nature which are hidden from the
eyes of all men living in the physical body
whose inner or spiritual sight is not devel­
oped.
It is to the Clavicle of the great King
Solomon, says the Grimoire, that we owe
the discovery of the genuine method of
making Pacts with Spirits, which he also
made use of himself for the acquisition of
his immense riches, for the pleasure of
such innumerable women, and for the rev­
elation of the most impenetrable arcana of
Nature, whereby every species of good and
evil may be accomplished. Having deter­
mined to make a Covenant or Pact, contin­
ues the “Grand Grimoire,” you must learn
all that is possible about the ancients who
had an infallable belief in the efficacy of
charms and Talismans.
This Talisman, No. 103 (Figure XX-3),
whose history is lost in the Night of Time,
has always been much sought after by peo­
ple who have not considered the labor and
study requisite to fathom the Mysteries of
Magic: always believing that their study
would not be expended in vain. Even some
of those who did not believe in these things
could not deny the possibility or even the
fact that such learned and gifted men as
King Solomon, Eliphis Levy, Edward Kelly,
the famous Alchemist who, according to
Weavers (“Funeral Monuments,” 1631, pp.
45, 46), was associated in many Conjurations
with Paul Waring.
Referring again, without apology, to this
famous Talisman No. 103 (Figure XX-3),
which was known and respected in the age
in which King Solomon and other famous
men of great spiritual enlightenment lived,
it may be added that: It is so stated, “that
the old ancients whose Occult, Spiritual and
Esoteric teachings have been handed down
even unto the present day from generation
to'generation, had great faith and belief in
this particular Talisman. Their belief was
that this Talisman No. 103 (Figure XX-3 >
would make the one who wore it concealed

about his person, fortunate, and it is said
that they also had great belief in this Talis­
man for making anyone who had injured
them very unfortunate. That is to say that
it was believed that the one who wore it
would be fortunate and that the person who
did anything against the one who wore this
Talisman would be unfortunate. There also
prevailed the belief that Talisman No. 103
(Figure XX-3) could be used to stir up the
flame of love in another whether it be male
or female: also for success of petitions and
the obtaining of -a thing denied or taken, or
possessed by 'another.” Indeed much is
written regarding this particular Talisman
and this much more may be added: “That
those ancients who believed in the old
Cabala had a firm belief that Talismans
would protect them iagainst all mischief of
evil spirits and men, especially if the very
same were reproduced in gold ink on virgin
parchment made from the skin of a dead
born lamb.” Protection against failure in
love affairs.
TALISMAN NO. 104. (Figure XX-4)
Black and White Magic by the Ancients
This is indeed a most Ancient Seal or
Talisman. The very same was taken from
an old book venerable with age and a noted
treatise on the Rites and Mysteries of
Goetlc Theurgy, as well as the Rituals of
both White and Black Magic as practiced
by the ancients of the old world.
A strange inscription reads as follows:
“When that which Spirits utter is just,
there is no felicity. When that which
Spirits do is equitable and true in mode,
there is no sin. Injustice is the death of
moral being, as lying is the poison of intel­
ligence. The false and lying Spirit is there­
fore the Spirit of Death. Those who harken
to him become his dupes and are by him
poisoned. Epicurus was a Greek Philos­
opher (50-125). His followers believed in
the doctrine that pleasure is the chief good.
Therefore, Epicureans on their part, de­
manded the formula of Magic and the
recipes of Occultism so that they might en­
joy forever and suffer nothing at all. In
this case the science itself intervenes and
says, as religion also says: “Blessed are
those who suffer.” But that is the reason
why the Epicurean has lost faith in re­
ligion. “Blessed are those who mourn,” but
the Epicurean scoffs at the promise. The
interested reader should now listen to what
has been found to be true by experience
and by reason.”
Sufferings test and awaken generous
sentiments; pleasures promote and fortify
base instincts. Sufferings arm against
pleasure; enjoyment beg'ets weakness in
suffering. Pleasure squanders; pain ingar­
ners. Pleasure is man’s rock of peril; the
pain of motherhood I» woman's triumph.
Pleasure fertilizes and conceives, but p:un
brings forth. Woe to him who cannot and
will not suffer; he shall be overwhelmed by
pain. Nature drives unmercifully those who
will not walk; we are cast into life as into
an open sea; we must swim or drown. Such
are the laws of Nature as taught by Tran-
scendant Magic.
And now, reader, you should consider
carefully whether any one can exercise
spiritual powers so that they can perform
wonderful things and enjoy life without
first devoting much time to patient study
and silent meditation. The true disciple of
Magic and Occultism knows from the bot­
tom of his heart, like the Sages of Israel,
and the faithful believers of Islam: There
Is No God but God. For the initiates of true
Occultism, this signifies that, “There is but
one Being and this is Being.”
Why seek to deny that which you cannot
understand? Does the dreadful form of per­
sonilied evil only prompt you to smile?
Have you not heard the ceaseless sobbing
of the surging masses of humanity which
writhes and weeps in the crushing folds of
the monster evil?
Have you never heard the atrocious
laugh of the evil spirit who is persecuting
the just man?
Jerusalem, murderer of its prophets and
prostituted over and over again to the false
Assyrian and Babylonian gods, ended by
losing in turn the Sacred Word, when a
Savior, declared to the Magi by the holy
Star of initiation, came to rend the thread­
bare Veil of the old Temple, to endow the
souls of earnest disciples with a new net­
work of Legends and Occult Symbols_ _
ever concealing from the profane, and al­
ways preserving for the Disciple that truth
which is the same forever.
Let the beginner know that: “Nothing
which is hidden is lost, but at the same
time nothing that is found is absolutely
new. Again, that the seal of eternity is
affixed in the souls of all men. That profa­
nation has befallen the doctrine of Occult­
ism, Spiritism and Magic we have no inten­
tion to deny; repeated, and handed down
from age to age, the misuse itself has been
a great and terrible lesson for those who
made secret things unwisely known.
Tradition and Ancient History
A universal belief in the efficacy of Tal­
ismans and Amulets has prevailed among
the people of every nation in all ages of
the world. The Holy Bible tells of the Seal
Ring and how it was used as a. Talisman.
Genesis 41:43 mentions over twelve Signet
Rings which were worn as Talismans in
Ancient Egypt. An Ancient Egyptian Neck­
lace was composed of fine gold inlaid with
genuine Red Coral. There are many Egyp­
tian Amulets mentioned in Genesis 35:4.
The Phylacteries mentioned in the Old
Testament were made of Virgin Parchment
upon which were inscribed .certain passages
from the Pentateuch. The Pharisees wore
these Phylacteries as Talismans which
they bound to their left arms and foreheads
or concealed about their person. In Ancient
times, so relates the Bible, Signet Rings,
Phylacteries (Talismans) and Amulets were
in universal use, owing to -the people’s in­
fallible belief and faith in their efficacy.
This same belief prevails today among the
highest and the lowest of every people.
Tradition and Ancient History bring to
these Sacred TaliBfnans the Occult student's
veneration and highest respect.

Seventh Table of the Spirits of Divine
Wisdom
This is a reproduction of an Historical
Talisman. It is believed that wherever
human inquiry begins, human error will be
introduced in greater or less proportion.
Contradictions merit the charge of injustice
or dishonesty. Those highly deserving of
credit as to the main and the important
facts of life are found by the immutable
laws of nature to be the subjects of esteem
and respect. This is the first and purest
source of sacred erudition. Some live in
the dark . perplexities of heathen supersti­
tion. Some desire Spiritual Knowledge and
Spiritual Treasures. These are of marvel­
lous worth. Nature checks with terrible
exactness. Man is confronted with the sol­
emn truths of Scripture and the tremendous
certainty of Divine Judgments.
The fulfillment of the Lord’s prophecy
respecting Jerusalem and of earlier predic­
tion setting forth the lamentable events
which would attend to final apostacy of Is­
rael, was predicted by Josephus.
Now, those who wish to perform Divine
Works and be favored by the kindness of
providence, should study the actions and the
character of Jesus Christ. Therefore, this
Talisman has been reproduced in Gold Ink
on Genuine Virgin Parchment, made from
the skin of a lamb, and in view of the fact
that it is an exact reproduction of an His­
torical Talisman, the one who carries it
upon his person and desires to follow in th®
footsteps of Jesus, will be favored by a
good Angel, which will keep him from
error and sin so that he will become th®
subject of Divine Grace and Spiritual En­
lightenment, and never merit the charge
injustice or dishonesty.

TALISMAN NO. 107. (Figure XX-7)
This Ancient Talisman was taken from
an Old Book. A curious Inscription refer­
ring- to it reads as follows: “Uvall, The
Forty-seventh Spirit is Great, Mighty, and
Strong. He speaketh the Egyptian Tongue,
but not perfectly. His office is to procure
the Love of Woman, and to tell Things
Past, Present, and to Come. He also pro-
curetih Friendship betwieen Friends and

of Powers. He woverneth 87 Legions of
Rjirits.”
TALISMAN NO. 108. (Figure XX-8)
Bad Influences and Rebellious Spirits
Tills is indeed a most Ancient Seal or
Talisman. The very same was taken from
an old book venerable with age and a
noted treatise on the Ritexs and Mysteries
of Goetic Theurgy, as well as the Rituals
of both White and Black Magic as prac­
ticed by the ancients of the old world.
A very curious and mysterious inscrip­
tion reads as follows: “There are certain
magic words as well as ancient Talismans
which have come down to us through the
ages of time. There are also potent words
which, if rightfully spoken, are said to
enable one to declare his desires aloud.”
As stated above this Talisman is an
exact reproduction of one which appeared in
an old book venerable with age. There­
fore, any Talisman reproduced from a trea­
tise on the Rites and Mysteries of Talis­
manic-Magic has been much sought after,
for among the ancients the Talisman like
this one was believed to keep one from
harm, especially if worn or carried upon
the person. There are others, so we read
in this old book, that believed that this
particular Talisman was able to protect its
wearer against bad influences and rebel­

SEAL No. 18363. This famous Sea! was taken
from that section of “The Sixth And Seventh
Books Of Moses” which contains “The Arcan
Bible Of Moses.” A curious inscription reads
as follows: “The SCHEMHAMFORAS will en­
able the person who carries it to be a partaker
of Divine Influences; make one beloved in all
respects. If a man wears this Seal in bed, he
will learn what he desires to know through
Dreams and Vision. The Spirits will also assist

will give Power and Wisdom to rule over Evil
Spirits and learn the Bibliis Arcanum Arca-
norum, which means, Mystery Of All Mysteries.”

“The Sixth And Seventh Books Of Moses.” A
curious inscription, referring to Azielis, reads as
follows: “AZIELIS is a very prompt TREAS­
URE SPIRIT of the earth and of the sea. He
appears in the form of a wild ox, and any
person carrying this Seal should not compro­
mise with Evil Spirits; for all this power, and
word of might, which Moses, Aaron and Solo­
mon, used according to the revelation of God,
are sufficient to compel the Spirits to reveal the
Treasures of the earth and sea, and to give
them to you without harm or deception.”

made in this adver­
tisement are not

is claimed is that
these Seals and In­

curious inscription, referring to Arielis, reads as
follows: “ARIELIS is a serviceable Spirit, and
appears in the form of a dog. He commands
the lost treasures of the land and sea, which
have been lost or secretly buried, and any per­
son carrying this Seal should not compromise
with Evil Spirits; for all this power, and word
of might, which Moses, Aaron and Solomon,
used according to the revelation of God, are
sufficient to compel the Spirits to reveal the
Treasures of the earth and sea, and to give
them to you without harm or deception.”
SEAL No. 18366. This Seal was taken from
“The Sixth And Seventh Books Of Moses.” A
curious inscription, referring to Marbuelis, reads
as follows: “MARBUELIS appears in the form
of an old lion. He delivers the treasures of the
water and the land, whether buried secretly or
hidden in caves, and assists in obtaining all Sec­
ret Knowledge and Honors. Any person carry­
ing this Seal should not compromise with Evil
Spirits; for all this power, and word of might,
which Moses, Aaron and Solomon, used accord­
ing to the revelation of God, are sufficient to
compel the Spirits to reveal the Treasures of
the earth and sea.”

Review By The British Medical Journal, London, England,
Highly Appreciated By Users As A Wonder Worker
The following is the full text of the Review of our world-wide ‘‘Talisman,’’ published in the BRITISH
MEDICAL JOURNAL, London, of the 19th of March, 1921:
We have received from an I. M. S. officer a delightful business circular issued in all
seriousness by a native firm in Calcutta, advertising a “Talisman” which they manu­
facture. We quote from the circular: “By its use (by its use means simply wearing it
round the neck, waist or arms) one will be free from all disease, all will be blessed with
success in everything and in every act. It prevents untimely death and early decrepitude.
A man is sure to get rich within the shortest possible time whether he is engaged in
service, commerce, trade, arts, etc., if he prefers to wear one of the wonderful Talismans.
It is sure to make him happy and blessed by surrounding him with a merry group of
healthy children and beautiful and faithful wife.” The testimonials printed are even
more ingenious than this exordium. In every case the full name and address of the
writer is given. One gentleman writes: “Allow me to tender my heart-felt thanks for
the good that your Talisman has done to me. I passed this year under great difficulties
the L.L.B. examination.” Another: “After the use of your Talisman my uncle, Mr.
------------ - of ------------- Hospital has received Honours from the Government.” An official:
“On the very next day on wearing your Talisman my pay was increased by 100 Rs. The
effects are wonderful.” Another official: “I cannot find words to express the efficacy of
your Talisman. My circumstances in pecuniary matters were really bad, and there has
been marked improvement.” Health is improved as well as the pocket. One gentleman
in an official position writes: “I derived much benefit from your Talisman, which cured
insanity of my wife, who was suffering from it for the last 15 years. Send another.”
Another official: “Your wonderful Talisman has completely cured my son from all dis­
ease. He looks now in colour like lotus flower and strength like Bheema.”
Note. _ The review by The British Medical Journal, presented above, is reproduced from a circular
printed in India, This circular is now on file in our office.
What Influential People Say About This Talisman
The Testimonials published herewith show that this Sacred Talisman, from the Holy
Sastras, has been used in India, Africa and throughout the Orient by those who believe
in its efficacy to help them ward off disease and also to recover from it. It is bought in
India, so these Testimonials show, by people who wish to use it as a Talisman against
dangers and difficulties. Again, we have on file in our office in printed form, almost Two
Hundred letters of Testimony from influential people stating that this Talisman has
helped in Examinations; that it is a good Talisman for Health, Wealth and Happiness;
that it is well thought of by many Government Officials in India. Among the Testimonials
published on the following pages, are some very sincere ones from Captains, Engineers,
and Municipal Officers, Health Officers, and Doctors. There are also several Testimonials
from Clergymen, Judges, Magistrates, and Munsiffs. The commendation of this Talisman
presented in these letters of Testimony seems to be true. We do not guarantee it but
believe it to be correct.
It must be a marvellous Talisman indeed, that it should receive Testimonials from
hundreds of people in all walks of life.
Postal, Telegraph. and Railway Officers have written their testimony and com­
mendation.
Chiefs, Advocates, Barristers, and Vakils of High Courts, testify over their own
signatures that they have found it useful: that it has helped them: that its effect
was indeed magical.
Hundreds of others say they have derived benefit from the use of this Talisman.
A noted Official of a High Court, writes: “I got three Talismans from you last
year and handed them to some relatives and strange to say that they reported
RAPID PROGRESS IN BUSINESS.”
A Gold and Silver Smith of Ceylon, India, writes: “Your Talisman did every
success. The Doctor told us our boy would pass away soon. We remembered your
Talisman and tied it on him. After four hours we found he was not suffering as
before and he got quite better afterwards.” This remarkable Testimonial came from
Natal, South Africa.
A Government Official of Barhatta Mymensingh, India, writes: “I have been wear­
ing your Kavacha Talisman for the last three years and I am glad to inform you
that it has been giving me miraculous effect on my fortune.”
Health, Wealth and Happiness seems to follow it as sure as a shadow follows the
ox that draws the plow.
Read this from Mr. F. Travas, Assistant Foreman of the B. B. & C. I. Railway
Machine Shops at Lower Parel, -------------, India. He writes: “During the use of
your Talisman I have derived great benefit, both in fortune and in health.”
A Government Pensioner of-------------, India, writes: “The Talisman you supplied
me last year had a very healthy effect.”
Another well known business man of Rangon, India, writes: “Your Talisman gave
my family a great deal of usefulness and they are getting richer and richer. I can
strongly recommend your Talisman.”
This Man Says It Is One Of The Seven Wonders Of The World
A Notary Public of C-------------, which is one of the largest cities in India, writes: “Eight
months ago, an intimate, friend of mine gave me your Kavacha (Talisman). I am really
astonished to tell you the marvellous effects of it. It is indeed one of the seven wonders
of the world. I must admit that I have had very good luck since using your Talisman.
I WAS THE LUCKY WINNER OF Rs. 20,000 from a lottery. It perfectly cured my dis­
ease from which I was suffering for many months. In fact it saved my life from drown­
ing by its divine power. Even my friend who gave me the Talisman PASSED THE
CAMBRIDGE Senior Local Examination with Four DISTINCTIONS and First Class
Honours. This is a marvellous Talisman indeed. It has given me all the virtues as put
forth by you. I thank you cordially for your Talisman. I have the greatest pleasure in
recommending it to any one who is desirous of wearing it. Send me 6 more,”
' (Continued On Next Pass)
396 WORLD RENOWNED KAVACHA TALISMAN
“It prevents all poisons whether due to infectious diseases, bad water and atmosphere
or any other causes, from entering' into the body. If any poison by some means or other
enters the body—by its use, it will soon be driven out with excreta and urine. Therefore
during all epidemic of plague, cholera, influenza, or small-pox, it is THE PROTECTOR.
In malarious places if this great Talisman is used, one is sure to be free from any illness
whatever. In short by the use of this wonderful Kavacha one will always be blessed
with sound and perfect health and long and happy life.
“Therefore all men and women, boys and girls, both young and old, should not lose a day
but at once use this great Talisman. As lightning conductor saves all buildings, churches,
temples and big places from the lightning, so does this Kavacha save a man or a woman
from all evil effects, due to diseases or circumstances.
“By its use one will surely meet with success in Horse Races, in litigation, in examina­
tions, and in all other things. It will Bestow honours from Government and will secure
a handsome, beautiful and auspicious wife. By its use one will be able to be the favorite
of all.
“FOR WOMEN. This noted Talisman is the greatest blessing. If it is worn by women
they are sure to be very lucky. By its use all women will be auspicious, sweet voiced
and sweet tempered and will be blessed with handsome children if they are sterile; in
fact they will be the glory of all household making all happy, healthy and wealthy.’’
NOTE. The Hindus in their advertisement say that this World Renowned Talisman
Sarvavijaya Kavacha is obtained from a Sacred Temple which is located hundreds of
miles in the interior. They also state that the Sanskrit Sloka, which we have printed
above, was not composed by them, but that it is quoted from the Holy Sastras, and that if
any person can prove that this Sloka is not quoted from the Hjoly Sastras, they are pre­
pared to pay him at once a reward of 500 Rupees.
The Sastras contains the Brahminical institutes of laws, letters, and religion. It also contains the Four
Vedas and the Six Vedangas as well as the Six Sacred Books of Ancient Hindu Philosophy, believed to have
been written over Two Thousand years ago.
The above statements, which are enclosed in quotations, are not guaranteed. They
have been reproduced from a circular which is printed in India and contains almost two
hundred Testimonials regarding this noted Talisman. We have reproduced these Testi­
monials on the following pages, word for word. We believe these Testimonials to be
genuine as the name and address of each person is given in the circular in which this
Talisman is advertised. In our reprinting of these two hundred Testimonials, we have
given the name, but deleted the address of the person giving the Testimonial. The
reason we have not printed the address is that these names and addresses many times
are copied by ambitious advertisers who annoy these good minded people who have in all
sincerity allowed their Testimonial to be published, by sending them cheap literature.
When a name is given without an address, this is impossible. Again, many times people
who allow their Testimonial to be published are annoyed by receiving letters asking non-
sensible questions, either regarding themselves or why they give a Testimonial. A man
who once allowed his Testimonial to be published with his name and address, received
over five hundred letters asking all kinds of questions. Had he of answered them,—it
would have taken him several weeks and cost him hundreds of dollars in time, stamps
and stationery. If the name and address of a person giving a Testimonial is published,
it is no sign that they should be annoyed by receiving hundreds of letters from strangers;
for it is considered to be extremely presumptuous as well as showing a lack of good
taste for any person to write to a stranger asking personal questions regarding a Testi­
monial or the circumstances which caused him to give it.
No person can read the Testimonials published here without being impressed with the
great sincerity and expressions of truthfulness by those who wrote them. Indeed, these
Testimonials show that hundreds and hundreds are really enthusiastic over the beneficial
results which they believe they have received by wearing one of these Talismans. It is
true, of course, that in the Orient and throughout Europe Talismans are much more in
vogue than they are in America. However, it is not to be supposed that Government and
Court Officials, as well as Doctors and Clergymen would write Testimonials such as are
printed on these pages, unless they are thoroughly satisfied and greatly pleased with the
results received from wearing this famous Talisman.
First Introduced Into America By de Laurence
This World Renowned Talisman, Sarvavijaya Kavacha, is much sought after in India
and the Orient where it is sold to all classes of people as the Testimonials published here­
with show. Some of them were imported and sold in America. A lady bought a Gold one
and later purchased two more to give to her relatives. This World Renowned Talisman
cannot be bought from this firm for money. IT IS ONLY GIVEN AWAY FREE WITH
ORDERS FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT. Full particulars regarding how you can RECEIVE
IT FREE if you send an order FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT from this catalogue, is given
on another page. You positively must read this page carefully and make out your order
as stated.
Not Sold For Money
As we have had so many requests for a Talisman of this kind by our customers, we have
decided to give them away free with orders.
Facts Regarding This Talisman. This Talisman can be worn on a chain around a ladies’
or a child’s neck. It can be worn on a gentleman’s watch chain. It can be fastened under­
neath the clothing next to the body. It can be worn by a baby, a child or an adult of
either sex. The wearer should keep it on him constantly and it should only be removed
when clothing is changed. It is positively not sold for money; but is given away FREE
WITH ORDERS AS EXPLAINED ON ANOTHER PAGE.
Do Not Send Any Money For This Talisman. We have had hundreds of offers of money
for one of these Talismans and could sell them at a very high price, but it is absolutely
useless for any person to try to buy one of them from us. We have bought these Talis­
mans for the sole purpose of giving them free with orders to our customers as we believe
that there are many who will greatly appreciate the fact that they can now obtain them.

"GOOD LUCK CHARMS”
WHAT THE "TALISMANS” ON THE "MASCOT” MEAN
WHEEL CROSS—The Cross between two Circles was used on the shields of soldiers as a
protective and preventive "talisman." It is also connected with warding off the Evil Eye.
The Circles relate to the Power and Glory of the Sun, and the Cross within them to pro­
tection from harm.
SERPENT—From time immemorial the serpent has been the symbol of Health and Vitality,
and has been sacred to the Great God of Medicine because of its ability to cast off its
skin and apparently renew its youth. As it is long lived, it represents the principle of
longevity and vitality especially when depicted with its tail in its mouth. The coiled
snake also typified Eternity. It figures prominently in the principal religions of the past
and present, and has been used as a talisman for Knowledge, Wisdom, and Under­
standing.
SEAL OF SOLOMON—An omnipotent "talisman," this sign was worn in many forms for
protection against all harm, injury and danger and from evil "influences" and "powers."
Of the two triangles of which it is composed, the one pointing upward stands for Good,
the one pointing downward for Evil; it pictures fire and spirit. Love, Truth, and Wisdom.
The manner in which the triangles are interlaced represents the triumph of spirit over
matter. It is said to be used as an amulet against fever and disease.
SIX—The Love Number, sign of Venus, Goddess of Love and Fertility. It is widely be­
lieved that those who cherish some embodiment of the Six principle will be in a favorable
condition in connection with the emotion of Love. On the "MASCOT" the Seal of Solomon
has six points which relates it to Venus, and the Fertility principle of the Sun does
likewise.
HORSESHOE—Because of its resemblance to the crescent, the Horseshoe has been
regarded very widely as a Good Luck amulet, and since it is always made of iron, is
considered protection against the Evil Eye, that metal being potent for the purpose.
ROUNDED CROSS—This is a most popular luck bringer but it is necessary that the hooks
turn to the right in imitation of the path of the Sun. The symbol resembles the Circle,
sign of the Sun, with a Cross in it.
FOUR-LEAVED CLOVER—An extremely popular charm for Good Luck because:
"One leaf is for fame.
And one leaf is for wealth
And one for a faithful lover,
And one to bring you glorious health
Are all in the four-leaved clover."
DEUCE OF CLUBS—To those interested in games of chance, lotteries, etc., the Deuce of
Clubs is adopted as being the "talisman" of the pack.
SIGN OF MARS—The God of War and Victory is symbolized in this manner. His influence
is said to stimulate men to mighty deeds and great valor and to give them an iron will.
Mars was associated with the worship of Venus, Goddess of Love.

everyone is said to be influenced

and are illustrated above. In order from left to

ARIES, the first sign (the ram's horns) governs the
period from March 21 to April 19.
TAURUS, the Bull, rules from April 19 to May 20.
GEMINI, the Twins, from May 20 to lune 21.

SUN’S DISC—A world-wide "talisman," the Sun's Disc is held to be the symbol of the
Source of Life, of Fertility and Abundance, and in ancient times was worn for Power and
Fame. It is the sign of new life, resurrection, and eternity.

power; it is said to be worn to acquire Knowledge, Power, and Plenty. It is closely
allied with Venus' Fertility principle and her symbol is derived from it. Some authorities
hold that the Ankh Cross represents male and female anatomy. Egyptian Christians are
said to have adopted it as equivalent of the Cross of Christ and it is believed to have
meant to them the Life Everlasting.
LATIN CROSS—In the Dark Ages the Cross was considered a symbol of Good Luck and
its religious associations have made it popular for exorcising so-called "Evil Spirits."
Oriental Christians evolved the Cross with three cross pieces and it is so represented on
the "MASCOT".
SEVEN—The Number Seven is so universal in the signification of Good Fortune as to
require little explanation. It is referred to widely as a primordial quantity and is insep­
arably coupled with Success, Fame, Good Luck, etc., etc. 7

Famous Five Pointed Star Pentagram. This is the same
Sign which the Peerless Paracelsus proclaimed to be the
GREATEST AND MOST POTENT OF’ ALL TALISMANS. It
is the same Sign Of The Pantagram which de LAURENCE,
the greatest living Mystic, elucidates in his wonderful work,
“THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC AND
EAST INDIAN OCCULTISM.” This PENTAGRAM has always
had very Mysterious Powers ascribed to it. Indeed, it is no
other than the Five Pointed Star Of The Microcosm Or An­
cient Pentacle, which was said to be the means of protecting the faithful student of
Occult and Spiritual Mysteries from all Evil Influences. They also believed it helped to
preserve mankind from the Machinations of Evil Spirits.
Rennet, Bishop Of Peterborough, Says: When this Ancient Pentagram Or Five Pointed
Star, is delineated on the body of a man it points out the Five Places wherein the Saviour
was wounded, and, therefore, the devils are afraid of it. No Evil Spirit could pass where
it was displayed, and for this reason it was always used in Magic Ceremonies to 'bind with,’
as the Spirits of Darkness can have no power over the one who has this Talisman.
de Laurence Says: It is the Seal Of The Microcosm through which MAN CAN COM­
MAND the Powers and Being of the Elements and restrain Evil Spirits. The Symbols of
the Planets and the Sacred Names of God, in Ancient Hebrew, engraved upon the Front
Side of the Solid G-old Combination Talismans shown here, are believed to give it added
Power and Efficacy.
The Sign Of The Cross. Must we be astonished after this at the real influence exer­
cised by this Sign of the Intelligences of every Hiearchy? Evil Spirits who do not seem
to be afraid of the Cross are driven out by the Pentagram and shudder at the aspect of the
Five Pointed Star Of The Microcosm. The Occult student when he feels his will grow weak
or that a bad influence is around him, if he has one of these Combination Talismans, he casts
his eye on the Pentagram and feels himself to be armed with Intellectual Omnipotence,
providing that he is truly worthy to be conducted by the Star to the Cradle Of Divine Reali­
zation; provided he understands the uses of Ancient Talismans, the Pentacle, Cup, Magic
Wand, and Sword; provided, lastly that the Intrepid glances of his soul correspond to those
“Two Eyes” which the upper ray of this Ancient Pentagram always represents to him open.
It is the Sign of the Absolute and Universal Synthesis.

Faith In The Efficacy Of Sacred Names, Pentagrams And Occult Symbols
The Present Vogue For Talismans. The Subject itself seems to be an interesting one,
and these are a most remarkable example of Ancient Talismans. The Ancients and
Early Christians had great Faith and Belief in the Efficacy of Religious Talismans, Divine
Inscriptions, Sacred Names, and Symbols. We, therefore, believe that these Handsome
Solid Gold and Sterling Silver Double Sided Talismans will be greatly appreciated; because
of the present vogue for Talismans, Symbols and Charms of all kinds, and the great popu­
larity of anything Ancient, Mediaeval, or something that comes out of the Far Bast.
These Combination Talismans have become immensely popular as they are Finely Hand
Engraved and beautifully finished and can be carried in the Pocket or worn on a Watch
Chain or on a lady’s Neck Chain.
Two Styles And Three Sizes In Solid Gold And Sterling Silver.
Read This Carefully. Combination Talismans are furnished in Two Styles and Three
Sizes. One Style can be carried in the pocket, and the other is equipped with a Solid Gold
Link so that it can be worn on a Gentleman’s Watch Chain or a Lady’s Neck Chain, as
shown in the illustrations on the next pages. The largest is the size of an American

THE FINEST RELIGIOUS TALISMAN RINGS EVER MADE.
The Famous Coventry Ring. A remarkable example of The Religious Talismans of
The Fifteenth Century, is The Coventry Ring shown above. On the outside of this
Noted Ring there is Engraved a scene representing Jesus rising from the Tomb with
the Five Wounds arranged on either side and the following Inscriptions: “The Well
Of Everlasting Life,” “The Well Of Pity,” “The Well Of Mercy,” “The Well Of
Comfort,” “The Well Of Grace.”
Jesus Went His Way. The Five Wounds Symbolize the Five Senses through which
we have the- power of wounding Our Lord by yielding to the temptation of the Flesh and
the Devil. The above, Engraved upon a Ring, were regarded as an efficacious Talisman
against all misfortune and Evil Influences. Inside this Ring is Engraved the names
or the Three Kings of Cologne, or the Magi—The Three Wise Kings—Caspar, Signifying
the White One; Melchoir, King of Light, Baltasar, the Lord of Treasures; also in Latin
the verse Luke iv. 30, I. H. S.; “Autem transiens per medium illorum ibat” (Jesus passing
thrpug'h the midst went His way.) This text was worn as a Charm against Evil, Danger,
or Misfortune of any kind by sea and land, and especially against Black Magic and
Evil Spirits. To commemorate his escape in the great naval battle off Sluys in the
year 1340, Edward III had this very same verse Engraved upon his Gold Nobles. The
Sigil ANANIZAPTA is also engraved in Latin inside of this Ring, and when translated
means: “Have mercy on us, O Judge;” this Sigil was considered a powerful protection
against Disease. Evil Influences and Misfortune. For further description of the Coventry
Ring, see next page.
NOTE. The statements made in the advertisement, on the pages of this Catalogue, of Ancient
Religious Talisman and Symbol Rings, while not guaranteed, have been obtained from sources
which are believed to be reliable. All that we claim for these Talisman Rings and Stick Pins, is
that they are 14 Karat and 10 Karat Solid Gold with Ancient Religious Talismans and Symbols
Hand Engraved upon their Crest or Monogram Plate. The subject dealt with is an interesting one
and we believe that these Talismans and Symbols, which express the faiths and beliefs of by gone
days in the efficacy of Religious Talismans, Symbols, Divine Inscriptions, and Sacred Names, will
be greatly appreciated; because of the present vogue for Talismans, Symbols and Charms of all kinds,
and the great popularity of anything Ancient, or something that comes out of the Far East.
These Symbols and Ancient Religious Talismans were reproduced by de Laurence from a reliable
and well known treatise on the subject of Ancient Talismans, Amulets, Zodiacal Signs, and Gems.
The authors of this noted treatise claim that it, “Being the result of many years of study and
research, it is not easy in all cases to specify the original source of our information, which has been
collected, not only from ancient and modern writings, but also from the personal experience and
experiments noted at the time they occurred, long before this book was contemplated.” The authors
also acknowledge their obligations to the Directors of the British Museum for the facilities given Tn
obtaining information, and their permission to make drawings from the actual Amulets, Symbols, and
Ancient Religious Talismans in their collection.

THE COVENTRY RING
Famous Talisman Of The Fifteenth Century
10 And 14 Karat Solid Gold
Beautifully Engraved And Finely Finished
Famous Coventry Ring.
Worn By Both Men And Women. These noted Rings are
well liked and are worn by both men and women who have
great and unbounded faith in the Efficacy of Sacred Names and
Religious Talismans, especially when engraved upon a Band
Ring of Solid Gold. The Rings shown here are most artistically
engraved and the finest made. The price asked is exceedingly
small considering that they are Extra Heavy Solid Gold Rings.
The feature of these rings is the wonderful manner in which
they are engraved on both the inside and the outside. This
special engraving has been done by a Master of the Engraver’s
Art, who is held to be one of the best in the world. The average
Jeweler would charge from $12.00 to $15.00 alone for the amount
of engraving done on one of these rings. In consideration of
this, the price asked for them is very low. The above illus­
trations, although, of course much larger than the rings them­
selves, give but a vague idea of their great beauty, value and
finish. It will be noticed that there are Two Widths for Gentle­
men and one for Ladies.
Three Styles In 10 And 14 Karat Solid Gold.
Furnished In Three Styles. The Coventry Ring is furnished in Three Styles as fol­
lows: Style A., for Gentlemen, is a magnificent, Extra Heavy, Finely Finished, Hand
Engraved Band Ring almost one-half inch in width. It is strongly made and should
last a lifetime. Style B„ also for Gentlemen, is a Handsomely Engraved. Medium Weight
Band Ring about three-eighths of an inch in width. Style C„ is for Ladies. It is a
Medium Weight Ring about one-fourth of an inch in width, Beautifully Engraved and
Finished. All Three Styles, as shown on the preceding page, come in 10 and 14 Karat

Size Of Your Finger. As these Rings are made to order and must be sized before they are en­
graved, it is absolutely necessary that you use great care in sending the size of your Finger, because
it is impossible to change the size of these rings after they have been engraved. To determine the
size of ring wanted, cut from a piece of writing paper, a strip that will just fit around your finger,
and pin this strip of paper to your order.

Religious Talismans And “Charmed Rings.” It is of course, difficult
and futile to speculate as to the extent of the influence that their belief
in Amulets and Religious Talisman Rings exercised over the Ancient
Egyptians: but in the light of The Higher Spiritual Forces it appears
that the Religious Symbolism they represented; the conditions under
which they were made; the Faith and Belief in their efficacy, and the
Invocation and “words of power”, which in every case were a most essential part of
their Mysterious Composition, make them exceedingly popular and by far the most
interesting Talisman Rings ever made. With the Romans the wearing of a Ring in the
form of a Serpent Coiled around the Finger signified an Invocation to the God o<*.
Health, Wealth and Love. “Charmed Rings,” says a writer, who gained permission, froG*
the directors of The British Museum, to make drawings from the actual Ancient Talis­
mans in their collection, “have also been much in favor with many nations, the Greeks
being partial to ‘Enchanted Rings’; which made according to the favorable position
of the Planets at the time of one’s birth.”

which is proclaimed to be the Greatest and Most Potent of

Why should any person be astonished that many believe
in the real influence and effect of this Ancient Pentagram
Talisman, especially when Hand Engraved upon the Mono­
gram Plate of Solid Gold Rings like the ones shown here.
Most everyone who has had any experience whatever in
Spiritualism and Invocations, knows that Evil Spirits shud­
der and are afraid of this Ancient Pentagram or Five Pointed
Star. However, on the contrary, when the Initiate or Ex­
positor of Occult Science fails to get results, he casts his
eye on this Ancient Pentagram or Five Pointed Star engraved
upon a Solid Gold Ring which he always wears on his
right hand, and feels himself to be armed with Intellectual Omnipotence, provided that he
is truly a student worthy to be conducted by the Star to the Cradle of Divine Realization;
provided he Knows, Dares, Wills, and can hold his peace; provided he understands the
uses of the Pentacle, Cup, Magic Wand, and Sword; provided lastly, that the intrepid glances
of his soul correspond to those “Two Eyes” which the upper ray of this Ancient Penta­
gram always presents to him open.
Rennet, Bishop Of Peterborough, Says: “When this Ancient Pentagram is delineated
on the body of a man it points out the Five Places wherein the Savior was wounded, and,
therefore, the devils are afraid of it. No evil spirit could pass where it was displayed, and
for this reason it was always used in Magic Ceremonies to ‘bind with,’ as the Spirits of
Darkness can have no power over anyone who wears this Talisman Engraved on a Solid
Gold Ring.”
Worshippers Deeply Read In Occult Lore. The Author, of a Noted Work on Ancient and
Mediaeval Talismans, Says: “In the Middle Ages it was looked upon as a Symbol of Immense
power, and was worn for health and safety, both in the Spiritual as well as in the Physical
sense and the Magical Pentacle in the western window of the southern aisle of Westminster
Abbey is one of the Emblems still existing to prove that the worshippers of old were
deeply read in Occult Lore. It is the Seal of the Microcosm through which Man can Com­
mand the Powers and Beings of the Elements and restrain Evil Spirits.

have always been in great demand.
Most Historical Rings. The Bible in Genesis speaks of some Twelve Different Designs
of Signet And Seal Rings, and as the old Egyptians wore them it may be assumed that
they are the most Historical Rings in the world.
There always has been a most profound and universal belief in the efficacy of Talisman Rings.
Indeed, this faith and belief has prevailed among the people of every nation in all ages of the
world. The Bible, in Genesis, speaks of some twelve different designs of solid gold Signet And
Seal Rings. These were worn as Talismans in Ancient Egypt. The Egyptians used them as a
Talisman or Amulet, as all will find who read the history of the children of Israel during their
sojourn into Egypt, for the Bible shows that the Signet And Seal Ring is a very historical Talis­
man. The famous Signet And Seal Rings shown on these pages are made from Virgin Gold, are
Hand Engraved and can be worn by any lady or gentleman, being the most attractive Ring ever
designed.

The Gift of Prophecy. Moses performed his wonders be­
fore King Pharaoh, and the stretching out of his hands by
which he divided the waters of the Red Sea (Exodus xiv. 16).
This same Gift of Prophecy was given to others by Moses.
Again, various condition of Clairvoyance are clearly described
by Moses (Numbers xii. 2-8).
de Laurence Says: “Spiritual Clairvoyance is an expres­
sion of the Divine Word: a Light from the very purest source.
It is the Spiritual Gift and Revelation of the Soul to the out­
ward man.”
Magi Of The Mystic City. There is assuredly an Occult
Virtue attributed to a “Solid. Gold Signet And Seal Ring."
Many strange legends and beliefs of the old-world have gathered about the Solid Gold
Signet And Seal Ring with an Occult Symbol engraved thereon. As a Solid Gold Signet
And Seal Ring resists all contamination, it is supposed to preserve its wearer against ill
luck and evil influences. It also has the Mystic power, so it is said, of attracting the love
and respect of others towards those who wear it. According to the old-world lore of
Symbolism it is one of the rings worn by the Magi of the Mystic City.
Antiquity ascribes to it various high virtues, and many Mystics wear a Signet Ring.
The reveries of Mythologists and later Kabalism claim it contributes its influence for the
production of subtlety in soul and astral sight. As a Symbol it signifies faith, and purity;
it is said to banish sadness and evil thoughts, and to soothe troubled spirits; to insure
respect for all those who wear it, and a way to the realization of their lawful wishes. It
is claimed, by the different schools of Symbolism, that it drives away evil thoughts, pro­
motes chastity, attracts the favor of the great, repels sorceries and evil spirits.. What
has been said here shows that it is believed that a Solid Gold Signet And Seal Ring has
many virtues. Many claim that good fortune is obtained and favors secured from others
by the wearing of one of these Rings especially when the Occult Symbol shown above has
been engraved upon its Monogram Plate.

The Oecult Symbol, Hand Engraved on the Solid Gold Monogram Plate of these famous
Signet and Seal Rings, was a very noted Talisman, the very same having been used by the
Ancient Magi of Alexander Egypt. According to the Tradition of Moses this very same
Seal or Talisman, was recommended by him to be used to compel Obedience and Respect on
the part of those who wish Secret Knowledge and Honors.
Moses, the law giver of the Jews, received his Secret Knowledge regarding Seals and
Talismans, from the Ancient Egyptians at Alexander Egypt, and it was no other but Moses
that said: “If Spirits don’t appear or if they hesitate in their obedience, burn Incense, and
when the smoke arises, show your Signet and Seal Ring. The procedure of Moses, for
Citation, Invocation and Obedience of Spirits, that is, to compel them to obey you, as far
as we know, has never been surpassed. This is in accordance with the word of Might,
which Moses, Aaron and Solomon used according to the Revelations of God. Again, accord­
ing to the “SIXTH AND SEVENTH BOOKS OF MOSES,” and "THE GREATER KEY OF
SOLOMON,” they were able to compel the Spirits to reveal the Treasures of the Earth and
also to quickly, bring your desires forward honestly so that you could appear before your
fellowmen, without fear, for, nothing can harm you, much rather, all must serve you and
yield obedience, and serve you according to your wishes. It was these Great men, such as
Solomon, Moses, Aaron, Agrippa, Paracelsus, Levi, and de Laurence, that revealed all that

KING SOLOMON
Famous Optimistic Ring
Chaidiac Inscription On Its Crest Means
“THIS SHALL ALSO PASS”
RADIATES TRUE OPTIMISM AND HAPPINESS
True Chaidiac Inscription. Success and Optimism is the
message conveyed by this striking Talisman Ring. The
True Chaldiac Inscription On Its Crest, translated means
“THIS SHALL ALSO PASS.” This Ancient Inscription
stands as a constant reminder to the wearer, of this won­
derful Ring, that no matter what his troubles and diffi­
culties may be, they will soon pass away.
King Solomon’s Day. The Chaldiac Inscription on this
.... «• pin,. Ring, dates back to King Solomon’s day. It is said that
the Architect who designed Solomon’s Marvelous Temple,
wore such a Talisman Ring while he was concerned with his stupendous task; because
it helped to encourage him and keep him bright and cheerful in the midst of his troubles
and difficulties.
Egyptian In Design. This remarkable King Solomon Optimistic Ring is decidedly
Egyptian in design. It is handsomely Enameled, bearing on its Crest a Chaldiac Inscrip­
tion which means “THIS SHALL ALSO PASS.” It derives its name from a story to
the effect that the Architect of King Solomon’s Temple wore a Ring with the same
Inscription, as a daily reminder that even the most perplexing difficulties could not last
for ever. The Handsome Antique finish of the Ring shown here, combined with its
highly Artistic appearance make it one of the finest Optimistic or Talisman Rings ever
produced.
Talisman, Optimistic And Good Luck Rings In Demand. With the present Vogue for
Talismans and Charms of all kinds, and the great popularity of anything Ancient, or
something that comes out of the Far East, this Ring is enjoying a most wonderful sale.
Again, the interesting story connected with it, and the True Chaldiac Inscription in Solid
Gold on its beautifully enameled Crest has made it extremely popular.
This Shall Also Pass. Rings of this kind, which Radiate Optimism, are well liked
and much sought after by that class of deep thinkers who always welcome anything that
helps to encourage them, and keep them hopeful and cheerful, midst their troubles, disap­
pointments and difficulties. Catch the Optimistic Spirit which this remarkable Ring
conveys, and no matter what your troubles and difficulties are, may be, they will soon pass
away. The Chaldiac Inscription on the Crest of this Ring, translated means “THIS SHALL
ALSO PASS,” and was worn, so we are told, by the Architect who designed King Solomon’s
Temple; because it helped to encourage him, and make him successful in his work. It
is not surprising, therefore, that a High Grade Solid Gold Ring with the same Inscription
upon it should be much sought after today, and worn for the same reason that King
Solomon’s Architect wore it.
Worn By Ladies And Gentlemen. This Remarkable Ring, with an Ancient Chaldiac
Inscription on its Crest, is well liked and greatly appreciated by both Men and Women, who
like the Architect of King Solomon’s Temple, greatly desire something which will be a Daily
and Constant reminder to its wearer that no matter what their troubles and difficulties
may be, they will soon pass away.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF SOLOMON THE “WISE MAN”
A Righteous Man’s Righteous Child.
Noted For His Profound Wisdom And Deep Knowledge.
Solomon, The “Wise Man.” Solomon, Son of David and Bathsheba, (1033-975 B. C.);
King of Israel; noted for his Wisdom and deep Knowledge of Spiritual and Occult Forces.
Solomon was a King; the son of a King; the Wise Son of a Wise Father; a Righteous man’s
Righteous Child. David, the father of Solomon, reigned for forty years, as it is written,
“And the days that David governed Israel were forty years.” Of Solomon, it is written.
“And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. Four hundred and thirty-
three years elapsed between the date of Solomon’s reign and that of the Temple’s destruc­
tion. Solomon wrote five books; “Proverbs,” “Ecclesiastes,” “The Song Of Solomon,”
“The Greater Key Of Solomon”, and “The Lesser Key Of Solomon.”
The Holy Temple. He built his Temple in seven years and occupied fourteen years
in erecting his Palace. He was the King alluded to in Proverbs 16-23, "The heart of
the wise maketh his mouth, intelligent, and upon his lips increaseth information.” Mean­
ing that if a man possessing brilliant diamonds and precious stones, keeps his jewels
concealed, no one is aware of their value; but if he allows them to be seen, their worth
becomes known. While the Wisdom of Solomon was locked in his own breast it was of
value to no one, but when he gave the world his Five Books, they increased the informa­
tion of his people. So great was his reputation that any one in doubt concerning the
meaning of a Biblical passage sought the king for an interpretation. Not only in Sacred
Lore did he raise the standard of education. He had taught the Sciences of Natural
Philosophy, Physiology, Agriculture, Mathematics, Occultism, Talismanic Magic, Astron­
omy, Chemistry, and Rhetoric. In Occultism and Talismanic Magic he was an Adept.
Solomon’s Method Of Teaching-. His method of teaching is illustrated by the following
comparison; “There was a basket without handles, filled with fine fruit, but the owner
was unable to carry it until a wise man attached handles to the basket.” So did Solomon
remove dimcuities from the path of the student. Rabbi kuna further illustrates this same
thing. “There was once,” he said, “a well of pure water; but so deep that the people
were not able ro reach the water, until a man of wisdom taking a bucket, attached to it
one rope after another until the whole was long enough to reach the water." So was
it with Solomon’s teachings. The Bible is a well of truth, but its teachings are too deep
for the understanding of some. Solomon, however, introduced Parables and Proverbs
suited to the comprehension of all, through which means a knowledge of the law became
readily obtainable.
The 1916 And 1920 de Laurence Editions.
“The Greater Key Of Solomon;” by King Solomon, who was the Son of David and Bath­
sheba, the King Of Israel. Solomon was noted for his Wonderful knowledge of Occultism
and his great ability to make Seals and Talismans. He also had great knowledge of Spir­
itual and Occult Forces. David. Solomon’s father, reigned over Israel 40 years and strange
as it may seem to relate, he flourished over 1000 years before the Birth of Christ. This is the
reason why “THE GREATER KEY OF SOLOMON” is a Marvelous book having been trans­
lated from Ancient Manuscripts now in the British Museum, London.- A full description of
“The Greater Key Of Solomon” will be found elsewhere in this catalogue.
King Solomon’s Secret Procedure, As stated above “The Greater Key Of Solomon” is
one of the World’s most Remarkable Books. It embraces a Clear and Precise Exposition
of King Solomon’s Secret Procedure; its Mysteries and Magic Rites; Original Plates,
Seals, Pentacles, Charms and Talismans Translated And Reproduced from Ancient Manu­
scripts, now in The British Museum, London, England. There is nothing in Occult
Literature which can suffer comparison with the Historical Manuscripts of “Solomon,
The Son Of David, King Of Israel.” These Manuscripts give Instruction for the Operation
Of Talismanic and Ceremonial Magic, as well as for performing various Evocations.
Besides Seals, Sigils, and Magical Diagrams, nearly Fifty Pentacles or Talismans are
given In the Plates of The 1916 de Laurence Edition of “The Greater Key ’Of Solomon.”
Reveals AH Secrets. The popular traditions of Magic affirm that he who possesses
"The Keys Of Solomon” can communicate with Spirits of . all grades. These Keys, so
often lost, and as often again recovered, are no other than the Talismans of the 72
different names and the Mysteries of the 32 Hieroglyphical Paths. By the aid of these
Signs, it is possible, so it is claimed, to arrive at the natural and mathematical Revelation
of all Secrets of nature as set forth in the 1916 de Laurence Edition of “The Greater
Key Of Solomon.”
ANCIENT TALISMAN RING
Extra Heavy, Comes In 10 And 14 Karat Solid Gold
Ancient Talisman Ring. This Ring is designed after one
found in “The Book Of Black Magic And Of Pacts;” an
English work on Ceremonial Magic. An interesting and
curious inscription found tinder this Talisman Ring reads
as follows: “Gives invisibility, even to the eyes of the
genii, so that God alone shall witness the actions of the
possessor. It is accompanied by the power of penetrating
everywhere and passing through brick walls. The Magic-
Words are BENATIR, CARARKAU, DEDOS, ENTINARMI. For each operation
the ring must be placed upon a different finger of the right hand.”

THE DIAMOND
NATURE’S GREATEST TALISMAN
OCCULT VIRTUE ATTRIBUTED TO DIAMONDS
There is assuredly an Occult Virtue attributed to the genuine Diamond. This precious
stone, precious and valued as a Talisman for success in undertakings, has no equal among the
jewels of the world.
It has a deeper virtue than the Ruby, and it is impossible to find in
Nature a greater Talisman than the genuine Diamond.
It is impossible for some to understand the great personal value of
a Diamond, and few there are who have touched only the fringe of its
mysterious influence and power.
We have written here much that is of meaning from the annals of
old-woild lore, and the reader who has gifts of discernment knows that
the truth regarding the Occult Virtue of Diamonds has never been put
“in writing.
Many know also in what sense the virtue attributed to Diamonds
may sometimes not be literally understood, but often—and much more
often—in a Mystic and interior way.
This precious Jewel would not be a symbol if its meaning were not
also symbolic.
All deep and advanced students of the Occult and Kabalistic schools
of the far East, who have practiced Magic, know how certain planetary
influences have placed the Diamond, which is the gem par excellence,
under the presidency of Mars.
The Diamond is held to be the chief symbol of success and love in the world of Jewels. The
Diamond also signifies innocence, constancy, fidelity, and, in the higher language of the virtues,
it has been held, by many, to represent the absolute degrees of purity and strength, thereby
becoming at once the world’s greatest Luck Stone and Talisman for success. Its place among
the precious stones mentioned in biblical record is sufficiently indicated by the fact that the High
Priest Aaron wore a Diamond on his finger and divined thereby and therein. In plain words
Bible records show that by the wearing of a Diamond Ring Aaron was able to see clairvoyantly
and read in the Astral Light.
Contemporary French Occultism—which too often extends the circle of the secret sciences in
the art of describing—has discovered that the Diamond is the Symbol and Talisman of the
Magi, and the Sage; who has stripped off all passion and lives in the absolute of complete intel­
lectuality. The Diamond, which is the par excellence, and gem of precious jewels without doubt
confers success, peace and serenity upon the owner thereof.
When worn in a Solid Gold Ring upon the left hand, it protects one against enemies and
evil influences, paralyzing their endeavors and bringing their snares to nothing, so it is said.
It has, so it is believed, the same virtue in respect to failure in one’s undertakings.
Because it renders those who wear it faithful to their engagements, there was a time when
it adorned the wedding ring in Italian and Oriental marriage, while on account of its virtue in
love, the Diamond was held to secure felicity and faithfulness of wedded pairs.
Its sudden intervention—perchance as a gift—was thought certain to heal conjugal ruptures,
or quarrels between lovers, and husband and wife, and hence, it was called the Stone Of Reconcili­
ation. This in itself is testimony sufficient to constitute an inherent virtue for good in the Dia­
mond—reconciliation by gifts having worked through this media from time immemorial. The
long list of Occult virtues, hidden properties, influences, powers and graces of the Diamond might
be continued indefinitely.
In the Psychic order of things, so it is claimed, the Diamond helps to the development of
spirit and astral sight, dissolves enchantments, drives off evil spirits and were-wolves, as well as
incubi and succubi, endows the understanding with lucidity, stills remorse—supposing that re­
pentance has preceded—and in fine gives strength and courage.
In the medical order, it tends to help mental troubles and wards off the ravages of insomnia
and nervousness. Many who are well learned in the lore of precious gems have affirmed that the
Diamond gives eloquence and renown, and has the power to deliver the possessed from the
ravages of obsession. That there are many virtues attributed to the Diamond is apparent, as it
is said to possess higher virtues and to drive away evil thoughts, promote chastity, attract the
favor of the great, repel sorceries and witchcraft, and to banish sadness of spirit.

THE DIAMOND
A TALISMAN FOR SUCCESS
THE RAJAH’S DIAMOND
It is a positive and undeniable fact that Diamonds are the most fortunate jewels to own
and wear, as was evidenced when The Rajah of Kashgar presented an unknown and obscure
army officer with the Rajah’s Diamond, the. sixth known Diamond of the world. The gift of
this Diamond transformed the General from a poor into a wealthy man, from an obscure and
unpopular soldier into one of the lions of London Society. Indeed, the soldier after he pos­
sessed the Rajah’s Diamond was welcomed into the most exclusive circles, and exerted such
a wonderful influence that he married a lady, young, beautiful and well-born, who was willing
to marry the soldier after he became owner of this Diamond. It was said at the time that,
“as like attracts like,” one jewel had attracted another; for certainly the lady, whom the sol­
dier married, was not only a gem of the finest water in her own person, but she showed herself
to the world in a very costly setting; and she was considered by many respectable authorities
as one among the three or four best dressed women in England. So it is with all men and
women who own or wear a Diamond, that brilliant Jewel loved and sought after by all the
world. It seems to send forth a Magic brilliancy unlike any other jewel, and is more precious
and valuable to its owner than the gold of Ophir.
A famous man once said: “I have hunted most things, from man and woman down to
lion; I have dived for Coral; I have followed both whales and tigers; but the Diamond is
the tallest quarry of the lot. It has beauty and worth; it alone can properly reward the
ardors of the chase.” This well expresses the immense desire that possesses all people to
own a Diamond. Diamonds are the very best investment; they never get out of date, neve1-
become second-handed, but constantly increase in value and beauty; give their owner prest’
and open the doorway for successful advancement in all walks of life; for; wear a Dia-
and you will be admitted, respected and admired wherever you go.

possible, for it is an ancient belief that a diamond ring possesses some power, or influence,
which inclines success and good fortune to its wearer. Seventy-five per cent of those who
buy a diamond always keep it, as they seem to realize that it ensures success. Every wide­

That Diamonds are steadily advancing—That Diamonds are the best investment—That their

A Genuine Diamond mounted in a ring made of Virgin Gold, is said: “to prove of great

that it is begun and ended under the direction of a Master Adept) ; the person for whom it

Philosophers of all ages adored the Diamond as a Talisman for success in ALL undertak­

the power of projection, counselled them, and admonished them, to wear upon the third finger
of their left hand a stone called the Diamond mounted in a ring of Virgin Gold. Jesus invited
his believers to build on a stone, or rock if they did not wish their structures to be demolished.
He terms himself the cornerstone, and says to the most faithful of his apostles, “Thou art
Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church." This stone, say the old Masters, is the

women. The study of Talismans and Pentacles is one of the most interesting branches of
Occultism and connects with historical numismatics. There are Hindu, Egyptian and Kabal-

Societies; but the Diamond is The King Of Jewels in every Occult Temple.

THREE HEADED TALISMAN SNAKE RING
Constructed Of Virgin Gold And Precious Stones
“He that weareth a Snake Ring about him, shall be
helped in every need or necessity.”—Ancient MSS.
THE GREAT WORD OF LIFE
Ordeal is the great word of life, and life itself is a Serpent which brings forth and
devours unceasingly. Men and women must escape from its folds; they must set their
foot upon its head, de Laurence, the greatest living Adept, has duplicated the Serpent,
setting it against itself, and, in an external equilibrium, he converted the Serppnt into a
Three Headed Snake Talisman Ring. This famous Ring is listed in five different styles,
ranging in price from Fifteen to One Hundred and Twenty-five Dollars each.
SACRED RING OF THE MAGI
The Ring Of Strength
The extraordinary interest which has recently been taken in The
Sacred Ring of the Magi, by advanced Occult Students, has become very
manifest. Flushed with their success, derived from wearing Talismans,
which they believe infallible, many are today taking advantage of the
opportunity offered here to secure one of these Three Headed Snake
Rings; for the very same is constructed of Virgin Gold and Precious
Stones and is known as “The Ring of Strength.” Indeed, there are
many who have tested the worth of Talismans, and beljeve there is
great Occult Virtue in a Three Headed Snake Ring when it is made of
Virgin Gold and mounted with Precious Stones. Their appreciation and
belief in Talismanic Operations are on a par with the unlimited faith of the ancients in
these mysterious agents from the laboratory of nature, as they are said to be, by those
writers of Ancient Manuscripts treating upon the subject of Talismanic Magic.
The writings of the ancients are filled with the various effects and descriptions of
Talismanic Snake Rings, many of which were formed of the most costly materials; as of
Virgin Gold, Diamonds, and other precious stones.
He who reads carefully what is written here, regarding this famous Three Headed
Snake Talisman Ring of India and Egypt, will receive an accurate description of this most
esteemed Talisman, which Ancient Manuscripts treat of, and also learn a Legend of the
Marvellous Efficacy which Tradition relates regarding it.
OCCULT VIRTUE ATTRIBUTED TO A SNAKE RING
The Ancients, who were extremely fond of Divination, were wont to place great con­
fidence and belief in the Occult Virtue of a “Three Headed Snake Ring”; but the very
same must be constructed purely of Virgin Gold and Precious Stones of very great value.
Those Ancients who believed in Clairvoyance and Divination well knew that results
depended upon the unfettered agency of the human mind and will, or intent to know or
foresee “any difficult or hidden thing.”
The Sacred Ring of the Magi is said to inherit a Virtue from the Snake, after which
it was designed and, on this account, is believed to act as a Charm against evil spirits and
witchcraft. It is also said to be of marvelous efficacy for men to wear while seeking
employment. The latter Virtue is also mentioned by many writers of the eighteenth
century. Again, let this Sacred Ring be worn on the third finger of the left hand and no
enemy or foe shall overcome the wearer, so it is said. This Ring being- worn is said to
protect the wearer against all invisible beings. Indeed, there are many who deem it
infallible, for in an Ancient Manuscript it is written that—“He that weareth a Snake Ring
about him, shall be helped in every need or necessity.”
The Three Headed Solid Gold Hand Made Talisman Snake Rings, shown on the next
page, are exactly like those worn by the Ancient Magi, being constructed of Virgin Gold
and Precious Stones. They are the most attractive Solid Gold Snake Rings ever worn
and are made exclusively for us by our own Manufacturing Jewelers.

With Every Order For A Birthday Ring.
ASTROLOGY AN OLD SCIENCE
Shows Your Faults, Virtues, And Predominating Characteristics
Whether A Man Will Make Good In Business And Be A Devoted Husband
WHICH SIGN WERE YOU BORN UNDER?
By L. W. de LAURENCE
\ The Planet Uranus. There is always something new and inter-
\\ esting that can be written about Astrology. The discovery of the
I I Planet Uranus on the 13th of March, 1781, and of Neptune on the
/j 20th of September, 1846, has enlarged the field of research.
' Astrology Shows A Person’s True Nature. The difficulty of
selecting a suitable partner in business, or a congenial associate in
any way, might be greatly obviated by your having a Life Reading.
Supposing a lady is to marry a gentleman of whose character or
concealed traits she knows little. If she wishes to learn something
about his temper, his faults, virtues and predominating characteristics
as well as whether he will make good in business and be a devoted
husband, let her find out the date of his next birthday, and obtain a
general Astrological Reading of his life, and no doubt she will learn
something very important regarding his true nature and personality.
Again, supposing a young man desires to learn just what kind of a
wife a certain girl will make; whether she would be fickle and unreli­
able, or whether she would be a loving wife, devoted to her home and
children. Let him find out the date of her next birthday, and obtain
a general Astrological Reading * of her life, and very likely he will
learn more of her true nature than he thought it possible for Astro­
logy to show. If those who are about to marry would get a general
Astrological Life Reading, of the one they intend marrying, they
might gain information that would help them to avoid many worries
and inharmonious domestic relations which many times result in
'ill quarrels and nervous breakdowns. Astrology teaches that a union of souls
WOlR* is necessary for a harmonious married life.
|y| Astrology An Old Science. An Astrological Life Reading will help those already mar-
MBH ried in overcoming any antagonistic element that either may possess. Astrology is an old
■V science. The Magi- of ancient times were Astrologers, and Life Readings are greatly appre-
r ciated by many today both among the married and the unmarried, as it helps them to
I *■ obtain self-control and forebearance^ and thereby avoid a sputter and fizz of warring
■yi natures which drive peace from the home. Again, Astrology has helped many to obtain
intellectual companionship entirely satisfying to their heart and soul.
The Stars An Index To Character. The foundation of the science of Astrology was the
Wa knowledge which all the ancient Astrologers shared, that the Stars Ruled Their Destiny,
or rather that the Stars which were overhead at the time of the birth of a child, would
LffPl be an Index To His Character, and as the Sun and Moon have more effect on this earth
iMS than any other Star or Planet;—so their position at that time would have the greatest
controlling influence. They knew that the Stars of Summer were different from the Stars
of Winter, and that it took one year for all of them to complete their seeming revolution
and begin again on their journey, and that each spring at the same time .showed the same
I stars overhead. As a result they divided the year into Twelve Parts, with a separate set
of stars directly overhead during every part. Each set they discovered showed the out-
HeB line of some animal or object, so they named them after which they resembled. They
VBH also found that the character of the object which the stars represented overhead -would
JgXl bestow like characteristics on the child born under them. Thus Libra, the Scales, gives
■■I impartial justice, and Sagittarius, the Archei' a sure aim. The date of the month, and
the hour of the day however, would make a great difference in temperament.
RflB A Child Born In The Night-Time. The influence of the sun, moon and certain stars
overhead form the character of a child during the first hours of its life, the sun being
the greatest, will have, of course, the most influence. So it is known that a Child Born
BKjS| in the Night-Time forms a Character more slowly than one born under the Sun’s Rays.
■ME And therefore a Night Child will develop more slowly than a Day Child, and will win his
or her success later in life. It is also known that at full moon the world moves more
; ; ' I harmoniously and people get along better together, while more evil is done in the dark
cHB of the morn. The Ancients taught that the earth,’ air and water, and every person born on
the earth belonged to one of these elements, according to the time of month he was born,
and under which one of the Twelve Groups Of Stars. These Twelve Constellations marked
the path, of the earth around the sun—and were called the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac.

Not Like They Were Before Marriage.
Marriage Used To Be Called A Lottery, Today It’s Pronounced A Failure
Explains Why People Disagree. Everybody has specu­
lated and wondered at the quarrels and separations of the
most excellent people considered individually, men and
women who outside of the marital relation were the corner­
stones of Social and Religious life. United, they were little
short of demons. “It is a shame and a disgrace,” has been
said, “that those folks cannot get along together, and they
certainly are not what they seemed to be before marriage;
nor what they now appear to be when they are apart.” All
can call to mind example after example of such domestic
infelicity, and so alarmingly frequent is this mismating that
long ago marriage was called a “lottery,” and today is pro­
nounced a “failure.”
The Great Mystery Of Attraction. Astrology explains
the Great Mystery of Magnetic attraction and repulsion.
Many have witnessed the most crucial suffering of married
people, for which neither wife nor husband could ascribe
any adequate cause. Many have observed the quick repul­
sions which have taken place after marriage, and which
grew into unendurable hatred. Many have seen the constant
wife broken-hearted because of her husband’s inconstancy,
and faithful, noble husbands made miserable by their wives’
extravagance, selfishness, and dishonor. But that there is
to be found in Astrology a scientific explanation of such
conditions you will not deny if you ever obtain A General
Astrological Life Reading, according to the Sign of the Zo­
diac under which you were born. Send an order for one of

to determine, in part, the nature of both the mental and physical life of those born when
the Earth and other Planets are in certain angles from the Sun; that is, certain Signs
of the Zodiac.
The Solar Region. Why the nature of a person is specifically influenced in one
direction more than in another may seem strange. However, if one considers for a
moment the Grand Contention of Forces that are struggling for supremacy in the
Solar Region when he is born, and the fact that, even from a material standpoint, the
volume, direction and effect of these Forces are forever Varying; Surging; Overcoming;
and again Equalizing each other; it should be easily realized that they may, and do,
influence mentality, destiny and results. It would undoubtedly change the tentative
Art into a Science, if the laws that underlie these effects were better understood by the
average person. It is known, however, by experience that the effect of positions, in a
measure the distance, relations, and the distinctive Forces from each body of the Solar
System does influence the Mental and Physical Nature of man; and, in fact, all life.
The intuitions of the Ancients were as true in this Art as in the equally unmeasured
phases of .Ethics; Morality; Religion, and in some other branches of knowledge. In
consideration of this it may be accepted as true that the attitude and relation of the
Planets and the Set Configuration of the Heavens—once the result of their relations
are determined—do interpret the nature of every person, born at any place or time.
Learn What Path You Should Follow. It is nonsensical for any one to enter a
profession or engage in any trade or occupation for which they are not eminently suited.
Competition is too great and if you do not take up the thing you are capable of doing
the best you will not succeed; because you will find others engaged in it who are suc­
cessful because they are suited to it better than you are. Therefore, do not choose
your work or profession ignorantly or as a matter of convenience, necessity or exped­
iency; for .without doubt you of course possess some natural talent that will make you
a success if you find out what it is. Astrology points out with deadly and unfailing
accuracy the path you should follow in order to develop your hidden powers and to
succeed; for you are undoubtedly endowed with some genius or talent which should not
be wasted on trying to do something that you are not fitted for. The people who are
successful; the ones who achieve the greatest success are those who follow professions
and vocations to which they are best suited. Astrology helps you to determine what
occupation to adopt, or what profession you should follow; it aids you in selecting the
proper one to marry, or the best business for you to follow.
Letters Prove It Helps. Do Not condemn yourself, do not be discouraged, but in­
vestigate. The facts or truths of anything are often denied by the person who does not
investigate. Do not form the habit of condemning yourself, and denying instead of
investigating. Astrology has a strong fundation, based on facts. It has helped people
in all ages of the world. We firmly believe that the full Astrological Reading we give
away with every Order for a Zodiac Talisman Ring, Zodiac Talisman Stick Pin, Ancient
Talisman Ring, Occult Symbol Ring, or a Birthday Ring, is worth hundreds of dollars
to the one receiving it. We know, from experience, that it has helped and guided lots of
people to better conditions in life. We have many letters from people who have ex­
pressed their delight at the information contained in the Reading we sent them, accord­
ing to the Sign of the Zodiac under which they were born.
“Marking Time,” “Easing Along.” Most every avenue of commercial life today is
crowded with “misfits,” that is. girls, women, boys, and men who are crowded into offices,
factories and shops to learn trades or professions to which their talents are not adapted,
and who will never obtain any great degree of success. They are incompetents, “marking
time,” “easing along,” on the endless sea of uncertainty and destiny. If you are engaged
in a profession or business to which you are not adapted you will soon become dis­
couraged, and never succeed, later on poverty and old age will make your life miserable.
With some the change of locality or business seems to make them more successful, while
to others wealth and happiness come either early or late in life. A mistake may mean
a lifetime of failure, and many people fail because they do not follow the work or busi­
ness they are best suited to. If you are dissatisfied, unsuccessful, unhappy in your
married life; or your financial affairs are not just as you want them, it is quite possible
that A General Astrological Life Reading will throw much light on the conditions about
you and give you information that may be the means of making you more successful.

Courtship And Marriage. If you, by receiving A Life Reading are able to determine
your own mentality, or the mentality of the one you intend to marry, so as to. learn
whether they are Cautious, Brave, and Courageous; or whether they are Vacillating,
Deceitful and Unreliable; whether there is Liability of Severe Temper, Unrestrained Self­
defense, a Disposition to be Quarrelsome and Meddlesome; whether their Mentality has
a wide field of action and is disposed to take care of your interests; whether the Com­
mercial Instincts of their nature are essentially those of Honesty and Fairness; whether
they lack Pride and Ambition; or whether they are highly endowed with Good Impulses
and Personal Pride. By getting A Life Reading of the one you Intend marrying, you
can learn whether their nature is that of Mental Harmony; Warm, Sunny, Genial, and
Endowed with Great Vitality and Force; whether the dominant elements of their
nature are Faith and Confidence, aspiring to power through Eloquence and Vigor.
By Astrology you will be in a better position to obtain that true affinity which the
Planets alone can reveal; for Astrology shows the one whom you can marry and live
with in peace and harmony. If you marry without a knowledge of Planetary influence
you may not be well pleased with the results. True Marriage and True Affinity is the

their thoughts and wishes are the same, if ever parted always look forward with eager
expectation to the time when they will be united again. True love gives a touch of ex­
quisite pleasure only to those whose natures harmonize. Woman’s nature is one that
desires true love more than sexual relation. She wants some one to care for her, to honor
her and to prove their true affinity. A beautiful flower may bloom, but many times fades,
wasting its beauty and exquisite fragrance upon the chilly air. Many a young girl and
woman has grown pale, their beautiful forms fading away into the coffin, because their
desire to be loved and honored has not been satisfied. Had they married their True
Affinity and been loved and honored, they would have had a better existence. A con­
servative woman and an extravagant or disorderly man have never been able to get
along, any more than can a wasteful woman and a saving man. This could all be avoided
by obtaining an Astrological fore-cast, or A General Life Reading and thereby secure a
knowledge of your own mentality, as well as much valuable information regarding the
talents, predominating characteristics and ability of the one you would marry.
Astrology Always Helps. The great charm of existence, and of success, is souls
satisfaction, that is, to know and to realize that your heart’s desires and wishes are
being fulfilled and satisfied. There are too many people today whose lives are tragedies.
Many who believe that it is their Fate and Destiny to lead a life of burden and sorrow;
believing that they are compelled by fate to “grin and bear it.” Astrology shows that
this it not God’s way and that it is not God’s wish that sorrow and misery follow you
like the shadow follows the ox that draws the plough. You can not afford to smother
your talents and allow your Ability, Youth, and dearest Hopes to die out and as a con­
sequence suffer all the days of your life. Astrology arms you with knowledge so that
you can be more successful in life; it gives you fresh courage, it invokes calm judgment,
and shows you whom it will be best for you to marry, and what business you have the
best chance of succeeding in.
All This Costs You Nothing, It’s Free With Ring Orders. Should we advertise these

Astrology, the oldest science in the world, opens the Mysterious Book of the future.
The Ancient Astrologers were Past Masters in the Art of Casting Horoscopes, their old
books, written almost two thousand years ago; being still an authority and source of all
of our present knowledge of this science. The records of the Astronomers of Ancient
India, Egypt, and Greece, as well as the recent discoveries among the ruined tombs of
the early Egyptian Kings,—built 4,500 years before the birth of Jesus—have furnished
us with the most positive proofs that the Great Astrologers of those days were conversant
with the principles of our Solar System. Astrology, however, has advanced wonderfully
in the last decade, especially along the line of Character and Life Reading. In science—
given a cause, one gets a certain result, and that is where Astrology becomes an exact
science, and ceases to be simply an art. In Astrology—given a birth date, one gets a
certain characteristic. It shows why the character of a person born at one time of the
year will differ radically from a brother or sister born at another time of the year, and
have many characteristics in common with an utter stranger born in the same month.
There may be two people of the same Sign, that is, born at the same time, in the same
month and year, and one seems to have all the faults and the other all the virtues, but
they will be distinctive faults and virtues of that Sign of the Zodiac under which they
were born. Again, one will find beautiful characters in the slums of crime and poverty,
perfectly, inexplicible when viewed from the standpoint of heredity and environment, and
the same thing reversed, a black sheep all alone in a family of culture and refinement.
This Does Not In The Least Imply Fatality. Every one is heir to all the virtues,
as well as the faults of his Sign, but a weak character doesn’t struggle with the faults,
and the virtues are swallowed up, whereas a strong character fights such a battle as
makes his good points doubly noticeable, even if the faults are not entirely overcome at
once. Astrology shows that harmony is unconsciously maintained between certain people
and discord, as unintentionally among others; it points out the road to either—so that
the marrying problem, and quarrels between lovers can be overcome.

informs us were wise old Astrologers, and the Geocentric Ephemerides, that is, the Tables
of the Planets compiled and issued by the famous Raphael of London, the Planets have a
powerful effect upon the human body.
FORTUNATE AND UNFORTUNATE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC
The Fortunate Signs of the
Zodiac are: Jupiter, Sun, Venus,
Mercury, and the Moon. The Un­
fortunate Planets or Signs of the
Zodiac ares Saturn and Mars.
With respect to the foregoing
Traditions, it must be well remem­
bered that to be born under a For­
tunate Planet, and also under a
Fortunate Sign, termed by the old
Hindu Astrologers, “The Top Or
Goodly Heights Of Fortune,” Sym­
bolical, as it is said, of “Riches,
Money, Power, and divers Happi­
ness, a life of’ pleasure, fortune and
long in duration.”
To be born under an Unfor­
tunate Planet, and also under an
Unfortunate Sign, is what they
termed “the evil demon of life,”
denoting “a fate or fortune of pov-
years.”
Fortunate Signs Of The Zodiac
Unfortunate Signs Of The Zodiac
erty, alms-craving, wretchedness, woe, and but of few
Also to be born under A Fortunate Planet and an Unfortunate Sign, denotes as they
say, “a full mean, or mixed fortune, now good, now ill, now buoyant upon Fate’s most
lucky pinions, now cast down and destitute of fellowship; fortune’s foot-ball, and also
her favorite as the Stars may decree in their course; of whom, know, O man! thou art
the subject, not the ruler.”
Understand the same of the rest. There is much of interest in these traditions, and
one will perceive this by obtaining a Life Reading for himself or his friends. Both the
Fortunate and the Unfortunate Signs of the Zodiac are shown engraved upon the Black
Plates above.
“Bad Luck” And “Good Luck.” When the Planets, as shown above, are favorable, it
would be, as a matter of fact, much easier to secure a position or succeed in any under­
taking, than when they were unfavorable; for it is then that everything seems to “go
against you.” This you call “bad luck,” but if you had a better understanding of
Astrology you would very soon conclude that there was no such a thing as “bad luck,”
and “good luck.” You would then know that everything is based upon God’s Laws, and
that God’s laws are immutable laws.
Consults Astrology. There are many people who believe so thoroughly in Astrology
that they obtain a Life Reading or consult the Astrologer on all important matters such
as Business, Travel, Marriage, Choosing a profession, entering a New Enterprise or
assuming New Responsibilities of any kind. They believe that an Astrological Reading
will fore-cast, and give them knowledge which is beyond the power of the ordinary
mind to gain in any other way. For it is true that A General Life Reading gives accurate
knowledge of your ability, talents and character. In consideration of this, A Reading
will be of benefit before entering in a new line of business or making any important
change.
Mistakes You Could Have Avoided. Lots of people fail no matter what line of humaA
tndeavor they enter, until they, by chance, sometimes enter into their true vocation when
they meet with great success. A little knowledge and consideration on your part regard­
ing anything that you are going to do, may be the means of saving you financial loss
an unhappy future or an unhappy marriage. Astrology teaches, that if you act whej
the Planets are in an unfavorable aspect you will nut be able to use your best judgment
thus making mistakes which you realize later you could have avoided. Astrology enables
you many times to take advantage of present and future opportunities. It enables yoi

ASTROLOGY
Which One of These Signs Were You Born Under?
The Three Signs Of The Zodiac. There are Three Signs of the Zodiac to each of the Four Ele­
ments, viz.: The Positive or Head Sign, the Centre or Equatorial Sign, and the Negative Sign; just
as there is a Positive or Repellent Pole, an Equatorial Centre, and "a Negative or Attractive Pole to the
earth. Thus—
POSITIVE POLE
Fire, Aries,
Earth, Taurus,
Air, Gemini,
Water, Cancer.
EQUATORIAL POLE
Fire, Leo,
Earth, Virgo,
Air, Libra,
Water, Scorpio.
NEGATIVE POLE
Fire, Sagittarius,
Earth, Capricornus,
Air, Aquarius,
Water, Pisces.
The Positive Signs. The Positive Signs of the Four Elements follow each other, beginning with
Fire and going through successively Earth, Air and Water. These Positive Poles, Aries, Taurus,
Gemini and Cancer are Repellent, Aggressive, Assertive and Masterful and are apt to repel each
other, and sometimes—not always—the Middle Signs, but strongly attract the Negative Poles. Then
come the Equatorial or Middle Signs—Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio, always in the order of the
elements. These are Fortunate Signs in that they attract both poles equally and each other. Last
are the Negative Signs,—Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius and Pisces, beginning with Fire and end­
ing with Water. These are the Attractive Poles—very much so to the Positive Poles and in a slightly
lesser degree to the Middle Signs.
A person Born Between March 21st and April 20th Has a Fiery Temper. For instance a
person born between March 21 and April 20 comes under the sign called Aries, named so
because the group of stars resemble the outline of a ram, is born in the Head Sign of the
Fire element, and partakes strongly of its fiery character.
Why You Are Attracted To Some People. In this way the Astrologer can account for
the unreasoning antipathies, or as unaccountable attractions, which man feels for his fellow
man. Just as fire and water are natural foes—so Fire People and Water People would find it
hard to agree. Air and Fire are good friends—and Earth and Air, if Air does not soar too
high for Earth to follow. Earth and Water sometimes make a paradise, sometimes a hell.
Air stirs Water into great commotion, generally to the achievement of much higher aims.
Like signs are almost invariably congenial except in cases where two head signs each strive
to rule the other, such as two people born under Taurus—each insisting on advising the
other. Some people—those who have studied Will Power and Self-Control, have so con­
quered their faults and tempers as to be lifted above this strife of elements, and so enabled
to become equally attractive to all. But the ordinary mortal is still in elemental chaos—or
in process of conquest only—and to such whether a person is naturally congenial or not
means everything as far as peace and happiness are concerned. Again, many people do not
know at all, or at best only faintly guess at their inner natures nd constitutional faults;
and to them i knowledge of their characteristic element, or elemental faults, by getting a
LIFE READING would be of inestimable value. Forewarned is forearmed, and to know
one’s faults is to be well along in the battle of conquering them.

Zodiac Talisman Rings Hand Engraved By A Master. On the next pages are listed some
of the finest as well as the most exclusive Zodiac Talisman Rings ever made. On each of
these Rings there is engraved the different Sign of the Zodiac. There are Twelve of these
Handsome Solid Gold Zodiac Talisman Rings. One for each month in the year. Your Sign
under the Zodiac is determined by the date of your birth. In other words, if you were born
between, October the 21st and November the 21st, your SIGN OF THE ZODIAC IS SCORPIO.
As there are Twelve different months in the year so there are Twelve different Signs, and by
looking over the following pages you will easily find your Birthday Zodiac Sign. All you
have to do is to know the date of your next Birthday, and, as stated above, this determines
your Zodiac Talisman Ring. For further particulars sec next pages.
If you wish a PARTIAL GENERAL LIFE READING, OR A SHORT DELINEATION OF
YOUR CHARACTER, according to the date of your birth which determines the Sign of the
Zodiac under which you were born, you may obtain it as follows: If you were born on
July 27th turn to the Zodiac Talisman Ring known as LEO, and above this Ring you will
find printed From July 20th to August 22nd. As you were born between these two dates
YOUR ZODIAC TALISMAN RING WILL BE LEO, and this Sign of the Zodiac, which is a
Lion, you will find Hand Engraved on your Zodiac Talisman Ring. Opposite the Ring you
will find printed a PARTIAL GENERAL LIFE READING according to the date cf your
birth, providing you were born as stated, between July the 20th and August the 22nd.
Names Of Noted People Born Under This Sign. You will also find below the Ring printed
the names and date of the birth of many noted people, who were born under this Sign.
To Illustrate Further. We believe from the above that it will be easy for any person
who knows the date of their next Birthday, to find their PARTIAL GENERAL LIFE READ­
ING on the next pages.
However, tc make the matter more plain, we will give another illustration. If you were
born on September 27th turn to the Zodiac Talisman Ring known as LIBRA, and above this
Ring you will find printed From September 20th to October 22nd. As you were born between
these twc dates YOUR ZODIAC TALISMAN RING WILL BE LIBRA, and this Sign of the
Zodiac, which is a Scale, you will find Hand Engraved on your Zodiac Talisman Ring. Oppo­
site the Ring you will find printed a PARTIAL GENERAL LIFE READING according to the
date of your birth, providing ycu were born as stated, between September the 20th and
October the 22nd.

FINE HAND ENGRAVED
ZODIAC TALISMAN RINGS
High Grade Birthday Rings. These fine Rings are sold at a very low price considering
their High Quality, Workmanship, Finish, and Engraving. A jeweler would charge as much
as $5.00 to Hand Engrave a Birthday Ring. This, cf course, does not include the cost for a
Solid Gold Ring. You understand, of course, that we must first have these Rings made from
Solid Gold and to have the Sign of the Zodiac Hand Engraved on them. It should be under­
stood, however, that the Hand Engraving of these Signs of The Zodiac cannot be done by an
ordinary jeweler, or engraver. He must be an expert. When this work is done by a high
priced specialist, that is, a real MASTER OF THE ENGRAVER’S ART the cost is very high.
These are absolute facts and you are to understand, if you send an-order, that you get the
full value of your money in a High Grade Solid Gold Hand Engraved Ring. Our Prices are
much lower than a jeweler would charge for Rings of this kind, if he were able to furnish
them; which, of course, he cannot unless you give him a special order and it is likely that
he would charge you no less than $2'0.00 for one of the Solid Gold Hand Engraved Rings.

(Rev. I-II)
In Zachariah, Seven lamps, and Seven pipes to those Seven lamps ; and Seven eyes running to
and fro through the whole earth; and Seven eyes on one stone; and the fast of the Seventh day
is turned into joy, and in Micah, Seven shepherds are raised up against the Assyrians. In the
Gospel, we read of Seven blessings ; and Seven virtues, to which Seven vices are opposed; Seven
petitions of the Lord’s Prayers ; Seven words of Christ upon the cross ; Seven words of the blessed
Virgin Mary; Seven loaves distributed by the Lord; Seven baskets of fragments ; Seven brothers
having one wife ; Seven disciples of the Lord who were fishers; Seven water pots of Cana of
Galilee ; Seven woes which the Lord threatens to hypocrites ; Seven devils cast out of the unclean
woman, and Seven wickeder devils taken in after that which was cast out; also, Seven years
Christ was fled into Egypt; and the Seventh hour the fever left the governor’s son.
In the Canonical Epistles, James describes Seven Degrees of Wisdom; and Peter, Seven
degrees of virtues. In the Acts, we reckon Seven deacons, and Seven disciples, chosen by the
Apostles ; in Revelations, there are many mysteries relating to this number ; for there we read of
Seven Candlesticks, Seven Stars, Seven Crowns, Seven Churches, Seven Spirits before the throne,
Seven Rivers of Egypt, Seven Seals, Seven Marks, Seven Horns, Seven Eyes. Seven Spirits of God,
Seven Angels with Seven Trumpets, Seven Horns of the dragon, Seven Heads of the dragon, which
had Seven Diadems, also Seven Plagues, and Seven Vials which were given to every one of the
Seven Angels, Seven Heads of the scarlet beast, Seven Mountains and Seven Kings sitting upon
them, and Seven Thunders uttered their voices.
Moreover, the Number Seven hath much power; as in natural so in Sacred Ceremonial, and
also m other things; therefore the Seven Days are related hither; also the Seven Planets, the
Seven Stars called Pleiades, the Seven Ages of the world, the Seven Changes of man, the Seven

440 THE de LAURENCE COMPANY
THE NUMBER SEVEN AND ITS SCALE
Of Various And Manifold Power. The Vehiculum Of Man’s Life
THE NUMBER SEVEN is of various and manifold power; for it consists of One and Six,
or of Two and Five, or of Three and Four; and it hath a unity, as it were the coupling
together of Two Threes: whence if we consider the several parts thereof, and the joining
together of them, without doubt we shall confess that it is, as well by the joining together of the
parts thereof as by its fulness apart, most full of all majesty. It might be called the velJculum
of man’s life, which it doth not receive from its parts so, as it perfects by its proper right
of its whole—for it contains body and soul; for the body consists of four elements and is
endowed with four qualities : also the number Three respects the soul, by reason of its threefold
power, viz. Rational, Irascible, and Concupisible.
The Number Seven, therefore, because it consists of Three and Four, joins the soul to the
body; and the virtue of this number relates to the generation of men, and it causes man to be
received, formed, brought forth, nourished, live, and indeed altogether to subsist; for when the
genital seed is received in the womb of the woman, if it remains there Seven Hours after the
effusion of it, it is certain that it will abide there for good; then the first Seven Days it is
coagulated, and is fit to receive the shape of a man; then it produces mature infants, which are
called infants of the Seventh Month, i. e., because they are born the Seventh Month.
After the birth, the Seventh Hour tries whether it will live or no—for that which will bear
the breath of the air after that hour, is conceived will live; after Seven Days, it casts off the
relics of the navel; after twice Seven Days, its sight begins to move after the light; in the
Third Seventh, it turns its eyes and whole face freely; after Seven Months, it breeds teeth;
after the Second Seventh Month, it sits without fear of falling; after the Third Seventh Month,
it begins to speak; after the Fourth Seventh Month, it stands strongly and walks; after the
Fifth Seventh Month, it begins to refrain sucking its nurse; after Seven Yrears, its first teeth
fall, and new are bred, fitter for harder meat, and its speech is perfected; after the Second
Seventh Year, boys wax ripe, and then it is a beginning of generation at the Third Seventh Year,
they grow to men in stature, and begin to be hairy, and become able and strong for generation ;
at the Fourth Seventh Year, they cease to grow taller; in the Fifth Seventh Year, they attain
to the perfection of their strength; the Sixth Seventh Year, they keep their strength; the
Seventh Seventh Year, they attain to their utmost discretion and wisdom, and the perfect age of
men; but when they come to he Tenth Seventh Year, where the Number Seven is taken for
a complete Number, then they come to the common term of life—the Prophet saying, our age is
Seventy Years.
The utmost heights, of a man’s body is seven feet. There are, also seven degrees in the
body, which complete the dimension of its altitude from the bottom to the top, viz. Marrow. Bone,
Nerve, Vein, Artery, Flesh, and Skin. There are Seven, which are called Black Members: the
Tongue, Heart, Lungs, Liver, Spleen, and the two Kidneys. There are, also, Seven principal
parts, of the Body*: the Head, Breast, Hands, Feet and the Privy Members. It is manifest,
concerning breath and food, that, without drawing of the breath, the life doth not remain above
Seven Minutes; and they that are starved with famine, live not above Seven Days. The veins, also,
and arteries, as physicians say, are moved by the Seventh Number.
Judgments in diseases are made with greater manifestation upon the Seventh Day, which
physicians call critical, i. e. judicial.
Of Seven portions God creates the soul;—the soul, also, receives the body by Seven Degrees.
All difference of voices proceeds to the Seventh Degree, after which there is the same
revolution. Again, there are Seven modulations of the voices: Ditonus, Semiditonus, Diatesseron,
Diapente with a tone, Diapente with a Half Tone, and Diapason.
There are also, in Celestials, a most potent power of the Number Seven; for seeing there
are Four Corners of the Heavens diametrically looking one towards the other, which indeed is
accounted a most full and powerful aspect, and consists of the Number Seven; for it is made
with the Seventh Sign, and makes a Cross, the most powerful figure of all, of which I shall
speak in its due place—but this you must not be ignorant of, that the Number Seven hath a great
communion with the cross.
By the same radiation and number the Solstice is distant from Winter, and the Winter
Equinoctium Lom the Summer, all which are done by Seven Signs. There are also Seven Circles
in the Heavens, according to the longitudes of the axle-tree. There are Seven Stars about the
Arctic Pole, greater and lesser ; the Seven Planets, according to those Seven Days, constituting
a week. The Moon is the Seventh of the Planets, and next to us, observing this number more
than the rest, this number dispensing the motion and light thereof; for in twenty-eight days, it
runs round the compass of the whole Zodiac ; which number of days, the Number Seven with its
Seven Terms, viz. from One to Seven, doth make and fill up as much as the several numbers,
by adding to the antecedents, and makes four times Seven Days, in which the Moon runs through
and about all the longitude and latitude of the Zodiac, by measuring and measuring again: with
the like Seven Days it dispense its light, by changing it; for the first Seven Days, unto the middle
as it were of the divided world, it increases; the second Seven Days; it fills its whole orb
with light; the third, by decreasing, is again contracted into a divided orb; but after the fourth
Seven Days, it is renewed with the last diminution of its light; and by the same Seven Days, it
disposes the increase and decrease of the sea: for in the first Seven of the increase of the
moon, it is by little and little lessened; in the second, by degrees increased; but the third is
like the first, and the fourth does the same as the second. It is also applied to Saturn, which
ascending from the lower, is the Seventh Planet, which betokens rest; to which the Seventh
Day is ascribed, which signifies the Seven Thousandth, wherein, as St. John says the dragon
and satan being bound, men shall be quiet and lead a peaceable life.
THE SECOND BOOK OF THE KINGS
The leprous person that was to be cleansed, was sprinkled Seven Times with the blood of
a sparrow ; and Elisha the Prophet, as it is written in the Second Book of Kings, saith unto the
leprous person—“Go, and wash thyself Seven Times in the River Jordan, and thy flesh shall be
made whole, and thou shalt be cleansed. The Number Seven is a number of repentance and
remission. And Christ, with Seven Petitions, finished his speech to our satisfaction.
It is called the Number Of Liberty, because the Seventh Year, the Hebrew servant did
challenge liberty for himself.

Alsoit. is consecrated to the Holy Ghost, which the Prophet Isaiah describes to be sevenfold,
according to his gift, viz. the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and
strength, the spirit of knowledge and holiness, the spirit of fear of the Lord, which we read
in Zachariah to be the Seven eyes of God
But in the days of the voice of the Seventh Angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery
of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. (Rev. 10-7)
And the Seventh Angel sounded; and there were great voices in Heaven, saying. The kingdoms
of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever
and ever. (Rev. 11-15)
And the Seven Angels came out of the Temple, having the Seven plagues, clothed in pure
and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles. (Rev. 15-6)
There are also Seven Angels. Spirits standing in the presence of God, as we read in Tobias, and
in the Revelations Seven Lamps did burn before the throne of God, and Seven Golden Candlesticks,
and in the middle thereof was one like unto the Son of Man, and he had in his right hand Seven
Stars. Also, there were Seven Spirits before the throne of God, and Seven Angels stood before
the throne, and there were given to them Seven Trumpets. And he saw a lamb having Seven
Horns and Seven Eyes; and he saw the Book sealed with Seven Seals; and when the Seventh
Seal was opened, there was made silence in Heaven.
And I turned to see the loice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden
candlesticks. (Rev. 1-12)
And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment
down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. (Rev. 1-13)
And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword:
and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. (Rev. 1-16)
And when he had opened the Seventh Seal, there was silence in heaven about the spaee of
half an hour.
And I saw the Seven Angels which stood before God; and to them were given Seven Trumpets.
(Rev. 8. 1-2.)
And the Seven Angels which had the Seven Trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
(Rev. 8-3)
Now, by all that has been said, it is apparent that the NUMBER SEVEN, amongst the other
numbers, may be deservedly said to be most full of efficacy. Moreover, the NUMBER SEVEN
hath great conformity with the Number Twelve; for as three and four make seven, so thrice
four makes twelve, which are the numbers of the Celestial Planets and signs resulting from the
same root; and by the number three partaking of the Divinity, and by the number four of the
nature of inferior things.
There is in sacred writ a very great observance of this number before all others, and many,
and very great are the mysteries thereof; many I have decreed to reckon up here, repeating them
out of holy writ, by which it will easily appear that the NUMBER SEVEN doth signify a certain
fulness of Sacred Mysteries; for we read, in Genesis, that the Seventh Day was the day of
rest of the Lord; that Enoch, a pious holy man, was the Seventh from Adam; and that there
was another Seventh man from Adam, a wicked man, by name Lamech, that had two wives;
and that the sin of Cain should be abolished the Seventh Generation, as it is written—Caln shall
be punished Sevenfold; and that he who shall slay Cain, shall be revenged Sevenfold; to which
the master of the history collects that there were Seven sins of Cain.
Of all clean beasts Seven, and Seven were brought into the ark, as also of fowls; and after
Seven days the Lord rained upon the earth; and upon the Seventh Day the fountains of the deep
were broken up, and the waters covered the earth.
Abraham gave to Abimelech Seven ewe lambs; and Jacob served Seven years for Leah,
and Seven more for Rachel; and Seven days the people of Israel bewailed the death of Jacob.
Morover, we read in the same place, of Seven kine ; and Seven ears of corn; Seven years of
plenty, and Seven years of scarcity.
In Exodus, the Sabbath of Sabbaths, the holy rest to the Lord, is commanded to be on the
Seventh day; also, on the Seventh day Moses ceased to pray. On the Seventh day there shall
be a solemnity of the Lord; the Seventh year the servant shall go out free; Seven days let the
calf and the lamb be with its dam; the Seventh year, let the ground that hath been sown six
years be at rest; the Seventh Day shall be a Holy Sabbath, and a rest; the Seventh day, because
it is the Sabbath, shall be called Holy.
And he had in his hands a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his
left foot on the earth. (Rev. 10-2)
And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried. Seven Thundera
uttered their voices. (Rev. 10-3)
And when the Seven Thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard
a voice from heaven saying unto me. Seal up those things which the Seven Thunders uttered, and
write them not. (Rev. 10-4)
In Leviticus, the Seventh Day also shall be more observed, and be more holy; and the first
day of the Seventh Month shall be a Sabbath of memorial; Seven days shall the sacrifices be
offered to the Lord; Seven days shall the holy days of the Lord be celebrated; Seven days in
a year everlastingly in the generations. In the Seventh month you shall celebrate feasts, and
shall dwell in tabernacles Seven days; Seven times he shall sprinkle himself before the Lord
that hath dipped his fingers in blood; he that is cleansed from the leprosy, shall dip Seven times
in the blood of a sparrow; Seven days shall she be washed with running water that is menstruous ;
Seven times he shall dip his finger in the blood of a bullock; Seven times I will smite you for
your sins.
The mystery of the Seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden
candlesticks. The Seven stars are the angels of the Seven churches: and the Seven candlesticks
which thou sawest are the Seven churches. (Rev. 1-20)
And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write: These things saith he that hath the Seven
Spirits of God, and the Seven stars; I know thy workss, that thou hast a name that thou llvest,
and art dead. (Rev. 3-1)
In Deuteronomy, Seven people possessed the Land of Promise. There is also, a Seventh
year of remission; and Seven Candles set up on the south side of the Candlesticks.
We read in Numbers that the sons of Israel offered up Seven ewe lambs without spots;
and that Seven days they did eat unleavened bread; and that sin was expiated with Seven lambs
and a goat; and that the Seventh day was celebrated, and Holy, and the first day of the Seventh
month was observed and kept holy; and the Seventh month of the Feast of Tabernacles; and
Seven calves were offered on the Seventh day.
Balaam erected Seven Altars; for Seven Days Mary, the sister of Aaron, sent forth
lepers out of the camp; for Seven days he that touched a dead carcass was unclean.
In Jush”a. Seven priests carried the Ark of the Covenant before the host; and Seven days
they went around the cities; and Seven Trumpets were carried by the Seven priests; and on
the Seventh day, the Seven priests sounded the Trumpets.

THE LUCKY SEVEN
Ancient Talisman Rings
LUCKY SEVEN TALISMAN RINGS. Engraved upon the Monogram Plate o. these
Rings are the Seven Greek Vowels, which Symbolize the Seven Planets. This Lucky Seven
Symbol the Ancients believed when Engraved on a Ring, would keep them Hopeful and
Optimistic regarding their future success in ail Enterprises; protect them from Tempations
and make them Lucky; evei- reminding its wearer of the Seven Planes.
These Lucky Seven Rings find favor with, and are well liked by those who are interested
in High Grade Sporting Events such as, Swimming, Skating, Boxing, Fencing, Rowing,
Running, Baseball, Football, and other Athletic or outdoor amusements.
They have also become very popular with those who follow Horse Racing, or are inter­
ested in and like to watch the outcome of Games such as, Mah Jong. Chess, Checkers,
Dominoes, Dice, Cards, Lottery Numbers, and Drawings. Indeed, most any person would
be proud to own one of these Handsome Rings, as they are of the highest quality and are
sold for less than you would pay for ordinary Rings of their grade and weight.
Amalgamation Of Beliefs. The Etruscans, Greeks, and Romans were all familiar with
and great believers in the Virtue of Talismans and Amulets. A belief based not only on the
Symbols of their own Faith, but largely influenced by the beliefs of the surrounding nations;
that of the Egyptians being particularly noticeable. Amongst the earliest and most popu­
lar Talismans were Solid Gold and Silver Rings with Inscriptions Engraved upon their Crest
or Monogram Plate. These were used as Talismans and Seals. In the course of the
amalgamation of beliefs, many had great faith in the virtue and efficacy of Talismans and
Seals, and a much worn Talisman at that time was The Lucky Seven Ring which is a
Symbol of the Seven Planets. This very same Lucky Seven Symbol is Hand Engraved on
all of the Rings shown here.

For Ladies And Gentlemen
Good Luck, Success, Fortune Ladies’ Egyptian
Black Lucky Ring
Many have read of the singular Magic of the Egyptians and their great belief and
faith in certain Talisman Rings and Phylacteries, as a means of helping them to ward
off disease, an evil influence, as well as to help them become successful. Shown above is
the famous EGYPTIAN BLACK LUCKY RING. The ancient Egyptians believed that a
BLACK LUCKY’ RING possessed some strange unknown power, and if worn would help
them to overcome Spells, Charms, and an Evil Influence. As far as is known no one has
ever offered an explanation of why the old Egyptians, as well as people in all ages of the
world, even down to the present day, believed in the Spiritual or Magic Power of Lucky
Talisman Rings. The Egyptians were great believers in these things, and their many
precious jewels were always used for some particular purpose such as Divine Illumina­
tion, Spirit-Seeing, as well as to forestall and ward off bad luck. Indeed, in all ages of the
world it has been believed that certain rings possess some singular Magical Power. There
seems to be a universal belief in the efficacy of the Talisman Rings of ancient Egypt.
Belief and unbounded faith in Talismans and Amulets has prevailed among the
people of every nation in all ages of the world. The Bible tells of a Seal Ring and how
it was used as a Talisman. Genesis mentions Signet Rings which were worn as Talismans
in ancient Egypt. The ancient EGYPTIAN BLACK LUCKY RING was composed of pure
fine gold, inlaid with genuine Dead Black Onyx. Above on this page is shown our famous
EGYPTIAN BLACK LUCKY RING.
In ancient times, so relates the Bible, Rings, Talismans, and Amulets were in uni­
versal use owing to the people’s infallible belief and faith in their efficacy.
The ancients, and most especially the Egyptians, used Lucky Rings as Talismans
against disease and misfortune. The EGYPTIAN BLACK LUCKY RING was worn by those
who had an infallible hope and constant faith that it would be the means of bringing to
them a high Spiritual Influence. It is reported that the BLACK LUCKY RING was well
like by both Egyptian men and women who were concerned about love affairs. Indeed,
as stated above, the Egyptians had great faith in Rings and Talismans.
Belief in Talismans is coeval in age with the world. Extensive research shows that
this belief dates back to the early history of man. The old Egyptians, tribes of Israel,
the Chaldeans, the Grand Zoroastorian Nation, and the Flindoos; all believed in Talisman
Rings as a harbinger of good fortune and proof against misfortune. This belief is found
in both the Hebraic and Christian Bible.
History shows tITat the Ancients had great belief in Talismans against disease, an
evil influence, or misfortune. The wearer of any kind of a Talisman, however, so history
tells us, must possess an infallible hope, have constant faith in the Talisman, and have
his mind lifted up to higher Spiritual Influences if results were expected.
Talisman Rings, as Tokens or Symbols, they believed, conveyed joy and confidence
to their owners, and were thought to give warning of Coming Events, inspiring Courage
and Faith in the fearful; and the romance and tragedies in which they have played a
part, together with their marked influence on the lives of individuals and nations, inten­
sifies our interest in them so that it is little wonder that Faith in the Mysterious Properties
ascribed to Guard Rings, Lucky Rings, and Talisman Rings, should have survived the
growth of ages and still find so many believers in all countries. The Philosophers of
thousands of years ago, understanding the suitability of Talismans as a medium for the
transmission of Spiritual Forces and Vibrations, invested them with much importance,
attributing to them Spiritual Powers, Special Characteristics, and Medicinal and Curative
qualities.

The sciences of Astrology and Talismanic Magic were well known to the
old Egyptians, many of whom wore a Guard Ring or an Egyptian Con­
queror Ring, inside of which were engraved the words “HARM ME NOT.” The;e wore1
were engraved upon the inside of these Rings because of the belief that they would help

The Egyptian mind has even today a most important influence upon our modern
civilization as far as Talismans, Guard Rings, and Conqueror Rings are concerned.
Among the most interesting of the many Egyptian Rings is a Talisman wedding ring.

of a ring; and the Egyptian at his marriage placed one of these pieces of gold on his wife’s
finger as a token of his entrusting her with all his property. Early Christians saw no
harm in following this custom; and in our own marriage ceremony the mani places the
same plain ring of gold on his bride’s finger when he says “with all my worldly goods I
thee endow.”
It was one of the duties of the old Egyptian priests of Philae to throw a Guard Talis­
man Ring into the River Nile once a year so there would be a bountiful overflow.
The spread of the faith and belief, throughout the world, in Emblems, Seals. Talismans,
Guard Rings, and Conqueror Rings with the words “HARM ME NOT” engraved on the
inside of them, is something to impress the minds of the thoughtful men and women of
today.

A Talisman of the Dark Ages
The early Christians had great faith and belief in the power of nu mbers, and their
magical formulas were largely composed of letters having numerical values, usually
expressed in Hebrew. Sometimes Greek letters were used, as in THE TABLE
OF JUPITER, which, combined with astrological formulas, were believed to attract
influences of the Angels and Intelligences ruling through the Planets, the houses
of the Zodiac, their triplicities and degrees.
The Hierarchy of Divine Power
The Laws of the Cabala were the source and inspiration of many talismans, which
is readily understandable when it is known that according to its precepts the Holy
Intelligence was believed to rule by acting first through the nine orders of the Angelic
Hosts and blessed souls, and through them to the Celestial Spheres, Planets and
Mankind. Lower degrees of Angels and celestial influences, known as Intelligences,
ruling each element, nation, language, animal and vegetable life, atmospheric condi­
tions, emotions and aspirations.
Divine Names and the Number Thirty-Four
THE TABLE OF JUPITER TALISMAN contains sixteen numbers which total up to
thirty-four whichever way they are added. These, with the Divine Names around
them, are to be inscribed on a plate of silver or gold, and, according to THE BOOK
OF TALISMANS, was worn for riches, favor, peace, concord, to appease enemies, and
to confer honor and dignities.
The Ten Names of God
Some of The Ten Names of God are inscribed on THE TABLE OF JUPITER TALIS­
MAN. These Names were used to attract the virtues and powers they represent, or
to accomplish some desire signified. Those on THE TABLE OF JUPITER TALIS­
MAN were used for the following purposes: Elohim signified providence and under­
standing; Adonai, the God of Hosts, triumph and victory, justice and eternity;
Sabaoth, piety and agreement.

The desire to communicate with spirits by possessing a proper Talisman, or burning
Incense or Candles as an invocation is older than history; it connects with Ineradicable prin­
ciples in human nature, which have been discussed too often for it to be necessary to recite
them here.
There is no extant Ritual, as there is no Real Instruction of the Secret of Mystical
Procedure, or the essence of any Mystical Doctrine taught anywhere only in “THE GREAT
BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC AND EAST INDIAN OCCULTISM,” by that
famous Adept, de LAURENCE. The reason is not because there is, or can reasonably be,
any indlcible secret, but because the knowledge in question is in the custody of Great
Adepts like de LAURENCE, who have taken effectual measures for its protection; and
though, from time to time, some Secrets or Initiation have filtered through printed books
into the world at large, the Real Mysteries have never been taught only by de LAURENCE
in “THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC, AND EAST INDIAN OCCULT­
ISM,” which is, without doubt, the most wonderful volume ever published. This is the
reason why de LAURENCE’S books have sold upwards to 30 years and have had no com­
petition. This great man’s books are known to be official.
Until de LAURENCE issued “THE GREAT BOOK OF MAGIC ART, HINDU MAGIC,
AND EAST INDIAN OCCULTISM,” the SECRET INSTRUCTION, and the MYSTERIES dis­
closed therein, remained as unprinted literature.

Ceremonial Incense for Use with Conjuration, Ceremonies and Suffumigations for
Invocation of Spirits; Receiving of Oracles in Dreams, Conjurations, Exor­
cisms, Benedictions, Talismanic Operations, Consecrations of the Bond
of Spirits, and their Adjurations and Casting Out.
Oriental Temple Incense is one of those enchantingly exquisite suffumes whose
odor is not only most pleasing but its spiritual generation of power and binding of spirits is
most secure, of which all who have used it have had ample proof.
At all times, and in all places, this Temple Incense gives forth a subtle, power-
graaf ful and beautifully fragrant odor, stronger and more agreeable than any incense or
invoking powder yoii have ever used or seen. This sweet-smelling, Mystical,
"Soul-Vision" and “Spirit-Sight" inducing subtle ceremonial compound is to be
JyLfefe' used exclusively by sincere and earnest investigators. Those who wish to be lulled
into a "Soul-Vision" or Clairvoyant state where they can witness any induced
Astral phenomena or experience those wierd “out-of-the-body” sensations, so much loved
by the Oriental, certainly could do no better than try a Packet of Temple Incense, especially
if they are using a Magic Mirror or Crystal, or sitting for development.
This is not a substitute, such as is sold in every city and country drug shop. It is
genuine Oriental Temple Incense, the same fragrant, aromatic compound and essential
t production used ages and ages ago. It really and truly diffuses an agreeable, dreamy
fragrance, most pleasing to the senses and inducing to soul-vision and spirit-sight.
Used abroad, in courts and palaces of high-caste titled Oriental people, also by the
priests in the Lamarsaries and Hindu Occult Chambers. One packet should do for
one hundred or more sittings, so you see it is very inexpensive, costing only two
cents per sitting.
Our Ancient Temple Incense is highly recommended for use among spiritual­
ists, those holding circle, Public Mediums and those who do a professional business.
Imported in sealed original Oriental Packets only.
Temple Incense has for centuries been used in all high-grade Invocations, Ceremonial,
Magical and Occult Rites of the Orient and the Far East. Its ingredients were among the
first secret preparations to be used by thos,e learned Arabian chemists to whom the world is
deeply indebted for Oriental Perfumes and Incense.

TEMPLE INCENSE
WITH DAILY RECITALS
By de Laurence
Taking the days of the week, TEMPLE INCENSE, with the accompanying recitals, may
be employed:
SUNDAY.—Burn Temple Incense for ten minutes, and say in a low, firm voice Psalm 55.
If this is done each Sunday for some weeks, you should be successful in all your undertakings.
Repeating the same Psalm seven times, the evil set against you by
your enemies will, it is said, be turned to naught. Those who desire
some particular wish granted will find this day and Psalm good if
Temple Incense is burned as directed herein and the Psalm repeated
twelve times.
MONDAY.—If you w'ish to receive knowledge through a dream,
purify yourself by fasting twenty-four hours, and bathing, and re­
peat Psalm 23 seven times while the Incense is burning. Burne Tem­
ple Incense and repeat this Psalm between the hours of 11 and 12
o’clock at night.
Temple Incense can be used on any day of the week, as di­
rected herein, though the best days for burning it are Sunday and
Wednesday, between the hours of 11 and 12 at night. Being a moon­
scent, it is said, therefore, to possess more power on the days dedi­
cated to the lunar goddess.
The following prayer should be said after repeating Psalm 23,
between the hours of 11 and 12 on Monday night, as directed in the
preceding paragraph: Oh Great and Powerful spirit of the world
(Godf), notwithstanding Thy unutterable mighty, hidden power,
exaltation and glory, Thou wilt lend a listening ear to the prayer of
Thy humblest and faithful disciple, and wilt fulfill his desires. Hear my earnest prayer, Thy
Great Universal Spirit, and let it be pleasing to Thy holy will to reveal unto me in a dream,
whether (here the affair of which a correct knowledge is desired must be plainly stated) as
Thou didst often reveal through dreams the fate of our forefathers. Grant me my petition for
the sake of Thy adorable name, Jah. Amen. Selah! Repeat this prayer from memory four times,
burning Incense all the time.
TUESDAY.—The fumigation appropriate to the day is also Temple Incense. If you are
troubled by your enemies,—open or secret—repeat Psalms 53, 54 and 55 as soon as your Temple
Incense begins to burn. If it be desired to quiet and overcome your enemies, then repeat Psalm 53
ten times. Do this between the hours of 11 and 12 at night, if possible.
If you wish to be not only secure from their malice, but also to revenge yourself upon them,
you may repeat Psalm 54 six times, though the spirit is to be deprecated.
WEDNESDAY.—The fumigation for this day is Temple Incense, and it may be used if
you are about to enter college, or have a'case in court, or hold converse with wise men, or if you
wish to gain wisdom. Its burning may be accompanied by the repeating of Psalm 134. You may
repeat this Psalm five times.
THURSDAY.—Temple Incense is sacred to this day. It is said that if one wishes to pro­
cure love of women, let him repeat Psalms 45 and 46, while burning Temple Incense. As the
ancient writer hath it: “The 45th and 46th Psalms are said to possess the virtue of making peace
between man and wife, and especially tame cross and unreasonable wives.” The saying is,
namely: “Whoever has a scolding wife, let him pronounce the 45th Psalm over pure genuine
burning Temple Incense, when his wife, in the future, will be more lovable and friendly.” But
if a man has innocently incurred the enmity of his wife, and desires a proper return of conjugal
love and peace, let him pray the 45th Psalm over burning Temple Incense ten times, and, it i£
said, married love will return again.
FRIDAY.—-Temple Incense is the fumigation used by many who wish to increase in good
fortune, might and power. While it is burning repeat Psalm 112 seven consecutive times. Should
you desire to gain the love, respect, friendship or good will of another, you may repeat the 131th
Psalm nine consecutive times while burning Temple Incense, and no doubt you will be well
pleased with the results.
SATURDAY.—Burn Temple Incense. If afflicted with an incurable disease or troubled by
an evil spirit, and you wish to obtain relief, you may recite Psalm 90 four times and also Psalm 91,
the latter being particularly powerful, so it is claimed.
Temple Incense is said to be also a powerful antidote against all evil influences, and its
formula has been kept a close secret for centuries. For strengthening the memory, rendering
concentration easier, acquiring knowledge, meditating, steadying thoughts, etc., this preparation
can be used to great benefit.
To induce trance, for prophesying, Temple Incense is without doubt the best fumigation
known to man. Place one-half of a teaspoonful of Temple Incense in an Incense burner; light it
and, closing the eyes, inhale slowly. Let the mind dwell upon whatever thought or subject you
desire information.
If you wish to be sucessful in business, or whenever you have an important appointment to
keep, or interview someone from whom you wish to secure a favor, burn a small amount of
Temple Incense and without doubt you will be well pleased with the results.
To induce hypnosis or lull the irritations of any nervous or bad-tempered persons whom you
have to meet, the burning of this Incense is said to help wonderfully. If suffering from depression,
this fumigation is said to have a powerful effect in restoring the animal spirits.
t God is the greatest power in the universe, because He is the source aad sum of all powers in their highest mode of
manifestation. God is therefore absolute consciousness, absolute love, and absolute wisdom. If we wish to accomplish any­
thing great, the first requirement is the presence of God, because Ho is man’s understanding and power, and resides in man.
But God cannot be approached by an intellect that is without love. God is love, and is only attracted by love. We cannot
know the principle of love, unless we love it with our heart, and the more we desire- it, the more will we be able to compre­
hend with the heart what this principle is. The love of God is therefore a power transcending the lower nature of man; it
cannot develop itself out of the animal elements of man, but it is a gift from the universal fountain of love, in the same
sense as sunshine cannot grow out of the earth, but comes from above. God lives in the hearts of men, and if we desire to
love Him, we must love all that is good in humanity. The love of humanity is the beginning of the knowledge of God. The
intellect is the greatest possession of mortal man, and an intellect that rises to the source of all knowledge by the power of
love may know God and all the mysteries of Nature, and become godlike itself; but an intellect without love leads into error,
grovels in darkness, and goes to perdition. An intellect combined with love for the supreme good leads to wisdom; an intel­
lect without love leads to the powers of evil. —de Laxtrence.

THE HOLY OF HOLIES
Christ Again Restored To Humanity The Assurance Of immortality. He
Elevated The Spiritual Being To A Temple Of Holy Fire, And
Made It A Living Altar And Incense To An Eternal Peace
The men of God under the old
Covenant, who performed such great
wonders, and accomplished such
wonderful works, were always
rather more on the side of humanity
than that of the divine, that is, they
always evinced only single powers
and perfections. The universal ex­
pression of full perfection became
an absolute reality only through
Christ. He it was who first un­
barred the new door—severed the
chains of slavery, and pointed out
the true image of perfection and
wisdom in all their fullness to man.
Christ again restored to humanity
the assurance of immortality. He
elevated the spiritual being to a
Temple of Holy Fire, and made it
a living altar and Incense to an
eternal peace.
There are beings for whom the
Redeemer has already come, others
for whom He comes now, and still
others for whom He is yet to come.
Since His advent all things have be­
come simplified, and He will simplify
Himself more and more until every­
thing earthly will vanish. A great
sabbath of universal love and peace,
as it was in the creation, will sig­
nalize the end. He entered the Holy
of Holies as the true High Priest,
and restored to the elect through
His spirit,, not only the Lost Word of the Old Book, but gave them a new one, richer in con­
tent for the healing of all evil, and for making them invulnerable. In addition
He gave them the Holy Incense of prayer, and showed them, that without it they would
be -unable, except through Him alone, to obtain every principle of life. He performed on earth
what is found above. He was constantly active, as the highest embodiment of wisdom, in spiritual
and temporal acts of charity, and united both in one. But this could only be when He himself was
joined in this unity on earth in which He was joined from all eternity. In the end He crowned his
work by conferring a spirit which created a knowledge and vitality that were never experienced
before. He chose an object of sense as a channel through which to communicate the highest
powers of life. Even man may transfer his weak powers on any object: how much more must
the mysteries (baptism by water, the communion through bread and wine), instituted by Himself,
have possessed a power which man could never possess. The action of the Holy Communion is
at the same time corporeal, spiritual and divine, and all things therein contained must become
spirit and life, because He himself, who instituted it, was the spirit and the life.
Each true Christian is a living expression of this doctrine and an image of its author. He
possesses fervor enough to absorb everything that is diseased and dissolute, and his life is a
daily offering in humility and holy fear before God, for the mysteries of God are only revealed to
those who fear Him. The true Christian relies upon the commandments of the author of his
name. Only such a man can enter into the counsel of peace. If the highest human wisdom
continues to be a tottering and perishable structure, a single ray of the sun of the world will
make him purer and wiser than all the wise of this earth. Since there are mysteries in every
religion, so there are certain things of indescribable power and of the highest weight in Christianity
which cannot be explained. So long as these were known only to the true possessors as a
sanctuary, Christianity was at rest. But after the great of earth began to set their feet within
this sanctuary and desired to see with unprepared eyes; so soon as it was converted into a
political machine, divisions and uncertainties ensued. Upon this came the High Priests who
separated themselves farther and farther from original purity, and in this resulted in an
incongrugous conglomeration of religious teachings. Many so-called teachers have multiplied these
evils by their subtleties, separating that which was united, and covering with darkness and death
what was formerly light and life. If even a few traces of purity, zeal and power could be seen
here and there, they could accomplish nothing, because the horrors of desolation had already
become too general and were preferred by too many. These corruptions were the cause, in
later times, that the structure of Christianity was sapped in its very foundations. Only one step
from Deism to utter ruin. Out of Deism grew a still worse brood of materialists, who declared
that all connection of humanity with higher powers to be idle imagination, and who did not even
believe in their own existence. It was very seldom that the generations of the earliest times
sinned through great enterprises ; those of later periods, on the contrary, sinned through nullity.
But there is a truth whose sanctity cannot be shaken, and which will remain firm as long as the
world exists.
But if man, through his reconciliation and return to God, and through a true Christian life,
receives the powers which the Saviour promised to his followers, namely, “To expel serpents,
to heal the sick, and to cast out devils,” and this to the same extent that he did himself,
(John xiv. 12) and if such a Christian man can in deed and in truth perform greater wonders
than one who lives in a state of sin (and we find this to be the case not only with the apostles,
but with all godly men of every age), then we must accord to man what is human. I have
already spoken of the Christian method of healing, and inasmuch as I refer back to it in this
place, the fact will not admit of a doubt, that the healing by Christ as well as by the apostles
really had reference to higher spiritual powers. They never obtained the means to heal
diseases from the apothecary, neither did they possess any secret remedies or magical essences ;
they possessed an inherent power to heal diseases, and by words they cast out devils, restored
the dead to life, healed, through prayer and the laying on of hands, the lame and paralytic, and
caused the blind to see, and the dumb to speak. To prove this, not however to represent them
solely as magnetic cures, but to examine them as humanly Divine Wonders, I will mention a few
cures performed by Christ and his apostles as they stand recorded by the Evangelists and the
Acts of the Apostles: (Continued on next page)

JESUS PUTS FORTH HIS HAND
“When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. And, behold,
there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately
his leprosy was cleansed.” (Matt. viii. 1-3.) .
“And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching
him to heal his servant. Amd Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him. The centurion
answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof: but speak
the word only and my servant shall be healed. When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said unto
them that followed: Verily"I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it unto thee. And his servant was healed in the
selfsame hour.” (Matt. viii. 5-13.)
“And when Jesus had come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother laid, and sick of a
fever. And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and he arose and ministered unto him.
(Matt. viii. 14, 15.) a
“When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils:
and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick.” (Matt. viii. 16; Mark 1. 32.)
“And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed and Jesus seeing
their faith said unto the sick of the palsy: Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.”
(Matt. ix. 2; Mark ii. 3.)
“And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came
behind him, and touched the hem of his garment: For she said within herself, If I may but
touch his garment, I shall be whole. But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,
Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith has made thee whole. And the woman was made whole
from that hour.” (Matt. ix. 20-22.)
“And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels and the people making
a noise, he said unto them, Give place ; for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed
him to scorn. But when the people were put forth he went in, and took her by the hand, and
the maid arose.”
“And when Jesus departed from thence, two blind men followed him. And when he was
come into the house, the blind men came unto him: And Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that
I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. Then touched he their eyes, saying,
According to your faith be it unto you. And their eyes were opened.” (Matt. ix. 27-30.)
The man with the withered hand he healed through the words’: “Stretch forth thine hand,”
and it was restored whole like the other. (Matt, xi! 10-13.)
“And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country
round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased; and besought him that they might
only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.” (Matt,
xiv. 35, 36.)
The daughter of the woman of Canaan, who was grievously vexed with a devil was restored
through the faith of the woman. (Matt. xv. 22-28.)
“And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb,
maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them.” (Matt. xv. 30;
Luke vii. 22.)
THE TRUE RELATION OF MAN TO THE OMNIPOTENT
The Bible may be justly styled The Holy Scriptures, because it contains the knowledge of
the Saints, while at the same time, it unites and harmonizes the word and deed, doctrine and
action.
It points out the true relation of man to the Omnipotent—it affords the most direct reference
to the great truths of the spiritual and intellectual; it treats of the origin of the universe and
its laws, through which all things have to be brought to light—of the anterior and posterior
history of mankind—of his future destiny and how to attain it; of the living and visible agents
which God employs in the great work of redemption, and, finally, of the most Exalted of all
beings—of the world’s Saviour, who was a universal expression in his own person, and who
exhibited all Divine Power and action in one person.
In The Holy Bible we find a connected chain of acts and events—in fact, a Divine and life­
like drama. The Bible contains the light which illuminates every dark phase in life; it is the
groundwork of all human actions, the guiding star of the earthly to the eternal—of the intellectual
to the Divine, the aim and end of all knowledge. It is the first of the three Great Bights, guiding
and governing our faith, and bears no relation to the other two Great Lights of the angel which
shall make these actions lawful.
The Bible is also more instructive and helpful in reference to the life, health and spiritual
well-being of mankind than all other books taken together. An account will, therefore, be given
of the many strange and remarkable things which took place as set forth in the Scriptures.
Particular attention is also called to the healing of the sick according to Scriptural teachings.
THE HOLY DECALOGUE OR THE WRITTEN LAW FROM GOD
Mankind received the Holy Decalogue or the written law, from God. In addition to the laws
which God gave, to Moses, engraven upon stone. He also gave to him certain verbal laws, by which
through his protracted stay upon the mountain Sinai, where all doctrines, explanations of mys­
teries, Holy names of God and the angels, and particularly how to apply this knowledge to the
best interest of man, were entrusted to him. All these doctrines, which God pronounced good,
but which were not generally made known, and which in the course of time were called The Kabala,
or Traditions, Moses communicated, during his life, to Joshua, his successor. Joshua handed them
over to the elders, the elders gave them to the judges, and from the judges they descended to the
prophets. The prophets entrusted them to the men of the great synagogue, and these gave them
unto the wise men, and so the Kabala was handed down from one to the other-—from mouth to
mouth—to the present day. Therefore, do> we know that in the Bible are many names of the
Most High and his angels, besides deep mysteries, which may be applied to the welfare of man,
but which, on account of the perverseness of humanity and to guard against their abuse, have been
hidden from the great mass of human beings.
Everything here stated is as clear as the sun, and needs no further proof, and it is equally
clear and incontrovertible that the All-merciful God gave the Bible in the beginning to promote
the best interests of the soul and the body of man at the same time. Therefore has God endowed
man with exalted talents, powers and virtues that, with a rational use of which, man may protect
himself from danger, when no other help is at hand, and save himself simply by uttering the words
of the living God. On this account, the expression “For it is thy life,” occurs frequently in the
Bible. And Solomon says in his Proverbs, vi. 22. “When thou goest it shall lead thee, and when
thou sleepest it shall keep thee.”
That the Psalms are most Holy and Worthy will not be called in question. Our wise men
declare, “He who will daily live closer to God, who deserves to unite his soul with Him, and who
is willing to live in the closest communion with Him, should often pray the Psalms with fervor and
devotion.” “Happy the man who does this daily and hourly, for his reward will be; great ’ The
Psalms are formed and divided into Five Books, and in them are many names of the Most High
Majesty of God and his angels, besides, many mysteries are hidden.

Yes, dear reader, you must not doubt. Through a pious life and by a rational use of the
Psalms you may obtain by grace of God, the favor of your employer, men in high offices, judges
and magistrates, and the love of your fellow-men. By the Psalms and True Faith and Belief in
God you will be enabled to protect yourself from danger, to escape suffering, and to promote your
own welfare.
The correctness of this is also established by the teachings of the old wise men, who assure
us, that many of our famous forefathers availed themselves of apparently supernatural means from
time to time, to protect their best interests. Let it suffice for you to believe that the Almighty
God has given in His revealed word true and unexampled talents and power, and that, in an extreme
case of necessity, we are permitted to make use of this gift of God, for our own and our
neighbor’s welfare. As for example, to cast out evil spirits, to relieve deep melancholy and to cure
grievous diseases ; to set free prisoners who have been unjustly imprisoned; to resist enemies and
opponents, to defend innocence and to reveal it, and to foster good fortune, well-being and peace
in a general manner.
It is sufficient for you^ to know that you are allowed, to make use of words and passages in
the Holy Scripture for your own good. The Psalms are highly recommended by some writers, as
a certain means to avoid suffering and danger, even in cases of war, fire and similar instances,
enabling us to escape unharmed, free, secure and without hindrance.
Under such happy circumstances, it is surely right and proper, that such wholesome knowledge,
which up to this day was known but to a few men, and they only the learned, was yet free to all,
although not generally known, should at least, in some degree, be brought to light.
It is obvious of course, that these printed pages will fall into unclean hands and it is neces­
sary, therefore, in order to prevent an unworthy use of them, to admonish the reader never to
use them only when necessary, as set forth in the three following paragraphs.
1. If you are willing to avail yourself of the Psalms, as shown on the following pages, you
are warned never to attempt it only in a case of extreme necessity, and when there is no other help
at hand.
2. If this be so, in experimenting, place your trust in the goodness and power of the Most
High and ever blessed God, upon whom you may perhaps have hitherto called under an unknown
holy name.
3. If you wish to console yourself with this help, you must live in such a manner that no
crime or willful sin can trouble your conscience ; for it is well known, that the prayer of the
ungodly is not acceptable to God. At the same time you must have your undertaking continually
hi your mind. And herewith you are committed to the protection of the Most High.
THE BURNING OF INCENSE
The Continuity Of Life After Death. The Burning Of Incense is an old custom which has
been followed religiously for ages. Again, the Burning Of Incense seems to stimulate the belief
in Spiritual communication. The Burning of Incense also offers an appropriate and striking way
of showing one’s faith in a continued life beyond the grave. Many burn Candles and Incense to
manifest in an outward way, the devotion and faith they have in the Spiritual World. Therefore,
the burning of Incense is mute but striking evidence of one’s faith in the continuity of life after
death.
Life Here But A Temporary Abode. There seems to be something about the Burning of
Incense which impresses upon us the great, over-powering fact that our life and intelligence con­
tinues after we have finished up our earthly career. These are great truths, all flowing from the
ages and philosophies of the past. The Burning of Incense by a Spiritualist, or a true Christian,
may be accepted as a sign of their faith in the existence of another life. Genuine Incense burned
now and then is impressive testimony ; an exhibition of faith and belief on their part that life here
is but a temporary abode that is touched by the fingers of light for a short time only; while all
around yawns an Infinite, shoreless gulf of impenetrable darkness, from one side of which we
appeared and to whose other side we shall hurry at death to meet our loved ones and friends
living in the Spiritual World.
THE BURNING OF INCENSE AN OLD CUSTOM
As stated in the beginning of this article, the Berning of Incense is an old custom which has
been followed religiously for ages, and many burn Incense for different purposes. Some believe it
an appropriate and striking way of showing their faith in a continued life beyond the grave. Others
burn Incense as a material manifestation of. their faith in the Spiritual world beyond the grave.
Candles and Incense are burned in almost every country, during Religious or Drvine meditation for
the purpose of obtaining higher spiritual uplifting and understanding.
Spiritualists and Students of esoteric subjects burn Incense while performing their professional
work during spiritual meditation as well as exercises.
Again, many of those who believe in these things, obtain Incense and burn it if they are in
trouble or wish to protect themselves against enemies, or any misfortune, believing that by carry­
ing out the old custom of burning Incense they will attract higher spiritual influences and be ^ble
to have their wishes fulfilled.
Indeed, among some classes of people, Incense is burned when they get into trouble of any
kind, whether it is financial trouble, trouble with the law, home troubles or serious sickness.
All of this of course, is quite natural in view of the fact that it is based upon an old belief
that there is something Divine and Sacred connected with the burning 01 Ineensa.

manner, the first three verses of Psalm 1 ; all the while having great and Divine faith that she

one who prays this Psalm with a desire and wish, to know the name of the robber must have
unbounded faith in the Divine power of the Lord God, beseeching that the thief may be caught or,
shown before his eyes in a vision, that the thief may be known to all men. Again, if it be desired,

can, if you wish, repeat the prayer whjch follows. ‘‘Lord and judge of all the world! Thou
boldest the hearts of all men in Thy power and movest them according to Thy holy will; grant

Psalm 24 And Psalm 25
Psalm 24 And 25.—Although the contents of these remarkable Psalms differ materially, in

Psalm For One Visiting A Strange City

Psalm 33.—If you have been unfortunate in respect to the constant death of your children
before or after birth, you may, if you so desire, burn some of de Laurence’s Mystic Rites Incense

before or after confinement. While praying this wonderful Psalm, your soul must be uplifted to
God, who is to be praised for his goodness ; for his power. All of your confidence and faith is to
be literally and intensely placed in God; ever believing that you will be more fortunate with any
child born to you thereafter; that it will live and be blessed by God, who is a giver of all good.
Psalm For One Deprived Of A Position
Psalm 41.—A peculiar characteristic of this Psalm is that it brings to those who pray it in
a sincere and faithful manner, great hope and unlimited consolation, especially if they have a
troubled heart.
If your enemies have talked about you, or did something that has been the means of your
losing a valued position so that your earnings will be thereby reduced ; or if you have been deprived
of a position and another put in your place, you can, if you wish, burn some of de Laurence’s
Oriental Incense and pray Psalm 41 three times each day immediately after getting up in the morning
and the last thing before going to bed at night. A frequent citing or praying of this Psalm will be
the means of bringing unto you the blessings of God and help you put your enemies to shame and
humiliation.
The formula for making both Oriental and Temple Incense was kept a close secret for
centuries. Today it is used throughout the Orient, Europe, North and South America, The
West Indies, and Africa, for Sacrificial Fumigation as well as an invoking Powder. Again,
the burning of Incense finds great favor with Clairvoyants and Spirit Mediums. The burn­
ing of it, so it is reported, seems to help them to obtain stronger materializations. It is also
well liked by Crystal-Gazers, Trumpet Mediums and Spiritual Healers.
For Spirit Development; for Strengthening the Memory; for rendering Concentration
easier- for acquiring Knowledge; for gaining the powers of Prophesy and Foreseeing, both
Temple and Oriental Incense has been used by Occult students and Spiritualists in all ages
of the world.
Indeed, Incense is believed, by Advanced Occult Students, to be the best article to use
while passing into a Spiritual Trance or for Prophesying. It may be used in the following
manner; Place one fourth of a teaspoonful of Incense in the Burner; after lighting it, close
the eyes, and breathe in its dreamy, soothing fragrance slowly. Let the mind dwell on any
person you have in mind, or whatever thought or subject you desire information on.
In fact, it would be impossible to tell here, the many different reasons people have all
over the world for burning Incense. Some use it for driving disagreeable odors from the
home. Others claim that it drives away evil influences; while there are still others who
believe it helps to lull the irritations of a nervous or bad tempered person whom they are
going to meet.

INCENSE IN THE ORIENT
Incense In Ancient And Modern Literature. Temple Incense is
a product of the Far East. We are told that it ia one of the oldest
articles of commerce, as indicated by the fact that the world’s first
trade routes were established for the transportation of Incense that
its importance and significance in the life of the Orient are proven by
the innumerable references to Incense in ancient and modern litera­
ture. We are informed that Temple and Oriental Incense are made
according to a formula adopted from one that for centuries has played
an important part in the Ceremonial Rites of the Orient, having been
first made by Arabian chemists.
Used Since The Beginning Of The World. Incense has been used,
in some form or other, by people of different beliefs, since the be­
ginning of the world, and, in ancient times was prepared as an Aro­
matic Substance which exhaled perfume, that is, it produced a sweet
odor when burned for Sacrificial Fumigation, or as an Invoking Pow­
der.
Incense In The Bible. Incense is referred to in the Bible*: “He
made the holy annointing oil, and the pure Incense of sweet spices,
according to the product of the Apothecary.” (Exodus XXXVII, 29.)
There are few things so characteristic of the fascination and
mystery of the beautiful lands beyond the Pacific, as Temple or
Oriental Incense. The dreamy, soothing fragrance of Burning In­
cense brings to mind the rosy dawns, the brilliant sunlight, the purple dusks of the Orient—the
enchantments of strange, Far Eastern countries—the subtle, languorous sweetness of tropical gar­
dens and of blossom-laden breezes blown from palm-fringed islands set in turquoise seas. All In­
cense from the Far East, is made according to a formula adopted from one that for centuries has
played an,important part in the Ceremonial, Spiritual and Occult Rites of the Orient. Its principal
ingredients, Sandalwood and Patachouly, were among the first to be used by those learned Arabian
chemists, to whom the world is indebted for its finest Oriental Perfumes.
The Magic Use Of Incense
Modern materialism seems to have lost sight completely of the Occult or Esoteric teachings
of the ancients. There are many hidden treasures of the past, and these consist of a knowledge
of those Occult and Spiritual forces of the universe.
Go back as far as one likes, even to pre-historic ages, and we find nearly every nation of
antiquity using Incense or Oriental Perfumes, and, not always for ornate and sentimental purposes.
The fact is, the finer forces possessed by man seem to be affected by Oriental Perfumes and In­
cense. Take the case of modern anesthetics. Note the helplessness which follows the inhaling
of chloroform or ether.
In all ages of the world Incense or Candles have been burned before any Occult or Spiritual
work has been started. The Orientals, especially the Hindus and Japanese, always burn Incense
or Candles when about to invoke or call the Spirits.
Among the Ancient Egyptians and Hindus, the composition of Incense and Oriental Perfumes
was kept a profound secret and only made known to Initiates and those fitted to receive the higher
Occult and Spiritual knowledge of the Adepts and Old Masters.
Primarily, the mind should be prepared before Candles are burned or Oriental Incense Magi­
cally used. That is, Incense should not be burned in the ordinary way. Affirmations should pre­
cede the use of Incense or Candles; a statement of what one wants, and a strong desire to obtain
it, must possess, the aspirant.
In fact, it was held by the Ancients that no Magical, or Spiritual practices were of any use
unless the mind could be brought to a reverential attitude ; an attitude desirous to learn, to develop,
only the Highest and Divinest Occult and Spiritual Powers. Nor is this all; there must be no thoughts
of anger, envy, criticism, no unkindly acts, or evil Inclinations toward others or it. will render the
Incense useless for Invoking and attracting higher Spiritual and Occult Powers.
There ’is about Virtue, or Goodness, an actual definite rate of pure vibration created, and this
rate harmonizes with the Perfume or Oriental Incense used. We know that in music certain notes
are in harmony with others, and that other notes when struck together produce discord. In the
world of effects, when discord takes' place, it is like two people pulling in opposite directions with
equal force—nothing happens only that a good deal of force has been wasted to no purpose. Incense
and Oriental Perfumes only act where the finer forces on which they act are in a quiet, harmonious
condition of true faith and belief. This particularly applies where we wish to raise our Occult
and Spiritual Powers to a higher level, where we want to make ourselves receptive to higher
Astral Influences, and come in touch directly with the Great Hidden Forces of the universe. Our
Inner Vision or Spiritual Sight, then becomes clearer ; we can see into problems which before we
were in doubt about, and were constantly in the habit of consulting others. We become more self-
reliant ; we are able to entertain bigger plans, to see ways and means of carrying projects through;
we become independent of outside help ; we solve our own difficulties ; our ambition becomes firmer,
more noble, and we no longer lead the mean petty lives we have been leading before. We refuse to
be mere average persons, but see^that life is something far greater than we used to believe it was.
Many have heard of people being unpleasantly affected by certain houses when they have entered
them. They have not liked them, though they could give no definite reason for their dislike. The
Tower of London and the mummy rooms of the British Museum have had effects on sensitive per­
sons, and it was not on account of their imagination. The fact is, both these places have a moral
“atmosphere” which the student of Occultism recognizes as being due to apparitions and allied
phenomena. If the person is keyed up to the same rate as the rooms or place vibrates,
then, he or she, feels the vibrations repeated in his or her body. Experiments have been re­
peatedly carried out showing that this is no idle statement. Many have seen it in cases where the
person so affected has been ignorant of the history associated with the place complained of.
To aid in securing desirable conditions as far as your home or room is concerned, one should
first burn Incense in it, as this helps to drive away all adverse influences. An old room or house may
be filled by the emanations and evil forces of all its former inhabitants, and in Meditation or Clair­
voyance, these bad forces will make it difficult to get clear, definite results. At one end of the
room—preferably the east—a little table should be used as an altar for the burning of your Incense
No stranger or one not in sympathy with your work should have access to the room. You desire
to impregnate it with your own Magnetism alone, as Cross-Magnetism would befog results to say
the least. Have the room well ventilated in fair weather, so that the fresh air may enter. There
must be nothing stuffy about it, and window shades or heavy, dark draperies are the best,

Further, when you enter this Sacred room, it must be with a mind at rest, with no troubles
of any kind. Worries, petty jealousies, anger, strife, low, coarse, sensual thoughts and doubt of self
must be left on the threshold. This, of course, cannot be done very easily without previous prepara­
tion, hence the need to practice Thought Control, as taught in that wonderful book, namely, “The
Master Key,” published and sold only by The de Laurence Company. i
You are going to create an atmosphere for yourself; you want a room to which you can retire
when mentally tired, dispirited, a little out of tune with the Higher Spiritual Forces. Do not mis­
understand, however. You must not carry these negative conditions into your Sacred Sanctuary,
but that whenever, in the outer world you may be discouraged or not perfectly happy, you must lay
your cares, doubts and misgivings aside, and say to yourself: “I will enter my Sacred room and
put myself into touch with the great Hidden Spiritual Forces of Nature, whence all Power, all Life,
all Mental Force is derived.” So that when your soul lacks anything; when it is depleted ot
energy, or when your mind has been harassed with home or business worries, you will find solace
and sure recuperation in that Sacred Room wherein you have burned your soothing Incense and
thereby made for yourself a place for soul rest.
Thus, by entering your Sanctuary or Sacred Room with feelings of Gladness, of Hopefulness, of
Potency, High-Souled Ambition, Aspiration and feelings which raise one to the highest point you can
conceive, you actually attract and draw to yourself very wonderful forces. They remain in the
room, are strengthened each time you enter the room in such a hopeful mental state, and by means
of the Incense burned therein ; begin to weave about you Soul and Occult Powers and possibilities,
which only the future can outline.
Now, if you treat what is' written here the same way you do a novel or cheap literature and
books written by surface writers, you will derive no benefit from what is given forth. This contri­
bution to the Magical and Spiritual use of Incense gives Force of Character ; builds up your Inner
Forces, affects your surroundings with certainty, provided the Spirit and Faith inculcated herein
is entered into. But only by actual practice and the Burning of Incense, can these Grand Powers
be gained. Mere reading of cheap books that teach nothing, will do little beyond stimulating your
curiosity, or pass away an hour. There is in the study of True Occultism, as contained in “The
Great Book Of Magical Art, Hindu Magic, And East Indian Occultism.” by de Laurence, Spiritual
work enough to last one many years ; but you must first find the Key by following the instructions
laid down in those books written by the old Adepts and Masters.
It has been said that man is more than a mere physical body; he is more than a material
envelope ; but his body is thin, and within that outer casing lies another; the exact duplicate of his
outer personality. It is formed of a very fine spiritual matter, so fine, in fact, that it is scarcely
entitled to the name of matter ; but nevertheless it is matter after all; but too fine to be perceived
by the eyesight and is known as the Astral or Spiritual body. Anyone gifted with even a slight
degree of Clairvoyance, or Inner Sight, can perceive it, and it is this duplicate which is often seen
and taken for a ghost. The Astral* Body is the receptacle of the emotions, and all our feelings
may be referred to it. It is powerfully affected by certain Perfumes and Unseen Forces, and as
our feelings are affected so we act.
Many people are, as a matter of fact, moved by their inner feelings more than they are by their
thoughts, or by reason or common sense. The English and American people are less moved than,
say, the French or the Italians ; they are reputed to be cold, phlegmatic, yet, all the same these
feelings play a tremendous part in their ordinary daily lives. Being ruled by one’s feelings is being
ruled by the passions, and seeing how prone the majority are to get into a passion with the slightest
pretext, one can understand how Oriental Perfumes and Incense will act on this subtle spiritual
body.
Seeing that the use of Incense is now being so widely used by many Occult Students, Spiritualists
and Healers ; it may be well to let the reader know more about it in performing all Occult Oper­
ations. Certain Herbs and Dried Plants when burnt emit odors which have a calming effect. These
are found useful in preparing the mind; others literally intoxicate and produce illusions when in­
haled, the fumes being charged with substances which have a peculiar affinity with the secret
“Gates of the Astral Body,” as they are termed in the East, by the Chakras. These seven Cen­
ters of the body vibrate at a more rapid rate when these fumes impinge upon them, and this
quickly rushes through the whole body.
In this state, then, the thoughts are influenced by the feelings and the Clairvoyant state is
reached much more quickly. Moreover, the reaction on the thoughts leads to the inception of new
ideas, and when a man gets new ideas he usually does something with them if he has any ambition
at all worth mentioning. High-grade Oriental Perfumes and Incense influence the Thought-centers
of the body, so it is believed.
A further reason is afforded in the well known law of Sympathies and Antipathies, as taught
in “The Great Book Of Magical Art, Hindu Magic And East Indian Occultism,” upon which medical
science is based to some extent. Some schools of Materia Medica work with the Sympathies and
others with the Antipathies. Much in the same way we see that opposite temperaments in persons
get on beter than when both are alike ; they are complementary. It is another example of the
“pairs of opposites,” such a Light and Darkness, Heat and Cold, Day and Night, Magnet and
Electric, Positive and Negative. The reciprocal action engendered between two oposite tempera­
ments, leads one to give up that which the other has not, and the interchange is beneficial to both.
Supposing you have got your Sacred Room properly prepared, a little Incense may be burned;
no plants, dog or cat, being in the room at the time. The doors should be closed, but the windows
may be opened a little. Left thus for twenty-four hours, the room should then be well aired and
is ready for use. If hangings, shades or curtains are used at all, let them be dark or deep blue.
First procure from The de Laurence Co., a packet of their Oriental or Temple Incense, to­
gether with a durable Incense burner. Place within the burner some Incense and set fire to it.
It will burn for a long time.
Ordinary clothing may be worn. To get the best results for the Higher Occult and Magical Pur­
poses, Incense obtained from this firm may be used exclusive of all other brands. Always, after
lighting your Incense, place the top on the burner, as this insures that it shall not die out before be­
ing burnt through.

♦As long as anyone fancies his highest ideal to exist outside of him, somewhere above the clouds or in the history
of the past, he will go outside of himself to seek for it in his fancy or in the pages of history. This is not true
wisdom, but merely a dreaming about it; for not that wisdom which exists outside of man, but that which has taken
root in him renders him wise. A child is not born from outside of its mother’s womb, but from within, and the
spiritual regeneration of man must be accomplished by that which is existing in him.
The spiritual regeneration of man requires the opening of his inner senses, and this again involves the development
of the internal organs or the spiritual body, while the latter is intimately connected with the physical form. Thus
this regeneration is not an entirely spiritual process, but productive of great changes in the physical body. He who
rejects, neglects, or despises his physical body as long as he has not outgrown the necessity of having such a corporeal
form, may be compared to the yolk of an egg wanting to be free from the white of the egg and the shell, without
t iving grown into a bird.

TEMPLE INCENSE WITH DAILY RECITALS
Taking the days of the week, you may, if you so desire, burn Temple Incense while reciting
different Psalms.
SUNDAY—If it is your heart’s wish and great d^ire to be successful in all of your under­
takings, you may, if you wish, on Sunday, burn Temple Incense for ten minutes and repeat in a low,
firm voice, Psalm 55. If you wish to overcome the evil set against you by your enemies, so that it
will be turned to naught; or you desire some particular wish granted, you may, if you wish, repeat
Psalm 55 seven times while burning Temple Incense. There is no doubt you will find this day and
Psalm good.
MONDAY—If it is your wish to receive knowledge through a Dream or in a vision, you may,
if you so desire, purify yourself by fasting twenty-four hours and burn Temple Incense while re­
peating Psalm 23 seven times. This can be done between the hours of eleven and twelve o’clock at
night.
Temple Incense can be burned of course on any day of the week ; although it is believed by
some that Sunday and Wednesday between the hours of eleven and twelve at night is a very good
time. Being a moon-scent Incense, it might well be dedicated to the lunar goddess.
NOTE—If upon consideration, it becomes your wish, you may repeat the following prayer after
you have read Psalm 23 between the hours of eleven and twelve on Monday night, as indicated above.
The prayer follows: Oh, Great and Powerful spirit of the world (Godf), notwithstanding Thy
unutterable mighty, hidden power, exaltation and glory, Thou wilt lend a listening ear to the prayer
of Thy humblest and faithful disciple and wilt fulfill his desires. Hear my earnest prayer, Thou
Great Universal Spirit, and let it be pleasing to Thy Holy will to reveal unto me in a dream, whether
(here the affair of which a correct knowledge is desired must be plainly stated) as Thou did’st often
reveal through dreams the fate of our forefathers. Grant me my petition for the sake of Thy
adorable name. Repeat this prayer from memory four times, burning Incense all the time.
TUESDAY-—Temple Incense is an appropriate fumigation to burn on this day. If you are
troubled by your enemies—open or secret—you may if you wish, repeat Psalm 53, while burning
Temple Incense between the hours of eleven and twelve at night, if possible. If you wish to feel
doubly secure from their malice and to- overcome them, you may if you wish, repeat Psalm 64, as
indicated above.
WEDNESDAY—An appropriate fumigation for this day is de Laurence’s Mystic Rites Incense.
If you are about to enter college; or have a case in court; or hold converse with influential
men; or if you wish to gain wisdom and superior or spiritual powers, you may if you wish, repeat
Psalm 134 five times while the Incense is burning.
THURSDAY—If any man wishes to procure the love of women; or if it is wished to make
peace between man and wife, and especially influence a cross or unreasonable wife, a man can if
he so desires, repeat the 45th Psalm ten times while burning de Laurence’s Oriental Incense.
Further, if any man’s wife has departed and he wishes her to return, he can if he so wishes, repeat
this very same Psalm while burning de Laurence’s Oriental Incense.
FRIDAY'—This day is held to be unlucky by those who are superstitious, weak, and disin­
clined to develop an aggressive disposition. However, if any person wishes to increase in good for­
tune, might and power ; or to gain the love, respect, friendship, and good will of another, he can if
he so wishes, repeat the 137th Psalm nine consecutive times while burning de Laurence’s Mystic
Rites Incense.
SATURDAY—If any person is troubled with a guilty conscience or an evil spirit and wishes to
obtain relief, he can if he so wishes, recite the 90th Psalm four times while burning de Laurence’s
Mystic Rites Incense.
f God is the greatest power in the universe, because He is the source and sum of all powers in their highest mode
of manifestation. God is therefor© absolute consciousness, absolute love, and absolute wisdom. If we wish to accomplish
anything great, the first requirement is the presence of God, because He is man’s understanding and power, and resides
in man. But God cannot be approached by an intellect that is without love. God is love, and is only attracted by love.
We cannot know the principle of love, unless we love it with our heart, and the more we desire it, the more will we
be able to comprehend with the heart what the principle is. The love of God is therefore a power transcending the
lower nature of man; it cannot develop itself out of the animal elements of man, but it is a gift from the universal
fountain of love, in the same sense as sunshine cannot grow out of the earth, but comes from above. God lives in the
hearts of men, and if we desire to love him, we must love all that is good in humanity. The love of humanity is the
beginning of the knowledge of God. The intellect is the greatest possession of mortal man, and an intellect that rises
to the source of all knowledge by the power of love may know God and all the mysteries of Nature, and become
godlike itself; but an intellect without love leads into error, grovels in darkness, and goes to perdition. An intellec
combined with love for the supreme good leads to wisdom; an intellect without love leads to the powers of evil.

MYSTICAL CEREMONIAL COMPOUND
ORIENTAL INCENSE is one of those enchantingly exquisite suftumes, whose odor is most
pleasing. Throughout the Orient it Is believed the burning of Incense helps one in the generation of
Occult. Spiritual and Esoteric Powers. At all times, and in all places, Oriental Incense gives forth
a Subtle, Fragrant odor, stronger and more agreeable than any other Incense or Invoking Powder.
This sweet-smelling Mystical Ceremonial Compound may be used exclusively by sincere and earnest
investigators. Those who wish to be lulled into a “Soul-Vision” or Clairvoyant state, where they
can experiment in those wierd “out-of-the-body” sensations, so much loved by the Oriental,
certainly could do no better than try a package of Temple or Oriental Incense ; especially if they
are using a Magic Mirror or Crystal, er sitting for development.
The Incense sold by The de Laurence Co. is made after the same formulas that the Old
Masters used, ages and ages ago. Therefore, it is an Aromatic Compound which really and truly
diffuses an agreeable, dreamy fragrance, most pleasing to the senses, and is used by many who
believe it helpful In the development of Clairvoyance and Spirit-Sight.
Incense is used abroad, in Courts and Palaces of high-'’"ste titled Oriental people, also
bv the Priests in the Lamarsaries and Hindu Occult Chambers. One package should do for one
hundred or more sittings, so you see it is very inexpensive, costing only two cents or less per sitting.
Temple Incense is highly recommended for use among Spiritualists, those holding Circle, Public
Mediums and those who do a professional business.
(Continued on next page)
Both Temple and Oriental Incense have for centuries been used in all high-grade
Invocations, Ceremonial, Magical and Occult Rites of the Orient and the Far East. Its
ingredients were among the first Secret Preparations to be used by those learned Arabian
chemists to whom the world is deeply indebted for Oriental Perfumes aVd Incense.
Little need be said here about Oriental Perfumes and fumigations made from Incense,
as all who believe in Eastern Occultism and spiritism, know that Incense is burned during
all of the various operations and communications with the unseen world throughout the
Orient and the Far East.
Hundreds and thousands of years ago, the Ancient Masters knew much regarding the
Occult use's of Temple Incense, Ceremonial Incense, Black Incense, and other subtle Ori­
ental Compounds. It is reported that they well knew why they were so efficacious.
These Ancients also well knew the power and meaning of Confections, Lights, Lamps,
Infernal Imprecations, and also of Seals, Charms and Talismans traced on Parchment
Paper, or engraved on Solid Gold. It is to be regretted that there are very, very few
indeed, today, who have made a sincere study of the deeper phases of Oriental Occultism
and Spiritism, so. that they could get a proper interpretation of the deeper and powerful
work.
The reason why many never learn Occultism or advance in Development and Spirit-
Sight is obvious. They insist on buying every cheap, new little publication issued. Every
so-called New Thought gun fired by some crank professor attracts them. They will insist
upon following so-called modern authors, teachers, cheap professors, and fake institutes
of which there is a multitude today, instead of confining themselves to some of the works
of the Old World writers, such as Agrippa, author of THE PHILOSOPHY OF NATURAL
MAGIC, (Order Ko, 23. Price ¥3.50; Foreign 16s.) Eliphas Levi, author of THE MYSTE­
RIES OF MAGIC (Order No. 11. Price $4.00; Foreign £1.) Also TRANSCENDENTAL
MAGIC, ITS DOCTRINE AND RITUAL, (Order No. 9. Price $5.00; Foreign £1 Gs).
Yes, all students and investigators should be careful how they send for books written
by surface writers. Stick to the old world authors and masters such as Paracelsus, Agrippa,
Levi, Franz Hartmann, and de Laurence.
Those who have ordered and studied such works as, “The Book Of Death, Hindu
Spiritism, Soul Transition, And Soul Reincarnation,” known as the Handbook of Spiritu­
alism, by de Laurence, (Order No. 26. Price $2.00; Foreign 9s.), also “The Great Book Of
Magical Art, Hindu Magic And East India Occultism.” (Order No. 2. Price $10.75; Foreign
£2 IBs.), always get the best of results. Indeed it is tradition that those who have studied
de Laurence’s books have advanced from the very start.
Don’t think you can ever become a Master unless you study under a Master. Some
people think they can develop simply by reading some Spiritual novel written by some
fly-by-the-gate author, who has had a fairy dream and put. it in book form. Let cheap
books, cheap professors, cheap institutes and cheap mail courses severely alone. Pay a
fair, honest price and deal with those who handle Official Publications written by authors
of reputation, and you will have less cause to complain about your advancement.
The same thing holds good regarding Incense and all Oriental Compounds used by the
student of Occultism to bring about Development, “Spirit-Sight” "Soul-Vision,’ and such
“Out-of-the-body” experiences as Propelling the Astral Form, etc. Insist upon getting
the best Temple, or Ceremonial Incense and feel certain beyond a reasonable doubt that
you are getting the genuine article. Unless you do this you will be disappointed, as you
should be; for it’s clearly your own fault if you buy of unreliable dealers or purchase
unknown and untried goods.
It’s claimed that the Eastern Masters once held the secret of making Incense which
many today use to help them find the Key which unlocks the Mysteries of Spirit Life,
so that they may acquire the Gift of Clairvoyance and Soul Vision.
For the benefit of those interested, and who wish to test Incense, for Conjuration and
Ceremonies, we will state that it is used as follows:
FIRST. It may be used in an Incense Burner which can be obtained from this firm.
Use about one-quarter of a teaspoonful at a “Sitting.” Put the Incense in the Burner,
light it with a match by allowing the flame to die out. Then allow the Incense to
smoulder. Place the Burner upon a table or stand. Next seat yourself about two feet
away and gaze into and look through the ascending spirals of smoke which arise from
the fumigation.
Use a darkened room, or, if you have a light, it must be very subdued; keep the mind
perfectly passive, as directed by de Laurence in his Lessons in “The Mystic Test Book Of
The Hindu Occult Chambers.”
While the Incense is burning entertain a reverent spirit of mind and soul. Observe
that conditions conform strictly to directions given here, and in the book just referred
to, as they are very essential. Again, always keep the package of Incense securely closed
and open it only when you wish to use some. We print below a testimonial taken from
an English Publication. This testimonial seems to have been given by a good soul who
had used Incense to produce a fumigation.
TESTIMONIAL
"I hasten to send you a description of the remarkable phenomena produced by the
mystical Hindu Powder or "Soul-Vision” inducing subtle compound called Temple Incense
which I have been using in an Incense Burner to make a fumigation while sitting for
development of my Higher Spiritual and Divine Powers. The first vision was that of a
Hindu, as real as if materialized and of advanced spirituality. After this glorious phe­
nomena had passed, there appeared a radiant Spiritual being robed in pale blue, studded
over with glittering stars and Astral lights.
"This Celestial remained many minutes. Thus ended my first sitting, at least I had
thought it ended; but no; for throughout the night following the sitting, I was travelling
consciously upon the Spirit Plane and conversing with spirit friends and brothers of the
Mystic organization of the unseen world.”
* « * * «
It is said by those, who profess to know, that many ages ago, even prior to the erec­
tion of King Solomon’s Temple, that the subtle and Invoking Powers of sweet and fra­
grant Incense, Powders and Rare, Costly Essences were largely used and known.
It is true, as all who have visited the Orient will attest, that Incense in some form
or another, is burned on all occasions where Invocation, Astral or “Spirit-Sight” are
desired or required. Again, Candles or Incense are used by some operators while intro­
ducing the Hypnotic State.
Many burn Incense before going to meet a person with an unkind disposition believ­
ing that it will help to lull the irritation of a nervous or bad tempered person. If you
wish to be successful in business, or whenever you have an important appointment to
keep, or Interview someone from whom you wish to secure a favor you might try the
burning of Incense. Many are today using it for this selfsame purpose.
If you wish to try to lull yourself into a "soul-vision” Inducing state so much loved
by the Oriental, you certainly could do no better than try a package of Incense, especially
if you are using a Magic Mirror or Crystal.
Both Oriental and Temple Incense has been for Centuries used extensively throughout
the Far East by those who believe that when burning its soothing and dreamy fragrance
helps to drive away evil influences. Again, as stated elsewhere, Incense is burned as an
Invoking Powder throughout the Orient, by those who believe it helps them in Spiritual
Development as well as attracting Spirits.

TEMPLE INCENSE IS A PRODUCT OF THE ORIENT
wt
Burning An Invoking Powder.
Incense In Ancient
And Modern Liter­
ature. Temple Incense is a product of
the Far. East. It consists of a fine
Golden-Brown Powder: the kind that
is always used in the Orient. We are
told that it is one of the oldest articles
of commerce, as indicated by the fact
that the world’s first trade routes
■ were established for the transporta­
tion of Salt and Incense; that its
importance and significance in the life
of the Orient are proven by the in­
numerable references to Incense in
ancient and modern literature. The importers inform us that Temple In­
cense is made according to a formula adopted from one that for centuries
has played an important part in the Ceremonial Rites of the Orient, having
been first made by Arabian chemists.
Used Since The Beginning Of The World. Incense has been
used, in some form or other, by people of different beliefs, since
the beginning of the world, and, in ancient times was prepared as
an aromatic substance which exhaled perfume during combus­
tion; being a mixture of gum spices, etc., to produce a sweet odor
when burned; an odorous resin used for Sacrificial Fumigation, such as
frankincense; olibanum; so the Standard Dictionary states.
Incense In The Bible. Incense is referred to in the Bible: “He made the
holy anointing oil, and the pure Incense of sweet spices, according to the
product of the Apothecary.” (Exodus XXXVII, 29.)
Importers Of Temple Incense. The import­
ers of Temple Incense make the following
statement regarding it: “There are few
things so characteristic of the fascination and
mystery of the beauty loving lands beyond the
Pacific, as Temple Incense. Its dreamy, sooth­
ing fragrance brings to mind the rosy dawns,
the brilliant sunlight, the purple dusks of the Orient
—the enchantments of strange, Far Eastern countries
—the subtle, languorous sweetness of tropical gar­
dens and of blossom-laden breezes blown from palm-
fringed islands set in turquoise seas. Temple Incense Oriental Incense
is made according to a formula adopted from one that for centuries has
played an important part in the Ceremonial Rites of the Orient. Its prin­
cipal ingredients, Sandalwood and Patachouly, were among the first to be
used by those learned Arabian chemists, to whom the world is indebted
for its finest perfumes. A very fine Golden-Brown Powder is the form
in which Incense has always been used in the Orient and the Far East.

Try Burning Some Incense. If you do, no doubt you will be well pleased especially "if
you are taking any exercises for the development cf your Higher Spiritual Powers. To the
Hindu the burning of Incense seems to lull him into a Soul-vision inducing state where
he experiences that weird “out-of-the body” sensation so much loved by the Oriental.
The Incense scld by this firm is made after the same aromatic compound and essential
production used ages and ages ago. It really and truly diffuses an agreeable, dreamy,
Oriental fragrance. Incense is used abroad, in Courts and Palaces of High-caste titled
Oriental people, also by the high grade Adepts of the Orient, also in the Lamarsaries and
Hindu Occult Chambers both in India and Africa. One package should do for a hundred
cr more sittings, so you see it is very inexpensive to use, costing only about 2 cents per
sitting to use the finest incense made.
Burned On All Occasions. It is said, by those who profess to know, that many ages
ago. even prior to the erection of King Solomcn’s Temple, that the Subtle and Invoking
Powers of Sweet and Fragrant Incense, and rare costly essence was largely used and
known. It is true, as all who have visited the Orient will attest, that Incense in one form
cr another is used and burned on all occasions where Spiritual Invocations are desired or

Oriental Incense
PRIVATE BRAND. SLOW BURNING
Very Highest Quality
Oriental Compound Incense In Finest Powdered Form
Genuine Oriental Incense. The Same Incense is used in Invocations, and Occult Rites
of the Orient. When burned it diffuses an Exquisite Dreamy Fragrance. This Incense,
because of its Subtle, Sweet' and Fragrant Oriental Odor is used almost exclusively by
Crystal Gazers, Occult Students, Spiritualists, Mediums and those who give Readings.
Incense In The Orient. In the Occult, Spiritual and Magical Rituals of the Orient and
the Far East, Incense is used about as follows: It is usually burned in an Incense Burner
of good ventilation. About one-fcurth of a teaspoonful is put in a Burner and a lighted
match is applied until the Incense begins to slowly burn and smoulder. Good Incense
always burns steady and slowly. The Oriental places his Incense Burner on a low stool
or the floor; seats himself about two feet away, gazes into and looks through the ascend­
ing spirals of smoke which arise frtrn the fumigation made by his burning Incense.
For Burning Incense here the Burner may be placed on a table or a stand and the user
may sit in a chair about two feet away. Use a darkened room, or if you have a light,
it should be very subdued. The mind should be kept passive, entertaining all the while
a reverent spirit within your soul. Printed below is a statement which was taken from
a London Publication:
TESTIMONIAL. “I hasten to send you a description of the remarkable phenomena pro­
duced by burning a Compound called Incense which I have been using in an Incense
Burner to make a fumigation while sitting for Soul Development and the gaining of
higher Spiritual Powers. The first vision I had was that of a Hindu as real as if mate­
rialized and of advanced spirituality. After this glorious phenomenon had passed, there
appeared in a Second Vision a radiant being robed in pale blue. This ended my first
sitting, at least I thought it had ended, but no, for throughout the night following the
sitting I seemed to be conversing with spirit friends who had passed to the Unseen World
beyond.”

tUrllM111111 LIjIi J.L Mil 11113 1 Mdl it was probably brought to the attention of the
great Mediterranean cities by traders who obtained it from natives of East Africa. These latter
gathered the gums and resins of various burseracious trees, and it is from this source that
Frankincense is obtained to the present day.
___________ We read of Frankincense in Egypt and on Mount Sinai. It graced altars of the most primitive ’
and bizarre sects — and of the most sophisticated and popular, burning in a slab of rock in
the desert and on the jeweled altars of the Temple. In a way it is a sacrifice and again it is
a supplication to the great, invisible Power on high. From earliest times down to the present,
one can trace its use in Occultism, and the modern day Occulist has ample authority for
including it in his Circle.

ore, possessing polarity. That is, they are magnetized, having positive and negative
poles, like the compass used by navigators. It is said the Jjodestone takes its name
from the fact that elongated pieces of magnetite were used in ancient times before
the invention of the compass.
Amazing Experiments
A genuine lodestone is a natural magnet and it is possible to perform many as­
tonishing experiments with it. Many consider its properties very powerful and im­

Spirit Circles And Occult Operations
THE SPIRIT CANDLE
It will be noticed that the "materialized hand,” appear­
ing in the above illustration, holds between its fingers a
candle which is burning at both ends. This wonderful
spirit picture has an inner or allegorical meaning. The
interpretation is this: As a candle can burn at both ends
at one time, so life exists both in the spirit and the mate­
rial worlds.
There are many who have used our waxen invocation
candles, and claim that they have had wonderfully good
success in Spirit Circles and all Occult operations while
burning them and that they have been able to get very
good results whenever these candles are used.
All candles sold by this firm are said to have given
very good satisfaction, and the fact that they are used
by many of the leading students in Occultism and Spirit­
ualism, as well as those who practice Magic, Black and
White, proves that they are very valuable. For Wa.ren

HYPNOTIC BRAND INVOCATION CANDLES
The Hindu Hypnotist is simply a Soul who by
being faithful has succeeded in gaining, because
he uses a special Kind of Hypnotic Brand Invo-
vation Candle, strong spirits as his friends. He
knows only too well what they can do when in­
voked with Waxen Candles or Ancient Temple
Incense. He knows only too well, the terrible
meaning of the words Hypnotism and Spiritism.
He knows again that his Spirit friends will work
for him and help him in his Occult and Hypnotic
feats. Consequently, he becomes both wise and
faithful, talks little and thinks much. He is more
often found in quiet contemplation, or communi­
cation with Spirit friends and advisers than he is
with those around him on the Earth Plane. If you
care to increase your Hypnotic (Spirit) Powers
and influence another, procure unto yourself some
Special Waxen candles (for no Occult work can
be done without Fire), and for a short space of
time, before you are ready to Hypnotize anybody
go to a room where you will be alone and light four of the candles and let them burn, sit
quietly with your eyes closed and withhold your mind as much as possible from every­
thing about you. The essential difference between the American and East Indian Hyp­
notist is this: Before the western operator attempts to Hypnotize, he is generally found
telling his friends what a great Hypnotist he has become. Before the Hindu attempts
any hypnotic feats he is always found in seclusion, quietly burning his Waxen Candles
or Ancient Temple Incense to conjure spirits to help him.

NOTICE. In every age of the world Candles have been burned. It is an old belief that
goes back into the ages sc far that it is lost in the *iight of time. It seems that there is
something about the burning of Candles that helps one to operate and manifest Super­
human, Spiritual and Occult Powers. Therefore, Candles are burned. The usual method
is to burn TWO CANDLES for the space of about one hour. Many people, while BURNING
Candles for some particular purpose, either sit or lie down and CONCENTRATE THEIR
MIND INTENSELY ON THE THING THEY WISH BROUGHT ABOUT, whether it is Heal­
ing, Invocation of Spirits and Clairvoyant Powers, or Protection against Black Magic, and
Evil Spirits,

Therefore, the burning of candles is mute but striking evidence of one’s faith in the conti­
nuity of life after death.
THE BURNING OF WAXEN CANDLES
The Continuity Of Life After Death. The Burning- Of Candles is an old cus­
tom which has been followed religiously for ages. Again, the Burning Of Can­
dles and Incense seems to stimulate the belief in Spiritual communication. The
Burning of Candle also offers an appropriate and striking way of showing one’s
faith in a continued life beyond the grave. Many burn candles to manifest in
an cutward way, the devotion and faith they have in the Spiritual World.
Jft ViT Life Here But A Temporary Abode. There seems to be something about the
(L^sL. Burning Of A Candle which impresses upon us the great, over-pewering fact
'WEs that our life and intelligence continues after we have finished up our earthly
career. These are great truths, all flowing from the ages and philosophies of
the past. The Burning of Candles by a Spiritualist, or an Occultist, may be
accepted as a sign of their faith in the existence of another life. A Candle
burned now and then is impressive testimony; an exhibition of faith and belief on their
part that life here is but a temporary abode that is touched by the fingers of light for a
short time only; while all around yawns an infinite, shoreless gulf of impenetrable dark­
ness, from one side of which we appeared and to whose other side we shall hurry at death
to meet our loved ones and friends living in the Spiritual World.

THE ETERNAL PRINCIPLE
By de LAURENCE
The struggle between light and darkness, between good and evil, is as old as the world,
and yet there is nc- principle of evil; whatever degrades is evil, whatever elevates is good.
Evil or so-called sin is simply undeveloped good. Good and evil are the light and shadow
of the one eternal principle of life, and each is necessary for the existence of the ether.
The struggle between light and shadow is life, and there can be no life without a
struggle.
Matter transmits force, but does not originate force. It is fcr a time the receptacle of
power, but not the power. AH essence of power belongs to Spirit. All pure force is in­
visible.
Matter and Spirit may be one to the Absolute and Inflnite Being, but that one is Spirit.
In human speech, matter is only the name of an effect whose cause is wrapped in Mystery.
It remains for the human to penetrate the veil and solve the mystery. And the solu­
tion of this problem of mind and matter discovers man unto himself, and binds him in
loving union forever with the Infinite “I am,” the Spirit of all.
Absence of feeling and of suffering only shows that the process of death has begun, or
that the animal has taken full possession. Pain is not an element to be most dreaded; for,
as gold is refined by fire, the Soul is refined by pain, and only through the death of suffering
does the human Soul rise into eternal life.
If selfishness and the animal instinct have full sway, the Soul shrivels toward decay,
while all its noble powers are congealed, its sensibilities benumbed, its vision blinded, its
intellect dimmed, and from the once clear mirror the reflecton of a noble Soul shines no
more where the innermost temple might have been radiant with truth and virtue.
DEATH—Is death more tc be feared because it is an enigma the mysteries of which
western dull minds, because obscured by theology, cannot fathom, or thefr weak fancy
cannot comprehend?
The human Soul is the anchorage or place of ideas. The Astral body cr star magno is
the mirror that reflects and records them, human thoughts being simply the clothing ot
these ideas. The spirit is the self-acting energy that produces the Idea.

TWELVE PERFUMES FOR THE DEEULTIST
The Doctrine of the Masters includes, it is said, extensive expositions on the use of
perfumes by the Occultist, as if, in their opinion, the odors—invisible to our eyes—
formed a symbolic union between Reality and the Preternatural. The uses suggested are
manifold, apparently, having been developed in the course of hundreds of years by
energetic Workers in the Mystic. For -instance, they were held important in evocatory
operations, in human relations, and in material affairs of this world—insofar as these
were believed to be-affected by Occult Manipulation.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING PERFUME WITH EACH BOTTLE
You will find these perfumes to your liking in every way: they are characterized by long-clinging odor
and wide-ranging penetration, qualities that make them suitable for Sprinklings and Suffumigations. It is
conceivable, that in their use, their aromas may stir within the mind and memory recollections of loves,
hates, and fears long past and dimly remembered—ghosts of powers dimly perceived.
IMPORTED "JEWELED" APPLICATOR CAPS AND BOTTLES
FURNISHED—WHILE OUR STOCK LASTS
1‘or a limited time (dependent entirely on sales) we shall be able to supply the beautiful "jeweled”
applicator caps, and the "crown ’ and frosted glass bottles pictured. As this announcement goes to press,
we have on hand just 2592 of the caps and 2736 of the bottles—all genuine importations from Europe.
When this stock is exhausted, it cannot be replenished, but we will continue to furnish "TALISMAN”
brand perfumes, if our customers desire them, in the most suitable substitute containers available.
CARRY "TALISMAN" BRAND PERFUME BOTTLES ON THE PERSON
The smaller bottle pictured—one dram size—is particularly suitable for carrying on the person: women
will find it convenient in their handbags and purses; men can slip it into their vest pockets inconspicuously
and privately. Both the one-dram "Crown” style bottle, and the half-ounce Frosted bottle are beautiful
examples of perfume bottle manufacture. The jeweled” caps are equipped with glass applicator rods
which are most convenient to use to apply the perfumes to the person, or to "Sprinkle” a room, bed, book,
etc., or Ip "dress” or "magnetize” candles and equipment—understood to be practices in the Occult.

VALE OF KASHMAR
Used In Eastern Orders Of Sacred Mysteries
EXQUISITE ORIENTAL PERFUME
We desire to draw the attention of the one who reads here to our VALE OF KASH­
MAR, that wonderful Oriental Perfume. This Exquisite Perfume is packed in original
Oriental boxes. Each bottle is sealed with ground glass stoppers which are made to fit
so that the fragrant Oriental odor cannot escape; neither can there be any undue evapora­
tion from these special bottles.
Oriental Perfumes are made from a formula that for
centuries has been highly prized and most carefully guarded by
the great Master Chemists of the Orient. No American or
European manufacturer can produce a perfume anywhere near
as fragrant, no matter how skillful their organization or how
finely equipped their laboratories are. The ingredents were
the first secret preparations to be used by those learned Ori­
ental Chemists to whom the world is deeply indebted for
Oriental Perfumes and Sweet Smelling Incense. Perfumes made
in this country carry very little if any lasting fragrant odor
with them, their body being alcohol, and, on account of this,
they in time lose their scent.
Exquisite Oriental Perfume is used exclusively by de
Laurence’s student’s of Occultism and Spiritualism. Its Ori­
ental fascinating odor is one of which the most sensitive person
never wearies; for it has an irresistible charm impossible to describe. It is delicate and
refined, unusually lasting, and as stated, is used exclusively by Occult students, Healers,
and those seeking higher development, as well as followers of Oriental Philosophy and
Hindu Occultism in India, for it gives forth a subtle, powerful and beautifully fragrant
Oriental odor. Its influence is said to be wonderful.
The time has come when everything is Oriental, that is to say, people outside of the
Orient are today using Oriental Incense to burn in their homes and business places. It is
generally held that the burning of genuine Oriental Incense drives out bad influences
and helps one to succeed in all undertakings. All we ask for the Oriental Perfume listed
in this catalogue, is that you try it. Many people use a small amount of this perfume
daily on their handkerchiefs, for the reason that they believe it brings about a condition of
good health and assists them in overcoming diseases of the head, nose, throat and lungs
when inhaled or placed on their clothing. A few drops on the pillow or bed clothes is said
to be helpful for inducing a quiet and restful sleep by invoking a good influence.
The Magical Tradition of all ages attributes a certain supernatural and divine quality
to Oriental Perfume and Incense. Prophetic inspiration is said to adorn the soul of the
one who uses these sacred things. The Disciple of Occultism regards VALE OF KASH­
MAR PERFUME, with its equisite odor, as the Goddess Of Mystery and of Solitude;
while the Sage and the discreet Adept uses it as a means of obtaining inspiration and
Spirit Sight. The Initiates of all Eastern Orders of Sacred Mysteries would never think
of trying to invoke spirits or develop Occult powers without burning Temple Incense and
using Oriental Perfume on their robes and clothing while doing any Occult work. Who­
soever has studied the science of Spiritual Vision knows that one should use these things
if they wish to obtain satisfactory results.
It is in Egypt and India that Magic attains the highest grade of completion by its
Disciples using exquisite Oriental Perfumes and plenty of Incense. Of all the prepara­
tions used in the Ancient world, for the development of Occult powers, nothing surpasses,
and, indeed, nothing equals those wonderful perfumes and sweet smelling Incense pre­
pared by the old Egyptian chemists.
Unity of being, and unity in the harmony of things, according to the ascending and
descending scales; progressive and proportional evolution of the soul; immutable law of
equilibrium and graduated progress of universal spiritual power, is never completely
obtained only through the constant use of high grade Oriental Perfumes and the burning
Incense. Only unto the true Soul who uses these things is added Revelation and Illum­
inating description of the creative agent, the Pantomorphic Fire, the Great Medium of
Occult Force,—in a word, the ASTRAL LIGHT.
FRAGRANT ORIENTAL PERFUME
Little need be said here about the Virtue and Efficacy of Oriental perfumes and Incense,
as all familiar with the work know that they are very powerful and requisite for the success
and perfection of all various operations and communications with the unseen world. Hun­
dreds of thousands of years ago the ancients and masters all well knew the full meaning
of what has been written here regarding the Occult Virtue, which is inherent in subtle
Oriental Perfumes and Incense, and they well knew by what power they are so efficacious.
When you use VALE OF KASHMAR Oriental Perfume you will discover, as many others
have, that in delicacy, in refinement, in individuality, and, above all, in that indefinable
something which brings a broadening, brightening, fragrant influence that you have a
most exquisite Oriental Perfume. Popular Foreign scents and imported Perfumes are so
very expensive that people have not been able to buy them until we began selling VALE
OF KASHMAR at a lower price than domestic perfumes are sold at. This Oriental Perfume
is positively made under the direction of de Laurence. -Sold only in original One, Two and
Four Ounce Bottles with Ground Glass Stoppers.
THE de LAURENCE COMPANY 501
The Spiritual Influence of Perfume
The Magnetic Charm of this exquisite Oriental Vale Of Kashmar Per­
fume lies in the fact that it attracts a beautiful Spiritual influence. Many
use this Marvelous Oriental Perfume when Fatigued or Suffering from
Failure or Evil Influences. Vale Of Kashmar Perfume has had a steady sale
for over twenty-five years, because, as stated, it gives forth a beautiful subtle
fragrant odor that seems to clear the atmosphere of any adverse or evil influ­
ences. Like unto the Goddess Of Mystery its exquisite odor lingers about
you like a fascinating dream. A few drops on the pillow or bed clothes at
night many times is helpful in inducing a quiet and restful sleep accompanied
by good influences.
Sweet smelling Incense and Oriental Perfumes always have a lasting
fragrant Spiritual-like odor, and, as shown on the illustration above, is
believed to attract Good Spiritual Forces.
A Transmission of Spiritual doctrines and customs from generation to generation, usually by word of
mouth, or by example, but never written or printed, carries the belief, which has been handed down traditionally
through the ages, that Oriental Perfumes when used, have a good Spiritual Influence. Sol long has this faith
continued that it has almost become a belief that Oriental Perfumes attract very fine and beautiful Spiritual
Forces.

De Laurence’s "TALISMAN” HANDKERCHIEF
MONEY — SUCCESS IN LIFE — HEALTH — LOVE — KNOWLEDGE
SAFETY AND PROTECTION, REAL AND SPIRITUAL —POWER TO WIN
These are the "Subjects" of the Seven Seals of Solomon which
DeLaurence's "TALISMAN" HANDKERCHIEF Enables You
to Privately and Conveniently Carry on Your Person
Selected carefully with your needs and wishes in mind, the Seven allegedly “Powerful”
Seals of Solomon comprise a unified and organized example of the esoteric and recondite
wisdom and knowledge of the Ancients. The sources of THE GREATER KEY OF
SOLOMON are of indeterminate age—it undoubtedly comes from the deep, dark well
of the glorious and powerful past of the human race, perhaps even from some Golden
Age of great Strength and Happiness. Who can say what great results the Ancient
Adepts and Masters achieved with these materials, or indeed what can be done with
them this very day? These tools lie ready to hand—YOU have only to pick them up.
HOW TO USE THE SO-CALLED "TALISMAN" HANDKERCHIEF
This is a White, Genuine Rayon Handkerchief carefully impressed with an organized
group of Seven Seals of Solomon. It is recommended that it be carried on the person
as much as possible with the thought that the significance of the whole group may
by projection and association be of active importance to YOU. Either men or women
may carry it and use it freely. A little care while handling the “Talisman” HAND­
KERCHIEF in public will prevent anyone from knowing what great work is afoot.
One may try to keep the “TALISMAN” HANDKERCHIEF as clean as possible, men
carrying it in their billfolds or wallets, and women in their purses, although it may be
carried freely in the pockets if laundered or replaced at frequent intervals for obvious
reasons. A DeLaurence Special “Talisman” Case which may be had for $1.00 (Foreign:
8/-, or 100 francs) is of genuine leather and is ideal for this purpose. Anointing with
“TRANSCENDENTAL MAGIC” SPRINKLING PERFUME (one-half ounce §3.00,
foreign: 15/-, or 300 francs) is, we are told, frequently practiced with excellent results.
Launder the “TALISMAN” HANDKERCHIEF frequently with warm water and soap.
Its color is fast and it will retain its shape well. The purchase of six or twelve will
make the problem of having a clean one always at hand comparatively easily solved,
and results in a distinct saving. (See page 506C.) Buy DeLaurence’s “Talisman’
Handkerchief for every member of your family.
THE ALLEGEDLY "POWERFUL" SEVEN SEALS OF
SOLOMON MAY MEAN A GREAT DEAL TO YOU
MONEY
This is the Second Pentacle under Jupiter, which is believed in Astrol­
ogy to be deeply concerned with worldly acquisitions and material
things.' THE KEY OF SOLOMON says “This is proper for acquir­
ing glory, honors, dignities, riches, and all kinds of good, together
with great tranquillity of mind; also to discover Treasures and chase
away the Spirits who preside over them.” In the center of the Hexa­
gram are the letters of the Name AHIH, Eheieh; in the upper and
lower angles of the same, those of the Name AB, the Father; in the
remaining angles those of the Name IHVH. The letters outside the
Hexagram in the re-entering angles are probably intended for those of the first two
words of the versicle, which is taken from Psalm cxii. 3:—“Wealth and Riches are in his
house, and his righteousness endureth for ever.”
HEALTH
This is the Second Pentacle of Mars, a Planet closely associated with
conceptions of power and conflict, competition and striving and all that
these mean when earnestly undertaken. The pentacle is believed to
serve with great success against all kinds of disease. The letter He in
the angles of the Hexagram. Within the same the Names IHVH,
IHShVH Yeheshuah (the mystic Hebrew Name for Joshua or Jesus,
formed of the ordinary IHVH with the letter Sh placed therein as
emblematical of the Spirit) and Elohim. Around it is the sentence,
John i. 4:—“In Him was life, and the life was the light of man.”

IT IS SAID: THESE MAY HELP YOU. READ ON!
VICTORY
The Fourth Pentacle of Mars deals directly with conflict and war, and
with the fruits of conflict and war. It is said and believed to be “of
great virtue and power in war, wherefore without doubt it will give
thee victory.” In the center is the great Name Agla; right and left,
the letters of the Name IHVH; above and below, El. Round it is the
Versicle from the Psalm ex. 5:—“The Lord at thy right hand shall
wound even Kings in the day of His Wrath.”
of the function
SUCCESS
Consonant with mystical and necromantic conceptions
of the SUN, this, the Third of his Pentacles is held in authoritative
quarters to be closely allied with states of grandeur, development and
elevation. “All creatures Obey, and the Angelic Spirits do reverence
on bended knees.” The passage continues “This serveth in addition to
acquire Kingdom and Empire, to inflict loss, and to acquire renown
and glory, especially through the Name of God, Tetragrammaton,
which therein is twelve times contained.” The name IHVH twelve
times repeated; and a versicle somewhat similar to Daniel iv. 34:—
‘My Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and my dominion endureth from age to age.”
LOVE
The civilizing and cultural importance of the concepts of Venus are
valuable in themselves. Everywhere she is the projection of kindliness
and affection, honor and fair-dealing, good will and pity. Many in
probably all ages have felt that her Pentacles were proper for
“Obtaining grace and honor, and for all things which belong unto
Venus” not the least of which are Physical and Spiritual Love and the
accomplishment of all of your desires therein. The letters round and
within the Pentagram form the Names of Spirits of Venus. The
versicle is from Canticles viii. 6:—“Place me as a signet upon thine
heart, as a signet upon thine arm, for love is strong as death.”
V KNOWLEDGE
©
Mercury under whom this Pentacle is agreed to function, is the deity
of Wisdom and Wit, business ability and intelligence—and memory.
This, Mercury’s Fourth Pentacle stands for the acquisition of the
understanding and knowledge “of all things created,” and for seeking
out and penetrating into hidden things; “and to command those Spirits
which are called Allatori to perform embassies. They obey very
readily.” In the center is the Name of God, El. The Hebrew letters
inscribed about the dodecagram make the sentence, “IHVH, fix Thou
the Volatile, and let there be unto the void restriction.” The versicle is:
“Wisdom and virtue are in his house, and the Knowledge of all things rema
him for ever.”
PROTECTION D
The Fourth Pentacle of the Moon “protects,” according to the
GREATER KEY OF SOLOMON. “This defendeth thee from all evil / /
sources, and from all injury unto soul or body. Its Angel, Sophiel, AZ Y’X
giveth the knowledge of the virtue of all herbs and stones; and unto 111 h
whomsoever shall name him, he will procure the knowledge of all.”
The Divine Name Eheieh Asher Eheieh, and the Names of the Angels vX
Yahel and Sophiel. The versicle is: “Let them be confounded who ____
persecute me, and let me not be confounded; let them fear, and not I.”

MARVELOUS INVENTION
THE LUNAR CIRCLE
For Spiritual Vision. The Spirit World Unveiled.
The Unseen Universe Of Human Disembodied Spirits
The Lunar Chicle is a most marvelous invention, by de Laurence, and is very similar
in many respects to the Perpetual Lamps of the ancients, which at all times, day and
night, in all places, constantly threw out a perpetual flame of astral light, which could
not be extinguished. The extraordinary magical effects of this strange invention are like
unto an astral apparation, owing to the fact that its soft luminous light can only be seen
when it is placed in a dark room.
The Lunar Circle is used exclusively for the development of Spiritual Vision or
Spirit Sight, to induce the Clairvoyant State, and also for the induction of the trance state
of successful mediumship. This is positively the greatest instrument to use for the
development of occult and spiritual powers, as it even surpasses the famous “Persian
Mirrors” now being used by many in Europe: This very same Lunar Circle is used by
the Hindu, the Arabian, and the Thibetan to place themselves in the trance state so that
they can enter into direct communication with human disembodied spirits. By the use of
de Laurence’s great invention, The Lunar Circle, your development should be made
much easier.
It was invented by this great Adept for the sole purpose of assisting those who have
found it hard and difficult to develop, or to obtain, a satisfactory degree of clairvoyant
sight.
There are many good reasons why the study of Magic, and the development of
Trance Mediumship as well as Clairvoyant Vision is not found easy by all. Western men
and women have at times found it difficult, and practically beyond their reach, because
they have never studied de Laurence’s books on Occultism, Magic and Spiritism, de
Laurence has more students and followers than all the other teachers in America put
together because he is the only man competent to teach white-skinned people, who must
make all their efforts in this direction at home, not being able to go to India. White­
skinned men and women must have a certain kind of instruction because the majority
of them are not endowed, at first, with the mental qualifications necessary, de Laurence
has for years made a special study of this question, and his books cover these points so
well that any earnest beginner advances rapidly from the start. This truth could not be
better stated. If Occultism, Magic and Spiritualism have a future in the West, it is in
the keeping of such men as de Laurence.
As stated above, The Lunar Circle, with its vari-colored eternal light, which glows
perpetually like an astral flame, has been produced by the greatest living Master and
Adept, de Laurence, for the exclusive use of those who wish Spiritual Vision.
The great demand in Europe and America for The Lunar Circle—which is sold
direct, prepaid, for the mere trifle of ?l-50—may be found based on something more
scientifically exact than many suppose. Those who have used it speak of the beneficial
and peculiar influence it seems to exert over them while “sitting” for development. They
ascribe to it a certain Occult poiver, when used in a perfectly dark room, which every
advanced student of spiritism will readily understand, for its perpetual deep glow is
said to help produce extraordinary clairvoyant powers.
The astral light is the most modern electric of all lights and can be increased to a
Magical proportion. In the presence of the striking phenomena, which has been attained
by de Laurence’s students, ordinary investigators stand speechless; they do not even at­
tempt to conjecture as to the reason, and naturally, for they have not yet learned to look
outside the ball of dirtf upon which they live, and its heavy atmosphere, for the hidden
influences, and occult forces, which are affecting them day by day, and, even minute by
minute. Instead of expounding the rule of divine law and justice they preach the doc­
trines of theology and church dogmas, which have been rubbed threadbare by the most
serious minds of the day. Materialism, and the dogmas of so-called Christianity, have
been found to be, on the whole, subsersive, rather than promotive of spirituality and good
morals. False teachings and ignorance hardened the heart of Pharaoh, put an evil spirit
into Saul, sent lying messengers to the prophets, and tempted David to sin; they are—
the Bible-God of Israel.
The true soul will greatly appreciate The Lunar Circle, and will feel grateful to
de Laurence for placing it within his reach, as it will surely help him to lift aside the
curtain, and to see the spirit world unveiled.

THE LUNAR CIRCLE DESCRIBED
(CONTINUED FROM PRECEDING PAGE)
The Lunae Circle is produced on hard metal which is first cut into a square of given size.
Upon this square there appears a pale tinted Circle. When, however, the square piece of metal
is placed in the dark there instantly appears a strange, and apparently supernatural, glowing
light, which shines forth like the Egyptian sepulchral lamps, once found in such profusion in
the subterranean caves of Memphis.
The Lunar Circle, of Perpetual Light, is one of the most sacred instruments of the Adepts;
they use it when performing their mysterious rites, its light illuminating their solemn faces.
The Lunar Circle can be used for self-development, as stated heretofore, and it can also be
used by healers and those employed in giving distant mental and magnetic treatments; it is also
used by hypnotic operators. Many have found it difficult, while sitting for development in a
light room, to keep their mind centered on a thought or any article they were using for the reason
that their attention would, in spite of them, be attracted by the different objects in the room.
Again, many have found it almost impossible to induce the clairvoyant state, owing to the fact
that they could not center their mind inwardly long enough to gain any degree of trance. Silence
and complete control of one’s attention, while sitting for development is absolutely necessary
if one would advance to a superior degree of occult power.
The Hindu Adepts, in their temples, demand complete silence, and all their disciples are
trained and developed in dark chambers. Outside of these great Masters’ Temples the Oriental
sun may be setting, and its last flickering rays are seen at the doorway; but within the disciple’s
Occult Chamber all is complete darkness. This, added to the oppressive silence which reigns,
greatly assists the Chela (disciple) in his development of Spiritual Vision.
Amid this silence and darkness the Chela (disciple) slowly unwraps his piece of metal, upon
which has been produced a perfect Lunar Circle. This he stands on a low bench before him, and
at once proceeds to place himself Tri a state of deep meditation. For the space of one or two hours
daily he gazes steadily at The Lunar Circle. It is thus that he takes his first steps in Occultism.
The awful silence of the western prairies of North America, the boundless steppes of Southern
Russia, the sandy deserts of Mongolia, the barren solitudes of the deserts of Africa, are all noted
for their oppressive silence, but even these places, which are usually utterly void of life, cannot
be compared to the disciple’s Occult Chamber when it comes to a question of silence and dark­
ness. The Adept's Temple holds many an Occult Mystery, which has been shown to these great
Masters, whose rites and doctrines are purely spiritual, in the silence and darkness of their
Occult Chambers which are never lighted except by an Astral Light.
The above will, of course, provoke naught but incredulity in the general reader. However,
this has been written for those who will and do believe; who, like de Laurence, and his advanced
students, understand and know the illimitable powers and possibilities of the human astral soul.
On the Adept’s altar burns a curious perpetual Astral flame whose phosphorescent light is
as radiant as moonbeams. This apparently supernatural light mingles with the vacillating
exquisite odor of burning Temple Incense.
The Lunar Circle is produced on unbreakable metal. It is absolutely new in Europe and
America. It is made from a secret preparation, and is absolutely guaranteed to throw off a
bright luminous light, devoid of sensible heat, when placed in a dark room.
This apparently supernatural luminous light is guaranteed to last over a great period of
time. It is an eternal light, and in many respects resembles the Perpetual lamps of the ancients,
for it glows constantly when placed in a dark room. A perpetual luminous light in the form
of an exact circle which cannot be extinguished. Place it in the light and all you see is a square
piece of hard unbreakable metal, upon which appears a white circle with a background of ivory
white. Hang it in a dark room, and it instantly radiates a refulgent phosphoric light whose effect
is as quieting as moonbeams poured vertically through an opening in the roof. This Circle,
with its perpetual luminous light, has caused the greatest wonder when used in spirit circles. It
also has a most startling effect if placed in a dark room at night. The Lunar Circle is original
with de Laurence, and is without doubt an exceedingly useful thing in the hands of an earnest
investigator.
The wonderful and secret preparation used in producing The Lunar Circle absorbs the rays
of light during the day, and these rays are emitted when it is placed in a dark room, producing
a soft light, blue at first but gradually changing to a bright, ivory-like light, showing The
Lunar Circle in almost startling relief continuously while in the darkness. The darker the
room the brighter The Lunar Circle glows. Its luminous effect is everlasting. It can be hung
on the wall or stood on a table. It can be carried in the pocket. It can be seen anywhere on
the darkest night. It is now being used exclusively by de Laurence’s advanced students through­
out the world, and the highest words of praise have been received commending The Lunar Circle
to all earnest students of the occult.
For the beginner it is especially useful, for what a great help it is to have a Lunar Circle
of glorious perpetual light to help you center your forces. The Lunar Circle has been carefully
concealed by de Laurence from all excepting his personal students, and no stranger has been
admitted to witness its effect, de Laurence has at last, however, consented to its sale over our
mailing list, for a certain length of time at a very low price, and it would be well for those who
are interested in these things to take advantage of this unprecedented offer. Private students
have always paid $5.00 each for The Lunar Circle with the strictest understanding that it was
never to be exhibited to a stranger.

The Crucifix Of Christ
Its Luminous Effect Is Everlasting
The Darker The Room The More It Glows
Higher Spiritual Influences. This Lunar
Crucifix of Jesus is especially appropriate
for hanging in your room, where Spiritual
Meditation is carried on, or in your De­
veloping Room, or in any place where
Christian, Spiritual or Mental Healing is
administrated. It is a well known fact that
the Crucifix has been “blessed” and without
doubt, at all times, and in all places, gives
forth a good Spiritual Influence. Many
who are conscious of this, that is, Christian
Scientists, Christian Healers, Mental Heal­
ers, Spiritualists, Mediums, Practitioners of
Suggestive Therapeutics, and those who
believe in the Attraction and Invocation
of Higher Influences, always welcome and
are glad to obtain anything that reminds
them of the Spiritual Power Of Christ.
The Subterranean Caves Of Memphis.
This Handsome Luminous Crucifix is a
work of art. The Corpus, or figure of
Christ, is made of metal and richly finished
with a certain Preparation which covers
it. During the day this Preparation ab­
sorbs the white and yellow rays of the
light. Strange to say when this Crucifix
is hung in the dark there constantly ap­
pears a strange, apparently supernatural
glowing light, which shines forth like the
old Egyptian Sepulchral Lamps once
found in such profusion in the Subter­
ranean caves of Memphis. This cross with
its soft luminous perpetual light when hung
in your sleeping room where it can be seen
seems to promote sound sleep.
To Sleep Without Fear. The Crucifix of Christ, when hung oh the wall near the bed
where it can be seen often helps one to procure sleep, sound and secure so that you
not only sleep well, but sleep without danger, ever protected by the Spiritual Power
of Jesus; for: Whosoever hangeth up the Cross of Christ, and believeth thereon, may
sleep the sleep of the “blessed” at any hour or in any place.
The Cross Of Christ. Many believe that The Cross of Christ will ward off any dis­
astrous conditions or circumstances which might be cast upon them. If your enemies
have disposed you of credit, and caused you to be mistreated and thereby reduced your
strength and health, or deprived you of your position and installed another in your
place, you should find much comfort, and possibly the ability to overcome them and put
them to failure and shame, if you believe in the Cross of Christ. -
Ivory-llke Light. Should you doubt any of the statements made here regarding' the
fact that the whole and the entire body of Christ on the Cross, can be seen when hung
tn an intensely dark room, or at any hour during the night, or that this secret prepara­
tion put over the corpus or figure of Christ absorbs the yellow rays of light during the
day, so that these rays shine forth during the night when placed in a dark room,
producing a Luminous Light; Yellow and Light Blue at first, and gradually changing
to a bright, Ivory-Like Light, showing the figure of Christ in almost startling relief
continuously while in the darkness; you may order it and if this is not true return it at
our expense and your money will be refunded. The darker the room the more It glows.
Its luminous effect is everlasting.
A Work Of Art. This beautiful Luminous Crucifix of Jesus, is a work of art. The corpus,
or figure of Christ, is made of metal and richly finished with the same preparation which
is used on the Lunar Circle. The cross, on which the corpus is mounted, is made of very
hard wood, ebony color.

THE LUNAR CRUCIFIX
(CONTINUED FROM PRECEDING PAGE)
BEHOLD THE LUMINOUS CHRIST FIGURE
Especially appropriate for your developing room as it can be hung on the wall. Now used
by spiritualists and mediums throughout the world, as it undoubtedly attracts a good influence
and helps to invoke spirits of high order.
This beautiful Luminous Crucifix, of Jesus The Master, is a work of art. The corpus, or
figure of Christ, is made of metal, and richly finished with the same secret preparation which
is used on The Lunar Circle. The cross, on which the corpus is mounted, is made of a very
hard wood, ebony color.
The marvelous secret preparation, put over the body of Jesus, absorbs the yellow rays of
light during the day, and these rays shine forth during the night, or when placed in a dark room,
producing a brilliant light, Yellow and light Blue at first, and gradually changing to a bright,
ivory-like light, showing the figure of Ch/rist in almost startling relief continuously while in the
darkness. The darker the room the more it glows. The Luminous effect is perpetual.
To Destroy A Bad Influence And Rebuke Diabolical Arts
Many have steadfast faith and belief that this marvelous Lunar Crucifix is efficacious and
possesses extraordinary powers, which are said to destroy and rebuke a bad influence, and to
overcome the diabolical arts of certain witches and sorcerers. Everyone, who has made any
study of the subject, knows that a great number of persons of both sexes have entered into a pact
with evil spirits, and by their practice of black arts, sorcery and witch-craft, they strike with
sterility the conjugal bed, destroy the germs of humanity in the bosom of the mother, and throws
spells on them, and set a barrier to the multiplication of horses, cattle, etc. The diabolical arts of
certain witches and sorcerers are firmly believed in by many people. The following are among
their most dreaded powers: To inspire love and hatred at will; to send an evil spirit to take
possession of a person and torture him; to expel him; to cause sudden death or an incurable
disease; to strike cattle with sterility. Provoke unbounded passions in men and women,
etc., etc. The sight alone of a man said to be such a sorcerer, excites in many profound terror.
In order to overcome these things, and to assist them in rebuking certain bad influences, many
hang this Luminous Crucifix of the Master Christ in their room, or in any place where they
believe a bad influence prevails.
To Sleep Without Fear
It is said that one of the marvelous virtues of this LUNAR CRUCIFIX of Jesus The Master,
is, that if it is hung on the wall near the bed where it can be seen, it will procure sleep, sound and
secure, and that the owner thereof may not only sleep well, but sleep without danger, even from
evil influences. FOR WHOSOEVER HANGETH UP THE LUNAR CRUCIFIX OF CHRIST, MAY
BE BOLD TO SLEEP AT ANY HOUR IN ANY PLACE.
The LUMINOUS CRUCIFIX has excited extraordinary interest because of the efficacy it is
believed to have in preventing and warding off any very distressing condition or circumstances
which might be cast upon one.
If your enemies have despoiled you of credit, and caused you to be mistreated, and thereby
reduce your strength and health, or perhaps deprived you of your position and install another in
your place, they will be put to failure and shame, so it is said, if you have the LUMINOUS CRUCI­
FIX of Jesus in your sleeping room.

we have made a special combination price for the two when ordered at one time. See Order No.
233 below.
These two marvelous inventions, The Lunar Circle and The Lunar Crucifix, go well
together and make a very strong combination for the attraction of higher forces of nature which
flow so rhythmically around all mankind. The genuine Occultist uses these life force's in treat­
ing the sick, and to quicken his development. Again, the Occultist uses .these forces to create
for himself and for others, wealth, position, health and other material things. Yellow and Light
Green Astral Currents of occult forces are said to be the highest and strongest which vibrate on
this planet as they embrace the Blue Cosmic currents of Astral force, which is the highest in
spiritual qualities; Red being the lowest.
To acquire the ability to attract and control these forces man must develop to a given
degree; when he does this, he can attach himself to the Yellow Cosmic currents of Astral forces,
and can accomplish anything along the line of occult or spiritual work. An undeveloped person
cannot accomplish anything because he cannot use the Yellow nor the Blue Cosmic currents of
forces; they vibrate much higher than his own, and there is no sympathy between him and them.
As stated above, both The Lunar Circle and The Lunar Crucifix absorb the Yellow rays
of light during the day, and at night, or when placed in an intensely dark room, throws off a
luminous light; Blue at first, and gradually changing to a permanent phosphorescent glow. This
marvelous emission of light, without sensible heat, when placed in a dark room, after exposure
to light, has proved of great value, as it seems to help the investigator and student to come
more perfectly into vibration with forces much higher and stronger than his own.

Genuine Virgin Parchment
Made From Polished Lamb Skin
Talismans For Success, Honor, Health, And Wealth
For Man’s Love, Woman’s Love, Magical Pacts, And
Rituals Can Be Used For Making Any Kind
Of Charms, Talismans, Amulets, And Seals
It is a Hidden and Secret Truth that the Ancients used only Genuine
Virgin Parchment, made from the skins of dead-born lambs, for making their
Talismans, Seals, Charms and Amulets. The old Egyptian and Hindu Kabalists
always traced their Talismans upon Genuine Virgin Parchment, and it is said,
"that their Talismans were 'strong and useful,’ having wonderful power in
producing certain effects.” The Ancients claimed, "that their Talismans gave
to the wearer victory over every earthly enemy when they were rightly
formed on Parchment, and worn or carried about the person in a Genuine
Leather Talisman Case where they would remain clean and unspotted.
The Genuine Virgin Parchment, listed on the next page is hard to obtain. In fact, it is
imported and to be obtained only at certain places, owing to the fact that it is made from the
skins of dead-born lambs. Again, the process of preparing and polishing it with pumice-
stone is a very expensive one.
Publisher’s Note. Read at the bottom of this page the definition cf Parchment as
given in Funk & Wagnalls’ “New Standard Dictionary Of The English Language.”
Genuine Parchment can be used for copying and tracing Charms, Talismans, Amulets,
and Seals. Talismans for Honor and Health; also for attracting the Opposite Sex; for
Man’s Love; for Woman’s Love; for Magical Pacts and Rituals, and Ceremonial Magic.
Charms for working Bewitchments and Spells as well as Black and White Magic, are as a
rule always traced upon Virgin Parchment as it is an old belief that it makes them more
effective. In short, it is an old belief, which has survived the ages, that No Charm, Talis­
man, Seal, Symbol, Amulet, Phylactery, nor Philtre is thought to be effective unless it is
produced upon Genuine Parchment Paper made from the skin of a lamb.
Talismans On Parchment Paper
An able writer on the subject of Talismans, says: "Constructed by
Rules, the Talisman on Parchment Paper is usually carried in the
pocket in a Genuine Leather Talisman Case so it will remain clean
and protected from injury. No one should touch or see it after place­
ment except the person for whom it is designed, and only when it has
wrought its effect should it be discarded. This method is adopted by
natives of India. As to the Invocation, the act of making a Talisman
on Parchment Paper is an Invocation. Faith does the rest. A number
oj Talismans may be worn at once.”
Some time ago there was published a history of the famous Rothschild Talisman,
which is an heirloom, and the possession of which the fortune of the family is believed
to depend. It is in the form of a small Gold Casket, about the size of a snuffbox, but.
the Secret of its Power lies hidden in words inscribed within. Napoleon was a great
believer in Charms, and wore upon his body a Talisman given him by one of the Priests
after the Nile Expedition. Talismans are largely in use on the Continent, by Arabs,
Persians, and Hindoos, while in Africa, among native tribes, the Obeyah is much in repute.
Captain Welby reports that in Abyssinia he discovered races of giants who inhabit the
devil-possessed district of Walamo. He was a victim of the Magical Powers of the
Walamo, and “was quite unable to explain the cause of his mysterious business.” These
people use Magical Powers, and no Abyssinian can approach the tribe. In other coun­
tries we have instances of Bewitching, and the Evil Eye.
Parchment As Defined In “The New Standard Dictionary” Is As Follows: Parchment.
The skin of sheeps, goats, lambs, young lambs, and other animals prepared and polished
with pumice-stone for writing, painting and engraving, etc. Vellum is a fine parchment
made from the skins of calves, kids, and dead-horn lambs; while drumheads are made from
wclfskins, battledores from ass-skins, and selves from the skins of the goats. Virgin
Parchment. A fine parchment made from the skins of new-born Iambs or kids.

MAKE YOUR OWN TALISMAN ON GENUINE VIRGIN PARCHMENT
A great deal of interesting information regarding Talismans
to Insure Success, Overcome Disease and Enemies, and to Pro­
mote Health and Success in Business and Trade is to be found
in “THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH BOOKS OF MOSES;” also in
that Curious work on Ancient Talismans and Magical Rituals
known as “THE GREATER KEY OF SOLOMON.” de Lawrence’s
“GREAT BOOK OF MAGICAL ART, HINDU MAGIC, AND EAST
INDIAN OCCULTISM” also gives the student and investigator
valuable information on Talismans and Seals; how they are
constructed and etc. There are many today who use Genuine
Virgin Parchment to trace their Talismans on. They make these
Talismans themselves to ensure-their wishes and desires, after
noted books mentioned above. “THE BOOK OF BLACK MAGIC
contains a large number of Talismans with full information for
their construction and use.
For the benefit of those serious minded Occult Students who wish to make their own
Talismans and want to be sure that they are really obtaining Gcnu’-.e Virgin Parchment
we have listed the same below.
The maker of Talismans relies also upon the Magical Properties of Numbers and of
Geometrical forms as is taught in “The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic and
East Indian Occultism,” by de Laurence. To these are added Words having Power, and,
as by the Word the Universe was created* certain forces in Nature spring into activity.
For it is not words that stir a man to anger, pity, or love, but the spirit that ensouls the
words, so teaches de Laurence, the greatest Occult teacher alive today. The Kabalist uses
such seasons for his work as are in agreement with the purpose; and effects happen
from Conflagrations of the Planets. Therefore, all that is done under good influences
comes to good effect, whether by Sigil, Charm, or Talisman; it is effected by the Faith of
the Operator, aided by his Will and Imagination. Imagination is the Creative Power of
the Mind by which a mould is delivered to Nature for the reception of the Vitalizing Ele­
ment of the Will. For the Imagination is receptive, while the Will is Protective. What is
the mind of the Adept in Occultism, is replaced by an Ardent Imagination and Conscious
Will directed to the creation of definite ends. And to this extent all Lovers, Poets,
Artists, and Authors are equal with makers of Empires and Reformers of the world. Only
when art fixes form and voice to the powers, which reside in Nature, is their efficacy
brought within the control of the Human Will, as powder and shot which have been,
wrested from the earth and fashioned to a purpose. “The Power of the Will and the
Intention of the Soul is the main point in Occultism, Spiritism, Diseases and Medicine.
A man who wishes everybody Well Will Produce Good Effects. One who grudges every­
body all that is good, and who hates himself, may experience on his own person the
effects of his poisonous thoughts.”

He claims that if the directions are

affected by magnetism. Some spiritual­

The RADIO PSYCHO-TECTOR is
suspended from the fingers with the

concentrate on some question or prob­
lem he wishes answered, the instru­
ment will swing back and forth like a
pendulum, which movement, it is as­

circle, the movement is said to mean
“no”. No movement signifies poor con­

For Particulars Regarding The Marvelous Hindu Magic Mirror And
The Famous Message To All Mystics, See Following Pages
524 THE de LAURENCE COMPANY
A Message To All Mystics
Written Down By L. W. de Laurence
THE HINDU MAGIC MIRROR
Copyright, 1910, by The de Laurence Company, Publishing Dept.
This is a sincere and True Message to all faithful Brother and Sister Mystics and those
who may wish to know more about those Great Occult Organizations which exist on the Earth
Plane and in the Spiritual or unseen world.
My supreme desire is to educate capable and sincere brothers and sisters to act in concert
with good spirits and to teach them the work that they must do preparatory thereto.
Furthermore, be it known to ail the world, and especially so unto him or her into whose hands
this Message may come, not by reason of their own solicitation, or by advertisement, but by their
own Spiritual influence, that this message to those who desire to rid themselves of the bounds and
shackles of failure, ignorance, superstition, and materialism, regarding the famous “Magic Mirror,”
that wonderful Astral Instrument so long used by leading Mystics, Adepts and Occult workers for
communication and preparatory development for communication between the two worlds, will help
all who heed.
Every soul will rest at some mile-post in life
Those never ending, unnumbered, unknown points
All void, vacant, and dark,
Yet, be still for, as it looks once more.
A multitude assembled;
Unnumberable Astral souls reveal a force Supreme,
Invincible for human advancement,
The annulment of man-made law;
The concert uplifting and educating of humanity.
Listen, Oh ye capable brothers, for out of darkness
Comes this mystic message.
PART ONE OF A MESSAGE TO ALL MYSTICS
PART ONE: UNTIL YOU, BROTHER AND SISTER, “KNOW THYSELF” AND THE
POSSIBILITIES OF “THYSELF,” BY AND THROUGH THE UNDERSTANDING OF “SELF,”
AND ARE ABLE TO develop the Spiritual Forces within your own soul, there is certain spiritual
work for you to perform.
The shackles and chains of centuries, of cycles of ages, of antiquity, are riven at length by
their own corroding and heart-eating rust (materialism).
Let ye, oh brother and sister, listen most attentively, for no shackle or bond that comes
of materialism, darkness or superstition, or gross ignorance, can ever endure the full light of
spiritual truth.
To carry this work onward to its and your own full success I must have true, faithful,
sincere and capable brothers on the Earth Plane who have common sense (sense that is not
common), and who will act in full concert with me for the uplifting and Spiritual Education of
humanity.
No city code, or man-made law, can overthrow, annul or set aside the laws of God (SELF­
NATURE). The progressive Mystic who has received his or her Occult Education will always
act unselfishly, for they have by their education become Nature’s (GOD’S) own legitimate and
true instrument in human advancement.
They have steadfastly met and overthrown error, superstition, materialism, ignorance, and
arrogance in high and so-called holy places, and have thus denied the so-called Divine right
of those who would scoff at spiritism.
They have without hesitation uprooted and overthrown the rule of despot and tyrant, have led
true brothers and sisters with the potent weapon of mental thought and Astral force, to triumph
over superstition and ignorance, and will finally be the means of ending the reign of materialism and
selfishness who can exist only for a time, and times, and half time.
Before the truths of spiritism the bonds and shackles of fettered humanity are destined to melt
as snow beneath the Sun of Aries.
Do not be so foolish as to ask whether yon are a Mystic or whether you can develop sufficiently
to communicate directly and personally with the unseen world.
Each and every sensible and true soul possesses within itself these possibilities which are
simply the attributes of Divine Soul Powers. Of coursp you may suppress and crucify them, or
permit them to lie dormant, but only to your own loss and sorrow; or you can allow them to
thrive and bloom, like the lotus blossoms on the river Nile, to a beauty and power that will allow
you to outstep those who have devoted themselves to. more Inferior studies and pursuits.
Are you superstitious? Are you orthodox? Are you stingy? Are you selfish? Are you a
doubting Tom? Ask yourself these questions.
These are the deep, treacherous, underlying false conditions you must combat and overcome.
Can you lay aside these selfish or superstitious instincts and work for the good and uplifting of all
worthy Brothers and Sisters instead of the aggrandizement of self! If you can, then you are
ready to begin.
If such you are, then every True Mystic will stretch out to you a helpmg hand over the
infinite spaces, from the dim, forgotten centuries, and recognize you as a true brother or sister
and comrade. You may rest assured, and the future will prove the truth of this statement, that the
reign of truth and absolute justice and absolute unselfishness ultimately will come to every planet.
To such culmination the progress of earth life is marked with every vicissitude that change and
man-made laws may imply. ... , , „
When such a condition has been brought about the planetary forces that previously indicated
so much sorrow and suffering are discovered to be essential to perfect social organization.
'Tis thus the condition of adversity is turned into the force of perpetuity; the disappoint­
ments of failures and obstruction and slow decay are turned into a condition of sure, safe advance-
mentinfinite force and infinite intelligence are infinitely good. If what you read here stirs the soul
and smoldering forces within you it Is the responding cry of your true spiritual self—your true
Ego__the Astral self, recognizing and responding to the desires and vibrations of the eternal SELF.
It rests entirely with you whether this warning and my recognition bears fruit or not.
If you decide to act, ponder and consider well my advice. “BE SILENT.” “BE ye wise as
serpents but harmless as doves.” A seed before it sprouts lies concealed, secret and silent in the
dark earth.
Jt Is tn tills condition that it finds its real and only opportunity for growth and development
(Continued on next page)
_________ THE de LAURENCE COMPANY_______ 525
Antagonistic elements can only sweep over it while it lies concealed; its work, growth and
development goes silently on. Such must be your self-development. So must your Astral ana boui
Forces develop while silently hid in yourself.
Neither money nor position will buy true knowledge, nor can they destroy true knowledge.
Astral Powers, and Soul Forces, cannot be measured with money. Your Magical powers
and great Astral possibilities must spring to life within yourself. Jesus, the greatest Master
that ever lived, said*: “Seek ye the Kingdom of God within you.” 1 admonish you likewise.
See well to it that you heed. You may be so orthodox as to think that you should not heed
and investigate, believing that Spiritualism should not be investigated, or that your development
should not be accelerated.
There is no subject, be it esoteric or exoteric, that is too sacred for true investigation, and it
is the peculiar province of the True Mystic to desire to reason on all hidden and Astral forces
with the utmost care.
The health of body, the energy and confidence that an order for truth and power inspires, mark
his progress. No doubters, no laggard, no dotard, charlatan, no miser, no selfish one may ever
hope to succeed, or overtake the fleeting feet of true Occultism and esoteric truths.
The true Master, Adept or Mystic must possess a will and Intelligence that develops and
brightens with attrition.
No scoffer, rib obstacle, should daunt him, no condition should bar him, nothing should hinder
or discourage him in his Astral development and search after truth.
He must acquire secret Knowledge and Mystic powers as a miser does wealth to hold—Ms
soul his strong-box; but, unlike the miser, he can give of his store and yet retain his all.
Steadfastness and purity of purpose and self are a necessary requisite while traveling the
rugged path of Occultism and Mystic development.
A master Mystic cannot enter into diseased or sensual conditions.
He may desire to set those Spiritual forces in operation that will assuage deepseated sorrow
and physical suffering, but he cannot be expected to bring sweet music out of Inharmonious notes.
To attempt to do so would of course be foolish and result in deep injury to himself. So I
say, BE PURE, save your vital forces and preserve them long into old age.
The true Mystic and real Master never dissipates his physical or sex forces. The dissolute,
sensual man does. The unspent and preserved sex and germinal forces surrounds you with a
beautiful purple aura, which envelops you always greatly to your honor as well as being conducive
to your development.
This beautiful aura and strength-giving element is dissipated and destroyed by sensual acts and
animal instincts. When this purple Astral Aura is preserved and its supply constantly increased
from day to day by pure acts and thoughts you will possess the means necessary for your develop­
ment and the practice of true Occultism and Spiritism.
Heed thee, then, that your Aura remains purple, unimpaired and preserved. For this reason
children are many times clairvoyant and possess Spirit and Inner Sight when their parents do not.
Condition Essential For Spirit Co-ordination And Communication
It now becomes my province to direct and indicate the way and manner best suited for com­
munication with the unseen world.
Try and fulfill all the requirements that I have indicated in the fore part of this communication
and those which hereinafter follow, especially those relating to the preparation and use of the
MAGIC MIRROR.
However, should you fail, do not be discouraged or cast down.—BE FAITHFUL, Faith­
fulness and application are all that will ever accellerate your development.
Persevere. To him or her who is faithful much help and assistance will be given. At some
future time, should you decide to become a brother or sister Mystic, you will know my meaning of
the above ; for I assure you I know full well how to handle this problem that has vexed so many
who insist on developing in their own foolish way.
However, after you start, should no apparent results be obtained, keep on, be faithful, perse­
vere, if necessary, for many years, yea, a lifetime.
Results and your capacity for work and perseverance will indicate the degree of your develop­
ment and advancement as a true and faithful Mystic, while the cardinal principles of true Co-ordi­
nation will promote and signify the progress of your development and communication.
Of course, if you really wish to identify yourself with the Spiritual world and enter into such a
relationship with it that you can communicate, you must place yourself, of your own free will and
accord, in harmony and accord with those vibratory Astral forces which Co-ordinate with your
own.
To obtain this class of vibratory forces you should read, then carefully re-read, this mes­
sage many times until you thoroughly understand its real esoteric meaning.
Next most carefully decide and fix in your mind just the kind of an ideal life you think a true
Mystic should live. Examine yourself as you would a peck of wheat, seeking both the inferior and
superior grains or qualities.
Take heed of each inferior quality and virtue you possess. Then, like a true man or woman,
decide to live what you believe to be the true ideal Mystical life.
After you do this see to It well that you live the ideal life and you will bless the day and hour
that this Message came unsolicited by you.
Until you so live the ideal life, do not expect to co-ordinate with the Higher Spiritual Powers.
Should you decide upon an ideal Mystical life many questions will come to you.
Anticipating this there follows here the answer to all important ones. First—Good, pure, un­
selfish thoughts are absolutely essential and demanded. Remember, you seek to identify yourself
with the Spirit World.
A pure riiind keeps away all vain fancies and mental delusions. Seek and you will find.
Aspire and you will be inspired. Perform any good deed you can; do not defer a good deed nor
a laudable ambition.
The proper time to do anything is when ambition inspires you to do it. Then your energy Is
sustained by a free and natural ardor and desire, and you are assisted by a clear conception,
unclouded by procrastination, which acts most effectively for success.
By living in a pure mental and physical condition, and rounding out your existence by con­
stantly keeping before you the ideal life of the advanced Mystic, you should rapidly advance to a
degree of spiritual light and Astral co- ordination where the spirits may be able to establish intelli­
gent communication With you.
But remember, it all depends upon your faithfulness and capacity to persevere until you have
advanced to a point where you can place yourself in a sphere of vibratory Spiritual forces that will
admit of perfect co-ordination.
(Continued on next page)
526 THE de LAURENCE COMPANY
When To Use A Magic Mirror
Now if you have begun to live the ideal life and have arisen to a degree where the good spirits
can co-operate with you through your Aura, you are now in a state where you can seek co-ordina­
tion, communication and relationship with the Spiritual World through a Magic Mirror.
Every wise Mystic constructs his own Opaque Magic Mirror, not because it could not be
made for him, but because, if he constructs it himself, it will be more certain to serve the occult
purpose for which it was made.
It will also more fully co-equal with his own cloisteral and monastic personality.
A Magic Mirror made under these circumstances, with an intense desire in the Disciple to
succeed, will not be as a means of preventing sodality and exclusive association between himself and
the Astral world, as would one constructed by another, impregnated and perverted with their
selfish corporeal magnetism and depressed lustreless Aura, which always serves as a bar to
your complete coalesce and association with those in spirit life.
If you wish to succeed, disassociate yourself with any individual whose sole object and pur­
suit is financial gain or who is of a mercenary nature.
If you make it a rule in life to disassociate yourself with any person who has a parsimonious,
stingy nature and who is always curmudgeonly in his dealings, you will be better off.
Stay entirely away from those of a churlish, penurious disposition, as they will surround you
With a muddy, mottled Aura or magnetism which will hold you back like a heavy fog or dismal vapor.
For this reason, unless you are careful, it is best to always live a sequestered and monastic
life as far as your business and earthly pursuits will allow.
Far better that you remain untrammeled than to have to do with the close-handed and niggardly.
Never get intimate or confidential with them or their kind.—Have no dealings with them', as they
are surrounded with an Aura that means death to your hopes.
Shun them as you would an abominable, odious, damnable thing, for if you could see them in
their true light, as the Mystic can, you would shrink and recoil from them as you would from
something that was loathsome and nauseating—accursed.
■Now, should you be interested enough to follow further, and it is purely your own affair whether
you do or not, you are going to be told that if you were in a position to see clearly, that is to say,
if your spiritual or Inner sight was developed, you would be able to observe many things which
are low and unbecoming in those around you.
SPIRIT SIGHT AT WILL
If you doubt this, it’s because it is concealed from you owing to the fact that you only possess
the physical sight. These things can only be observed by those who have Spirit Sight at will.
Does not your Christian Bible, tell you to “develop the inner or spiritual sight?’’
Common sense should indicate that it is your plain duty to possess Astral or Spirit Sight,
which the ancients called the inner or spiritual sight.
If you wish to own a real genuine Opaque Magic Mirror and be able to make it exactly as it
was made by famous ancient Mystics so that it will possess Occult Virtue and become infused
with Astral Auras, then proceed as hereinafter instructed, in this message.
Foremost, procure unto thyself the following materials from The de Laurence Company, with
which to make your own Opaque Magic Mirror.
One Convexo-Concave superior transparent glass which has a perfect and complete spheri­
city of form on the properly indicated side ; manufactured by a certain secret process and formed
by infusing silicious matter with fixed alkalies ; but so constructed that it possesses none of the
qualities of the lens, so that rays of Astral light passing through it are not made to change their
direction or to magnify or diminish objects at a certain distance, as does the crystalline humour of
the human eye.
In other words, this exclusive Convexo-Concave superior transparent glass must be so made
by a special process that it has no mitigating, assuasive or lenitive qualities whatsoever. The
exact size should be 7%x5% inches. Next, obtain a sufficient amount of a dead black substance
with which the Convexo-Concave transparent glass is to be coated. Also one very fine camel’s
hair brush. The entire cost for all of the above materials, securely packed, when sent in a special
mailing case to any post office in the world is not great
The materials referred to above were positively, previous to this communication, not obtain­
able anywhere in the world arranged ready for instant use as far as I know.
Next obtain a box with a lid on to hold your mirror. Next procure one yard of new cloth.
These are special materials from which you can make agenuine superior Opaque Magic Mirror.
The material for making a Superior Magic Mirror, thJ& is, the Convexo-Concave transparent
non-magnifying superior glass, and the substance to be used for coating your Magic Mirror, and the
fine brush also to be used to apply the coating, you may obtain as told above of The de Laurence
Company.
The box for holding the Magic Mirror, the yard of cloth and the pint of turpentine which you
will also need, you of course can easily obtain.' yourself at a nominal cost from the stores where
you reside.
These Convexo-Concave superior glasses for making the Magic Mirrors are prepared espe­
cially for this purpose and are sold by The de Laurence Company, who are the largest dealers
in these materials as well as standard Occult, Spiritual and Magical books and Temple Incense in
the world.
They also sell at a small cost very excellent Gazing Crystals, which no Mystic or Adept ever
thinks of being without.
A Mystic or real Adept would be in no better shape to carry on Occult or Mystical work
without his Crystal than would a man who tried to write with no ink in his pen.
Students and Mystics as well as others owe much to this progressive firm, whose business has
Increased so rapidly year by year.
This firm imports from the Orient and Europe, and in turn exports books and other
goods to every country in the world, de Laurence’s name is as well known in South
America, Gold Coast, Africa, India, British West Indies, Egypt, as it is in the United States.
After a careful canvass and checking up of sales it was found that there was scarcely a
city or town in the United States and Foreign Countries but what sheltered one or more
students who had purchased and studied this famous man’s books.
Another thing, students have de Laurence to thank for stopping dealers in charging
exorbitant prices for Occult books, Incense and Crystals, etc. A case in point is his recent
publication of a fine edition of that famous book entitled, “THE MYSTERIES OF MAGIC.’’
BY ELPHAS LEVI. Importers and London dealers sold this book for $15.00 a copy. The
de Laurence Company published a modern edition of this excellent work and sold it all
over the world for a low price. Still another case: “INDIA’S HOOD UNVEILED,” written
by a native of South India, was being sold in India at $20.00 a copy. Today The de Laurence
Company have their own exclusive edition of this work, and sells it for only $2.00.

HOW TO CONSTRUCT AND USE A MAGIC MIRROR
MESSAGE PART TWO: The turpentine, which you are to obtain where you live, you are
to use to thoroughly clean your brush and convexo-concave glass with. The dead black substance,
with which you are to coat the Magic Mirror so as to make it opaque, you will receive from the
de Laurence Co., ready mixed, and will not need diluting unless it should be too thick; in this event,
mix a little turpentine into it.
The brush MUST be new, as must be all the materials used in the construction of your opaque
Magic Mirror.
The box, which you are to obtain where you reside, may be of wood, but new. The cloth,
which you are to obtain where you reside, should be of purple or blue, and of goods very agreeable
to your touch and sight. If you cannot obtain blue or purple, get white cotton cloth; but under no
circumstances use rdd. After you have finished your Magic Mirror wrap it in the cloth when not
in use and keep it in the box.
With all materials ready you are to go into a room by yourself when all conditions are agreeable,
and proceed as hereinafter instructed. With a piece of new cloth (a small piece will do) clean
the concave glass of dust after dipping the cloth in turpentine. This will cause the dead black
substance to adhere to the glass when you apply it. Dip your brush into the black substance and
proceed to paint or coat the convex side of the glass.
The outside of the glass is the convex side and is the side to paint. Don’t paint the con­
cave or inside. Start painting at one end of the glass and proceed slowly until you reach the other
end. Apply the substance smoothly and as evenly as possible, not resting for any other purpose
until you have entirely finished your work. You must not go back over the glass, as any imper­
fection or streak in the coating can be remedied by the next coat of paint you are to apply on another
day. You are to apply three coats, one every day, which will be necessary to make this specially
prepared convexo-concave superior transparent glass Opaque.
HOW TO MAGNETIZE A MAGIC MIRROR
After you have painted the convexo-concave glass as above, allow it to dry for one day.
Next proceed to infuse into it the particular individual virtues of your own aura and magnetism.
This is accomplished as follows : Pass the right hand, palm down, in a circular motion over the
Mirror—your hand being about two inches above it. Repeat with the left hand. Then operate as
above, with both hands at once. You should, however, make any kind of a motion over the glass
that you feel impressed to make. Do all this with confidence, as it certainly pertains to your own
individuality. You should make no fancy motions for effect, but should keep your mind solemnly
on your task. Let your movements be deliberate and regular. See to it that the palms pass close
to the glass. At times allow the hands to stop near both ends of the glass. It is not the
movements of your hands, of course, that infuses and magnetizes your Magic Mirror. It is your
aura, which you have projected and transmitted into it. This dead black substance is of such a
nature that it readily absorbs your vital Aura and magnetism. It is the only substance known that
will do this so well.
Be sure that you! give this substance ample time to take on and absorb your Astral Aura so
that it becomes thoroughly infused and well impregnated with it while you are in a perfectly quiet
mental state of deep meditation, all the while keeping before you the ideal Mystic life you have decided
apon living.
After you feel that you have about exhausted your Aura and that it has been absorbed by the
substance on the Mirror, you should stop. Before and during the process of making your Magic
Mirror let yourself be prompted only by high aspirations and pure desires. Drive out all worry
and thought of self and earthly desires by meditating on your work and the purpose for which you
have made your Mirror. Read and re-read this message before you begin this work. After
you have prepared the Magic Mirror, then lay it upon a piece of heavy paper or cardboard, the coated
side up; place it in the box to dry, some place where it will not be disturbed and the atmosphere is
of an even temperature or nearly so.
Allow the cardboard to remain under the glass until you have infused or magnetized it. You
now have a Magic Mirror whose opaqueness will be perfect, and it will be ready for use three days
after you apply the last coat. These are the only complete instructions ever given out to the world
in print for this work, and it is given without thought or desire for pay—it being my desire and re­
quest that it be given free to all who are far enough advanced to appreciate their great value.
After you have finished the first, second and last coating, clean your brush with turpentine and
put it aside for future use. Also cork up your dead black substance tightly.
Once started, keep steadily on living your ideal Mystical life, as near as your conditions and family
affairs, if you are married, will allow. Examine yourself at the end of each day and resolve to do
better the next Try and avoid lapses. Live a life that each hour, each week, each month and each
year makes you better morally and stronger physically. Help those who are worthy and need
assistance.
This kind of a life will surely bring you health, peace of soul, and the inspiration to do good
will become stronger, as will your desire for truth and goodness. If you do this you will really feel
yourself getting stronger and better. You will feel your spiritual self unfolding. As you perfect
yourself and succeed in Astral attainments, so will you attract to yourself by your Aura higher and
purer forces and aspirations. With these there will come to you, and be added unto you, Astral
and Mystical powers that will well repay you for your efforts—the power that will make you a
power and a Mystic. Remember, Brother and Sister, that each should give according to his or her
ability and will receive according to his or her capacity.
This development, this inspiration, this Astral unfoldment, this progress, these powers—all these
—and more—must come from within—for, remember, “The Kingdom of God Is Within You.” With­
out this unfoldment of your Astral self all the spirits and Astral Powers in the Universe might be
ready to help you and obey your invocation but no results would follow their ministrations. You
must unfold. Astral Powers, Astral Sight, and, Spirit Sight Must unfold from within you.
You can blindly follow the childish instructions and methods of the so-called professors and
mediums and surface writers and so-called authors until you are tired, heartbroken and dis­
couraged, and you will never even be able to receive intelligently a spiritual or mental impression
from the unseen World, let alone being able to co-ordinate and enter into intelligent communication
with it.
With a heart destitute of selfishness, with your soul on fire for humanity, and a mind desiring
and aspiring for help and truth, always desiring to engage in good Occult works—all these fruits of
a good life—you will need and shall have the help and companionship of those good souls in the
Spiritual world.
Once your Magic Mirror has been constructed strictly according to the directions in this
message it will be necessary of course for you to give the spirits an opportunity to materialize and
also communicate with you.
This can be helped by your conforming to certain conditions as hereinafter indicated.
The first essential is regular sittings or periods of meditation, when you must get mentally and
physically quiet, so as to completely bring about a condition of receptivity to external psychic and
spiritual forces. You should go into silent and secret meditation at certain specified times and ob­
serve that you attend well this duty, always endeavoring to bring about a state of introspection.
You will observe I have advised that these sittings be secret. This of course is for your own
welfare and protection. Keep it from the curious and I do here admonish you in this beginning to

doubtedly change such a tentative art as medicine into an exact science, if the nature and laws that
underlie Spiritual and Occult forces were universally understood.
It does not disprove my claims, as contained herein, nor place them subject to ridicule, because
many are not initiated into their use or nature; else must many arts and sciences suffer the same
results.
All Sages, Seers and Mystics and members of all Standard and proficient Occult organizations
know by experience that Astral and Psychic Auras and forces do influence and control the psychical
and physical nature of men, women and children and, in short, all active life.
The Astral and psychic sight and the intuitions of all Ancient and Modern Mystics is perfect.
Results are as a rule more regular in Occultism than those said to be obtained from the un­
measured phases of religion; ethics; morality and some other branches of so-called human
knowledge and physical or material sciences.
People are fast giving up orthodoxy and religion and the more advanced of mankind are working
out the solutions regarding the Spiritual or inner self.
Indisputable facts manifesting the Astral and mental forces are attested to. by great and fearless
Mystics and men of research all over the world. . .
The near future will be devoted to the solution of man’s inner self. People are beginning to
greatly desire Spiritual vision and to understand the silent, ever-pulsating forces of the unseen
world.
Interesting, valuable and wonderful revelations are being secured by many today.
Many Mystics and advanced students have developed Astral and Spiritual consciousness by
studying my books.
The alchemy of life, Telepathy and Intuition, Dream and Trance states, wider states of mental
plane and consciousness of Astral Vision, Inherent Vibrant Astral force, higher Auras, Stages of
Clairvoyance, Psychic Vibrations, -which control the emotional and mental nature of men and women
and children, and interpenetrate the physical body for health or disease, are fully and most intelli­
gently treated in my books. The very fact that my books have been simultaneously accepted as
Standard and official by all leading Spiritualists and Occult students has convinced me, as well as my
record as a successful Mystic and Seer, that I am the proper one to give this message to you.
Again, I have more correspondence than any other teacher, besides being in the best position to
circulate it properly.
My works and teaching will go out to the intelligent world in spite of all the critics. I care
not for creed, color or clime, and this message will be read in Africa, India and America, as well as
in Judea and Galilee, Japan and China.
I have sincere brothers and sisters in all climes. All are WELCOME to test their psychic
qualities, or investigate the dynamic and psychic world, so that they may thereby obtain a better,
fuller and clearer conception of the possibilities, faculties, nature and qualities of their inner or
Astral self and the world of vibratory forces around them.
Concerning Soul Sight And Magic Mirrors
Written Down By L. W. de Laurence
Copyright, 1912, by The de Laurence Company, Publishing Department
This article has been published for two reasons :
, FIRST—To gratify the hundreds of inquirers who daily wish to learn more of the wonders of
the Hindu Magic Mirror and, SECOND—To give those who have faithfully read “A Message To
All Mystics,” and sent in their order for material for making a Magic Mirror, more light and
information about the Magic Mirror and how it is used and loved by the Hindus. This article and
;A Message To All Mystics” contains all that is necessary to be known upon the subject of Soul
Sight and Magic Mirrors.
India, Africa and the far East must ever lead the world in the practice and art of Magic, both
White and Black.
All the skill and mechanical ingenuity of the most expert prestidigitateurs of Europe or America
cannot produce a single exhibition which will compare with the Occult feats of the commonest
Hindu student of the real Occult and Esoteric Studies of India.
The Japanese have taught the greater part of the sleight-of-hand illusion which is daily paraded
before staring audiences in the United States and Europe, who are foolish enough to believe that
these crude jugglers of the stage and foot-lights, know anything at all about the true Magic of
India.
The so-called legerdemain, sleight-of-hand, and other foolish stage “stunts,” and that are being
constantly pulled off” before gaping crowds in cheap show houses, fairs, etc., is as boy’s play
compared with the mysterious Occult and Esoteric spirit and Magical work of the nether and
farther Indies, and especially of Siam.
The Masters of the latter country consist of a royal troupe of Adepts, who perform only at
funerals and coronations of the Kings, and then only in the presence of the nobles of Siam, or those
initiated into the mysteries of the Occultism and Spiritism of the country. These Masters do not
perform or read from their Magic Mirrors or crystals for money. They are of Noble blood, and it
is seldom that an European sees even their faces.
<<TT ,The best way is for the student to use some form of the Spirit Glass, or Magic Mirror, not the
Unm and Thummim,” or metallic breastplates used for purposes of divination, and worn by the
priesthood as recounted in the Bible ; nor systems of later days—but the perfected Spirit-seeing,
or Magic Glass, commonly known as the “Hindu Magic Mirror,” which can be made of materials and
fitted for use by your own hands.
These are of two generic kinds, and also of diverse grades, sizes, sensitiveness, focal power
and magnetic planes^—because those made for, and adapted to one line of use, are not so well suited
to, ^1Tffer?nt „lmes- The best Spirit Seeing Magic Mirrors are those described in “A Message To
All Mystics.”
„ These Magic Mirrors, when made strictly according to the instruction in “A Message To All
Mystics, from materials obtained from The de Laurence Company, are Magic Mirrors, adapted to
ordinary ends, such as reading in the Astral Light, invoking, and other Occult and Magical purposes
for Which they have for ages been used by all true Mystics and the deeper students of the Magi.
Many of the Crystals sold by catch penny dealers as well as books of instruction written
by s.?^,tac<Lwrlt+er^ a?d at- a T1,06’, ar„e, useless- for unless you obtain a standard work such
as. The Great Book of Magical Art, Hindu Magic and East Indian Occultism," vou will onlv meet
with complete failure in your efforts to reach perfection. ’ y
The difference between the very common Mirrors, such as are sold by cheap dealers, and those
Mirrors described, is the difference between a high-grade gold watch and a cheap one. Both ar” time­
keepers, but one is vastly superior to the other. The materials of the two classes of Mirrors are
Quite dissimilar, and this it is that renders these famous Magic Mirrors very valuable and adapted
to the uses for which, from noary antiquity they were intended. I have seen a very small Crystal­
line Magic Mirror, weighing less than a pound, for which the 'owner demanded a large amount and
was not at all anxious to part with it even at that price. The larger and finer Magic Mirrors re-
terred to m A Message To All Mystics,” are of coyrge far better, stronger, more perfect, and

have a great deal wider range. Formerly there were five sizes; but it was found that but one
could be depended on, as the rest were extremely liable to fracture by reason of the great climatic
ranges of temperature in Western Europe, India, Africa and North America.
These Magic Mirrors were also found better suited to beginners than any other obtainable,
especially those who, not content with the limited ranges of the ordinary ones, were anxious for a
perfected instrument of greater sensitiveness, magnetic calibre, focal range, Aethic basis, or
magnetic reservoir, and of a capacity equal to the solution of almost any subject capable of demon­
stration by j$uch means. However, the very best of all such things in that line is material for mak­
ing a Special Extra Heavy fine oval Magic Mirror with deeper, broader, larger basins, or magnetic
reservoirs, presenting dead black surface when finished, nearly absolutely perfect, and leaving almost
nothing to wish for in any respect—a beautiful, clear Dead Black Glass and of size, focal length and
calibre seldom equalled and never surpassed. ’ -
Should you obtain from The de Laurence Company materials for making your own Magic
Mirror and then proceed to make it exactly as instructed in “A Message To All Mystics,” you will
have something as near perfect as it is possible to obtain in an article of this kind.
The following is related regarding a Magic Mirror. The story as told is thus:
In' January, there was imported by a Mystic, material for making two Black Magic Mirrors.
After they were prepared, magnetized, charged and finished in the regular way, they were put into
a box. There they remained until one morning early in June, when they became suddenly illuminant.
and no grander sight, so the story goes, was ever beheld by human eyes than was presented on that
memorable morning; for the whole starry galaxies, rolling word-systems1 of nebulas, vast congeries
of stellar. constellations, cities afar off on the earth and astral scenes never before beheld by
eyes of this world, were displayed to such a grand, sublime and amazing extent that one was im­
pressed with the manifestation of such transcendent Phantorama. Such Black Magic Mirrors as
these, if kept free from promiscuous handling, treated judiciously and rightly used, are capable of
more Psychic Marvels than all the mediums on the globe, so it is said.
Magic Mirrors may be used by a room full of persons at the same time, being fixed immovably
and the people arranging themselves so that each one can see the surface; but no one, save the
owner, should either touch or sit or stand closer than from four to five feet, or more; and when
the seance begins, no word should be spoken, no movement made ; and it ought to open with an
invocation, or call to your best guide, while special invocations, for any given purpose or purposes,
may be made to lesser potential intelligences. The Magic Mirrors sold by The de Laurence
Co. have never been equalled; while their true Cuspic-Ovid, depth and breadth is most admirable—
appreciated by those favored ones who are true seers and born Mystics, as being immeasurably
superior to anything of the kind seen since the days of the Magi on the plains of Chaldea—for
great pains have been taken to make these glasses perfect Results depend upon the mode of a
Mirror’-s preparation, seasoning, application and magnetic manipulation, and not upon the glass itself.
Many ask why satisfactory results are not always obtained from Black Magic Mirrors made
from material sold by obscure dealers and those who really know nothing about matters of this kind.
The reply is this: You are advised to read “A Message To All Mystics,” as it explains what is
necessary to obtain and what is to be done in order to make a Magic Mirror.
Again, many in Europe and America do not understand why Spiritualism and Occultism, as well
as White Magic and Black Magic are so well understood in the Orient and the Far East. The fol­
lowing will throw some light on this subject.
People of the West (Europe, America) are not subject to the same extremes of passion (sexive)
as are Orientals ; and hence know not either its awful intensity or its terrible penalties, because they
dwell far more in the Brain than in the gender, far more in the physical than the Spiritual world;
wherefore they have less vere’elan and passional power than their brown brethren and sisters of
the far-off eastern lands. As a general rule, with occasional exception, they are unable to reach
the magnificent goals of Soul-vision and Spiritual Powers easily attainable by the sallow devotees
of India, and Saiva, and, therefore, cannot realize the intense passional furore, essential both to the
successful invocation of correspondent Aerial Potentialities, and the charging of Magic Mirrors with
divine spiritual reflective powers which characterize them. I here allude to a profound mystery
connected with their construction, known only to the initiate, but fully explained in “A Message To
All Mystics,”—a mystery at which Western people may laugh, provided they sense its nature, but
which higher souls must reverence, honor and adore.
Twelve Years In India
Written Down By L. W. de Laurence.
Says Colonel Stephen Fraser, In his glorious volume entitled “TWELVE YEARS IN INDIA.”
"We joyfully, gladly went—five of us, Her Majesty’s officers—on a tour of military inspection,
the toils of which were likely to be rewarded by an opportunity of witnessing the dance of
Illumination, of the MUNTRAWALLAHS, or Magic-working Brahmuns, whose strange miracles,
worked apparently by the triple agency of Battasahs (rice), Gookal (red-powder), and, strangest
of all, by means of Magic Mirrors and Crystals. These Magic Mirrors are black as night, in which,
it is reported, some very strange things were to be seen. Wo were all prepared to witness skill­
ful jugglery, for which the residents of Muttra* are renowned but fully resolved to ascertain, if
possible, how it was all done, rejecting, of course, everything claimed to be either supra-mortal or
hyper-natural, so far as the underlying principles were concerned. It was sheer Occult and
Spiritual skill, but such as no European could pretend to equal; yet how by their Black Magic Mirrors
they could tell the number of our watch date of coins and many other true and wonderful facts,
never having seen either of us before—because the dust of Jubplpore was still upon our clothes,
we having been but one day in Muttra—was a problem not easily solved.
“After reading Lane’s story about the Magic Mirror in his Modern “Egyptians;” what De Sacy
says in his famous “Exposition de la religion des Druses;” Makrisi’s account in his “History of the
Mamelukes;” J. Catafago and Defremeny in the “Journale Asiatique;” what Rotter affirms as the /
truth in his “Travels in Syria;” Victor L’Anglois, in “Revue d’Orient;” Carl Ritter; Dr. E. Smith;
Von Hammer in his “Hist, des Sasseins;” W. H. Taylor’s “Nights with Oriental Magicians;” the
“Gesta Magic!” of Lespanola; “Lettres Edifiantes et Curieuses;” Youett’s “Researches into Magic__ J&
Arts,” and innumerable other unquestionable authorities,—it was far less difficult to believe in the
existence of some Occult Visual Power possessed by these Magic Mirror-gazers, of both sexes, all
ages, and diversity of culture, than to attribute it all to chicanery and lucky guesswork. * * *
“Sahib, it true,” said our Wallah next morning, when speaking of the exhibition of the previous day:
“and now I s’pose you go see Sebeiyeh dance—(the Magic Mirror Bridal-fete of a renowned
Brotherhood of Mystics, Magicians)—no doubtee.” Well, we all determined to go, and a three hours’
ride brought us to a plateau in a mountain gorge of the Chocki hills. We were not too late, and were
kindly offered vantage ground of view by the Sheikh,—a man of at least 125 years of age, judging
from the fact that his grandchildren were white with snowy locks and beards waist long. * ♦ *
The two brides entered the circle followed by the two grooms, all four bearing large earthen
pots full of black, tar-like substance, which, on inquiry of the Sheikh, we learned was the product
of the volcanic spring of the Mahades hills, in the far-off province of Gondwana, in the Deccan;

*“Muttra, a town in the province of Agra (India), on the west bank of the river Jumma, in latitude 27 deg.
31 min. North; longitude 77 deg. 33 min. East, a place famous for the manufacture of Magical apparatus and one
the only two places on earth where Parappthaline gum is prepared, wherewith the Adepts paint the backs of these
extraordinary Mirrors, so celebrated by the various authorities named in the text.”—-Twelve Years in Indi#. Vol, 2, p. 286.

that it only flows in the month of June; is collected by girls and boys who are virginal,-—that is,
before puberty,—and must be prepared for use within the ensuing forty-nine days, by simu
persons on the eve of actual marriage, as it is supposed certain properties of a Magical JNatu
attach to it when handled by such persons, under such circumstances.
“Of course, I, with my western habits of thought and European education, could but laugn
at this, which seemed so very palpable and gross a superstition; and yet, strange to relate, wnen
I expressed my skeptical views to the old Sheikh, he laughed, shook his head, handed me two parts
of the shell of a large nut, and requested me to fill one with the dead black material, and the other
with the same after it had been prepared. I did the first, and reserved the empty shell for the
other, taking care to hold both in my hand well wrapped up in a brown bandana. ine
circle had a pile of stones in the center, upon which coals were brightly burning; and over this fire
—which, by the way, is the Eternal sacred Fire of the Garoonahs, which is never allowed to go out
from one year’s end to the other—was suspended from a tripod of betel rods a coarse earthen
vessel, into which the four expectant marriagees poured about one-fourth of the contents of the Simla
gourds already mentioned; amid the din of an hundred tom-toms or native drums; the clashing
of rude cymbalos (cymbals) and wild, clarion-like bursts of the strangest, and, shall I, a staid
Briton, confess it?—most soul-stirring and weird music that ever fell upon my ears, or moved the
man within me. After this was done, the Sheik’s servitors erected a pole near the fire, around wnicn
pole was coiled the stuffed skins of the dreadful hooded snake of India—the terrible Naga, or Cobra;
while on top was an inverted cocoa shell, and two others at its base-;—understood by the initiated as
symbolizing the Linga,—the male emblem, or creative principle of Deity; while the suspended vessel
over the fire represented the Yoni, or female principle; the tripod emblematizing the triple powers or
qualities of Brahma—Creation—Preservation—Perpetuation; the fire below corresponding to Love,
or the Infinite Fire which is in the Life of All; * * * And now began a strange, weird,
dance, to the wild melody of five hundred singing devotees of that wonderful Phallic, or sexual
religion; mingled with the mellow breath of cythic flutes, the beating of tambours, the thrumming of
various stringed instruments, and an occasional ziraleet, or rapture-shriek from the lips of women
and young girls, whose enthusiasm was unrestrainable, and who gave vent to it with wild movements
of their graceful and supple bodies, and in shrill cries that might be heard long miles away, like
voices from heaven awakening the echoes of Space; * ♦ * Advancing with a slow, volup­
tuous, rhythmic movement, not of the feet alone, but of the whole form from crown to toe, the.
girls—aged about fifteen, brown as berries, agile as antelopes, graceful as gazelles ; lovely, with
barbaric splendor, as an Arab’s ideal Houri;—they swayed, bent, advanced by twists and curves,
by nameless writhings, by sweeping genuflexions, by movements the very poetry of passions, but
passion of soul far more than of body, with suffused faces and moistly gleaming eyes, toward the
taller emblem, round which they slowly whirled and danced, ever and anon stirring with a silver
spatula the dark substance contained in the vessels they bore. This by turns. While the two youths,
bearing similar vessels, performed corresponding movements about the vessel which symbolized
Nature in her productive aspect—until we five Europeans were lost in a maze of astonishment at
the capacity of the human frame to express mutely, but with more meaning and eloquence than a
thousand tongues could convey, the amazing heights, depths, and shades of passion, but a passion
totally free from vulgarity or indecency; and as pure as that of the ocean billows when they kiss
each other over the grave of a dead cyclone ; * * * Observing my surprise, the old Sheikh
touched my arm, and in purest Bengalee whispered: “Sahib, ARDOR begat the Universe. There
is no power on earth, either for good or ill, but Passion underlies it. That alone is the spring of all
human action, and the father and mother alike of all the good and evil on Earth. It is the golden
key of Mystery, the fountain of Weakness and of Strength; and through its halo alone can man sense
the ineffable essence of the Godhead. .The materials in the vessels are charged with life,—with the
very essence of the human soul, hence with Celestial and Divine Magic Power for, O Sahib, it is
only lust and hatred that keep closed the eyes of the soul;—and in the Magic Mirrors whose backs
we cover with the contents of these five vessels, the earnest seeker may behold, not only what takes
place on earth, but also what transpires on other globes, and in the SAKWALAS of the Sacred
Gods—and this is the only true Bab (Door).
“I turned once more to the dances of the Aleweheh, who by this time were moving in more rapid
manner to the quickened strains of the more than ever wild and fantastic music. * ♦ ♦ Three
of them began stirring the contents of the cauldron, into which all the materials from the gourds
had now been poured; murmuring strange, wild bursts of Phallic song the while ; and the fourth,
the taller maiden of the two, stripped herself entirely nude above the waist and below the knees ;
her long raven hair streaming around her matchless form—a form of such superlative contour,
proportions, lively peachblow tint, and rounded beauty, as made me blush for the imperfections of
the race that mothered me. There were no violent exertions of legs and arms ; not the slightest
effort at effect; none of the gross motions in us in the West, on the stage or off it—whose palpable
object is the firing of the sluggish blood of half-blase spectators ; but a graceful movement, a
delicious trembling, half fear, half invitation;—a quivering, semi-longing, semi-reluctant undulation of
arms, bosom, form, eyes even—rippling streams of most voluptuous motion; billowy heavings
and throbbings of soul through body, so wonderful, so glowing, that one was spellbound by the sight.
And yet there was absolutely nothing suggestive of -coarse, gross animal passion in all this trans­
cendental melody of hyper-sensuous motion; on the contrary one felt like seizing her by the waist,
drawing his sword and challenging all earth to take her away, or disturb her tranquillity of celestial
—what shall I call it?—I am lost for a name.
“Presently both the girls joined the Mystic Sensuous-Magic Dance; and one of them seized me
suddenly by the arm and dragged me to the central vessel, saying, “Look, Sahib, look.” I did so, but
instead of a black mass of seething, boiling gum, I beheld a cauldron bubbling over with the most
gorgeously pink-tinted froth that imagination ever dreamed of; and while I stood there marveling
at the singular phenomenon—for the very bubble took the form of a flower—lotus, amaranth, violet,
lily—rose—the old Sheikh drew nigh and said, “Sahib, now’s the time,” pointing to the bundle con­
taining the empty shell and the one already half filled. Acting on the suggestion, I held forth the
empty shell; into which the girl ladled about a gill of the contents of the swinging vessel; and the
Sheikh produced two perfectly clean Magic Mirrors, over which he poured respectively the contents
of the two shells, and held both over the fire for a minute, till dry, and then, handing them to me,
said, “Look, and wish, and will, to see whatever is nearest and dearest to your heart.” Internally
I laughed, but he took the two shells, and while he held them, I looked into the hollow face of the
Magic Mirror which was covered with the singular dead black substance first handed to me and
gazing steadily about half a minute,—the mystic-dance going on meanwhile,—I willed to see my home
and people in far-off Albion ; but nothing appeared. The old man smiled. “Now look at the other
Magic Mirror, which is a true Bhatteyeh—full of divine light and imperial power, and you will------”
Before he finished, I glanced into the other Magic Mirror, and—scarce hoping that the Western
reader will credit me with anything loftier than a vivid imagination, fired almost beyond endurance
by the lascivious surroundings in the midst of which I was—I nevertheless deary and distinctly
affirm, on the hitherto unsullied honor of an Englishman, and a colonel in Her Majesty’s service
that I saw a wave of pale, white light flit like a cloud-shadow over the face of the mysterious
Magic Mirror, and in the center of that light a landscape, composed of trees, houses, lands, lowing
cattle, and forms of human beings, each and every item of which I recognized as the old familiar
things of my boyhood and youth, long ere the fires of ambition had turned my face toward distant
India, I beheld the simulacrum of a dear sister, whom I had left in perfect health. I saw her to
all appearance very, very sick,—the physicians, nurses, troops of friends, and faithful servitors
gathered around her ; she was dying; dead. I saw the funeral cortege set out for the cemetery
and I marveled greatly that they buried her by the iron ribs of a railway; because, when I left’
no road of that kind ran through my native town. I saw the silver plate on her coffin, and most
clearly and distinctly read the inscription thereon; but the surname was one I had never heard of.
(Continued on next page).
532 T H E d e L AU R E N C E C 0 Al P A N Y
I looked up at the Sheikh, who was eyeing me with strange interest and intensity, as if to ask
an explanation; but he only smiled and repeated the one word, “See.” Instantly I turned my eyes
to the Magic Mirror again, as likewise did three of my European friends, and, to my and their
utter astonishment, beheld a shadow, an exact image of myself, standing near the well-curb of my
native manse, weeping as if its heart would break, over the prostrate form of my elder brother
who lay there dying from a rifle bullet through the groin,—the result of an accident that had just
befallen him while in the act of drinking from the swinging pail or bucket. Now came the most
astonishing phenomena of all,—for each of the three friends, who were looking with me, started
in suprise, and uttered exclamations of undisguised astonishment, for each had seen things
beyond the range or pale of trickery or the play of excited fancy. One beheld the three forms of
his dead father, sister and uncle,—the latter pointing to a sealed packet on which was inscribed the
words, "Dead—Will—heir—Oct. 11th. Go home.” The other beheld the drawing-room, and its
occupants, of the old house at home ; and on the table lay a large pile of gold coin, across which
lay a legend, thus: "Jem and David’s winnings: Lottery: Paris: June 18th: 10,000 pounds.” The
third man saw a battle or skirmish waging in the Punjaub, and his senior officer struck down by a
shot in the side, thus opening the road to his own promotion. Much more we saw and noted in that
wonderful scene of diablerie, portions of which I shall detail at length hereafter. But it became
necessary to attend to other matters. I did so (as will be hereinafter cited), and then accompanied
the Sheikh to his tent, where the marriage was celebrated ; and he told me there certain wonderful
secrets in reference to the further preparation of the strange material composing the reflective
surfaces of the curious Bhatts, which, while exceedingly mystic and effective, at the hands and
offices of the newly married people, is yet of so singular and delicate a nature as not to be
admissible to these pages ; for, while really of the most holy and sacred nature, yet the miseduca­
tion—in certain vital respects and knowledges—of the civilized Teutonic, Anglo-Saxon, and Latin
races, would render the matters to which I allude subjects of either not well-based blushes or out­
right mirth.
“ * * * Seven long months after these memorable experiences, I parted with three of my then
comrades, and, accompanied by two others, embarked on one of the steamers of the Messageries
Imperial.es, from Bombay, homeward bound. Before I left, one of my friends had sold his
commission in consequence of having fallen heir to an uncle’s estate, who, the letters of recall
stated,- had died in England, on Oct. 10th, and not on the 11th, as the Magic Mirror had stated.
It had actually takgn the difference of latitude, and was correct to an hour. The second man,
on arrival in England, proved the truth of the Mirror, for Fane, not “Jem,” as the Mirror stated,
and Davison, not “David,”—cousins of his—had fallen on a lottery fortune of over a lac of rupees
in India money. The other officer was promoted in consequence of the death of his lieutenant­
colonel, in a skirmish in the Purijaub, which event was the result of a shot in the loins, not in the
side. Arrived at home, I found my people in deep mourning for my younger sister, the widow—
after a wifehood of less than a year—of Capt. H------, of Her Majesty’s Navy, whom she had met
for the first time only a few months before their marriage. I had left for India five years before,
and though I had often heard of my brother-in-law’s family, yet we had never met. He went down
in one of the new crack ironclads on her trial trip. The awful news occasioned premature mother­
hood ; she died, and her remains were deposited in the hillside vault, skirting which was a railway
just 'equipped and opened for traffic a month or two prior to the marine disaster. Lastly, with­
in eight months after my return I became sole male heir to our family property in consequence of
the death of my brother by a charge of shot, not a bullet in the groin, as the Mirror showed, but
full in the abdomen, while climbing a fence for a drink at the brookside, and not at a well. Every
fact shown so mysteriously was proved strangely true, though not literally so. I, just previous to
my departure from the strange bridal, asked the old Sheikh some questions, and learned that the
Black material on Magic Mirrors, wherein we saw the strange miracles, was but partially prepared,
—as my readers will also recollect—but some which he placed on a Magic Mirror and gave me
just before I left, and which had been fully prepared, the finishing process being a secret one and
conducted by the newly wedded couples by a peculiar process—and nameless—never showed me
anything which was not true while in my possession ; for I confess I lost it from a silly servant
having shown it boastingly to- a gypsy, who stole it that same night, through the most adroit bit of
scientific burglary I ever heard or read of. The loss, however, was irreparable, for I have
since found that these strange Muntra-Wallahs, as they are contemptuously called by their Islamic
foes in the Carnatic (but true magi in the opinion of better informed people), have brother
Adepts in nearly every country on the globe—Brazil, China, Japan, Vienna, and even our own
London and America; while they have a regular lodge in Paris, of some of whom the initiated,
and favored ignorants even, can and do obtain occasionally, not only well-charged and polished Magic
Mirrors, but actually, now and then, a gourd full of Moulveh-Bhattah,—the strangely mysterious
substance which constitutes the seeing surface, as mercury does in the ordinary looking-glass, and
the two are alike in all save that the latter reflects material and the physical, while the former
sometimes—but not at all times, or to all people, or to the successful seers on all occasions—
reveals only the Astral or spiritual world, and unseen forces that survive the body.
“Heaven help all who are subject to witchcraft or the black art; for the magician will bring up
the hated one’s astral enemy—and then strange influences will seize him or her.”
*****
Thus much by way of information. Those who have read the works of Mundt, Hargrave,
Jennings, Lawrie, Palgrave, Morier, Lane and de Laurence need not be told that these Hindu
Magic Mirrors have been imitated often, but without avail; for, unless they be true, not a
cloud even can be seen. There is another secret about them which is revealed in “A Message to
All Mystics.”
Some persons have been disappointed in such, because a host of spirits, or all mysteries
of the heavens, or gold in the ground, or hidden money, etc., were not at once revealed in the Magic
Mirror. I never used one for any such purpose ; but I sat and gazed upon it, awaiting patiently
for aught that was vouchsafed in the way of visions or phantoramas.
This is their negative and immeasurably lowest use. The highest is to sit gazing until the
gazer shall pass into a transcendently lofty and most interior state—absolute, unequivocal supra­
clairvoyant condition, and then, ah, THEN, as myriad glories unfold and roll before the soul’s eyes,
the seer is every inch a Master of The Occult by the positive results that are obtained by the
use of the Hindu Magic Mirror.
The Magic Mirror offers an easier, better and safer method of development surpassing the
boasted clairvoyance of America, England or France. Many are using their Magic Mirrors today
as an instrument to give life readings and for lettering themselves financially. The old usages of
India and the Orient will always be superior to the more modern methods of the West, which are
vicious perversions from the true and normal methods. All those who follow the foolish methods
taught by Western mediums and professors must, will, and do fail, for the most that can be accom­
plished by their instruction, is to bring students into contact with earth-bound evil influences that
they cannot identify; and for this reason methods of this kind are doubly dangerous.
But the question arises with many: “Can any and every one successfully use the Magic
Mirror?” And the reply is, Yes. Not every one can see in them, without long practice. However,
most every one can develop by an hour’s steady use every day, together with the faithful application
of WILL, ATTENTION, CONCENTRATION and PERSISTENCE. This develops soul, thereby
growing the power of death-survival and ensuring immortality. For I hold that those who cannot
see In them at all. or produce clouds, or other magnetic effects, after first trial, may rest assured
tnat they lack the great essential to immortality, and unless they cultivate soul power and strive
ror It, when death lands their bodies in the grave their inner selves will remain undeveloped.
Others can see in them, if not at once, then iii periods varying from several weeks or longer

THE HINDU MAGIC MIRROR
Vast Spiritual Realms
For many ages people have sought some medium, instrument or means by which
they might penetrate through or lift the veil which hangs between the world we inhabit
and that vast Spiritual Realm where causes reside and principles exist. To that end
recourse has been had to various so-called marvelous methods taught by fake spirit­
ualists, would-be mediums and silk-hat professors, all of which in the end have proved
unsatisfactory. No person can reach the interior sight, develop or read in the Astral
Light by such methods.
To all who have failed so far, there is still hopes of a way, within the reach of every
one, which require but the elements of Time, Patience and Constant Practice to ensure
very good results, if not complete success in soul-sight.
A good way is for the Student or Investigator to use some form of Spirit Glass or
Magic Mirror. Full details regarding the Construction, Magnetizing, and use of the
Famous Hindu Black Magic Mirror is contained in “A MESSAGE TO ALL MYSTICS" by
L. W. de Laurence, also a noted article, “SOUL SIGHT AND MAGIC MIRRORS” by the
same writer. Both of these are published in pamphlet form and are sent free of charge
to any one interested and who will send 10 cents in stamps to pay for addressing and
posting same. All who desire information on Esoteric subjects and special instruction
on various .points regarding the use and care of the Magic Mirror, should read this
pamphlet; for it also contains “THE GENESIS OF THE HINDU ADEPTS;” written down
by Li W. de Laurence.
How To Obtain Material For Making A Magic Mirror
If you wish to own a real genuine Opaque Magic Mirror and be able to make it exactly
as it was made by the ancient Mystics you may procure the materials, from which you
can make your own Opaque Magic Mirror. This material consists of one Convexo-Concave
transparent glass which has a perfect and complete sphericity of form on the properly
indicated side. This piece of glass, from which the Magic Mirror can be constructed, is
formed so that it possesses none of the qualities of the lens, and rays of Light passing
through it do not change their directions or magnify or diminish objects at a certain
distance, as does the crystalline humour of the human eye.
This Convexo-Concave transparent glass is made so that it has no mitigating, assuasive
or lenitive qualities whatsoever. Its size should be about five and twelve-sixteenths of
an inch by seven and twelve-sixteenths of an inch. With this piece of Convexo-Concave
glass you receive a sufficient amount of Superfine XXX Drop Black. This preparation is
ground in Japan and is quick drying. It is used to give the glass three coats on the
outside so as to make it Opaque or a glossy black. A suitable brush to apply this XXX
Drop Black is sent with the glass as per order numbers below.

The slower the development, the grander will be their astral sight when patience and faith and
attention shall have brought it. A few are utter failures with them; but the successes outnumber
them a thousand to one. Those who would learn more of these matters are referred to the
special work on that subject, “A Message To All Mystics.” When this Message was written no
first-class Magic Mirrors were on this continent; now there are many good ones; the material
for making them having been obtained from The de Laurence Company.
Magic Mirrors may be used in a company, or circle of from five to ten persons. When used
by a single person, the front may be gazed at; but a glorious surface is presented edgewise, or
obliquely. In circles, the company, whether it be few or many persons, should sit in a semicircle ■
the Mirror leaning against a black background. Let all be still and motionless, and then carefully
note the result. The use of the Magic Mirror for magnetizing or influencing those of either sex is
not approved; for, although easily done, yet favors thus gained are not apt to benefit hence cannot
fully satisfy the needs of the human soul; yet it is good to stir the medicine for the'sick with the
finger in the hollow of the Magic Mirror ; for by such means it can be quadruply charged’ with the
divinest and most living, therefore healing, influence of the tremendous soul of man.

THE CRYSTAL, THE MAGIC MIRROR AND THE SEER
By de LAURENCE Any attempt by Western men
at a scientific explanation of the
phenomenon of “Crystal Gazing’’
or “Mirror Gazing’’ would perhaps
fall short of completeness, and
certainly would depend largely upon
the exercise of what Professor
Huxley was wont to call “the sci­
entific imagination.’’ The reasons
for this are obvious. The Hindus
know considerable about atomic
structure in relation to nervous
organism. We are informed to a
certain degree upon atomic ratios ;
we know that all bodies are re­
garded by the physicist as a con­
geries of atoms, and that these
atoms are “centers of force.” Pri­
marily, the atomic theory would
refer ’all heterogeneous bodies to
one homogeneous substance, from
which substance, by means of a
process loosely referred to as
“differentiation,” all the elements
are derived. These elements are
the result of atomic arrangement,
and the atoms of each are known
to have various vibrations, the
extent of which is called the “mean
free path of vibration.” The in­
destructibility of matter, the fact
that all nature is convertible, and
the absolute association of matter
and force, lead to rhe conclusion
that since every change in matter
implies a change of force, matter
must be ever-living and active, and
primarily of a spiritual nature.
The great Swedenborg, no less a
scientist than a spiritual seer, laid
down his doctrine of “Correspond­
ences” upon the primary concept
of the spiritual origin of all force
and matter. Matter, he argued,
was the ultimate expression of
Spirit, as Form was that of Force.
Spirit was to Force what Matter
was to Form—our ideas of Matter
and Form being closely related.
Hence, for every Spiritual Force
there is a corresponding Material
Form, and the material or natural
world corresponds at all points
with the world of spirit, without
being identical. This, in brief,' is
the conclusion to which the “scien­
tific imagination” of the present
day, extending as it does from the
known into the unknown, is slowly
but surely leading up.

536 THE de LAURENCE COMPANY
For those who would aspire to the gift of pure vision, and in whom the faculty is striving
ior expression, the following pages are written. To others we would say, Be content. All birds
are not eagles. The nightingale has a song, the humming-bird a plumage which the eagle will
never possess. The nightingale may sing to the stars, humming-bird to the flowers, but the eagle,
whose tireless eyes gaze into the heart of day, is uncompanioned in its lofty loneliness in the barren
mountain-tops.
QUALIFICATIONS
THERE are in existence certain magical works, written by de Laurence, wherein the use of
the Crystal is accompanied by certain rites and invocations. This ceremonial magic is taught in
de Laurence’s “Great Book Of Magical Art, Hindu Magic And East Indian Occultism.” It brings
into play a number of forces which may well prove what is written here. All action and reaction
are equal and opposite. A child might easily fire a cannon, but could not possibly withstand its
recoil. So in the education of the spiritual faculties, it is better to encourage their natural develop­
ment by study than to invoke the action of stimulants which we may not afterward be able to
control. The continual fretting of the water will wear away a rock, though none doubts the water
is softer than the rock. If the barrier between this and the soul-world be like granite, yet the
patient and persistent action of a determined mind will sooner or later wear it away, the last layer
will break down, and the light will streak through, dazzling the unaccustomed eyes with its
effulgence.
It is my desire to indicate by what means and by what persons the natural development of
the clairvoyant faculty may be achieved.
First, in regard to the subject, medium or seer. There are two distinct temperaments in
which the faculty is likely to be dominant, and capable of high and rapid culture. There is the
nervous temperament associated with a high muscular development, classified as the “mental­
motive” temperament. It is characterized by extreme activity of body and mind, a certain nervous
excitability, prominent features, full osseous development, prominent brows, intent gaze, and
generally a swarthy complexion. This type represents the positive seers, in whom the mind goes
out toward the images of the soul. The other, in whom the passive temperament is present, and
to whom the soul-images come by passive reflection, as things mirrored in a moveless lake, are
known by the following characteristics: Full and lymphatic habit, pale or delicate complexion,
generally blue eyes, straight fine hair; small plump hands and quiet voice.
These two types—of which there are many varieties—achieve their psychic development by
quite opposite means. The positive seer works with effort, throwing out the soul-images by the
power of his will, perceiving them with more or less accuracy, and thereafter turning them over
in the mind, reasoning and questioning concerning their import and meaning. The passive seer,
on the contrary, works not at all and makes no effort, the visions coming slowly, almost impercep­
tibly, and in most cases having a literal interpretation. The visions in this case are not allego­
rical, emblematic, or symbolic, as in the case of the positive seer, but are actual visions of facts
just as they have happened or will transpire in the future. Of the two orders, the passive is the
more serviceable because the more perspicuous, but it has the disadvantage of being largely under
the control of external influences, and hence capable of “Seeing.”
The positive type of seer exercises an introspective vision, searching inwardly toward the
soul-world whence the revelations proceed. Of what nature these revelations are will appear
in the following pages. The passive type of seer, on the contrary, remains in statu quo, open to
impressions coming inward toward the perceptive faculty, but making no effort toward either out­
ward or inward searching. The success of each depends upon the observance of that method
which is agreeable to their respective temperaments.
In regard to the qualifications which should supplement and sustain the natural aptitude of
the seer or seeress, the following remarks may be of general service.
Self-possession and confidence in one’s own soul-faculties must be the firm rock upon which
all revelations should rest. The purer the intention and motive of the seer, the niore lucid will
be the visions accorded. No reliable vision can be obtained by one whose nature is not inherently
truthful. Any selfish desire dominating the mind in regard to any thing or person will distort the
visions and render them misleading, while a persistent self-seeking spirit will effectually shut the
doors upon all visions whatsoever. Therefore, above all things it is essential for the investigator
to have an unflinching love of truth, to be resigned to the will of Truth, to accept the revelations
accorded in a spirit of grateful confidence, and finally to dispel all doubt and controversy by appeal
to the eyes of one’s own immortal soul. These are qualifications with which the seer or seeress
should be invested, and if with these the quest is unsuccessful after a period of earnest trial, it
must be taken as sufficient warrant that the faculty is not in the category of one’s individual
powers. Happily, the same qualifications brought to bear upon some other psychic faculty will
result in a rich recompense.
PRELIMINARIES
Having obtained a good Crystal, resting on a Genuine Crystaline Holder, care must be taken
to keep It as much as possible in a dark place when not in use. The best covering therefore is
a black one of soft material, such as velvet, which will not scratch the polished surface of the
Crystal.* Exposure to the sun’s rays not only scores the. surfaces of the crystal, but also puts
the oclylic substance into activity, distributing and dissipating the. magnetic force stored up
therein. It must not be understood that the visions are in the crystal itself. They are in the soul
of the seer. But the odylic substance is acted upon by the nervo-vital emanations of *the body
of the seer, and reacts upon the brain centers by means of the optic nerves. That is why it is
necessary to keep the Crystal as free as possible from disturbing elements. For the same reason
when in use, the Crystal should be overshadowed by the seer, and so placed that no direct rays
of ligXt from the sun, or lamp, or gasolier may fall upon it. The odyle, as has been already
stated, rapidly responds to surrounding magnetic conditions, and to the vibrations of surrounding
bodies, and to none more powerfully than the etheric perturbation caused by combustion—indeed,
to light of any kind. , , ,, ,
For similar reasons the room in which the sitting is conducted should be only moderately warm
and shady as possible, provided it be not actually dark. A light by which one can just see to read
average print is sufficient for the purpose in view. The Crystal with which I have had) the most
satisfactory and surprising results is a 3-Inch Crystal with A Genuine Crystaline Crystal
Holder. See Order No. 213. , ,, , A
It is important that all persons sitting in the same room as the seer, should be at arm s length
away from him—farther if possible. Silence should be uniformly observed by those present. A
recorder should be at hand to set down everything the seer may give voice to. If any questions
are addressed to the seer while the sitting is inj progress, they should be spoken in an undertone
and as nearly a monotone as may be, so that the seer is not suddenly surprised into consciousness
of his surroundings, and the psychic thread thereby broken. .
At first the sittings should not be of longer duration than, fifteen minutes, but it J
important they should take place regularly every day or night if possible, and always
the same hour and in the same place. By this method of procedure it will be found t*-
cumulative effect is produced and success more speedily insured. The reason is o
All actions tend to repeat themselves, to become automatic, and hence the psychic

THE de LAURENCE COMPANY 537
will, if actuated at any set time and place, tend to bestir themselves toward the same end as that
to which they were first moved by the conscious will and intention of the seer.
Until definite and satisfactory results are obtained, not more than two persons should be
present at the sittings, and these should be in sympathy with the seer and each other. When the
sitting is over, it will be found agreeable and useful to discuss the results obtained; or if none
are elicited, the seer can give an account of his or her impressions and feelings during the sitting.
It will be interesting to note these expriences and to compare them from time to time.
The seer or seeress must not be disheartened if at the first few sittings nothing of any moment
takes place, but must persevere, with patience and self-control. Indeed, when one comes to
consider the fact, that for hundreds of generations the psychic faculties inherent in mankind have
lain in absolute neglect, that perhaps the faculty of “clear vision” has never yet been brought into
activity by any save the .most remote of our ancestors, it will not be thought remarkable that it
should be at first difficult to get any definite results. Rather should it be a matter of surprise that
the power is still with us, that it is not wholly irresponsive to the voice of the soul. While, in the
course of physical evolution, many important functions have undergone remarkable changes, and
organs, once active and useful, have become stunted, impotent, and in some cases extinct; yet it
is said that seeds have lain dormant in arid soil for hundreds of years, to spring into leaf and
flower as soon as the rains have fallen and the climate changed. The faculty of pure vision is
like the latent seed-life. It waits only the conditions which favor its growth and development; and
though for hundreds of years it may have lain dormant, yet in a few days, weeks, or months it
may attain the proportions of a beautiful flower, a thing of wonder and delight, gracing the garden
of the soul.
THE VISION
VISIONS seen in the crystal are of two kinds, both of which may be conveyed to the perception
of the seer in two ways. The two kinds of visions are: 1. Direct visions ; 2. Symbolic visions.
The first of these is a representation of scene or incident exactly as it will transpire, or has
already happened, either in relation to the seer, those sitting with him, or yet in relation to public
affairs. The second order of vision is a representation by means of symbol, ideograph, or other
indirect means, of events similar to those conveyed by direct vision.
In most cases it will be found that answers to questions take the form of symbols. But this
is not always so, as will appear from the following remarks concerning the manner in which these
impressions or visions are conveyed to the perception of the seer.
The vision is conveyed in one of two ways—first, as a vivid picture affecting the focus and
retina of the eye, perfect in its outline and coloring, and giving the impression of being either
distant or near or at moderate range. Secondly, it may be conveyed as a vivid impression accom­
panied by a hazy and undefined formation in the crystal field. In this form it becomes an apper­
ception rather than a perception, the consciousness receiving the impression of the vision to be
conveyed before it has had time to form and define itself in the crystal.
The direct vision is more generally found in association with the passive type of seer. It is
not usually so regular and constant as the symbolic vision, owing to the peculiarities of the nega­
tive temperament. When it does appear, however, it is particularly lucid and actual, and has its
literal fulfillment in the world of experience and fact. It is an actual representation of- past or
future event, or yet of what is then presently happening at some place more or less distant.
The symbolical vision is more closely associated with the positive temperament. It has the
advantage of being more ready and constant in its manifestations than the direct vision, while on
th© other hand it is frequently a matter of speculation as to what the symbolic vision may portend.
The positive temperament, centripetal and forceful in its action, appears to throw off the
soul-images, afterward going out toward them in a mood of speculative inquiry. The passive tem­
perament, however, centrifugal and sensitive, most frequently feels first and sees afterward, the
visionary process’ being wholly devoid of speculation or mental activity. The one sees and thinks,
the other feels and sees. That, in a word, is the distinction between the two temperaments.
In the early stages of development the crystal will begin to cloud over, first becoming dull, then
suffused with milky clouds, among which sparkle a large number of little specks of light like gold
dust in the sunlight. The focus of the eyes is inconstant, the pupil rapidly expanding and con­
tracting, the crystal at times disappearing entirely in a haze or film which seems to pass before
the eyes. Then the haze will disappear, and the crystal will loom up into full view again, accom­
panied by a lapse of the seer into full consciousness. This may be the only experience of the
first few sittings, it may be that of many; but, sooner or later, there,will come a moment when
the milky clouds and dancing starlights will suddenly vanish—a bright azure expanse like an open
summer sky will occupy the field of vision ; the brain will take up a spasmodic action, as if opening
and shutting in the superior coronal region ; there will be a tightening of the scalp on a level with
the base of the brain, as if the floor of the cerebrum were contracting; the seer will catch his
breath with a spasmodic sigh, and the first vision will stand out, clear and lifelike, against the azure
screen of heaven.
The danger at this supreme moment is that the seer will be surprised into full waking con­
sciousness. During the process of abstraction which precedes every vision or series of visions,
the consciousness of the seer is gradually and imperceptibly withdrawn from his surroundings.
He forgets that he is seated in this or that room, that such a person is at his right hand, such
another at his left. He forgets that he is gazing into the crystal. He hears nothing, sees nothing,
save what is parsing before the eyes of his soul. He loses sight, for the time, even of his own
identity.
Therefore, *when his vision is suddenly arrested by an apparition, startling in its reality and
instantaneous production, even though hoped for and expected, the reaction is so violent and rapid
that the seer is frequently carried back into the full consciousness of his physical conditions.
Therefore, the qualifications* of self-possession and confidence in one’s own soul-faculties have
been stated as of primary importance in this domain of research. Excess of joy or fear at sight of
the vision will be fatal to its continuance and to the condition of mind required for the process of
development. This fact must therefore be borne in mind.
DIFFICULTIES
UNDER this head I propose to cite a few of the obstacles to be met with in the process of
inducing the psychic vision, and some also which may be expected in connection with the faculty
when induced.
Putting aside the greatest of all obstacles—that of constitutional unfitness—as having been
already discussed on the preceding pages, the first obstacle to be avoided is that of ill-health.
The importance of a moderate and sustaining diet in regard to psychic development cannot be too
trongly urged. All overloading of the stomach with indigestible food and addiction to alcoholic
■inks tends to cloud the spiritual perception It depletes the brain-centers, gives the heart too
work, and overthrows the equilibrium of the system. Ill-health follows ; the mind is centered
'he suffering body, spiritual aspiration ceases, and the soul folds its wings and falls into
of oblivion. The consciousness of man works from a center, which co-ordinates and
\the phenomena of thought, feeling, and volition. This center of consciousness is capable
dacement. alternating between the most external of our bodily functions and the most
^spiritual operations. It cannot be active in all parts of our complex constitution at

one and the same moment. Hence it follows that when one part of our nature is active another
is dormant, as happens in sleeping and waking dream-life being that wherein the center of con­
sciousness hovers between the body and the soul.
With these considerations in mind, it will be obvious to everyone that a condition in which the
consciousness is held in bondage by the infirmities of the body is not one conducive to psychic
development. The constitution need not be robust, but it should at all events be free from dis­
order and pain. Some of the most ethereal natures are associated with a delicate organism, but
while the balance is maintained the soul is free to develop its latent powers.
It is advisable not to sit for crystal reading, or indeed for any order of psychic exercise,
immediately after or before a meal. The body should be at rest, and the mind contented and
tranquil. Again, the attitude of the seer should not be too expectant or over-anxious in regard
to the production of the vision. Let the development take its natural course. Do not force the
young plant in its growth, or it will come to a premature end. Take time, as Nature does. It is
a great work, and much patience is needed. The acorn becomes the sturdy oak only because
Nature is contented with small results, because she can afford to wait and is never in a hurry to
see the result of her operations. And because she is patient and careful in her beginnings, her
works are wonderfully great and complete in their issues. Above all, they endure. Whoever
breathes slowest will live the longest. This is an Eastern saying which voices a fundamental
truth.
The vision is produced. The faculty of clairvoyance has become more or less under the
control of the mind. New difficulties arise, and, of these, two will be conspicuous. The
first is that of time-measure, and the other is that of interpretation. The former is peculiar to
both orders of vision, the direct and the symbolic. The difficulty of interpretation is, of course,
peculiar to the latter order of vision.
Time-measure is, perhaps, the greatest difficulty encountered by the seer. It is sometimes
impossible to determine whether a vision relates to the past, the present, or the future. In most
cases, however, the seer learns by experience how to distinguish, and frequently it will be found
that an intuitive impression of the period involved comes with the vision itself. In our own
experience the foreground, middle distance, and background, mark off the present, the approximate,
and the distant future. In tracing the succession of events, we have found it convenient to think
of time-measure at the outset, bending the sight upon each month or year separately and in suc­
cession, noting the visions that arise with each in order. And as regards the past or future, we
distinguish between them by an Intuitive sense rather than by any other means, and very rarely is
this sense deceived, for it is part of the psychic faculty we have had in training.
Therefore, if the vision appears in the foreground and, as it were, at the feet of the seer,
then it may be taken as relating to the present, or a unite recent date. In the same way the
middle distance indicates the near past or future, and the background denotes the more distant
past or future. The other difficulty we have mentioned is that of interpretation of such symbols
as may arise. The following pages will indicate some of the symbols and their meanings. The
rest must be left to the intuition of the seer.
SYMBOLS
SYMBOLS are thought-forms which convey, by the association of ideas, a definite meaning in
regard to the mind that generates them. They depend wholly upon the laws of thought, and the
correspondence that exists between the spiritual and material worlds, between the subject and
the object of our consciousness.
Among the ancients symbols were the original form of record, of communicating ideas, and of
writing. The hieroglyphs of the Egyptians, the word-pictures of the aborigines of Central America,
the ideographic writing of ancient Mongolia, are all forms of symbolic writing, drawn from natural
objects. The Hebrew alphabet, the names of its 22 letters clearly indicate the nomadic and
simple life of those “dwellers in tents.” Thus the names of the letters include such objects as
ox, tent, tent-door, tent-peg, camel, fish, fish-hook, an eye, a hand, a basket, a rope-coil, a head,
an ox-goad, water, etc. From the combination of these simple forms the words are constructed...
thus the word used to simplify “knowledge” is derived from these letters, Yod, Daleth, Oin, which
mean a hand, a door, an eye. The hand denotes action, power, etc.; the door denotes entering,
initiation, etc.; the eye denotes seeing, vision. Therefore the three ideographs, when combined,
denote “opening the door to see,” which is a very graphic way of conveying the idea of acquiring
knowledge. One cannot help seeing the hand of the young Hebrew drawing aside the canvas door
of the tent and peeping in to see what secrets may be learned!
All symbols, therefore, may be translated by reference to the known nature, quality, and uses
of the objects they represent. Thus a foot signifies a journey, and also understanding; a mouth
denotes speech, revelation; an ear news, information, and, if ugly and distorted, scandal or abuse.
The sun, shining brightly, denotes prosperity, honors. The moon, when crescent, denotes success;
increase, and improvement. When gibbous, it denotes sickness, decadence, losses, and trouble.
The sun eclipsed shows the death or ruin of a man; the moon, similarly afflicted, denotes equal
danger to a woman. These are natural interpretations.
Every symbol, however, has a threefold interpretation, and the nature of the inquiry or the
purpose for which the vision is sought must determine the meaning of the symbols. If they refer
to the spiritual world the interpretation must be agreeable to the nature of the spirit, and similarly
if they refer to the intellectual or physical worlds. Thus a pair of scales would denote Divine
Justice in the spiritual sense, judgment inthe intellectual sense, and obligation in the material
sense. If the scales were evenly balanced the augury would be good. But if weighed down on
one side it is Mene, mene, teki, upharsin, “Thou art weighed and found wanting” ; it shows a cor­
rupt judgment, a wrong conclusion, an unbalanced mind, failure in one’s obligations, injustice, etc.
And if a word should lie across the scalesor be seen overhead, then a speedy judgment will be
meted out
A ship is a symbol of intercourse, of trading, of voyaging, etc. If in full sail it shows that
the communication with the spiritual world is increasing, that news from far-off lands will come
to hand, that trade will increase, that a voyage will be taken. If aught is written on the sails it
will be an additonal source of enlightenment. If the symbol of death be written there, it shows
speedy translation to a far-off country in which the subject will die. That far-off country may be
the spiritual world itself, in which case the death would be a natural one. But if the ship’s sails
are drooping, then it denotes a falling away of spiritual influx, of intelligence, and of trade. Expected
news will not come.
Black bread denotes a famine, and if it be spotted with yellow blotches it shows a plague.
This symbol was seen, with a goat butting at it, in June, 1896. There followed a famine and
plague in India, which country is said to be ruled by the zodiacal sign of Capricorn I The symbol
was not deciphered till the event came to throw light upon it. In the same way a leaf of shamrock,
denoting the Triple Alliance, has been seen split down the center with a black line, denoting the
fracture of the treaty. It would also seem to indicate that Ireland, whose symbol is the sham­
rock, will be separated by an autonomous government from the existing United Kingdom.
In similar manner all symbols arising in the crystal may be interpreted by reference to their
known qualities and uses, as well as the association existing between them and other things, pe
sons, and places, in the mind of the seer. As I have already said, however, the meaning
most of the symbols will be conveyed to the consciousness of the trained seer at the t*
their appearance in the crystal. Experience will correct many errors, and a symb
known, will assume a constant meaning with each seer, so that after, repeated r
it will hold a definite signification.
(Continued on Next} Page)

It should be mentioned, however, that the same symbol will have different meanings with
different seers. It is difficult to say why this is the case. But it probably arises from the
difference of, individual temperament, and the Order to which the soul belongs in the spiritual world.
These dissimilarities exist between individuals down to the lowest of our sensations. We have
the same laws of thought and the same general constitution. Humanity holds us all within the
bonds of a single nature. Yet, despite this fact, we have differences of opinion, of emotion, of
sympathy and antipathy, of taste, and so forth. Therefore it would appear that the soul images
projected by the magical power of the mind must have different signification with each of us, their
interpretation being in some peculiar way in agreement with the nature of the person who sees them.
Necessarily no definite rule can be laid down as to interpretation, but it is advisable that the seer
or seeress should be his or her own interpreter.
Thus, although every symbol has some general signification in agreement with its natural
qualities and uses, yet it obtains a particular signification in regard to each person. It is within
common experience that this is the case in regard to dreams, wherein the faculty of seership is
acting in its normal plane. Every person is a seer in dream-life, but few persons pay that attention
to dreams that their origin and nature warrant. The crystal is but a means of bringing this normal
faculty of dreaming into activity in the waking life. Yet, as stated above, the differences of import
or meaning, even in the dream-world, of any particular symbol is a common experience. Thus one
person will dream to be wading in water whenever there is trouble ahead. Another will dream of
a naked child when similar troubles are about to occur. Butcher’s meat will signify financial
troubles to one person, to another a fortunate speculation. The controlling factor in this matter
is probably to be found in the constitution of the mental and psychic qualities conferred by the
hereditary and psychic influences converging at the conception of an individual, and expressed in
the birth. Probably, too, an argument could be established in regard to the influence of the
planets ruling at the nativity, and also from the dominion of the signs of the zodiac in the
horoscope of birth. But this would be beyond the scope and intention of this short treatise.
SOME EXPERIENCES
THE following facts, in connection with predictions made from the Crystal, have come within
the knowledge of the writer, either as personal experiences or in association with others in whom
the faculty of clear-vision is active.
A lady of title visited the seer in the month of June, 1896, and was told that she would hear
news from abroad in some hot country concerning the birth of a child, a boy, who would arrive
in the following year in the month of February. The lady did hear such news, and in February,
1897, a boy was born to the lady’s sister in India. The same lady was told that on a certain date,
while traveling, she would meet with an accident to the right leg. She fell between the platform
and the footboard while getting into a train, and suffered severe abrasion of the right leg, together
with a serious muscular strain which laid her up for several days. Previous to that the lady
was to- be surprised by some good fortune happening to her son in connection with papers and a
contest. This happened at the time specified. Her son passed his examination for the military
college with honors.
Mrs. H. was consulted by a lady of some ability in a special line of literature. This fact was
hot, however, within the knowledge of the seeress. She was told that she would go up a certain
staircase into a dingy room with a roll of something under her arm. She would see a dark man
who was thick set and of quiet demeanour. The man would take the roll, and it would be a source
of good fortune to her at a later date.
The lady-consultant did so take a certain manuscript rolled up beneath her arm. She went up
the dingy staircase described by the seeress, and saw the man whose description had been given.
The manuscript was transferred from her hand to that of the publisher, for such was the
man’s occupation. The manuscript was accepted, and later on was published. So the prediction
was literally fulfilled.
In the first case cited the vision was symbolical, and the interpretation was made by the
seer himself. In the second case the vision was literal and needed no interpretation. These two
cases will serve for an illustration; of the two types of vision.
Mrs. A. was consulted by a lady of the. writer’s acquaintance in 1893. She was told that she
would not marry the person to whom she was then engaged, but would have to’ wait till a certain
person, who was described, should come from a foreign country and take her away. This would
happen, it was said, in the month of January, three years later. This event transpired in due
course exactly as predicted, though nothing was further from the probable course of events ; in
fact, the lady was not a little irate at the allusion to the breaking off of her then existing relations,
while the idea of marrying a person whom she had never seen, and for whom she could have no
sort of regard, was naturally revolting to one so wholly absorbed as she was at the time.
Mrs. G. consulted the seer on September 27th, 1894. She was told she would have sickness
incidental to the loins and shooting pains in the knees. (A figure was seen with a black cloth
Ground the loins, the figure stooping and resting its hands upon its knees.) She would be the
bwner of a house in the month of December. (A house was seen covered with snow; the trees
frere bare.) A removal would be made when the trees were without leaf. (A bird was seen on
I branch without leaf; the bird flies off.) The consultant would be engaged in a dispute con-
terning money. (Several hands seen grabbing at a pile of money.)
These events came to pass at the time predicted. It is advisable to note that in the first
Instance the symbolical vision is seen; in the second, a literal vision supervenes; and in the third
and fourth cases the vision reverts to the symbolical. Here we have an instance of the over­
lapping of the two conditions of the temperament, the active and the passive states alternating.
As an illustration of the extreme difficulty of interpretation in the normal state of consciousness
a symbol may be cited which was seen in the crystal for Miss X. “A shield, and a lion rampart
thereon, in red.” Now this might mean anything. It suggests the armorial bearings of a princely
family. The lion rampart might mean the anger of a person in authority, as the lion is the avowed
king of beasts. Its color, red, and its attitude are naturally expressive of anger. The shield
might be a protection, though little needed by a lion, especially if the assailant were the fragile
Miss X. to whom the vision had reference.
Now observe the interpretation of the seer. “You will hear news from a man of medium
height and fair complexion concerning a foreign country. A letter will come in reference to some­
thing written by you which will be the very best thing that could happen. You will score a great
success.” This interpretation, which is quite in line with the fact and which afterwards trans­
pired, is probably as far removed from all that one might have expected as anything could well be.
But we have to remember that the condition in which the seer voices the interpretation of symbols
seen by him is a psychological one, and no doubt in that state natural symbols take on quite a
different signification to that which they would hold in the normal state of waking consciousness. How
often do dreams have a marked influence upon the dreamer while still asleep; how often do they
assume proportions of magnitude and become pregnant with meaning to the dreamer, only to
X^dissolve into ridiculous triviality and nonsense as soon as the person awakes! It would indeed
npear that a complete hiatus exists between the visionary and the waking states of conscious-
Ss, so that even the laws of thought undergo a change when the centre of consciousness is
-red from the outer to the inner world of thought and feeling.
writer has known cases of sickness predicted with remarkable accuracy, the time and
of the sickness being foretold with more or less accuracy. The reception of unex-
Ars and telegrams; their import and consequences; the various changes, voyages,
Stations and speculations occurring in the consultants’ lives have been foretold by

means of the crystal. Deaths have been foreseen, and even changes in the religious views of the
consultant or his associates.
In one case the writer saw a vision of a public square in which was the effigy of a lamb
mounted upon a pedestal. The lamb was made of solid silver and was mounted on marble. A
Catholic priest came along and pointed at the lamb. Immediately a flash of lightning came from
the sky and struck the effigy, melting off one of its ears.
This was stated to signify that the community to which the consultant belonged would im­
mediately lose a member by conversion to the Roman Church. By the next mail the consultant
learned that such was the case—an important member of the community having gone over to the
Roman Catholics exactly as predicted.
In another case a man was seen dressed in black and wearing the habit of a judge. He held
some papers in his hands which he was endeavoring to conceal. He appeared unsuccessful in his
efforts. A snake was seen at his feet. It rose up against him. A change took place in the field
of the vision and the same man was seen lying on his death-bed. From this it was predicted
that the man designated by the vision would be guilty of misrepresentation, and would be cut off
by death three years from that time. The prediction was in every respect verified.
Not unfrequently the visionary state is induced by excessive emotion, during which the pro­
phetic faculty is considerably heightened. Some temperaments of a peculiarly sensitive order will
fall into the clairvoyant condition while engaged, in thought. The thread of thought is broken, and
there appears a vision wholly unconnected with the subject but a moment ago in the mind. It would
appear that the soul of the sensitive, while probing the depths of its inner consciousness, suddenly
comes into contact with the thin partition which may be said to divide the outer world of thought
and doubt from the inner world of intuition and direct perception, and, breaking through, emerges
into the light beyond. The same may be said of cases which manifest the faculty of clear visions
while in the hypnotic state, whether spontaneous or induced. The trance condition frequently
manifests this faculty in conjunction with others, such as clairvoyance or clear hearing and
the sense of psychic touch.
The following instance, which was reported in the Morning Reader of Friday, August 14th,
1896, is remarkable for its extreme pertinence to the subject under consideration.
“Last month a man named David Thomas, who had for a short time been employed by Lord
Windsor as his estate carpenter, was found shot dead in a lonely spot on the roadside near Fair­
water, a village not far from Cardiff. No trace of the murderer could be found, and no motive has
been supplied for the fell deed.
“David Thomas was, from all accounts, a quiet, peaceable fellow, well liked by his intimates,
and happy in his domestic relations. He was a native of the little fishing village Aberaevon, in
Cardiganshire, but he had lived in Glamorganshire for some years, and had married a respectable
woman, a native of the Vale of Glamorgan. A few months ago he received the appointment of
carpenter on Lord Windsor’s estate. He then removed with his family to live in the little village of
St. Fagan’s, a few miles out of Cardiff. He had hardly settled down there when the tragedy took
place. It happened on a Saturday night. He had given up work early, and had come home to
cut the grass in the little green in front of his cottage, and to tidy up his new home. Early in the
afternoon he seems to have grown tired of the work and went indoors. His wife asked him to
take the children out for a stroll. He made no reply, and his wife, busy in another part of the
house, did not pay much attention to his subsequent movements. She knows, however, that he
washed and went upstairs to put himself tidy, and then went out—without the children.
“He seems to have met a friend on the road, and went for a walk with him. They called at
a public-house, and had a glass or two of beer. Then, about ten o’clock, they parted. Thomas
was quite cheerful, and started for home at a brisk pace. He came presently to a'lonely part
of the road. A wayfarer heard a pistol shot and a scream, and presently met a man who was
hurrying away from the direction of the scream, and who wished him a gruff goodnight. Two
hundred yards farther on the traveler saw in the dim night the body of a man stretched out on
the side of the road. He fetched assistance: the body was that of David Thomas. He had
been shot about a hundred yards behind, but he had not been killed outright. He had run in terror
up the road, spouting blood as he went, and leaving a ghastly trail behind him.
“But a weird story which is told in the Western Mail of Cardiff serves to lend that touch of
horror to the tale which renders it more thrilling than any story which the most daring novelist
would venture to create.
“ A young girl, who is not yet 20, has been in the habit for some time past of attending
seances held by the Cardiff Psychological Society. One night at a seance, while in a state of
trance, she was seized with a strange convulsion. Through her lips came the words :
“ ‘I—will—have—my—revenge.’
“ ‘Who are you, friend?’ asked the interlocutor.
“ ‘David—Thomas. I—was—shot.’
“This entirely unexpected answer was followed by sensational statements concerning the
murder and the identity of the murderer. Some days after she was taken out to Fairwater—which
she had never before visited—and re-enacted in a trance the scene of the murder.
“The story leaked out, and came to the ears of the Western Mail. Doubts were cast at once
on the bona tides of the girl and the whole story. An offer was made to repeat the experiment
in the presence of two- Mail representatives. The offer was accepted, and one night this week, at
ten o’clock, the little party met outside the Railway Inn where poor David Thomas had had his
last drink.
“A start was made. The medium walked at an easy pace between a male and female friend,
whose arms were linked. The faint outline of the road ahead led always on towards a wall of
blackness.
“At last they came near Fairwater. Suddenly the medium spoke:
“ ‘I see a pistol right in front of me—held towards me—it is a shiny one—there it is, held up—
it has a large mouth.’
“Forty yards farther on the medium spoke again. ‘Hark! I hear footsteps! I see a man!’
“ ‘Where?’
“ ‘Right in front of us. There he is, creeping along the hedge. He is keeping out of sight.*
“‘What is he like? How is he dressed?’
“The medium described her vision very minutely. . Her pace increased suddenly; she dragged
her linked companions on with a lurch forward. The farmhouse where she first saw the phan­
tom stranger was well passed. She was following him, eagerly now.
“A piercing scream came from the girl. A pressman sprang to her side and helped to pre­
vent her body pitching headlong forward.
“This was at the spot where David Thomas fell at the first shot.
“ ‘O—o—oh!’ moaned the medium, twisting her left arm around to the back, to a spot
immediately below the shoulder-blade, as if in intense agony. Then, supported on either side,
she staggered forward.
“A light was struck to see her face. It was the hue of death. Her eyes were turned until
the whites only were visible.
“ ‘Let her go down!’
“Moaning, she was allowed to sink, and lay there prone. Her moans expressed intense agony
and were like those of a man dying, blood gurgling in the sound; it was scarce conceivable
woman actually lay there.
“ ‘Speak, friend,’ said her interlocutor, and presently came the slow answer, a wb’
“ ‘David—T—T—Thomas.’
“ ‘What do you want of us, friend?’
“ ‘J—was—shot!’ The tones of the* voice were those of a man,
(Continued on next page)
THE de LAURENCE COMPANY 541
“ 'Who shot you?’
“A name was given.
“ ‘What do you want to do, my friend?’
“Slowly, distinctly, with relentless purpose came the answer.
“ ‘I—will—have—my revenge. He shot me.’
“Then the medium told them where the pistol had been bought by the murderer a year ago
under an assumed name, and where the pistol would be found. All this while the poor girl lay
prone on the roadside under the thin sinister telegraphic pole.
“Gradually she revived. ‘Look, look!’ she cried, in a voice of horror, ‘Look at the blood.’
“ ‘Where?’
“ ‘Here—look! Look here I’ indicating spots invisible to any one else. ‘Take me away,’ she
shuddered, but before her frightened exclamation could be obeyed her body suddenly stiffened. ‘He
is there!’ she said, with a pitiful"horror in her tone, but with her face expressionless and her eyes
still white.
“ ‘What do you see?’
“ ‘The ghost.’
“Then the party returned, shaken in mind and surfeited with horrors.’’
Examples of a similar nature might be multiplied indefinitely, and would but serve to show what
nas already been stated as a matter of personal experience among all those in whom the psychic
faculties have attained any degree of development, viz., that the rapport existing between the human
soul and the world of subjective consciousness is capable of being actively induced by recourse to
appropriate means, or cultivated, where it exists to any degree, by means of the crystal and other
accessories, such as the metal disc used in China, or the Shivalingam stones used in India.
The following example of the psychic sense of feeling will serve to show that all the senses,
not that of vision alone, are capable of development under suitable conditions. A contributor to the
Westminster Budget, in December, 1893, sends the following account of the use of the divining rod
for the purpose of spring-finding:—
"A few weeks ago took place some operations with the divining rod by Mr. Stears, of Hull, who was called to Mr. S.
Campion’s farm at East Heslerton, near Malton, to search for a water supply. At that time he marked two places near
the farmhouse where, he said, the presence of water was indicated by the rod. Since then Mr. E. Halliday, plumber, of
Malton, has bored an artesian well at one of the places indicated, and found a very copious supply of water at a depth of
87 feet, after going through sand, clay, and a bed of what Mr. Halliday says is quartz and lead ore. Mr. Campion, who
was previously without a supply of pure water, is delighted with the results of the visit of the ‘diviner,’ and has faith in
his power with the rod. Mr. Stears has since been called in to experiment on several farms on the Birdsall estate of
Lord Middleton, the operations being conducted in the presence of Julia, Lady Middleton, the Hon. Geoffrey and Mrs.
Dawney, Mr. Persons (Lord Middleton's agent), and others. Other farms were visited, and Mr. Stears, after employing
the rod, indicated the presence of water at each. Mr. Halliday has also received instructions to make tests at these places,
and operations are now in progress. Mr. Stears has successfully ‘divined’ for water on two of Mr. Lett’s farms in the
East Riding, and also at Amotherby, near Malton; and his success is drawing fresh attention to the ‘divining rod’ and
its capabilities in the hands of a duly ‘inspired’ professor. Mr. Stears claims that he can also discover metals as well as
water, and he alleges that not one person in 10,000 can use the rod successfully. His explanation of the power he possesses
beyond the ordinary run of his fellowmen is that it is what he would call ‘animal electricity,’ because at times, after using
the rod for a long period, he loses his power with it, and only recovers it after a short rest and refreshment. In the presence
of Lady Middleton and the rest of the company he made several interesting experiments—for instance, standing on a china
dish, to show that china is a non-conducting agent (the rod ceasing to oscillate even when over water); finding metals
hid in the ground, etc.”
Mrs. Louise Cotton, writing of the operation itself, says:—
“When a sensitive person who has the power of feeling the existence of water or mineral under the surface of the earth,
steps exactly over the course of a spring or running water, or metallic vein, etc., the piece of wood or other medium used
turns in the hands—-in most cases upwards for water and downwards for minerals. The motion varies according to individual
temperaments: in some hands the turning is slow and but slightly felt, or scarcely perceptible by lookers-on; with others it
rotates rapidly, and when held tightly by the thumb, the bark of the branch or twig often peels off; and, with very
susceptible operators, I have seen the rod fly out of the hands, or, if very tightly held, break.”
As yet, however, the majority of people are wholly oblivious to the fact that such psychic faculties exist, and even those
who possess them, i. e., who have them in something like working efficiency, are conscious of having but an imperfect
control over them.
Probably it is as suggested by Mr. F. H. Myers, these things are, as yet imperfectly understood. Genius, far from
being a condition bordering on neurosis or other nervous ailments—as Lombroso and Nordau have erroneously taught—is an
exaltation of faculty which brings its subject into relations with a plane of life possibly far in advance of one’s normal
experience; so that while new centres of activity are as yet under imperfect control, the normal functions of the brain and
other centres of action are left in neglect. Hence, to the casual observer, the erratic nature of Genius is not distinguishable
from some incipient forms of insanity.
In just the same way the opening up of new centres of activity in the psychic nature of man is frequently attended by
temporary loss of control over the normal brain functions. Loss of memory, hysteria, absent-mindedness, unconscious utterance
of one’s thoughts, illusions and hallucinations, irritability, indifference to one’s surroundings, and similar perversions,
are among the products of the newly-evolved psychic faculty.
These, however, will pass away when the faculty has been brought under control of the mind. Nature is jealous of its
offspring, and concentrates the whole of its forces when in the act of generation. That is the reason of its apparent neglect
of powers and functions already under its control while the evolution of a new faculty is in process.
The would-be seer, therefore, must be prepared to pay the price of any success which may attend his efforts in the
direction of inducing clairvoyance by means of the crystal.
“The universe is thine. Take what thou wilt, but pay the price,” is the mandate of Nature. "What shall be the price
of this new faculty?” the reader may ask. The answer is the same in regard to this or any other faculty of the soul:
“What is it worth to yourself? That Is the price you must pay.’’
With this equation in mind the reader is asked to consider seriously the phenomena indicated in the foregoing pages.
DIRECTIONS FOR USING THE CRYSTALS AND MAGIC MIRRORS
DAYLIGHT or artificial light are both equally suitable. A North light is the best suited to the
human eye.
Observer should sit back to the light, holding the mirror or crystal in the palm of the hand,
which may rest comfortably on the lap, or it can be placed on a table with a stand under it, and a
back screen of black velvet or dark material. The latter materially assists by cutting off side
lights and reflections. Steady gazing in complete silence is absolutely necessary, for unlike other
occult phenomena, the distraction of the attention of primary (ordinary) consciousness is a great
disadvantage. Success depends chiefly upon idiosyncrasy or faculty in the gazers, for “Seers”
are very often men and women of imperfect education, in fact they seem “born rather than made,”
but the faculty may be developed in many people, seemingly at first insensitive, by frequent short
trials, say fifteen to twenty minutes at a time, or less if the eyes get tired.
Success is indicated when the crystal or mirror, ceasing to reflect, becomes milky. A clouded
color following (generally red, and its complementary green), turning to blackness, which seems
to roll away like a curtain, disclosing to the view of the student pictures, scenes, figures in action,
sentences of warnings, advice, etc. etc.
Specially made crystals.—Pure, “translucent,” and will not cause injury to the eye. As safe in
this respect as pure rock crystal (the price of which is enormous, a small one costing $100.00).
These crystals are considered the best. The price a few years ago was $25.00 each, but
sale having become larger and the process less expensive, they are now sent packed with in-
tjons for much less. “Some persons see at once, others after a time. Women see better than
ions of the past, present, and future, on the subjects upon which the mind feels anxious,
^qt require a knowledge of astrology to be able to use the crystal.”

CRYSTAL-GAZING AND SYMBOLS
By L W. de LAURENCE
Fortunately I do not feel called upon to give a scientific explanation
of the phenomenon known as Clairvoyance. The facts are numerous ; the
evidence is unimpeachable ; and the exercise of the faculty is too well
attested the world over to leave any manner of doubt as to its claim to a
place in the category of occult phenomena.
Two facts, however, appear to have been established in regard to it,
viz. : (1) The faculty is not normal to the same degree in all persons ; (2)
in those in whom it is more or less constantly active faculty it is never­
theless beyond the control of the will.
The function of the brain—which may be regarded as the bulbous
root of a nervous plant whose branches grow downwards—is duplex ;
to affect and to be affected. In its active or positive condition it affects
the whole of the nervous arid muscular processes in man, finding ex­
pression in vital action. In its passive or negative condition it is affected
by impressions coming to it through the organs of sense, the results be­
ing expressed by nervous and mental action. It is this latter phase of brain function with which
we are concerned in the study of clairvoyance, whether natural or induced.
The range of our sense-perceptions puts us continually in relations with the material world,
or rather with a certain part of it only. But the gamut of sensation is limited in us. Many insects,
birds and quadrupeds have keener sense organs than we. The photographic plate can register
beyond the highest range of our sense of sight. The X-rays have put us in relations with a
new order of impression-records quite beyond normal sense perception. The animalculae and
microbic life, itself microscopic, have yet their own sense-organs related to a world of life beyond
our ken. We know most positively that Nature does not cease to exist where we cease to per­
ceive her. Yet there are people foolish enough to require the evidence of the senses in proof of
things which cannot normally be perceived and who would scout the idea that visions may be seen in
a crystal unless they could be pointed out and perceived by them.
The relation of our sense-organs to the several degrees of matter, to solids, fluids, gases, etc.,
vary very considerably with different persons. The average wool-sorter would leave many an artist
behind in his discrimination of color-shades. Odors are not only differently sensed by various
individuals, but also they affect people differently.
The perception of sound also affords evidence of a wide range of variability in the acoustic
sense. Neither is it wholly a matter of quantity. Sounds, colors, odors and flavors have a qualitative
value which differs with the individual percipient. Hence arises the variety of “tastes,” of likes and
dislikes observable in a mixed community. The experience is a general one, but the principle in­
volved appears to have escaped recognition simply because it is a psychological and not a material
or physical one. But to come to the practical part of our subject, let us examine first of all what we
understand by the terms Clairvoyance and Crystal-Gazing.
CLAIRVOYANCE OR CLEAR VISION
Clairvoyance or Clear Vision may be natural or induced. Natural clairvoyance is more com­
mon among certain communities than others. It has been stated that the inhabitants of basalt
territory are disposd to natural clairvoyance, which, if true, would certainly lead to the conclusion
that the faculty is normal to man under certain favoring conditions will become active. It is an
established fact that certain sensitive persons are nervously affected by the presence of water,
and this has been utilized by some for the purpose of finding springs and underground currents.
Such persons are known as “Dowsers.” If these are affected by the presence of underground
water it is quite reasonable to suggest that others may be similarily affected by the presence of
basaltic rocks beneath the surface of the land.
Natural clairvoyants, then, may be regarded as those in whom the faculty is more or less per­
sistent. In coming into a locality, they will describe things which have already taken place there as
if they were presently conscious of them, or as if the events were actually taking place before their
eyes. At other times they will describe events which are subsequently enacted. There appears
to be no sense of time attaching to the vision.
Induced clairvoyance is, in effect, nothing more than the faculty of natural clairvoyance
brought into temporary activity by suitable excitation, meditation or development.
The Crystal or Magic Mirror are a ready means of developing clairvoyance where a tendency
to it is known to exist. The Crystal is clear pellucid quartz or beryl, sometimes oval in shape,
but more generally spherical. Baron Reichenbach credited it with highly magnetic qualities capable
of producing, in a suitable subject, a state analogous to the ordinary waking trance of the hypnotists.
Reichenbach has shown, by a series of experiments upon sensitive and hypnotized subjects, that
metals and other substances produced marked effects in contact with the human body. The same
substance was found to affect different patients in diverse manner. The hypnotic experiments of
Dr. Charcot, the well-known French biologist, have also demonstrated the rapport existing be­
tween the sensitive and foreign bodies in contact; as, for instance, when a bottle containing poison
was taken at random from among a number of others and placed on the back of the patient’s neck,
the hypnotized subject would at once develop all the sypmtoms of poisoning by arsenic, strychnine,
prussic acid, etc., it being afterwards ascertained that the bottle thus applied contained the toxine
whose affects had been portrayed by the subject.
It is not, therefore, a matter of surprise that the Crystal, which is a highly “magnetic” body
in the sense that Reichenbach uses the term “odylic,” should produce marked effects upon a certain
order of sensitives. The fact that it does not act similarily upon all subjects seems to indicate that
the difference is not in its action, but in the predisposition of the subject. Where the Crystal does
not answer it is often found that the Black Magic Mirror is effective. Many have prepared a Mirror
of this nature after the directions given in A Message To All Mystics, and the effects have fully
justified the claim that for purposes of clairvoyant development the “Magnetic Mirror” is not to be
surpassed.
A bowl of water has been found effective as a medium in some cases, and we learn that Jacob
Boehme, while engaged in his work as a cobbler, was suddenly entranced by the sight of the sun’s
rays falling on a vessel containing water.
From that time his interior vision was opened, and we have in consequence a number of
Narkable works from an unlettered man, including “the Aurora,” “the Four Complexions,” “the
ura Rerum,” and other works.
to the medium employed for inducing clairvoyance, it cannot be definitely prescribed. It
■in a matter of experiment for each investigator. The degree of sensibility to stimulus
\differs with the subject. There are some in whom the psychic faculties are more
others. In SQrne thes»e powers are hereditary, in others they are developed by an

innate tendency aided by favoring circumstances. In most persons the natural powers take a more
practical turn, making them successful in mundane affairs rather than in those that are psychic and
spiritual. All are not constituted alike, and it is well that it is so. The distribution of natural gifts
proceeds from the celestial world, and is so ordered that each person born on this planet may take
his part in the economy of life. The spiritual needs, of mankind are included in this economy, and
there are born into the world from time to time those who are specially endowed with the faculty
or spiritual interpretation, with psychic gifts such as clairvoyance, telepathy, psychometry, etc.,
such persons being the natural channels of communication between the superior and inferior, or the
internal and external worlds. They are to humanity what a certain order of microbic life is to the
body of man—organic interpreters, translating the elements of food into, blood, nerve, fibre, tissue,
etc., agreeably to the laws of their being. Among any people who are alive to the paramount im­
portance of maintaining the open door between this world and the spiritual universe, such media
are cared Tor and protected and suitable conditions are supplied for the exercise of their faculty.
It was so in the case of the Sybils among the Greeks; it is thus also in India today.
PRELIMINARIES AND PRACTICE
In the practice of Clairvoyance by natural means, patience is very necessary. Admitting that
the germ of the faculty is there. Nature requires not only suitable conditions, but also adequate
time in which to display her powers. Here again we find temperamental differences ; and it may be
useful in this place to indicate by what means and by what persons seership may most readily be
attained.
In regard to the subject, medium or seer, there are two distinct temperaments in which the
faculty may be expected to develop very readily. There is the nervous temperament associated
with a high muscular development, classified as the “mental motive” temperament. It is character­
ized by great activity of body and mind, a certain nervous tension and excitability, prominent
features, full osseous development, prominent brows, intent gaze, and sallow complexion. Mr.
Evan Roberts, who figured so prominently in the Welsh Revival of 1905, is a characteristic example
of this class of subjects.
The other class in whom the passive temperament is present and to whom visions come by
reflections as images mirrored in a moveless lake, are known by the following characteristics ;
full and lymphatic habit, pale or delicate complexion, blue eyes, straight fine hair, small, plump
and cold hands, and a languid disposition.
There are many variants from these two main types, of course, but they are cited as being
very distinctive, and also they obtain their development by quite opposite means.
The positive seer studies earnestly and works with effort, throwing out the soul-images by
the power of the will, perceiving them with more or less accuracy, and thereafter turning them
over in the mind, reasoning and questioning concerning their import and meaning.
The passive seer, on the contrary, works not at all and makes no effort, the visions coining
imperceptibly, almost unconsciously, and having generally a literal interpretation or fulfillment.
In the case of the positive seer the visions are symbolical and seldom capable of a literal appli­
cation, even though they may be found to have a material fulfillment. With the passive seer it is
otherwise, the visions being actual visions of what has happened or will thereafter transpire.
Of these two kinds of seership the passive is the more serviceable because more persnlcuous,
but it has the disadvantage of being largely under the control of external Influences, and so fre­
quently incapable of being exercised at will.
The positive type of seer exercise an introspective vision, searching inwardly towards the soul­
world whence revelation proceeds. The passive seer, on the contrary, remains in statu quo, open
to impressions coming inwards towards the perceptive faculty, but making no effort towards
them. The success of each depends upon being allowed the free and uninterrupted exercise of that
method which is natural to their respective temperaments.
In practice it is necessary that self-possession and confidence in one’s own soul-power should
be maintained. Faith is the firm rock upon which all revelation must rest. Let the intention be
pure and a desire for Truth constantly present in the mind. Clairvoyance is not an undisputed
possession, but a gift of the Spirit, and accepted as such in a spirit of humble recognition it is more
capable of proving a real and lasting blessing than that “terror of the soul” it is sometimes seen
to be. And if under the best conditions the quest is unsuccessful after a prolonged period of
earnest trial, it must be taken as sufficient evidence that the faculty of Clairvoyance is not in the
category of one’s individual powers. Possibly the same qualifications brought to bear along some
other line of psychic development will result in a commensurate degree of success.
So far, then, in regard to the preliminaries. A word or two now as to practice.
Having obtained a good rock crystal (the cheap glass balls sold as such by many are quite
useless) or a Black Magic Mirror with a base of bitumen, the same should be kept out of the Sun's
direct rays, and when not in use may be conveniently kept in a black velvet or silk bag, which will
not scratch the surface.
It must not be thought that the visions are in the crystal or mirror itself. They are in the
subconscious mind or soul of the seer ; but the mirror serves as a medium for visualizing the im­
pressions which come up before the .mind’s eye, and also produce inhibition of the basilar portion of
the brain through the optic thalami, tnus placing the attentive mind in a passive condition. Etheric
perturbation caused by combustion disturbs the odylic substance, and therefore no direct rays of
light should be allowed to fall on the mirror. The diffused light just after sunset is the best for
purposing and seering, and the position of the seer should be facing west with the direct light on
the back of the mirror and only reflected rays upon its surface.
If by artificial light, the invocation candles or lamp should be behind the mirror, the latter
being between the light and the seer.
HOW TO PROCEED
The Crystal or Mirror must be in contact with the sitter, and no other person should be within
arm’s length.
A person seated behind the seer may act as prompter or director of the seance, and another
similarly placed may act as recorder.
The Director will maintain an even and quiet tone, suggesting from time to time, what may be
looked for. Thus :—
Director. There is a house in Whitehall street I it is No. 432. You will enter by a gate and go
along a short pathway to the door, which is of brown color. You will go through the door and alor
the vestibule. Turn into the room on the left. Now tell me wh® and what you see there.
The direction should be made by easy stages, and no step should be taken until the see-
firms the previous direction by saying, “Yes, I am there,” or similar form of assent. The
will then know how the seer is progressing. The “push-off” is very necessary in the e?’
of development, and the above suggestion will be found extremely useful.
(Continued on next page)
THE de LAURENCE COMPANY 545
When once the seer is “on the move,” so to speak, he can be left to himself and will then either
recoil at once to a complete consciousness of his physical surroundings or will go on to the exercise
of the clairvoyant faculty.
The Recorder will make notes of everything that is said during the seance; and the results
should be tested and proved so that imagination may not pass for clairvoyance, as it is apt to do
before the faculty is really developed.
At no time during the seance should the director lose psychic of the seer, but as soon as a
direction is satisfied another should be given with, as far as possible, a connecting link, so that the
transitions are rendered natural and not abrupt. Sudden dislocations are apt to break the spell
under which the seer is carried away.
No seance should last more than fifteen minutes, and sittings should be made at the same time
of day and in the same place repeatedly, so that a cumulative effect is produced. A psychic habit is
induced by this means, and it is extremely valuable in all functions of an automatic nature. Anyone
can use a Crystal or Mirror alone if they wish, as many do with marvelous results.
Visions when fully developed are of two kinds, Direct and Symbolic. In most cases it will be
found that answers to detached questions take a symbolic form Passive seers usually have direct
visions, and positive seers favor the symbolic form. The former feels first, and then sees; the
latter first sees, and then thinks.
Special attention must be given in the early stages to the important process of direction. Dur­
ing the process of abstraction which precedes every vision, the consciousness is gradually with­
drawn from the physical surroundings. The seer forgets that he is in this or that place, or in the
presence of this or that person. He forgets that he is gazing into the Mirror or Crystal. He
hears nothing consciously and sees nothing save that which is passing before the eyes of his soul.
For the time being he loses sight of Ids own Identity. When, therefore, the soul is suddenly arrested
by an apparition which it has not consciously evoked, the reaction is apt to be violent and fre­
quently carries the seer back to his normal condition.
The process of direction, however, if properly conducted, tends to establish a condition of
preparedness in the seer, or Crystal Gazer, which is decidedly beneficial.
If there is a suspicion of telepathic communication between the seer or Mirror Gazer and the
director or recorder, it can be obviated by directing the seer to a point where the knowledge of
those present at the seance is equally nil All independent intelligence communicated by the seer can
be subsequently checked and tested.
VISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS
The passive or direct vision is presumably a representation of the actual state of things
perceived, whether relating to the past, present, or future. The circumstantial account given by the
seer is sufficient to indicate that it is a direct vision.
The symbolic vision is, however, fraught with many difficulties for those who are unacquainted
with symbolism and the method of interpretation. Something, therefore, may be said on this point.
Symbols are thoughtforms which convey, by the association of ideas, a definite meaning to the mind
which perceives them. They depend entirely upon the Laws of Thought and the correspondence
between the spiritual and material worlds, between the subject and object of our consciousness.
These things are fully explained in The Mystic Test Book listed on another page.
SYMBOLS AND THEIR MEANING
Among the ancients, symbols were the original form of record, of communication, and of writ­
ing. The Hieroglyphics of the Egyptians, the word-pictures of the Mayas of Central America, the
ideo-graphic writing of the Chinese are all forms of symbolism derived from natural objects. The
Hebrew alphabet is quite symbolical. Any letter speaks to us of the nomadic people who were
"dwellers in tents.” Such names as ox, tent, tent-door, tent-peg, camel, fish, fish-hook, eye, hand,
basket, rope-coil, ox-goad, water, are names of letters which cannot fail to convey an idea of the
primitive Semites. They are all names of natural objects, and they are all symbols. Bring together
the letters god (hand), daleth (tent-door) and oin (eye), and you have the word yedo. The hand
denotes action, power ; the door, and entry, initiation; the eye, sight, perception,—literally, opening
the door to see: ideographically, knowledge.
Similarly, in Chinese the words for wall, face, and man, when brought together as a symbol,
indicate a wall-facing man, by which we understand a prejudiced and bigoted person, one who will
not see or enlarge his horizon.
AU symbols may be interpreted by their known natures, quaUties and uses. Thus an arm will
signify defence, power, protection; a mouth speech, revelation; and ear news, information; if
distorted, scandal, abuse. The sun prosperity, fife, honors; the moon crescent, prosperity, in­
crease, improvement; when gibbous, loss, decay, decline. The sun eclipsed, death of a man; the
moon eclipsed, death of a woman; bread, food, sustenance, knowledge, preservation; and these
are aU natural interpretations. Every symbol has reference to the Three Worlds, the physical,
intellectual, and spiritual, he. to Nature, Man, and Spirit.
If the question be concerning the material world, a ship as a symbol would show commerce,
trade, a voyage, good or bad according to the condition of the ship; as if in full sail under a clear
sky, prosperity is signified; if in distress or with flagging sails, an unfortunate condition is signified.
If the question has relation to the intellectual world, the same symbol would denote the
interchange of ideas, good or bad news, etc.; if to the superior world, the same symbol would denote
that communication with the spiritual world is increasing or decreasing, as the symbol may in­
dicate. A private ship might thus refer to plunder, slander, infringement of rights, or death.
Symbols are almost infinite in number, and the interpretation of them requires unprejudiced
skill, but they are nevertheless an important subject for study, and the use of the Crystal or
Mirror by a positive seer or student can hardly be beneficial without a profound understanding of
this subject such as is taught in The Great Book Of Magical Art, Hindu Magic And East Indian
Occultism listed on another page.
Although every symbol has some general signification in agreement with its natural qualities and
uses, yet it obtains a particular meaning in relation to the individual. This is also the case in
dreams, where every person is a natural seer. Few, however, pay that attention to dreams which
their source and nature warrant. The Crystal is but a means of bringing the normal dreaming
faculty into conscious activity.
No definite rule can be laid down as to the interpretation of visions, and the seer or seeress
will be found the best interpreter. Yet the difference of meaning, whether in dreaming or visions,
v>f any particular symbol is of common experience. Thus to dream of a naked child imports trouble
some people, while others have a standard dream of wading in water whenever trouble is to be
d. To dream of butcher’s meat means financial troubles to some people, while to others it
's(S gain by speculation.
.controlling factor in this matter is probably to be found in the constitution of the psychic
’.faculties of the seer as express in the nativity. A great deal may be said for a system
'tion that has. for its basis the dominion of the signs of the Zodiac at the birth of an
also the horary positions of these signs at the time of the visions or dreams as the
Crystal Gazing In The Orient
It is claimed by those who have traveled in the Orient that the Hindu can, by the use
of the Crystal or the aid of the Magic Mirror, tell one’s life from the cradle to the
grave; he can, so it is claimed by those who are familiar with his powers, by the use and
aid of these mediums, indicate remedies for the sick, and also perform many marvelous,
interesting and mysterious things; the very same being both good and evil.
Indeed, it is claimed that those who have personally tested the old Hindu Philosophers
that they really do possess wonderful Spiritual Powers gained by the constant use of
a Gazing Crystal and the aid of a Black Magic Mirror, which are their constant com­
panions and helpmates.
From what is claimed, by those who have been brought in personal contact with the
Adepts of the Orient, their Astral and Psychic Sight, as well as their Intuition, like
Ancient and Modern Mystics is developed and perfected by the continuous use of e;'
a Gazing Crystal, or Magic Mirror, or both; therefore, a Mystic or real Adept wc
in no better shape to carry on Occult or Spiritual work without these things th-
a man who tried to write without ink on his pen.
