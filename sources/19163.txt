well you know one of the things that
Carol Rosen but also four-star general
Wesley Clark remarked on is that they&#39;ve
seen documents of this long-term
Strategic Defense plan
and they saw in the names of countries
back in the 70s and 80s that they didn&#39;t
even think were even on anyone&#39;s radar
that were slated to be invaded and to
create Wars in
let&#39;s look at what happened 9 11
happened 20 years ago and we go into
Iraq
under completely hoaxed
evidence very difficult decision for us
to make no item received more attention
but was of Greater concern to us
than the possibility that the Iraqi
Armed Forces might use unconventional
weapons or as they are also known
weapons of mass destruction
Colin Powell&#39;s Chief of Staff has gone
on the record saying that it&#39;s the
biggest mistake of their life that it
turned out that they were set up to go
up to the U.N and present all these
weapons of mass destruction but who
benefited from that the defense
contractors there are no bid contracts
for 150 a gallon for water or fuel to
the front line so the forward operating
basis you have to ask the question who
benefits people who want to control the
population through fear which is leads
to war and people who want to get a lot
of money from Contracting
is a very lucrative the war profiteers
and the big
trillions of dollars I mean we&#39;re
spending nearly a trillion a year now
um defense intelligence Homeland
Security all this United States and if
you have a budget that big
there&#39;s a 20 slush amount
so a trillion a couple hundred billion
can go into black projects nobody knows
what the hell&#39;s going on
that&#39;s the Frankenstein that got created
in the post-world War II era that then
got up off the table and is you know and
is stalking the planet so that&#39;s what
people have to view it it really got out
of control and it&#39;s been out of control
certainly since the Eisenhower time
