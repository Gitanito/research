I was screaming very loudly.  When the emergency services took me to the hospital, they gave me shot after shot of painkillers, but my pain didn't go away. I was screaming as if I was crazy.  The nurse mentioned that she had never ever heard somebody screaming like that. (My ex-boyfriend told me about it later).  After six or seven shots of painkiller, I left my body.

I was in the corner by the ceiling and watching my body lying on the bed and my boyfriend was sitting next to me. I felt profound joy and peace.  I flew closer to my body and thought that I looked very pretty and young.

When my boyfriend started to shake me, I returned to my body.
