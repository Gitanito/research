I wasn't actually walking, I was just moving. Then the door opened and out stepped my deceased second husband and my deceased oldest son, I was not afraid, I realized where I was, but was not scared. I have never felt more at ease or serene. Both my husband and my son told me that it was not my time yet. I didn't want to go back, but not for any other reason, but because I didn't want to feel the pain, that I knew I would feel. Steven (my husband) said that I wouldn't remember the pain. As he held me, I knew, for the first time, he was not lying to me. David (my son) said that I had more to do here on Earth. I remember, seeing a bright, brilliant light, like the Aurora Borealis, over the top of the opening they came out of. I got the feeling that if I had gone through the door, I wouldn't be coming back, but I still was not afraid. I have never felt so loved, at peace, or safe.

Background Information:

Gender:	 Female

Date NDE Occurred:	  January, 8, 1992

  NDE Elements:

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Yes         I was in a serious car accident, at which, they tell me I was dead, but the emergency medical technicians brought me back at the scene. Then the doctors had to jump-start my heart a number of times while I was in Trauma room. Even the doctors said I was gone a few times during the seven hours they fought to save me. All this left me in a coma for twenty-two days.

Did you feel separated from your body?    No

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?       Cannot remember anything else about the accident or even the next twenty-two days. My mother told me that when I came around, I motioned I wanted to write -- I could not talk. The first thing I wrote was that I had seen and held both David and Steven.

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?       Yes     It was just a passageway, which ended sort of at some kind of opening, maybe, a big door.

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?       Yes     See main narrative.

Did you see an unearthly light?       Yes   A lot like the lights of the Aurora Borealis above Alaska. Absolutely beautiful, serene colors.

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?       A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     See main narrative.

What emotions did you feel during the experience?       Serenity, peace, happiness, immense amount of love. Sad when I had to come back.

Did scenes from your past come back to you?       My past flashed before me, out of my control

Did scenes from the future come to you?       No

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       Yes     Everyone who knows me knows that I did a complete three hundred and sixty degree turn, as far as how my life was going. I gave up the drug and alcohol life style I had been in for the last thirty years. I gave up those people who I associated with because I no longer wanted or needed that life; God had given me a second chance at life.  

     After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      Yes   I found it hard to find the right words to express how I felt, completely.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       No

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        The best was finding out that when it is my time, I won't be making the journey alone. The worst was leaving the two people I dearly loved behind.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    My parents do not believe me, neither does my youngest son, they are not sure. Others look at me with disbelief as well.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       I feel that in his own way, God answered a few of my fears that night. Now, I am not afraid to die, but most importantly, I am not afraid to live, finally. God is back in my life now and I am grateful.
