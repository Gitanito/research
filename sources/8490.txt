  	According to our revered Guru Maharaj (left his body in 1961 north India) :   	&quot;Sufism is a way of life. It is neither a religion nor a philosophy. There   	are Hindu Sufis, Muslim Sufis, Christian Sufis '       	My revered Guru was   	a Muslim Sufi&nbsp; , He belongs to the naqshabandiya Hindu branch of Sufism,   	this path has been taken to the west by the Russian woman Irena Tweedie   	................I hope this introduction will give a general idea.!!!!!!
  &nbsp;     	Sufi is a name   	given to a band of mystics who are lovers of God. There is an ancient story   	about a group of lovers who were called &quot;Kamal Posh&quot; (blanket wearers),   	thought by some to be early Sufis.&nbsp; Their only individual possessions   	were their single blankets, which they wore during the day and wrapped   	around themselves at night. They went to every prophet. No one could satisfy   	them. Every prophet told them, do this or that, and they were not satisfied.   	One day Mohammed said that Kamal Posh men were coming and that they would   	arrive in so many days. They came on the day he said and, when they were   	with him, he only looked at them without speaking. They were completely   	satisfied. Why were they completely satisfied? Because he created love in   	their hearts. &quot;When love is created what dissatisfaction can there be?&quot; (2)
  &nbsp;     	Sufism is the   	ancient wisdom of the heart. It is not limited by form, by time or place. It   	always was and it always will be. There will always be those who need to   	realize God as the Beloved. There will always be lovers of God. The Kamal   	Posh recognized that Mohammed knew the silent mysteries of love. They stayed   	with him and became assimilated into Islam.
  &nbsp;     	Islam literally   	means &quot;surrender&quot; and, while the esoteric side of Islam teaches the outer   	religious law of surrender to God, there developed an inner esoteric side   	which teaches of the lover's surrender to the Beloved. A century after the   	death of the Prophet, small groups known as &quot;Lovers of God&quot; began to emerge   	throughout the Muslim world. They were also known as &quot;Travellers&quot; or   	&quot;Wayfarers on the Mystical path,&quot; reflecting a saying ascribed to the   	Prophet:
  &nbsp;     	  		Be in this   		world as if you are a traveller, a passer-by, with your clothes and   		shoes full of dust. Sometimes you sit under the shade of a tree,   		sometimes you walk in the desert. Be always a passer-by, for this is not   		home.       	Later these   	&quot;Wayfarers&quot; became known as Sufis, possibly referring to their white woollen   	garments (s'f), or as an indication of their purity of heart (saf').&nbsp;   	These small groups of Sufis gathered around their teacher, or sheikh.   	The inner teachings of the path are transmitted from teacher to disciple.   	Each teacher guides his disciples according to the principles he has   	received from his teacher. The essence of the teaching is not verbal, but a   	direct communion from heart to heart. The Kamal Posh stayed with   	Mohammed because he created love in their hearts, and it is the inner   	communion of the heart that is the core of the Sufi path. The relationship   	of lover and Beloved is reflected in the relationship with the teacher who   	guides his disciples, or murshids, with an openness of heart and an   	understanding of the mysteries of love. 
  &nbsp;     	At the core of all   	Sufi practices is the element of love and devotion. Devotion is the inner   	attitude of the lover, and the nature of the Sufi path is devotional. The   	Sufi aspires to giveherself to God as a lover to her Beloved. Devotion is an   	opening of the heart to the grace that flows through love. It is an attitude   	of surrender in which the ego and the mind are surrendered to a mystery   	beyond their comprehension. In giving ourselves to God we allow Him to take   	us Home, and the quickest way is through the door of love. In the words of   	al-Qushayri, &quot;The inner reality of love means that you give all of yourself   	to the One until nothing remains of you for you.&quot;    	(3)
  &nbsp;     	It is said that   	there are two ways of attracting God's attention. Either we make ourselves   	perfect and then He has to love us, or we give our self to Him and then He   	cannot resist our need to be with Him. The attitude of devotion is an   	offering of our whole self to Him whom we love. This inner offering is a   	dynamic state of surrender which attracts the higher energies of love. Just   	as in nature a vacuum is always filled, so is the inner emptiness of   	surrender filled with His presence.
  &nbsp;     	&nbsp;Surrender creates   	an empty space within the psyche which allows us to experience the power of   	the Self without being overwhelmed or inflated. Sufi practices are designed   	to help us to surrender, and to realize that we are contained by something   	far beyond the limited horizons of the mind and ego. Stepping into the inner   	spaces of our own being we are able to experience the potency of His love   	for His servant.     	Sufism has explored   	the ways of love and developed means to help the seeker travel this   	invisible and yet powerful path. Because the purpose of the path is to   	reveal the inner essence of the wayfarer, Sufism stays attuned to humanity.   	The deepest nature of mankind remains the same and yet surface changes take   	place. It is said that Sufism has stayed alive and preserved its dynamism   	through adapting and changing with the times and yet at the same time   	remaining true to the essence of the tradition. The essence of the tradition   	is the inner alignment of the heart towards God, and the surrender of the   	ego that allows His will to be done. But outwardly, as society and culture   	develop and change, so does Sufism respond to these changes.

I hope you   	have got an idea about sufism .....all the paths lead to freedom&nbsp; !!!     &nbsp;    	  	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   	warmely&nbsp; !     	  	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Samir       </body>
