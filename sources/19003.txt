you
my name is dr. Eugene mallove I&#39;m
currently the editor in chief of the
International Science and Energy
magazine called infinite energy
published in New Hampshire but now in 38
countries also I&#39;m the director of the
new energy research laboratory which is
part of infinite energy magazine the
actual corporation in the state of New
Hampshire right near Concord is called
cold fusion technology incorporated
magazine has been in existence since
1995 I have two engineering degrees from
MIT a Bachelor of Science in
aeronautical astronautical engineering
in 1969 I have a master&#39;s degree from
MIT also in aeronautical astronautical
engineering 1970 I also have a doctorate
SCD Doctorate and engineering from
Harvard University School of Public
Health and Environmental Health Sciences
1975
I was the chief science writer at the
MIT News office when the cold fusion
story out of Utah broke on March 23rd
1989 and I was at MIT my alma mater as
serving proudly as the chief science
writer in the news office I encountered
cold fusion and my entry into what might
be called today or is called today the
new energy area because I was the chief
science writer at the MIT news office
and it was essential at the time when
doctors pons and Fleischmann on March
23rd made their announcement at the
University of Utah that they had created
apparently a source of energy they said
that had more energy coming out than in
in a jar vessel of heavy water which
they had taken careful measurements they
thought that the amount of heat coming
out was so large that it had to be a
nuclear source they were excellent
chemists world-class they could not see
anything else but a nuclear explanation
even though they didn&#39;t have proof of it
other than the magnitude of the excess
heat and some preliminary indications of
nuclear products that&#39;s how it began and
by the way it&#39;s always nice to mention
that this was only 12 hours before the
Exxon Valdez ran aground off Alaska a
kind of a cosmic coincidence of great
significance in some respect
history will Accord that I&#39;m sure what
we really had was a threat to the
scientific establishment even if it were
perceived as it was then and even today
as a bogus discovery not a real
discovery not a not good science bad
science false data even though that was
and is on the minds of the hot fusion
physicists today and high-energy
physicists the threat of it even being
implied as real and having monies shall
we say being diverted from their
favoured programs and that was a threat
no question it was an actual threat of
that happening it was real
overwhelmingly compelling as I said in
fire from ice
it was real now it&#39;s a hundred percent
certain in fact what pons and
Fleischmann found was only the tip of an
ice
and this is a huge controversy one of
the largest maybe most intense
controversies in the history of science
in the sense that it&#39;s occurring in the
modern age well documented in video and
print media books and everything huge
quantities of technical literature
published by the proponents a much
smaller amount by the people who found
so-called negative results and the
intensity of this controversy certainly
equals controversies of the past like
the Galileo Predaking Revolution two
very dramatic events occurred at MIT
while the cold fusion story was evolving
remember March 23rd 1989 the
announcement but within weeks the hot
fusion people were going into action
behind closed doors to disprove them I
inadvertently was looking through some
piles of paper that had been given to me
in a casual manner by all these hot
fusion physicists as they were trying to
do their calorimetric repeat of the pons
Fleischmann experiment and to my utter
astonishment I can remember sitting at
my desk in my study and actually seeing
these two sheets of paper the wads of
paper reports one dated July 10th 1989
and another dated July 13th three days
apart the difference between July 10th
and 13th was dramatic and my initial
reaction was oh here&#39;s enjoy tenth
control experiment light water heavy
water the real conservation experiment
showing in the raw data excess heat what
looked like excess heat on the graph how
whether it was correct or not is not
important but it looked on the graph
like oh gee that&#39;s dominantly positive
one would conclude from that data alone
gee if we get that on the experiment
that&#39;s exciting okay but then on the
13th
it was shifted completely it was altered
they did some standard averaging which
was appropriate that is in time blocks
but the level of the signal had been
utterly changed and I was stunned I
couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing it
looked like monkey business to me at the
time and it has turned out to be exactly
that it was a lower echelon person
in the plasma fusion center at MIT one
of the 16 authors of a scientific paper
done under department of energy contract
that had altered data and that data is
scientific fraud as far as I&#39;m concerned
and many other people are concerned it
was represented as a negative result
when it was positive didn&#39;t prove coal
fusion even if it the positive result
was a legitimate positive but the
representation of the altered data as a
negative was clear fraud no question
it&#39;s been referred to legal authorities
in the government I asked for a review
at MIT got nowhere if this type of
manipulation had occurred in any
legitimate research area such as cancer
research AIDS research
global warming research anything that&#39;s
accepted is reasonable to be researching
and this kind of shifting were
determined in a normal university
setting the people would lose their jobs
they wouldn&#39;t be in science and yet
these people today their data is used
today to year 2000 and all before to
reject patents it&#39;s not the only thing
they used to reject patents of American
citizens and other people applying for
cold fusion patents but the MIT data is
held up Caltech data is held up Harwell
laboratory in england data held up but
it&#39;s a travesty a very amazing thing we
know for a fact today that the cold
fusion low energy nuclear reactions are
real it&#39;s a class of reactions of
nuclear nuclear non
reactions producing dominantly heat but
also nuclear changes very beneficial
type of powerful reaction that is a
commercially emerging technology in the
hands of a number of companies it&#39;s
difficult technology but it will under
the proper circumstances of proper
patenting and money and what have you it
will emerge as a universal energy source
and I just want to say that at least one
of the reactions is indeed cold fusion
literally the joining of two heavy
hydrogen nuclei to form helium 4 this
has been demonstrated repeatedly a case
dr. les case MIT graduate his process
has been repeated at SR I international
there is absolutely no doubt about this
and what that means is that in one cubic
kilometer of ocean if you fuse all the
heavy hydrogen which is just one sixty
five hundredths of that cubic kill&#39;em
here of ocean that would equal the oil
energy of combusting all the known oil
reserves on earth so for all practical
purposes we know today scientifically in
a very careful manner supported by a
mountain of additional supporting
evidence that that at least is possible
in principle and nearing commercial
application
I believe that coal fusion has opened my
eyes to yet other possibilities
it definitely has opened my eyes to
other possibilities and these
possibilities have now essentially come
to become in my mind based on my
evaluation of a number of devices I have
seen or inferred or studied without
getting into details of what these
devices are in a few instances I can say
there are clearly overunity
electromagnetic devices things that
produce more electrical energy out than
in we are not in Kansas any longer this
is spectacular new physics it indicates
that some rather dramatic cracks exist
in the foundations of physics
electromagnetic Theory required will
require radical revision there has been
an there has been an extraordinary
abrogation of basic legal responsibility
at the Patent Office as an example and
at the Department of Energy on the
matter of cold fusion
cold fusion patents have not been
approved okay the only way of approving
any patent that resembles cold fusion is
to eliminate the words cold fusion or
anything like it
certain people have done that and
succeeded okay the Paterson Power Cell
was one such example and it was an age
Clause acceleration because of the age
of dr. Patterson that helped him and it
was through a different art group at the
Patent Office that helped him also
but dominantly if the patent goes
through a certain gentleman at the
patent office today whose name is Harvey
he will reject all such patents they
will not get through American citizens
of being denied their constitutional
rights in this particular case there is
no question about it we have a complete
audit trail on that numerous inventors
can show us the sheaves of press really
not press releases and newspaper clips
from 1989 showing the failure to produce
reliable results and that&#39;s supposedly
disproving pons and Fleischmann
therefore the inventor is being rejected
on the basis of newspaper accounts also
the MIT negative experiment so called
negative experiment is introduced no
matter what affidavits as to its
invalidity are are put forward for
courts and so forth yes there is serious
criminal activity going on that
ultimately must be rooted out if the
ColdFusion new energy revolution at
least as far as hydrogen energy that is
advanced hydrogen anomalous physics
energy is concerned if it doesn&#39;t get
routed out you will not be able to have
a commercial infrastructure the field of
coal fusion has been marginalized by the
establishment by creating certain myths
about it the pejorative terminology
being used which is highly inappropriate
has not no bearing at all on what&#39;s
being done called pathological science
junk science weird science voodoo
science and I was coming up from a
certain individual at the University of
Maryland and it&#39;s just basically
name-calling they no longer look at the
data of course they never really looked
at the data they had a bad frame of
reference to begin with they said it
must work like hot fusion well this was
in a solid state it&#39;s just like saying
the equivalent of demanding that cold
fusion works like hot fusion
is like saying a transistor works like a
radio tube it&#39;s idiotic
it&#39;s stupid it makes no sense and yet
that&#39;s what was demanded so they made
straw man there must be this product or
this radiation or we&#39;re not going to
believe it
there are prominent coal fusion critics
who have established a very strong
position they have put their foot in
their mouth so to speak and they find it
very difficult if not impossible to
adjust their thinking they can&#39;t admit
they were wrong perhaps at some level
they have a subconscious fear that
they&#39;re wrong but they think they can
get away with it now by continuing to
act as though it doesn&#39;t exist much has
happened after the Wright brother&#39;s
airplane flew and it was very much
controversy about that from 1903 to 1908
one prominent critic who said it would
never fly never would be real could
never be done Simon Newcomb the
astronomer at the time he poo pooed it
even after he said oh yes well I guess
they really do have it after all but I
won&#39;t have passengers and won&#39;t be
practical and so forth yeah this whole
litany has occurred many times in other
controversies this one is particularly
intense because of the threat to
academic wisdom there&#39;s nothing worse I
found than suggesting to academic
physicists in particular and academics
in general that they are not only wrong
but disastrously wrong catastrophic
Olear Ong and that once they are proved
and shown in public to be the fools that
they are and the bad actors that they
are this possibly going to be some
punishment for them in terms of loss of
prestige and
and what have you that&#39;s that&#39;s why
they&#39;re resisting in the bulk you and it
will interact in a sort of a nonlinear
optics fashion it will do phase
conjugation and so eventually what it
what it does is everything going on is
feeding energy into the earth starts to
feed energy into that way that he
created so he gets a lot more energy in
his resonant wave fed from outside from
the environment in the interior of the
earth and that&#39;s the way he built up a
humongous wave of energy
