A dank, gray November night, 1991.

This was a rough time where another depressing day had passed. At this time in my life, I was eating poorly and sadly out of shape. After drinking a pot of coffee in an attempt to lift my sorrows, it was impossible to fall asleep. Lying in bed, tossing and turning for several hours, sleep was evasive. Around 3:00 am, still alert and wired, lying on my back, listening to the relaxing drone of my heartbeat, like counting sheep.

The form of muscle called the cardiac that so reliably beats like clock-work as was listened; Lub-thump, lub-thump, lub -- (silence) -- came completely to rest. I could immediately feel the blood flow slow down, and then completely stop in every part of the body. In that first second, I became 'detached' from the body and hovered within and around it. It was possible to see the surrounding bedroom and my body even though my eyes were closed. I was suddenly able to 'think' hundreds or thousands of times faster -- and with greater clarity -- than is humanly normal or possible.

Realizing that the next beat didn't arrive, I continued to feel the blood 'oxidizing' as it came to a complete rest in all veins and arteries. At this point, I realized and accepted that I had died; it was time to move on. It was a feeling of total peace completely without fear or pain, and didn't involve any emotions at all. Time itself suddenly became infinite and irrelevant. In 'earth time' only about ten seconds had gone by until my heart re-started beating, but 'I' was also in 'zero time' (for lack of a better word), or, actually outside of time.

This seemed to be a natural progression; there was an automatic review of my entire life -- every event ever experienced complete with emotions (but viewed objectively) -- rolling in front and around like a panoramic movie. From birth to death, in a linear fashion, observed without sadness or remorse. Yet in 'earth time', it only took (in my best estimation) a quarter second. Yet it seemed to be weeks spent replaying my life. Once it was complete, there were a few instructions that are more automatic but then I became immersed in infinite peace, bliss, and ecstasy. Unimaginable love; understanding so great, powerful; so awesome as to be humanly incomprehensible.

While I was there (and only there), access was given to knowledge; 'everything that ever was, is, and will be.' The true nature of the universe was suddenly clear as a bell, like a giant jig-saw puzzle. It seemed to have a perfect order to it -- in fact, it was evident that I was soon to become part of it. I was about to join the entity which could only be described as, God; so vast in dimension and scope only biblical words can come close to describing. Yet I checked back to see what was going on with my physical body, and couldn't leave until it was totally devoid of life.

At this point, about ten heartbeats (10-15 seconds) had failed. The body I observed lying in bed was mine -- but 'I' (soul/spirit) knew it wasn't time to leave. My time on earth wasn't up yet; there was still a purpose on Earth (more on that in a future article). When I was jolted back into the body, a stark realization hit. Here I was lying on this bed, rapidly losing physical consciousness, with no heartbeat. I then did the human thing, panicked in terror by jumping out of bed, and pounded my chest with my fist. It re-started. After walking downstairs in a nervous caution, shaking like a twig, dripping sweat, my heart was still beating irregularly.

After driving myself to the hospital, it was said that the heart muscle was suffering loss of nutrients, which caused it go into arrhythmia. There were a few close encounters after that, but soon disappeared after a diet and exercise change. I wasn't able to retain the knowledge given; the human brain is much too primitive and limited to house it. This intelligence requires an entirely different dimension to exist and comprehend. Yet it is part of our three dimensions as well -- just hidden out of view of our five senses. Yet I retain enough to remember the sheer awe.

The result of my NDE was profound and was the most 'real' event I've ever experienced. I seemed to be given an expansive knowledge and clear understanding of the world and universe that exists to this day. My once average IQ shot up to 148 shortly after. I have no fear of death whatsoever as I understand our life on this little planet is temporary and short, and what follows is great indeed. What is the meaning of life and our purpose here? To live and learn; experience the physical; go through trial and tribulation and joy. We are students at a school called Earth -- when the bell rings, we go back home -- with lessons learned. Again, I say this from my own actual experience.

Anyone who has gone through this, (millions have) knows how it immediately changes your life -- forever.

(Note to readers: My NDE, as profound as it was, resulted some years later in even far more glorious circumstances -- in fact, unprecedented. (To see whole story, go to: http://www.angelfire.com/or/truthfinder/Daniel.html)

Background Information:

Gender:	 Male

Date NDE Occurred:	  November 1991

  NDE Elements:

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Yes    Heart stoppage (fibrillation)  Clinical death   Heart stopped beating for some time.

How do you consider the content of your experience?      Mixed

The experience included:      Out of body experience

Did you feel separated from your body?    Yes  Already described, but was out of body.

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?       Far more conscious than humanly normal. Four dimensional.

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?       Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     Time as we know it in the material universe does not exist. One can live out seemingly infinite possibilities without restrictions.

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.    Very quiet.

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?       Uncertain     I'm sure I did, but attempting to remember is impossible; the human brain was not equipped to.

The experience included:       Void

The experience included:       Darkness

The experience included:       Light

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?       A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     Saw all knowledge and eternity. The entire universe, but no human can possibly bring such information back, within their brain.

What emotions did you feel during the experience?       Profound peace, love, joy.

The experience included:       Special Knowledge

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?       Everything about the universe     First of all, everything we've been taught regarding religion and their views of the afterlife and how to get 'into paradise,' with respect to punishment, etc., is basically wrong. We have already been saved. The only remaining issue is to save ourselves from our own hells and demons. Reincarnation is real. Everything has a purpose, cause and effect. The scale of God and the universe is far, far greater than we can comprehend.

The experience included:       Life review

Did scenes from your past come back to you?       My past flashed before me, out of my control     It was viewed with emotional detachment, like a movie, with crystal clear details. Things one normally would have forgotten are replayed as though it were happening all over again.

The experience included:       Vision of the future

Did scenes from the future come to you?       Scenes from the world's future     Although was given tremendous information that was not recalled at the time, it had something to do with a future, earth-shattering event involving WWIII or a widespread natural disaster.

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will   All I knew was that I had a mission to complete before going back. That mission has now been revealed at:  http://www.angelfire.com/or/truthfinder/Daniel.html    

God, Spiritual and Religion:

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       Yes     The belief systems we have on earth cannot accurately describe the afterlife.  My attitude toward life changed radically from 1991 on. So much so, it took seven years of constant misery and soul searching before finally accepting and coming to grips with it.

The experience included:       Presence of unearthly beings  

     After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      Yes   The magnitude, loss of time/space, sheer volume of knowledge given.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       Yes     More sensitive to light, people, crowds. Some precognitive and psychic abilities. Profound dreams.

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        Being blessed enough to see the other side is great. Trying to adapt afterwards was the worst.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    Tried at first to explain it to others, but many disbelieved. It is different now because NDEs are no longer viewed as 'an illusion' or fantasy. Learned eventually to avoid ridicule by not discussing it.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       To tell everyone to love your God with all your heart, mind and soul, love your neighbor as yourself, and build up treasures in heaven with charity. These are the things that count -- not religious systems.
