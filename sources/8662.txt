Experience description: &nbsp;           I loved  reading your definitions of soul mates.&nbsp;  It  seemed everything I had heard was about perfect contentment.&nbsp;   I have a partner that is in many ways very opposite of me.&nbsp;   I am impulsive and very excitable.&nbsp;  I  love looking at all spiritual things.&nbsp;  He  is very conservative, tending towards negative but highly emotional and  intuitive.&nbsp;  I on the other hand am  very positive tending to see things in a more positive light.&nbsp;   When we first met, I would have never dreamed we would end up spending  the next 14yrs together (the last 10 as a couple.)&nbsp;  He was married and we worked together.&nbsp;  We were good friends, but the thought of romance was the  furthest thing from my mind.&nbsp;  After  his divorce, we continued our friendship, but it was based on very selfish  interests.&nbsp;  He would tell me how  &quot;twisted&quot; I was, because I lead a very fast paced life.&nbsp;   One time during our friendship years, he made a comment, &quot;I know  this sounds strange, but I know we are going to end up together&quot;.&nbsp;   I just thought, yeah right, in your dreams!!&nbsp;   But slowly it turned it to a very difficult and tumultuous relationship.&nbsp;   Over the years we had a son together.&nbsp;   I began to realize that he was a very important part of my spiritual  growth, as I was for his.&nbsp;  What I  jumped into head 1st, he resisted like a mule.&nbsp;   I have many times wanted to leave him because of his negative attitude.&nbsp;

But with all  my heart, I know that I would only have to repeat these lessons with him.&nbsp;   I KNOW that we are together by preplan.&nbsp;   He has grown a great deal and so have I because of our conflicting  relationship.&nbsp;  Somewhere between us  is the right balance.&nbsp;  I see us moving towards that evenness each year.&nbsp;   We get along better now than we ever have, although it is still up and  down.&nbsp;  There has always been an  energy between us that is very strong.&nbsp;  When  he touches me, I can physically feel this energy.&nbsp;   He feels it to.&nbsp;  Many of my  friends (spiritual) have told me to leave him, he is holding me back.&nbsp;   But a very wise and very spiritual friend told me that having him in my  life gives me the greatest opportunity to work on my on tolerances and  advancements.&nbsp;  She understood that  the lessons and dances in this play we are in most helpful if they require us to  change and see things in a more &quot;detached&quot; way.&nbsp;   I know I have not explained this well, but I wanted to say thank you for  your comments.&nbsp;  This man is the love  of my life and the thorn in my side.&nbsp;  I  am grateful to him (well most of the time!) for being in mine.   </p>    </body>
