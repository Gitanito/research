How very flrange it appears to an attentive obferver.
that even in this enlightened age there fhould be fo many
perfons found who are thorough infidels to the doarine
of ficond caufis. and who prefer darknefs to light; yet
many fuch are in being. and it is to fuch that I beg ieave
to offer the.following remarks. hoping that fome ofthem
may ferve to elucidate. and be confidered q worthy of
the fubjea they are written in defence of.

fphere of life he is born to muft according to common
fenfe create a very confiderable difference in their fub.
fequent fortunes. Thia is a reamrk of a far abler writer
on this fcience than I am. Mr. J. Harris, ·ftudent in
Aftrology and phyfic, bas proved it in a mifcellaoy late-
ly publHhed, that it is poffible ¥Id plaufible that a ·prince
and a chimney-fweeper, or a nobleman and a beggar
may be born at the fame time ; but notwitbftanding,
fays be, the prince will not be a beggar, nor the beggar
a prince. Accordingly as one rifes in the world, fo will
the other, according to the fphere they may move in,
-and -thus will they be fubjea to the fame ebb and vifici..
tildes offortune. ·Suppofe a nobleman's child commands
an army, and by difobeying or rebelling againfl his king
he gets beheaded : the beggar's child may be a common
{oldier in the fame regiment, and for a. ftmilar offence
get hanged : no condition fo high-no eilate fo Jow-
but admits of greater brilliancy, or vice verfa. more
abjea Oavery.
Much bas been faid concerning the fate of childre11
who are twins, but it does not follow becaufe they arc.
{o that they are abfolutely born at the fame period.
\.; · Sometimes there are many hours between their births.
Few are born nearer than. fiftttn minutes of each other,
and this in fome particular cafta varies the figure, or ho-
rofcopc of bicth confiderably. But when they are bom
near to the fame time, undoubtedly their fate will be
JDuch the fame, particularly refpcaing the time of death.
Some years ago, I knew of two twin lifters, who were

the other. Even the mother of them drdted tlietn dif.
ferently the.better to diftinguiih them. They lived till
they were about four years of age. Ther both bad the
fmall-pox-one died of it·; and the other before lhe got
well ·of the diforder was fcalded to death, by pulling a
kettle of water from off tlte fire.-Much more might
be faid to prove a limilarity of fortune where the birtht
are nearly at the fame time.
·. Whether or not a mitigation of infortunes may be
brought about by means of a fore-knowledge of future
.events, is a qqerie I have not yet been able to get fatis-
Jaaorily folyed. You, Sir, feem to think that it is pof-
Jible for men in fome degree· to avert the e\'il portents
of unfortunate pofitions. Much may be faid on this fub.
jea. Certainlyin various diforders incident to human
nature, much may be done by phyfic; and if fuccefsfully
:adminifiercd,1his may be faid in fome degree to melio-
rate ,the evil affe8ion of malefic planetary influence; ·
.and therefore we fhould look upon it as difficult for an·
.aitift to give judgment by a decumbiture, when fomany
\rery ~xtraordinary evacuations and revuUions are fre-
quently made, by the often fuperlative and exhorbitant
praaiCe of bleeding. purging, and bliftering. For by
.fuch means as thefe the fiate of the fluids and folids
.mufl be mecerially altered, and as it .is by heat and moiil.. ·
ure, &c. that the planetary inRuence is(:onveyeCt, and as
we k110~ that a deprivation, or fuper.abundance of ei-

confideration. Formerly phyfic and Aili:ology went
h#nd in band. No doubt a due knowledge of the afiraf
c:auft' uf difeafes mull be a grand affilbnce to a judiciotH
phyfician. But the jargon mixt with the pr..Cticl' of
medicine, es difplayed by Paracelfus and others -0t hit
lime, has only tended-to bring Aflrology into difreputc;
for Paraaelfus not content with being thougbt an adept
in elementary philofophy, likewi~ wilhed the creduluut
to believe··that his renredies .(which were chiefly tcm·
·pofed of opium or mercury) were brought to hu9
through the means of foper-nalural agl'ncy;: and .indeecl,
in thofe days, every learned man, or pretender to learn-
ilig, was fuppofed to have his Familiar at his beck. Per•
haps it is for this reafoh that even the pure Allrology is
fo mli~h difcountenanced by the Legiilature-for when
it is duly confide'1cd how many ignor.mt perfons of botb
kxes pretend to tell forprifing flories relative 10 abfent
perfons by fea or land, &c. w ithout knowing even ttie
<haraaer of a planet, we need not be fo much furprized.
Mankind -
are:always too apt to give way to extremes-
;nd having be-en once duped by art, or ignorance, they--
afterwatds are often found to be infenfibly led aftray
from reafon, truth and conviEtion. This is but little
~nco'uragement, it muft be owned, for a featcbing and
inquifiti\:e mind; for to the •utgar a wrong opinion is
never wanting when any thing fubli!'1e is performed
which exceeds their confined comprchenfion. Hence
it wa!J,. that Dr. Fauftus (who is faid to~ the 6rll i11-

But what Authority ca11 they pretend to

their Authority therefore can be nothing

St. Paul feems by his rugged Nature to
have had Stars and Afped:s fwaying his
Geniture as the ufurper Cromwell had in

and brought his Body into Subjeetion, and.
by that Means made ufe of all his violent
Paffions of Nature, to ftir up the more Zeal
and Fervency in God's {ervice;t whereas

{o much the greater Villain. Such another
Pattern as thisfeeins to have been the famous

the Stars, but Fools are ruled by them unto

be was a Man famous for interpreting
of Dreams; and this is a Facuity com•
monly ac:companying Aftrology, and fuch
as by Rules of Art may be aptly known,
without divine Infpirations.t Of Jofeph,
.Diodorus Siculus, the ancient Hiftorim hath
faid much1 how he contributed not a little
to the Art.of the Plow, which was taught
by Ofiris and His, and how he taught them
very many learned Matters, both concerning
Religion and the State,; and concerning
Things to come : he calls him_ Hermes
Trifinegiftus indeed, but that Jofeph was
the fame Hermes he fpake of, is very plain
to be undedlood, both by the Time and Age
wherein Hermes lived, and alfo. by his Reli-
gion, ofwhich Diodorus faith, that h1: taught
a Religion by himfelf, and contrary to all the
Ways of Wodhip that were ever known
amongfr the Egyptians before him; and he

fays, that he was the mo.ft honored of the
King above all Men, far that he had found
t:Jut, and coufzjelled unto many 'thi'.'gs, condu-
cing to the benefit of.Man•s Life{which Is
the very Ch~raCl:er of Jofeph in holy Writ.
Now of this Man, fays Diodcmis, he was oae
of the fir.ft who was ikilled in the Stars.
And the Aphorifms ofHermes the Egyptian
are extant unto this Day; which although
I do not believe th.ey were taught by Mofes,
who was the gteateft Hermes of Egypt, yet
being fathered upon,him, it argues that he
was a famous Afl:rologer efteetned of old ;
for that thofe antient Things wanting a cer-
tain Father, were fathered upon him, as ifhc
baa been the Fountain of that Learning.
Such Kind of Aftrologers feem a1fo to

From what has been advanced, it is {uffi...

_that Man, in this State of Corruption, may

of HEAVEN, from the Works ofthe learn·
ed and much-efreemed Philofopher and
Aftrologian, MORINUS; and in doing
this, I £hall adhere as much to the Spirit
and Letter of the Author, as the Nature of
a Tranilation will permit.
" It is a Falt,1' fays this excellent Author,
"which preponderates iri the Balance of
Reafon, and highly claims our fober Con-
fideration, that the Life of Man is refol-
vable into four difi:inct Periods or Ages;
M namely,

82 A' DEFENCE
namely, Infancy, Youth, Maturity, and old
Age 7 though it may be. faid, with ftrict
Truth, that fcarcely half the human Race
attain to the Conclufion of only their third
· Period. In the ConftruB:ion ofMan, there-
fore, we difcover four AffeCl:ion·s, into which
all other Things appear to be reducible, as
fr were to their firft Beginning; namely,
Life, ACl:ion, Marriage, and Paffion. Thefe
agree with the Rife, PerfeCl:ion, Declination,
and Termination ofall Things, and comprife
the whole Effects and Operations of Nature.
For Man is truly faid to rife into the vVorld,
the Moment he receives Refpiration and
Life ; to be in PedeCl:ion, when he attains
to Manhood and Maturity, and to the Pro-
pagation of the Species; to decline, when he
begins to lofe the innate radical Principle of
Heat and Moifture ; and to fuftain the laft
Paffion of Life, when he ceafes to breathe,
and filently finks into the Grave. The Life,
ACl:ion, Marriage, and Paifions qf Men, are,
therefore, governed by the fame celeftial
Principle which regulates the Birth, Per-
feCl:ion,.

fed:ion, Declination, and Dilfolution of all
other Things. Wherefore; Life, in the Syf-
tem ofNature, is regulated by the eaft Angle
of the Heavens, called the Afcendant; Ac-
tion, .by the fouth Angle, or JYiidheaven ;
Marriage, by the wejt Angle; and Paffion,
by the north Angle of the heavenly Frame.
And hence arife four Triplicities of the fame
Genus or generical Nature; and.twelve Hou-
fes, as heretofore defcribed. The firfi Tri-
plicity is ofthe eaftern Angle or Afcendant,
attributed to lntancy, and called the Tripli..:.
city of Lite, including- the · firft, ninth,
and fifth Houfes ; which behold each other
in a partile Trine in the Equator, where
this rational Divifion of the Twelve Houfes
is made."
"Man either does or ought to live in a
·threefold Refpect; in himfelf, in GOD, and
in ·h.is Pofterity: for, the great Ends, for
which he was created, are to wodhip and
glorify his MAKER, and to propagate his

every Man to exercife towards his Neigh-

Difeafe; ari-fing either from the_ Treachery
and Perfecution of Enemies, from the

Poverty and Want. Thefe, with a long
Train ofconfcquent Miferies, are appropri-

in vain, fu.ffers nothing to be annulled.
Wherefore, according to the fecond Motion

an Entrance is made out ofthe eighth into

Thus have I given my Reade~s the Me-

.the TRUTINE OF HERMES, and, as it
is the only true Way that has been given in
the Englifh...Language, I hope it will prove
acceptable to the real Lovers of the veiled
Beauties of DIVINE URANIA; but I
mu.ft however obferve, that this Mode of
Rectification
Digitized by GoogIe

Reetification will not hold true in the GE-
N ITURES ofthofe Perfons, when the Ejli-
mate or given Time of Birth exceeds more
than two Hours of the Real; therefore the
Nativities ofaged Pa:fons muft confequently
be rectified by the Accidents which have
already: happened to the Native ; ~d to that
Purpofe muft be collected in readinefs fo
many as can poffibly be procured. and thofe
eminent ones, together with · the certain
Time, (viz.) the Year and Month, and, if
poffible, the Day when they happened;
but the Month and Year will fufficiently
ferve, ifno nearer Time can be legally ob-
tained, but fometimes the ASTROLO-
G IAN is obliged to accept of the Year
without the :Month. , The ~ality ofthofe
Accidents, ought to be fuch Misfortunes,
Sickneffes, or Cafualities, as have happened
to the Body, and thefe are to be expeCted
from the ASCENDANT being directed to
malevolent PROMITTORS ; wherein it
mu.ft be conlidered that the ASCENDANT, .
being the HOUSE OF LIFE, from whence
WC

we begin our Work, is called here the SIG-
NIFICATOR, as fignifying fuch and fuch
an Accident, or Sicknefs, fhall befal the
Native. Now the Planet directed unto, ei-
ther by Body or Afpect, .is called the PRO-
MITTOR; and he thews the Greatnefs and
~ality of the Accident, or Sicknefs; or
promifes to perform what the SIGNIFI-
CATOR declared was to come. &c. The
MEDIUM CCELI is another SIGNIFI-
CATOR, which we direct to it's feveral
PROMITTORS, for HoNoR, .PREFER-
MENT, MA·RRIAGE, &c. And verily a
GENITURE cannot be exactly rectified,
but by Accidents belonging to one or both
thofe Angles above alluded to. The Sun
being the Prince of the planetary Syfiem, is
a fuperior Significator in every NATIVI-
TY, fo is the Moon, and the Part of For-
tune. Yet a complete and fufficient Recti-
fication from thefe cannot be had ; thefe
are called the Hylegiacal, or principal Places
in the GENITURE, by Direction whereof,
all the principal Affairs and Contingencies

belonging to every Perfon, in a natural
, Courfe of Life, are found out, both in ~a­
lity what; and in Meafore ofTime when.
Having faid thus much concerning the
Rectification of Nativities, it will doubtlefs
appear plain and obvious to the meaneft
U uderftanding, that the true Aflendant
muft be exactly verified, before the Afiro-
logian proceeds to give {pofitive Judgment ·
upon the Native's horofcopical Figure of
Birth. Thi~ is certainly a very hard and
difficult Tafk ; and, fhould we err in this
very important Part of the Work, all our
Calculations will prove abfurd and errone..
ous. It muft certainly be evident, to every
Perfon, that the heavenly Bodies are in con-
tinual Motion, and therefore, every ten or
fifteen Minutes muft certainly vary their
Pofition confiderably; as does alfo various
Parallels from any one given Point of the
Heavens; and hence it is, that the Latitude
of the Place of Birth, as well as the true
ASCENDANT, or perfect Time of the
NATIVITY, becomes fo abfolutely necef-

As the Dod:rine of Nativities is the very
E!fence of ASTROLOGY,, and the origi-

Judge of the Utility and Reafonablenefs of

that when the Sun and Moon are1n a par~

they arc then very unfortunate ,; nor for the

hath moil: Dignities in the Places aforefaid,
be not in an aphetical Houfe of Heaven,
then without further Trouble, take the Ho-

Bdides, it muft be obferve,i, in diurnal
Nativities, that particular Reg;1rd muft
ever be had to the Degree of the Ecliptic
wherein the new IVIoon was, before the
Birth, though a foll 1\1oon intervened a lit-

if an Oppofition, take the Part of Fortune,
if it be found in an aphetical Place, other-

Again, in noeturnal Genitures, great
Care mufi: be taken refpetl:ing the Oppofi~

of that Light, which, at the Time of the

As, FOR ExAMPLE.-in the nocturnal

I have now delivered what the ancien~

there are fome who receive the Horofcope,

QF THE wAYS OF PROROGATION,
ACCORDING TO PTOLEMY.
The APHETA, or PR.oRoGATuR, being
fo determined, we ought to_
admit two Ways
of Prorogation, according to PTOLEMY;
one of which is made only_on the confequent
Signs, under that which is called AcTINo~
BOL I A, or a Projection of Rays, when the
Prorogator is in an oriental Place; that is,
in a Place between the Midheaven and the
H.orofcope. This, therefore, we ought to
affume; and not only this, which is to con-
fequent Signs, but a1fo to the precedent
Signs, according to that which is called
H.bRIMEA; which is when the APHET A
is in a Place declining from the Midhea-
ven.
Thefe Things being fo, there are inter-
ficient Degrees, according to the Proroga-
tion which is made to the precedent Signs._
The Degree of the occidental !'lori~on,
only, is interflcient, becaufe it defiroys the
LoRD OF L1F E. But the other Degrees
bf the Stars, fo occurring or tefiitying, fub-
trad

tract from, or add to, the colle~ed Numbers,
until the PROROGATOR is ftt: but they
do not kill, becaufe they are. not carried to
the APHETIC PLACE, but that rather to
other Places.
The Beneficks, therefore, add, and the
Maleficks fubtraet ; but Mercury is adapted
I
to thofe by whom he is beheld. The Situ-
ation of the Degree of each, indicates the
Number of Addition or SubtraCl:ion ; for.
how many !hall be the horary Times ofthe
Degree of each, fuch !hall b~ the Number
of Years : but, by Day, the Times of the
diurnal Parts, by Night,
, the Nocturnal,;
muft be confidered ; but this ought to be
obferved when they are in the Afcendant.*
Afterwards to fubtraCl:, according to the
Proportion of Diftance, ·until, they coming
to the Weft, nothing remains~
But the Places of the Maleficks, Saturn_
and Mars, kill according to the Prorogation
made to the following Signs; when they

either meet bodily or caft their Rays from
any where, wheth~r it be ~arti)e or Oppo.
lition; and fo,metimes in Sextiles, proceed.
jng from Signs obedient or beholding, be...
caufe of their Equipolence; and alfo a quar.
tile Configuration, from the following Signs
to the APHE.TIC PLACE; and alfo a Sex...
tile, evilly affeCted, when it is in Signs of
long Afcenfion; yea, and befides, the Trine,
in Signs of ihort Afcenfion, kills ; as w~ll
the folar Place, if the Moon be HYLE G :
and the Rencounters made in Cuch a Proro.~
gation can kill or fave, becaufe foch Occur-
fes are carried to the A.PHETIC PLACf;
direct.
Thefe Places, (viz.) the Places of Saturn
and Mars, are not always ANARETIC,
but only ~hen they arc evilly Affetl:ed ; .and
their ANARETIC Part is impeded, when
it falls ip the Terms of a Benefick; or if
any of the Beneficks ca~ a quartile, trine,
or oppofite R!ty, to the very ANARETIC~L
Pt>INT, or to thofe which follow it; (in
Jupiter not above twelve Degrees, ·and in
Venus
Digitized by GoogIe
OF NATIVITIES. 125
Venus not above eight,) or, if the Body of
the Prorogator, <!nd the occurrent Part, have
·not both the fame Latitude.
Therefore, .when the afiifting, or ANA-
RETIC RA;ys, are found two or more on
each Side, you mufi: obferve which is th::
ftrongefl: in Power and Number ; in N um-
ber, when fome exceed others in Multitude;
in Power, when . the affifting, or killing
Stars, are fome of them in proper Places and
others not; and, chiefly, when fome of them
are Oriental and fome Occidental; for, ge-
nerally, none of thofe that are under the Sun
Beams are to be left, either to kill or to
fave; unlefs, when the rvfoon is APHET A,
the Place of the Sun affiitl:ed by fome Ma-
leficks joined ' to it, and receiving Freedom
from none of the Beneficks, caufeth death.
The Number of Years, arifing from th~
Diftance between the APHETIC and ANA-
R ET 1c Place, is not taken, fimply and in-
diforeetly, always from the Afcenfions of
the Times of each Planet; but then, only,
when the ORIENT po!feifeth the PRORO-
GATION,

GA TION, or fome other which arifeth in
· the ORIENTAL HoR1zoN. For there. is
one Scope, alone, propofed to him that
would naturally confider, after how !Ilany
equinoxial Times the Place of the following
Body, or Ray, cometh to the Place of that
which precedeth, in the GENITURE ;
becaufe the equinoxial Times equally pafs .
the I-Iorofcope and Midbeaven, according to
both which, the Likeneifes of tlie local Dif-
tances are taken ; and each Time fignifies a
folar Year.
Therefore, feeing thofe•Things are fo, it
is fit, when ~he APHETIC and precedent
Place be in the oriental Hr;nzon, that the
Afcenfions, even to the Meeting of the De-
grees, be taken : for the AN ARE TA, after fo
many equinoxial . Times, cometh to the
APHETIC PLACE, that is, to the ORJEN.,.
TAL HORIZON; but, when the APHETIC
'PLACE is found in the Midheavcn, we

But, whe1y the APHETIC PLACE ism
the occidental Horizon, we ought to take
the Defcenfions in which each Degree of
the Diftance is carried down ; that is, in
which the Degrees oppofite to them are
carried upwards.
But, when the APHETIC and preceding
Place is not in thefe three mentionedLimits,
but in fome Sp1ce between the Times of
thefe Afcenfions and Defcenfions, or Cul-
minatibns, they do not carry the following
Places to the Precedent, but others; for,
the Places are like the fame which have one

Pofition, and are in the fame Degrees, in

this happens to them which are fituate near-
eft to one of the Semi-circles defcribed by
Sections ofthe lVIeridian and Horizon ; each
of which Semi-circles, according to the
fame Situatio'n, maketh the temporal Hours
very equal. '
Therefore, as it is carried by thG: fame
Places, it comes to the fame Pofition, both

ene Method, that if the APHE TA and prece-
dent Place have an.oriental Pofition, or l\Ie-
ridional, or Occidental, or any other, from
the Analogy of the T'mes which are
brought to the APHETIC PLACE, we take
the following Place. The Way is thus:
Taking the Degree of the Zodiac which
is on the Midheaven, and the precedent,
and alfo the fubfequent; firfr, we confider
what Pofition the precedent Degree hat~,
and how many unequal Hours it is difrant
:from the l\tleridian; and, numbering the
Afcenfions ofa right Sphere, which we find
between the confidered and the precedent
Degree and the' Midheaven, whether it be
above or under the Earth, we divide them
into the Number of horary Times of the

Place, is difi:ant, fo many equal temporal
I-lours, from the fame Meridian, as the pre•

the Beginning. the following Degree was
difi:ant from the Degree on the Midheaven,
and, how many it was diftant, when it made
the equal temporal Hours in the precedent;
and, multiplying thefe into the Number qf

fince it is my Wifh to give Offence to no
Perfon or Perfons whatfoever, I .fhall only
contemplate the fecret Propert_ies of the ~
HEAVENL y Bonns in this Nativity,
whereby a Perfon of mean Abilities may
readily invefiigate their occult Power and
Injluence, in any other GENITURE, of a

I fhall begin with obferving: that in the
N ative's foregoing celefiial Confiitution: we
find the latter Part of the fiery and equi-
noCl:ial fign, Aries, occupying· the oriental
Horizon, with Taurus intercepted in the Af-
cendant; fo that Mars and Venus are the'
Significators of the Native, both of which,
we find, are greatly depreifed. Mars, being
Lord of the Afcendant, difpofes ofthe Moon, .
in the radical Horofcope, whom we find
extremely affiieted, in the twelfth Houfe,
in a violent Sign, but in the Dignities ofthe
benefick Planet, Jupiter; we alfo find her,

Ray ofJupiter, Lord ofthe Houfe ofDeath;
but I muft, however, obferve, that they are
within Orbs of each other, thetefore the
AfpeCl: is p!atick, becaufe the Moon; as foon
as {he entered the Sign, Aries, did certainly
appJy to Jupiter by a partile dexter Square
in the Zodiac. Mars, beipg Lord of the
Afcendant, is pofited in the feventh Houfe,
in. the Dignities of Venus, and, at the fame
Time, greatly affiiCl:ed by ,an,Oppofition of
the malevolent, and ponderous Planet, Sa-
turn, who is located in the Native's Afcen-
dant, with the bright Star in the Jaw of the
Whale: ther~fore, from thefe important
Pofitions and Configurations, we may rea- ·
dily make our Judgment final, (:viz.) that
the Native cannot live four Years, and,
that, for Want of Nouri!hment. There is
not a Planet but what is accidentally afRiCl:ed,
and, therefore, as .the Pofitions of the Erra-
tiq, every Way confidered, are fo extremely

evil, this vtai.11 certainly prove one amohg the
Number ofthe mortal GENITUR&s.
Upon a further lnfpeCtion of the Native,s
celeftial Figure of Birth, we find the Sun
and Mercury are Lord.s of the fixth Houfe,
pofited in the twelfth, which PTuLEMY,
·in his QEADRIPARTITE, calls the Man-
fion ofthe evil Demon. Saturn here difpo-
fcs of Jupiter, in the radical Horofcope, a.pd
both of them are Lords of the ' twelfth.
Venus, having Dignities in .the Afcendan~
is combu.ft of the Sun, the Fountain of Life
and Motion. , ·Thefe are all evil Con.figura-
tions and Pofitions; therefore, was it p.
offi-
ble for the Native to furvive the aforefaid
Time, which, I think, it cannot, it's' Life
would certainly prove very unfortunate ; for
the principal Significators are greatly depref..
fed, and behold each other by violent Rays.

In this Figure we find the c~leftial and

of Death, pofited in the Afcendant, in his

It may not be improper to acquaint my

and Ridicule, particularly by the Native's
Parents, hy whom I was requefted to caft
this NATIVITY; But, according to the
Power and Influence ofthe ~eavenly Bodies,
(asjecondary Cazifes, under GOD, the great

and Envy, my Predictions on the foregoing

This is a remarkable N.itivity, having all
the Planetsfubterranean; which, in allCafcs,
is an unfortunate Omen, but more particu-
larly in the prefent; becaufe, in the Native's
celefi:ial Figure of Birth, there is not fo
· much as a fingle benevolent Ray, -that ca11
(ufficiently affifi: either the Sun, Moon, or
Lord of the Afcendant. Therefore, in Or-
der ·to make this Speculation frill n1ore plairt

are, as yet, unacquainted with the true Prin-
ciples of elementary Influx and aftral Affec-
tion, I {hall, (in this Place,) take a minute
Infpect:ion of the Difplay of the celeftial
Wanderers in the foregoing GENITURE.
In the Native's Figure of Birth we find
nine Degrees twenty-one Minutes ofCapri-
corn horofcopical ; which gives Saturn for
the Lord of the Afcendant, and Significator
ofthe Native; whom we find pouted in the
fourth Houfe, which reprefents the Grave,
.or final Termination of all Things; he is,
Jllfo, elevated in the Terms of Mars, who

received in the Terms of the fame male.fick
Planet. The Sun is Lord of the Light~
pofited in the third, without the leaft Ray
of Affifl:ance from the Benevolents.-Sa-
turn, being Lord of the Afcendant, is con-
joined with the fiery Planet Mars, in the
]mum Cadi; and the latter Planet we find is ·
within- Orbs of a quartile Irradiation with
the I\1Ioon, 1.•;ho, in this Nativity, is the
true HYLEG, PRoROGA TOR, ' or Giver of
Life; we alfo find her received in the
Terms of Mercury, Lord of the fixth and
eighth Ho'J[es.--The Sun, th~ Fount1in of
Life and Motion, is pofited very near the
Girdle of Andromeda, a Star of the Nature
and Influence of Venus; but this Pofition
cannothavcthe leafl: Power, for we find both
the Luminaries difpofed of by Enemies ;. '
and the violent Pb.net, M~trs, has E~alt.t­

though he is a Frr"end to Nature, we here

Houfe; the Moon, after ihe feparated from
the Body of Jupiter, did apply to a partiie
quartile Afpect: with Mars, and from thence
to a Sextile with the'Sun, ~nd, lafily, to the
quartile Rays of Saturn ; at which Time it
will be readily perceived that the Moon had
feparated very far from the Body ofJupiter;
and that his friendly Rays, or the Beams of
the benevolent Planet Venus, could not join
in the Afpea:, to oppofe the evil and malig-
nant .Power and Efficacy of Mars and Sa-
turn. The Moon came to a zodiacal qaar-

Pofition of the benevolent Jupiter, in the

Power or Influence.-The Conjunction of
the Moon with Mars, in a violent Sign,.and
under the Earth, has a very difagreeable and
powerful Influence ; but more particularJy
in the prefent Cafe, becaufe the Moon is
fixed in her Detr1inent, and, at the fame
Time, elevated in the Terms ofa male.fick
Star.-Therefore, from the foregoing Con..

fiderations, it became plain and obvious to
me, that when the Sun, the Giver ofLife,
came to an Oppofition with the malevolent
Planet, Saturn, in this Geniture, the Native
would certainly depart this Life; becaufe
Saturn, in this Nativity, is certainly the
ANAR~TA, or killing Star.-Thofe who
will take the Trouble and Pains to calculate
the Place and Pofition of the two fuperior
Significators, in the Native's celeftial Figure
of Birth, will find, the exaCl: Oppofition of
the APHET A and AN ARET A was ,formed

Day of November, following, at feventeen

companied with an internal Fever, and ex.
pired in the greateft Agonies.
Many other Genitures, of this and the
like Nature, I could here give my Readers,
to prove that an ASTROLOGY in the,

in Reality and Truth.-1 have examined,
and am convinced, that the heavenly Bodies
have a SECREr_, INFLUENCE on ·
Things of THIS GLOBE, which all the
Power and Contrivance of Man is not able
to refirain.
If a Survey be taken of the Objeetions
that are made, by the Unbelievers, againft
.this SUBLIME _
and SACRED SCIENCE,
they will be found to be· very few :-one is,
that it overthrows the Belief of Revelation :
but, I prefumc, this mufi: be impofiible;
for, if there be an ASTROLOGY in the
HEAYENS, as there undoubtedly is, and
it can be demonflrated from various Parts of
the WORD OF GOD, it mufi eflablilh it;
for TRUTH cannot overcome TRUTH,
but mufl fupport it.-The fecond Objec-
tion is, that it is a diabolical Art, aided
by Compact with evil Spirits :-this is an
Objeltion as Ignorant as it is Ridiculous ;
for, it is well known, to Perfons but little
acquainted with this HEAVENLY SCI-

it depends on Experience, and is founded
on OBSERVATION, ASTRONOMY,

From what is above mentioned, I con-
ceive, any candid Perfon may difcover that
this is an ancient Science, and that the Art

tivity, and tell you, without any long Pre...
amble, that I think I dare be pofitive the
Life of the N2.tive will not be of long Du-
ration, and my Reajom in CELESTIAL
SCIENCE are as follows.
In the Native's annexed horofropical
Figure of Birth, we find the celefi:ial and
tropical Sign, Capricorn, riling in the eaftern
Finiter of the Heavens; and Saturn,.being
Lord thereof, is retrograde, and pofited in
the Imum C{di~ in the T.erms of the violent
Planet, f\fars ; and alfo in Conjunetion with
evil fixed Stars, of the Nature of Mars and
the Moon ;. a11d, at the fame Time, we find
him within Orbs of an Oppofition of the
Sun; thefe arc all Arguinents of Violence,
and falling immediately together, confe-
quently render the Period of Life of a frill
lefs Duration. ·
Upon a further Infp~Clion of the Native's
Figure of Birth, -vve find the Sun pofited in

volent Planet, Jupitcr; in v;hich Po.fitiorl.

he certainly is the true HYLEG, APHE-
T A, PROROGATOR, or Giver ofLife.-
The Afcendant is, alfo, befriended by the
benevolent Erratics, Jupiter and Venus ;
.and both of them are within the Rays ofan
Oppofition with the Moon, who is pofited
in her own Houfe, in the watery Sign, Can-
cer, thefe Pofitions and Configurations will
certainly fave for a Time, but cannot over-
power the evil and malevolent Influence of
.Saturn, Mars, and the Moon, who are all J ;
Promittors by Direflion; we alfo find the
violent and fiery Planet, lVIars, occupying
the Native's Afcendant, in his Exaltation,
and in mundane quartile AfpeB: with the
Sun, the APHETA, or Giver efLife, the
Harbinger of Violence, and the Prefage of
I)eath. •
But, before I begin to work up the kill-
ing or anaretic l)irections, in this Nativity,
I muft paticularly obferve, that the Moon,
the Author of radical Nouri.lhment and
Moifiure, is affiiB:ed by the Parallel of Mars
m Mundo, and in his Terms ; this will
fubjea:

Reafon that the Native will live beyond the
Time pointed out by the APHETA to the
Oppofition of Saturn .in the Zodiac; this is,
certainly, ·a mortal DireClion, becaufe Sa-
turn, in this Nativity, is the ANARETA,
cor killing Star: it is followed by the APHE-
T A to the ~artile ofMars in Mundo, di-
nB DireC/ion ; and the Sun to the ~:1r­
rile of the Moon in lvlundo, con<Lwfe Motion:
thefe are the Directions in the H~avens that
will deil:roy Life, becaufe there is not a fin-
:;le benevolent Ray that can fall in, to fave.
I
"' It may not be impr0per to acquaint my Read~rs, in
this Pli!te, that the water Gripes, and Matter in the
~tomach, were not occafiohed only by ~fars' Parallel
with the Moon; but by Jupiter aad Ve~us in Capricorn,
in Oppolition with the Moon in Cancer; for Saturn
an<l Mercury, (1s Erratics,) and Taurus, Virgo, and
Capricorn, (<ls Signs,) are cold, tart, four, and aflrin-
gent; much like the Nature cf Alum; fo that when

I come, in the ~ext Place, to confider·the
nnaretic Directions above mentioned; and,
becaufe the Sun is the true HYLEG, A-
PHETA, or Giver ofLife, I ihall firft be-
gin with him. ,
The true Longitude of the APHETA,
for the given Time of Birth, is eighteen
Degrees, twenty. Minutes, of Scorpio; his
right Afcenfion, two hundred and twenty-
five Degrees, fifty-one Minutes; Declina-

South ; Diftance from the Medium Cteli, two
Pesrees, twenty Minutes; his femi-diurnal
horary Times, eleven Degrees, twelve Mi-

thirty-fix Minutes.
The firft DireCl:i9n; in the ANARETIC

is the Sun to the Oppofition of Saturn in

fubjetl: to fuch Infirmities as this Diretl:ion
points out ; which, according to my Judg-
ment, will prove fufficient to fUt offLife.
The next Dirctl:ion, in this deadly Train,
that offers itfelf to us, is the Sun to the

Reader, I will work.

Pole of the Afcendant, is eleven Degrees,
fifty-feven Minutes ; the Difiance of the
Signfficator from the Midheaven, by right
Afcenfion is two Degrees twenty Minutes.-
Then, by the Rule of Proportion, if eleven
Degrees, twelve Minutes, being the femi...
diurnal horary Times ofthe Prorogator, givo
two Degrees, twenty Minutes, for his Dif•
tance from the Medium Cceli; what Diftance
will nine Degrees, fifty-two Minutes, the
femi-diurnal horary Times of the P.ROMIT-
TOR, give ?-You will find the Anfwer, or
fecondary Difta~ce, obtained by this Pro-
portion, will be two Degrees three Minutes; · ·
which, being fubtraCl:ed from the primary
Difiance of the Pr9mittor from the Horo-
fcope,-the :Remainder will be nine De..
grees, fifty-four Minutes, for the true Arch
of Direction.

awful and deadly Train, is the Sun to the

The Difrance of the PROivIITTOR
from the feventh Houfc, by oblique Defcen-

feven Degrees, fifty-two Minutes; the
Difrance of the PROROGATOR from
the Midheaven, is two Degrees, twenty l\!Ii-

11ine Degrees, twenty-feven Minutes, being -
the femi-noll:urnal horary Times ~f the Pro-

nutes, for her Difiance from the Weft ;
what Difrance will eleven Degrees, t\vclve

will be nine Degrees, nineteen Minutes ;
which, added to the prim;uy Difrance of
the PROROGATOR from the Mediu11t
Cceli, the Sum will be·ekven Degrees thirty-
nine Minutes, for the Arch of Direction.
Thus have I given the Operation, at large,
ofevery Direction in this awful Train, that

ril of our earthly Pilgrimage : the other is,

pered, by its celefiial Po.fition, with ~ali­
ties exaCl:ly oppofite to the Giver if Life,,·
therefore, whenever it can form an evil Con-

tainly defi:roy and overcome its preferving
~ower and Efficacy, by the fuper-abundant
Energy of oppofing Matter, which nothing
lefs than a fupernatural Caufe can, either
alter or prevent. And, therefore, when that
certain Caufe, that vegetative Power and
Influence, which fopports Nature arid fuf-

its Exiftence theh certainly becomes anni-

in the foregoing Nativity, being conftituted
of a direct oppofite Efficacy to the SuN, ·
will, when they form that Oppofition in the
Zodiac, before mentioned, entirely deftroy
its aiEfting Power and Influence ; in which
C:i.fe, whatever was nourifhed and brought

Having now completely invefiigated the
Difpofition of the celeftial Bodies in this.
Nativity, according to_their refpective Hea-
Tenly States, let us leave the Event unto our
ALMIGHTY CREATOR, and content
ourfelves with TIME, which is the FA-
THER- OF TRUTH, and which will
certainly bring to Light, either the Truth
or Fallhood of my Writings.

Thus, in the preceding Sheets, having
given my Readers a Collection of curious
Genitures, (which, I conceive, are worthy
the Attention of thofe who wifh to become
acquainted with the true Principles of this
faq:ed and fublime Science)-1 fhall not,
therefor~, in this Work, prefume to treat
on introductory Obfervations; it being a
Performance I inte,nd hereafter, ·(God will-
zng) to give unto the Public, in a plain and
methodical Way, complete; and fet forth

, Works of moft Aftrologers who have ever
wrote in the Englifh Language, and, at pre-
fent, have found nothing fatisfactory ;-the
Methods of directing a Significator to its

and, I obferve~ Authors .have differed in

LEMY erroneous; but, notwithftanding
foch E;/forts, I have ever found, in the
Courfe ofmy PraCtice, that his Precepts are
to be depended on ; and have never yet ex-
perienced one Example, to convince me of
the Illegality of his Doctrine, when the ce-
lefiial Figure of Birth wa·s truly reCtified.
Concerning the ReCl:ification of Nativi-
ties, I am forry to fay, much has been writ-
ten, by various Authors, to very little Pur-
pofe;-with fome, it is a Matter ofnqlmport-
ance,_.whether the Afcendant, or Planets
pofited therein, or the Lord of the Horo-
fcope, or his Difpofitor, exactly defcribe the
Perfon of the Native; and, I {hall further
obferve, that I am very confident, the com-
mon Method of Rectification will not avail>
until the true Sign, which ought to afcend
the oriental Horizon, be perfectly known. ·
The Method, therefore, to come to the
Knowledge of the true. Afcendant,· when
the eftimate. Time of- Birth is out of the
Reach of the Trutine of Hermes, (as given
in 'this Work,) is a Matter which has puz-
zled moft Aftrologers ; I have taken fo1ne
Paing

Pains in the Invefi:igation of this Matter, in
particular, and my Endeavours have been
crowned with Succefs; having in my Pof-
feffion, at this Time, many Nativities, in
Manufcript, which I have calculated by the
Placidian Method, and which I intend here-
after to publi!h to the World, that the real
Lovers of this Learning may be con\llinced
of the Verity ofmy Difcovery, in afcertain-
ing the true Afcendant of any Perfon. 1\.
Secret in Science it certainly is, and to atuin
it, I have worked hard in the Cabin~t of
Nature.
The genethliacal Part of Afirology, in
. .
Times pail:, was in fuch Requefi:, and fo far
honoured with the Stamp of public Autho-
rity, that the greateft and mofi: learned Per-
fonages deemed it no Difparagement to be
accounted knowing therein : nor was it lefs
than an admirable Encouragement to active
Undedl:andings, that the moft eminent Per-
fons were, not only Patrons of, but the
chiefefi: Precedents in, this illufi:rious Learn·
ing. Among all the Scrutinies that the
Underfi:anding of Man is occupied about,

the Studyofthe heavenly Bodies may deferv-
edly claim a principal Place; for that it
treateth ofthe choicefl, and moft myjleriou.s
and admirable, of all Knowledge.
I conceive, I need not, (to prove the An-
tiquity and Verity of this Lean~ing,) ·relate,
from Jofephu.r, how that it was praetifed in
, the firft Ages of the World, and that the
holy Patriarchs themfeJves were ftudious
therein; nor cite the Authority of that
learned Italian, who, more than probably,
proves (and that from Scripture and good
Reafon,) that the REDEEMER ofthe World
(BLESSED FOR EVER,)- did allow of this
Science: thefe Truths are fo confpicuous
and formidable, that they need no Support
of Argument from my Pen.
The Truth and Excellency of this Learn-
ing, every individual Artift may, at his own
Leifure, obferve and prove :-Ifany object
that this Science is vain, and unattainable ;
to fuch I anfwer, that he can he no real
Artifl who judges it impoffi,ble. If what
has been advanced be not fufficient, I fur-
ther add, that, as there is no Reafan for me,
or

er any other Man, to believe that the ~un is
not rife~, when we fee him upon the Meri-
dian ; bec:rnfe a blind Afan, who cannot fee,
affirms it : fo there is m more Reafon for me,
<>r another, to believe there is not a Reafan
for a Subject or Matter (which we knovr
there is a fofficient Reafon for;) upon the
Word or Affir,mation of him, who (being
blind in his Intellefl) cannot fee or appre-
,hend it: and, I doubt not but manifold Ob..:
fervations and Experience, will, in a lhort
Time, give an indubitable Proof thereof.
True it is, indeed, that, through Mijlake;
this heavenly Science ha\h greatly fuffered in ..,.___
Reputation; and-that from the Tongues
and Pens of the pious and learned, as well as
envious and ignorant Adverfaries ; infomuch
as many young Students, however fufficicnt-
ly well qualified with the Endowments of
Nature, to read the facred Leifons of
Heav~n, have yet feared to employ their
Talents that Way, merely becaufe ofan iU
Name; But, "God forbid (fays the Rev.
Dr. BUTLER, in hisfacred Defence ofA.f-
trology,) that all the World ihould be Pz!fil-

lamimus."-Now, as it is not my Wiih to
defend this SCIENCE any further than as
it keeps Pace with TRUTH, and my own
Obfervations; I, therefore, hope, in fome
JVIeafure, that what h.is been advanced may
not be treated with Contempt,.by any ofmy
Readers, until they have completely invelH-
gated the. unerring Principles of this HEA-
VENLY SCIENCE : For, if the celef-
tial Bodies (as fecondary Caufes under GOD
the great and firfi Caufe,) all:uate not, nor
operate upon, fob/unary Things,. (as fome
fo!1dly imapJne;) then is the SCIENCE of
ASTROLOGY a mere Delufion; and all
thofe v·:ho fiudy ·and prall:ife it,·are no better
than a Society of Jugglers and Impofters.
I mufi needs here acknowledge, that,
fomc Years ago, I was one of thofe Enemies
to this HEAVENLY SCIENCE, who
abufe and condemn they know not what;
until foberly tempted to EXPERIENCE
a few Lines reading on the Subjeet; al-
though I do confefs it was with a ferious
Purpofe .to take up the better Occq/ion to
cond~mn and _difgrace it the more. But,.

now, being convinced of its TRUTH and
VERITY, in Thoufands of Examples, I
know not why I need be afhamed to defend
its Principles : therefore, let every Perfon
judge for himfelf; for TRUTH is what I
am determined -to adhere to, (and that,
whether I ple;ife or difpleafe,) fo long as I
remain a Member of the CREATI0 N.
The Invefiigation of this SUBLIME
SCIENCE irpparts to me how admirable is
the WORKMANSHIP OF THE AL-
MIGHTY; and fo much have I learned,
as fhews me the GREAT' GLORY ofmy
CREATOR, written in thefacred Frame
of the HEAVENS ; -while I behold their
admirable Operations and Productions, and
how the Frame of Nature hangs upon them,
and was contrived from the Beginning;
continuing and going on, as if all Things
came to pafs by CHANCE: and yet is
there- a Dependence of all Things, one
upon another, and of all SUBLUNARY
THINGS upon the HEAVENS, and of
the HEAVENS upon GOD; as if Na-
ture itfelf were nothing elfe but an artificial

Fabrick, made by the ALMIGHTY, from
the Beginning! And, now, ASTROLO-
GY is nothing elfe, but that Study, where-
by a l\Jan perceiveth the fecret Virtue of the ·
HEAVENS, and thejhining Bodies therein
contained ; and is induced, hy the more he
knows of GOD'S HANDY-WORK,. to
fpend the more Time in wondering at HIS
moft immenfe and infinite \V1snoM and
PowER ! For, the more a l\ifan attains to
know of thefe heavenly Virtues, the more he
fees of the Reafon and Manner of Nature's
Operation, in Things that are paft ; and,
the more he fees of this ReafoQ, the more
it makes him to ADMIRE HIM that made
and laid the Frame of it ! And, as he at-
tains to fee the Reafon of Things pafi, by
- th~ fame Skill he attains to fee Things to
come: and, by the Birth of a Native, he
reads in the Heayens the Native's whole
Life, and the Story thereof; as, his Bldf-

beyond the Limits of Contradiction, that
when Signs of !hort Afcenfion are occupy-

very difficult Operation to obtain the true

permit me to add, that I am perfuaded, the
true and genuine Syftem' of the if!1111ortal
PTOLEMY, is, perhaps, too lightly regard..
cd by fome modern Aftrologers. . .
In this Gentleman's Nativity, befure-
mentioned, I am clearly ofOpinion, that the
aphetical Power indifputably belong~ to
->·- Mars; for though. the Part of Fortune is
found in an hylegiacal Place, and feems con-
fequently to contend with Mars for the
Pominion, yet, it is evident that Point of
Heaven can have nothing to do in the Di-
reetions of Death ; and further, I fuall ob-
ferve, that Mars difpofes of the Moon in
this Geniture, by which Means, the proro-
gatory Virtue becomes more (lrong; he go-
verning the watery Triplicity. But, I pre-
/ume, there are fome, who will look upon
-what I have here written, to be merely ima-
ginary, and _
the Etfeet of Chance, and,
confequently, inconfiftent with REASON,

they will receive ample Information, rela-

Before I conclude my Remarks on this
extraordinary Geniture, I lhall juft beg
Leave to mention in this Place, that ·I am
very certain (according to the unerring ca:..
no:1s of Aftrology,) that the Time of D!.tth
is yet many Yea:rs diftant; for as I have b~­
fore obferved, the aphetical Dignity belongs
to Mars, and he, in his celeftial and· radical
Pofition does not meet with any direction,
fufficient to deftroy Life, for a ·long· Time
yet to come; but with Refpea te th~ Kind

to the falfe Time of Birth being fucceden~
