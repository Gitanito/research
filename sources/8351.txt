A Brief Summary of Four Near Death Experiences: 

    1.  August 1950 .  At nine months old, I was found in my crib by my nanny, Alice. I was turning blue from not breathing.  Alice wrapped me in a blanket and ran with me to the nearest main road in hopes of finding help.  There were no phones on our farm at that time.  She ran over a mile to the Farmer’s Store where Mr. Owen Farmer had just opened the General Store.  She begged Mr. Farmer for assistance as she feared I was dead.  He immediately drove us to the hospital. A German Doctor was in the emergency room teaching students about the newly developed drug, epinephrine, that was being used for severe anaphylactic shock.  He took control of the situation.  Epinephrine had not been used on a child, especially one as young as nine months old. I was revived.  The doctor wrote up a case study that was published in a Medical Journal in 1950. 

    2.  1993,  At age 14, I drowned.  I was thrown off a dock by a relative as a prank.  After running down the pier with me across his shoulder, he threw me in the lake.  I recalled screaming as I was hurled in the air.  I sharply inhaled from the shock of hitting the icy water.  I sunk like a rock and because the lake was so deep, there was no bottom to push myself back up.  My fear subsided immediately. I continued to sink in total darkness, feeling totally weightless and very calm.  I was totally at peace and in awe of how contented I felt.  Deep down in the water, a huge  light appeared that warmed my cold body and beckoned me to come toward it.  I felt satisfied, happy and protected.  I drifted off toward the Light and went to sleep.  My next memory was lying on the pier with many people standing or kneeing beside me in a panic pushing on my chest and putting their lips on mine.  I was very scared at this and began throwing up water.  Someone turned me over and began hitting me on my back.  I survived and learned to waterski that day.  I had no fear of the water and still use this amazing feeling of floating to the Light in many of my meditations.    

    3.  1980.  At age 31 during Hurricane David, I had an appendicitis.  My older sister drove me to the hospital during the hurricane. There were two nurses and one doctor in the emergency room that morning.  The doctor immediately injected me with codeine that caused me to go into anaphylactic shock.  My spirit/soul left my body and hovered over the ceiling.  I was watching the craziness of the staff during my emergency.  The doctor called for a 'Code Blue' and was immediately reminded by a nurse they were the only staff in hospital.  The hospital was on emergency power withonly three staff people.  One if the nurses dug out an epinephrine shot and stuck it in my arm.  From my view on the ceiling, I realized I had to ask for assistance from another dimension for survival.  I received the amazing gift of life from this NDE.    

    4.  2/17/2017.  At age 68, I died in my sleep. I transitioned to the New World; some people may call it rapture.  The book I have written, REBIRTH, goes into very explicit details of my astonishing journey and being in the presence of God/Source.  I explain the New Universe I saw. I explain the profound positive energy inscribed in this message I received,  'The thought that conscience is Eternal . . . changes everything.'    

    Note for researchers:  After my fourth experience, I suffered major depression because I did not want to return. Although medical doctors did not understand what I experienced, my Life Purpose needed to be completed.  

Writing my life story has been very cathartic and beneficial to help others understand Near Death Experiences.  Thank You for giving me the opportunity to assist others on their Earth Journey.
