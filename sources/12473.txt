He was diagnosed with AIDS at the age of 25, after being diagnosed with lymphoma. It took the doctors nearly three weeks after his admission to the hospital to realize he had the cancer. By this time, the tumors had spread throughout his body, and pneumonia had set in. His body was more or less shutting down as the doctors started radiation therapy and chemotherapy. He was put on dialysis and placed in the critical care unit. After his first chemotherapy treatment, his body went into shock, and he was clinically dead for a period of time. However, he was brought back.  Through a tremendous amount of courage, was able to live another year and a half.

After being stabilized and permitted to leave the hospital, he told me the following story: He knew that he had died, and he was in a dark place. Above him, there was a bright light, and he felt a strong urge to go into it, as if people were calling him to do so. But at his feet, he saw a multicolored flower, and something stronger told him to hold on to it with all his might. It was at that point, he believed, that he was brought back to life.

In the year and a half after this experience, he also felt that 'the dead' were watching him. It was not a threatening experience, he said. Rather, he just felt that he could see them, and they were watching.
