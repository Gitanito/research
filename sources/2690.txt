THE ADYAR LIBRARY
A G O L D EN JU B IL E E C E L E B R A T IO N
The Adyar Library attained its Golden Jubilee on
December 29, 1935, and on 1st January 1936 (in the midst
of the Diamond Jubilee Convention o f The Theosofihical
Society) an Adyar Library Association was formed to
extend its world-wide influence as a cultural centre.
TH E purpose of the Adyar
Library Association is to
promote the interests of the Libra­
ry along specific lines: (1) The
issue of a quarterly bulletin
to make known to the world
the kind of books available; (2)
A research staff to be attached to
the Library by making provision
for studentships, thereby encourag­
ing research in philosophy, occult
science, religion, and so on. W hat
follows is the material which Mr.
A. J. Hamerster, Joint-Director,
presented in a talk before the
Adyar Library Conference:
It was our late President, Dr.
Besant, who once pondered that
on the one hand H. P. Blavatsky
had given Theosophy to the world,
and that on the other hand, H. S.
Olcott had given The Theosophi-
cal Society, and that it was still an
open question which of these two
had given the world the greater
gift. It is true that the world
over, Colonel Olcott is best re­
membered for his gift of The
Theosophical Society, but to those
who live at Adyar, as well as to
those thousands and thousands who
yearly visit Adyar, the one great
gift of the Colonel which comes
next to that of The Theosophical
Society is surely the Adyar Lib­
rary. The Society the Colonel
did not so much consider as h
is
own creation, nor did H. P. Blavat­
sky think of the Theosophy she
gave to the world as her Theosophy
—both these were the Masters'
own, but with the Adyar Library
it was quite another thing. In his
General Report of 1890, the Presi­
dent-Founder spoke of it with the
deepest emotion as “ that child
of my brain, that hope of m
y
heart, the Adyar Library,” and w
e
cannot be less thankful to the Pre­
sident-Founder for The Theosophi­
cal Society than for the Library.
W hat would Adyar be without it?
W ould Adyar have ever become
the great central spiritual pulsing
heart and brain of The Society
all over the world, if it had not
possessed in the Adyar Library
and its books the physical receptacle
for the life-blood of the Theo­
sophical Movement, that is the
Wisdom of the Ages !
I will take you back in mind
to that time, now fifty years ago,
when Colonel Olcott laid its
foundations, by reproducing three
short passages from his Old Diary
c. L3
3
- relevant to the event. T he
tells u s:
^ ‘The Delegates to the T enth
L\ Convention began arriving
23rd December [1885] , and
unceforward poured in by every
and steamer until the 27th
tfhen the sessions began. In my
" ual address I strongly pleaded
a
flfl creation of an Oriental
fo
r d^e
T
ibrary at the Headquarters . . .
Isuggested that we should begin
^ work as a monument of the
com
pletion of our first decade . . .
A
n
d see how friends have arisen
tohelp us with their money and
influence to build up The Society
and make the Adyar Library what
1had hoped for it, before twenty
y
ea
rs have come and gone. W e
had no ancient MSS. then [in
1885], and only a couple of hun­
dred or so of books ; whereas now
[1904] we have 16,000 volumes in
thetwo beautiful libraries [rooms]
that we have opened, and the
prospect of the command of ample
m
eans in due course. W ith all the
earnestness I can express, I again
appeal to our members and sym pa­
thizersto hasten, by their individual
exertions, the day when scholars
w
ill make pilgrimages to Adyar to
study what they may make the
finest Oriental literary collection in
theworld.” 1
bet me here for a moment
freak off the Colonel’s story, to
*
*
*how far we have indeed, in the
years that have since passed, come
JPto our old leader’s expectations,
n
dfulfilled his hopes. From 1885
0 1904 or 1905, say in the first 20

pp, to The Theosophist, January 1886,

acquired 16,000 volumes. There­
fore in 1935, that is after 30 years
more, if it had grown at the same
rate, the Library should be able to
give an account of 40,000 volumes.
I am happy to be able to announce
that we have even exceeded this
figure generously, that instead of
40.000 volumes, the Adyar Library
can now actually boast of being in
possession of not less than 56,000
volumes, divided over the Eastern
and W estern sections. The Orien­
tal manuscript section contains
10.000 volumes. To this we have
to add 11,000 printed volumes
in the Eastern section, and 35,000
volumes in the W estern section.
L et us now continue with the
Colonel’s sto ry : “ On the third
day of the Convention [that
is the 29th December, 1885] a
resolution was adopted [by the
General Council] approving of
the plan suggested by the President-
Founder for the erection of a
building for the Samskrit Library
and Picture Gallery, and he was
requested to carry it out as soon
as practicable.” 2
T hat was not whispered into a
deaf m an’s ears. Neither the
Colonel’s own active, busy nature,
nor apparently the Masters’ driving
power behind, would let him rest
in peace, before he brought down,
in some way or other, the mental
idea into physical existence. And
so we read a few pages further on
in his Old Diary Leaves :
“ As we crossed the threshold of
the eleventh year, the erection of
the building for the Adyar Oriental
Library was begun at the lovely

Headquarters which had been
bought for The Society and paid
for. In my Diary of 1886 the entry
for January 1st says :
“ ‘In the name ofthe Masters and
for the sake of Their cause,' I,
Henry S. Olcott, President of The
Theosophical Society, this day
turned thefirst sodfor the Samskrit
Library and Museum at Adyar.
The only witnesses present were
T. Vijiaraghava Charlu, [F.TLS.I
(‘Ananda ’)] and two of the
gardeners. The impulse to do
it came so strongly [suddenly]
—after staking out the ground for
the building that I did not call any
of the other people in the house."
“ A very simple affair, one will
see: no speeches, no music, no
processions, no humbug of any
sort, just a real beginning of what
is meant to be a great work,
accompanied by a declaration of
the motive at bottom; one which,
though not heard by more than
two or three spectators, yet certain­
ly must have been heard and noted
in the quarter where the Wise
Ones sit and watch the actions of
ft i
men.
From the foregoing it is clear
that the Foundation Day of the
Adyar Library must be considered
the 29th December 1885, when
the resolution was passed by the
General Council at its tenth annual
meeting. The Colonel himself
thought of it in that way, for just
before the resolution was passed
he addressed the General Council
with the words that “ he had per­
fect confidence in the future of
the Library they were about to

president of The Society and the
directors of the Library have been
L some time on the watch to
achieve, if possible, what I am
c
e
rtainwas Col. Olcott’s ideal, that
jsthefinancial independence of the
4dyar Library from The Theo-
^phical Society.
O
ne of the ways to come to this
realization was the institution of
w
h
at is called Adyar Day, on 17th
February, the day of the passing
aw
ay, in 1907, of the Father of
b
oth The Theosophical Society
andThe Adyar Library, as well as
o
f the Olcott Harijan (Panchama)
Free Schools. The special con­
tributions asked for and received
o
nAdyar day are allocated by the
President in a certain proportion
tothese three institutions, accord­
ing to the urgency of their differ­
ent needs. The above-mentioned
budget of the Adyar Library for
1

6shows that we count on an in­
com
efrom this source of Rs. 1,000.
B
ut I am anxious to raise that
am
ount from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 6,000,
so that the Library may become
self-supporting, and The Society
m
ay gain Rs. 5,000 for other
branches of work.
There are other ways still of
helping the Adyar Library. I am
thinking for example of an organi­
zationall over the world, consisting
o
f a few people in every country,
finding ways and means of their
ow
n to obtain for the Library one
copy of every important book that
com
es from the press, and is
judged suitable for a central lib­
rary with a primal Theosophical
interest.
# # #
A
ll these facts and ideas were
presented by Mr. Hamerster, to
the Adyar Library Conference.
The resolutions for the formation
of an Adyar Library Association
were proposed by Dr. D. Guru-
murti, Vice-Principal of the Theo­
sophical College, Madanapalle,
who, in a fiery peroration leading
up to them, indicated that the
Rs. 6,000 needed would be raised
if one thousand members would
subscribe Rs. 6 per annum.
An earlier speaker was Dr. Srini­
vasa Murti, Director of the Adyar
Library, who visualized the day
when a University would come into
being at Adyar, “a second Nalanda,
and scholars from East and West
will throng to it in large numbers.
The vital triads of a centre of learn­
ing, whether at Alexandria in Egypt;
Nalanda, Taxila, or Benares in
India; or Paris or Oxford in
Europe are,” as he made it
clear, “ a spiritual centre, a univer­
sity and a library. These centres
of learning are all great national
institutions of international reputa­
tion, although they began as religi­
ous centres of Hinduism, Buddhism,
Islam, Protestantism or Catholi­
cism. The Theosophical Society
has been from its start an inter­
national institution; and its vital
triad will therefore be an inter­
national Spiritual Centre, an inter­
national University, and an inter­
national Library.”

III. For the furtherance of this object
the Association is :
To collect and preserve the neces­
sary books and manuscripts for
the Adyar Library;
To erect, furnish, and maintain the
required buildings for the Adyar
Library;
To publish a Quarterly Bulletin,
and such other writings and
studies as are deemed conducive
to the general object;
To establish Fellowships and
Scholarships;
To hold regular meetings and
conferences, at least once a year;
To receive and administer dona-
ions and subscriptions;
V . The A ssociation shall be adminj,
tered by a B oard, consisting of d.
President of The Theosophical Society
President, the D irector of the Adyar U
rary as V ice-P resident, and of a Secret
and Treasurer, appointed by the Presiden',
of The Theosophical Society. The Board
may co-opt other m em bers.
Explanation: The rules are kept
simple as possible. The three classes
of membership have been devised to m
ake
it possible for nearly everyone, by the
low contribution of the first class, to join
in this undertaking. N o serious finan­
cial obstacle should stand in the way of
large a contingent as possible of interests
people taking actual part in the realization
of the ideals of a spiritual centre as sketchs
by Dr. G. Srinivasa Murti. The con­
tribution of the second class of members
still held rather low, and is intended for

all those who have a more direct and1

for ; and the third class of membership is|
of course destined for those who,
favoured by fortune, wish to consecrateI
part of their worldly goods to the spiritualI
benefit of mankind. It is of course evidentI
that not all the objects mentioned undetI
