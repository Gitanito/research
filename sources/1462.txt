 Volguine (1903-1976) was a Russian Jew who became the pre-eminent French astrologer of the twentieth century.  This is properly an astrological journal but includes discussions of more occult subjects and contributions by the likes of J.H. Probst-Biraben.  In the first issue, the journal explained its program of presenting in every issue an unpublished article by Volguine,  several writings of the best contemporary astrologers on topics like "The Cabala of Astrology," "Some Cycles of the Moon," and the like, and rexts by "ancient masters."  The journal was rumored to  have intended to publish several otherwise unknown manuscript works of P.B. Randolph on astrology after World War II.  The press also published books and pamphlets by Probst-Biraben, Marc Haven, J.M. Ragon, and others.  Volguine had earlier edited Revue Francaise d'Astrologie.
