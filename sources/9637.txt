  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  I was swimming in a lake with my brothers when I decided to swim out to a stump and then back to shore. I was not a good swimmer and half way there or back I started going under. I was very frightened and then suddenly a peace came over me. I was floating in what felt like a tunnel or tube going up toward a light. The interesting thing that I still remember is that the light was so white. I felt so at peace and wanted to go to the light. My brother rescued me. I cannot today remember the fear that I must have felt from the drowning experience, but I do remember the intense pleasure from the tunnel experience.
