I swam underwater to the edge and tried to pull myself up. The ceramic tile border was slippery, and I could not get a grip on it. I was drowning. At this time, I started to see myself struggling from a perspective from below and behind me. This visualizing continued until, at the last moment, I was finally able to gain a grip, and was able to pull my head above the water.
