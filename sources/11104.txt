  		              		Experience Description   

    While suffering with a bad case of the flu, I was lying on the couch when suddenly everything went black. 

  Soon after, I found myself floating at one end of a large dark room, similar to a church or old library with no books or windows that I could see. Off to my left there was a robe or some sort of ivory gown hanging or floating on a hanger. The hanger  wasn't connected to anything. It was just suspended there. I immediately realized that I was in absolutely no pain at all. It was a wonderful feeling that I'll never forget. 

  During this time there were  'wisps' floating, that were similar to butterflies, and going past me on either side. The wisps on my right seemed to have some sort of significance but I have no idea what it was. Soon after this, I found myself in some sort of square-ish bubble. I could see the rainbow effect of it on the walls but everything around it and outside of it was black. When I looked down, I noticed that I was wearing a white gown and realized at that time that I was dead. I remember commenting to myself 'I'm dead, I really am dead,' but it didn't matter to me at all. It seemed that everything I looked at in this darkness, I could see quite plainly. I soon realized that the soft light of it seemed to be coming from me.

   I also felt a comforting hand on my right shoulder. I had no desire or reason to turn around to see who or what it was. It just wasn't necessary. Other than the hand on my shoulder, I was totally alone and there was no dialog. During this time I knew that I was travelling forward at what seemed like a normal speed in the dark of space. It felt like I was in outer space but there were no stars or planets. After a while, I have no concept of time, I began feeling a bit apprehensive. I thought, 'I need to go back, I need to go back.' Immediately, I found myself awake and back on my couch. 
  
  This has had a great effect on me and I think about it all the time. After I was over the flu and feeling well enough, I told a good friend about it and she thought that I had been touched by the hand of God. I had no idea for sure, what it was. She said to, 'Ask for a sign.' After a few weeks, I decided to do as she said and ask. While lying in bed one night going over what had happened, as I do every night, I did ask for a sign. I asked several times throughout the night and at some point during that time, I felt an overwhelming bout of vertigo or dizziness and then I saw a white flash over my left eye. It was brilliant white flash and resembled a beautiful waterfall with greenery all around it, only it wasn't really a waterfall but rays of brilliant light. It only lasted a split second, but I'm sure it was the sign I was looking for. I've never seen anything like it before or after.

   For several days after my NDE, I had a feeling of an aura around me that slowly disappeared. I have no fear of dying now and I know that when my day comes, it will be peaceful and painless. After this happened, I felt like I wanted to tell everyone I knew that dying would be a 'good' experience but kept my thoughts to myself other than telling a few close friends. 
  
  Telling my story, I have found is exhausting!    					  


Background Information:

Date NDE Occurred:   	 Jan 7, 2018  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        No.   Illness.        Illness, trauma or other condition not considered life threatening   
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

Did you feel separated from your body?      No    

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        Normal consciousness and alertness.   The feeling of being totally pain-free was exhilarating. I wanted to stay that way but at the same time it soon seemed normal.  
  
  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         While I was in the 'bubble'. I knew I was dead and I was okay with it. Also, feeling the hand on my shoulder was comforting in a strange way.  
  
Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         No     

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       The only difference was when I looked at the robe or gown in the beginning, it was difficult to completely make out exactly what it was.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I heard nothing during my experience, so I have nothing to compare it to.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain     I know that everything was dark around me during my travel time, but never really felt like it was a tunnel.  
  
Did you see any beings in your experience?         I sensed their presence  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Uncertain

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         Some unfamiliar and strange place.     I started out in a large dark hall of some sort and then found myself in some sort of bubble, floating through space in the dark.  
  
  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         A bit of confusion at first, not knowing where I was, but I soon became accustom to it. I only felt apprehensive at the end because I couldn't figure out where I/we were going. I almost wish I had continued on, to see where I was going.  
  
Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         No       

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life.   While floating through dark space, I became a bit apprehensive about where I was going. I couldn't see an end so I decided that I wanted to come back.    
  
God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Unaffiliated- Agnostic     

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I'm part of a life group at my friends church but not a church member. I want to learn more about all of this. I'm finally grasping the purpose of Jesus. Not as a God but as a wonderful spiritual human being.  

What is your religion now?         Unaffiliated- Agnostic     

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I'm not exactly sure how to answer this question.  
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I feel there is a purpose to my experience, whether it's to help people understand death or what. I don't know yet.  
  
  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   I knew that I wasn't ever alone. In the beginning there were the wisps going by me and then afterward, I knew there was someone or something with their hand on my shoulder. There was no conversation at all.  
  
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I sensed their presence  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         Uncertain   Something was with me on my journey but I have no idea who or what they were. I just knew I wasn't alone.  

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Uncertain     I knew that I wasn't alone at any time. I felt a hand on my shoulder during my travels that felt comfortable. I have no idea what or who was with me though.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.     Yes     I realized I was dead and thought it to myself a few times. There was nothing to prevent me from feeling this way.  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Moderate changes in my life.     I have always been a fairly spiritual person. But since my experience, I feel much more so and want to learn more about how to become more spiritual. Although, not necessarily religious. I believe there is a distinct difference.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I'm finding that I don't want to waste time with people who think they are the center of the universe. I am speaking my mind more than ever. Not to hurt anyone but to be heard.  

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It's almost impossible to explain a total lack of pain to someone. All I can say is it was like having a brand new, still-on-the-shelf body. Also, the fact that what was a soft light seemed to be coming from me and not anywhere else. It was only wherever I looked in the darkness that there was light.  
  
How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I remember it completely in every sense. I replay it over and over in my mind daily and nightly. Nothing has ever compared to this experience.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I told a good friend about it, about a week or so after it happened. Then I told her church life group, which was thankfully small that night.  Everyone I told seemed to be very understanding. Only one person has not really reacted either way to it. He merely listened and let it go.  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   I have read the book Proof of Heaven but other than that, nothing really. I don't think it had any affect on my experience. What I read in the book was totally different from what I experienced.  

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I couldn't figure out at first why it happened to me. I felt I had been chosen to see life after death, but no idea why. I can only say it was the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me. I truly wish everyone could have this extraordinary experience.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     Extraordinary!! I would love to go back to it but know I have to wait my turn.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I know it sounds strange but I feel like I was given a gift of knowing a small piece of life after death. If I can help someone else get through a tough time of dealing with it, then it will have even more meaning.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Not sure.
