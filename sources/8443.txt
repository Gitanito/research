&quot;...[Dr.  Rommer's] book is a major contribution, because she has     courageously ventured into  uncharted territory and produced a preliminary     roadmap giving clues to the  solution of an exciting puzzle...&quot;

At  least 13 million Americans have had a near-death experience (NDE),     according to a Gallop poll.  Data suggests that 17.7% of these are &quot;less than     positive&quot; (LTP)-experiences  that are distressing and sometimes frightening.

Dr.  Rommer, a practicing physician, personally interviewed more than 300 LTP     cases, most of whom confirmed  her hypothesis: that even the most horrifying     NDEs eventually have a  spiritual outcome.

New  Title Takes the Fear out of the Near-Death Experience

Saint  Paul, MN-On a recent episode of&nbsp;  The  Sopranos, mafioso member     Christopher Moltisanti  suffered one; TV's Walker, Texas Ranger sustained     one; Agent Dana Skully of The  X-Files had one, and even Bart Simpson has     experienced one. What do these  TV characters have in common? They've all     suffered a Less-Than-Positive  Near-Death Experience. The media inundates us     with messages about the  &quot;typical&quot; near-death experience-the long, white     tunnel, smiling, deceased  family members to greet us, and the feeling of     complete peace. But what about  those near-death experiences that are     frightening, even horrifying?&nbsp;

At  least 13 million Americans have had a near-death experience (NDE),     according to a Gallup Poll in  1997. Data suggests that 17.7% of these are     &quot;less-than-positive&quot;  (LTP)-experiences that are distressing and sometimes     frightening.&nbsp;   Dr. Barbara Rommer personally interviewed over 300     Less-Than-Positive cases, and    Blessing in Disguise: Another Side of the     Near-Death Experience   is the  result.

Dr.  Rommer   is quick to explain that even negative experiences have a     positive outcome-&quot;The  Less-Than-Positive Experience is a spiritual wake-up     call, causing the person to  stop, look back, and review past choices, &quot; says     Rommer, &quot;It can help him  or her understand the consequences of those     choices, reevaluate thought  patterns and &quot;glitches&quot; in thinking or     reasoning, and then make  necessary changes where indicated. I view it as the     ultimate learning  experience.&quot;    &nbsp;

Dr.  Barbara Rommer, M.D., has practiced Internal Medicine in Fort     Lauderdale, Florida, for over  25 years. She founded and facilitates the     South Florida chapter of the  International Association for Near-Death     studies (IANDS). She is an  engaging television speaker, having appeared on     A&amp;E's Beyond Death, 48  Hours, The Montel Williams Show, and various other     television and radio programs.
