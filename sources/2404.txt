Arthur Conan Doyle
And the Independent Direct Voice
July 7th marked the eighty-fourth anniversary of the death of one of the
movement’s great propagandists, Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle, born in
Edinburgh on May 22nd 1859 – died July 7th 1930.

CONAN DOYLE
STILL LIVES
He Makes a Gramophone
Record1
AT the Spiritualist camp,
Chesterfield, Indiana, U.S.A.,2
a seance for the direct voice
was held with the medium
James Laughton, of Detroit,3
at which the actual voice of
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was
clearly heard. Mrs. Etta
Bledsoe, one of the most
noted mediums in the United
States, who passed away
recently, also spoke.4
The
voices were so clear, distinct
and natural that it was
decided to make an effort to
record them.

1941:—http://esotericbooks.deds.nl/index.php/content/campchesterfield The most general reference on the internet is:
“In 1958, the English-born Spiritualist C. Dorreen Phillips wrote of her experiences with a medium at Camp
Chesterfield, Indiana: "In Rev. James Laughton's séances there are many Indians. They are very noisy and
appear to have great power. [...] The little guides, or doorkeepers, are usually Indian boys and girls [who act] as
messengers who help to locate the spirit friends who wish to speak with you.”

.‒Etta S. Bledsoe delivered her first public lecture when she was 16; after the death of her first husband she
married A. Scott Bledsoe. They toured the U.S.A. together for 26 years, lecturing and demonstrating until his
death in 1922. Etta continued her work with her sister Mrs Evalyne Burnside, a trumpet medium. Etta Bledsoe
died on July 5th 1940.
203
Mrs Bledsoe and Sir Arthur were consulted upon the matter and their co-
operation asked for. They were both enthusiastic and promised their
wholehearted support and assistance in any plan to spread the truths of
Spiritualism throughout the world. It is interesting to recall that during his
earth life Sir Arthur had a very high opinion of the gramophone as a means of
propagating the cause which he loved and he made a record, one of “His
Master’s Voice” series in which he told the story of how he wrote
Sherlock Holmes and then proceeded to tell of his connection with
Spiritualism and his certainty of the possibility of communion with the so-
called dead. I believe the record had a good sale.
Mr. Ralph Pressing, Editor of the “Psychic Observer,” spent a good deal of
time and effort in trying to find a recording concern broad minded enough to
entertain the “crazy idea of recording the voices of the dead.”5
He met with a
good deal of ridicule, and much sympathy for his supposed weak mindedness,
but finally a company was found to undertake the job. Accordingly a seance
was held in Buffalo, N.Y., in the rooms of the Trans-studio Recording
Corporation, on September 25th last. The mediums were James Laughton and
Mable Riffle, with six other sitters, in addition to the recording staff. The
seance was highly successful. First Mrs. Bledsoe made a double-sided ten inch
record. She was followed by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and we understand that
the pronunciation, accent, inflections of voice and phraseology are all
evidentially characteristic of the famous author. He spoke of being associated
with Sir William Crookes in Spirit Life and his whole talk was characteristic
of the living Doyle.
Mr. James Laughton is quite a young man who is earning quite a reputation
as a direct voice medium. He is the Pastor of the Church of Spiritual Harmony,
Detroit, Michigan. It was thought wise, however, to have a second medium
and Mrs. Mabel Riffle, the Secretary of the Chesterfield Spiritualist Camp,
Indiana, was persuaded to co-operate, and the seance was sponsored by the
Chesterfield Camp.6
The evening before the actual recording a trial seance was
held at the office of the “Psychic Observer,” in fact nothing was left undone
that could have been done to ensure success.
Fortunately both Etta Bledsoe and Conan Doyle were familiar with the
technique of the Microphone before they passed away, and undoubtedly this
would have helped them. The records are now obtainable from the Psychic
Observer, Lily Dale, New York, at five dollars each.
Fortunately there are gramophone records made by Sir Arthur during his
life time with which this can be compared. The Psychic Observer suggests that

issue appeared in August 1938. Later in 1957, the Pressings retired and Agnes F. Reuther became editor. A
couple of years later Tom O’Neill acquired the periodical.

this recording of the spirit voice speaking directly has never before been done.
That is not so. I believe gramophone records were made in London over ten
years ago at a direct voice seance, and at any rate, Mr. J. W. Miller recorded
quite a number of spirit voices at seances held by Mrs. McCullam, at the
International Congress in Glasgow three years ago. That, however, does not
detract from the value of the work now accomplished.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was one of the finest propagandists Great Britain
has had this century, and the production of this record is but another evidence
that his work still goes on.
Doyle has frequently given evidence through different mediums in this
country. His family have received plenty of evidence and, in fact, I have
talked with him myself at a direct voice seance, and have had many indications
of his continued interest. I am not at all surprised to hear that he has chosen
America for this exhibition of his power. After his first lecture tour in the
States I had a long conversation with him in which he compared the physical
phenomena of Spiritualism in the States, with their parallels in this country.
He then expressed the opinion that psychic phenomena were far more easily
produced in the States than here, because the atmosphere was more electrical
and contained less humidity. He was of the opinion that these conditions
accounted for the greater number of mediums for this class of phenomena in
the States. My friend, Horace Leaf,7
who has frequently toured America, holds
the same opinion.
It is good to know that Sir Arthur’s convictions are still maintained in his
new sphere of life. He had a high appreciation of mediumship provided it
rested upon an evidential basis, he had little time for platitudes. The creator of
Sherlock Holmes realised that theories were useless unless they were
supported by evidence and I can quite imagine the enthusiasm with which he
co-operated in this little scheme for upsetting the critics and placing
permanently on record the fact of his continued existence and that his fertile
mind was still engaged in propagating the cause he so ardently loved and for
which he made so many sacrifices.

Conan Doyle’s alleged spirit voice would later become better known in the Leslie
Flint séances.8
In January 1946, a few days after his thirty-fifth birthday, Flint returned
to civilian life from World War II. After a few days of getting used to civilian life, he tells us
in his autobiography Voices in the Dark, 1971; “the doors of the Temple of Light were
opened again and I resumed the work I was born to do.” It appears Flint moved into
Sydney Grove, a quiet cul-de-sac in Hendon around the mid 1930’s becoming a
centre for psychic and spiritual activity. Flint and the members of his regular circle decided
to form an association with the object of providing evidence of the continuity of life after

205
physical death by the demonstration of psychic gifts. A constitution was drawn up and a
committee was elected to conduct affairs, and they named it the Temple of Light. Pages
141-2 of Flint’s autobiography show that Doyle did not just address the circle as a
whole, but involved himself in the communications:
“At one group seance where Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding, a convinced
Spiritualist, was an honoured guest, my Cockney guide, Mickey, introduced a
young airman in these words: ‘There’s a chap here from the Air Force who wants
to get in touch with his parents. He’s so excited I don’t know if he will manage
to speak but I’ll try to help him.’ Shortly we heard the voice of the airman asking
us to contact his father and mother. He had been to see them often, he said, but
they could not see him. He told us he was killed when his plane crashed over
Norway when he was twenty years old and he was his parents’ only son. ‘Please
tell Mother I’m all right now,’ he urged, ‘she is so unhappy it is making her ill.’
No one in the group could identify this communicator so Mr Walter J. West, our
Vice-President at the Temple of Light, asked for the boy’s full name and address and
promised to get in touch with the parents if it were possible to do so. ‘Thank you so
much,’ replied the dead boy, ‘I had three Christian names, Peter William
Handford and my surname was Kite.’ He then gave an address in Grange P ark ,
north London, where he said his parents were still living. But that was not all,
Peter Kite next spoke to a man in the group saying, ‘I know you, you are M r
Tu rn e r, you took out my tooth.’ None of the other sitters knew Mr Turner was
a dentist nor did they know his name. Mr Turner said he remembered Peter Kite
coming to him for treatment some years before but he did not know he had been
killed nor even that he had joined the R.A.F.
After the seance Mr West went to Grange Park and found the house where
Peter Kite had said his parents lived. The dead boy’s mother, Mrs May Kite,
answered the door to Mr West’s ring and when she heard what he had to tell her
she readily accepted an invitation to attend a special group seance at the Temple
of Light with Peter’s father.
Because we felt Lord Dowding’s presence at the first seance had helped Flight
Lieutenant Peter Kite to manifest we invited him to be a member of the special
group at which the boy’s parents would be guests and he readily agreed to sit
with us.
Almost as soon as the light was turned off Mickey came to tell us Conan
Doyle wanted to say a few words to Mr and Mrs Kite before their son came to
speak to them. Doyle, who in his lifetime finally became convinced of
Spiritualism after years of sitting with mediums, then spoke very sympathetically
to the parents who had no knowledge of psychic matters. He explained to them
how after Peter’s plane crashed he had found himself alive in a new more subtle
body which resembled in every respect his physical body which he could see lying
motionless in the wreckage of his aircraft. At first, Doyle told the couple, their
son had been bewildered because although he could see the body which he
recognised as himself he felt so gloriously alive and well he simply did not realise
he was dead. When two peasants came to investigate the wrecked plane Peter was
puzzled when they seemed neither to see nor hear him, but soon some friends of
206
his whom he knew to be dead came to explain his new condition of life to him
and to take him to his new plane of being.
As soon as Conan Doyle had finished speaking Peter Kite excitedly greeted
his father and mother. …”

Recordings of Flint’s séances have existed for six decades or more, Doyle’s alleged voice
through one of Flint’s independent direct voice séances can be found on YouTube: “Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle Spirit Communication by Leslie Flint.” It states only that it is over forty-
five years ago (in 2012).9
Leslie Flint was a friend of Mr Noah Zerdin, one of the founders of “The Link Association of
Home Circles” in 1931.10
The object of the organisation was to bring together as many
members of Spiritualist home circles throughout the world as possible to exchange
experiences they had in their circles and to provide a common meeting ground for people of
like interests. Flint become involved with “The Link” on Saturday May 16th 1935, at
Bloomsbury’s Victoria Hall when a large direct voice séance was held with Flint as the
medium.11
Mrs. A. E. Perriman, who died in September 1936, was the first voice medium for “The Link”
who on April 28th 1934 held a large direct voice séance – Hannan Swaffer reported in
Psychic News for May 5th 1934:
“THE largest direct voice seance which, probably, has ever been held took place at
the Æolian Hall last Saturday, when “The Link,” which consists of 187 home circles,
celebrated its third anniversary by arranging that the direct voice should be micro-
phoned so that over 500 people could hear it, and with the same ease. Indeed, you
could hear better, I am told, at the back of the hall than you could on the platform.
“Mrs. A. E. Perriman, the medium, was so ill with laryngitis that she could no
more than whisper. It seems almost a miracle that she could have been used at all. In
spite of that, some of the voices were so loud that they could have been heard at the
back of the hall even without a microphone.

.‒The name Noah Zerdin 1889-1972 is well known in pioneering a general awareness and the safe practice of
physical mediumship. This form of mediumship development is primarily restricted to private home circles, but
surprisingly little information appears to be known about him, and about the formation of the Link Association
of Home Circles, which he co-founded in 1931, and which developed into an international association of home
circles, privately publishing its own monthly journal ‘The Link’. Around 1930, Noah Zerdin began to exchange
reports of his home circle with those of Harold Chibbett. Later in Light, March 21st 1931 appeared this letter:
“HOME CIRCLES – AN APPEAL: Sir,-A group of private circles, sitting for physical phenomena, would like
to get into touch with other home circles for physical phenomena, for the purpose of exchanging reports and
pooling experiences for mutual benefit. Will those interested please communicate. N ZERDIN.”
In 1931 and 1932 Harold Chibbett and Noah Zerdin held their first conferences of “The Link” when the number
of circles represented was respectively 21 and 26. H.S.W. Chibbett became Hon. Secretary.

207
“After the preliminary proceedings, during which Noah Zerdin, the founder of
“The Link,” spoke of the extraordinary growth of the movement, and I welcomed the
delegates, who came from all parts of the country, two circles were formed round the
medium on the stage. She sat in front of the microphone.
“Then, after a few minutes, we sat listening to spirit voices for nearly two and a
half hours. It was all recorded on gramophone records, nine eighteen inch records
being filled on both sides.
“Now, nearly fifty Voices were heard. Most of them had the same quality of tone.
It was explained by one of the spirit guides, who said that owing to the condition of
the medium’s own vocal chords, a special ectoplasmic “pipe” had been made for use
that night.”
Swaffer remarks on the various communications in the article for example Red Cloud spoke
to Estelle Roberts, John Myers received a communication from fellow spirit photographer:
“If you take my advice, you will have nothing more to do with tests,” said Hope,
in his old Lancashire accent. “I do not believe in them. You just carry on and try to
do the best you can for everybody. Never mind what anybody says. This is Billie
Hope of Heaven, not of Crewe.”
Swaffer continued:
“We heard from Conan Doyle and from Kingsley Doyle his son. We heard, too
from Raymond Lodge. Sir Arthur's message was one of encouragement.
“Never mind what attitude the world may show to you, “he said.” Just
put everything else behind you and carry on. I want you to know that I
have been interested in this movement, as well as many others. I hope
that this is only one gathering of many of its kind.”
Do any of these old gramophone records still exist from Psychic Observer,
and The Link?

CONAN DOYLE WAS NOT FIRST CHOICE AS LSA
PRESIDENT
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was the third choice as president of the London Spiritualist Alliance
in 1925, as the Alliance prepared to move from Holborn to their new headquarters in South
Kensington.
As noted in Psypioneer August 2011,12
Henry Withall, became vice-president when Edmund
Dawson Rogers succeeded to the presidency on the death of Stainton Moses in 1892. When
Rogers died in 1910, Withall, though disclaiming the presidency, chaired the LSA council,
and did so until a few months before his own death in 1924. For a few months in 1921, Lord
Molesworth had served as president, but quickly stepped down, and Withall had resumed the
chair.
After Withall’s death, the LSA approached Oliver Lodge by a letter from Dawson Rogers,
son of Edmund Dawson Rogers. This was the third time; Lodge had last been invited in 1916.
Lodge again declined, party through pressure of work, and partly because he feared such a
presidency would be misinterpreted. He meant that the term “Spiritualist” in the LSA title
might imply a link with Spiritualism as a religion and with the Movement in general. In fact it
was always the policy of Lodge to keep some distance from organised Spiritualism.13
Nevertheless, Lodge was an excellent friend of the LSA; he privately advised them for
example in efforts to get the law on mediumship changed in 1929, and publicly appeared on
behalf of the Alliance in the 1928 Cantlon trial, when the LSA secretary had been arrested
and charged, along with the medium Mrs Cantlon.
Having been turned down by Lodge, the LSA asked Lord Molesworth if he would serve
again, but he would not. Conan Doyle had already been approached unsuccessfully some
time before, (he considered his propaganda work more important) but this time Lady
Molesworth helped persuade him, on condition that he would not be troubled by day to day
detail.
ACD became LSA president just as they moved into their new premises, Membership stood
about 1,000 in 1925, but by the early 1930s was to pass 3,000. Readers may like to consider
why this great leap forward happened.

.‒In a 1918 interview with The Strand Magazine, [Lodge] when asked “…how Spiritualism stands today?”
tactfully and honestly replied “I can’t answer for Spiritualism. I don’t much like the word myself, except as a
term in Philosophy. In so far as Spiritualists constitute a sect, and hold religious services, I don’t belong to it and
have no sort of connection with it; though doubtless it attracts many good people.”

A NEW STATEMENT OF SPIRITISM
Jon Aizpuria “Fundamentals of
Spiritism”
Charleston, North Carolina.
2013, 330 pages.14
In numerical terms, the religio-psychic
movement following the teachings of
Allen Kardec, usually called Spiritism,
is by far the most numerous worldwide,
especially in South America. There has
not been much literature in English, as
distinct from the romance languages.
This situation is remedied by the
English translation of Los
Fundamentos del Spiritismo, 2000) by
Jon Aizpurua, a professor of
psychology in Venezuela.
Reincarnation is one of the Spiritist
fundamentals, and as well as modern
research by Stevenson and Guirdham,
Aizpurua notes the work of Kardecist
pioneers such as in France Gabriel
Delanne, who published a study of 50 cases in 1924; in Spain, Jose Maria Fernandez
Colavida, a regressionist, and Albert De Rochas in Paris who also used hypnosis.
For information on Spiritualist origins, Aizpurua relies chiefly on standard
Spiritualist sources, such as Conan Doyle History of Spiritualism which is available
in Spanish, and Emma Hardinge Modern American Spiritualism. Psypioneer readers
will know that not all their detail has stood the test of time. We look forward to
Kardecist accounts that take account of Psypioneer’s updating work.15
A curious detail is the name of the peddler at Hydesville, given here as Charles
Bryan Rosna (p.59). This full middle name, as distinct from an initial, is new to me,
and it would be good to know its origin.

Portuguese, it drew confidently from the latest work in the journal “Theosophical History”
http://bookzz.org/book/1388846/5bf94a
210
The book lacks an index, nor is there a cumulate bibliography at the end, and this is
unfortunate. We may hope this will be remedied in later editions. We have here only
scratched the surface of its wide scope. Undoubtedly the most controversial
revelation in the book is in bold type in the section on “mediumship education:”
“The Spiritist doctrine does not allow, under any circumstances, the receiving of any
remuneration whatever for the practice of mediumship.” (p171.)
Could this rule have led to the very rapid spread of the Kardecist teaching?

HORACE LEAF
Medium, lecturer, teacher, traveler, author
Horace Leaf’s F.R.G.S. (1886c-1971) contribution to Spiritualism spanned decades. He
started to contribute to the British Spiritualist press in 1907, giving his first lecture the
following year. Later he also wrote for the American press including The Progressive Thinker
which was edited and published by Mrs. M. E. Cadwallader, Chicago, Illinois.16
In The Two
Worlds, Leaf serialised circa 1912 ‘Historical Records,’ the histories of societies and
churches, and in the July 2014 issue of the ‘SNU Pioneer’ his account of the early
introduction of Spiritualism and of the formation of the first society at Keighley is
republished.
Leaf contributed another series in The Two Worlds, “Notable National and International
Personalities in Our Cause: Interviews with Prominent workers for our Movement at Home
and Abroad”. Number 4 in the series was Ronald Brailey.17
We can note below Brailey had
played a significant part in Leaf’s introduction into Spiritualism. A recent book And the Band
Played On, by Christopher Ward 2011 records the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic and
shows a photograph of Brailey’s son as one on the musicians (pianist) who perished on the
ship.
Leaf authored a number of books including What is this Spiritualism, 1918 (1919 U.S.A.),
Under the Southern Cross, 1923, and The Psychology and Development of Mediumship, (the
publication date of this book is uncertain but it is c1926,) He lectured widely at home and
abroad as a normal speaker as well as inspirational speaking, he demonstrated clairvoyance,
psychometry and also practiced healing and physical mediumship.
He was closely associated with the Marylebone Spiritualist Association, his name first
appearing in an Association programme in October 1915; in 1960 the M.S.A. changed its
name to the ‘Spiritualist Association of Great Britain’.18
Soon after James Hewat McKenzie
inaugurated the British College of Psychic Science at 59, Holland Park, in April, 1920,19
Leaf
became staff lecturer on psychology and development of mediumship. Out of this work
developed his book, The Psychology and Development of Mediumship, with McKenzie
writing the foreword. In the early 1950’s Leaf was awarded honorary membership, and
16
.‒The Progressive Thinker, a weekly journal, was founded by J. R. Francis in 1889. Mrs. Mercy Cadwallader
took charge in 1910 and continued until her death on December 24th 1935.

.‒THE LATE MR. RONALD BRAILEY:—“Mr. Brailey started his investigations into Spiritualism in 1892,
when living in Luton. Two years later, he and a few enthusiastic friends, founded the East London Spiritual
Association. He became known as a professional Medium and psychometrist of remarkable power, and he was
also in demand as a lecturer, but during the last few years his engagements as a public speaker became rarer,
owing to his failing health. He passed away on Saturday morning, the 21st ulto, after a short illness. The funeral
service was conducted by Mr. A. Vout Peters.” — Taken from Light, March 7th 1931 page 117.

housed at the Arthur Findlay College is a large bust of Horace Leaf and his typewriter.20
Below is the first of two interviews with Leaf, by Two Worlds correspondent Philip Paul,
published on October 1st 1955:
HORACE LEAF
HE paused and grasped the ornate arm of a
chair that used to be occupied by the creator
of Sherlock Holmes, the man under whose
sponsorship in 1922-23 he journeyed for
thousands of miles as a Spiritualist crusader
in the Antipodes.
“You know,” he said, “I am half-
convinced that life is a form of punishment
for misdeeds we have committed elsewhere.
We are born with a cry and die with a moan.
It is just like going to Pentonville; some
have long sentences and others shorter
ones.”
There was nothing dejected about his
acceptance of this somber yet startlingly
sensible philosophical subtlety. His smile
permitted the observation that, if the theory
were correct, age must become a measure of
the gravity of one’s sins.
“Of course,” he replied “Is it not said that those whom the gods love die young?”
Effect of religion
Realising the presence of an unasked question as to the effect of this stalwart
conception upon accepted systems of faith and worship, he elaborated.
“I do not think the world grows better for our being in it, but I think it grows more
interesting. A man who becomes religious does not become a better man for it, his
new convictions turn his interests in other directions. So you have the harsh father
and stern husband who nevertheless declare their acceptance of benevolent philoso-
phies.”
This was the Leaf taking a page from his own book: the brilliant thinker and
refulgent orator who has given so much, and still has so much to give, to
Spiritualism.
20
.‒The Arthur Findlay College:—http://www.arthurfindlaycollege.org/
213
We had strolled into the second-floor chapel of the Marylebone Spiritualist
Association’s new Belgrave Square headquarters. He was only just free from his
afternoon obligations as chairman of an investigators’ problem hour that had lasted
for two, but his questioners had clearly stimulated rather than depleted him.
Intended for ministry
A Londoner by birth, Horace Leaf was one of 11 children. His father was an artist
and a consultant on design. His mother was a fatal dreamer. A brother, Claude, was
an outstanding physical medium at 15. A Christian minister in America, he died last
year.
Horace’s early years were spent studying for the ministry following his
conversion at 14. He knew nothing of Spiritualism until he was 18 when he set out to
“put a stop to it.” His first step in this direction was to attend a meeting at his local
Spiritualist church in Hackney.
“There was a psychometry medium named Ronald Brailey there. I took another
student with me because I had a scheme which I thought would confound the
sensitive. When the trays were sent round among the audience, I gave my friend a
pocket knife to put in and I put in a key.
“My idea in doing this was that the medium might thereby contradict himself. But
when he picked up the key he said that the person who had put it in had come to
laugh and scoff but would stay to watch and pray.”
How right that obscure medium was! Since that day the scoffer-turned-Spiritualist
has visited platforms and séance rooms in 31 countries, propagating truths that turned
him from Orthodoxy.
In the beginning, he sat for development with a blind medium, but, after a short
time, she told him: “It is a pity to take your money. You have no mediumistic
faculties.”
Then the determined investigator began on his own. Almost at once there were
results, starting with physiological reactions and ending with clairvoyance and
physical mediumship. Happily, through his father’s financial generosity, he was
relieved of the need to earn a living.
The materialization séances lasted only three years before he developed heart
trouble which necessitated their cessation. By that time he was having cataleptic, out-
of-the-body experiences which often brought on a state of suspended animation. He
was constantly anxious lest someone should summon a doctor to him in the midst of
one of these experiments, for he would certainly have been certified as dead.
Adviser to Doyle
He began in the Spiritualist movement as a trance speaker and met Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle during the first war. Because of his heart condition he was not called
for active service but was given an important administrative post with the Admiralty.
214
He also acted as adviser to Conan Doyle, whom he recalls as “keen and shrewd.
People used to mistake his kindness for foolishness. He would always find out if
there was anything wrong, but he would never refer to it. It was he who warned me
that Harry Price was not trustworthy.”
Conan Doyle was shrewd enough to recognize in Leaf a perfect Spiritualist
missionary to tour Australia and New Zealand. The collections taken at Leaf’s
packed meetings in those countries contributed between £1,000 and £1,500 to the
expenses of the tour. With his expert knowledge of the subject and his intimate grasp
of human reactions – he studied psycho-pathology at London University – Leaf could
hardly have failed.
Returning to England, he took up the task of lecturing at Edinburgh College of
Psychic Science and the development of mediumship.21
He also published his
famous book “Under the Southern Cross,” parts of which are still used as a standard
work for schools. The same volume brought him nomination to fellowship of the
Royal Geographical Society.
Further travels ensued, during which he met and studied some of the world’s
finest mediums. Those who stand out in his mind are F. O. Matthews—“He was
superb and would sit under any conditions”; Frank Decker—“I saw him ‘killed’ at an
experimental séance, pronounced dead by doctors who were present, and then
resuscitated”, “Margery”—“Her séances were given in full light and she made no
conditions.”
Messages on slates
He made special mention of Laura Pruden—“About 80 years old, she gave me a
slate-writing séance in full sunlight in her flat one afternoon. When she held the
slates out at arm’s length, I heard the chalk writing underneath. When she turned the
slates up, there was an evidential message from my mother which reproduced all her
familiar errors of grammar and spelling as well as the hand-writing I knew so well.
Laura Pruden had never met my mother.”
Since those days, he has filled many books, lectures and demonstrations of his
psychic gifts with many millions of words designed to satisfy the inquirer of the truth
of a four-word sentence: Survival is a fact. No man could have done a job better.
Three years ago, he was awarded honorary membership and diploma of the
Spiritualists’ National Union. “But.” he says, “I am always a freelance.”
His last ambition
His life has held its quota of pain as well as a great measure of achievement. His
wife passed over in 1934. His only son suffered a severe brain injury during service
in the late war. Deafness besets him as a result of bomb-blast in a London air raid.
Tall, powerfully built and healthy complexioned, he is a scarred but unbeaten
warrior of whom all advocates of truth must be proud. Yet there was pathos in his

Perhaps just BCPS (British College of Psychic Science) is meant?
215
reply to an inquiry whether he possessed any unfulfilled ambition. “Yes,” he said,
with a firm farewell grip of his large but gently hand, “to be buried quietly and not to
suffer too long.”
—~§~—
Leslie Price notes:
This may or may not be the incident in which Leaf was injured, referred to in the
interview. In the letter preserved in the LSA (London Spiritualist Alliance)
Publications minute book, Leaf says nothing of any injury.
Medium’s house blitzed
In October 1940, the proprietors of the weekly newspaper LIGHT were concerned to
hear from Horace Leaf that his house in Harrow had suffered a direct hit by a high
explosive bomb, rendering it uninhabitable. Since much of Leaf’s teaching work was
carried out from his home by correspondence, this made him unable to meet his
financial obligations, and at his request LIGHT waived an advertising bill.
Leaf interviewed forty years earlier:
Mr. Horace Leaf (London).22
MR. LEAF is quite a satisfactory subject
to interview. He at once grasps the
import of a question, and replies
succinctly and ably. He wastes neither
the time of the interrogator nor his own.
Courteous in manner and sincere in
opinion. Mr. Leaf imparts a feeling of
conviction and earnestness which leaves
a sense of transparent frankness as a
leading characteristic of his nature.
Quietly seated in his consulting room
a little time was spent in amiable
converse upon things in general, when
the business of the occasion was opened
by the inquiry as to his opinions relative
to religious matters previous to his
acceptance of Spiritualism, which
elicited he following response:
“Previous to being a Spiritualist I was
an earnest Christian and actually began
training with a view to being a foreign
missionary. Losing faith in Christian
22
.‒The Two Worlds, November 26th 1915: Front page, continuing on 590-591
216
theology, I inclined strongly to Agnosticism, and finally found mental and spiritual
satisfaction in Spiritualism.
“Before entering seriously into public as a medium, speaker, and writer, I was
deeply interested in politics. Twice, at the invitation of public bodies, I contested as a
candidate for election on a London Borough Council, and was invited to do so a third
time, but preferred devoting myself to the propagation of Spiritualism.
“I developed in twelve months a degree of mediumship, etc., that won me
invitations from various Societies to occupy their platforms. I have now been
actively engaged in the Movement about eight years. My work has greatly extended,
and I have lectured, and demonstrated in various parts of England, Scotland, Ireland,
and Wales in the Cause.
“I have written extensively for several years for papers both at home and abroad. I
love my work, and realise that in Spiritualism there is not only confidence in survival
of the change called death, and the possibility of communion with the spirit world,
but a great inspiration to the study of all truth. Through it I have received great
spiritual satisfaction, and believe that when it is more widely known a great deal will
be accomplished for the general good of humanity.”
“How did you first become interested in Spiritualism?” I asked.
“Through a relation of mine attending a meeting in London, near where we were
living. She gave such a remarkable description of the clairvoyance that had been
demonstrated that I determined to witness it myself if possible. At that time I was
falling away from orthodoxy and becoming an Agnostic, and in consequence was in
a very troubled state of mind. Spiritualism I regarded as all bunkum.”
What led you to alter your opinion?
“At one of the meetings I attended a medium was giving psychometrical readings.
Trays passed round in which members of the audience, numbering between two and
three hundred, were invited to place articles for the psychometrist to deal with. I
determined to test the medium and accordingly gave an article to a friend who was
with me to put in a tray, while I put one in myself. I fully expected, if the medium
should happen to pick them up he would give contradictory delineations. In the
course of the proceedings he took up one of my articles and gave me a most
wonderful reading. Had he known me all my life, and my inmost feeling, he could
not have done better. But I shall never forget his last remark: ‘The gentleman who
put this article in would put in two to test me.’
“Later he read my other article in a way as remarkable as the former. And, mark
you, he did not ask whom the article belonged to until he had finished his remarks.”
“Regarding your own psychic powers, Mr. Leaf, were you always a medium?”
“ Up till the time I became acquainted with Spiritualism I do not remember having
had the slightest psychic experience; indeed, I was quite ignorant of the possibility of
spirit communion.”
217
“How, then, did you get your powers?”
“By sheer development. I was fortunate from the beginning. After attending
several meetings and seances, and being told more than once I was psychic. I
determined to see if it were true. Therefore, on Sunday evening I entered my
bedroom, and said aloud that if there were any spirits who could communicate with
me, I should be pleased to meet them in that room the following Wednesday at a
certain time. Needless to say, I felt rather stupid, but there was a method in my
madness. I intended sitting the two previous nights at the same time and in the
same way that I should on the Wednesday. If anything strange should happen
before the allotted time I concluded it would be due to suggestion, which might,
I thought, account for it all. At that time, you must understand I knew nothing of
physical phenomena. It was the best test I could devise under the circumstances.
I had determined to trust nobody.”
“What was the result?”
“Nothing unusual happened on the Monday and Tuesday, but on Wednesday
—the night I had arranged to meet the spirits—I had my first personal psychic
experience. Within a month I had absolute evidence of the existence of
intelligences out of the body.”
“Whom did you think they were?”
“I was unprepared then, and for a long time afterwards, to say. In time I
came to recognise them to be disembodied human beings. Like most inquirers, I
started with the assumption that they might be evil. That idea however, was
soon dissipated. I have sat in hundreds of seances with people, as well as alone,
and I have never seen anyone the worse for their interest, nor have I been
myself. On the other hand, I have seen great good spring from it.”
“What are your particular psychic gifts?”
“Clairvoyance, psychometry, and inspirational speaking. I am also a normal
speaker. Like most mediums, I have other gifts that occasionally manifest, such
as raps and materialisation. I have also healing power, and have had some
striking examples of its curative virtue. However, physical phenomena I seldom
try to obtain.”
“Is there and special reason for that?”
“I think it best—especially in the earlier days of psychic development—to
concentrate upon the unfoldment of one’s best gift or gifts. No medium can
hope to develop every kind of psychic gift. Physically, as well as psychically,
the strain would be too great. Few can hope to attain a high degree of both
physical and mental psychic power, as one usually detracts from the other.
Experience and observation have more than once proved this to me.”
218
“Is this always so throughout the psychic’s life?”
“Age makes a difference with this, as with many other things. Older
mediums may venture where those young in development should fear to tread. It
is for the instruction of the latter I speak.”
“You have probably witnessed much interesting psychic phenomena. Which do you
consider the most convincing form?”
“Physical phenomena has always impressed me more than the mental. When
produced under good conditions it requires more than an honest sceptic not to
be influenced favourably by it. I have often sat in dark materialising and
physical seances, and through them have received convincing tests. But far the
best experience I ever had in this way was materialisation in broad daylight,
with the sun shining brightly into the room. I was permitted to hold the arm, feel
the clothing, and converse with one of the forms. He gave me some information
that I did not believe to be true, and had the temerity to tell him so. But a few
days afterwards a letter from a relation of mine in America confirmed the
spirit’s statement.
“The ‘direct voice’ is undoubtedly one of the best forms of psychic
phenomena we have been blessed with. I have experienced it several times, both
privately and in circle with Mrs. Harris and Mrs. Wriedt, and cannot speak too
highly of the satisfaction I have thus received. Nothing shows so well how thin
the veil is which separates the spirit world from this. It would be of untold value
to Spiritualism if this gift were developed extensively.”
“Do you mean an improvement in mediumship is needed for the proper growth of
the Movement?”
“We can never be too good. In emphasising the importance of one form of
mediumship, I do not mean to imply that others are unimportant. We have some
wonderfully talented psychics to-day in every branch of mediumship. Probably
the ‘voices’ will never be procurable at public meetings, any more than
materialisations are. In that respect clairvoyance, psychometry, and impressions
stand alone. They are the principal cause of the success of Spiritualism publicly.
I should like to see these gifts supported much better by good public speaking.
The speaking, I fear, is not all that could be desired.”
“To what do you attribute this?”
“To lack of proper arrangements. The present Unions are doing a very
necessary work by binding Societies closer together and making the best use of
the platform material at hand. But unfortunately nothing is being done to
produce better material. Even the gaps that are being constantly made in the
ranks are not being filled.”
219
“In what way do you think this can best be done?”
“There is only one way, I think: By adopting the same method all other
successful religious bodies have had to adopt, namely, by instituting a training
college, and there educating the proper people.”
“Would not that be very expensive?”
“It cannot be done without money, but I have no doubt Spiritualists could
find that. We are not altogether poor, and many earnest Spiritualists would
willingly help if they could be sure the matter was in representative hands. It
would be some time before the full effect could be properly felt. But in one
respect it would be immediately beneficial. The mere fact that the Movement
had a common objective of so laudable a nature would encourage and bind the
members together. In a few years the primary object would be attained, and
Spiritualism rapidly assume its proper important position in the religious life of
humanity.”
“Do you mean the work of Spiritualism is religious only?”
“In the broadest sense of the term, yes, for that includes all phases of human
activity and aspiration. The failure to realise this would result in separating
Spiritualism from the common life of the people, as it has the Christian
churches. The belief in the immanence of God, so strongly established among
Spiritualists, naturally includes humanity in all its aspects.”
“What is your opinion regarding the growth of Modern Spiritualism?”
“It is phenomenal, especially since it appeals so strongly and effectively to
science. Probably no other religious movement has made such rapid headway.
But in some respects we are more indebted to outsiders than to ourselves for
this. Some important ecclesiastic or scientist testifies to the reality of psychic
phenomena, and thus interests the public in the subject. They naturally turn to
Spiritualism as the recognised exponent of these things, and I fear we fail to
hold them in most instances because our platforms are often not capable. Even
Spiritualists frequently hesitate to introduce their friends to our public meetings,
because they fear the result will be unimpressive. The consequence is thousands
of people who believe in spirit return object to the name Spiritualist.”
“Is not that because the name is not yet popular?”
“Precisely. But it ought to be popular, and I suggest it is within our power to
make it popular. Given sufficient capable and cultured public exponents of the
phenomena and philosophy, nothing can stop it becoming popular. I am
convinced this cannot be accomplished except we properly train our workers
and offer them a proper inducement.”
“You travel extensively in connection with the Movement to various parts of the
British Isles. It would be interesting to know the strongest impression that has been
made upon you concerning the public attitude towards Spiritualism.”
220
“I have been deeply impressed with the improved mental attitude that is to be
observed. From most unlikely people and in the least expected places one hears
Spiritualism spoken favourably about. I once met an eminent Ethicist in a train
in the Midlands, and I think he put the case very well when he said: ‘No well-
informed person will venture to deny the existence of psychic phenomena and
the importance of the Spiritualist Movement.’ The general public is always
greatly influenced by the intellectuals, and so from that direction among others
they incline more and more to us. The future is full of promise. I only hope that
as an organised body Spiritualists will do their utmost to turn it to the best
account.
“I have had several invitations to go abroad, notably from the United States of
America, where I was expected last year, but my home engagements were too
pressing. However, I am expecting to become acquainted with the Spiritualism in
America before long.”
Fearing to make the story of the interview too long for the space placed at its service by
the Editor, the scribe apologised to his victim, and suggested that his patience had been
sufficiently taxed for the occasion.
Mr. Leaf is evidently a worker of whom much good will come from his labours by
pen and voice. He has a keen sense of the duties of the position his ministrations have
won for him, and the wide area of his service to the Cause—which practically embraces
Great Britain—is an evidence of the success, under the guidance of the spirit world,
which has attended his labours. A pleasant couple of hours, some kindly hospitality, and a
warm hand-shake, after which the comfort of a cosy fire was exchanged for one of those
raw November mornings which Londoners know so well, and the visit was ended.—
HISTORICUS.

MRS DUNCAN:
COLLEGE WARNED ALLIANCE
The British College of Psychic Science warned the London Spiritualist Alliance well before
the start of their investigation of Mrs Duncan.23
In a letter of 14th
April 1930, the Hon.
Chairman of the BCPS wrote:
Confidential
Dear Miss Phillimore
I am instructed by my Council who think it
may be of help to you to know, that Major
Mowbray, our Research Officer, paid a special
visit to Mrs Duncan a physical medium in
Dundee, of whom you have probably heard.
He sat on two occasions but was not satisfied
with the conditions under which she was
sitting.
Yours sincerely, Rose Ch. De Crespigny.
At that time, Mowbray was already an experienced investigator, and had been to Newbiggin
to study the ectoplasmic work of Tom Lynn, as reported in Psypioneer.24
One would like to think that LSA leaders had a private discussion with him in planning their
tests of Mrs Duncan.
As reported in Psypioneer December 2013,25
his written report has not been found.

Note by LP. On September 20-21, scholars will gather from around the world for the latest
International Conference on Theosophical History. But their destination, a handsome house
between Oxford Street and Baker Street station, was not always the Theosophical
headquarters.26
THE THEOSOPHICAL HEADQUARTERS
IN LONDON, 1883-1940
Compiled from the Archives of the English Section by a Group of Workers.
(The story begins with Mr. Sinnett’s house where
the London Lodge was nourished, and includes
those used as Headquarters of the European Section
and the British Section. When other European
countries had formed themselves into National
Societies the London Headquarters became the
Headquarters of the English Section only.)
LITTLE of importance seems to have happened with
regard to The Theosophical Society in England for a
few years after it was formed in 1878. Meetings
were only held occasionally. Things began to move,
however, when Mr. Sinnett arrived in England in
April 1883.
In June of that year the British Section of The
Theosophical Society was called “The London
Lodge of The Theosophical Society.” The following
passages were written by Mr. Sinnett:
“My wife and I arrived in London in April 1883, and events began to move
rapidly in connection with the young Theosophical Society. . . .
“Miss Francesca Arundale now plays a conspicuous part in the work.27
She
and her mother were residing at 77 Elgin Crescent, Notting Hill, and while my
wife and I were still unsettled that house became the scene of continual informal
meetings of the most eager members of the young Society. Wherever we went,
rapidly making new acquaintances in London, interested inquirers gathered round
us. By this time The Society had a Council and its meetings are recorded in the
minute book. . . .
“On 31st January 1884, we moved into our new house, 7 Ladbroke Gardens.
For some time past our most interesting Theosophical gatherings had taken place
in Miss Arundale’s house in Elgin Crescent, where the most earnest members of

The Society constituted a special group though without any elaborate formalities.
We were at home, always, on Tuesday afternoons and my wife’s diary is filled
every week with long lists of our Tuesday visitors.”28
Mr. and Mrs. Sinnett developed a strong group, called the London Lodge,
chiefly from among their own friends, but when Madame Blavatsky came to live
in England in 1887 she formed another group which was chartered as the
Blavatsky Lodge in that year. The Report of the Proceedings of the First Annual
Convention contains the following words: “On the 20th October 1887, with the
change of address of Madame Blavatsky, the Lodge (Blavatsky) was transferred
to 17 Lansdowne Road, Holland Park.”29
The article by Miss Esther Bright, published in the English number of THE
THEOSOPHIST (October 1940), gives details of the life here, and at Avenue
Road after Mrs. Besant joined The Society and after Madame Blavatsky’s death.30
This was the Headquarters of the European Section as well as of Great Britain,
and remained so until 1899.
In September 1899 Mrs. Besant
received an offer for the purchase of the
lease of 19 Avenue Road. The would-be
purchaser was anxious to complete the
transfer at once, and to have possession
at quarter-day. As Mrs. Besant was
leaving for India, delay was impossible
and a temporary habitation was secured
on the second floor of 4 Langham Place,
where The Society rented two good
rooms.31
Later on, permanent accommodation
was secured at 28 Albemarle Street. The
accommodation available included a
large room on the first floor, suitable for
lectures, three excellent rooms for
members’ use as reading and
conversational rooms, two rooms for the
office and, the housekeeper’s room. The
annual rent of the new Headquarters,
including rates and taxes, was £425, but
a good proportion of this was returned in

charges for the use of the lecture-room as Blavatsky Lodge hired this room for
two evenings a week.
The following description was given in The Vahan of February 1900:
“First Floor: Lecture Hall—This room is capable of seating 110 persons
comfortably. Twice a week the Hall is rented in the evening by the Blavatsky
Lodge. It is hoped that it may often be let to members for special courses of
lectures. It is also proposed to let it to other societies for meetings and lectures.
“Drawing Room—This room is intended to be used as a strangers’ room, to
which members will be at liberty to invite visitors. On two afternoons a week this
room can be engaged by members for special receptions.
“Second Floor: Library—This will be open to members on week-days from 11
a.m. to 10 p.m. On Sundays from 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. In this room will be found the
Reference Library.
“Reading Room, in which smoking will be permitted. In this room will be
found the Lending Library.
“General Secretary’s Private Office.
“Third Floor: General Office, and Housekeeper’s room and kitchen.
“The endeavour has been to do only the ‘absolutely necessary’ in the way of
painting, papering, and generally adapting the house to serve our needs, and to do
this as economically as possible. The Committee look forward to a time when the
financial position of the Section will warrant a further outlay in this direction. As
it is, much is still lacking in the way of furniture and a variety of other things,
which will add much to the comfort and beauty of our new home when they are
obtained. To supply this deficiency the Committee are sanguine enough to hope
they may rely on individual members. A list of what is most urgently needed will
be kept in the Library, which members will be able to consult.”32
—OTWAY
CUFFE, General Secretary.
During the tenancy of the Albemarle Street Headquarters several problems seem
to have arisen. The drainage system was faulty and a good deal had to be spent on its
improvement. Legal difficulties followed the proposal that the Section should give
up the house. In April 1909 the Headquarters moved to 106 New Bond Street, but
this was not very satisfactory either, and The Vahan is full of correspondence on the
subject.
A member who joined The Society when the Headquarters was still in Albemarle
Street has given some amusing details of meetings. “There was a strange collection
of people there.
32
.‒The Vahan, Vol. IX.
225
All seemed to have strongly marked personalities, and dressed and behaved in
very original ways. There were some rather fussy, very Victorian old ladies and some
with short hair and mannish ways. The Society must have attracted a rare set of
oddities in those days. You do not see such people about now! Of course they were a
cordial and friendly group when one came to know them, however eccentric in
appearance.”
In 1911 the purchase of a site in Tavistock Square was first suggested, and a
committee was set up by Mrs. Besant to consider it. At this period she was
encouraging all Sections to own their own headquarters buildings and the erection of
the French Headquarters in Square Rapp, Paris, and of other Sectional buildings
dates from this time. In November and December 1911, the work of The Society
appears to have been carried on both at 106 New Bond Street and at 19 Tavistock
Square, a large house standing on the site purchased for the new buildings.
The following is an extract from the General Secretary’s Annual Report for 1911:
“The most important development in connection with the work has been the scheme
for the new Headquarters, set in train with almost incredible swiftness by our
President after the last Convention. Several meetings of the Executive Committee
were held to consult with her; eventually, it was decided not to burden the National
Society with the financial responsibility of the undertaking, and a small committee,
consisting of the President, Miss Bright and Mrs. Sharpe, nobly volunteered to
shoulder it, the National Society agreeing to rent accommodation in the new building
at a figure to be agreed upon, and to take over the undertaking when it was
financially a running concern. An eminently suitable site was secured off Tavistock
Square, and on September 3, 1911, the foundation-stone at the north-east corner of
the ground was laid with full Masonic honours. The sum needed for the new building
was estimated at about £50,000, and within three weeks, by the magic known to the
President she had collected in gift and promise over £25,000.
“The past year has also witnessed the removal of our Headquarters from New
Bond Street to Tavistock Square, where we have converted to our temporary use two
houses standing on the site of the future Headquarters. These afford us much more
accommodation while at the same time our rent goes to the Trustees of the new
Building Fund. The new temporary Headquarters were inaugurated with a house-
warming and a ceremony of consecration performed by Mrs. Russak.”33
The work upon this new and very magnificent building was delayed again and
again by all sorts of difficulties, including a strike of the building trades workers
in London, and finally by the war of 1914. During all this time extensive
activities were carried on at 19 and 19A Tavistock Square under a succession of
energetic General Secretaries—Mr. Wedgwood, Mrs. Sharpe, Dr. Haden-Guest,
for whom Mrs. Betts acted as deputy during his absence on war-service, Mr. G. S.
Arundale and Mr. Baillie-Weaver. The Theosophical Publishing House used the
house opposite, the Liberal Catholic Church had an oratory in Woburn Place
close by, the newly organized New Education Fellowship took No. 11 Tavistock
Square, and a vegetarian guest-house was established in the house beyond that.
33
.‒The Vahan, Vol. XXI.
226
Sunday morning devotional meetings and public lectures on Sundays and other
days were held in a temporary hutment known familiarly as “The Tin Hut”
because of its corrugated iron roof. This hut was erected on the new site to
accommodate rapidly growing audiences. Many older members will remember
the very beautiful chamber music provided at this time by Mr. John Foulds and a
group of gifted artists. Finally, during the war, the Government took over the
completed new building as a Government Office and the Headquarters was
moved to 23 Bedford Square. At the close of the war it was found that the
alterations necessary to adapt the new building to Government purposes had
rendered it unsuitable for the use of The Society. A forced sale resulted in great
disappointment and some financial loss to those who had given money to the
Building Fund.
In 1920 Mr. Baillie-Weaver wrote: “I have finally succeeded, with money
kindly advanced by supporters, in completing the purchase of 23 Bedford Square
on behalf of The Society as its new Headquarters. . . . The house is a fine one, and
much better as regards space, compactness and railway and omnibus facilities for
central London than our present premises are. It is, however, smaller, and it will
require careful consideration so as to allocate the available space to the best
advantage. It cost £4,500 and I assume, though I have not yet gone into the
figures, that from £300 to £500 will be sufficient to do it up and pay for the
additional furnishings which will be necessary.”34
The very beautiful building at 23 Bedford Square—used from 1920 to 1930 as
the National Headquarters—had much the same accommodation as the house in
Gloucester Place which is the present Headquarters, and was arranged in much
the same way. The basement was for the use of the caretakers. The ground-floor
had a members’ room where tea was served, and an enquiry room near the
entrance. The library occupied the whole of the first floor, and the offices of the
General Secretary, Treasurer, Registrar, and Publicity Department were on the
second. For some time the E. S. had a room on the. top-floor, as it had had at
Tavistock Square, but later it had its own building at 78 Lancaster Gate.
Thanks to the very great generosity of Miss Mary Dodge, The Society also had
the use of the Mortimer Halls, Mortimer Street, off Regent Street, for public lectures
and meetings, and an adjoining bookshop for the Theosophical Publishing House.
Conventions were usually held at Queen’s Hall when Mrs. Besant was in England,
and her autumn and late summer series of lectures were given there. They were
splendidly advertised and organized by Miss J. B. Chambres and the Hall was
frequently packed from floor to ceiling. The Society at that period had about 5,000
members and Miss Dodge gave a generous donation each year for publicity purposes,
so that there were four salaried National Lecturers and ample funds for advertising,
publishing free literature, and the like. Mr. Baillie-Weaver, Major Graham-Pole and
Mr. E. L. Gardner were General Secretaries during this period.35

In 1929 the financial crisis affected these large donations. Many members had
already resigned owing to Mr. Krishnamurti’s attitude to The Society, and The
Society passed through a difficult phase. An excellent offer was made for 23 Bedford
Square, the lease of which was a short one, and the Headquarters moved to 45
Lancaster Gate, near to the already established Fellowship Club, a vegetarian
guesthouse run by Fellows of The Society.
News and Notes reports: “The accommodation secured . . . is adequate and
spacious, with a very large and beautifully appointed room on the first floor for the
Library. The house is quietly situated though within a minute or two of Bayswater
Road and several bus routes and of the tube station on the Central London Railway.
It is also within a short distance of Paddington Station and the Metropolitan Railway.
Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens are close by. A considerable saving in annual
cost of upkeep will be effected by this change.”36
The opening At Home was held on
July 4, 1930.
Mortimer Hall was sold about this time and Conventions were held at various
Halls in London. Mrs. Margaret Jackson was General Secretary during this move.
The Lancaster Gate neighbourhood unfortunately proved to be too difficult to
reach to attract large public audiences, although classes were held at 78 Lancaster
Gate, the E. S. Headquarters, and many efforts were made to draw the public to the
Sunday lectures held at 96 Lancaster Gate, the premises of the International New
Thought Alliance.
In 1933 Dr. Besant died37
and it was resolved to
invite the members of The Theosophical Society in
England and the public in general to subscribe towards
the cost of the erection of a Lecture Hall in London, to
be known as the Annie Besant Memorial Hall.38
Mrs. Josephine Ransom was then General Secretary
and was indefatigable in searching for a suitable site
for this Hall. The capital funds arising from the sale of
Mortimer Hall and 23 Bedford Square were available,
and after a weary search an exceptionally good
freehold site in a central district was discovered at
12 Gloucester Place, W. 1, now, owing to a
readjustment of street numbering, No. 50.

.‒Minutes of the Executive Committee, News and Notes, October 1933.

A minute of the proceedings of the National Council runs: “The General
Secretary reported that the Executive Committee had completed the purchase of
the freehold of 12 Gloucester Place, W. 1, for a new Headquarters, with sufficient
space at the rear of the property for the erection of the Annie Besant Memorial
Hall.”39
In June of the same year, Mrs. Ransom wrote: “We are now settled in our
delightful new Headquarters, and find them very commodious, light, and when
the workmen really leave us, easy to run. We are far more centrally situated, and
even though this means more noise from the traffic, members and visitors will
find it easy to reach us, and they will receive a warm welcome.
“On the ground floor is the Enquiry Room, a small Lecture Room which will
hold about 150 quite comfortably, and the Members’ Room, looking very
charming, where teas are served every day at 4 p.m. . . . On the first floor the fine
Library occupies the whole space and is most attractive. There is now a large and
quiet Reading Room where arrangements are made for students to work. Every
effort is made to render the Library of real service to all, for it is one of the best
of its kind in London. On the second floor are to be found the offices of the
General Secretary, Treasurer, Publicity Secretary and Registrar.
“The decorations are all in white and gold and give an attractive effect of light
and space.
“As there are still many details to attend to before we are in complete working
order, we will not have our ‘House Warming’ until October 1st. Then we will
celebrate Dr. Besant’s birthday and dedicate our new home to the service of the
Masters. Our new President, Dr. Arundale, has kindly consented to do this, and I
hope as many as possible will try to be present, not only to show their interest in
Headquarters but also to greet Dr. Arundale as President.
Do remember—a cordial welcome is yours at your new Headquarters.”40
During 1934-36 the promised Hall was built at the rear of Headquarters. It is
delightfully designed in a modern style which is both simple and dignified. It
seats 400, is beautifully lighted, and is fitted with every modern facility for the
showing of films as well as for the production of concerts and small plays. The
accoustics are exceptionally good. By the use of loud speakers and extensions
into the main building Convention audiences of 650 and more can be
accommodated. Mrs. Ransom had all the wear and tear of seeing through the
troublesome details of the building of the Hall which cost £10,000, and the first
public lecture was delivered in it by Mrs. Adelaide Gardner, the present General
Secretary, on Sunday, 5 April 1936. Since then the Hall has been in constant use.
It was thought that the name originally proposed was a trifle long, so it is now
known as “Besant Hall.”
