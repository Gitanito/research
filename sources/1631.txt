THE BIBLE VINDICATED,
!}-c.
I H.AVE lately had a volume presented to
me, published by you, containing " An History of
the Mythology and a Vindication of the astrono-
mical Calculations of the Hindoos ;" also" A new
Theory of the For~ation of the Earth, &c." I
promised the friend, througb whom I first became·
acquainted with your performance, that I would
attentively peruse it, and theµ return him my
candid and unreserved opinion of its merits, he
having at the time informed me, that he had been
rendered unsettled and uneasy by its perusal ;
that his religious opinions and prejudices had
been greatly shocked by it ; and that ·much
of what he had long regarded with awe and. re-
verence, began.to assume the semblance of hypo..
crisy and fraud.
Having, according to my promise, perused your
work as attentively as I was able, I communicated
to him my opinions concerning it ; and I am sin-
cerely happy to inform you, that my view of .the
subject has, in no small degree, assisted to remove
the erroneous impressions your arguments had

produced, and has enabled him to return to the
principles of that faith, in which he has been edu-
cated from infaJlcy#
Upon his representing that many others would
be in danger of being misled, who, like himself,
implicitly believe the printed assertions of others,
which are suffered to remain uncontradicted, lHl•
les$ a refµtation of.your work were publicly at-
tempted, I have been ind»ced to offer·the public
these my. opini(>~ in the fo11Q of a letter to yo~

sun during what you call the age of Cali or horror;
when the pole of the earth, instead of, as.in:our
time, being nearly parallel .· with the. sun's a~s,
was vertical to his equator during the enormous
space of 482,000 years, " wheu theJremendous

arguments? Good . God ! to .what extraordinary
lengths will a theorist allow himself to be carried,
in support of ?- favourite and newly-di8covered
theory: because, forsooth, the Bible asserts, th'at
the first man created by Jehovah, was called by an
Hebrew name, signifying " Father of Life," must
we from thence believe that Adam, the man ·so
called, was the sun and not a human being ? And
as the third son of Adam was named in Hebrew
Seth, must he therefore be the moon, because the
Egyptian Iseth, which is nearly similar in sound,
was among that people one of the appellations·of
tbe Silvery Queen of Night 1 ·And, moreover, be-
cause the·eon of Seth was named Enos; which in
Hebrew means mortal man, must he have been
Mars, the:heathen God of War, because the wc>rd
Bnys in Greek. supposing that to be the fact, which
is somewhat similar in sound to Enos, is the God-
dess of -War? This conclusion is not certainly in
tbe highest degree logical ; it is, however, false to
say that the word Enys in Greek is the Goddess
of War-the Greek Goddess was called Boyo
(&uiv), which is much more unfike&os than your
word · Enys. This mistake must have ·ariteii
either. from· wilfulness or ignorance·; in ·ei.fber
oose it plainly shews how little dependence ought
to be 'given:to your assertions r~lative to. etymo-
logical derivations. But.as you frequently assert;
that, .in etymologies, we must be guided both by

the sound and the sense; and that,.when anhypo-
thesis is made to fit tolerably cleverly ~n..these
particulars, we are at .liberty ,to adopt it as un-
doubtedly true, the sense and sound .of a word
being the only criterio~· on such oceasiona-:-Do
pray tell .me, if you ever happened to read Dean
Swift's etymological deductions, whereinhe proves
that the. heathen gods and hero~s of antiquity
were undoubtedly of English extraction, and,. con-
sequently, that the antiquity of the English l~­
guage and the British nation, must have b~en
anterior to·the era of the author of the Iliad 1 As
a :specimen, be declares that the beautiful and
cha~e wife of H~ctor, :was the daughter of a
Scotch pedlar, from whose name .of: Andrew
Mackey (he may probably have. been your an-
cestor) .they. derived the fair matrc;>n's sirname
Andromache. I scarcely dare give y<>ti'the·exact
etymology of. Enos, whom you call Mars, but
which ought .to be written M'ars, .because, like
many of: the Dean's stories, it rather presites pn
the boundaries of decency: suffice it to say~ thJlt
Uie original.of tbis deity, was in his mortal sh4)pe
.a. very i:Jwagg~ring, blµ~tering fellow, who, wh~ll

As you lay parti~ular stress·on the history of
Abraham, I shall transcribe your account of him:. ·
exactly as I find itat page 177 of the M!Jtlwlogi!:al
Astrono~, in order that I may not be accused of
misrepresenting your meaQing.
" The story of Abraham, notwithstanding all
the endeavours of TheologiaQS to give it the ap- .
pearance Q(the history of human beings, has.pre-
served its mythological .features with an outline
easily to be recognised by every son of Ur~nia !
We have seen that the Egyptians have tlreir
harvest about the time which the S'gft passes over
. the equator; and if we go .bi.<:k to the time of
Abraham, we shall .find that the equator was in
Taurus;. the .Egyptians mus.t then have had th~ir
harvest while th~ sun was ia the Bull: .t~e bull
was, therefore, in their figurat_ive way of speak-
ing, the father of harvest. not only beca1:1se .he .
ploughed the .ground, but .because the s.u11 was.
there when they ·got in :their· lianest-

he was now ·~ore than·ever· become the bull of
life~ i. e., he was· not only Abir, the Bull, but
Abir-am or Ab'r'am, the Bull'of life, the father of
harvest"; and as their harvest was formerly -under
the direction of Iseth or ISis~ whatever belonged
to harvest was Isiac ; but the Bull, Abiram, was
the father of Isiac : and to·give this the appear-
ance of a human descent, they added to Abir the
masculin~ ~x ah;" (it was not likely they would
give a·feminille one to a bull!) ,, then it became •
Ab'rh'am, who was the ·father of Isiac, and we
actually find'this equivoque in the Hebrew history
ofAbram, whQm the Lord afterwards·called Abra-
ham, who was the father of Isaac, whose seed was
to. be as countless ·as the sand oµ the sea~shore
for multitude-even · this is truly app,licabfo to
lsiac the offspring of .Ab'rJiam, .for countless;
indeed, are the offspring of the sytlie•, and
sycklet.. But if we allow Isiac to be a.re&I
son of Ab'rah'am, we niust inquire .after his
mother. During the time that the equator is
passing through the constellation ~f the Bull in
the spring~ the bull would rise in the.East every
mom~~g in the harvest-time in 'Egypt ; 'but in tlie
poetical language of the Ancients, 'it._
woulc:I oe

of the stars, the contention of the elements, and •
the slow motion ofthe Poles. I will here in·
stance your explanation of the fable of Niobe,.
where, although you appear to have some glim-
merings as to the true meaning of the story, yet
you. cannot help straining to bend it to agree with
your hypothesis, in such a manner, as to rend~r
your solution as improbable·and·ridiculous as the
fable itself literally undersfood. The story '6£ , .
Niobe~ you declare, whose fourteen children were
destroyed by the arrows of Apollo, merely re-
ptesents the facf that the waters of the Nile;
having overflowed their banks to the height of
fourteen cubits, were afterwards dried up or de::
itroyed by the powerful rays or arrows .of ·the
sun. The solution is so far probable, and serves
to-:show, that the fable ·was in the original ·f)ighly
poetical. You proceed to establish·yorir assertion
by shewing that Ny-obe, ·in the Egyptian 'Jan~
guage, means a low country; ·and ·irso," as Egypti
through which·the 'Nile flo:ws, is a low country, it
seems clear. that the fabled Niobe is intended.to
represent Egypt suffering under the inftuence ·of
the sun, mourning the absorption of her fertilizing
waters ; and let me ask if'we do not know, even
in our:times, that the earth, in 'different· parts; i~
frequently'visit~d with qiiusual quantities a.ndcon•
tin·uance of rain, as well·as· severe and destructive
droughts? . And w'e perceiye by .the fable, that at

'Posed to such a succession of. rain; Btc., as to.be
.sufficient to raise the waters to the height offour;.
1een cubits, which was followed by a drought so
oppr.essive and of such continuanc:;e, as to cause,
perhaps, the almost.entire.absorption ofits waves.
A, calamity so. signal, and .followed by. eonse-
.quences as disastrous as unexpected, would suffi:.
ciently.authorize the .Egyptian poets to hand the
circumstance down to posterity in ·the ~ garb.of ;t.
real mother, lamenting the destruction of a real

how, .under the present.constitution of.things, the

then? Are .we t9 disbeli~ve the rea,lity of all the

.to us, without perceiving any necessity .of gi:>ing
into a remote antiquity of several hundred thott-

involves an absurdity. You begin -with' " the
setting in of the Cali-age, in the latitude of 36°; at .
which time, from the depression of the )>Ole, the
tropic:s would · be ·at 54° from ihe equator, .the
summer tropic .would coincide with ihe north
horizon:and extend up to the 72nd degree of north
aliitude~ and ,the win.ter tropic would ·coincide
with the south horizon, ·and describe a circle round ·
the south pole .to the 7~nd degree below the:&Outh

horizon; and as the tropics,· at this t~e, are -~
ceding ·froin the equafor; we'kriow ~h~t in·24,000
years, according.to the testimo~ of very ancient
observers, t~e summer tropic would.be 4° nearer
the riorth·pole; and as there are nine such steps f<>.r
t~e tropic to ascend before it would coincide with
the north pole, there would :
be nine times 24~000
years before the middle of t~eir Cali-yug, and of
course there would be .nine more such perio~s
before the end oftheir Cali-yug." In other words,
at the.commencement of the fourth age,.the:pole
of the ·earth would have approached within. 36° of
the plane of the sun's equator, and consequently
I.his age would continue till the ·pole of the earth
was depressed 36° below the plane of the suil'JJ
·equaWI", including a space, for th~ du~tion of.the
fourth age, of 432,'000 years. Now:, ·therefort},
let us consider _
the effects whiCh this situation of
the pole would produce during the continuance
of this immeDse period of time. · · ·
Such being, then, the situation of the poles at
the commencement Of the Cali.-age, no vestige .of
the sun's body would be seen above the:horizon
during the fl5th day of December, by the .inhabi-

Now as to the.fact, if it be a fa~t, with re8pect
to the waters of the German Ocean, there are
• # • •
sufficient assignable causes to be found for their
diminution, without any necessity accruing to in,..
~reas~ the .fl()ods .in the southern hemisphere ;
among others, continual absorption by the earth,
constant ex~alation by the heat of the sun, and
the original bottom of the sea being deepened by
the violence of the wind and tide11, whic~ con-
tinually throw up huge shoals,. anci,. sometimes
even islands of sand, would, in a succession of
ages, .considerably tend to lower the surface of
the water; not to mention that immense and ter-
rible vortex of the sea on the coast of Norway.,
usually denominated by geographers " the Mael-
strom,·~ into which the sea unremittingly coµtinues
to pour~ with such violence and in such prodigious
quantities, as' to b~ ,~e11~4.lflt a distance of forty

said, ir' it fail to convince, will.induce you, at

published to the world in the character of a dis.
