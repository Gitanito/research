I went to the doctor and had the gum lanced to get the infection out, then they sent me home. After I got home, I lost a lot of blood and after some hours, I went back to the hospital to the emergency room, where I was looked at and sent back home. In the elevator I fainted, (at this time nothing special happened), and I regained consciousness in a stretcher where I was being stitched up. After this, they decided I needed to stay for observation overnight. As chance would have it, I was in the same room where I had been born ten and a half years earlier. Once I was in the room, with my mother and two aunts with me, I needed to go to the bathroom. I got up; my mother really wanted to come with me, but I didn't want her to and I went in by myself. The last thing I remember is making an effort to grab the toilet paper, at which point I fainted.

Suddenly I saw myself floating (I never saw my physical body), amazed, asking myself: 'What's this? Where am I'? I was floating, without a body, but still I could move around, in short I had an 'I'. I spent some time feeling disconcerted, it was like a dream but I still remember it as being too real to be a dream. Then all of a sudden I found myself in a room, where my mother, and one of my aunts who was not in the hospital at the time, were weeping inconsolably, seated on maroon-colored, very brightly colored, armchairs. At this point, I said to myself: 'Ah, that means I'm dead!' I started to feel a peace and wellbeing, which is indescribable.

Then I saw myself going through a long, narrow passageway, at whose end I found a door with a glass panel in the top part, through which I could see a coffin, which immediately made me think it was my coffin. After this I recovered consciousness in my aunt's arms as she put me down on my bed, and my mother and other aunt went out onto the terrace, crying and scared.
