    Narratives Responses:     Narrative responses by near-death experiencers to the NDERF survey question “During your experience, did you encounter any specific information / awareness that God or a supreme being either does (or does not) exist?”


        This page contains over 300 near-death experiences (NDEs) and their narrative responses to the NDERF survey question “During your experience, did you encounter any specific information / awareness that God or a supreme being either does (or does not) exist (***experience only)?”  Narrative responses that specifically addressed this question are included.

      Methodology: 

      Experiences were scored as near-death experiences (NDEs) if they met all of the following:

  1.  A lucid, organized experience occurring at the time of a life-threatening event so severe that there is unconsciousness or clinically apparent death with an absent heartbeat.

  2.  An NDE Scale score of 7 or higher.

  3.  Shared by the individual who personally had the NDE.

  4.  Shared in non-English language via either the English version of the NDERF survey, or the foreign language translations of the NDERF survey on nderf.org.

  These are NDEs from the most recent version of the NDERF survey (nderf.org). They are sequentially shared NDEs from November 11, 2011 to April 8, 2021. All accounts were scored as NDEs if they met the above criteria and regardless of experience content to avoid bias in studying the content of the NDEs.

    The NDEs posted on the NDERF website are edited to correct obvious spelling and grammar errors. As remarkable as the NDEs are in this list, please remember that they accurately represent the real experiences of near-death experiencers (NDErs) from all walks of life and around the world.  

  We strive to make a larger collection of NDEs that include statements from NDErs about encountering God or a supreme being during their NDEs. We would be delighted to collaborate in this endeavor with anyone with other credible internet sources of NDErs discussing God/supreme being they encountered during their NDEs.

      This list is public domain and may be used by anyone.

  Substantial efforts are made to minimize the risk of posting fraudulent NDE accounts on nderf.org: See a more detailed explanation. 

  We strive for accuracy in this list. If any NDEs should not be included for any reason, please email us at nderf@nderf.org with the NDE registry number and URL. Thanks!

    Even a brief review of the NDEs below shows that NDErs often are aware of God or a supreme being during their NDEs.  The narrative responses below were directly shared on the NDERF survey and are without grammatical or spelling corrections.

I believe there is a Creator.  		  		  			6110  			Lysa NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lysa_nde.html  			The spirit woman was in charge of my destiny and I had to obey her  		  		  			6118  			Ana R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ana_r_nde_6118.html  			The emptiness and darkness confirmed a void of peace and/or God. The cross symbolized the faith that I now follow and the voice was that of Jesus.  		  		  			6119  			Shannon T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1shannon_t_nde.html  			I am now aware that God (who is undescribable, unimaginable and not human) is definetly the creator of the universe and everything within in it. Life on earth is a transition. I now believe that depending on how you lived your life here and how much you acknowledge God - determines where he will put you in the next life.  		  		  			6120  			Karen NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1karen_nde_6120.html  			Everything is part of &quot;God&quot; EVERYTHING  		  		  			6125  			Sandy D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sandy_d_nde.html  			We are God. Our spirits are one. We are all parts of the whole.  		  		  			6136  			Camryn L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1camryn_l_nde.html  			I felt that there was an enormous universal energy and that every single thing on earth had an energy and every star and cloud and every single thing had an energy and that all these things combined were the Universal energy or being and everything had a place or a form that they chose.  		  		  			6141  			Harold R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1harold_r_nde.html  			I was aware that God exists and is love.  		  		  			6151  			Jill D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jill_d_nde.html  			It's weird. What happened was that I became part of (or returned to) the presence that was so amazing. The closest analogy I can come up with is Odo in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, when he would go to his home planet and return to the collective. Only everything in the universe is part of this collective. In essence the universe IS the collective. Rather difficult to explain because it's outside the realm of human experience.  		  		  			6155  			Erinn H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1erinn_h_nde.html  			i felt Gods presence and him speaking telepathically to me  		  		  			6159  			Sue C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sue_c_nde.html  			God is everything.  		  		  			6167  			Michael L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1michael_l_nde.html  			THE INCREDIBLE LOVE I FELT AND THE MUSIC PRAISING GOD  		  		  			6178  			Ellen K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ellen_k_nde.html  			That there was an all encompassing divine source energy  		  		  			6197  			Earl M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1earl_m_nde.html  			I believe &quot;the voice&quot; I spoke of earlier was, in fact, my Creator...who could offer me a choice to stay or re-enter my life but the One who gives life? There was such a sense of familiarity, of calmness and serenity,it could have been no other...  		  		  			6200  			James N NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1james_n_nde.html  			I was told by many the light was the creator/god...and the worm was a angel giving rebirth...  		  		  			6205  			Isabel R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1isabel_r_nde.html  			I don't know if God exists the way people imagine him. Anyway, people imagine Him all different ways. But somebody has a plan. Or somebodies. Or some entity. Call it or Him God, because there is no other word.  		  		  			6213  			Shea B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1shea_b_nde.html  			Yes, I knew it was God when he spoke to me, although I told my dad, when I was back to my normal consciousness, that it was Jesus.  		  		  			6227  			Herman V NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1herman_v_nde.html  			See my comments re being held in the arms of a divine being.  		  		  			6233  			Jenneane E NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jenneane_e_nde.html  			Yes I believe the powerful love energy exists and is in all of us or rather we can be filled with that energy from the source. He is a pure form of love. Plants and animals can sense the positive energy and I can sense it. It is what makes the planet survive. I am afraid that people do not understand this and they follow human gods. I can tell the difference between a human god and the real God because I was there. I have seen the past from the beginning of man to the present time. Life is very simple. There is love and hate. The way to recognize God is by love. I believe that near death experiences should be listened to and learned from because I believe it holds the truths to our existence. We can learn a great deal from one another. I am glad to share my experiences because I feel a great overwhelming need to share spirituality with everyone. I love God deeply and I want to honor and defend Him. I get upset when people blame Him for things. They don't realize that the negative energy felt by themselves and others is a cause and effect. God put the world into motion but we control ourselves. He is always there for love but we are here to learn. When we love ourselves deeply like He does then we will understand that He lives in us. This world is a beautiful place. I love the Earth as a gift to us from God. I hope we don't destroy it and each other with hate energy.  		  		  			6243  			Dan BC NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1dan_bc_nde.html  			Only to the point that since something exists after we die there must be some kind of God or &quot;Force&quot; involved. Or so I think anyway.  		  		  			6244  			Steve L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1steve_l_nde.html  			besides the stream of consciousness ...the voice that said &quot;stay or go&quot;  		  		  			6246  			Natalie S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1natalie_s_nde.html  			In my book I describe it this way:  The one reality includes all beingness or consciousness. It is the endlessly unknowable infinity of creativity and an apparent paradox of infinite numbers of unique individuals that are simultaneously one. This encompassing connection is within and of, and creates, is created by, and moves through each unique being, and is part of all while also existing separately from what I’ll call “All That Is.”  This All That Is can be perceived simultaneously as a force and as an individual consciousness that exists within each consciousness and yet is separate from each consciousness or being. It’s what might be referred to as God, but the ideas of gods that we have are a pale and incomplete shadow of the All That Is that I perceive. Projecting an idea of a god or gods upon that infinite creative consciousness inevitably limits an understanding of the All That Is in ways that reflect the severely limited comprehension that we have of ourselves and the physical universe.  		  		  			6248  			Lois T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lois_t_nde.html  			I felt a bond to a powerful source..oneness.  		  		  			6267  			Sheila EP NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sheila_ep_nde.html  			Some form of God for sure.  		  		  			6279  			Tara S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1tara_s_nde.html  			I experienced what science calls the &quot;unified field&quot; and what I call God. I believe that I was in the presence of God (the lighted energy of divne love that I encountered).  		  		  			6280  			Cory G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1cory_g_nde.html  			Yes indeed, there is definitely a supreme being, a &quot;master plan&quot; and it's possible to know &quot;the truth&quot;. This was revealed to me but my puny Human faculties were unable to capture it all, as if a computer runs out of memory. I recall &quot;knowing&quot; everything while in this state, but lost most of it when I came back.  		  		  			6284  			Samuel C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1samuel_c_nde.html  			God definitely exists and is total love. The feeling was incredible love of one whom you would do anything for and whom would do anything for you.  		  		  			6286  			Brian G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1brian_g_nde_6286.html  			Well...I certainly believe in God, thus there was either an actuality or assumption that God was present.  		  		  			6288  			Anne N NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1anne_n_nde_6288.html  			God does Exist, He came to me. He was a presence of such supreme, unearthly love and compassion that there is no Human emotion to match it. I have no Doubt that I was in the Presence of God. I felt His Being, and I haeard his voice: He said on;ly one thing in a voice of complete tender compassion: are you too tired? and I knew He was asking me if I was ready to go with Him through the door to death. I was never afraid just in awe wonder and joy.  		  		  			6289  			Evan B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1evan_b_nde.html  			The universe was a supreme being, and I was the universe  		  		  			6292  			William W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1william_w_nde_6292.html  			God does exist. I was aware that God is not a man or women. God is everything, a pure love energy. We are god because we are one entity.  		  		  			6297  			Paula S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1paula_s_nde.html  			i felt his presence envelop me when i let the tunnel and entered into the world of light  		  		  			6336  			Bret B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1bret_b_nde.html  			it was obvious to me that I was in the presence of the Lord and we spoke to each other by our thoughts  		  		  			6343  			Rhonda R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1rhonda_r_nde.html  			I knew this love came from God. It was some of the information that the angel sent to me.  		  		  			6344  			Sheree F NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sheree_f_nde.html  			GOD was the bright light I saw.  		  		  			6356  			Mary H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1mary_h_nde.html  			Once again, God never spoke to me personally, nor did anyone really, except for the woman telling me to go back. But like above, I felt it. And that feeling is revealing in terms of God. Only God can make you feel like that, and he let me feel like that, even though it was only momentarily. I have been a believer since. Especially in my daily life. I observe so many people every single day, whom wear misery on their face's, and complaing about this and that, and getting mad about things that are so small and trivial. I am no longer like that. I am not perfect, and I'm not saying I no longer have experienced anger since, but my temperment and mentality, and problem solving is for sure increased, ten fold.  		  		  			6371  			Robyn O NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1robyn_o_nde.html  			My interpretation was of great knowledge of self and belongedness and peace and joy (etc). God is a word that works (because I don't know another), but it felt like more to me. (than I expected as a catholic)  		  		  			6372  			Arvind B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1arvind_b_nde.html  			I could feel (is it a right word, don't know) that my Goddess Kalika is there on the other side of that beam of bright light that was coming from outside the hall. I was happy to know that she is there outside. I bowed and tried to see her.  		  		  			6394  			Enrique NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1enrique_nde.html  			I know for sure that god exist..the word love was the last word I said..I later realized my wife had recently put a bible quote in the bathroom that states love is patient,love is kind ,love endures all love things..this to me was no coincidence.it is almost like god knew this was goin to happen and she was driven to place this frame there.I never payed this word love much attention.what exactly drove me to even ask god to show me how to love.since then the word love has a whole differnt more profound meaning  		  		  			6396  			Cristael B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1cristael_b_nde.html  			That was simply an 'of course' up there. There was no question about it.  		  		  			6405  			Demi B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1demi_b_nde.html  			I didn't see a God like being, I saw no beings, but was immediately aware that there was a power there that has been described as God. This energy was communicating with me and this energy gave me very specific messages. This was also the same energy that told me I had to return to my body, that I hadn't completed the things I was sent to do. I felt totally at one with this energy, it was a part of me, as if I was the energy source and was communicating with myself, but I knew it was a much higher power that I was a part of. I feel that this energy, or God like awareness is within myself and that being in the tunnel I became one with it, or somehow my spirit allowed this awareness to return to me. I knew that all knowledge was in the light and that once there I would be and know everything and was anxious to enter it, it was like going home only magnified a billion times. I was comforted, accepted, loved and I felt a total connection with the supreme energy force.  		  		  			6406  			Kathi S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kathi_s_nde.html  			The universe is one, and we all make up the supreme being.  		  		  			6409  			Sreenivasa M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sreenivasa_m_nde.html  			Can not express  		  		  			6410  			Carol S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1carol_s_nde.html  			Just a feeling of love coming from somewhere. I knew it was all ok. There must be a god. There was no end  		  		  			6428  			Chantal L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1chantal_l_nde.html  			This collective consciousness that I became part of, is God. Or that is the feeling I got. It is a state of pure energy and pure love. Everything is energy on the other side.  		  		  			6429  			Gwen J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gwen_j_nde.html  			The void was God, all is God  		  		  			6436  			HD NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1hd_nde.html  			I believe that he is there because he was talking to me.  		  		  			6440  			Carl D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1carl_d_nde.html  			someone, something is HOME, in all things, I have no words for what that power is  		  		  			6463  			Donna G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1donna_g_nde.html  			The man in the light who spoke to me was either God or God-like. He was definitely a Supreme Being.  		  		  			6464  			Marsha R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1marsha_r_nde.html  			I was uncertain that the voice was truly God, but I sensed that it was.  		  		  			6496  			Carol M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1carol_m_nde_6496.html  			Yes. I believe that the brilliant white light I encountered was probably God.  		  		  			6505  			Sandi R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sandi_r_nde.html  			He was there  		  		  			6520  			Selena E NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1selena_e_nde.html  			The light was a light of supreme LOVE and all encompassing - if this is GOD then God indeed exists  		  		  			6526  			Julia O NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1julia_o_nde.html  			Yes, because this pure love was speaking to me.  		  		  			6528  			Paul H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1paul_h_nde_6528.html  			i felt such total peace i'm open minded as to whether any spiritual presence was there or why i survived , if God or whatever God is was there and helped me i really don't know but i felt love during the experience  		  		  			6532  			Jobe S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jobe_s_nde.html  			I knew who's presence I was in so I asked Him how this is how I going to die and I asked him through my thoughts not with my voice.  		  		  			6549  			Tamara J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1tamara_j_nde.html  			I was with God and God was everything and I could see what He saw and understand what He wanted me to understand. I was shown parts of my past and how God intervened and cared for me. I was told and shown that He is always caring for me. That worry is a waste of time. That there is no condemnation. That I am going to return someday and enjoy the utter joy and peace of heaven forever.  		  		  			6557  			Barry C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1barry_c_nde_6557.html  			God loves us all absolutely. It is not like church &quot;God&quot;. God is absolute love.  		  		  			6567  			Carol V NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1carol_v_nde.html  			I experienced what GOD is. Different from all other entities I encountered, GOD is the Alpha and Omega and so perfect and saturated in LIGHT and JOY and LOVE that there is no room for anything but perfection. I have a whole chapter just describing GOD, in my book.  		  		  			6572  			Tommy P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1tommy_p_nde.html  			I say yes because all that couldn't be possible just by itself or because of ourselves.I dont believe we exist because of ourselves.  		  		  			6584  			Peter N NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1peter_n_nde_6584.html  			Think this dealt with in the main narrative. That being of light that I was with I would regard as 'God' though I wouldn't refer to it as that because the term 'God' is wholly inadequate in trying to describe what it is. I prefer to just refer to it as 'It' û this gets away from the God word and the limitations and the abuses it has been put over the years by us humans.  		  		  			6597  			Tyrone NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1tyrone_nde.html  			I felt God in the light. Even though no one said this was God.  		  		  			6604  			Ken M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ken_m_nde.html  			THERE WAS A GOODNESS ABOUT THE WHOLE THING THAT HAD TO BE FROM SOMETHING GREATER THAN ME  		  		  			6612  			Yves F NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1yves_f_nde.html  			God was in every being in the varied spectrums of the lights that were comming out of the light beings that we were in that place.  		  		  			6613  			Shannon C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1shannon_c_nde.html  			But I already knew God existed lol  		  		  			6615  			Sheryl NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sheryl_nde.html  			god is love but I always understood that, I never saw god as a being nor was I ever taught that  		  		  			6622  			Julie G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1julie_g_nde.html  			It is my interpretation that the male voice was God  		  		  			6624  			Colleen J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1colleen_j_nde.html  			I knew presence, and it was intelligent and in later years as a child expressed and described god as this light and peace and love. But definitely no &quot;human-like&quot; god, just presence. I was also 4 so didnt have the concept of &quot;god&quot; yet, so only in retrospect could I guess that the knowing presence and &quot;home&quot; feeling could be called something divine.  		  		  			6636  			Robyn NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1robyn_nde.html  			Instead of God, I will use the term Source, as it has neither masculine or feminine energy to distort the message. Source is the source, the ONE infinite consciousness. Source has one desire, to know itself. Who am I? Source cannot know itself unless it divides itself into two, thus having another perspective to see itself from. This is where polarity and expansion cycles into eternity.  		  		  			6639  			Corey L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1corey_l_nde.html  			She was bright and I felt her love immediately (and yes God is a female) She looked like the sun- with love coming off of her in rays (it's hard to explain- but she reminded me of a painting of the sun I saw when I was very young- with light illuminating off of her body in the center). She hugged me and she was suddenly gone.  		  		  			6660  			Jeffery O NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jeffery_o_nde.html  			I experienced what I call God. He was with me. I knew Him.  		  		  			6664  			Helen E NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1helen_e_nde.html  			i was somewhere and that somewhere i would consider God(ess)  		  		  			6665  			Hannah NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1hannah_nde_6665.html  			God is the being that is there to reassure us when we die and explain what is.happening and that we have a higher purpose than our life on earth  		  		  			6667  			Gary NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gary_nde.html  			Nothing identified itself as God, but the place I was in was clearly created by something.  		  		  			6672  			Annette Q NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1annette_q_nde.html  			I was aware of his presence. I was drawn to the light, but knew in my heart i had to go back to my children. He cam to me as an definite awareness of being and i asked Him to go back to my children. I know He is God of no denomination. The supreme being.  		  		  			6678  			Miles NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1miles_nde.html  			I believe I experienced the presence of what appeared to be our physical Christ.

We are sent here with our divine creative abilities to enjoy our existence, planning our lives (reade 'roles,' in advance, with other parts of the design soul.) This is for our amusement, as well of the as the God part of us that shares this body with this, and runs its two or 3 trillion cells, as our monkey mind plays its fun and games.  		  		  			7747  			Jeanne MK NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jeanne_mk_nde.html  			definitely That should answer your question  		  		  			7771  			GaeLawree C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gaelawree_c_nde.html  			I do believe God exists!

God Himself is love and communicates this incredible all encompassing love. He holds back nothing and wants us to tell everyone how very much He loves them. The warmth and the light are incredible. In His presence you understand everything and feel no shame. An incredible compassion is communicated! I could not have begun to make something up like this in my physical mind. everything i heard saw and learned changed my perspective of who God is and how I am to live in this physical earth suit.  		  		  			8039  			Pedro Z NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1pedro_z_nde.html  			It is everything, we are part of it and it is in us  		  		  			8051  			Jaime NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jaime_nde.html  			My angels were clearly waiting for an answer from a higher power.  		  		  			8055  			Maria P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1maria_p_nde.html  			I KNEW that I was embraced by God, in God, of God in the form of Light.  		  		  			8064  			Randy G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1randy_g_nde.html  			I'm positive that it was god that spoke to me  		  		  			8078  			Kohn A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kohn_a_nde.html  			I felt a great presence .  		  		  			8083  			Robin L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1robin_l_nde.html  			The Great all emcompassing Heart of which we can be a direct expression or through free will choose willfullness.  		  		  			8085  			Nathan L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1nathan_l_nde.html  			I immediately understood that God is Love and my faith is necc for my family.  		  		  			8092  			Ladli S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ladli_s_nde.html  			Yes I felt that face....it is everything....the force behind everything  		  		  			8131  			Andy J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1andy_j_nde.html  			I felt a definite presence of a completely peaceful force.

And in fact perhaps it did reveal its form, perhaos its form is pure love  		  		  			8141  			Karen M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1karen_m_nde_8141.html  			I knew God and was very aware of God's presence and existence as separate from me and as part of me.  		  		  			8147  			Kathryn Y NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kathryn_y_nde.html  			Yes….God…..as a state of higher consciousness- one love- one being!  		  		  			8151  			Jeremy NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jeremy_nde.html  			I was absolutely aware that God was watching and close.

I did not feel any other spiritual force or awareness of that. I won't go as far as to say that there is no God, but if I were to base my answer to is there one God based solely on my experience alone, I would say 'no'. I say this because, during that experience, it didn't seem important. I felt that I was important and not some supreme being. I feel like that idea of God is based on our earthy desires and fears and not in any kind of actual truth.  		  		  			8195  			William C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1william_c_nde.html  			While in the presence of the light i understood that all life is eternal because we are all connected. We are a collective consciousness. We merely transform into another dimension. This life is all about love because once we are in the presence of god love is the only emotion. Love is god's chosen emotion. Love is really greater than an emotion but for the purpose and confines of language i will refer to love as an emotion.  		  		  			8213  			Katherine L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1katherine_l_nde.html  			I communicated with an ascended master who I believed was closer to God than the other beings there, so I must have had some knowledge at the time that God existed.  		  		  			8216  			Kustav K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kustav_k_nde.html  			It could be that the voice I heard was God.  		  		  			8225  			Debra H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1debra_h_nde.html  			I definitely knew that The Love is God.  		  		  			8249  			Dana M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1dana_m_nde.html  			I did not correlate the love and acceptance and warmth of the experience with a God-like entity. I think I was too young to understand God as a concept. Only as I've matured have I come to the understanding that The Great Center was present on that beach, not as one of the beings with me, but all around us there, caring for and wanting the best for all of us.  		  		  			8250  			Karen T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1karen_t_nde.html  			I have only awareness that God was the creator of all that I was encountering.  		  		  			8251  			Susanne S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1susanne_s_nde.html  			saw it.  		  		  			8259  			Amy C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1amy_c_nde_8259.html  			It was an awareness. It just was. It was a certainty where you just knew ok this is how it is. As sure as feeling a rain drop let's you know it's raining.  		  		  			8266  			Derek L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1derek_l_nde.html  			I felt like the light was the light of God.  		  		  			8268  			C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1c_nde_8268.html  			I felt the existance of God.  		  		  			8282  			Jennifer B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jennifer_b_nde_8282.html  			I call it the source.

I think to be reborn.  		  		  			8284  			Halil T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1halil_t_nde.html  			I know He exists, I heard His voice, and saw religious imagery significant with my faith.  		  		  			8295  			Cortney P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1cortney_p_nde.html  			Yes, and this supreme being has been called many things.

God is Pure Light. God is 'larger than religion'. 'God is 'larger than Earth and Earth's culture'. God is Science, all knowledge/intelligence and beyond description. God loves us more than we can imagine.  		  		  			8341  			Stacy K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1stacy_k_nde.html  			God was with me during my experience  		  		  			8342  			PJ P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1pj_p_nde.html  			It is love, that is the only answer. Everything that isn't love isn't creating but destroying.   		  		  			8350  			Aaron M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1aaron_m_nde.html  			I could see and feel and became one with a higher energy that is much greater than anything ever experienced. It taught me everything there was to know about existence. It did not call itself god or a higher being. It did not really name itself at all. But i am sure it was comparable to god - though it was not a man and it was somehow one thing and thousands (maybe millions) of things all at once.  		  		  			8354  			Heidi C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1heidi_c_nde.html  			I was surround by God. The light is Love. The Light is God. We are all connected. We are all one.  		  		  			8362  			Dyan K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1dyan_k_nde.html  			I know there is a God now - He held me in his arms and made me understand the word awesome.  		  		  			8380  			Missy M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1missy_m_nde.html  			I saw Jesus from a distance, he spoke to me in a sense, more like thought. He touched me, but I didn't feel a physical touch, only love. God was all around me. GOD REALLY IS LOVE.  		  		  			8422  			Doug F NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1doug_f_nde.html  			Everything is god. I would not use the word god, but it answers your question  		  		  			8440  			Ingrid H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ingrid_h_nde.html  			I didn't know the meaning of God before the NDE, but during the NDE I experienced absolute bliss, love and joy beyond anything I had ever experienced in my human form and that is what I recognize as God.  		  		  			8454  			Robyn C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1robyn_c_nde.html  			I could sense there was a force or God or energy and that was where I was heading to  		  		  			8460  			Jeri W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jeri_w_nde.html  			A feeling of an all-encompassing something. I call it a higher power. God/supreme being doesn't sound/feel right. It's close but not correct, if that makes any sense. There's almost a sense of humor... there is this thing, and we are all part of it, and so it is amusing when we talk about it as separate to ourselves, when we are intrinsic to it.  		  		  			8466  			Lynn Z NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lynn_z_nde.html  			Again, it wasn't communicated to me as such, but I for sure felt that the person made of love was much, much, much superior to me, if He not the Creator or God Himself.  		  		  			8508  			Judie S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1judie_s_nde.html  			There was a presence felt that was a higher being.  		  		  			8509  			Linda A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1linda_a_nde.html  			I could feel God's presence! His love. The light. The laughter.  		  		  			8525  			Laurie L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1laurie_l_nde.html  			I believe I met my guardian angel, and two archangels during my NDE. I felt the presence of God all around me.  		  		  			8533  			Bridget B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1bridget_b_nde.html  			I was able to meet God and speak to GOD... as stated in my entire story  		  		  			8543  			Michael L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1michael_l_nde_8543.html  			I felt like I 'knew' everything for just an instant. I realized then that God is 'Knowing'. That's the only way I could have described it at that time, but I knew with my whole being that a Supreme Force of some kind existed.  		  		  			8545  			James R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1james_r_nde_8545.html  			I was aware of who I call God or should I say came to me as God but not in the Biblical since.  		  		  			8556  			Evelyn D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1evelyn_d_nde.html  			If asked, I would say that God is Light. An all knowing, ever present, eternal Light that permeates all of creation.  		  		  			8558  			Samia NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1samia_nde.html  			I think I saw the light of God himself  		  		  			8559  			Jeff H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jeff_h_nde.html  			I feel that our religious concept of what God is, might be off a little. I really get the feeling that God is where we all come from, but I don't know if I can accurately define what God is, or is not.  		  		  			8562  			Richard G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1richard_g_nde_8562.html  			I felt the Presence that sent me an incredible love and at the same time treated me equally and not as somebody of lower class.  		  		  			8583  			Daphne B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1daphne_b_nde.html  			I figured that the voice in my head that asked me who I wanted to be was my God.  		  		  			8588  			Anne L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1anne_l_nde_8588.html  			I knew the voice I heard was God  		  		  			8596  			Anthony M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1anthony_m_nde_8596.html  			I felt like I was moving toward a place I would be continuing to live another life in unison with others under the guidance of a supreme being  		  		  			8600  			Van S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1van_s_nde.html  			A figure sitting on a throne no fear addressing me  		  		  			8603  			Douglas B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1douglas_b_nde.html  			I also had the feeling, but never heard it read, that all the events of my life had been read, and were known. Through this I felt no fear, or uncertainty, just a complete sense of calm, as I heard, and saw the words passing before me. I don’t recall all the scripture I saw before me, but I do recall seeing the Gospel of John, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God…”  		  		  			8604  			Alma B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1alma_b_nde.html  			What can I say.

But it all felt like stepping into the Oneness - The heart of the Universe - perhaps another name for God.  		  		  			8718  			Laurence B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1laurence_b_nde.html  			I felt three distinct being and more of a place. One was the presence of God, the second was Jesus and the third was the teacher of guide but much bigger telling me to go back.  		  		  			8724  			Telesa H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1telesa_h_nde.html  			All life begins with a spark from the central source...

I saw Jesus sitting next to God. Although I did not see God since there was a white round cloud in front of Him, I could see His side and back. They were both sitting on large, white, tall back chairs.  		  		  			9017  			Michael NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1michael_nde_9017.html  			The existence of God is more realistic than the pain I was suffering from.  		  		  			9029  			Melinda G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1melinda_g_nde.html  			God is all.

He is real. I was a total unbeliever prior to this. Know I am what I like to call a 'knower'. That is to mean I haven't faith that he exists... I KNOW he exists because I've met him as clear as when you go outside and met your neighbor. You do not have faith your neighbor exists.
