It was 12/03/1990 and I was coming back from school. When I reached our house in the village, I started having these weird hallucinations and I fell, hitting a rock directly on my head. I passed out. Here is where it began. I lifted out of my body and something pushed me into a weird place. It was like a magnet pushing me there. I then saw someone who was dead. My grandfather. He said, ‘To the stars’. I got pushed by that force and fell on my knees. Free of that power, I fell into a weird city that looked like a very ruined version of earth. I then noticed it was earth. But earth during World War 3. Everything was rubble but thank God, it was only in one continent that was blown up. That was Europe. I then heard voices explaining how the savior of this event will be born in 2001 on this exact date in Canada. He too would be a Sikh. I awoke in the hospital and the doctor said that I had just died and was now alive. No one believed my incident except the doctors and my family.
