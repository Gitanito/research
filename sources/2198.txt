PREFACE.
·MANY of the readers of Emanuel
. Swedenborg having.exprdfed a·ftrong
defire to fee a DiElionary efCorrefpondences.
·&c. and believing that fuch"a wot:k migh;
prove highly ufeful and acceptable to every
·member of the New Church. I was in-
duced to compile the prefent vol!-Jme,
which contains about· three thoufand cor-
refpondences, fpirirual fignifications. of
words, and explanations of difficult paf-
fages of fcripture, all arranged in aJpha-
betical order, and for the moft part havjng
the authorities arinexed to each article.
The nature and importance of the fd.,.
ence of correfpondences, which is the only
true key to the fpiritual fenfe of the holy
Word, being already fuffidently pointed
out in the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg.
it is unneceffary in this place to fay much
in recommendation of the ftudy of that
fublime fcience. I fhall therefore content
myfelf with· referring the reader, for full -
information on this matter, to the 'l'rue
Cbri/iian Religion, n. 123 to 209; and tile
Treatife <>n Heaven and He!IJ. n. 87 · t~

iv PREFACE.
As the difference between correfpond-
f'nce and mere figure or metaphor has not
been fufficiently attended to, but they arc
co~fidered by man} as fynonimous, I {hall
here. tranfcribe from R. Hindmaifh's ~ellers
to Dr. Prieflley, p. 2 81, &c. what is there
advanced on this fubjc&. · ·
"CorrefpondLnCe in general may be de-
fined, the relation fuhfifling between the
etr~nce of a thing and it's form, or be-
tween the caufe and it•s .elfett ; thus the
whole natural world correfponds to the ..
fpiritual world; the .body of a man, with
all it's parts, correfponds to his foul ; and
the literal fenfe ofthe Word correfponds to
it's fpiritual fenfe. So that wherever there
is a correfpondence, there is neceffarily
implied fuch an union between two things,
as only takes place when the one is derived
from the other, in the fame manner as an
effecl is derived from it's efficient caufe, or
as fpeech is derived from thought, and the
gdtures of the body from the atfcchons of
the mind; in all which cafes the exterior
forms can no more be feparated from the
interior efft:nces, without lofing their exift-
ence, than the body of a man can be fepa-
rated from his foul without death. Such
is the nature and power of correfpondences.
Let us now fee whether the fame may be
faid of mere figure and metaphor.

"' ,o,,Googk
PREFACE. v
"A mere figure or metaphor is the Te-
femblance, in fome certain way, which one
thing bears to another, not according to
the true nature and. firnefs of things, fo
much as by the arbitrary choice ofa fpeaker
or writer, who is ·defirous ofilluflrating his
fubjeCl:, ,and rendering it familiar to the
comprehenfion. Confequemly there is no
neceffary union between the fubjed and the
figure, nor is the one an effeet of the other,
. or in any wife dependent on it for it's
exi!lence and fubfiftence, as is the cafe in
all correfpondences. An example will il-
luftrate the truth ofmy obfervation. Virgil;
in his lEneid, lib. ii. likens the deftrutl:ion
of Troy, with her lofty fpires, to the·fall of
an aged oak, on being hewn down by the
woodman's hatchet. This is a fimile, or
figure, but not a correfpondence; for there
is no neceffary conneccion between the city
of Troy and a mountain oak, nor between
her lofty fplres and the wide extending
branches of a tree. The 011e is not •within
· the other, as it's life and foul; n~r can the
rclationfhip fubfifting between. them be
confidered like that of caufe and effeCl:, ef..
fence and form, prior and pofieriol'; foul
and body, which neverthelefs, as before·
obferved, is the cafc with all true corre-
fpondenccs,
"The
o,.,,.ob,Googk
vi PREFACE.
cc The difference between a mere figure
andacorrefpondence mayagainappt"arfrom
the following confideration. A mere figure
'Or fimile is the refemblance which one na'-
tural objed: or circumftance is fuppofed to
bear to another natural object or circum-
ftance; whereas a correfpondence is the
adual relation fubfifting between a natural
objcd: arid afpirit11al fubjetl:, or a natural
form and a fpiritu11/ effence ; that is, be-
tween 011/er and inner, lower and higher, na-
ture andfpiril, and not between nature and
nature, or.fpirit and.fpirit. This di.ftinc-
tidh fuould be well attended to. The lan-
guage of correfpondences is the language
of God himfelf, being that in which he .
always fpeaks, both in his Word and in his
works: but figure and metaphor, together
with the language of fable, are the mere
inventions of man, which took thdr rife
when the divine fcience ofcorrefpondences
began to be loft in the world.,''-See th~
Preface to the Hieroglyphic Key.
This being the firft DIE1io11ary of Cor-
refpondenret publifhed in the Englifh lan-
guage, the reader muft not expect to find it
a complete or perfect work; for it is only
intended as a fmall portable affiftant to
. thofe who arc defirous of improving them-
felves in the fcience of correfpondences.
Jt,is ttue, indeed, that in the Magazine of

a work of this kind was firft undertaken
by R. Hind_marjh; but as the publication of
that Magazine ceafed with the 20th Num-
ber. the ddign of completing the Dic-
tionary was alfo given up. The fubftancc,
however, of what was there collected frOJll
the writings of Emanuel ·Swedenhorg is
brought into the prefent volume; and
notwithftanding references are. frequently
made to thac work, as well as to the.Letters ·
to Dr. Pri1Jley, as though they were of
like authority with the writings of Emanuel
Swedeizborg, yet the.reader is particularly
reque.fted to obferve, that no dependence
ought to be placed on thofe works any
further than as they'may be found in per-
feet agreement with the above-mentioned
author, who alone (under the Lord) will
ever be confidercd as the great oracle of
the New Church. .

contribute my mite. As a fincere ad-
mirer, and in fome fmall degree a pro-
moter of it's doctrines, I hope I may be

glorified his own h1;1-manity. Arr. 3043•

truths. 'Theo/. 618, 619, 620.
Regeneration. There are two ftates
through which a man paifeth to rege-

truth to good; the fecond is when good..
nefs becometh his firft and active prin..
ciple; and enableth him to difcer.n truth.
