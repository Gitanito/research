I was still comatose, and I was watching it from the left upper corner of the room. When I described it to my father several years later, he went white - I had exactly described the angiogram: the description of the machinery was accurate, the people at the foot of the bed were doctors, and my father was the one holding my hand.

The angiogram was intended to pinpoint the abscess - I had been in a coma for four weeks, and an electroencephalogram the night before had shown a somewhat fuzzy outline of the abscess. My parents had been told that without surgery, I would either die or be left a vegetable - if the abscess opened, it would open quickly and overwhelm my system. But overnight, the abscess literally disappeared - when the results of the angiogram came back, the abscess was gone. Needless to say, I survived, and I went on to graduate from law school.
