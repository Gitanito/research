I following your work for a lot of years
and particularly that video that you put
out for heard some people that work for
the government they all stood up at the
podium and they spoke about Buzz Aldrin
he died back in November he put the
article at but his death how his family
couldn&#39;t speak about oh I think that was
Neil Armstrong actually the first man
Walton moon exactly and you said that
when he when he landed he saw something
that he couldn&#39;t talk about yes so this
is a really great question about what
really happened you might my uncle work
for Grumman that became north of Grumman
and Grumman had the contract to build
the lunar module it landed funny-looking
thing that looked like a spider it
landed on the moon in 1969 on July 20th
or whatever it was the first man on the
first two men on the moon were Neil
Armstrong and after him Buzz Aldrin and
back when we were doing these briefings
for Congress and in fact even before
then the Asilomar gathering 1995 we
reached out to Neil Armstrong because I
knew from contacts and family that when
we landed on the moon we weren&#39;t alone
and that but that Neil Armstrong there
were two people who&#39;ve been on my team
for many years who are good friends of
his family and so we reached out to him
and invited him to come to those events
and he politely declined and that would
told us that that he it made was made
very clear to him and the other Apollo
astronauts who witnessed this first
event where when we landed at the crater
on the moon above the rim at the top of
the crater was quote crowded with UFOs
craft that were up there multiple of
them and that these were filmed and that
there are I know people personally who
have seen that film
footage and that that&#39;s why the film
footage that came back to the earth they
and we did go to the moon but some of
the footage it doesn&#39;t make sense
because the flag is moving now the
reason for that and this where people
say we didn&#39;t go to the moon it was all
hoax and filmed in a basement up in New
York the truth is we went but during the
lunar orbiter going back before the
Apollo mission we actually were circling
the earth taking the first early digital
photographs and as you know from the
testimony of disclosure project witness
Carl wrote wolf there were structures on
the moon that were artificial some were
newer and some were very ancient and so
they knew the covert programs and these
images were being downloaded to out here
at Langley not the CIA headquarters
Langley Air Force Base to a compartment
at operation run by the National
Security Agency that was then
sequestered away from the other NASA
scientists but the people running that
project to deep black people and those
projects knew that it was likely we were
going to encounter something not of this
world or a UFO when we landed therefore
they had filmed some footage that they
could splice in if something started
happening so during the live
transmission if something started
happened there could be a there&#39;s a
delay that would go went through this
National Security Agency filter and they
could quick immediately instantly clip
put in and that&#39;s why there&#39;s a couple
frames where the American flag is moving
well there&#39;s no atmosphere on the moon
okay which was the one mistake they made
in that whole plan that&#39;s the telltale
giveaway now some people have taken that
the conspiracy theorists have said we
didn&#39;t even go to the moon we did go to
the moon but they knew that it was
likely there were going to be II TVs
extraterrestrial vehicles up there and
so when they stepped out of course you
know and we&#39;re approaching actually
before they even landed they saw them so
they were already with this sort of pre
prepared film that that was looked very
very good except for this one error and
so Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin know
for a fact now Neil Armstrong said look
you know if I were to go forward and
talk about what actually happened it&#39;s
been I&#39;ve been told Neil Armstrong has
said this to us that my me my wife my
children and my grandchildren would all
be killed that they would take us out
somehow
it&#39;s a terrible accident he says I&#39;m not
going to talk about it now Buzz Aldrin
has just basically you he sort of had a
nervous breakdown after this and was
actually at an Air Force facility I know
a man that was there with him and he
confided that this is also what happened
I also know Buzz Aldrin sister who
pulled me aside and says yes that you&#39;re
absolutely right that is what happened
but it&#39;s not my job to out Buzz Aldrin
on this if he&#39;s ready and he&#39;s able and
allowed he will speak about it but you
have to understand enormous pressure was
put on these men never to speak about
what actually happened and this is a the
following question were those ships that
were around the moon at that time in
1969
extraterrestrial or man-made of
reproduction vehicles using anti-gravity
I don&#39;t know it could have been either
but I think probably they weren&#39;t ours
only because those folks would not have
wanted to risk exposing that they were
there with cameras rolling okay because
that would have ended the fact that they
have the secret aircraft a secret space
force so that&#39;s that&#39;s one of the
problems that&#39;s you know I&#39;ve thought
about it and the answer is I don&#39;t know
but from a logical point of view I doubt
it was ours okay now you know now one of
the things that Neil Armstrong was
overheard saying and this was reported
in Timothy
above top-secret is that Neil Armstrong
stated that we were essentially warned
off the moon that in other words these
civilizations did not want us going to
other moons or planets to colonize them
with the consciousness of nationalism
and the Cold War because remember the
Apollo project was really a proxy for
the Cold War the United States was in a
complete panic when Sputnik overtook our
space program the Soviets and so the
race to the moon was part of and always
was part of the military competition
between two huge superpowers old Soviet
Union and the United States of America
and so when we went there but we went
there not as a peaceful world
civilization but as a competing Cold War
effort where that were armed with
thousands of thermonuclear weapons
hydrogen bombs pointed at each other
that was not the consciousness that the
ETS want to see us going into space with
they want us going into into space with
the consciousness of peace and
cooperation not militarism and war so
that&#39;s sort of your let&#39;s say if there&#39;s
an entry ticket to space exploration
that&#39;s the main one and we haven&#39;t quite
reached that point that way so I think
that&#39;s why Neil Armstrong said what I
don&#39;t know what was said or done or what
was done by these craft but he said to
me it was made it very clear that they
weren&#39;t real happy that we were going
there in this way and that in my opinion
why we round down the space program to
the moon you know my uncle was involved
with this and there was all kinds of
plans to put colonies there in buildings
and have you know people living in sort
of like domes like they have out at the
biosphere in Arizona and what-have-you
and all that was shut down now the
excuse they gave was budgetary cuts but
I don&#39;t think it was budgetary cuts I
think it was because you know it was
quite clear that we were going out there
in maturely as a warring civilization
and not as
peaceful world civilization which is the
requirement yes ma&#39;am
was that a peaceful thing together or
what
yo Kennedy did want to do a
International from the beginning space
program and you know when he was
assassinated GRU Khrushchev wept and
stated now we will not have World Peace
because Kennedy and actually Bobby
Kennedy said this Bobby Kennedy jr. who
I&#39;ve met said this recently on a CNN
interview is that his his intent was in
a second term to get completely out of
Vietnam to do a cooperative and to make
total peace with the Soviet Union now of
course there goes a trillion dollars in
military-industrial intelligence
spending and they were not happy about
that he was also going to disclose this
UFO issue and I think there were a
number of reasons why you know he was
just not willing to succumb to their
view of how the world needed to progress
with endless conflict and that&#39;s why
there was no second term of Jack Kennedy
in my opinion now from what I know and
this is also somewhat corroborated
although in a bit of a titillating way
with the document I got from the
National Security Agency contact I have
that&#39;s the Marilyn Monroe document and
in the Marilyn Monroe document it&#39;s a
top-secret document that was handed off
to me never declassified authenticated
by a man who used to be general Odom oh
do m&#39;s right-hand guy who is National
Security Agency had for years and in
this document
there was a wiretap summary that the CIA
wiretapping a bunch of people but mainly
Marilyn Monroe who as you know it had an
affair with Jack Kennedy and also with
Bobby Kennedy and they knew coming to
public and so in 1962 or whenever it was
they cut that off and she was furious so
she was calling up Bobby Kennedy
Attorney General and an art dealer named
Roth
in New York and other people saying that
she was gonna hold a news conference to
tell Jack Kennedy to tell the world what
Jack Kennedy had told her about quote
objects from outer space that were
recovered in New Mexico in the 40s clear
reference to Roswell as well as some
other matters that wiretap summary is
dated the day before they found her dead
now when I brought this up too there was
a famous actor in singer named Brewer
lives he used to be on our Executive
Committee and he was friends with
marilyn monroe and elizabeth taylor and
Berle eyes when I showed this document
to him he says he just held his head he
says we all know Marilyn was killed and
that it wasn&#39;t an overdose we didn&#39;t
know why and he was a 33rd degree Mason
burr lives was his his he has a room in
this building next door the big 33rd
degree Masonic Temple next door and I
said yeah well Marilyn didn&#39;t know what
kind of big toes and big gorillas he was
stepping on but of course the whole
world would have covered that press
conference it would have been
sensational and so Marilyn Monroe almost
certainly was assassinated because she
was going way too far off the
reservation and this document has the
proper project code names and code
numbers for that era project moondust
project 46 some of these key project
code names and code numbers for the
early 60s I have that document it&#39;s in
my first book it&#39;s there for anyone to
read it&#39;s it&#39;s explosive and it&#39;s it&#39;s
dispositive actually but unfortunately
for Marilyn Monroe you know she didn&#39;t
realize that this was non-trivial this
is not a trivial thing to hold a press
conference a person of her stardom in
that era I mean she was huge talking
about these specific issues because he
had learned that apparently in pillow
talk with with Jack Kennedy and so it
was very cost of her life in order to
keep that quiet
