okay I would like to welcome all of you
to this special presentation on the deep
national security state and UFOs and
this is going to be a presentation four
hours in length we will take a break at
about half way point maybe about hour
and forty-five minutes in two hours
and I&#39;d like to just thank all of you
for coming I know you&#39;ve been from all
over the country here people here from
Chicago New York all over and I want to
appreciate express my appreciation for
your support and effort in coming all
that way to be here I&#39;d also like to
welcome all the folks online there are
several thousand people online who will
be seeing this by webinar and I&#39;d like
to extend a welcome to them and a big
shout out to them for coming thank you
you&#39;re here in virtual reality huh yeah
why not
so I&#39;m dr. Steven Greer and a founder of
the disclosure project and the Center
for the Study of extraterrestrial
intelligence and the Orion project those
are all now sort of amalgamated under
serious disclosure calm if you want to
go and see what all the projects are
doing at any time and we&#39;re going to be
doing this presentation which is going
to be part of a series and I really want
to thank the people who supported me all
these years and getting this far there&#39;s
some folks who are volunteers out front
who&#39;ve been on many expeditions with me
out under the stars and people all over
the world my mentors in the national
security state who without them I would
have never had a Sherpa to figure out
how this whole system works you&#39;re gonna
learn things tonight today that the
President of the United States doesn&#39;t
know I will assure you that I&#39;ll give
you my assurance that is true it is also
true that without some very special
person and her name is Emily
my wife of 36 years we wouldn&#39;t be here
so a big thank you to Emily she set this
up and really and truly if emily had not
but supported me all these years it
aren&#39;t many jewish doctors daughters
wives who will be happy with their
husband leaving a career in emergency
medicine to be doing this for virtually
nothing for 25 years and that&#39;s when we
started this project 25 years ago so
she&#39;s amazing person and without her we
would have never ever gotten this far
she&#39;s really been the indispensable
person that nobody knows about my when I
acknowledge her so thank you Emily love
you so the other thing I&#39;d like to do as
we just some housekeeping things again
no cell phones please and if there are
any children who are on the webinar I
know this sounds strange we&#39;re gonna go
through some things that are disturbing
and I would say parental discretion is
advised
for that reason I&#39;ve used
would not say that but we are today and
I need to say it
and the first thing I want to go through
is sort of a an architecture of what the
deep national security state is because
this is something that when I started
out in 1990 I didn&#39;t think could
possibly be true and in fact when I was
meeting with the French government
officials a few years ago here in
Washington and then out at her farm in
Virginia I got a phone call from a Air
Force intelligence guy and a liaison to
the French president at that time
Nicolas Sarkozy who said this is
fantastic and terrible and he didn&#39;t
know if he quite believed it and I said
well come to Washington and I&#39;ll let you
meet with some folks who were in the
deep national security state who will
confirm everything I&#39;m about to tell you
so they came to Washington and we had a
meeting and I began to explain to them
that there are two governments there&#39;s
the government of We the People at
Thomas Jefferson spoke of that we have
elected those who have been appointed
and since World War two there has
evolved a monster which you&#39;re gonna
hear about which desperately needs to be
put on a leash and eventually phased out
and that is the deep national security
state of unacknowledged special access
projects now this is a term most people
are not familiar with and with most of
you if your government anyone for here
from DC raise your hand if you&#39;re a DC
person you probably have heard of TSS CI
top-secret special compartment at
intelligence a top secret clearance or
unlike nine hundred and eighty five
thousand people who have them it&#39;s you
know a dollar fifty you&#39;ll get you on
the Metro so those are not unusual
what&#39;s unusual or the projects I&#39;m about
to talk to you about
and these unacknowledged special access
projects are projects that have not been
supervised value the President or the
Congress in an appropriate way
since 1956 at least 1956 this is a key
date for you to keep in mind I was one
year old so I couldn&#39;t do anything about
that most of us here weren&#39;t of an age
we could have done anything about that
disaster but we&#39;re going to talk about
how that evolved and and how an
unacknowledged special access project
really operates the very first thing you
need to understand is that it developed
as a consequence of the extraordinary
secrecy around the UFO issue and if you
doubt it it goes all the way back to
1945 and I&#39;m gonna go through some
documents the one that&#39;s up here is one
that we acquired and released it&#39;s now
the number one viewed document on the
FBI site this one but before I get to
that I want to talk about what happened
in the 1940s in world war ii so most of
you know we had President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt and there were events
going on in Europe and also in the
Pacific but mainly in Europe where there
were these things called Foo Fighters
yes it&#39;s a rock group and Dave Grohl
it&#39;s great guy he named his band after
what I&#39;m about to tell you but a Foo
Fighter aside from being a really fun
rock band were objects that were flying
around our aircraft in world war ii
sometimes they were fully materialized
hard most of the time they were an
energy field that looks spherical and
they could come through an aircraft even
coming down the center of an aircraft
and out the other end this is a
transdimensional nature of
extraterrestrial technologies that I
covered in a previous workshop this
became a huge concern for the Allies and
the Allies dispatched or
the president I should say on behalf of
the allies dispatched a man named
general Jimmy Doolittle how do I knew
this because his nephew is a dear friend
of mine dr. John Altschuler dr.
Altschuler is a hematologist oncologist
in Denver a borough renowned and he was
asked general Doolittle was asked to go
over to the theatres of operations in
Europe to find out what the hell these
things were now the word Foo Fighters
come from sort of French and German foe
for fire because they were these fiery
had a luminous corona around them and
but they were they were disrupt
electromagnetic signals they would have
effects on the gravity around an
aircraft and other things such as a
guidance systems compasses and
what-have-you
and so we thought the Americans and
British thought it was a secret Nazi
weapon and we found out through our
spies that the Germans thought it was a
secret
allied weapon and of course it was
neither so general Doolittle went over
and investigated this and came back to
the White House and reported back to
President Roosevelt and said sir these
are interplanetary vehicles I&#39;m quoting
and so began the modern era of a serious
concern from the national security level
about UFOs you can argue it went back to
the airship scare of 1890s late 1890s
where there were massive craft seeing
off the coast of California but there
wasn&#39;t that much official concern at
that point it was sort of an enigma but
in World War two because of the type of
weapons being developed both by Hitler
and by America the interstellar as I
call them became very concerned about
what humans were doing on earth and the
risk of us destroying this planet which
I believe men carefully and analyzing
the history of this that they have a
interest in its survival
and humanity&#39;s survival and so the
president at that point did assemble a
group of folks that included Oppenheim
er people who work on the Manhattan
Project
dr. Vannevar Bush no relationship to
President Bush and others to look into
the issue by the time we detonated the
first atomic bomb the facilities at
White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico
and Alamogordo that area were being
overflowing regularly by UFOs and they
were very concerned obviously that we
were developing weapons that could
terminate life on the planet and they
could see where this was headed so this
was not something that just happened
out of the blue there&#39;s a history here
you must understand in the early days
and I&#39;m talking now from the early mid
1940s until 1956 there was a reasonable
level of constitutional oversight by key
members of Congress senior people in the
administration&#39;s and the President of
the United States everything changed in
1956 now when we had the only nuclear
and it would actually technically it&#39;s
an atomic bomb squadron and not a
thermonuclear one that was developed
later everybody know the difference
between atomic and thermonuclear atomic
bomb is fission nuclear is fusion
hydrogen anyway the atomic bomb that we
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was
developed as you all know in New Mexico
and it was tested at White Sands and
eventually in Roswell New Mexico that
was the only bomber squadron that had
atomic bombs in the world for a number
of years before the Soviet Union
developed them
and in at in 1947 there were two or
three I have intelligence recently that
indicates there were three so-called
flying saucers disks flying by and doing
a surveillance of the 509th bomber
squadron which was the only atomic bomb
squadron in the world and they switched
on suddenly a an alleged radar system
read this document carefully now this I
know it&#39;s hard for you to see the
original it&#39;s dated 1950 it was - J
Edgar Hoover Yeager Hoover buildings
right near here and an Air Force a
source stated that there were three
flying saucers recovered in New Mexico
they&#39;re described as circular in shape
with raised centers fifty feet in
diameter each one was occupied by three
bodies of human shape but only three
feet tall they&#39;re actually about 39
inches tall in metallic cloth very fine
texture etc and it says that these
saucers were found in New Mexico due to
the fact that the government has a very
high-powered radar set up in that area
and is believed the radar interferes
with the controlling mechanism of the
saucers this is a little bit
anthropocentric and childish because if
you can go interstellar you can handle a
radar system what actually happened is
that those radar domes had a scalar
longitudinal electromagnetic weapon
which is another whole classification of
electromagnetic warfare systems that
we&#39;ll get into later but suffice it to
say it was an early scalar Star Wars hit
and when they switched that on at least
two of these disks collided one went
down
northwest of Roswell the other one
continued and was more intact and was
impacted near Socorro New Mexico
that&#39;s where they actually retrieved the
bodies the ones that was just north of
Roswell was obliterated into the little
teeny pieces tiny little pieces where
they did retrieve and we have disclosure
project witnesses who have testified to
this where they who have personally seen
what looks like almost hieroglyphic
writing on some of the little parts that
were retrieved and I know I&#39;ve seen
these and it&#39;s it&#39;s very interesting
because it&#39;s reminiscent of the ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphics but not quite the
same fiction wonder where the pyramids
came from so that event was an early hit
now there are some reports of others but
that&#39;s the most documented one this
document from the FBI is significant
because obviously three years later you
had one branch of the government trying
to find out what the other top-secret
branch of the government was doing you
can tell by the tone of it I made
inquiries through here and there so it&#39;s
a bunch of skullduggery that happens
between agencies and competition and
there&#39;s always been competition between
FBI CIA Air Force intelligence etc and
so on and this happens not just with
United States it also happens with in
between allies and and alliances for
example the next document if you can
pull this up this is one of the most
important documents now by the way after
I brief the CIA director about all this
stuff the sitting CIA director for
President Clinton which we&#39;ll get into
in a moment
I got a cache of several thousand of
these documents about five thousand of
them and they&#39;re in my vault I don&#39;t
know what to do with them if we
presented what was in them it would take
us from now until 2017 but let me just
say that this document was accidentally
released by the Canadian government and
if you look at the date on it 1950
November 21st how ironic this is the
65th anniversary of the writing of this
document by Wilbur Smith who had a top
secret clearance and he
was tasked by the Canadian government to
find out what the Americans were doing
and if you look at page two if you go
down to page two of this you&#39;re gonna
see just a brief summary which I think
is there&#39;s a whole lot of detail in the
document this is on our website now you
can look it up many of you may have seen
this when already but I wanted the
reason I want to present it is the
importance of the document and he&#39;s and
it says the matter is the most highly
classified subject in the United States
government rating higher than the h-bomb
think about that the h-bomb wasn&#39;t
detonated until 1952 it was the ultimate
doomsday weapon this project dealing
with UFOs and interstellar technologies
was more highly classified than the
h-bomb period the flying saucers exist
period their modus operandi is unknown
but a concentrated effort is being made
by a small group of headed by dr.
Vannevar Bush who also worked with
Edward Teller Oppenheim ER and others
and for the entire matter is considered
by the United States authorities to be
of tremendous significance I have a
whole dossier that a Canadian put
together of the well versed Smith
investigations on behalf of the Canadian
government to find out what in the hell
the Americans were doing with these
extraterrestrial vehicles it&#39;s a
fascinating case now the reason this is
so important is that it acknowledges to
several things that they exist that is
the most secret issue and the US
government exceeding the secrecy of the
h-bomb and that a group had been put
together to study how they operate well
they were studying material recovered
from one or more interstellar crashes
that were the result of using the scale
our longitudinal electromagnetic systems
which Tesla had worked on and others had
worked on in the early part of the 20th
century keep in mind that
by the early 1900&#39;s there had been
experiments done on not only scalar and
electro magnetics that longitudinal
systems which are just to put it in a
simple layman&#39;s term the light in this
room that we&#39;re looking at it has a wave
function and a particle function goes
186,000 miles a second a scalar
longitudinal the system is there&#39;s no
wave it&#39;s boom and it&#39;s a point and it&#39;s
multiples of the speed of light and so
once you understand how these operate
and I have folks at the naval research
labs here in Washington who have done
communication systems developed based on
pulsed scalar systems that are multiple
of the speed of light so if you think
that you cannot communicate faster than
the speed of light you&#39;re wrong and the
physicists are wrong it&#39;s because they
don&#39;t know about the scalar end of this
but that&#39;s enough cuz that&#39;s all
classified we&#39;re going to teach you that
at MIT or Caltech so these systems have
been developed and have been deployed
since at least the mid 1940s which is a
frightening thought because it&#39;s an area
of technology that is potentially
devastating if it&#39;s in the wrong hands
and unfortunately it fell into the wrong
hands and there remains so one of the
things that happened along the lines
around this time the next document a
very important one look at the release
date there&#39;s a few it was a little bit a
little while after a few months after i
briefed the CIA director so after i met
with him i said look i&#39;m gonna give you
a list of stuff I want to see if I can
get I got this massive box came out to
my farm in Virginia and this is one of
them and there are others and it&#39;s from
1953 although you can&#39;t see the date on
it very well here
and it&#39;s about the the it&#39;s written by
the director of the CIA to the director
of psychological strategy board
psychological strategy board what
psychological warfare and it says you
can read it I&#39;m transmitting to the
National Security Council a proposal tab
be a which we don&#39;t have which is
concluded that the problems connected to
UFOs appear to have implications for
psychological warfare as well as for
intelligence and operations and then
there&#39;s another tab B which has the
background I&#39;d love to see that one I
suggest that we discussed in an early
board meeting the possible offensive or
defensive utilization of these phenomena
for psychological warfare purposes
remember this document four hours from
now because basically what they
concluded was they needed to do a few
things they wanted to be able to set up
a deception around the subject and put
out false information use it as a cover
story for classified aerospace research
so oftentimes there will be something
that happens and it will look like a UFO
and it&#39;s actually a Northrop Grumman my
uncle&#39;s company was Northrop Grumman he
worked on the thing that landed on the
moon the lunar module or Lockheed Martin
skunk works or some other aerospace
entity and it will be a hundred percent
man-made and the public will say oh my
god is a UFO and they&#39;ll not correct
them there&#39;s no correction forthcoming
they want you to believe it&#39;s a UFO why
because it provides a cover for
classified research with technologies
that if they were allowed to come out
would terminate the oil and gas and coal
industry they&#39;re using zero-point energy
and gravity control which then brings me
to the next issue
and and that is by 1954 October so now
we&#39;re 61 years plus one month into an
era and this was confirmed to me by the
third highest ranking official at the
naval research labs and the highest
ranking scientist in other words someone
who not was on a bureaucrat at the naval
research labs which Thomas Edison
founded and the naval research labs is
the largest defense lab in the United
States and Richard foix and I knew him
for many years before he passed away of
prostate cancer not too long ago was
this gentleman I&#39;ve never wanted to
discuss who he was until he passed away
and he was a very senior guy in this
system and one of the things that he
shared is that he was in the vault the
same vault that the next document came
out of which has a great story behind it
and he was going through some
documentation and found that it wasn&#39;t
in the 50s that we really started I mean
the the the the 60s or 70s but it was in
the 50s that we actually mastered
gravity control now what does that mean
gravity control is the ability to put in
an electromagnetic field at certain
voltages and with certain angular
momentum I want to get into a lot of put
you to sleep we get into the physics of
it too far so that this object becomes
massless weightless no mass ma SS so the
mass component and this has to do with
angular momentum and things of this sort
of the subatomic particles can make this
object so light that it has no mass
which means if you look at your physics
equations mass velocity is inversely
proportional to mass go look it up so if
mass becomes zero velocity can go to
infinity and in a given amount of energy
which means you can move into an
other dimension it doesn&#39;t go to
infinity you go in you troop
transdimensional we&#39;ll talk about this
some more later and this began to be
experimented with in the 1920s a guy
named T Townsend Brown developed a
system using crystalline structures and
very high voltages going into an object
so that in an object we begin to
levitate Marcel Vogel the chief one the
chief engineer scientist for IBM in
North Carolina on the Reynolds estate
did the same thing in the 60s and 70s
one of the members of my team and one of
our disclosure project witnesses work
with Marcel Vogel doing this with
crystalline structures and it can be
crystals but it can also be from nano
crystalline materials such as metallic
so as you know all most metals and rocks
are crystal actually water is
crystalline or crystalline
so you can put this system around almost
anything and it will begin to become
increasingly massless now it doesn&#39;t
have to be zero mass maybe it&#39;s 0.1 mass
so it&#39;s still materialize you see it but
it means man can you accelerate this
thing so it means you can instead of
going like the Space Shuttle at 25,000
miles an hour you can go at several
million miles per hour and take a right
turn and there&#39;s no deceleration effect
because everyone on board is corrected
for 1g so this is what they began 1g
gravitational force so this is what
began to develop in the twenties got
taken into some air army air force
projects in the 30s and 40s and was
Adolf Hitler&#39;s secret weapon Adolf
Hitler they weren&#39;t making the progress
on the atomic bomb that we were but they
had almost perfected gravity control by
the time World War two ended now one of
the things that the OSS did in the
office of the special services which
became the CIA after World War two
they had at something you can look this
up called Operation Paperclip an
Operation Paperclip the whole book was
written on it not too long ago about how
they would put a paper clip on the file
of the Nazis that we didn&#39;t want to go
to Nuremberg and execute but that whose
knowledge was so great that we wanted
them as part of our program we wanted
what they knew so one of these guys is a
guy named Wernher von Braun who and of
course invented the rocket the v2 rocket
/ Adolf Hitler Hermann Oberth these were
all the giants of rocketry and aerospace
for Adolf Hitler they became the
foundation of brought in by the CIA what
came to CIA of our space program in the
1940s and 50s which is how we left ahead
of the Soviet Union because we took all
those people burst ahead of the Soviet
Union interesting bit of history you
don&#39;t read this many places but most a
lot of what I&#39;m telling you is in
conventional history books not the UFO
part that&#39;s been sanitized out that&#39;s
forbidden knowledge so as a result by
the time we had those guys and the
experimentation that had been done with
by T Townsend Brown whose work became a
part of a corporation called the RAND
Corporation which still exists a huge
think-tank
we really had something going you add to
this the study of material and
electronics retrieved from interstellar
vehicles that were shot down so a lot of
people say oh well the things we have
are they all just reverse engineered
from interstellar
ETI said no the laws of the universe are
universal and the mind of man just like
the man of the neeti can unravel the
mysteries of the universe and so it has
come to pass
but if you take we&#39;re not starting at
zero when we retrieve the objects that
rain or stellar we were starting with
decades of research and classified
electronics
electromagnetic fields anti-gravity
scalar systems etc and so on that had
been going on since the time of Nikola
Tesla the true genius of the 20th
century not Albert Einstein by the way
so who is a minor luminary compared to
Tesla and I&#39;m sorry
Einstein fans it&#39;s true by the way
that&#39;s why when nikola tesla died the
FBI swooped into his apartment
and confiscated all of his secret papers
and how do I know this I have a document
from the Department of Defense demanding
that the FBI turned them over and names
them for what they are
the secret papers of Nikola Tesla this
is not an urban myth I have that
document it came in this cache of
documents I&#39;m talking about so when you
have all of that knowledge is then
augmented increased potentiated by the
study of as the world war smith document
says the material that was interstellar
because you need specialized materials
you need control systems you need
integrated circuits which we did not
have in the 40s which came from this you
need fiber optics you need all kinds of
stuff so some of the technologies and
this is where Colonel Corso who worked
on these projects tangentially is
correct if you read the day after
Roswell and he says fiber optics
integrated circuits and a whole slew of
things came from studying the material
from these crashed et interstellar
objects so you had the biggest and most
top-secret most well-funded project in
the history of the United States going
on nobody knew about it&#39;s completely
Subrosa
it was more secret than the hydrogen
bomb and so between 1945 and 1954
the brainpower of the Nazi aerospace
folks like Bernhard von Braun and
Hermann Oberth
the work of Pete Townsend Brown and
others Edward Teller some of the
brightest and most ingenious people in
the world put bent their attention
primarily not to the hydrogen bomb
but to gravity control and what how are
these interstellar visitors getting here
because that would then be the ultimate
edge wouldn&#39;t it in the technological
arms race you talk about a delivery
system
you don&#39;t need an intercontinental
ballistic missile that goes a few
thousand miles an hour if you can
deliver something instantly from one
continent to another or worse from one
planet to another you begin to see the
implications of this for national
security
therefore it was managed in an
extraordinary fashion and the secrecy
around it was increasingly ruthless so
much so that by 1956 the president of
the United States a man named Dwight
Eisenhower most of us drive on
Eisenhower era highways using 1880s
Mercedes type internal combustion engine
cars that are run by fossil fuels all of
which have been obsolete since the 1940s
or sooner but Eisenhower was a five-star
general became president two-term
president and was a Republican very
patriotic but also very naively trusting
Jackie Gleason the very famous comedian
his wife were friends with some folks
that have been on my team before they
passed away and said that Eisenhower on
his deathbed was a very bitter man over
what happened to him between 1954 and
when he left office in early 1961 when
Jack Kennedy became the president
of the united states and in 1956 a man
named nelson rockefeller who later of
course became vice president and prior
to that was an operative in the
military-industrial complex and the
emerging deep national security state
nelson headed up what&#39;s called the
Rockefeller Commission and the
Rockefeller Commission in 1956
reorganized the Pentagon Department of
Defense CIA the whole alphabet soup of
secret entities and they did so in such
a way that it became labyrinthine
Byzantine almost impossible to penetrate
by anyone who wanted to navigate through
it in the early days there was still
some presidential knowledge we have one
of our witnesses mr. Lufkin who is an
attorney who was a young man white house
Signal Corps here at the white house
down the street from where we&#39;re
speaking today you can look at his
testimony on our website serious
disclosure calm and he said yes he would
be at meetings and the the Eisenhower
would be making doodles pictures of UFOs
and et cap in fact I have one sitting in
my condo here in DC that someone lifted
from the archives say where and how and
he said basically Eisenhower was voiced
to him a great frustration over the fact
that there were all these projects going
on and he had lost control of the
oversight of them so what happened with
the Rockefeller Commission in 1956 is
that they made it virtually impossible
for any ordinary congressman or
president because you know they come
every four to eight years don&#39;t they so
by time they leave even if they&#39;re there
eight years maybe they&#39;re a little less
wet-behind-the-ears but it&#39;s a system
that guarantees their ignorance except
to the extent that they want to give you
just enough information to control
what&#39;s going on we&#39;ll get into this in a
moment
so by the time Eisenhower left office he
made the very famous speech about beware
of the military-industrial complex as
you&#39;ve seen in the film serious by the
way serious became number one on Netflix
a few months ago cool thank you guys for
supporting that and the president said
it will become a threat to our national
security and our way of life not the
UFOs the secrecy no less a figure the
same year Admiral Roscoe helling heater
who was the first director of the CIA
he&#39;ll look this document up I may have
more documents we have time for me to go
through and it&#39;s a letter where he&#39;s
right in and saying that the secrecy
around the UFO subject is a threat to
our national security
and to the United States this is the
first CIA director because he also later
found out he was me and Schmidt can&#39;t
pushed aside by these neo-fascists who
had taken over the intelligence
community the aerospace community and
the large corporations what happened
over those years from 1947 until 1956
was that there was a deliberate albeit
imperceptible initially takeover by the
corporate state corporations working
with unacknowledged special access
projects which are completely off the
radar not funded officially took over
operations and as a result of that those
national security programs increasingly
became out of reach for the president
out of reach for members of Congress or
even cabinet level people like CIA
directors and secretaries of state and
secretaries of state and people of this
sort so this was a gradual thing that
happened but there was abrupt change by
56 by 1961 when Eisenhower left office
frankly we were done
it was done now you know I couldn&#39;t do
anything about that at that point it
didn&#39;t run the disclosure project cuz I
was only five years old or six and so it
just suffered and went along and the and
the national security apparatus got
bigger and bigger and bigger when Jack
Kennedy took over in January of 1961 he
had a great interest in this and he was
in fact briefed on the subject but as we
know from the lieutenant halt who was on
the early meetings I had that ironically
Nelson&#39;s brother Lawrence Rockefeller
who is the white hat in the Rockefeller
clan who actually wanted to end secrecy
on the subject
Laurance Rockefeller was a very early
supporter of cset II and the disclosure
project and he funded and I organized
the Asilomar Monterey gathering of KGB
CIA astronauts cosmonauts in 1995 and
what I found is that some of the people
who came had been involved with the
Kennedy administration and one of these
gentlemen this lieutenant colonel was on
Air Force one flying to Berlin
when Kennedy made a very famous speech I
am A Berliner
I think he misspoke it a little but from
what I hear from the Germans but on that
flight this airforce officer who was
sort of like the chief steward who sort
of ran Air Force One for the president
had a chat and this issue came up
because he had had been a pilot who had
seen one of these UFOs when as an Air
Force pilot and there are thousands of
sightings like this that we have in our
archive and he brought this up to the
prezi says oh yes I know about this he
says I&#39;ve been briefed on it a little
bit but and now I&#39;m quoting I have this
audio tape it is chilling audio tape but
he says unfortunately the whole matter
this is the president speaking the whole
matter is out of my hands and I don&#39;t
know why and began to cry so we know and
that was 1963 the June of 63 and of
course he was killed in November but
before that some other tragic things
happened there are a lot of tragedies
here the main thing being the loss of
almost a century of evolution by the
human race which is why I left medicine
I always tell people I used to say try
to save a life one at a time now we&#39;ve
have to do something to save the entire
human race and planet from what is a
disastrous situation that&#39;s developed so
I just say that now all of us have to
work together because our patient is
Gaia the earth and her 7 billion
children but if you look at this
document the next one this is very
dangerous document to have we have to
give you the proven alts of this this is
the Marilyn Monroe document it&#39;s
basically a death warrant for poor
Marilyn Monroe and you look at the date
on it three August 1962 they found her
dead the 5th of August it&#39;s signed by
James Jesus angleton the third at the
bottom project moon dust up at the top
and project 46 these are correct code
names and code numbers for UFO et
related projects by the agency as of
that date and as you read through it and
it gives some background it&#39;s a wiretap
summary if you look at the top of it
it&#39;s a no it&#39;s a very degraded document
but it&#39;s a wiretap summary of telephone
conversations between Marilyn Monroe and
Robert Kennedy the Attorney General and
a guy named Rothberg who was a art
dealer in New York and they were tapping
Marilyn&#39;s phone because she had had
tryst as it says here with the President
and
everyone knows now she had an affair
with both Jack Kennedy and Robert
Kennedy and in hello talk the president
had told her some things and it says one
such secret that she was going to
divulge in a news conference mentions
the visit by the president at a secret
airbase for the purpose of inspecting
things from outer space I don&#39;t think
they&#39;re talking about meteorites
Kilgallon who had been a reporter who
dug into this reply that she knew what
might be the source of the visit in the
mid-50s Kilgallen learned of a secret
effort by US and UK governments to
identify the origins of crashed
spacecraft and dead bodies from a
British government official that was
Lord Mountbatten Kilgallen believed the
story who was later blown up by an IRA
bomb or so it was made to appear
Kilgallen believed the story may have
come from the New Mexico crash in the
late 40s
clear reference to the Roswell event and
she said that if the story is true it
would cause terrible embarrassment to
Jack and his plans to have NASA put men
on the moon because we were using old
rockets from the 40s when the secret
organization already had anti-gravity
under control in this subject repeatedly
called the Attorney General and
complained about the way she was being
ignored by the president the subject
threatened to hold a press conference
and would tell all underlying in the
original document that&#39;s not my
underlining the subject made references
to bases in Cuba Cuba and knew of the
president&#39;s plan to kill Castro and
number five the subject made references
to her diary of Secrets and what the
newspapers would do with such
disclosures two days later she&#39;s found
dead now this document how did I get it
it&#39;s top secret and it has not been
Declassified and it is authentic a man
whose family helped found the National
Security Agency NSA it was so supportive
of what the work I was doing that he
appeared one day with this
document and it was a huge one of those
old Xerox from a big you know government
Xerox machine might the original I have
in my vault is quite impressive and he
says you need to know the kinds of
things I think he was not trying to
scare me off but he was wanting me to
know the kinds of things that have been
done the people who tell these kind of
Secrets and so he gave me this document
and as soon as I saw it I suspected it
was legitimate later I had it inspected
by a man who I don&#39;t wish to name but he
was the officer who was a general Odom
OD om who was head of the NSA for years
he was general Odom&#39;s right-hand guy
literally carried his briefcase and he
became a document Authenticator and a
lecturer at University of Maryland who
frankly when he looked at he says
without me taking it from the vault
myself I can tell you 95% certainty it&#39;s
authentic because everything in it so
basically what happened is that Marilyn
Monroe was being jilted by the Kennedys
because it was put him into well known
they were having an affair
the Kennedys did not order her
assassination Angleton did now who is
Angleton Angleton was the big hole books
have been written about this guy James
Jesus Angleton the third was the guy who
at the CIA was the big mole hunter he
was the guy who would chase down
anywhere a leak was coming from and had
everyone tapped and he realized that she
was about to light this up and hold a
press conference to talk about the et
bodies from outer space and all these
secrets that Jack Kennedy had told her
just out of spite
she was just furious that they had sort
of pushed her out of the inner circle
and you know the whole thing about a
woman scorned but unfortunately for
Marilyn it cost her her life I later
after I got this document met with a man
hood who at that time had worked in the
Intelligence Unit of the Los Angeles
Police Department who separately had a
wiretap on her in her home who confirmed
to me this was a hundred percent
true now I don&#39;t know how many of you
know a guy named burl ives who&#39;s a actor
and singer and everyone thinks he was
like Frosty the Snowman but he was
actually a very accomplished actor and
folk singer and very good friends with
Marilyn Monroe Elizabeth Taylor people
like that he was on my executive
committee for a number of years and by
the time he was involved I had that
document and I went to visit him they
had moved from Montecito and Santa
Barbara up to Anacortes Washington and I
was in his room I was actually sitting
on the edge of his bed he was up there
in years big jolly guy great bear of a
guy and I shared this document with him
he says oh my god he&#39;s a 33rd degree
Mason by the way he says we all know
every one of us knew Maryland had been
killed but we never knew why we had no
idea why and this is why this is the
thing and so that was also a shot across
the bow to the Kennedys now Jack Kennedy
had great affection for Maryland even
though it was indiscreet for her him to
continue seeing her and he was furious
that someone in the intelligence
community I don&#39;t even think he he
certainly didn&#39;t know about this
document he was very upset is what I
understand that Marilyn was killed by
these operatives and he vowed to try to
bring out this information himself and I
think that&#39;s why he began to speak a
little more openly to this airforce
officer whose audio recording I have and
that was of course a year later this
happened in August of 62 the recording
with the airforce officer that&#39;s
conversation with Jack Kennedy happened
in 1963 June in November he was
assassinated as the Kennedy was planning
if he had become the president he was
going to dissolve the CIA get us out of
Vietnam disclosed this information and
make peace with the Soviet Union that&#39;s
what he was going to do
and those folks in the intelligence
community and the warmongers and the
profit ears and the military-industrial
complex said like bloody hell you will
and that was the end of him so that&#39;s
why I mean although I thought they were
joking initially when I first is this
getting this is a good information for
you folks I hope hope is not too much
but I&#39;m gonna cover Norma&#39;s amount today
you&#39;ve got to know the background so
over this time period from 1945 40s to
nineteen early 60s there developed a
decision was made I know this sounds
like a joke because everyone says it if
I tell you I have to kill you that&#39;s
some there&#39;s some truth to that so they
the secrecy that got developed around
this issue became more and more and more
restricted even from people who were
presidents or Senate Intelligence
Committee members or members of the
cabinet because another man who was
killed John Foster Dulles shoved out of
a window Dulles was killed he has been
CIA director he was starting to make
noises about change in the direction of
things and he was also killed Dulles
Airport named after him so the decision
was made how do we do this without
risking having to continue to engage in
the wet works and there&#39;s a guy I know
at the CIA who kind of has my back who
has been there for years PhD guy who has
a team of wet works guys wet works or
assassinations so wet work sorbate wet
comes from blood so you know you don&#39;t
want to pull the trigger on wet works if
you don&#39;t have to so they decided here
in the 50s and 60s to create so much
secrecy and have it so compartmentalized
and tightly held that they didn&#39;t want
to risk doing that anymore because it
was really disruptive to the nation and
that is really the genesis of
unacknowledged special access projects
now a special access project just means
you have to have you know the clearance
to get to it and be read into it as they
say in military speak but an
unacknowledged project I just want to go
through a minute how that works
let&#39;s say that this gentleman is a
four-star general and I&#39;m a colonel I
made a joke four-star general but I&#39;m an
unacknowledged special access project
dealing with this or some other subject
it can be other things as well if I am
in an unacknowledged project I am told
and I have one of my most senior
military advisors has been in multiple
of these he was in one project that was
two to three billion dollars he knew it
was more than two and almost three
billion in a project that was off the
books no accounting President didn&#39;t
know Congress didn&#39;t know tightly held
military guy working with some corporate
folks and he told me he says here&#39;s how
it works he says you take they take you
to ask if a secure communication
intelligence facility SCIF take all the
equipment off of you any guns off cell
phones watches nothing anything metallic
you go in to this underground facility
and there&#39;s a meeting and it&#39;s he said
hey you have a come in to Jesus talk and
what happens is that you are told that
only the people in that room are read
into and cleared to this unacknowledged
special access project and if you speak
of it outside of that circle of people
there&#39;s one person there with a gun and
a bullet he takes the bullet out he says
it has your name on it if you speak to
anyone and I mean anyone your wife the
president your
commander about what we&#39;re doing and
that is how it works this is not a
conspiracy theory I&#39;ve been in these
gifts I&#39;ve been in a couple places and I
can tell you that is exactly how it
operates so one of the things I wanted
to make really clear about what I&#39;m
presenting today I&#39;m not talking about
anything that I don&#39;t have first-hand
direct knowledge of everything I&#39;m
telling you every bit of it but I don&#39;t
care about conspiracy theories they&#39;re
mostly 99% wrong and I really don&#39;t care
about the internet chatter you know this
is 25 years of the most incredible
investigative research and you know I
put over 10 million dollars of my
earnings and life into doing to get this
far I can tell you if you if you&#39;re in a
stunning knowledge project and I was
offered this position back in 92 and
that&#39;s my wife about it and I rejected
it I was actually offered two billion
dollars personally it&#39;s a fund with two
billion dollars in it if I would shut
the hell up
join one of these unacknowledged
projects and do what they wanted me to
do and I said screw you I&#39;m not doing it
but that&#39;s what was offered and that&#39;s
when a billion dollars was a lot of
money back then now you know there many
in a billionaire every week in Silicon
Valley but you know in 1992 2 billion
was a lot money so what ended up
happening in this scenario is if my
four-star commanding general calls me in
because he&#39;s heard rumblings about
something that people are working on
here and know about under threat of
death Tweep terminate with extreme
prejudice which is death t WEP I am to
turn to him even though he&#39;s my
four-star commander I&#39;m only a colonel
and I&#39;m to say sir no such project
exists that&#39;s how it works it&#39;s illegal
it&#39;s unconstitutional it&#39;s criminal it
is dangerous because once you have a
breakdown in the rule of law we&#39;re back
in the jungle we&#39;re back into our Qaeda
territory
we&#39;re back into the Wild West where
there&#39;s a Wallace nough stand that&#39;s
what happened and because of that no
president since Eisenhower has had
anything near the level of information
on this that would be required for the
chief executive most CIA directors
haven&#39;t there are a few who have and a
few who haven&#39;t and I&#39;ll tell you a
little bit about why that&#39;s the case in
a moment who who&#39;s been in and who&#39;s out
dick Helms was in Woolsey was out it&#39;s a
long story but I mean I&#39;ll try to cover
it I mean you guys are going to get more
information it&#39;s gonna be TMI too much
information by the end of this but this
this is why I&#39;m doing this today is that
I want to leave a record of everything
I&#39;ve learned that&#39;s critical for the
public in case you know I&#39;m 60 now who
knows what happened to me so it&#39;s
important to leave this but if you&#39;re
the president don&#39;t assume that you have
an all-access pass the presidential
daily briefing doesn&#39;t have anything
really that critical in it and almost
never of this subject by the time you
had Johnson come along and then you had
Nixon and Nixon by the way was vice
president for Eisenhower Nixon actually
was pulled in as head of space committee
the vice president sits this chair of
the Space Committee into majestic this
group magic maj i see is actually what
it&#39;s called it&#39;s a majority intelligence
committee in a jic it&#39;s the proper term
and magic tap Nixon and he thought his
president he would be the guy that would
disclose this because he thought it was
time and he was finally became president
after Jack Kennedy he felt swindled him
out of the presidency in 1960 and of
course Lyndon Johnson inherited the
presidency in a sense after the
assassination had one term part of
another rest of Jack Kennedy&#39;s term but
Nixon thought well okay I&#39;m going to do
this and so
a little thing called Watergate happened
everybody remember Watergate those of
you too young to remember it was the
break-in over here at this office and a
luxury apartment on the Potomac and it
was a bag job back men went in and broke
into the Democratic National Committee
offices to get lists and information and
Nixon ended up covering it up I mean
it&#39;s kind of standard operating
procedure you know it&#39;s like it wasn&#39;t
really that big of a deal in the sense
that it happens all the day you just
don&#39;t know it but there was a guy named
Woodard who it was
Oh an eye officer neighbor and you know
Bernstein Woodward and Bernstein look it
up and off the naval intelligence is
where he came from and suddenly this
young reporter has this deep throat well
he had a no ni guy give him the
information officer Naval Intelligence
because Nixon was planning to blow the
lid off the secrecy and the way they
took him down was by impeachment rather
than by a bullet that actually why Nixon
was impeached now he did do the
Watergate he was a crook but I mean I
would say most politicians have engaged
in such things I know I&#39;m a bit cynical
about it but you know it&#39;s it&#39;s not that
unusual for dirty tricks and off of
research to be done against someone else
and you have someone go and steal
something or rifle through trash to get
dirt on someone that&#39;s what they were
doing in this case it was a break-in so
technically it was illegal and then he
covered it up and he got impeached but
the real reason why that became such a
big scandal then hit the hit the
fan was that this o ni guy Woodard had a
source that he worked who had the
actionable intelligence on what really
happened and there goes the president
and of course you know we had Ford who
was a part term you know at the time a
guy and he had of CIA director bill
Colby who was a member of magic bill
Colby I&#39;m giving you like a 50 year
history real quick is this good you know
you need this huh
Kolbe and by the way Nixon had a guy
named dick Helms who did not want me to
talk about this at all and said as much
to someone who is part of a group and
that woman is in this room today but
what ended up happening with Colby is
that as he got older he was very very
upset and William Colby CIA director who
was involved to an extent in the magic
operations decided that it was really a
terrible what was happening to the
country and had very patriotic man he
was up there in years and he decided to
defect as a lone wolf but an
unacknowledged lone wolf and this is why
I will never allow this again so let me
tell you what really happened to Bill
Colby William Colby bill Colby reached
out to me through his best friend a
colonel who I will not name still living
and my old early man but a full-bird
colonel who had been in magic this
committee that the majority intelligence
committee it oversees the UFO issue and
he wanted bill Colby wanted to bring
forward the technologies not the things
that fly but in energy technology based
on these classified operations and some
seed money about fifty million dollars
and I guess kind of gray area seed money
to my group so we could bring these
technologies out and end the oil and
global warming and the poverty and all
of that now the person who approached me
remember my board and this Colonel
wouldn&#39;t say who the client was they
were gonna set up a secret meeting I
said I think it&#39;s safer if I know who he
is
they said why I said because I can put
him into a security system he says what
do you mean I said
not knowing is dangerous for him they
said no he won&#39;t do it that way so I
said okay
so I&#39;m working full-time as a trauma
doctor emergency doctor and we&#39;re
setting that up and the week before I&#39;m
gonna meet with this former CIA director
they find him floating down the Potomac
River made to look like an accident
and he was assassinated and it was
tragic and I said I will never do this
again
I felt terribly guilty and his best
friend came to my best friend&#39;s funeral
sherry adamak who had been helping me
for years and who was one of three of us
who mysteriously got metastatic cancer
the same month and Semyon I think you
knew sherry and this colonel came to her
wake and he just looked at me he says we
can&#39;t look back we have to keep putting
one foot in front the other even though
we both have had horrible losses yeah so
we did we kept going and you know when
when bill Colby was killed I thought at
that point well his game is over you
know I was from 94 and told now I was
about to give up on everything but
anyway very very difficult emotionally
and very difficult physically to carry
this for you know 25 years but you know
I figured this is the pearl of great
price you don&#39;t throw this one back in
to the water this is is huge so we
decided we would just continue
marshaling our energies and go forward
but we knew that we couldn&#39;t do anything
like that again it had to be open I mean
I had to know and to the extent things
could none of this skullduggery because
the secrecy is their domain if you go
that National Reconnaissance Office the
the super-secret spy agency that runs
all the satellites above their entrance
it says we own the night you can look
google it and I always say we need to
own the light we need to own the light
of disclosure and the truth and bring
this out so I try to do things to the
extent I can fully as fully as possible
out in the open
what while maintaining the
offenses of those who are still living
who asked me to do so but and that&#39;s why
I&#39;m giving you this much information
today the the other thing to remember
about how Colby demise evolved was that
he was going to make a run at one of the
big central reasons for the secrecy
which I&#39;ll get into in a moment and
that&#39;s the technology this is a big
Science and Technology story because
imagine bringing out a technology that
would sit on this podium that would run
your house pulling in energy from what&#39;s
been called the zero-point energy field
that never has to be rebooted for you
know fuel is pulling it out of the
fabric of space-time and it&#39;s estimated
every cubic centimeter of space in this
room has enough energy to run the United
States for a year if you can tap it and
it has been tapped so at the root of
interstellar transport aside from the
transdimensional and anti-gravity is the
energy source and the energy source is
this amazing electromagnetic flux field
in fact the early man-made UFOs were
called flux liners because it&#39;s pulling
energy out of this infinite ocean this
infinite sea as Tesla called it
professor direct called it the Dirac sea
but it was this infinite field of energy
that is at the root of space-time
embedded within space-time and so
bringing out something like that would
of course immediately make oil gas coal
Exxon Mobil cars internal combustion
engines jet engines rockets
diesel ocean liner and everything you
can think of that we use would be
obsolete and would be retired very
quickly now what I just named is several
hundred trillion dollars in mineral
assets and infrastructure because we
also would need a public utility every
car in home would be self-sufficient
unto itself and it is a whole new world
now we
had that world before I was born we
don&#39;t have it yet
and as a result we&#39;ve decamp tin the
Middle East with our hegemony and now
we&#39;re facing World War three so there
are consequences to this kind of secrecy
unintended and some are intended but the
unintended consequences are really about
blowing back on us hard right now both
physically geo physically
environmentally Maggio politically and
militarily it&#39;s a very dangerous thing
to fort the development of normal
technologies to be used for peaceful
purposes now that&#39;s the big caveat use
them for peaceful purposes now
eventually one of the things that
happened along the lines of this was how
do we keep all this secret well wet
works kill people compartmentalization
unacknowledged special access projects
nobody outside the project knows a big
one is ridiculed I have a document from
1950s where they talked about engaging
Disney Studios which had done a lot of
the OSS propaganda films in World War
two and Walt Disney was an asset of the
CIA and believe it or not I mean your
own thinks of cartoons but so they they
were going to it they engaged Disney
Studios to make flying saucer and little
green men films you know ha ha ha and it
ridiculed the subject so that
respectable people would say well you&#39;re
a kook if you&#39;re dealing with UFOs and
ETS you and that was done deliberately
and this was part of what I refer to or
in that earlier document the
psychological warfare value of the
subject how do you create the
psychological nexus so that the subject
becomes subject non grata like a person
not persona non grata it&#39;s a subject non
grata its unwelcome it has ridicule
associated with it and an Air Force
Major told me who&#39;s one of our
disclosure project witnesses who was
president when we shot and killed an ETA
on the tarmac at McGuire Field there in
New Jersey as testimonies
quite riveting if you&#39;ve read the
materials and you know he was saying
look they&#39;re really the way this has
been kept secret more than anything is
just sheer ridicule nobody wants to be
laughed at everyone doesn&#39;t everyone&#39;s
concern what their friends might think
because you know where&#39;s the tinfoil hat
you&#39;re supposed to be wearing
so this ridicule got ramped up in 1953
the psychological warfare programs so by
time you know we came on the stage gee
we&#39;re 60 some you know 50 60 years into
a whole of ridicule and denial and
countermeasures and everything else that
how do you fix this you know it&#39;s very
difficult because most reporters and
media people don&#39;t want to be ridiculed
nor do scientific and people and
professors and government folks I mean
there&#39;s so many people in the Congress
I&#39;ve met with very interested no this is
real I&#39;ll say will you hold a hearing on
this they go oh no it&#39;d be the end of my
career I&#39;d be lab be the laughingstock
I&#39;d be Senator Moonbeam or congressman
you know tinfoil hat or whatever so that
ridicule which was ramped up in the 50s
has been very effective incredibly
effective and and that&#39;s one of the hard
problems I faced this well although you
know as an a medical doctor luckily I
was known as a very good emergency
doctor before I got on Larry King Live
and started doing stuff like this but
they&#39;ve been the other way around I
probably would have never been hired
really yes oh well I was careful in my
timing because I did have a family of
four children to support luckily they&#39;re
all out of college now so now the next
thing I want to it the next document if
you move on from Marilyn Monroe&#39;s
tragedy and we will be time at the end
of today for you to ask questions I&#39;m
sure your your mind must be swirling
buddy now about a lot of things and this
is a
the next document is the Peterson memo
Arlington Institute so this is the
meeting that never happened with me in
the CIA director very interesting look
at the date third of December 1993 the
meeting between me and the sitting CIA
director was the 13th of December 1993
and is that document up and the CIA
director are james Woolsey who when
information about my meeting came out
after he had left office denied it ever
happened
luckily I could call him in a
flat-footed lie I always tell people in
Washington how do you know that these
politicians and lawyers were lying their
lips are moving their lips are moving
their line I know it&#39;s very cynical
thing to say but unfortunately very true
but this document which I&#39;m not going to
go all the way through but some of the
some of the information is very very
important I talked to Woolsey this
morning he suggested getting together
underline his underlying project
starlight that&#39;s referred to here was
the coalition I put together before the
disclosure project which no one knew
about where I was trying to get the
president President Clinton to lead the
disclosure on this and they it&#39;s a very
interesting document cause on the second
page it says remember the most powerful
people in the world will have a deep
compelling interest in our activities
and we use everything in italics at
their disposal to affect their
objectives very threatening and then he
suggests that I get an encrypted
portable phone because my kitchen
doesn&#39;t have one I mean the whole thing
is like such now Here I am of course you
know I&#39;m like 30-some years old I&#39;m an
emergency doctor and I&#39;m being asked to
come up and brief the city and CIA
director because and if you read this
carefully it states in there he&#39;s made
inquiries and no one&#39;s telling him
anything
this is a sitting director of the CIA
this is the proof the meeting took place
now there are other proof now what what
what the hell is going on that a sitting
CIA director doesn&#39;t know anything about
the most top-secret CIA project illegal
outrageous unconstitutional criminal and
when I found this out now remember this
is 22 years ago almost it was a shock to
me because I was raised like most people
I thought you know well there&#39;s a
president there are all these spooks and
there&#39;s a chain of command and it
operates I didn&#39;t know about
unacknowledged special access projects I
certainly could not have imagined that
the man who puts together the
presidential daily briefing would be
kept secret on stuff that I had
collected unbelievable amounts of
evidence for the existence of UFOs
extraterrestrial intelligence etc and so
on but that was the case and when I met
with this man for nearly three hours he
became quite clear to me that it was not
a prevarication I really thought that he
was saying that just his way of blowing
me off or you know not blowing me off it
sort of saying ah you know I want to
meet with you to find out what you know
but I actually do know and I&#39;m gonna
pretend like I don&#39;t know know this man
and my wife can attest to this was
shaken to his foundation the cover story
for the meeting was a dinner party in
their DC area which is typical the wives
were invited as cover terrible thing to
say but it&#39;s true so my wife is there I
was there the CI director and his wife
who&#39;s chief operating officer of
National Academy of Sciences was there
and my host John Peterson and his wife
interestingly she didn&#39;t know who has
come in to dinner until that afternoon
he wouldn&#39;t tell her and then she finds
out like two hours before we appear
there&#39;s this UFO expert in the CIA
director and his wife come in for dinner
he imagine being that wife I was an
interrupter that night was an
interesting conversation after we all
left but that&#39;s how these things were
done the real tragedy of it though is
that if you have a breakdown in
government this severe those of you who
are students at governance where you can
have a CIA director or senior members of
the military who are being left out of
something very important and which
hundreds of billions of dollars per year
are going into then you have no
government so the deep national security
state from 1950s until today has
devolved into this Sabrosa
unacknowledged intern not international
transnational entity with representation
in the UK Canada Australia Brazil China
Russia former Soviet Union which on this
issue worked together like this it is
not responsive to the body politic it is
not responsive to the heads of
government or even the heads of
committees and cabinet level people
there are some cabinet level people
however who have known I mentioned a few
there was a CIA director known as George
HW Bush and the CIA headquarters is now
named after him he was a member and is a
member of magic but then there are
others like Woolsey who who weren&#39;t
wouldn&#39;t be told anything
some presidents had been given a little
information and some have been told
nothing why well here&#39;s how it works
it took me a long time to figure out
something very simple I call this a soul
biopsy mm-hmm
because doctors are talked about
biopsies but it&#39;s a psychological
analysis so let&#39;s say this gentleman is
the incoming director of the CIA the
outgoing director of the CIA&#39;s me as
incoming director of the CIA they&#39;ve
taken your life apart and they know what
your values are if your values are that
you would not go along with an illegal
criminal unconstitutional effort and
engage in assassinations that were
illegal and other things they will never
tell you about this and even if you&#39;re
the president that&#39;s incoming this is
what happened to Jimmy Carter and I know
this for a fact
Jimmy Carter got elected and the
outgoing CIA director was guess ooh
George HW Bush George HW Bush when he
was called in and they had the
transition meeting for between November
and January when they had the transition
and they&#39;re standing up the new cabinet
was asked personally face-to-face by
Jimmy Carter and I&#39;ve met with someone
who was there about the UFO issue and
Bush said I&#39;m not gonna tell you in a
very derisively about that go see if you
can get it from the Congressional
Research Service literally brushed him
off and Carter was stunned because
Carter had had a UFO sighting when he
was governor of Georgia
I have his report form that he filed
officially signed Jimmy Carter he ran in
1976 on ending UFO secrecy actually so
he put together a White House study on
UFOs which we have disclosure project
witnesses that attest there too and they
were reaching out to Stanford Research
International to do s RI to do the study
for them because they couldn&#39;t get
anything from out
CIA director Bush and that entity SR I
had some people come in and threatened
them and said basically if you want to
receive any more contracts from the
Department of Defense or the US
government you will refuse to do this
study for the White House we have that
as an affidavit sign from someone
involved so um now this is very
extraordinary but it&#39;s we have documents
to prove it so Carter was boxed out of
this and not long ago he was at a
signing ceremony signing guitars in
Spain to raise money for the Carter
Center a few years ago and a very
well-known I think the same Shawn
Williams well-known classical guitarist
who&#39;s on our team was there and said you
know at dinner someone asked the Carter
what was it like to be the most powerful
man in the world in ghent know President
Carter said I don&#39;t think I was that man
and everyone&#39;s just thought he was
joking and he said well there are
certain things I wasn&#39;t allowed to know
about and someone very in a ridiculing
way said ha ha ha what like UFOs and
President Carter said yes that and more
referring to these energy and Technology
things and so Carter wasn&#39;t joking and
it is true that he did not get access
the whole time he was president because
he would have ended the secrecy and they
knew it
it&#39;s also why he was a one-term
president now we had after him Ronald
Reagan or ray gun as I call him or a way
so a colonel who reached out to me was
one of the guys who putting together the
SDI Strategic Defense Initiative Star
Wars and he actually met with Carter and
Reagan Carter was a hard sell Reagan was
a soft sell on the billions to go into
its
now the way it worked is that the Star
Wars was always a cover story for
targeting in space interstellar vehicles
using these scalar weapons not lasers
not if it&#39;s at the speed of light is not
fast enough
everything important is faster than the
speed of light and so what happened is
that he at that point got convinced they
sent just the right people in to
convince Reagan that there was an
existential alien threat
basically what Bernhard von Braun warned
on his deathbed about which we&#39;ll get to
in a moment
and so Reagan bought into it that&#39;s why
you can google this at the UN he said
wouldn&#39;t our job of uniting the world be
easier if we could unite against the
common alien threat I&#39;m paraphrasing
being look this up actually Bill Clinton
recently said that on Jimmy Kimmel
something very similar the reason that
happens is because there is a prevailing
need for people who are in certain
positions to be given what is I call
targeted and tailor-made disinformation
information that is geared towards
scaring the hell out of them so they go
along with the agenda of militarism as
opposed to peaceful contact with these
civilizations and it&#39;s very not hard to
do if you have a certain orientation if
you have a certain mindset based on fear
xenophobia us-versus-them that whole
mindset so that&#39;s really the criteria
whether someone is put in the loop of
this secrecy in government or not has to
do with what their values are what their
psychological profile is whether they
will go along with the agenda of secrecy
if they will not go along with the
agenda of secrecy you&#39;re not going to
they&#39;re not going tell you anything I
don&#39;t care if you are the President of
the United States with a CIA director or
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff but there are have been people who
do know in those same positions why
because they were willing to go along
with this Shekinah
now is the next document you can put up
it&#39;s just a partial list of the sort of
VIPs and government official I briefed
it&#39;s goes three pages long it&#39;s 50 60 70
and this is just a few a few of them
every single one of these people without
exception and you can scroll down
through them and just flip through I&#39;m
not going to go through them all we
don&#39;t have time there&#39;s a lot of work
having private meetings with this many
people every single one of these people
from Senator Claiborne Pell to the CIA
director to the head of intelligence for
the joint chat staff to the head of the
Defense Intelligence Agency the biggest
intelligence gathering entity and the
Pentagon every single one of these
people wanted to know that had been
denied access to these unacknowledged
special access projects every single one
of them that is the proof we have if we
ever had to go to court to prove that
the operation is illegal and these
people the ones still living would be
subpoenaed because believe me and I have
more one of them that you see on page
two here is Lord Hill Norton and if you
go to this next document this is the
five-star Admiral how many people have
heard of Lord Hill Norton he&#39;s actually
a great guy he passed away not long ago
I don&#39;t mind sharing these these couple
letters I have a whole file with him
he asked me to come to his estate in
England and briefed him back and I
believe it was 1990s some time and he
was a 5-story Admiral what they used to
call C Lord and Lord Hill Norton is that
the one that the right one yeah he had
found out through other sources that
UFOs were real and that there was a big
operation in the UK that was this
transnational deep national security
state working with the British but he
was head of the ministry of the
and as such was head of mi5 and mi6 he
was also head of the Military Committee
for NATO he had no knowledge of these
projects the entire time he was in
government and when I met with him at
his cottage and you know what&#39;s kind of
cute about it at the second document if
you go to the next one he says I
thoroughly enjoyed our talk when you
came in August this was an August of I
guess it was 1995 and I am grateful to
you for your time I read all the
materials you left me and I intend to
read it all again I also shared it with
countess Mireille who shares our
interest I have an idea you may have met
her some time ago I meet a lot of folks
I find your latest brief on the national
security Intel invitations of the UFO
subjects very clear and very convincing
and it goes on it&#39;s a beautiful letter
and things he was going to do with the
European Parliament and whatnot he he
died not being able to accomplish as
much as he wanted to with the British
government because I had to explain to
him why he never knew anything about
this and it&#39;s a very hard thing to sit
with someone like a CIA director or
someone like this who&#39;s one of the most
powerful people in the military and
intelligence field in the world and tell
them you just were not in the loop and
he basically said to me well why didn&#39;t
they tell me and it was he was all hurt
and kind of petulant I said sir I&#39;m
gonna answer your question with a
question what would you have done if
you&#39;d found out there was a
transnational entity unacknowledged
running unconstitutionally in your
country and mine engaging in
assassinations keeping from the planet
technologies that would save the earth
from environmental destruction and
eliminate poverty within a generation
and that they are using these
technologies to try to provoke as
ulzzang provocateurs an interstellar
conflict and world war 3
and that they were completely off the
reservation without any controls from
the chief executive or the legitimate
governments of the world and he hopped
up and down he&#39;s this little oozes
little guy with piercing blue he says I
wouldn&#39;t have stood for a for a bloody
minute I saw what that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t
tell you he says what do you mean he
thought I was being in person because
they knew you wouldn&#39;t go along with
that agenda
therefore you are out of the loop that&#39;s
how it works it&#39;s that simple
so you basically accumulate people who
are enormous ly evil and who want to see
terrible damage done to the planet
because at their core they love war and
they love conflict they do not want
peace to break out as one of them said
to me heaven forbid we should have peace
on this planet too many people would be
out of business too many of us would be
out of business very cynical but true
the next document is from one of my
advisors to Admiral Tom Wilson and it&#39;s
about setting up a briefing for him and
I only put this up here for some people
have challenged me did you really have
meetings with folks like this yes
absolutely and it was on my birthday in
1995 the first letter was written I
ended up meeting with him in 97 in April
but he helped us in a number of ways
prior to that as did this admiral kramer
who set up my meetings at
wright-patterson Air Force Base the
facility to which the crash D T remains
went in 1940s in Dayton Ohio and this
meeting was another one where I was able
to provide to him some very important
information prior to the meeting
including a 1991 document which has not
been Declassified
and I&#39;ll go to that one next it&#39;s the
National Reconnaissance Office document
and that document is basically a
security alert and the reason it&#39;s
important is not so much for its content
or on the next page which is a warning
that a group of UFO buffs we&#39;re trying
to penetrate the perimeter of area 51
so it&#39;s called nobody calls it that
really is it the Nellis range but this
was generated and you can see the date
July 1991 and take a note of the
distribution list please and we&#39;re gonna
get back to that in a moment
but it&#39;s a security blue fire which is a
codename 1991 commanders net royal Ops
cosmic ops so cosmic clearance you&#39;ve
heard of this not a myth it&#39;s real magic
ops Magi as the majority as the magic
Maj IC ops and it goes to a whole bunch
of them Nell&#39;s division all these code
numbers and you get down to some really
interesting things
MOC is military operating center an MOA
as a military operating area and SOG is
a special operations team but you get
into red flag dark east dart south Popat
Mesa Sally corridor Groom Lake dreamland
blackjack team blackjack control is at
the Edwards complex in in California
roulette team at protec seaspray and
others now it&#39;s not clear to me when I
who gave me this why they blacked out a
couple of things maybe it was things
that they were involved with personally
and they didn&#39;t want to get fingered but
this a secret document went to the
Admiral prior to our meeting and he
actually recognized one of these
entities and he may
inquiry and it was being run by a
contractor we&#39;re gonna get to these dis
next and the contractor when these
corporate contractors when he called
them up he said I&#39;m Admiral Tom Wilson
at that time he was head of intelligence
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff I want to
be read into this project guess what
happened they said sir you don&#39;t have a
need to know now this is the guy who
puts together the intelligence briefings
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the
United States he was sold you don&#39;t have
a need-to-know
and Admiral Wilson said god damn it if I
don&#39;t have a need to know who does they
said sir we cannot discuss this with you
further they hung up and blocked his
line now this all happened before the
stand-up meeting I did were bagger
Mitchell the sixth man to walk on the
moon and myself and my military adviser
and a few other people met with the
Admiral and a stand up what&#39;s called a
stand-up brief and I was doing the
presenting that was supposed to be 45
minutes that went for two or three hours
he kept canceling appointments
downstream this was at the Pentagon and
so I said well you know sir that don&#39;t
feel bad he looked at me so who else is
in this situation where this group is
blocking access who are in the national
security apparatus I said well the
president the CIA director etc I started
naming them and he was just the fear in
his eyes the palpable fear and anger
that something this important that is
real and legitimate he knew it was could
escape the oversight of folks who have
the security of the United States in
their hands but basically they&#39;re trying
to navigate without IFR they&#39;re trying
to navigate without radar through the
dangers of the world because the most
important technologies and the most
important information and the most
critical national security secrets are
completely off they&#39;re out of there
scope off their radar and yet they&#39;re
responsible for keeping America safe and
they&#39;re responsible for protecting us
and they&#39;re responsible for responding
to threats and so at the end of the
meeting I asked him I said well Admiral
do you think you can help us and he just
set back in his hair this big cherry
setback he says oh he says look he says
what I&#39;ve learned from this meeting is
that there is an illegal operation that
has hundreds of billions of dollars in
over the years trillions that has
technologies they can do circles around
my b-2 stealth bomber which is the best
thing I know about how am I going to
take them on and I said well it can&#39;t be
through a military engagement it has to
be through infiltration it has to be
through convincing them to come he says
I don&#39;t know how to do that I had they
won&#39;t give me access and moreover I
can&#39;t take any action unless the
president authorizes it and at that time
the president was Bill Clinton and I
said well no he won&#39;t do that he says
why he says well we briefed the
president and his best friend came to my
home and said that if he did this he
would end up like Jack Kennedy and I&#39;m
quoting he&#39;s as well there you are then
point set match and I said well you know
someone&#39;s got to do it invariably these
people say well you can do it and I
learned if you look at there&#39;s a movie
my wife and I saw this past week called
bridge of spies and you realize there&#39;s
this attorney named Donovan in it it&#39;s a
true story based on the Gary Powers you
to shoot down and he was sort of the
expendable guy I&#39;m the expendable guy
I&#39;m the guy doesn&#39;t matter they get
killed because I&#39;m basically that&#39;s what
Clinton&#39;s people told me doesn&#39;t matter
if you get killed we don&#39;t want the
President to get killed so I mean I know
that&#39;s ugly but it&#39;s the truth
so so so that&#39;s why I&#39;m doing it so this
document the reason it&#39;s so critical is
that it actually has the action one this
is the first document
on the top of the large briefing that
President Obama got when he became
president and John Podesta who is his
guy who put together the Obama White
House was the man that we provided this
for because the Podesta has publicly
come out as you know in favor of
disclosure and ending secrecy so
basically it was for me to Podesta to
Obama and of course I mean I didn&#39;t
expect Obama to be able to do anything
about it because having these project
code numbers and being president doesn&#39;t
give you access control you know
difference between knowledge of
something and access control you can
know about something but if you if
they&#39;re not if they&#39;re non-responsive to
your orders like they were to this
Admiral it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a
general or the President or a CIA
director because they&#39;re basically gonna
say buzz off we have more power than you
do and go away and that&#39;s how it
operates that is how it operates this is
naked raw power that&#39;s how it works so
this next document I want to share
unfortunately this is did not come out
it&#39;s the congressman Cox as you know he
was SEC head secretary for W Bush but
back when he was a congressman from
Orange County a good friend of mine who
knew him set up a briefing between me
and the congressman at his offices in
Orange County and he was on several key
committees Armed Services Committee etc
and so on
and he wanted to know about the UFO
issue and I said okay well I&#39;ll come in
and I&#39;ll brief you and he said well this
has never been brought up at a briefing
I said no you wouldn&#39;t be because the my
brief members personally of the Senate
Intelligence Committee and Foreign
Relations Committee and Health
Government Oversight Chairman and
everyone you can think of personally
face-to-face and in every case they have
been completely without access and when
they make an inquiry they&#39;re told no
such project exists it doesn&#39;t exist
it&#39;s unacknowledged unacknowledged
doesn&#39;t exist and he says well I would
like to know he&#39;s
where the heck are these things going on
and who are the corporate entities and
where the basis so that was the genesis
of the famous Cox memo which you know
became kind of infamous because I wrote
it to him and I basically did a sub
subject of a brief summary of the people
who i briefed who don&#39;t know and a
course of action that he needs to take
unfortunately that document didn&#39;t come
out it&#39;s gotten scrambled by the
electronic gremlins in the computer
unless he&#39;s fixed it he hasn&#39;t so so
basically I described who is not able to
do this and but where the places are and
that was the genesis of this which is
the facilities list and I want to go
through this very quickly of the where
the key facilities are now keep in mind
these are all run by a hybridized entity
it&#39;s part government unacknowledged
special access project compartmented
deep black trans national security state
and three-quarters corporate the action
is in the corporate sector but at each
of these bases there are contractors who
run the operations do you understand how
this works in other words the government
doesn&#39;t do that much the government does
double UFO work for others so they issue
contracts so you&#39;ll have Bechtel
corporation or you&#39;ll have Lockheed
Martin or you&#39;ll have whatever so but
the key facilities I want to go through
and there are others this is a list that
I&#39;ve updated ated it for the President
and oh nine a very chief one is Edwards
Air Force Base and there&#39;s a whole
constellation there haystack Butte China
Lakes Gorge Air Force Base they retired
Norton Air Force Base table top mountain
observatory which is run ostensibly by
NASA and blackjack control so I had a
source at blackjack control associated
with the
Edwards related facilities but the
blackjack team you saw on that list was
an Ellis
so there&#39;s blackjack control and
blackjack team and then there are air
space facilities and these are all dumbs
deep underground military bases or ug
B&#39;s for short underground bases Northrop
the anthill Teton ranch McDonnell
Douglas the Llano plant Lockheed Martin
Helen Dell the Phillips Labs and the
North edwards facility and I will add
that since then a newer facility called
the cube which is up past lancaster
palmdale up in the high desert outside
of now in the edwards range and
classified airspace is a Lockheed Martin
skunkworks facility where the
state-of-the-art R&amp;D is going on keep in
mind that Lockheed and Northrop have
multiple generations since 1954 of what
you would call a UFO manmade UFO that
are as the head of the Lockheed
skunkworks said to several people on my
team including Jan Harz and the new head
of a MUFON the mutual UFO network he&#39;s
IBM executive that&#39;s retired I&#39;ve been
friends with him since the 20s I mean
the putt that&#39;s when he&#39;s since the 90s
he is a man who is of great integrity
and he actually was at the meeting along
with several other my friends when when
Ben riched the head of the Lockheed
skunkworks a super-secret where the u-2
spy plane and that movie came from said
we can take e.t home we already have the
technologies to take e.t home and ended
his presentation with a slide show of a
black disc
going out into space sounds fantastic no
it&#39;s not is the head of the Lockheed
skunkworks so we&#39;re flying around on
jets which are basically a vacuum tube
this pressurized with a bomb a
pre-positioned bomb called explosive jet
fuel a that you&#39;re flying on thousands
of gallons of when we have had these
things since the 50s
how ridiculous
we&#39;re sending our astronauts up on
rockets that blow up and kill them like
the shuttle astronauts when we&#39;ve had
these things since the 50s this is
criminal is outrageous but that&#39;s the
way it is so this is how its developed
and then I just wanted to let you know
that this new facility the cube is I
have an engineer that I&#39;ve met with who
works in that facility and they work on
not just the propulsion systems but also
the electronic warfare systems and the
bio nanotechnology which we&#39;ll get to
and it&#39;s a second after our break and
those are the things that the UFO retail
world of books and movies and
conferences would call aliens these are
man-made they have integrated circuits
in their brains and they walk around
their little gray or reptilian or creepy
looking things these are man-made 100%
and I know the men working on that but
the cube is associated as one facility
associated with those another facility
is Dulcie another one is Pine Gap so the
other of course they all you&#39;ve all
heard Nellis complex as area 51
more specifically it&#39;s s4 s9 and s12
those are compartmented areas you have
to have a password and biometrics to get
into them Mesa and area 19 and groom
Lake these are all things have been
provided to our government officials in
New Mexico you have the Los Alamos
National Laboratory it has an
underground connector underground that
goes to the Dulce complex which most
people don&#39;t think can really exist
because you go to Dulce there&#39;s nothing
there remember what this simple fact
nothing critical its above the surface
of the ground it&#39;s either in space or
it&#39;s underground
everything including White House
facilities and Pentagon everything
critical is underground the wall stands
and the Kirkland Air Force Base has the
Sandia National Laboratories and the
defense nuclear agency Phillips labs
again Monsanto Mountain weapons storage
facility and underground complex that
connects coyote Mountain Test Site north
end of
Manzano the white sands complex and
again the Dulce complex so the Kirkland
Air Force Base and that&#39;s outside of
course Albuquerque I&#39;ve been there in
Arizona key facility is Fort Huachuca
it&#39;s a underground base most of it
that&#39;s critical it&#39;s Army Intelligence
headquarters there is a storage facility
where a man as of the 1970s who was on
my team with work worked in it and at
that time they had nine extraterrestrial
spacecraft that had been down using
these electromagnetic pulse scalar
weapons and a whole lot of different et
species that were frozen there and
that&#39;s at Fort Huachuca ironically near
tombstone and there the other ones that
I just want to mention Cheyenne Mountain
which is under the mountain in Colorado
Springs has a has a dedicated area for
just the Deep Space Network tracking of
interstellar x&#39; that are in our solar
system and one of my military advisors a
man who&#39;s been in many of these
unacknowledged special access projects
actually was in that facility and got to
see this console 50 where they had
tracked and he said that they had
tracked an object at that time that was
in our solar system that was 26 miles in
diameter
an artificial ety object moving as he
put it under its own steam is a Navy guy
I said I don&#39;t think it&#39;s working with
steam but yeah you&#39;re right
another critical facility is the
Lawrence Livermore labs the Pine Gap
underground facility in Australia I have
a picture actually of the above-ground
facility there that a man who worked
there sent to me the Redstone Arsenal
underground complex in Alabama
this also has association with the
Marshall Space Flight Center and in Utah
I won the most critical and this is the
most critical one that&#39;s new is the
Dugway proving grounds outside of Provo
and this is classified airspace above
and no
that&#39;s by ground above ground you don&#39;t
see much and everything is underground
richard foix this naval research labs
official was out there with some
generation five or six or whatever night
scopes doing an operation and he looked
out him and he saw these objects coming
out from underground that then zipped
over and that were these massive discs
in triangular shape
anti-gravity objects that were powers
and some were just sitting out there
watching him and that&#39;s outside of Provo
out in the desert so that is a very key
and that one is mostly manned by folks
who are part of the Mormon corporate
Empire which if I were to rank who has
what kind of say-so over policy on this
that would rank certainly ahead of the
President or Congress I wants to comment
further than that this is not to make an
aspersion to rank-and-file Mormons just
as this is how that operation works the
agencies in the US government are
associated with this AF OSI Air Force
Office of Special Investigations of
course compartmented operations at CIA
the Defense Advanced Research Project
administration the Defense Intelligence
Agency now notwithstanding i briefed the
general who was head of it he wasn&#39;t
given any information but we have
disclosure project witnesses who are DIA
assigned contractors who had were very
involved in ET and UFO technology issues
certain compartmented operations at the
FBI being tightly held and every
Military Intelligence Division Army Air
Force Navy have compartment it
acknowledged operations that feed into
this magic committee the National
Reconnaissance Office National Security
Agency again a very compartmented
operation certainly nothing that Edward
Snowden had access to to my knowledge
although it&#39;s been asked and the various
Space command&#39;s private corporate
entities include BDM corporation Bechtel
corporation does most of the underground
base construction I know that the tunnel
being
built from Los Alamos over to Dulce for
years people heard you looking Google
this the Taos ta OS hum a lot of New
Agers thought it was like Gaia singing
or something I&#39;m going no there&#39;s a
massive nuclear-powered tunneling device
that was going from Los Alamos over to
Dulce and as it was going it goes
through bedrock and classifies it into
this massive tunnel that then anti
gravity electromagnetic vehicles
transport people people carriers
underneath the ground and as it was
going through that bedrock it caused
this vibration but that was being
operated by Bechtel and I was at a
meeting with Stephen Beck - Oh onsen you
know it&#39;s they are very key into Booz
Allen Hamilton of course is who Snowden
worked for but there are key contractor
they do have a compartment at operation
dealing with this Boeing aerospace EG&amp;G
very key facility for creating
electronics and also the
state-of-the-art nanotechnology implants
that are put into abduction victims
people that think they had contact with
ETS but they&#39;re actually being abducted
by military and corporate folks
assistance which is now a division of
Raytheon Lockheed Martin I&#39;ve mentioned
McDonnell Douglas is now part of Boeing
mitre corporation MIT are a very key in
terms of antigravity and high tech it&#39;s
here in the DC area in other places
North Grumman I mentioned Phillips labs
before Rockwell International SAIC as
the one the crown jewels
SAIC is a company science applications
international corporation Admiral Bobby
Ray Inman is a has for years been a
member of this magic committee along
with Dick Cheney and Papa Bush but SAIC
he had been National Security Agency
head he moved from national security
head over to the board of SAIC and in a
little Side Story interestingly when I
asked of Senator Barry Goldwater when I
was at his home some years ago and you
know he&#39;d run for president in 64 but he
always had an interest in this but had
never been taught anything
and he we started comparing notes of who
we knew and he said how can I help you I
said well if you could reach out to some
of these people on this magic committee
it&#39;d be great and so you know we named
some names he didn&#39;t know the ones I
mentioned and then he I said well
Admiral Bobby Ray Inman he says Oh Bobby
right we&#39;ve been friends for years
I said we&#39;ll get hold of him give him a
jingle would you so he did biggest
mistake of his life he got hold of me he
says I can&#39;t make any more phone calls
like that for you he tore me apart he
tore me a new one but admiral inman
definitely a magic number as our other
chief people on the SAIC but it&#39;s
compartmentalized so you know most
people work on conventional things
they&#39;re a TRW village supercomputing
Wackenhut security there&#39;s a lot of
security for magic and then there are
others as well so you know some of these
are ones most you know most people never
heard a lot of these corporations
they&#39;re huge and they have enormous
reach and I think that what you have to
understand is that there is certainly
not limited to that list but it feeds
into a system and most people don&#39;t even
understand how it works and I always
tell people go back and look at the
interview
Denise McKenzie worked for SAIC she got
a job there isn&#39;t it sort of clerical
administrative person she was in an
office it&#39;s kind of like the Mafia
you know how the Mafia will have like a
pizza parlor or some little shop and
they&#39;ll come in and you know that&#39;s the
storefront and but it&#39;s actually
laundering money and they&#39;re doing their
drugs and pimps through the backdoor
that&#39;s how this works
so she was in this office at SAIC and it
was an Aussie it was you know I&#39;m
running multi-million dollar contracts
for the US government and she said what
is this there&#39;s nothing going on here
and she went to this file cabinet and
there was just all these dummied up
reports that would go back to Capitol
Hill to justify the money and when she
started asking about it they said don&#39;t
ask about this and what what she
basically was told this office receives
the money we generate false reports back
to the President and to Congress that
money then passes out of this office to
a black project dealing with UFOs
electronics anti-gravity stuff like this
so when you get to some of the
accounting I&#39;ve met recently with a big
one the big four accounting firms they
said yeah this is exactly how it works
if you go to though they&#39;ll basically
say here&#39;s what we&#39;re doing and if you
try to penetrate further to actually get
to a granular level or where the money
is going they&#39;ll say well you don&#39;t have
a need to know that&#39;s a top secret
special compartment in intelligence and
and basically you have to take their
word for it so it all gets
rubber-stamped by the big four auditing
firms but it&#39;s very illegal you&#39;ll
remember in the film serious Donald
Rumsfeld the day before 9/11 I&#39;m not
sure he knew he was being filmed said
two point three trillion dollars
unaccounted for recently I heard found
out from a good source it&#39;s eight point
five trillion now so there&#39;s eight point
five trillion dollars that have
basically been embezzled misappropriated
used without the knowledge of the
Congress or the president that&#39;s a lot
of money even for America so that is
exactly how it operates but if you take
that one little example from SAIC and
multiply it through all these
corporations and all these different
government offices that&#39;s how the
funding mechanism works there that makes
sense the folks so I hope that made
sense to you guys I&#39;m going to say let&#39;s
take about a 15 minute break to stretch
and to have a bathroom break and when we
come back I&#39;m gonna go back into deep
knowledge of how the funding works and
really what the agenda is behind the
secrecy thank you very much all right
so if someone up there can they ask
people to come have a seat thank you
hope you guys had a stretch your legs a
little bit I know this is a long
presentation but it needs to be
so thank you I&#39;m glad everyone made it
back so in the next hour and 45 minutes
I want to cover enough material so that
you might have a few questions at the
end you probably have a few thousand
questions already
one thing I want to go into just very
quickly is the key role that control
systems play within the media and the
scientific community now this sort of
surprises a lot of people and some
people are not surprised first let&#39;s
deal with science one thing you have to
remember about science is that
scientists are humans first and
scientists second right all of us and
there are scientists who pose as
objective scientific folks who are on
the payroll of various agencies for
example in this cache of documents I had
I received it was a very famous asteroid
astronomer astrophysicist at Harvard
named dr. Donald Menzel and Menzel was
the chief UFO debunker who went around
telling people none of this existed in
the 1960s and all through that era and
he was on many panels and he was the
person who would look at evidence and
then say not true not true not true it
turned out I have a document from the
CIA where it talks about their contract
with dr. Donald Menzel at Harvard and it
said but they cannot be acknowledged
that he is being paid by us because the
public needs to believe that he&#39;s an
objective scientist telling the public
from the perch of respectability at
Harvard that this isn&#39;t true so until
the time of his death this wasn&#39;t known
now in this cache of documents I got
1994 officially released by the CIA the
provenance of this document is not in
question it names them so just
extrapolate that out
how easy it is to do that same thing
with a guy named professor Condon
professor Condon was the head of the
condom committee at the University of
Colorado that had a contract in 1969 to
look into UFOs so that the Air Force
could determine whether the close
project Bluebook or not Project Blue
Boar was actually a public relations
stunt mostly to collect information from
the public because there was so much
outcry from the public of sightings and
things that had happened and the public
particularly congressman Gerald Ford at
the time was furious that they were
debunking events that had happened in
Michigan that his constituents said were
absolutely right there here et Kraft
right here and dr. J Allen Hynek who who
later came clean was also an
astrophysicist made the famous commented
it was swamp gas and later of course he
said we knew it was in swamp gas we knew
it was et craft and he left project brew
Bluebook as their chief consultant and
started the Center for UFO studies there
in Chicago but professor Condon around
this time was asked to head up an
objective scientific committee to look
into whether there was anything for any
veracity to UFOs it was there was a lot
of publicity around it and like all
government committees it&#39;s always when
they form a committee they already have
it it&#39;s a done deal
it&#39;s just window dressing so he headed
up this committee a lot of scientific
people and dr. robert wood cornell PhD
worked for McDonnell Douglas now part of
Boeing and actually dr. wood who is one
of our disclosure project witnesses it
told me in SNR his very lengthy
testimony I have you have to understand
I have hundreds of hours of this kind of
testimony on videotape when he was
working for a McDonnell Douglas old man
McDonald himself
asked him to look into UFOs and gather
evidence and so he began to do this and
he discovered a number of things at a
they were real be they were
interplanetary sea they were using a
type of gravity control propulsion and D
most interestingly and many of the
things that he looked looked into he
found that the ETS had electronic
devices that were what I call technology
assisted consciousness and consciousness
assisted technologies meaning that there
was a transdimensional nexus between the
electronics of these communication
devices I mean you know this goes at the
speed of light it&#39;s this junk really
it&#39;s 1800s technology and you know
there&#39;s the Morse code
no offense Apple but but they had
technologies that interface seamlessly
with electronics that would pick up
directed intended thought and which is
absolutely true and actually the founder
of Facebook Zuckerberg is are talking
about a fault switch to interface with
computers I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s been
reading my material but anyway I started
writing about that in 1990 1991 and when
dr. wood saw my comprehensive assessment
of the UFO subject which was written in
91 it got kind of moved through the
agency in the aerospace community and I
was just starting this project very
obscure at that time just this country
doctor in North Carolina rattling around
in an ER and it made its way over to
McDonnell Douglas and I got this phone
call from dr. wood and he said you have
no idea how right you are
how do you know this I said well I&#39;ve
had contact and it&#39;s quite obvious I
mean if you&#39;ve any thinking person
you&#39;re not dealing with electronics that
are the speed of light or travel that&#39;s
the speed of lights too slow because
some of these are from other galaxies
like the picture we have of that one
et that is from Andromeda two and a half
million light-years from here right you
know they&#39;re not getting here at the
speed of light it take two and a half
million years to get here so he said
well I really
meet with you at some point so we kept
in our this relationship and he
eventually told me that when he was
doing this work for McDonnell Douglas in
the 60s that he was put on the condom
committee because they fought because he
was a very prestigious aerospace tie at
a major aerospace company that he would
be go along with the debunking whitewash
of the Condon committee and dr. wood was
someone who started bringing in
boatloads of evidence and it was turning
the committee to the fact no these are
absolutely real it&#39;s a professor Condon
went to old man MacDonald head of
McDonnell Douglas aerospace and said
you&#39;d fired that son of a so I get
him off this committee and mr. McDonald
said no I&#39;m not gonna fire him he&#39;s a
very good man but he was thrown off the
common committee but he didn&#39;t lose his
job I McDonald stood by him and that&#39;s
that&#39;s a absolutely true story and it
came out in this cache of documents from
the CIA my god in 94 that Professor
Condon and that committee some of the
key people were on the payroll of the
CIA and is in black and white is an
uncontested document University of
Colorado Boulder prestigious aerospace
guy and he was carrying water and doing
the bidding of the intelligence
community all the time masquerading as
an objective scientist so this is why
you know I have said like seth shostack
and those people who are with SETI the
search for extraterrestrial intelligence
they are either the stupidest people in
the world or they&#39;re on the payroll of
somebody to lie to the public you cannot
be that stupid given the dispositive
evidence we put out there and I actually
debated on Voice of America the head of
the SETI project says szostak and I and
I had my disclosure project witnesses
there we basically cleaned his clock
because the evidence is so dispositive
and overwhelming if you go through our
material archive but this happens all
the time so if you just extrapolate that
those couple of examples throughout the
professorial class and scientific class
it&#39;s how it&#39;s done now in some cases
it&#39;s done
not for payment so much as to protect
your own reputation for example there
was a guy named Carl Sagan everybody
hurt know who he is
you know cosmos series and all that he
actually was on the payroll of the
intelligence community and what happened
is that Carl Sagan there were some
improprieties and his PhD thesis which
led to the intelligence community
reaching out to him and they basically
said you&#39;re gonna tell the public what
we&#39;re gonna tell you to tell the public
or you&#39;re gonna be washing the floors at
Cornell you&#39;re not gonna be a professor
and a good friend of his two of his
friends
George Fennell who co-founded the
extrasolar planetary society and founded
the Allegheny Observatory outside
Pittsburgh who&#39;s on my team James
Mulaney who is a very eminent astronomer
who was the editor of kind telescope
magazine and astronomy magazine
confirmed to me that this happened to
Carl Sagan and and and they were one of
them told me that he basically aged 30
years and a month because he had the
soul hit sell his soul to the devil and
so he went from someone looking into
UFOs and actually said some positive
things about the reality to be an
achieve debunker of them and that was a
real tragedy because they had what&#39;s
called Oppo research opposition research
like a political party had they had dirt
on him then they used it to turn him but
to the public you know he was this
renowned respected scientific figure so
just magnify that all through society
that&#39;s how it operates and I know it&#39;s
not a very pretty picture is a little
cynical it&#39;s not cynical it&#39;s just a
reality people need to his childhoods
end here today wake up this is how the
world actually works it&#39;s it&#39;s
bare-knuckle time and that&#39;s one of the
big problems is that it the same thing
happens in the media everyone thinks we
have a free press we don&#39;t have a pre
pro wait we have a free press about
things like the stain on the blue dress
or something like that or other you know
Kardashian&#39;s wardrobe but on anything
really critical like this we do not have
a free press and I can give you many
many many examples I&#39;ll only give you a
couple and this involves both the
mainstream news media and another one
that involves Hollywood take this and
extrapolate it IRA Rosen one is Emmy
working with Mike Wallace at ABC News he
then became the executive producer ABC
News New York for primetime live in 2020
when we started moving forward with the
disclosure project he came out to my
farm in Virginia and came out with the
production team
I gave him thirty five hours of
top-secret testimony and countless
top-secret documents and he says either
this is the biggest hoax in the world or
the biggest story in human history and
he says I think it&#39;s the latter I said
it is he says we&#39;re gonna do a series of
town hall meetings with your witnesses
and we&#39;re gonna do a huge expose on this
I said I don&#39;t think ABC will let you in
he said I&#39;m the executive producer and I
had final decision over this I said IRA
I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll let you but I&#39;ll
cooperate here you know here&#39;s 20 years
of research and all this effort you have
it on a silver platter don&#39;t know
payment I&#39;m not a consultant I give
everything away for free so he goes back
to New York he takes me up there you
know there&#39;s Diane Sawyer and all these
well you know was interesting I said
well if you can make this happen it&#39;s
awesome so a couple weeks later he calls
me up rather sheepishly and he says dr.
Greer they&#39;re not gonna let me do this
story and I said well IRA I thought you
said you had total control over
programming for primetime why he says
dr. Greer
not for this and I said well who are
they
he says dr. Greer you know who they are
and that was the end of it and we&#39;ve
stayed in touch she&#39;s now back with
though 60 minutes but that was one of
the reasons why many of you may remember
that Mike Wallace went on Larry King
Live and had had a deep depressive
breakdown and he talked about that he
kept saying I was a fraud I&#39;m a fraud
and part of it is that a guy named
Schwartz who was on the board of time
life and I met and he was very good
friends with Mike Wallace and he Mike
Wallace had gotten ahold of a cache of
these documents and I was in New York at
a party and this the you know Bob
Schwartz said to me he says look he said
the media has become the scribe taking
dictation from the right hand of the
king and particularly on something like
this and so Mike Wallace who was this
esteemed investigative reporter couldn&#39;t
touch the biggest investigative
reporting story in history and he felt
like a total fraud and went to a deep
depression over it if you take Hollywood
the same thing happens the only movies
you really could see that come out
anymore
now Close Encounters of the Third Kind
by Spielberg was a docudrama he was
given access to some of the secret files
at wright-patterson Air Force Base and
it&#39;s true if you haven&#39;t seen that movie
go see it it&#39;s classic but in the modern
times that was in the 70s I think it
just isn&#39;t possible the studios are
completely mobbed up with people just
like these scientists who actually own
the payroll with people that respond to
the intelligence community so Arnold
cope Wilson was a huge producer had
multibillion-dollar and gross sales for
his movies flew me out to LA he wanted
to do an enormous expose a true life
story be like Argo
but based on might work and what I&#39;ve
done I&#39;d be a thriller with you know you
have murder you have mayhem you have
intrigue you have et contact you have
the whole thing he loved it and he was
there and I was that you know twentieth
Century Fox
he had a 60 million dollar discretionary
budget to do any movie he wanted
pre-approved because he was a big name
and I said well Arnold I don&#39;t think
they&#39;re gonna let you do this one he
says oh yes I&#39;m Arnold Coppola and I&#39;ve
done this and I he took me to his vanity
wall of all his awards I said great
wonderful give me a call so he sends one
of his chief assistants here to DC when
we&#39;re doing the private closed briefings
from members of Congress in April of
1997 and she cup goes back and he go he
goes Bullitt he said this is the most
incredible bunch of information because
we filmed all that and I so I let him
have that closed briefing film he says
this is gonna be the biggest movie it&#39;ll
be bigger than et or Close Encounters or
any of them and certainly would be
bigger than something like Avatar
I said well good do it so but I don&#39;t
know if they&#39;ll let you he says why do
you say that I said well let&#39;s see you
guys put it put it in part it started
down the path and let&#39;s see what happens
a few weeks later I get a call from
Arnold Koch Wilson he says dr. Greer
they won&#39;t let me do this movie I said
Oh Arnold I thought you had the 60
million dollars already in the bank
ready to roll he says not for this Fox
has killed it put it in turn around
faster than you&#39;ve had faster than 10
light years of light speed so it went
into turn around and got killed and turn
around means when you take a film and
basically kill it so that&#39;s what
happened and it&#39;s happened I give me
this exact if I&#39;d be here until tomorrow
morning giving you examples I&#39;ve had
with the media the mainstream media
where this happened over and over and
over again so one of the problems is the
big media do not allow certain things to
be exposed and we have been brainwashed
to think that we&#39;re the land of the free
and have a free press and a free market
etc but we do only within a certain
confines but ironically that confine is
a prison because how do you have a free
market if the most important
technologies and information of the last
hundred years is sequestered
and can&#39;t be used I mean it&#39;s not a free
market that&#39;s a managed market and
controlled and it is same thing with the
media so that&#39;s really how that works
and you need to understand that&#39;s a very
important component of how magic
infiltrates and operates and if and keep
that in mind whenever you start seeing a
major media report and now with the
internet we can put something out and it
can reach ironically we can put a video
out and it&#39;ll have 5 million views and
it&#39;ll reach more people than Larry King
Live used to or most of the CNN
talk-show hosts get so luckily we&#39;re
able to bypass it now but back in the
good old days but even then it sort of
relegated a mainstream the thing that
people respect for their source of news
CBS News ABC News CNN etc and so on
won&#39;t touch this in a credible way and
if they start to and believe me there
have been many initiatives from The Wall
Street Journal approached me wanting to
do a huge story gets killed gets killed
gets killed so there are operatives that
are embedded in the corporate that
integrated corporations of all of these
media holding companies and it will not
make it out and that has been my
experience to date I&#39;d love to be
surprised
now that then brings in the question of
what about the rest of the sector&#39;s hang
you know and someone at the the break
brought up this question of funding
because I mentioned towards the end well
there&#39;s eight and a half trillion now
that&#39;s unaccounted for trillion not
billion trillion a trillion is a
thousand billion so in other words it a
lot of money and unfortunately it isn&#39;t
as obvious as it seems and this is where
you know take the children out of the
room
here&#39;s how this actually works so you
have I mentioned the sort of storefront
with the military-industrial
unacknowledged special access project
and that&#39;s you can kind of steal
actually several billion dollars very
easily that way
and each year is the maid out of the
Treasury of the United States through
these operations as between 100 and 200
trillion dollar billion dollars not you
know a huge amount but if you look at
the military intelligence Homeland
Security FBI and there are other people
there was a undersecretary for HUD for
her Bush George HW Bush who discovered
that HUD money Housing and Urban
Development money was being secuence
if--and off into these black projects
and she started to blow the whistle on
it she got fired so one of the things
you have to begin to get your mind
around is how the the unacknowledged
special access projects can penetrate
not just the intelligence and military
but other agencies and then siphon off
funds and it you know you get a trickle
here and trickling becomes this huge
river
now there&#39;s another second and very
important way that funding happens and
that is through monetizing products now
what I mean by that let&#39;s say that your
Bell Labs back in the old days or some
of these other large corporations and
you&#39;re studying under us funding
contracts in these unacknowledged
projects a technology and you figure out
oh this is really what you can do with
an integrated circuit and miniaturize it
or this is what you can this these
things we collected off the desert for
and 47 where these little fibrous things
and you put a light at one end boom is
perfectly transmitted to the other fiber
optics so you then create a market for
it and and you allow some of this out
but there&#39;s a huge amount of money made
on productizing fiber optics integrated
circuits miniaturization micro
processors things of this sort so there
are spin-offs and those spin-offs make
an enormous amount of money for those
companies even though we the taxpayers
paid for the R&amp;D and those folks really
didn&#39;t invent it
but they benefit from it from the
corporate level so that enriches the
corporation so that it can then self
fund through licensing and product
ization things that were actually funded
by the taxpayer now big farm the
pharmaceutical industry does this all
the time they take stuff that&#39;s being
funded at NIH or through university
grants the breakthroughs happen in basic
science they then take it one step
further patent it license it and next
thing you know of course the
chemotherapy cost you two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars that&#39;s how it
works
like rituximab so but that that&#39;s been
done with these high-tech programs since
the 5th 40s and 50s so that&#39;s a huge
source so then they have their own
funding right now you can see how they
can lift off the reservation away from
government even more because they&#39;re
more independent corporate then there&#39;s
the banking sector and this is the big
one you know the Federal Reserve Board
basically just invents money out of thin
air or when we had the financial crisis
four years ago in the mainstream Wall
Street Journal you know it was admitted
they basically injected 17 trillion
dollars into the banking sector trillion
tarp was a small part of says 800
billion not much this is 17 trillion
basically at no interest gave 17
trillion dollars to the gang banksters I
call them they are gang banksters and
those guys who have integrated if you
look at the corporate nexus between the
banking and financial sector and these
large corporations and these government
agency there is a nexus that gets woven
and the real power is really in the
financial macroeconomic level and they
basically can fund whatever and whoever
they want and can move money around
virtually with impunity they&#39;re too big
to fail at this point they&#39;re I mean
there&#39;s a joke that if you think they&#39;re
right being regulated this is a joke so
the gang banksters have learned how to
use that system and they have
investments and interests and in
startups you know whether it&#39;s the
Blackstone Group or the Carlyle Group
and this you know private banking at
JPMorgan Chase and with this and that
the other thing and so there&#39;s this
whole labyrinthine system that involves
the banking sector and then there are
covert parts of the banking sector I&#39;ll
tell you a story of a man who back when
I was working on this and they&#39;d made
another run after I said no to the head
of Army Intelligence when they wanted to
buy my silence with two billion dollars
and slush fund money I was taken to the
Wrigley mansion in Phoenix one night it
was a late night meeting maybe 10 11
o&#39;clock and there was a whole group of
people is a like a conference for
boardroom in this mansion and around the
table were a whole bunch of suits and
most of them were corporate couple
government and they say basically to me
you know they said you don&#39;t need to
bother with someone like the President
or the CIA director they don&#39;t know
anything and they&#39;re not going to know
anything you need to be meeting with
people like well us who do fwf Oh work
for other programs for the government
and there are certain orders of Jesuit
priests who are involved with technology
transfer policy I said what I thought
that got date they were on drugs and
turned out every word they said was true
and I was listening be an interesting
movie wasn&#39;t it anyone has cojones to do
it then they started just one guy pulled
me aside and he said you know we&#39;ve
checked you out your doctor you have
good credit good income take out as many
platinum cards as you want give them to
me we will then zero out the account
balances every month so you can spend
several million dollars a month and
we&#39;ll just zero it out now you put me
under sodium pentothal II happened and I
said well then you would own me what
you Jim he says oh don&#39;t look at it that
way we&#39;re here trying to help you
I said no he would own me this is fraud
banking fraud and he says no well you
know just look at it as a friendly hand
helping you out I mean it&#39;s friendly
yeah devil was forked tongue and and
then he started to explain he says you
know there are a lot of creative ways
where we can get money when we need to
in it this guy headed up some folks who
do the backup computers for the banking
system and these are big supercomputers
and basically when you have trillions of
dollars daily going back and forth and
currency exchange and transactions
there&#39;s an odd amount left over that&#39;s
less than a penny or less than of euro
or less than a yen that gets dropped
into a black fund account and it&#39;s a lot
of money it adds up on a daily if you
take 365 days in a year you&#39;ve got a lot
of money from that it becomes billions
tens of billions so you have the black
budget unacknowledged projects you have
the corruption and fraud it within the
government system you have the product
ization monetization of things that
we&#39;re paying for the study that they
then monetize like integrated circuits
and cell phones and fiber optics then
you have the banking corruption and then
you have the PS the resistance and the
one that is the most disturbing and
that&#39;s drug trade so the worldwide drug
trade cash cash and carry bigger than
oil and when I first heard this from an
attorney who was representing a man&#39;s
family whose husband marine colonel was
murdered because he saw them offloading
drugs at a military base in California I
thought this was a bridge too far I did
not actually believe it
and this attorney a very very credible
guy Harvard law it was representing the
family to get them to exhume the body
because the body was the death was
deemed a suicide and the family knew the
man had been murdered because of what he
saw cuz he had told one family member
what he saw and he was at the wrong
place at the wrong time in a restricted
landing area and a restricted facility
where one of our aircraft was offloading
a large amount of drugs that would then
be sent out through various drug cartels
and whatnot and they killed him because
of what he saw made it look like an
suicide and I filed that away his data
point one then I had another data point
come in of a woman who owned a 5,000
acre sheep ranch in South Dakota all
places but adjacent to it was what had
been a chemical weapons storage area and
an underground facility and she had
enough resources that she had her own
people go out with night scopes and
found that there were ARV so-called
alien reproduction via these man-made
antigravity things going in and out of
this facility wee hours of the morning
and then she got someone close enough we
saw that they were offloading huge
amounts of chemical weapons armaments
and drugs so arms shipping as well as
drug shipping she contacted senator
Daschle the senior senator of South
Dakota who started digging into it he
got threatened personally I have a whole
dossier file on this in my vault and he
backed off of it he ran from it
lightyear he had the speed of light to
get away from it because they made it
very clear stay away from this senator
Daschle he said I can&#39;t help you anymore
so she reached out to me saying can you
help me but was part of what was
happening is that some of these chemical
weapons that were stored there were
leaking into not only the the
groundwater but and where her sheep and
a lot of them are dying and it was like
these containers that were corroding is
like a Superfund site that classified
the disaster and that&#39;s why she was so
kind
 and she had hope I mean 5,000
acres and I said look you know I&#39;m I&#39;ll
make some calls and see what I can do
but I&#39;m you know I&#39;ve got a heavy lift
here I&#39;m doing on my own besides your
sheep but but this is a very real case
then on the day after I met with and
briefed the head of intelligence for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff
I got a cryptic invitation from two men
my wife and I called him mr. Allen one
and mr. Allen - so not their name that
was our code name I I won&#39;t want to talk
about who they actually aren&#39;t older
deceased i confirmed they&#39;re deceased
and they invited me over to this condo
in Crystal City near nationally report
which turned out was the home of a
former congressman who was sort of a
consigliere and sort of advisor to
George HW Bush and in the room with him
was a burly man who was a science
applications international corporation
executive who was living virtually in
retirement exile in France who had come
in for the meeting and it it was
shocking
what I learned but in not so shocking
given what I&#39;ve just told you but they
said do you understand how dangerous
this group is I said yes I do personally
and they said but do you understand what
they&#39;re really doing they&#39;re destroying
our world they&#39;re destroying our planet
and they&#39;re destroying our country and
these are the ones that have gotten off
the reservation even from George HW Bush
and I&#39;ve escaped control gangland-style
I said yeah I know that there are
special compartmented operations that
are unacknowledged that aren&#39;t even
under the control of magic anymore Maj I
see they said yes there&#39;s a big one and
it deals with drugs he says there is an
army of 8,000 men that are special
operations folks and he&#39;s they said that
they do they move drugs all over the
world
and the country and we have killed 2,000
of them murdered them thrown them out of
helicopters missing in action because of
minor infractions and security or a hint
that there might be two of the eight
thousand of the eight thousand and they
begin to describe this program in detail
and I listened and they said you know so
this is part of the problem you&#39;re
dealing with and by the way to connect
the dots this is why we don&#39;t have
legalization or decriminalization of
drugs which every health policy person
knows you can buy anything on the
streets of any little town in America it
needs to be controlled you know I mean
it needs to be something where there&#39;s
treatment education what-have-you but if
it was made legal you would take away an
enormous part of the funding for this
criminal cartel and it is the biggest
criminal enterprise in the world so one
of my attorney said you know what you&#39;re
really describing is a transnational
Rico racketeering influenced corrupt
organization I said yes of course
he says well you know the civilians can
mount outside of the government a
proceeding against using the RICO
statutes that basically which was set up
for the Mafia I said yeah if you know an
attorney that has the courage to do it
let me know and this gets into something
else that could be done and with the
information that we have and the people
that could be asked about and that is a
major investigation with a whistleblower
Act result what do I mean by that the
federal whistleblower Act allows for
someone to blow the whistle on illegal
and corrupt activity and what is
recovered or exposed to that
whistleblower the whistleblower gets a
percentage of in this case we&#39;d be
talking about billions of dollars so if
there&#39;s a legal team that wants to head
this up
and some more whistleblowers that we can
put together that&#39;s how you could fund
the Energy Lab but it would be a very
big lawsuit and project it can be done
if there&#39;s anyone who has the
wherewithal to do it I&#39;ve mentioned this
to a few attorneys and then when they
find out who you&#39;re really taking on
they go no thanks no thanks no thing so
it&#39;s all about courage you have the
courage to take on this sort of Fourth
Reich that&#39;s really running this project
this this neo-fascist trans national
security state but that is another big
part of the funding mechanism and there
are others but these are the big pillars
of how you get funding for an
unacknowledged special access project it
isn&#39;t nice and it isn&#39;t pretty and then
it ends up doing things that are
completely out of the control if we go
to the next document from Prince
hans-adam von Lichtenstein this is going
to get heavier and darker for a little
bit until it gets better it&#39;s bare with
me and you know I don&#39;t know if you know
who this is a blip in Stein is a big
banking empire and kind of they funded a
lot of Adolf Hitler&#39;s work and the crown
prince is their king so this is a man
that I&#39;ve met with and known for a
number of years I think this is dated
1994 and hans-adam von Lichtenstein
the first time I called that I was asked
to call the castle his butler or someone
picked up and then he was Amelie put on
and we talked and he says well I don&#39;t
want to talk on the phone too much but
we should meet and these letters this
and that you can go to the next one also
it was a maybe a few a month later or
something was from the castle of I Do&#39;s
and this is the actual letters he&#39;s and
he basically said to me you know let&#39;s
get together and I think he was wanting
me to come to Europe and I say well I&#39;m
too busy I&#39;m working as a doctor and
and then it ended up and although it&#39;s
not reflected in this letter he came to
New York and stayed at the Four Seasons
Hotel there on Central Park and so he
invited me over and I had a meeting with
him but he says from what I know of your
assessment your assessment is correct
about the group this cabal which is
controlling the issue we discussed UFO I
suspect they have very good reasons not
to inform the public and therefore I am
highly skeptical about your chances of
success but he still wanted to meet so I
said okay let&#39;s meet so this is where
it&#39;s going to get into some shock and
awe I&#39;ve done 94 in July I go up and
meet with him at the Pierre hotel for
seasons and the reason he didn&#39;t think
it could succeed is that he told me the
ETS wouldn&#39;t allow it he wouldn&#39;t allow
they wouldn&#39;t allow disclosure to happen
I said excuse me we&#39;re making contact
and it&#39;s clear that you know he said
well let me tell you what happened so he
was involved with a lot of UN programs
and also with George HW Bush the first
president Bush and a man at the UN named
Paris de Cuellar who was the Secretary
General at the time I had done briefings
with the predecessor the were the one
after of Boutros boutros-ghali and he
said to me the reason I on the phone
told you that it wouldn&#39;t be allowed
isn&#39;t that it wouldn&#39;t be allowed from
the point of view of the government but
the aliens won&#39;t allow it I saw that&#39;s
ridiculous I mean since we&#39;ve been
talking we&#39;ve gone down to Mexico had
craft come out I say they&#39;re obviously
wanting to make contact if we do it in a
peaceful way in on a military way he
says well this was attempted before you
started your organization I said what
are you talking about
he says well in November of 1989 in the
fall of 1989 President Ronald Reagan
Mikhail Gorbachev Paris de cuéllar and
himself this guy
and others met with on a committee very
sensitive and classified to organize
basically what I did with the disclosure
project to announce that we weren&#39;t
alone and in the secrecy and he said
what happened is that Paris de cuéllar
the Secretary General of the United
Nations was coming back from a three am
late nine plan enforces abducted by
aliens from his motorcade in Manhattan
and I said oh really and he proceeded to
tell me glory details of what happened
so Paris de Cuellar was taken somehow
out of the motorcade onto an ET craft
where he was threatened by the ETS and
told if you disclose this information we
will abduct every world leader involved
including the President of the United
States now this is from a person who was
at the table for this planning session
to my ears now to you and I went oh come
on really and he said yeah blew up like
an atomic bomb in the Bush White House
subsequently I found out that if it
Kennebunkport there were all these UFOs
zipping around when Bush was up there
out on a cigarette boat and they didn&#39;t
realize they were ours so now we&#39;re
getting into false flag 101 up to and
including be able to deceive members of
magic and it took me a long time to get
to the bottom of this mystery now people
like Budd Hopkins thought it was a real
abduction case and I looked into it and
I found out that if you go back to the
Roswell event there was a redheaded
sergeant who is the badass guy who
threatened to kill everyone all those
ranchers who saw this thing crash his
son became a part of magic security this
renegade group this splinter group who
was involved with abductions and
stopping leaks within magic itself
they even when
and was in the security detail that
night and set up the electronics for
this electronic warfare abduction of
aliens it was all a hoax was an et at
all it was 100% military ops and so when
we&#39;re gonna get into this in a moment
well how these operate and so Paris de
cuéllar course not knowing about that
end of the classified world and I would
say Papa Bush neither thought it was
actually et and it blew up as I said
like an atomic bomb in the Bush White
House and Gorbachev they pulled the plug
on the plans to do disclosure and in
secrecy in 1989 at the end of the Cold
War and I think it&#39;s strange that in
January of 92 months later it&#39;s when I
had a contact event at my house in North
Carolina with an et and with the that
said basically pick up what you&#39;ve
dropped do this what you what you&#39;ve
left and behind as a teenager pick this
up again someone&#39;s got to pick this up
but maybe that&#39;s a coincidence but
Harris de Cuellar thought that that was
an actual alien abduction and I had that
I said well with your highness with all
due respect there are technologies that
would facilitate this kind of deception
and the military term so you know it is
a false inw or a deceptive iw indication
and warning and it&#39;s basically like the
you know Gulf of Tonkin event in Vietnam
you basically exaggerate a hoax an event
that then manipulates policymakers so
this was the ultimate takedown of
official disclosure which was about to
happen in 1989 got it 26 years ago
November 1989 so here we are in 2015 and
it took a lot to piece all this together
and I began to look into what the
electronics war
with this and all what kind of
technologies they might have and one bit
of insight that print the prints had he
said you know so he told me that the
reason he was funding the abduction
groups is that he was convinced that
there was an existential threat from
outer space that&#39;s been the Sabrosa plan
since the fifty-six and that he wanted
people to hate the aliens enough to pay
the blood and treasure of World War
three and he also wanted it to be
eschatological where it would result in
the end of the world so that Christ
would return and the good folks would go
up in a flying saucer I guess with
Christ now this is what he was telling
me I&#39;m just listening and I&#39;m going whoa
this is like woohoo and he was
completely convinced that this is what
needed to happen this sort of end of the
world
eschatological eschatology is the study
of the end of the world then and that&#39;s
why he was putting so much money and
providing so much funding to Mack and
David Jacobs and you know but Hopkins
and all this and he eventually he told
me he says I&#39;m gonna stop funding John
Mack because he&#39;s become too positive
about contact and I only want to fund
people who are going to put things out
there that scare people and make them
hate the aliens he said this so I went
oh boy now this and that this is
connecting a dot that all of you better
listen to very carefully if it&#39;s the
last thing you learn today and that is
that there is an overarching agenda that
was hatched in the 50s this murmur that
psychological warfare document and its
value that was hashed in 50 between 53
and 56 to create the spectre of a threat
from outer space that does not exist
Verner von Braun stated on his deathbed
and we have the testimony of his
assistant that will and and said they
will first have the Cold War then we
decided there would be nations of
concern
then global terrorism we have this
testimony from before 9/11 then that
would be followed by threats from outer
space they&#39;ll start talking about
asteroids and things of this sort but
the ultimate one they&#39;re going to play
is the alien threat and it&#39;s all a lie
and it&#39;s all a hoax but in order for the
lie to work they have had to create a
body of disinformation false information
and frightening scenarios and actual
events that would be convincing to our
policymakers like Reagan convincing to
the average person and to the UFO public
that consumes videos entertainment
consoles movies etc and that has been
thus 50 to 60 year plan don&#39;t forget
that no less a figure than Douglas
MacArthur in his last address to the
Congress said World War 3 will be
interplanetary so they have been wanting
to provoke an interplanetary conflict
for as long as I&#39;ve been alive and I&#39;m
no spring chicken
and all right so this gets into a huge
problem of how people consume
information and can be manipulated
through fear because if you look at the
roots of human warfare the early days
and even today it&#39;s people abducting
people tribes women raping them abusing
them sexually etc and so on this is all
stuff that they are simulating and
saying that the ETS are doing through
these abduction scenarios it is 100
percent being done by military special
operations that are this paramilitary
force and this is the deep end of the
pond now when I discovered this back in
1994 now this is 21 years on I was told
by some an intelligence community don&#39;t
talk about that because that&#39;s what&#39;s
really dangerous for you and it&#39;s also
what will discredit you and it also
calls them to heat
most because your defanging their whole
war plan the next big war is not
terrorism its interstellar and if you
expose that it&#39;s a hoax it takes all the
steam out of their plan I said yes but
if we don&#39;t we&#39;re cooked
because there&#39;s no way you can have war
that&#39;s interstellar and survive it
it&#39;d be worse than mutual assured
destruction because the technologies are
thousand times worse than a hydrogen
bomb so I said look we&#39;re gonna have to
figure out how to deal with this and the
only way I know how to do it is put the
sunlight in there and let people know
what the truth is so a man came along if
you go to the next slide and you
probably have feigned this it&#39;s up on
our website when we first put it up it
had over 600,000 views the next day the
intelligence community went in and said
there are six thousand views by the way
if you believe the metrics on Google and
YouTube I have a bridge to sell you
it&#39;s it&#39;s all can be manipulated because
it moves you down the search engines so
when this hit within a couple days had
six hundred thousand views this man
William is that it&#39;s pronounced
 was a man very good man who gave
me an interview only to be released
posthumously after he died and not long
a few years ago I got a letter from his
wife significant other I guess they
weren&#39;t technically married with a death
certificate and a letter giving me
permission and he had passed them he&#39;d
passed away and I have a lot of these
you know and I honor my word about
keeping a confidence so what happened is
that he gave me this interview and in it
he talks about the development of RF
radio frequency chip implants back in
the 70s and 80s and when he was
developed it was totally an accidental
thing that happy was with a company had
developed it he then got called in to
the CIA
and they started doing special programs
with the CIA to develop it at a certain
point Siemens in Silicon Valley
manufactured two billion of them with a
B of these RF chips and the way they
were I mean they can be so miniaturised
you could eat something with it it has a
radio free and it can transmit only
where you are but the really advanced
ones have a neuro phone capability to
control thought behavior very sinister
stuff so you can actually do a lot of
psychological warfare with these RF
frequency chips now that was the early
stages in the 70s and 80s now you figure
you know forty years later they&#39;re more
and more and more and more sophisticated
and as I&#39;ve watched the whole UFO
subculture sort of get involved with
this whole fascination with abductions
and an implant I went yeah but you know
EG&amp;G
is only one of the plants is on the edge
of the area 51 they&#39;re the ones
manufacturing the implants that you&#39;re
taking out of these abduction victims
absolutely they&#39;re not coming from outer
space they don&#39;t need that if you&#39;re
interstellar you&#39;re transdimensional if
you&#39;re transdimensional you don&#39;t need
an RF frequency plant chip to track
anybody because their technologies are
way beyond that
I said this is human 100% and you better
wake up and so pal that gave us this
interview and it was one of a dozen data
points that I began to accumulate and
then not many years ago I get a document
the next one which is chilling has never
been shown it&#39;s from the Strategic
Studies Institute think-tank and it&#39;s
dated 1995 and it was talking about all
kinds of global security strategies and
you know you can look at it yourself
cult program graduates blah blah blah
who will be expected to participate in
contrived UFO
and scenarios listen carefully oh we
need the next one up Strategic Studies
Institute is it I can&#39;t see the screen
is it up all right so I loathe wreathing
to people because but this I will and
number two create a global UFO cult
which will involve this this is what
needs to be done in order to actuate
this false flag operation that will
involve the abduction of citizens so as
to foster an illusion that this earth is
facing an extraterrestrial invasion UFO
abductees of preference will have an
experience in computer technologies
since that expertise will be required in
future technocratic RMA scenarios use of
experimental drugs holographic
projection capabilities directed energy
technologies I&#39;ll get into that in a
moment
induced auditory input these are the
neuro phones I mentioned that Verner von
braun said the most dangerous thing is
the neuro phone non-local things that
can be done to make people think they&#39;re
having an experience when they&#39;re not
input experimental aircraft well that&#39;s
just a euphemism for manmade UFOs and
special effects costuming and stage
craft among other things will be used to
persuade the abductees of the reality of
their circumstances official denials
regarding these events will employ
reverse psychology to ensure that all
such denials are taken as official
confirmation of an imminent and or
ongoing extraterrestrial invasion this
is the next page UFO abductees will be
persuaded to worship their anticipated
et conquerors in cult enforced religious
fashion UFO cult networks will be
controlled by US intelligence to limit
infiltration and ensure that dissidents
do not disrupt UFO long-term
cult long-term agendas uncontrollable
dissidents will be assassinated
preferably by directed-energy means
dissociative satanic cult graduates will
handle all such executions ie when not
actively lending logical and theatrical
support to UFO abduction operations
number three directed-energy
surveillance and weapons technology of
all types and caps will be used for
purposes of spreading fear and confusion
in the population at large under
deniable circumstances for eliminating
persons deemed adversarial to US
national security interest and for
spotting assessing and manipulating
potential recruits to the RMA crow caws
Neurosci burn etics and other psycho
technologies will be used as sap so
confusion and hypochondria in the
population the symptoms and effects
produced by these and other directed
energy technologies will parallel the
effects produced by various microbes
viruses and chemical imbalances thus
compelling a large segment slightest
seek medical intervention which in turn
will be a basis for their being used for
medical experimentation under voluntary
circumstances psychiatrists and
psychologists will play an important
role in these experiments particularly
we&#39;re denying the efficacy of neuro
cybernetics psycho technologies is
concerned citizens who complain of
hearing voices will be used as a basis
for generously government-funded
schizophrenic related brain research on
and on and on it goes on now if you&#39;re
not falling out of your chair yet what I
want to tell you is that all of that has
come to pass and came to pass between
the 1950s and the 1970s a man that I
worked with before his death had
developed an electronic system in 1956
or 5454 that would enable someone
electronically to Remote View anywhere
and could also affect some of these have
been called radionics psycho
weapon systems and they were developed
decades ago now how hard is it to deploy
them not hard and they&#39;re not used every
day they&#39;re used enough to create a
groundswell of conviction that there&#39;s
an alien threat so you take that
capability combine it with manmade UFOs
combine it with this information in
general about the subject and also
certain chemicals and you can launch an
entire contagion of fear that&#39;s based on
a completely man-made false events so
this is the false flag event I wanted to
warn you about it and people say when is
that going to happen I said it&#39;s
happened already it&#39;s already happened
the media the film industry any UFO
conference you go to is going to be
filled unwittingly usually not always
unwittingly but usually with information
that is this kind of disinformation
designed to create an us-versus-them
dynamic of an alien threat and the
reason for it is that that is the only
way to grow the military-industrial
complex
you know Leon Panetta the CIA director
and then Secretary of Defense but when
he was CIA director said you know we&#39;re
spending a hundred and ten billion
dollars a year chasing down 70 al-qaeda
members in Afghanistan ridiculous and in
order to sustain the level of
expenditures and grow the military
industrial intelligence laboratory
financial complex you got to have
another enemy and as terrible as the
terrorism threat is and it&#39;s real it&#39;s
nothing compared to what they could do
like in the movie Independence Day where
they staged an attack using man-made
anti grabs that look very et with this
kind of technology that there is a
threat or an attack on earth so heads up
Verner von braun on his deathbed warned
this would happen and it would be hoaxed
we&#39;ve had so many people I have met with
one man I can&#39;t get him to come forward
and then another and then another and
then another who spoke of in the early
days they used I know this sounds
terrible but he was a little guy and it
was a little he was so short and they
basically did like you would in a movie
suit and head and meant to make him look
like an alien and he would be there
would be military choppers nearby but he
would be on one of these flying discs
man-made and go in and with a chemical
canister and some electronics abduct
people he says oh yeah I was on an
abduction squad it was way back I think
in the 60s they&#39;ve gotten better and I
say better and they they become more
efficient because over the decades
they&#39;ve developed little creatures that
look like an et they may look gray or
like a reptile or this and they actually
they kind of walk like this they have
this robotic weird walk and if you look
at the I saw the video that stay in Rome
and that CAD of the one that came into
his house that that basically a film
company bought up in Black shelf nobody
has seen this I was at his home and the
one that came into his house was exactly
one of these so-called gray like
creatures and the way it moved was this
very robotic is so obvious that it was a
bio machine and if you go into the brain
it is physical it has a biological
component but the it&#39;s laced the neural
cortex is laced with integrated circuits
it&#39;s completely under control these
military operatives but he thought it
was an alien I said well it was an alien
but not an et so I used the word alien
which is has a very xenophobic ring to
connote the man made once and the ETS
are the ones that are interstellar the
aliens that are man-made are ones that
are completely under the control of
these paramilitary operations and the
stagecraft if you use the language of
this Strategic Studies Institute
document is
good that it would fool anyone the
president the CI you could abduct and
they did they abducted Paris de cuéllar
out of his limousine using this stuff
and he thought it was et and that&#39;s why
they killed the initial plan to end
secrecy at the end of the Cold War
Gorbachev was on board
Reagan was on board prepares to clay our
head of the UN Prince of Liechtenstein
was involved etc and so on killed him
now now we&#39;re getting that did this I
know is where everyone&#39;s going and this
man have lost his mind every word I&#39;m
telling you is true this is the heart of
the secrecy how do you convince people
there&#39;s another species to hate now they
actually took this from the PlayBook of
Adolf Hitler the way they conditioned
the popular how did you get how you get
a very I mean in the 20s in the early
part of the 20th century Germany was the
apex of culture a tradition
progressivity intellectual pursuits etc
and so on how do you get that population
to devolve into this horrific community
that could engage in the Holocaust and
World War two the way that happened
psychological warfare so the
psychological warfare masters that were
involved with the German attempt at
Nazism got pulled into the OSS fence
that became the CIA and they reside
today within this unacknowledged
transnational deep national security
state so that&#39;s exactly the problem
we&#39;re facing it isn&#39;t pretty yeah I&#39;ve
tried to summarize it in these three or
four hours as best as I can but it&#39;s the
truth
now as Gloria Steinem said the truth
will set you free but first it might
piss you off
and I think you know a lot of people
when they learn that this is what
they&#39;ve been involved with people who&#39;ve
done research on this subject get quite
irritated because they begin to realize
that almost everything you know about
the subject is not true
about why they&#39;re here
now what I&#39;ve learned is being head of
the ce-5 global ce-5 effort let&#39;s go to
the next one it&#39;s a very interesting
thing that came out not long ago
it&#39;s from the Daily Mail in the UK but
it was an article about this this new
electronic warfare system then I
actually talked about this 20-some years
ago but they&#39;re just now bringing it out
and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s the kind of
almost like Star Trek but it&#39;s a
something you can put up that basically
knocks out all electronic communication
oh the next you have the next one and
it&#39;s a it just gives you the idea that
if this is being reported in the regular
media or even tabloid media this is at
least 30 to 40 years old this and it&#39;s
basically a platform that can float over
an area and knock out all electronics
not only in a city but over a
battlefield or what have you
using pulsed microwaves now this is not
talking about scaler this is pulsed
microwaves but when you pulse microwaves
in a certain way it can cross over into
this longitudinal effect and it can have
an enormous lee destructive result and
this was actually getting reported so if
this is being acknowledged in the media
it means that it&#39;s at least five six
seven generations old so in other words
this is not state-of-the-art anything
that&#39;s acknowledged in the mainstream
media is going to be old old old
technology and and the really
state-of-the-art stuff is highly
classified compartmented and
unacknowledged most of the really
amazing stuff so this brings us to how
do we get out of this conundrum and if
used to the next put up the next one I
just want to share this I share this in
my London presentation last my are in
September and this is the French
initiative
and you see the date on it this is by
far who we&#39;re about to release all of
this with a report on the internet
document ever generated by a government
on this subject
urgent 16 January 2007 the French
government had decided to reach out to
us to make peaceful contact with the ETS
and bypassed this entire unacknowledged
world of cloak-and-dagger nonsense and
so through a series of meetings that
happened over three or four years the
this dr. Moran and his people a very
senior guy of Admiral and PhD scientists
also a medical doctor with the Ministry
of Defense this is an official Ministry
of Defense letter to me and a few other
people about this project and what they
wanted to do was to have the protocols
established and with this document came
an entire separate attachment that had
all the research and equipment that
would be needed to do a friendly
diplomatic contact with these
civilizations in France and so we
cooperated with that this was something
that was not talked about until
September and I referred to it some
years ago those of you may remember I
talked about a major g7 country whose
Ministry of Defence was reaching out to
us to make peaceful contact this is it
you know I&#39;m speaking of it now cause
that government left as Sarkozy the
president Sarkozy and enough time has
passed that I feel like I can talk about
it with without too many ruffled
feathers there&#39;s still going to be
ruffled feathers with this but
importantly what you have to look at
with this document and it&#39;s basically an
explanation if you look at the
translation we had expected to do an
event sooner and it kept getting delayed
and the delay was because of issus as
politics and there were people
interfering with this attempt to go
and have a team of folks with the air
support security support and have like
in Close Encounters of the Third Kind a
contact a landing or a near contact
event under the official auspices of the
Ministry of Defense of France now when
we started going back and forth with
this communication of course everything
I do is monitored in real time the
French ambassador to the United States
got a very nasty phone call from our
intelligence community and saying what
the hell do you think you&#39;re doing and
they really cussed him out and he said
look we&#39;re doing this over a sovereign
country and basically what was said back
to him was don&#39;t do it anywhere near us
assets or US airspace or Urist territory
or you&#39;ll be in big trouble and the
French got very irritated by this that
will be completely within France and
it&#39;s none of your business so obviously
there are elements within magic in
France who have run interference to
interfere with this process every major
country have elements and so it&#39;s very
political it becomes very very thorny
but the very fact that senior people in
the Ministry of Defence of a major g7
country group of seven major economic
country would and a nuclear power would
reach out to make peaceful contact using
the close encounters of the fifth kind
of Nishat &#39;iv is by far the most
historic thing and that&#39;s why this
document I think it&#39;s most important
document ever written because it&#39;s not
classified I only kept it private
because I didn&#39;t want to burn bridges to
the government that was there and it did
involve all the way up to the President
of France this effort we actually ended
up going I believe it was in 2010 or
2011 and did a ce-5 event that actually
had enormous results and their military
had cordoned off the airspace directed
and we had a 2,200 acre estate in
Brittany and there were 80 craft tract
going over head at over 200,000
kilometres an hour and all kinds of
strange
phenomenon in the field where we were
which the Admiral was there and now no
one knew that&#39;s who he was this ended up
being a demonstration event for the
Ministry of Defense people and not it
was directed by me and the cover story
was that it was a sea SETI expedition
for a weekend so safety sometimes come
on these expeditions there may be other
folks there huh get it nobody knew who
he was he was just a nice gentleman in a
plaid shirt but that&#39;s how these things
have to happen I mean it wasn&#39;t my place
to expose who he was but they were very
happy with the results and have learned
a lot and we&#39;re continuing to teach them
about the concepts of nonlocality and
consciousness remote viewing coherent
thoughts sequencing electronic interface
with thought that the ETS have how to
set up the correct philosophy and
conditions for contact on and on and on
and this is really the core of course
why I founded this organization was to
move us away from the brink of war into
a time of interplanetary peace and
universal peace but at the same time we
have to understand that an operation
like this isn&#39;t going on in a vacuum in
outer space it&#39;s going on within a world
that&#39;s enormous ly dysfunctional
particularly with these national
security issues and these sort of spy
versus spy groups who interfere and
there was enormous interference between
2007 and 2010 trying to stop that
process and it continues to go on I mean
there it turns out there are people who
are key involved with the laya zone who
were actually moles from magic who are
there to disrupt events infiltrators so
this is what happens I mean this is
welcome to my life but and that should
be of no surprise to anyone I know
certainly no surprise to me but
ultimately the fact that there would be
a major initiative like this from a
government like France for peaceful
purposes as a
to a warfare our militaristic purposes
is a very positive development because I
had a lucid dream years ago before I
started these projects and I tend to I&#39;m
part Cherokee and I have a lot of lucid
dreams of the future met my wife that
way and we were in the future
and we were at White Sands where the
first atomic bomb went off and there was
a beautiful event happening and the US
Air Force in government had moved off
this dime of either denial or
suppression or hoaxing and trying to
create this false flag World War three
conflict that&#39;s completely a hoax and
had decided yes we need to pick this
other path and make peaceful contact and
a massive government sanctioned ce-5 was
happening broad daylight and this
beautiful silver seamless object
descended in a bed of a blue sky landed
and an ancient elder ET came out of it
and this was all broadcast live the
whole world saw it now you know maybe
that was before I found it C SETI in the
disclosure project and all this and and
I was maybe in my early 20s when I had
that dream and I&#39;m 60 now so you know
it&#39;s it&#39;s a potential future but I do
believe as a potential future and the
way it&#39;s going to become a real future
is for all of us to do that because
guess what you know who the leaders are
on this you guys not the president not
the Congress disclosure contact all of
that first has to be the people we the
people it&#39;s gonna happen by us banding
together making contact being
enlightened about what we&#39;re doing not
going out there with ray guns but doing
it for the purpose of an open
relationship that&#39;s peaceful and
enduring between our planet and these
other planets that is the only possible
outcome anyway the other outcome any
conflict I don&#39;t care with any et
civilization would be the complete
destruction of their planet and
hours it would be much worse than a
massive global thermonuclear war
exchange so there is no possible future
except a peaceful one so let&#39;s figure
out how to do that no matter what your
belief systems about these various
civilizations that are out there my own
assessment is that some are not really
thrilled with us because well who
wouldn&#39;t be
and some are maybe our distant cousins
and some are just getting involved in
looking with some horror at what&#39;s
happening but ultimately none of them
are overtly hostile if they were it&#39;d be
over let me tell you it would have been
over the when we dropped the first
atomic bomb and I&#39;ve been told that by
multiple members of magic maj I see
because they have said yeah of course I
mean any but it&#39;s very easy to play on
people&#39;s paranoia&#39;s and fears through
mutilations and abductions and this dr.
John Altschuler I mentioned who is the
nephew of Jimmy Doolittle general
Doolittle he became the guy who did the
first snippy the horse case you know
snippy the horse the macadam cattle
mutilation and animal mutilation case
that was him he would didn&#39;t get
acknowledged because he won to stay in
the background he was the scientist he I
was staying at his home outside Denver
he said absolutely that case was
military made to look et for the purpose
of scouting the hell out of people I
said really he says absolutely and then
I met with a man it was an accidental
you know the universe works in strange
ways I&#39;m sitting on a flight flying I
think from Colorado or New Mexico to the
east coast and I&#39;m the guy sitting
beside me says oh hi so I&#39;m a doctor and
so what are you doing out here
I said well I wouldn&#39;t actually do stuff
with UFOs he says oh you&#39;re kidding he
says let me tell you and he owned a
250,000 acre ranch in northern New
Mexico and he said let me tell you what
they&#39;re doing to my cattle and he and he
said but it is not alien it&#39;s humans and
he was he had night scopes he put me
with a very wealthy man and he said
these guys are coming in there with
special silent helicopters and
have them my military adviser was on a
ship where one landed in a fog and they
were they couldn&#39;t see it they said
where is it where is it
they said it&#39;s look up it&#39;s right above
you and there&#39;s no sound completely
quiet he says and we caught them
red-handed doing these mutilations on my
cattle and I and he instituted a lawsuit
against the US government but the group
doing it was an unacknowledged group
that extra-constitutional in the US
government said we don&#39;t know anything
about it and the government people they
who said that we&#39;re telling them the
truth see this is real plausible
deniability right because they can
honestly say we don&#39;t know anything
about this so he took it all the way
through the federal court system he just
got thrown out even though he had
dispositive evidence human paramilitary
in US military assets were doing it and
you know I chaired this hole in the
movement Howell and others into an alien
harvest I said alien baloney this is
being done by people who want to scare
the hell out of the public as part of
this psychological warfare that was
launched in 1953 but there&#39;s another
reason for it they&#39;re getting raw
materials that they do for take from
that it&#39;s hard to do it underground take
them to underground bases which become
Culture Media for their program life
forms the man-made ETS I&#39;m talking about
we don&#39;t have time to go into what these
nano technological things are but let me
just say cloning Dolly the sheep wasn&#39;t
the first cloned creature
so with the right electromagnetic pulse
it&#39;s very easy to clone a human or an et
or take tissue from one but you need
some kind of biological medium and
that&#39;s what the the cattle mutilations
provide and the other animal mutilations
provide the biological medium for these
experiments in the development of
man-made fake ETS and by the way there
was an intelligence official who kept
calling Stan Romanek telling him when he
had that creature come into his kitchen
and said stan is one of the fake ones
and he didn&#39;t know what it meant I went
out there with a MUFON investigator who
investigates abductions I said yeah it&#39;s
a fake one he said what do you mean I
said I&#39;ve been talking about this for 20
years
the literature is replete with
the military involvement in these
abductions it&#39;s a fake one it&#39;s man-made
it&#39;s made to look alien to scare the
hell out of people but because it puts
fear out in the community I said it&#39;s
not extraterrestrial it&#39;s man-made but
the cattle mutilations do two things
they provide a nexus for more fear oh my
god no only are they abducting people
they&#39;re mutilating but then it creates a
source of biological substrate material
for the nano bio machines that are these
biologicals that look alien and that was
because they were taking them to Dulce
which was near his ranch same thing at
Pine Gap I have assigned physicists who
worked at Pine Gap in Australia and it&#39;s
all subterranean and he worked on
projects is we have these creatures
coming off like sausages on a conveyor
belt absolutely and I was at a meeting
in the Australia a couple years ago and
the Minister of Defense for Australia
was there you know anything about this
stuff we had a very interesting
conversation but I said no you wouldn&#39;t
I said our secretary defense doesn&#39;t
know about this either but that is
really what&#39;s happening so you have to
think that well if we can make our way
through this nexus of fear and false
information that has kind of colonized
everyone&#39;s mind then we can go out there
with Close Encounters of the fifth kind
teams and make peaceful contact with
these civilizations how beautiful and
that&#39;s why I tell people don&#39;t be afraid
of anything interstellar you should be
very concerned about paramilitary human
but the interstellar is not a problem
and I think you have to make a
distinction people say oh how do you
tell the difference well an ET craft has
no seams the light from it it&#39;s coming
from refined materials that are so pure
that the light itself looks like
celestial the beans themselves have a
completely non-invasive very intelligent
I mean IQ of 400 500 a train
and very conscious and spiritual the PLS
are menacing they&#39;re invasive the
man-made Lockheed Martin Northrop SAIC
man-made disc saucers triangles have
rivets and seams it&#39;s quite clear to
tell the difference but you need to know
there is a difference first because
otherwise you&#39;re going to think
everything is alien and it&#39;s not and
that&#39;s why I&#39;m doing this webinar with
thousands of people watching it&#39;s going
to go up on the on the web is that the
public needs to know the difference
between the real and the false and what
the agenda is for the false one and how
easy it is whether it&#39;s through a cosmic
9/11 or some other scenario to
manipulate the public into fear and get
on a war footing where we then suspend
our liberties our freedoms and spend
trillions of dollars and countless lives
in a concocted hoaxed battle don&#39;t be
fooled again
we need to not be fooled again and this
is the big one that we need to be wake
up to if enough of us wake up to this
and then go out and make peaceful
contact then those folks who want to see
us create a time of endless war can&#39;t
have their way they only succeed if you
are sheeple who are going to follow
along with the conventional wisdom like
zombies half asleep so I beg you to
share this with everything everyone you
know and go out there and make peaceful
contact the other thing I&#39;m calling for
is this whistleblower Act provision if
there are people in this audience or who
know people who have been involved with
these projects who can testify and if
there&#39;s an attorney team that will take
it we will initiate this lawsuit and the
next is mass defections all of you know
people who know people who know people
it&#39;s two or three degrees of separation
if you work your network those of you
listening who are in California in the
high desert there are people in Palmdale
near Edwards or people in Nevada
listening
right now you network in your community
you find people who are at these
facilities that I named and
unfortunately that document didn&#39;t make
it but listen to it and if they&#39;ve
worked on these projects related to ETS
UFOs POS program life-forms anti-graft
you may defect with impunity under the
National Security Act of the United
States why because we have proven today
that there are dozens and dozens and
dozens of officials in the US government
in the British government and every
other country who have been denied
access through a criminal enterprise a
racketeering influenced corrupt
organization the largest Rico in the
world that is involved itself in
corruption and therefore it cannot if it
is violating the u.s. the British and
other constitutions cite the National
Security Act to provide cover that is
why on 2001 Oh May 9th when we did the
disclosure project and I had 20 some
people the National Press Club over here
and then subsequently more than a
hundred that came forward in the book
and videos for disclosure none of them
even though they had top-secret
clearances on this issue none of them
ever got a phone call or a letter saying
be quiet because we had proven between
1992 and 2001 that this is an illegal
unconstitutional operation so anyone
listening who has a family member a
friend a neighbor someone you can
network who&#39;s been in this project or
are currently in those projects contact
me at our website serious disclosure sa
RI US disclosure calm we will treat you
with the greatest confidentiality now we
do not want to hear from secondhand
people unless you have dispositive
documents and proof only first hand
people who are there and who can prove
they&#39;re there so you&#39;ll have a dd-214
from the Department of Defense you&#39;ll
have badges
from your corporate access you&#39;ll have
stuff that can establish it and that&#39;s
what we require but those folks need to
come forward in a next wave of
disclosure and defect from this criminal
enterprise many of you I&#39;m addressing
you now don&#39;t know you&#39;re in a criminal
enterprise because the way compartment
and intelligence works you have a guy at
this desk doesn&#39;t know what the guy next
to him is doing because it&#39;s special
compartment and intelligence top secret
and that&#39;s the way it works there in
what are called silos but I am telling
you through these documents and this
testimony that the way this projects the
way these projects are managed it&#39;s
illegal and if it&#39;s illegal they cannot
cite you for violating the National
Security Act now Snowden disclosed
information that the President and
Congress did know about that&#39;s different
I&#39;m talking about disclosing information
that is not being shared with the
President or Congress and our a priori
illegal so the quotidian world of
top-secret the sort of everyday world of
top-secret I&#39;m not talking about that
I&#39;m only talking about unacknowledged
special access projects that deal with
the antigravity or gravity control new
energy ET UFO issue those things are
being managed in a corrupt Enterprise
that&#39;s illegal so you folks can speak to
anyone provide any material take any
document like some of these that I have
that are top-secret that have not been
Declassified no one&#39;s gonna come after
you now I did have an FBI gates say to
me once you know he says that&#39;s a
top-secret document if you share that
with anyone each time you share it it&#39;s
however many years in prison and
whatever zillion dollar fine I said
really
come put the bracelets on I said cause
my first call I was back when I&#39;d been
on Larry King I my first calls gonna be
the Ted Koppel who I know and Larry King
and a few other people the headlines
gonna be emergency doctor gets arrested
for disclosing top-secret document that
confirm
UFOs and that you guys killed Marilyn
Monroe you want that the headline come
get me then he looked at me said you&#39;re
crazy I said yeah like a fox I said it&#39;s
your worst nightmare this is your worst
nightmare
so that&#39;s the other part of disclosure
don&#39;t be a lone wolf don&#39;t be a bill
Colby do it come together with us with a
group of people another five 10 20 30
people deep inside the National trans
national security state the deep state
and come forward that&#39;s what I&#39;m calling
for people to do so that&#39;s one thing we
can do the other is to each of us form
our own ce-5 groups how many people here
a part of a c5 contact group somewhere
I&#39;m just curious yeah so a few of you
the rest of you need to do that we have
an app if you go to serious disclosure
calm and scroll down to the second
bottom half of the page there is
actually an app to train you in the
remote viewing and the contact protocols
and then there&#39;s another app a free app
that will show you who is on ce-5 teams
in your area and so you can register on
that put it you know create a new email
just for contact and ce-5 and start
going out under the stars doing this
because here&#39;s the power of mass
consciousness dr. John at Princeton the
prison engineering anomalies research
lab found that if one person put their
awareness on a random number generator
they could shift if the zeros to ones
are the ones to zeros just through their
conscious effect that&#39;s the power of the
mind our minds have infinite power if we
tap into that if two people do it who
love each other or United the effect was
exponential not arithmetic it wasn&#39;t
twice as much it was ten times as much
so when a group of people in higher
consciousness go out for the purpose of
making peaceful contact understanding
that our future is peace in the cosmos
and where our destiny is to become
extraterrestrials to other worlds
eventually where we will be interstellar
if you understand that and understand
then if you begin to do that don&#39;t worry
about what phenomenon happens
the process of doing it itself is
transformative and edifying so please go
and do that that&#39;s another thing you can
all do now I want to take the last few
minutes to just take a few questions
you&#39;ve got about 15 minutes and anyone
who has a question in the audience if
you can just yell it out and I&#39;ll repeat
it so everyone can hear it
yes Simeon
yeah he&#39;s asking about the you know the
Oh hearings in front of Congress and
this sort of thing here&#39;s the problem
with that in reality we&#39;ve already done
that we&#39;ve already given the full
dossier to every member of Congress I am
NOT sanguine that any member of Congress
is going to hold a hearing on this even
Kucinich who ran for president no eight
who had a sighting and a close encounter
he was outed by Shirley MacLaine
unfortunately and I&#39;ve known him for
years he became chairman of one of the
subcommittee&#39;s on government oversight
domestic he wouldn&#39;t do it because the
the social appropriate condemnation
critical ridicule is so great on this
subject it&#39;s more likely that more and
more people defecting and doing us doing
it through the new media and the
internet will create a title now at some
point either a contact event will happen
that cannot be suppressed or enough
critical mass of people a new wave of
people defect where it just reaches
critical mass but for the President and
the Congress to do it they will only
step in after we&#39;ve done the very big
heavy lift so I think disclosure is in
our hands and in my opinion in a sense
we&#39;ve already done it the majority of
Americans believe we&#39;re not alone 43
percent of Americans believe we&#39;re
currently being visited by ETS
two-thirds of the public believes
they&#39;re intelligent life out there and
we&#39;ve been historically visited so in a
sense that and I when I started the
project that the numbers were like 20-25
percent so in a sense we&#39;ve won that
issue it&#39;s when people talk about
disclosure I said well in a sense we&#39;ve
already done it what hasn&#39;t happened is
official disclosure but the problem with
official disclosure is that it&#39;s rare to
find a politician who has the courage to
make it their way through the
condemnation the ridicule or the threats
and the threats are serious and that&#39;s
why we knew we had such great hope that
Clinton by the way
Lawrence was hosting when we were doing
this briefing for President Clinton and
Hillary at the Rockefeller ranch you
know who stood up and stopped it
Hillary that&#39;s too dangerous we don&#39;t
hear anything more about it and we&#39;re
not going to pursue it so President
Clinton took the briefing guys huge
thing I put together and kept it in the
private quarters of the White House in
his bathroom actually debride and he
would scaley bring it out there was a
person used to live at the White House
as a friend of mine and he says yeah
he&#39;d bring it out into the living room
and he went through and he go I know all
this is true but they won&#39;t tell me a
thing not a goddamn thing that&#39;s what he
said so you know I just think that you
know for the chief executive or the
Congress to do it we&#39;re gonna have to
create events of contact events and it&#39;s
harder in America than any other country
because this country is the crown jewel
is not that magic doesn&#39;t have
subsidiaries globally but this country&#39;s
the crown jewel of the
military-industrial financial laboratory
technology complex dealing with this all
other countries are an order of
magnitude down in terms of what they
have and so for a president or a
congressman to really go full-bore at
this let&#39;s just say I&#39;m not holding my
breath
I&#39;m calling for it I think it&#39;d be great
if it happened but I think we&#39;re going
to have to do a lot more of the
groundwork ourselves the public it has
to be a mass public initiative both
making contact and bringing out more and
more of these top secret witnesses
before they will move off the dime yes
sir yes I know a number I named a few as
some are recently deceased some are
still living like you know Cheney
certainly a member Papa Bush is a member
some of these royal families have
representation but minor all you have to
do is look at the really top folks that
the Lockheed skunkworks saic Lockheed
Martin they&#39;re all involved you know you
have David Rockefeller used to be Chase
Manhattan Ben
that by the way is white Lawrence who is
his brother who was sort of the
philosopher keen of the family he wanted
disclosure and peaceful contact David
with the banking empire was jumping up
and down on his won&#39;t say what he told
me his toes and was furious if they&#39;re a
direct if they&#39;re directly involved in
the skunkworks and the cube yes they
would absolutely have knowledge and
there are people within the military and
CIA I know people to see I you who are
member of this group and what&#39;s
interesting when I first did their
meetings with the CIA director about a
third of magic supported the concept of
ending the secrecy in bringing this out
I&#39;ve been told that in the number is now
seventy percent are in favor and I&#39;ve
met with a number of they&#39;re more the
younger generation the problem is the
other thirty percent would drop them
dead just like they killed bill Colby so
it doesn&#39;t take them it&#39;s not a
democratic system it&#39;s who&#39;s willing to
be a murderer you know but who&#39;s willing
to kill who so it&#39;s in and the other
problem is that this route magic has
elements that are splintered off of the
main policy board the main policy
committee so the folks who have gone off
the reservation with electronic warfare
systems abductions mutilations those all
those guys are in a paramilitary special
operation the drug run its filing and
some of the people who are on the main
they don&#39;t actually have control over
what those guys are doing so people
should get rid of the idea of some sort
of top-down system the architecture of
this secrecy may have started that way
and much of it was under constitutional
oversight with with Truman and the
earlier Eisenhower years and then it
went south and and it continues to go
out of control spinning out of control
so that&#39;s what you need to understand
yes sir
okay there are agendas within this group
that are separate and competing and
sometimes they mesh one would be
macroeconomic global control they want
the oil system the central utility
system it&#39;s all a macroeconomic issue
for those guys those would be more of
the real politic folks like Papa Bush
then you have the people who I mentioned
or eschatology they would love to see a
final battle happen that would result in
the end of the world so that their
Messiah or their Christ or whoever would
return I mean they&#39;re religious nuts and
they make the Taliban look like liberals
then you well really then you have an
element that are sociopaths who really
like inless war they love torture they
like destruction they&#39;re addicted to it
and I met with some of these people they
are true Psychopaths and scary
characters and then you have an agenda
that has to do with the fact that
they&#39;re not so much still attached to
the secrecy but they don&#39;t know how to
come clean without it being the biggest
scandal in the history of the United
States and many other countries because
imagine this information coming out and
being confirmed and the world learns
that for 60 years we haven&#39;t needed oil
or gas or coal that there have been all
these things done I mean one of their
concerns is that it could result in so
much social instability they wouldn&#39;t be
able to manage it so there&#39;s a sort of
inertia to the secrecy a momentum and
it&#39;s very hard to stop it so those are
people who are just sitting on the fence
who are placeholders status quo holders
and a man that was good friends with Wi
met with him at the University Club over
here and he was sort of his adviser on
nuclear power and stuff like this and he
said you know he says I don&#39;t care if
your left/right liberal a conservative
Democrat Republican when you get into
that building and we
just down the road when tea at the White
House you govern as a conservative I
said what do you mean I said
he said you do not want to be in charge
when something this big happens and
manage that change I so I understand
what you&#39;re talking about
I had an admiral who is in charge of
CONUS who is part of and then another
guy named Admiral Harry train who became
a member of magic names I have a lot of
names and he and this guy said well
Jonas is continental United States
security and he says my job is to
maintain the homeostasis and of the
world energy supply just to have nothing
disrupted that&#39;s why we&#39;re in the Middle
East so heavily he says and you what
you&#39;re saying is true this should never
been kept secret it should come out but
I just want to retire from this command
and go fishing at my ranch out and I
think it was Montana or Wyoming he says
I just want to get out of this position
so you know you have to you know live in
their shoes for a minute and I have a
lot of compassion for that a lot of
these people have inherited this mess
that got started and this is why senator
Goldwater said to me he said you know it
was a goddamn mistake then and it&#39;s a
goddamn mistake now that this was ever
kept secret I&#39;m quoting directly I&#39;m
sitting in his living room and you know
so there are a lot of people who though
who find themselves as placeholders and
they just don&#39;t want to disrupt the
status quo so there are different
agendas for the secrecy some is global
domination macro economically some have
this quasi religious sort of end times
you know final battle and space nonsense
you know it&#39;s almost like you get into
the wackiness of science fiction but
it&#39;s real this dr. Strangelove Ian&#39;s
view some it&#39;s all just about
maintaining the status quo of how the
world operates because imagine if every
village in Africa and every place in
India had a free energy device they had
electrification refrigeration crops
could be grown under controlled
environments with zero energy cost you
would have the two and a half billion
people in China and India their economic
input would would be parity with the
United States we only have 300
so the US and Europe only has 700
million the rest of the world is 7
billion money flows to where economic
prowess and power is right that&#39;s why
America is the biggest economy China is
about to get there but but besides the
globe but this would change the
macroeconomic thing over not almost
overnight certainly within a generation
15 or 20 years so those are folks who
are looking at the reality of that kind
of change ago no it&#39;s too big of a
change now that has been going on for 60
years or more I mean the secrecy on the
energy stuff has been going on for a
hundred and that&#39;s what has led us to
the precipice of an environmental
meltdown and global injustice and as
more and more people are impoverished
and a more and more elite parasitic
kleptocracy has the money this is a
prescription for a global revolution and
upheaval and terrorism so the more we
stay on this path the harder it&#39;s going
to be so even though the change is
daunting to take on it&#39;s still the right
thing to do and the longer we put it off
the harder it&#39;s going to be so my advice
has been for 20 years meeting with
people in high places do it but it&#39;s
easier said than done another question
yes ma&#39;am
it&#39;s great question yeah how do we help
our children and our educational system
and get them into this new paradigm you
have to do it yourself the system will
take too long to catch up it&#39;ll
eventually get there so when you start
talking about the whole area of
consciousness studies high-tech sciences
you&#39;re not gonna be able to get that at
MIT or in your public schools but we as
parents can provide that information to
to our children the other thing is to
encourage them to take risks I mean now
we have bubble kids you know everyone&#39;s
a bubble kid I mean I was raised I was
ran all over the city while now you know
you my parents would have been in prison
we don&#39;t that we don&#39;t let children take
any risks but you know what we become so
cowardly and timid that if our myth my
parents generation were like that we&#39;d
all be goose stepping date off Hitler so
now there&#39;s an adolf hitler
that&#39;s this sub rosa fourth reich and we
have to have the courage to stand up to
it now there are costs to that i&#39;ve had
a lot of i paid a very steep price but i
think ultimately you don&#39;t have you you
have to begin to embrace a bigger vision
so i&#39;d say the first thing with our
children
