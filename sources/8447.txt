My Descent into Death by   Howard Storm

In the thirty years since Raymond Moody's Life After Life appeared, a familiar pattern of NDEs has emerged: suddenly floating over one's own body, usually in a hospital setting, then a sudden hurtling through a tunnel of light toward a presence of love. Not so in Howard Storm's case. In MY DESCENT INTO DEATH: A Second Chance at Life (Doubleday, February 15, 2005; $14.95; Hardcover), Storm tells a compelling, personal and utterly different story of his near-death experience that is sure to astound and captivate readers everywhere. &nbsp;

Storm, long a devout atheist, was awaiting emergency surgery in a foreign country when he realized that he was at death's door. He found himself out of his own body, looking down on the hospital room scene below. Rather than going 'toward the light,' he found himself being torturously dragged to excruciating realms of darkness and death, where he was physically assaulted by monstrous beings of evil. His description of pure terror and torture is unnerving in its utter originality and convincing detail. Desperate to escape, Storm decided to pray. Struggling to remember how, he blurted out anything he could recall that included the word 'God,' from the Pledge of Allegiance to the 'Battle Hymn of the Republic.' It was then and only then did he feel these beings   slowly back off.&nbsp;

Finally, drawn away from death and transported to the realm of Heaven, Storm met angelic beings as well as the God of Creation. In this fascinating account, Storm tells of his 'life review,' his conversation with Jesus, even answers to age-old questions such as why the Holocaust was allowed to take place. Storm was sent back to his body with a new knowledge of the purpose of life here on earth. MY DESCENT INTO DEATH is his message of hope. &nbsp;

Storm's riveting account of his near-death experience has already had a profound and transformative effect on many, including best-selling novelist Anne Rice. She felt so extremely moved by his experience that she set forth to help get it published and into the hands of readers, while also writing a special foreword and embarking on a national publicity tour with Storm. As it did with Rice and others, MY DESCENT INTO DEATH has the power to infuse countless readers' lives with new clarity and meaning.&nbsp;
