The bleeding had already reached the ventricle and the surgeon did not raise my parents' hopes.  Drainage had been set by undergoing surgery. After this incident, I was in intensive care for 4 weeks and then I was in a special clinic for an additional 4 weeks due to a coma. When I came out of the coma, I felt good like I had had a relaxing sleep. I could not remember anything of the last 8 weeks except for a dream I supposedly had. 

In this dream, I 'flew' over the hospital where I was having the treatments and I saw all from up there; the parked cars, the entrances designed as winter gardens flooded with light. I felt light in weight and secure in a warm manner. In fact, I already had been in this hospital about 10 years earlier to visit my grandma and at that time, these entrances did not exist yet in this form. 

I assumed that it had all been only dream. When I had to go there for a computed tomography 9 months later, much to my surprise, I noticed that everything I saw in my 'dream' was real. Therefore, I asked my parents how I was taken to and from the hospital. 'In the back entrance' was the answer. During my stay in the hospital, I never left my room in the intensive care unit. Not only this 'flying experience', but also my entire disease changed my life and my life changed me. Despite a little handicap, I am satisfied, I am hopeful and I feel really fine.
