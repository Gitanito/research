     Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Indianapolis, IN.
 1/1, June 1888.  16 pp.  Organ of the Order of the Eastern Star, an adjunct body to Freemasonry, for wives and daughters of Masons.

 Perhaps an unlikely inclusion in IAPSOP, but the overlap between membership in the OES and Spiritualism is greater than one might think.
