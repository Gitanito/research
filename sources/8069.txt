I was driving home from my job as school librarian when I met a Fort Riley soldier who crossed the highway line and hit my car head-on.  His small truck then went up onto the top of my car and over the right side.  The driver was barely injured and walked, but I was almost killed.  I don't remember the accident at all, but this is what the highway patrol who put the accident together told me.
