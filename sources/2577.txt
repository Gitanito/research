To tile Ancient and )Honourable FnAl'ERNITY of FREE
and AccEPTED MASONS.
GENTLEl\IEN .AND BRETIIREN,
THE Antiquity of your excellent Fraternity, the uni-
. versality of its plan, and- the moral rectitude and
purity of its design, claim a decided pre-eminence over
every otl1er Bond of Society into which mankind have
ever formed the111selves for the mutual 'velfare and hap-
piness of each other.. The noblene-
ss of soul which first
prompted to its institution, and the benevolence of fteart
which has ever si11ce prevailed throughout all its tnembers,
will remain a subject of lasting admiration ! ·
To you, 'therefore, as the pro1noters of liberal senti-
ment, and the guardians of· every useful science, I com-
mit ~ this venerable pile of ancient Astrology; a fabric ob-
viously constructed by the Great Architect of the World,
primeval with the Ordination of Nature, and i~Jseparable
from one of the grand subjects of your official contem-
plation.
This science, by being little known, and less un~er­
stood, rnay meet with censure · and disapprobation from
that description of learned, as well as of illiterate, men,
whose rule of faith uniformly keeps pace \vitl1 their own
'
arbitrary conceptions. But th~ dispassionate part of
mankind, with ,every good Mason, \viii candidly \veigh
the evidence '' by the balance of the Sanctuary,'' and
reserve their sentence till after a fair and impartial trial.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE
TO THJS
NEW E D I T I 0 N..
FLAT'fERED, as I have been, by an uncommon demand for the former
editions of this \vork; and honoured by letters of unbounded approb:nion
and applaufc, from fome of the highefi and moft venerable charaCters in
the Britilh Dotninions, I could no longer forego their importunities ro
bring for\vard the prefent new edition, \vhich will be found confiderably
improved, and fon1e of the prediCtions fo:etold in it upwards of (even years
ago, particularly concerning France, now actually fulfilled, and others
fulfilling every day.
When this publication \vasjirfl announced, many indeed were furprifed
at the ftrangcnefs of the doElrine; but none ventured to oppofe the rea.
fon and caufes on \vhich it depends. Some ingenious perfons, who then
doubted the poffibility of fuch a fcience-, having tried its rules for fpe-
culating into futurity, and finding them correfpond with truth, are no\v
become its \varmeft advocates. And I have no difficulty in declaring,
that all who conternplate this fiudy with candid and unbiaffed minds, \vill
foon be convinced of the high and important advantages to be dcrivc:d
frorn it, both in ternporal and eternal afr:1irs. .
lVIany, who.had been in the habit of reg3rding Elementary Philofopby
as a fable or a farce, have, in very recent letters, exptc:!red no finall de-
gree of pleafure to find, that the principles of this fcience, \vhich \vere
formerly held in fuch high veneration by the learned, are once more re-
vived and explained, and fitted to rcafon under ft1ch examples, as the
fcnfes cannot eafily 1nifl:ake. Indeed it is n1oft certain rhat they \Vonder..
fully agree \Vith the very nature of things, and correfpond \\'ith their ac--
cidental c.treas; and,· fince thefe caufes and cff~c1s flo\v by influx from the
celell:htl bodies, and thus jnfluence the ambient, the fcience claims pre..

eminence over its twin-filter Ajlronotny, which every one adm~res and ap-
proves. Yet aftronomy, divefied of this [peculation, and regarded only
as the explication pf cc;leftial·phenomena, is like a cabinet without a jewel ;
but, when united to elementary philofophy, it is replete with ufeful in-
ll:ruetion, and conduces to the. falutary purpofe of making mankind wifer,
happier, and better.
I
The track of.l\
""-ature is a ilraight and obvious road; and yet her foot-
fieps are often fo fccretly condud:ed, that great perfpicuity is requifite to
purfue her with effea. The min~ of man is unqueffionably too n1uch.·
clouded wholly to con1prehend the immenfe fabric of an all-\vifc and in..
finite architeCt ; and he tnight as \Ve11 attempt to empty with a cup the
io1menfe \\7aters .of the deep, which ~re. o_~ly as a fingle drop, cotnpared
\V
ith·the Omnipotence of the Creator, as to attetnpt to rneafure, by the
utt110ft ftrctch of hurnan capacity, tl}e boundlefs extent of the furrounding
heavens. Yet, in things \vhich more imrnedjately concern ourfclves, a.nd
our future fate and fortune, the perq1anency of etnpires, and the prof-
perity and happinefs of tnankind, as the fame refult frotn the natural·con-
fequences ofgood and evi1,~ regulated by our choice of either; fo far we are
qhalified with ability to forefee, by contempl~ting the influx or influences
by \Vhich they are governed. "fhus, fron1 the writings of the moll: etni-
nc.nt men in philofophy and the mathematics, itnproved by my own la-
borious application and experience, I have at length afcertained thofe
powers and properties in the celeftial regions, from whence thefe ·in-
fluences are condufted, and \\'hich open a door for the difcovery of fecrets
in futurity replete with wonder, deduced from the firft and efficient pro-
pert1es, paffions, n1otions, fympathies, and aCtive qualities, of all things;
which, if reafon and truth had not repeatedly confirmed, to the full con-
vittion of my fenfet, I fhould have conde1nned and rejected long ago-
for reafon and truth_have uniformly guided the innun1erable experiments
of my laboratory, and !hall ever influence the pen v;hich communicates

ENSIBLE as I a~ of the. rooted prejudices of the times againft
the venerable fcience of Afirology, and fenf1ble alfo of the reproach
nnd obloquy that will be levelled againft me by men of obftinate
and dogmatical principles; I iliall neverthelefs venture, upon the b1fis of
TRUTH and EXPERIENCE, to n1ake this feeble effort towards refioring a
competent knowledge of that comprehenfive fcience, \S.'hich in all ages
. of the world was deetned the chief ornament of fociety, and the dillin-
guilhing excellence of enlightened mind~. It is therefore to be lamented
that the cultivation of it is become obfolete and unfalhionable ; and that,
O\ving to the violent difiurbances at the clofe of the lafi: century-to the
want of recent inforrnation on the fubject, and to the too-refined notions
of modern philofophers, its congenial rays have been fo long \Vithheld
frorn iliedding their divine light upon thefe kingdoms.
That an Afirology in the heavens does really exill:, and was ordainedof

incident in nature cannot cotne to pafs \vithout a caufe; and that thefc
caufes are inceifandy giving birth to a ne\v fate, which at one time brings
us con1fort, nnd at another ovcr\vhelms us \vith misfortunes; that lo-day

every io1ugination of our hearts; it is firange \Ve lhould deny that fuch

or ill fuccefs that conflandy attends al1 hu1nan purfuits. To iJJuftrate
this obfer\·ation n1ore fuJJy, let us atten tively con Cider the fiu pencious
frame or tnodeJ of Nature, as laid do\vn in the holy Scriptures, and en-
deavour to deduce therefrom the fubordinate dependence of one part upon
~nether, from the interior heavens to the minutefi· fubfiance upon earrh.
Hence we may poffibly difcovcr the origin of thefe caufcs, and prove thlt
Aftrology does not exift in imagination only. ,
The fubfl:ance of this great and glorious frame, which the Almighty
_€rented, "'e call the wor)d, and 'the world confifis of the heaven and the
earth•. The 1node_) ·of it is, as the prophet Ezekiel dcfc:ribes it, in the
form of a wheel t; \vjth ·n1any vtheels. \Vi thin the fan1e, involved one
,~. ithin anor her. i\nd thus we :find it by rnathematical demonftration;
for the earth is a \Vheel or globe of fea and land, circumfcribed by the at-
n1ofphere, as within·a greater \vhee1, which is globous too; and furrounded
, by the heavens, a~ by many wheels involved one within another,.encircling
the fun, rn_oon, ?.nd fiars-, and all the haft of them. The power, \Vhich
firll: a::t uated a_
nd put thefe wheels in perpetual n1otion~ was the fame
which called them into exilt~nce; the executioners of whofe \vill are re-
prefented by the prophet under the fimilitude of .four living creatures,.
itnmeafurably endued with w_ifdom, cou~age, agility, and llrength- And.
hence were life, and fpirit, and power, and virrue, communicate'd to the
heavens, and from the heavens to the earth, and from the earth to man:
and beafi, and to every· plant, and herb, and earthly fubfrance. Hence
alfo are derived the magnetic powers, and ~ondt!rful properties of na-
ture; the virtues of fympathy and antipathy, the invifible effed:s··of at-
traCtion. and repulfion, and all the various influences of the fiars and.
planets.
The proper agtnts of this noble frructure are angels and men ; the·
one compoft:d of a pure ethereal fpirit, and incorruprib)e; the other, in.
his primary fiate 1efs pure, but incorruptible alfo until his fall, \vhich'
brought upon himtelf nnd offspring mortality and death. The angels nre·

Works of fallen ~tnan are yet upon the anvil, and ti1ne Vlith US is frill going
on. But man is now endued, as in his prirnary ftate, with the agency of
a free will, and hath good and evil, for a tell: of his,obedienc~, continually
fet..before him, \Vith freedom to choofe either. And thus, unconfirained
either by the in1n1ediate l:land of God, dr by the operation of the planets
as fecond caufes, fome embrace life, and others feek condemnation; and
. hence follow virtue and vice, profperity and ·adverfity, ficknefs apd health,
life and death, and a11 the viciffitudes of Fortune. 1\nd though the rife
and fall of empires proceed from the virtues and vices of thofe _men who
govern and inhabit them; and thefe virtues and vices proceed from the
free will or agency of thofe men ; and though the incidents· good and
bad of one man's life are innumerable, and the men who are the fubjeEls
of thofe incidents in one lingle age are innumerable alfo; and though
the ages of men,- fince the creation of fhe world, are_ innumerable too;
yet have all thefe multiplied incident..s, \vl~ether trivial or important, come
to pafs by a regular courfe or concatenation of caufes, originally im-
planted in the wheels or fr~me of nature. And with fuch minute per-
feCl:ion was this ftupendous frarne confrru8ed, that neither the fall of
rnan,-nor the tremendous lhock which agitated the \Vorld upon that af-
.fliding occafion ; not all the wickednefs of mankind in after.:ages, nor the
defolations which have rent t.he earth in confequence thereof; have yet
impaired the wheels of this afl:onifl1ing machine, or for a moment im-
peded its conftant and unceafing. motion. And fuch \vas the amazing
foreGght and providence of God, that perceiving, at one view, all the .
events of futurity, the turnings and windings of every man's \vilJ, and the
total fum and upfhot of all v_irtue and vice, be at once contrived the fates
of profperity and adverfity, of rewards and punifi1ments, fo to con1e up,
as precifely to anfwer the virtues and prayers of the righteous, and the
vices ~nd profanenefs of the \Vicked, in all ages of.the world, at their fit
and appointed feafons.
Now all 1nankind have each·of them, tnore or lefs, a certain lhare of
wiCdo1n, po\ver, or wealth, wherewith they C?ccupy in this life, and carry
for\vard all their .undertakings. Thus we fee fome men, by means of
riches, courage, or contrivance, grow lnighty, and purpofe as if nothing
could impede the full accompliilinJent of their defigns; and yet \Ve find
there are two things which confound the wifefi, and greatefi, and prou~e[J:",
of then1 all, in the ·very fummat of their glory ;-thefe are, Time and
Chance-t\VO tnighty lords upon earth, which bring t:> pafs many firange.
and n1arvellous events.· Time is that motion of fpace which proceeded
o.utof eternity ~vhen the world began, and ho_ldeth on unto eternity, which
is to fucceed at the v;orld's end. Out ~of this one long time are engen-

fure, and another t in1e of paj n and gricf; a t ime to rj (e, and a t in1c to faIJ;
a time to be boru, and n. tirnc [o die. 1'herc is a certain lucky tin1e in

he carrieth the viclory; and there is onother tinlc wherein, though he go
out \Vith ever fo cornplcte a·n arrny, yet lhall he gJin nothing but ciigracet.
So alfo there is a tinlc \vhcn overtures of nJarnage fhall be fuccefsfuJ, but
a·man·s defires allf\ver it not; and again there is a time when defires of mar-
riage thall ilrongly urge, and all overtures prove inetfcaual i but there is
n titne alfo \vhcn defire-s and overtures !haq exaCtly correfpond, ~nd fuit

offer thcn1fel vcs,. and be attained, \V hether a man lleep or \Vake; and by
nnd by, though ·he purfue thesn \Vith wings, yet fo unlucky a time occurs,
~s renders all his endeavours fruitlefs. Sotne men cotne into the \vor!d
in a lucky hour, fo that, l~t them be \vife or fooli01, they (hall be buoyed

all that. they tc,ke to; \vhile \vi fer and better n1cn, fmitttn \Vith a~ un-
lucky tin1e of birth, !hall be as undefervcdly difparaged, and all their un-
dertakings fiutll prove unfuccefsful and unhappy. Some !hall be lucky
i n the van of t heir en t er prizes, and as unfort unatc in the rcar ; and others
again contrariwife. And thus tiote fccans to n1ock and fport \Vith the
men of this life, and to advance, or counterac1, all their 1kill and contri-

will bear the moft minute enquiry, and will be found the ordination of
an all-wife a~d indulgent Providence, for the fpecula.tion and improvement
of his creat'!lre man. 'And thefe lignific4tors reprefent, as it were, a feries
of curious knots, which untie by courfe; and, as every knot unties, dif-
ferent tin1es feem to fly out, and perforrn their errands; and of thefe,
fometin1es we may obferve t\vo, or three, or n1ore, lucky knots opening
together, and at other tilnes as tJ)any that are inaufpicious. Yet all tinJe;)~ ~
are beautiful in their jeqfons, if tnen could hit them; but through l he ma-
lignity of fin, and an intemperate purfuit of worldly pleafures, \Ve often
lofe the favourable time afforded us, pf embracing the Jnofi fub.fiantiat
h~ppinefs.
The fecond great lord over hun1an inventions, is chance. And thefe
chances proceed from a great variety of rare and fecret operations of hea-
ven, which throw in the 'Nay of men thofe firange and fortuitous turns of
fortune that furpafs all hun)an forefight or conception. And yet there
is really no fuch thing as chance in nature; but all thofe curious hits,.
that fi;ike in between the caufe and its effc~, \Ve c11l chances,.as belt fuit-
ing hutnan ideas, becaufe of the undefcribable properties of them. For
in 1huffiing a pack of cards, or in catl:ing the dice, it feems to us a mere
chance what <.·aft fhou]d ,happep uppennoft, or what card will go ·to the
: bottotnJof the pack; and yet it is evident by experience, that there is a
certain luck in nature, which prefides over all thefe adventures, fo that a.
man !hall either win or lofe in a methodical courfe. It alfo happens in the:
time of battle, and in every purfuit after \Vealth and honour, that chances
fall in upon us, and turn the fcale by a fecret kind of fate, beyond all
that could reafonably have been ex petted; and thus heaven breathes into.
all human aElions an infinity of thefe chances, that overturn the wifdom,.
and power, and all the greatnefs, of man. Thefe chances are uniformly
managed by a certain kind of luck, either good or bad, "'hich drives the
nail; and this, by forne heavenly influence, that infufes a fee ret virtue or
J10ifon into our aCtions, as courage into ·their hearts on one fide, or difmay
on the other; and ikill into fame men's heads to purfue the right collrfe
to be rich, or folly into others, whereby they run headlong to mifery and.
wan.t; or elfe fortunateth or infortunateth by miftake of words, fignals,
or acts, that turn to the bell: or worfi advantage, by ll:range hits 0r mif-
carriages; and thus it happens that a flight tnifiake in battle begets an utter
rout, after a viaory tnade almoftcomplete, by themere utterance ofa wrong
word, or fieering an in1proper courfe. But, which way foevcr it happens,
the whole n1atter is wrought by a good or ill luck, and the hand of God
is at the bottom of it; not by any new contrived act:, bot by the fan1e
regular courfe of nature ordained from the beginning of the world.

Thus both Tianc and Chance are the fervants of nature, under \vhofe
con1mands they f\vay the \Vorld, and worldly men; but by her laws arc
both of then1 difpofed. 'fime mcafures out the extent of tnen's lives, and
fets bounds how long they m:ty live by llrength of nacure, and how much
of that tiu1c !hall be extenuated by rneans of fin; and it alfo carves out
li1nits to the particular fates of all n)ankind; and Chance acts in obfePl-
ance of thotc lin1_
its, and brings about the good and bad fuccefs of every
fate. Aod thus,. by the fervice of Tin1c and Chance, nature perforn1s all
her great and feeret operations, whether upon colleCtive bodies, or places,
or perions. It may be thought firange that nature iliou)d bring forth men·
and wotncn :Jt a great difiance of years, hours, and places, all deftined to
die at one tinle, and by the fame rnanner of death, either by war, plague,
pcfi:ilence, or {hip\vreck; and that time and chance lhould pick thctn up.
and dra\V them together, fron1 a variety of different pur{uits, to partake
at Jafi in one and the fame defi:ructive fate. Yet this is no n1ore firange
than true; for thefe things frequently happen, and that by the irnper-
ceptible influences of thofe heavenly afpc:Cts and fiar~, \vhich riz their
courflsfought againfl Siftra*. And by the farne rule, as n1any •nen, \Vo-
n1en, and children, are, on the other hand, gather.ed together by a fimi-
lar force and virtue, to enjoy great and good fortune.
Some perhaps \vill contend, that thefe operations of nature are incotn-
patible \Vi th the free agency of man>s will. But, if \V hat has already.
been pren1iJed be attt'ntiveJy confidercd, this fuppofition \Viii. immedi-
ately vaniili; for God, who ordained the courfe of nature, certainly
forefaw the .nlinuteft turn of every man's \viii, and eventual1y contrived-
his fate to correfpond therewith, fo as to ad1n it its free and uncon trouled
choice. And whoever denies this antecedent principle, or prefcience of
God in the confiruetion of the world, denies one of his moft elfential
attributes. The \viii of n1an,_ without doubt. in a variety of infiances,.
makes great firuggles and \vrefilings \Vith the fiarry influences,, both-
in good and in evil purfuits, and often prevails over thetn exceedingly;-
for, though a perfon be born under fuch benevolent or maligna~t afpeCls,
as lhall point out his natural temper and difpoficion, and indicate .the
principal tranfatl:ions, fortunate or unfortunate, that are likely to be the
difiinguiihjng marks of his life; yet does it depend entirely upon the
free uncon trouled \\·ill of that man, whether. all thofe circuanfian~es, fo
pointed out in his nativity, lhall come to pafs, or not; becaufe the free
will in every man, when fortified by the habits of virt_
ueand \vifdom, often

fore, when God faith, Ltt thetn beforjigns", he .mufi fpeak in reference
,to nJan, whom be formed a rational creature, capable of difiinguifhing one
fign from another, and of improving by them. Nor are we to look upon
the1n as mere figns, like beacons·upon a bill, or as only fehing bounds to
days, months, and years; but \Ve are to confider them asjigns and token-s
of tho{e hidden events ?f futurity, \V hich it concerns eve_ry wife ai1d good
man to kno\v; and \V.hteh he may always forefee, -
by a v1rtuous anti faber
il:udy of .thefe intelligentJig~ts, placed by God for that purpofe in the ~r­
n1ament of heaven. .And that this was the intent of them, is clear.ly de:.
1nonfrrated by the words of our Saviour, \Vhen he foretold the defl:rutlion
;of Jerufalem, and the ·final confuxnmation of all things. His apofrles
a1ked him, What ihall .the Jign of thefe things be? .He replies, Earth~
.quakes, famines, and peftilences; fearful fights in the heavens., ·andfigns i~
the fun, in the tnoon, and i11 the Jiars..* Such alfo was the.Jign by which
the Eaftern fages difcovered the .birth. of our Saviour, and .the place of
his nativity; aud numerous other iuftances may be adduced both frotn
Jacred and profane hift0ry, in 1upport of this dotl:rine.-'I'he fourth ufe
of thefe celeftial.tuminaries, is for feafons. This is alfo obvious; for we
find that heat and .cold, and draught and.moifture, are all guided.and go-
verned by the heavenly bodies; and th~t not only fpring and autumn,
and fnmtner and winter, bear tefiimony of it; but \Ve have it confirn1ed by
the evidence ·Of our ow.n con.fritution and feeling; for, 'vheu the \veather
is heavy and lowering, 'Ne find ourfelves dull and languid; \vhen bright
and radiant, \Ve .are cheerful and merry; .and, when unfettled and untea-
fonable, we feel it .by indifpofition and tnelancholy; and ~his is a11 brought
,:bout by .the operation of thefe lutninaries upon the feaions of tbe year,
in the due courfe of nature. ·The next t1fe alloted them is, fifthly for
.days, and fixthly for years; and that thefe are tneafured out, and governed
~by ' thern, is every \vay apparent; by the fun's circuit, and the moon's
energy.-The fun, like a ftrong man, rejoices to .run his race; he rifeth
out of the chambers of the eaft, and wi~th golden rays di1pels the morn-
ing clouds, and exhales the pearly dew ; cheering and refre1hing all na-
ture \vith his prefence. Hence it is evident that thefe luminaries were
not onl.Y placed in the heavens to give light upon the earth, to govern
the feafoos, and to fe~ bounds to titne; but alfo to comtnunicate Jigtts
.aild tokens to tnankind, of things to carne. We !hall now confider how
far it is {criptural, and confonant to reafon, to allow thetn thofe INFJ~u­
E.N.CES attributed to them by Afirology.

That tl-ic fun, moon, and-all the planets, have a dirctl and obvious it!Jlu..
tnce upon earthly fubfianccs, no man of common obfcrvation will pretend
to deny. The fitu is the fountain of heat, and that heat is the nurfc of
life; and the moon is the fountain of moifiure, which tempers the vio-
lent heat of the fun, and modifies all his operations. Hut the fun and
tnoon, and all the planets, have ench of them a particular fjJecific pro..
perty, according to their O\VIl innate quality, and according to the nature
of that fign or bnnd of fiars, under \vhich they happen to IJe pofited.
This is a fact efiablithcd by repeated obfcrvation and experience; for
'vhetl the fun enters the equinoCtial fign Aries, the fj>ring begins to lhew
herfelf, and all vegetative nature, by the moon's' humidity, and the fun's
temperate heat, feetns to revive and flourifh, and, as it \V~re, to rife from
the dead; whither the cold blafis of the hyemnal air had before configned
it. So, \vhen his .radiant beams enter the fign Taurus, they fiir up the
benign inJI.ue?Zces of the Pleiades and Hyades; Hoedi being then to the
north, and Orion to the fouth, and Arcturus finking bclovt the horizon;
and their cold and tempefiuous· etfeCl:s ·begin to ceafe, as they are fuc-
ceeded by thefe benevolent confiellations, which produce \varm fouthern
\vinds, and gentle ihowers, repleniihing the earth, and caufing vegetation.
Again, \vhen the fun rifes \Vith the dog-fiar, \Ve find an i11)ittence \vhich
cauies vehemency of heat, contagion, ·and infirmity. l\1edicaments ad-
minificred under this conficllatiou prove hard and obnoxious; and \Ve
iind dogs at this time are apt to run mad: the fea is troubled \Vithout any
apparent caufe, and all nature feems more or lefs oppre!fcd by it; andr
yet thefc effeCl:s are never found to be equally violent in any t\VO 1ummers,
\vhich clearly proves an ilif!uettct in the fl:ars, as \veil as in the fun. And
again, though the fun keeps the fame- confrant and invariable courfe
· through the t\velve figns of the zodiac, for an infinity of annual revo-
lutions, )·et \Ve never find the feafons and. weather exactly correfpond,
\V hich they doubtlefs wou14 do, were it not that cold and heat, and \vind
and rain, are governed by the configurations the fun as with the planets
and fixed fi.ars, and this alfo evidently proves. the force of their influence•.
1t is likevvife 1nanifefi, that \vheuever the planet Saturn is paffing out of
<>nc fign into another, th~ \Veather is more or lefs turbulent and unfettled.
But if is not the \Veather only, nor the inanitnntc part of the creation
alone, that is affeCted by the influences of the fun, moon, and planets;
for \ve find they operate upon the human fpecies, and upon a1l animate
nature, in every part of.the \Vorld. The fun and the quality of the
heavens about the torrid zone, naturally occafion thofe men \Vho are born
and live under it to be quite black, with 1hort crifped hair' of a lnean
fiature, and hot confiitution, imbibing a fierce: and favage fpirit, and

this, by reafon of the fun's continualftay and po\ver in that fiery region-:..
lt is obfervable, that the inhabitants of the fot1th are of a better and~
quicker wit, and much more ingenious and traCtable; and this is ac-
. c.ounted for by their vertical point being fituated ·nearer the- zodiac,. in.
'vhich the planets move. So like\vife_the inhabitants of the north are of·
a ·firong body, but of rude ~anners and condition, becauie their vertical
point is placed at a great difiance from the fun's courfe; and therefore they
abound vvith cold and 'moifture, and are of a phlegn"atic con.ftitution, of
a· fair co1nplexion, tall~ courageous, and ingenious. . Europe,. being
fituated in th~ north-\ve:ll: part of the earth, is under l\1rtrs in Aries, and,.
by reafotl of this planet ruling in that triplicity, its inhabitant$ are na.,.
turally of a noble and magnani1nous fpirit, given to martial exploits, and ~ ·
feats of \Var; of a generous mind,.and courteollS manners. . i\nd thus the·
ft\n, modified by the different figns and coni1ellations through \vhich he·
pb!fes, regulates the c limates, and theds his influen~e upon all tnankind~,
len.yi-
ng behind hitn evident marks of his gqvernment and f\vay.. Some,
indeed, have a~tempted to account for the f\v_
arthy and black cornplexion
of the favage race, by a variety of other pla11iible conjcClu!es: but none
are to·be relied on, that do not attribute its caufe to· the intenfe heat and
po\ver of the fun in thofc clitnates; than \vhich nothing can be more
confouant to reafon.,. i1nce '''e find, even in this cot111try, that if we remaiu
long together in the fun, in the heat of~fummer, our complexions _
change,
and we become in a degree tanned and fwarthy..
Confpicuous as are the influences of the fun, thofe of the moon are no
lefs fo. , ~his is evinced by a confideration of that vvonderful and ncver-
ceafing operation of the moo~1 upon' the. ocean, fo as to occafion that per-
petual flux and reflux of the fea, vvhich we call tides. Here we. fe.e the
\Vaters of the vail: ocean, forgetful, as it were, of their natural reft, ffiO\'e ··
and roll in·tides obfequious to the firong attraCtive po\ver of the moon,
and vvith an iricreafe or diminutiop of for~e, in proportion as ihe appears
in firength or \vant ·of afpea. 'I'his is '!ll influence fo. univerfally ad-
Initted, and fo peculia( to that luminary, that it efiabliihes at once .the
doCl:rine \Ve contend for. But there are nutnerous other infiances of
the effects of the rnoon; no lefs common thati extraordinary, and perfeEtly
\Vell kno\vn. Thofe unhappy perfons who labour under a deprivation of
ienfe, and are affiicred \Vith ltUlacy, have their fits more violent and ter...
rible, in proportion as the tnoon increafes Gr ditninifhes in light and mo~
tion; and in all chronic and acute difeafes,. her po\ver and influence arc -
vifibly and forcibly felt. Indeed ev:ery fubj~a of the creation is q1ore or
lefs affeeted by the_ moon's energy; the eyes of ca~s are obferved to fvvell .

oottOP1 of the ocean,. are known to fee} the \\'eight of her influence.
Thofe ,vho tleep in the fields, or in any place expofcd to the open air, by
moon-liaht, find their heads opprelfcd 'vVith \Vater, aud their fcnfes inert
and hea~'Y; and butchcr.'s meat hung up, and expofed to the tnoon-light,
\vill {oon putrefy. The gardener alfo brings us abundant tefiimonie~ of
the influence of the moon upon the vegetable world. If peafe are fo,vn
in the incrcafc of the moon, they never ceafe b1ootning; and, if fruits
itnd herb~ arc fet in the \:vane, experience fhe\~'S they arc neither fo rich in
flavour, nor fo firong and healthy, as \vhcn planted during her incrcafc; {o
vines, becaufc they fhould not ~pread too fafi, are ufually prnned in the
\Vane. It is a)fo remarkable that a pomegranate \vill live only as many
years as the moon \Vas days old \vhen it \Vas planted; aud, in planting
fhrubs, or the like, if they are to !hoot up firaight and tall, and to take little
root, they are fct when the moon is in an airy fign and increafiug in light:
but contrarhvife \vhen they are to take deep root, a·nd to firike do\VU\vards.
And thus \Ve may obferve fl.o\vers that arc under the moon's influence
only open their bloffoms in the night; whilft thofe 'vhich are peculiarly
under the government of the fun open every morning \vhen he begins to .
1:ifc, and clofe in the evening \vhen he finks belo\v the horizon. Thcfe ·
effeCts and influences of the moon are fo co1nmon, and fo generally kno\vn,
that it \Vere ahnoft needlefs to repeat them here, but for the purpofe of
<3ra\v1ng this conclufion, that, as one planet has a known. and forcible
aCtion upon fublunary things, it is natural to believe that~ all the others
are endued in fame degree \vith a fimilar force aud virtue. Indeed moil:
phyficians kno\v that the planet Saturn rules all climaCl-erical years, as the
Su1.1 doth critical days, and the l\1oon the crifis of all acute dife~fes; and
that every·feventh y~ar Saturn cotnes to the fquare or oppofitiou of his
place in the radix of every man's nativity; and that, after the revolution
of the fun, he becon1es the chief ruler of .critical days, and is often
obferved, by his configurations \vith the moon, to fet aiic.le the fatal cri!is
of thofc deiperate diforders, over \vhich the patient 'vas not expeCled to
live. From thefe phyfical reafons, \ve may fafely conclude that Saturn
is by nature cold and 1nelancholy, as the Sun is hot and ·cheerful; and,
being thus oppofite to the fttn in quality and effect, fo is he in relation to
the tigns and manfions of the heavens \V here he bears rule, and therefore
inclines always to cold, as the fun does to heat. Hence it follo,v·s, that
when the fun is in 4quaries, 'vhich is the proper fign of Saturn, and op-
pofite to his O\''n fign Leo, the \Veather inclines more to cold than to heat ;
and, at every conjunction, fquare, or oppofition, of Saturn '\Vith the t\VO .
great luminaries, \Ve ahvays find the \veather cold, moifi, and lowering,
even in the midft of the fumrner, unle1s the rays of Jupiter or Mars iuter-
po!e, in \vhich cafe thtfe effects are fomc;what lefs vifible. Thus, \Ve

.to be compar~, in tbis reipecr, 'vith the 1inaHeft ~~ax-light ·; and this little·
light too is only to be had w'hen the nights are ferene and unclouded.

celeftial bodies~no injl{ten~es but \Vhat we ;no~.v and then
~catch \Vith our eyes, as they occafionaHy fjlarkle their dim glance~ upon

they aB:·upon all earthly things, as well by day as by night, and in cloudy
! as \veil asia clear v;eather. But, as their operations are not performed by
-· 1~Anfib1e and palpable n1eans, it' foJlovvs that they have a fecret and hidden·
way of rule, whereby the influences are i1nperceptibiy infufed into every
.concern of this life. And, as have the fiars, fo a1fo have the fun and
m<>Gn, a fecret and imperceptible action, peculiar to themfelves; for it is
not the ·mere heat that gives life, 11or the mere n1oifrure that {ufiain? it;
for, if that \Vere the cafe, then might man make living creatures artificially.
It is true that heat n1ay hatch the eggs, -but all the ingenuity of n1an can-
.not tnake an egg that can be hatched; for there is a fecret operation of
·the fun aud n1oon, independent of heat·and n1oifiure, neceffary to the pro-
duCtion of life, both in Yegctive and fenGtive. animals. And in thefe
fecret and infenfible operations, befides the lig'ltt that they give, confifts
that rule 'vhich the fun, moon, and fiars, \V·ere o;·dained to exercife ov~r

.\ Thus far both Scripture arid Reafon unite, in confirming our belief of.
the fiarry influence; but, ther~ are fo many other proofs·of it, in the or-
~inary productions ·of nature, that it \Vould be highly unpardonable \Vere
I .to pafs them over in iilence. The loadfione affords us one very ftrikino-
exanlple, by its attractive and expulfive faculty, and by the 1nag.netic vit~
tue it has a power of comtnunicating to other difrintl bodies. Thus ~N·e
Jee a needle, only touched with the loadfrone, and placed in the compafs,.
~vill conftantly point towards the north pole, and, though it be ever fo··
far difiant, or though rocks and rnou11tains, or even the earth~s body, in..
tervene, yet it retains this directive property in fo extraordina-ry a degree~
that it will continue precife1y in· the fame direEtion, unlefs violence be·
:ufed to prevent it.; and, even after it has been ren.1oved by force, it will of
!tfelf return to its former fituation, \Vithout the leaft fenfible difference•.
The properties of the loadfione in iriany other refpeB:s are-fo very ine?C-·
plicable, tqat the experiments of our 1nofr celebrated tnodern mathetna-
tiGiaus have not been able to afford us a fatisfaB:ory definition of them..
This ho\vever is certain, that it could not poflibly in1bihe thefe miracu-

are certain there never was more than one creation, \vhich -,.vas at the be- .

if fo, then mull: thefe things come to pats by an earthly means alone, or

a general foul in the 'vorld, through the means of \vhich they come to
pafs in a due order and courfe of nature? Utrutn horunz 1Jlavis accipe; I
contend for no more. "In the beginning God created the heaven and
the earth; and the earth .\vas w.ithout fortn, and void, and darknefs '"a~
llpon the face of the deep, and the fpirit of G·od n1oved upon·the face of
the \Vaters." I1ere, when there \vas nothing but earth and 'vater, and
darknefs overfpread all, the Jpirit of God :tnaintained that chaotic .tnafs,
and managed the.. earth by the water, and the water and darknefs by
bin1felf.. But 11ow both the earth and water are ~nder theface of heaven,
and the light is .uphn this heaven, and the fpirit of God moveth upoti· the
face of the heavens in that light; and, as he aauates the earth and the
\Vaters by the heave1zs, [o doth he aCtuate the heavens by hinzfi!f. And
-agreeably to this idea fpeaks the prophet Hotea, when he fays, God will
hear the !Jtave?Js, and they foal/ hear· .the earth, and .tlte earth the cor11 a11d

fuch compliances and differences as \VC kno\v they do, at the atnazina

unlefs forrte faculty exifis in the \vorld, that is capable of fufiaining this
invifible correfpondency bct\veen one creature and another? \Vhere life
.is, -thele things .are eaGly e.ffi!fted; as the child in the \vomb is nourilhcd
. by the food the mother eats; but in the inanimate part of the creation,
\ve are at a lofs \vhich \vay to account for it. No\V admitting that there
really is fitch an univcri:1l.foul cxifring, yet is it quefriouable \Vhethcr
this foul be i1Jtel/cflual, or·merely vegetivt. . Tl1at there is an inttl/~,?ua/
po'l.oer infonning the :\vnole \Vorld, as the foul does the body, .is not to be
doubted; for other\vife the whole .frame of nature would be inert ·and
motioulefs; ·but then, if we admit the foul of the 'vorld to carry this in-
tellect .in its o\vn brain, it \\',ill follo\V, that this foul is a God; for an
- intelleCtual being, filling ·heaven and earth \Vith its prefence, i~ an attri-
bute of God.*",. Hence I ·conclude there .is an tlniverial foul in th·e
\Vorld, but that it is only vegetive, and .not i1JtellcBual; and that in this
foul ~d\veils the fp.irit of Almighty ·God, ~\vho filleth ·the heavens and the
earth \vith his prefence., and .from :;hence .garnilheth the heavens, ahd
caufeth the precious influences -of the :fun, 1noon, and fiars, to ·be difiri-
bitted into all parts of the 'vorld. § And thus God rules immediately in
the ·heaven·s, but rules .the \Vorld 1nediately ·by the heavens. It is true,
indeed, that God is equally \veil able to govern and maintain the \vorld
\Vithout m·eans, as ·he•\vas at :firfr to conll:itute and create the frame of na-
·ture; but fuch is His divine \vill and pleafure, that he has thought fit to
bring all thing$ to pafs by virtue of means, as ordained from the beginning
of the \Vorld. .It is a common and tru.e maxim, that God and nature
have 1nnde nothing in vain ; and yet it is as true, that grafs arid herbs
gro\V lvhere no. creatures live to eat them. t N O\V \vere the world go- ·
ven1ed by God's immediate prefen.ce on1y, then "'ould the produCtion·of
this gra{s and herb be a \vork in vain ; becaufe God's \Vord brinQS
forth all things at pleafure; and, having a po\ver of increafing or din11-
nifhing its operation in a moment, \\'ould certainly not have brought forth
this fertility in an uninhabited ·and ·defolat~ country.· But nature running
her courfe by a confiant and \lnchangeable decree, ·has no po\ver to ceafe
her \Vork \Vithout a:miracle; and therefore, though the grafs may gro\v in ·

Kno'Lun unto God are all his works,froJn the begt"'nning ifthe 'l.Vorld;* and
therefore it would be derog~tory to the attributes of the Deity, not to be-
lieve that the minutefi events of this w~rld were fot~efeen and provided
for in that mofr perfeCt frame qr model of nature, 'vhich, as we have al-
ready feen, may..~e cornpared to the confiruetion of a \Vatch,, confifiing of
many fmall 'vheels, regulated by one mailer-wheel, or firft mover, wnich
being 'vound .up ~t the creation, ~ith the line of time, , of a f~en1ingly
infinite length; has ever fince been .winding off, unto the prefent hour;
anrl yet ·-is there fiill mor~ line upon the 'vbeel; but ho\V m\.1Ch remains,
is.only in the breafr. of the Almighty. ·And wheri this line ihall be en-
tirely wound off, then \vill t~e frame of nature find its period,f and al.I
fi1bordinate wheels 'vill ceafe their (notion. But, until that time, there
is allotted -- in this frame of nature,· unto·every one that comes· into the
w~orld, a .certain order or courfe of life, by which he ruas through fick-
l1efs and health, honour and diihonour, and· all· the occurrences of lifeJ
from his cradle to the grnve. · For tnan is, as it were, a little world within
himfelf; and, though he.fiand .but as one wheel in the fra.ine of the great
\Vorld, yet within this one there feem many thoufands of 'vheels, ' efpe:.
cially in eriterprifing people, 'vhich appe~r to move one withir} another
almofi ad injnitu1n, till the thread ·turned on the outer wheel break', or
elfe be 'vound off, ~and there they make a fiop, and die. All thefe things
God, \Vho made man at the firft, perfeCtly know·s,· and"foreknew·from
the beginning of the \Vorld; and, by this order of man's life, -he perfectly
knows all the paffages of our lives, and even the p10fr fecret. thoughts of
our hearts, both fleeping and waking; +and how one thought drives off
and brings on another, and continues fa doing till the lafi tnoment of our
life, \Vhen our breath fails. Now. every man being,. ~s it were, a \Vheel
of the great \Vorld, it \vill follow that all men move in a certain fratne Ol'
\Vheel.above then1felves, by vi'rtue··of which the mafie·r~wheel of every
man's life is put in motion: and .this \Vheel is fi.1bordinate unto.others,
and thefe alfo unto the .mafier-\vheel of the whole World, \Vhich is the
high and mighty wheel of heaven, 'vherein the fi.u1, moon, and fiars, are
, iet, to carry on the great \Vorks of nature, unto: the end oftime. . Ana
hence comes the original of every man's nativity, ai1d ofall natural qua...
lities, paffions, and ineidents of our lives, except the motions of our free..
'A'ill and reafon, \vhich may be allured and inclined by the \Yorks. of na..
ture, but cannot be forced by them. Now above and beyond this great
wheel of nature, there is.yet another wheel, within.which the heavens
themfelves are turn~d; § and herein is that great and hidden line of time,
whereby the whole world, with all its dependencies, is made to hold on
and continue its motion, unto the final end of all things; and this ftu-

\
From 'vhat has been advanced, it appears obvious that every occurrence
of our lives, and all the various produtlions of nature, ho\vever firange
or incomprehenfible th~y may appear, arc brought to pafs by a regular
and eftabli!hcd means, ·decreed by the ,,,i((lom of God, at the begin-
ning of the \vorld; and confequently, \Vhatevcr happens by a contrary
efFete, mufl of necefiity be produced by the itnmediate hand of God, and
confiitutes a 1niracle. ·Such \Vas the cafe \vhcn the Almighty made the
fun and moon ftand frill; and \vhen, at the prayer of Ifaiah, he reverted
its courfe, nnd made it retrogr·ade. Such alfo \vcre the \Vorks of our Savi...
our, when he raifed the dead, and gave fight to 1nen born blind. And fuch
\vas the \vork of God, when the tea made a lane for men to pafs through
on dry ground, and \vhen the fire had no power to fcorch, nor to burti
thofe who walked in the tnidfi of it.f The1e miracles, it is true, had
no immediate dependence upon the \Vorks of nature; and yet, as God
from the beginning fa\v the neceiity of them, and~ the occafton upon
'vhich they \Vould be required, it is reafonable to fuppofe he fet do\vn in
his eternal mind the contrivance of thefe miracles, and fo ordained them
to keep pace \vith the \vorks of nature, and to come to pafs at their ap-
pointed featO_ns, \Vithout difi1.1rbing or deranging that univerfal friime of
the \Vor1d, out of \vhich all natural things proceed, and from \vhence aU
the boil: of heaven derive their £1culty of influencing earthly fubfiances.
Anq that the heavenly bodies poffefs thefe influences, in au infinitely
powerful cl_egree, I believe \Villnot be denied, fince both fcripture and
reafon, as 've have now feen, fubfiantialJy prove them. The ancient
philofophers \vere unanimous in fubfcribing to this opinion, even \vith-
out the tefiimony of the fac:red writings; a9d many \Vere learned authors,
in later ages, have fupported the fame doCl:rine. Milton gives us a very

Their influence tnalignantwhen to ihow'r; ·
Which of them·rifing w·ith the fun, or falling,
Should prove tempejiuouJ, &c.*
The ingeni9_us Mr. Fergulfon alfo.proves, in a"'variety of infiances, an
efficiency and.i~fluence in the fun and moon: though he detiies that any fuch
faculty exifts in the fixed fl:ars. And yet he has ihewn, by very fatisfac-
toryiobfervations, that "the fixed fl:ars are .fo ·many glorious funs, with ·
fyfiems and worlds ft1rrounding them fimilar to our O\Vn ;" and that ·
" the Almighty would not have placed them at fuch cliftances from each
other, unlefs proper objects were near enough to be benefited by their
influences.'' Hence it follows, from his O\Vn hypotheiis, that.the fixed
ftars do each of then1 poffefs a natural influence, homogeneal· to the fun·
and moon.t But to \vhat difrance the fixed frars, or ai1y of the .heavenly
.bodies, are capable of extending thefe influences, is beyond the power of
the p10ft enlightened mind to determine; finc·e the celefiial matter flows
through a boundlefs and unlimited fpace, and operates upon every fub-
france that falls vvithin the line of its direcrion.. At1d now, having made
it apparent, by an union of concurrent te:ll:imonies, that the fun, moon,
and ftars, have their refpeB:ive in~uences, ~nd· that an Afrrology in the
heaveus does by confequence .cxifr_
, it \Vill be proper to confider how far
the frudy of this noble fcience is co1npatible \vith o~r moral and religi-
OQS obligations, and what degree of it is attainable by the human un-
de,;fiauding.
That the frudy and praCl:ic.e of Afirology is a moral purfuit becoming
fober and religious men, ~ay be colleeted from the cuftoms of the an-
cients in all enlightened countries; as well as from the befi and \vifefi: of
God''s chofen people. And that our a'll-\\1
ife and beneficent Creator
originally itnplanted in the fratne of nature a tneans whereby mankind
may attain to the kno\vledge of fuch future contingencies as concern their ·
v/elfare and happinefs, is in rio refpect to be doubted, fince "'e ob!erve
in the brute ct:eation, that even the mofr inconfiderable creatures upon
the earth are ·more or 1efs endo\ved "'"'ith a gift of foreknowledge. Thus

vide themfelves a magazine of plants and herbs, which they forekno\v will
enable them to lie concealed in their holes, during the hard frofl:s of

holes arc alfo confiruCted with amazing art, and have generally tvvo
apertures, that, in cafe one is bcfct by an enemy, they may efcapc by the
other. The doublings of the hare, and"thc tricks of the fox, to efcape
the hounds, are al1o afionilhing indications of forcfight and fagacity.
The feathered race are likc\vife endo\ved with a fitnilar faculty, and often

it is clear frotn the above, that figns of great and direful events are difco-
verable not only by the cclefiial bodies, but alfo by fearful. fights in the
heavens; by tremendous earthquakes; by total eclipfes of the t\VO great·
lutninaries, 'vhich deprive them for n tin1e of the po\verof giving light;
and by other extraordinary pheno1ncna, \vhich fhould ahvays be attended
to \V ith reverence and a\ve. Thefe figns our Saviour informed his difciples.
fl1ould precede the defrruClion of Jerufalem; and afirologcrs, and·other

and it muft be {elf-evident to every thinking tnind, that the laO: day

N O\V if \ve confider aftrology, \\'hat it truly· is, a legal and virtuous~

inil:rueted in a forekno\vledge of futurity, by the exprefs command' of
God, as a means of enlarg.ing his mind, and alleviating his_difuefs, upon'"
being turned adrift into the wide world. Jofcphus, an bifiorian of cha-
racrer and eminence, who quotes the molt ancient authors of refpcClability
for \vhat he alferts, confirms the fame thing, and furthe\ tnfonns us, that

To this effect 've find Saul.and his fervant difcouriing, \vhen they \vere

practice to be highly confifient \vith all our moral and religious duties..
That .the human underfianding is alfo capable of attaining to a very
high degree of kflo\vledge in the hidden \Vorks of futurity, and iu the .
fccret operations of nature, is likewife to be proved, beyond the po\ver
of contradiCtion. Indeed the paifages already quoted fron1 the holy
fcriptures., are a fufficient confirmation of it to every difpaflionate reader;
but as there are iome very extraordinary infiances of this preditl:ive fa-
culty, recorded by different hifiorians, I \vill jufl: mention a fe\v of
them, by \vay of corroborating the e\'idence already brought in its fup-
port. The E1nperor Dotnitian required the profeffor l..,argius Proculus
to calculate his nativity, from the ft1ppofed tin1e of his birth, "·hich \vas
done, and delivered into the emperor's own hands. Afclatarius, a n1ofi:
f:1mous afirologer of thote t itnes, procuring a copy of this natiYity, rec-
titled it, and foretold the hour and manner of the emperor's death; \Vhich
when Domitian heard, he com1nanded Aiclatarius to be brought before
l1im, \\'hen he affirmed his predicrions \vould prove true. Domitian afk-
ed hitn if he could foretel the tnanner of his O\Vn death? Afclatarius re-
plied, That he kne\v he fhould fhortly be torn in pieces by dogs; but, t.o
confute the aftrologer, the en1pcror ordered him to be burnt a1h·e. The
poor fello\Y \vas accordingly led for execution; the body \Vas bound and
laid ·npon the pile, and the fire kindled; but at that infiant, there aro1e a

,ex~inguifhed the fire; and Afclatarius \vas after\vards torn in pieces by·
.. dogs, as he bad foretold. When Latinus informed the emperpr of thi~

. a<faffination had been predicted, he feigned himfelf indifpofed, and locked
-himfelf up in his chamber~ Stephanus, the captain of his guard, \Vent to-..
his door, pretending he had received fome i1nportant difpatches·, \vhich
he wanted to deliver to him; but, Domitian declining to admit him till a

him to the heart, in the very hour that had been predicted by the afiro- ,
-loger, on the eighteenth day of September, Fhc month he had ordered to.
be called permanicus.* The fame \vriters add, that Apollonius Tyaneus
was at that infiant of time at E phefi.1s, franding in the prefence of the
· rnagifrrates, and in a kind of ecll:acy, cried out, 0 Stephanus, firike the
tyrant; and after a paufe, added, It is well, thou haft killed hi1n. This art
of recrifying nativities \VaS a difcovery which brought the fcience to very·
hjgh perfection, and has cu.abled its profe!fors to be afroni!hingly exact in·
prediClion5 of confeqnence. Thus Lucius Tarutius Firmianus, by the
acts of Romulus's life, and the time of his death, found that he '~7as born
in the firft year of the fecond Olytnpiad, the ~\venty-third day ·0f the
month, about fun-rifing. And hence he difcovered that the· building of
Ron1e was begu11 when the Moon was in Libra, the Sun \Vi_
th Mercury, and~
Venl!S in Taurus, Jupiter in Pifces, and Saturn with Mars iu Scorpio.t .
The Archbifhop of Pifa confulted fcveral different profeffors of afrrology ·
.. concerning .his deitiny, and they all calculated his nativity at different.
times, and \vithout any comn1unication vvith one another; but they all
foretold ·him .he \vould be hanged. lt feen1ed highly incredible at the
time, becaufe be \vas info much honour and povver; but the event jufrified
the predictions; for, in the {edition of Pope Sextius IV. in the fi.1dden

afterwards entreating him to marry one Caffandra Bcnna, he very rc{o-
lutcly declined it, iaying, He \vould not \vith the bands of matrimony bind

calculated his nativity, which they after\van.ls fcnt him, \Vith this pre-
diCtion inclofed, " That he vvould die in the thirty-third year of his age."
This exafperated him fo much, that he began to \vritc a ne\v traer, \vith
inconceivable afperity, againft the poor afirologers, attempting to prove
their calculations a mere bubble, and them.felves a fet of impoPrors. But
'\Vhen the fatal appointed hour arrived, he fa'v the folly of his O\Vll con-
ceits; re~(\nted his opinion, and fealed by his dc:tth a ftanding memorial
of the inerrability and truth of this fcience.f l\tJany other extaordinary
circutnfiances of the kind might be related from different authors, \Vere it
not already fufficiently obvious that the intellectual faculties of man, '\Vhen
cultiYated by fiudy, and itnproved by obfervation and experience, are ca-
pable ofattaining a very extenfive degree of knowledge and fkill in this art.
\Ve will therefore difmifs this argument, and endeavour to explain \\'hat
the fubjec1s are that the fcience of Aftrology naturally comprehends. .
Afirology is cotnpounded of ct(T1flp, ftar, and ~o~o;, dijcottrfl, and literally
implies, The doclrint ofthejlars; teaching ho\v to judge ot their effects
and fecret influences, and to foretel future events, by tbe order of their
different afpects, qualities, and pofitions; and alfo ho\V to difco\·er their
energy and force upon earthly fubfiances, in the \Vonderful and abfirufe
· operations of the nature. It conJprehends the moft excellent part of that
· noble fcicnce called Phyfiology, or Natural Philofophy, \\'hich is the doc-
trine of natural bodies in the conftruCl:ion of the vvorks of nature. The
body naturally 1nay be conceived either generally, as one perfctl and entire
body; or fpecially, as i~ tnay be diviJed into t\vo, or fitbdividcd into
~any thoufand con1ponent parts. .This grand anrl perfeet body of nature

and hence arife two difrinet fcie~1ces, th~ one. termed ' Uranolog)', and
the other· Geology. ..
Geology is a fcience treating of the natural body called the earth, and
fpeaks either generally <>fthe \V hole earth, or fpecia11y of the parts, offame
particular part thereof; and is either fpeculativ~, or praltical. Specu-
lative Geology confills in the fim1)le ir~vefiigation of the ea,rth, either
in vvhole, or in part, and of the principles and affection.~ thereof; and to
this purpofe it treats either of the common being of any earthly thing,
merely as 1t is a being abfiraB: from ·all matter, whether intelligible or '
feniibJc ; and as it operates thus; it is. termed Metaphyfical or Preter-
natural Philofophy. But, if it difcourfes of a moveable being in tnatter,
and that as it is perfeEtly tnaterial, it ~is then called Natural Philo(opby.
Or, if it fpeaks of things co~verfant in. tnatter intelligible, but not fen-.
fible, as they are the abfiraets of matter, it is named matheme1:tical or
Abfiratl Philofophy. Of this fort of fcience the fubjeB: 1s Quantity,
and is either co11tinued, or difcrete.. If of continued quantity, it is
called Geometry, or its fubordinate, PerfpeCl:ive; but, if the quantity be
difcrete, it is then termed Arithtnetic, or its fubordinate, Muftc. N a"'!
tural ·Philofophy properly fo called, treats of te(refirial bodies, either.
fin1ple or mixed. The fitnple bodies. confift of the four· elements,
called Fire, Air, Earth, and Water, \vhich occupy all places, fro1n the..,
utmoll: and inferior bodies of tl;le heavenly matter unto_the inn1oft centre
of the earth, fo that vacuu1n no where exifis under the cope of
. heaven. The mixed bodies ·are compounded ofthefe. four elements~ and
are divided into animate and inanitnate bodies. And all animate bodies
are endued either \vith a vegetive, fenfitive, or rational, faculty. No\v,
'vhile \Ve itudy the doctrine·of tQis earthly body n"tural, the fcie;nc~s of.
Geography, Hiftory, and Chronology., naturally flow from it: the fil·ft
of which defcribes the fituat1on and boundaries of the different parts of
the earth ; the fecond relates the hi(tory of \Vhatever has been.feen or •
tranfaCl:ed upon it ; and the third computes and adjufis all the different
a:ras and portions of tim~, from the creation ~f the world to the· pre-
fent hour. And _fubotdinate to thefe are Topography_, or a defcription of
particular. places, and Chronologies of certain dill:in'Cl periods of time.
Pracrical Geology is that part of Natural Philofophy \vhich confifis in
Speculation for the 1>rofit and advantage of mankind; and leaves a_ track.
or fruit of its operation retnaining, \Vhen the atr itfelf is pafi ao.d gon.e. ~~
And this is a fort of fiudy claffed under the denomination of Art, rather
than of Science. .The {ubjeB: of it muft be either Man himfelf, or fom~

Ethical Philofophy; or elfe to infiruCl hitn in the Art of Reafoning~
called J....ogical Philofophy; or in the art of Speaking, which \VC tenn
Grammatical or l{hetorical Philofophy. But, if the fpeculation be upon
nny fitbordinate fubfiancc, then the earth itfelf, or the produClions of it,
become. the fubjeet of invefiigation. lf it be the earth, then the bufi-
uefs \Ve contetrlplate is to jn1prove and cultivate the· foil, for the in-
cr~afe of ufeflll vegetation, \Vhich is called Agriculture ; but, ifIt be the
produCtions ofthe earth, then the il:udy mufr be fo to prepare and manu-
faB:urc thetn, us to render them the clfentials of Health, \Vealth, Food,
or Clothing; or whatever elfe is conducive to the comforts or ncccfii-
tics of mankind. And tqefe are feverally diftinguiil1ed by as many fiO'-
nificant terms as there are occupations or employments; by the inve~­
tion and ufe of \Vhich all thefe things are produced.
Uranology is a fcience· \vhich treats of the natural body of heaven,
after- the fame manner as geology defcribes that of the earth; and fpcaks
either generally, of the \Vhole heaven; or fpecially, of fome particular
or rlifrinCl: part of it. And, as Uranology is a part of Phyfiology, fo has
it the fan1e principles, \vhether internal, as matter and form ; or ex-
, ternal, as the caufes efficient and final ; and thefe are principles of their
o\vn nature, as chance and fortune are princjples by accident. It hath
alfo afFeCtions internal, as motion and refr, and fiuity and infinity;
and the fame external, as. tin1e and place. Uranolo~y is. alfo either
fpeculative or praCtical. Spec?lativ: Uranology ~onfiits. in th~ fimple
kno\vledge of the heavens, either Ill whole or 111 part, and of their
various principles and affeCtions; and to tbis pur.pofe it fp~aks of thefe
things either mathematically or naturally. l\1athelnatically, it treats
of afironomy, or uranometry, \vhich is a fcience that points out the
· magnitude, tnea.fure, and motion,- of the heavens, and of the frars there-
in; and naturally, · it defines_the qualities, motious, afpeEts, and opera-
tions, of the heavenly podies,. and all the. apparent and infenfible in-
fluences: PraCtical Uranology is tba~ fublime art, \vhich, being: once
perfea.Jy lulO\Vll and rightly under:frood,. enables a man, by his !kill in
t~e affeClions of the heavens and heavenly bodies, to unbofom the re-
moteft tranfaCl:ions of futurity, and to trace the myfterjous and mofr
obfcur.e operations o£ natur:e to their fource ; \vhence he defines th_
e
innate principles and v.ittues of all. anima1,-vegetable, and 1nineraJ, fub-
13:anccs, and points out their reipective ufes, for the lailing profit and

learning or ingenuity at all, are fome way or other convcrfaut in afrro-
logy, without appearing to kno\v it. But the perverfene!s of human
na~ure is in this infiance moll: :ftrikingly vifible, ilnce it leads mankind
to a choice of inferior [peculations, w hi111: they utterly neglecr an invell:i-
gation of thofe curious, ind1fcernable, infenfible, and impalpabl.e, tracks
of nature, 'vhich ~pen to a field of unbounded information, calculated to
reform the mind, and enlarge the underfianding ; and to extirpate the
feeds of atheifin, by leading to.the mofr fublime and .hetl.veply contem-
plations of a fupreme being~ The cotnmon objeB:ions againfr engaging
in this elev-
ated ftudy arc equally abfurd and ridiculous; but they pro-
ceed only frotn thofe men \Vho wilfully negleCt, or obfl:iriately perfifi in
a difuelief of, nature's fecret and imperceptible \Vorks; and yet her ope-
. rations are fo tnanifeft, and fo often confirmed by fatal experience, that
it is afionifhing tnankind are not more frequently avvakened by then1.
Thus \ve fee a man inftantaneoufly taken off by a violent and feverifu
.difretnper, and yet no one can poffibly conceive how or frolJl \Vhat caufe
it proceeds; nor can the mofi: able phyfician, by any depth of medicaltkill,
.point out its genuine caufe, fo. as to ihew that another tnan under the
fame fytnptoms !hall be feized with juft fuch another diforder. But
look into the fi~k man's nativity, by the rules of Aftrology, and there
you willtnoft apparently fee the root and caufe of his affliction: and
hence \¥e demonftrab1y prove, that it was not fo much the effect of
-catching cold, or of any accident, which brought on the malady, but
the evil influence of fome malignant afpe&, that unperceived and unfuf...
-
peB:ed gave the fatal blo\v, while a cold, or fame trifling accident, were
but mere infl:ruments; for another man fhall have a worfe cold, and
fcarcely find himfelf the leafr feveriih, or expofed to danger.
Thus we find Aftrology comprehends every operation that proceeds out
of the mafier-wheel or frame of nature, and furniihes us with a know-
ledge of the occult virtues of all earthly fubfrances, and of the nature -and
end of every particle of God's creation ; and, to minds that can reliih
enjoyments fuperior to thofe ~f fenfe, nothing can furnifh more noble
and exalted pleaiures than a contemplation and ftudy of thefe itnmenfe
\vorks; while nothing furely can give greater proofs of an abjeCl: and
contraCted n1ind, thau to be daily converfant with, and yet frupidly in-
fenfible of, the.amazing 1niracles of nature. The fun, moon, and ftars,

AN ILLUSTRATION
A SUMMARY VIEW of the WORKS of CREATION,
in the' CONSTRUCTION of NATURE.
. .
N
ATURE is that which God has ordained emprefs over all the
works of his' creation, and over every part of the celefiial and
terrefrrial world. This world comprehends both th~ heaven and the
earth, and is compounded of three feparate and 'difiintt" parts_, which
are alfo called wotlds, namely, an ekmeutary world, which is the·lo\v-
eft in dignity; a celeftial wor]d; ,vlliCfi. is next above the elementary;
and an ethereal world, ·which is the highefr of aU; and thefe.three fmaller
worlds make the·one entire great world, 0r univerfe. Jn the order of
nature, the all-,vife and fupreme Be~ng has ordained that every inferior
1hould be governed by its fuperior; and by this eternal d~cree the intel-
leCtual \vorld aCl:uates and governs the celefria1, \vhich confill:s of the fin1,
moon, and frars, and all the hofr of heaveti; and the celefiial world
atluat~s and governs the elementary wor1d, and an elementary ,bodies,
whether anima], mineral, or vegetable.
. .
~ u .
The elementary \Vorld is compofed of the four: elements, fire, air,
e.arth, and water, of which all things peculjar to the elementary wo rJd
are generated; but thefe elements, in the fiate we commonlyfind the1n, are
not pure, but inter•nixed \Vith each other; and they often change one into
the other by nature, as fire turns into fmoke, and finoke into air·, and air
into water, &c. Each of thefe elements has likewi1e t\vo fpecific qua-
lities, viz. fire is hot and dry,_water is cold and moift, air is hot and
moifr, and the earth is cold and dry ; fo that fire is inimical to \Vater,
and air to the earth. 'Thefe elements alfo poffefs three effential proper-
ties inherent in themfelves, viz. air has motion, thinnefs, and darknefs,
fire has motion, brightnefs, and thinnefs; water has motion, darknefs,
and thicknefs, and eatth hath darknefs, thicknefs, and quietnefs; fo that
:fire is twice more thin than air, thrice moFe moveable,. and four times
more bright; air is twice more bright, three titnes more thin, and four
times more moveable, than \Vater; \Vater is t\vice more bright, tnrice
more thin, and four times -more moveable, than earth; as therefore fire ·is
to air, fo is air to \Vater, and water to earth; and vice verfa, as earth is to
water, fo is water ·to air, and air to fire. Three of thefe elements have
motion, and are attive; but the earth is fixed and paifive, and only fup-
p1ies matter for the other elements to act upon; for, as nothing can be
produced unlefs matter be fubminifiered, fo of neceffity one elexnent
mufr fnbminifier that matter [Qr the operation of the others. And no
influence t:ould be difpenfed by the heavens, unlefs there 'vere elementary
bodiea
0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y. 57
bodies to receive thejr influence ; therefore every aCtive principle mufl: of
ueceflity be in motion, and every paffive principle tnufi be at refl. And
nccordingly' as the aCtive clements find the earth that they aa upon to be
pure or itnpure, fo \Vill the work be that is produced. 1~he earth can
briug forth nothing of itfelf, but is the \Vomb or matrix into \Vhich the
other c]enH:nts difiil or projcCl their feminal virtues; nud, in proportion
as it is in1prcgnated by their force and energy, h brings forth, according •
to the due courfc of nature. 'l~he earth alfo receives the celefiial rays and
influences of all the heavenly bodies, as ordained by God, to be the ob-
ject, fubjeCt, and receptacle,ofthem; whereby it not only brings forth \vhat
js intended to be produced, but alfo multiplies \V hat it receives, nnd fe-
parates the goqd from tae bad, and the pure from the impure. It li~e­
\vife contains the feed or feminal virtues of all elementary bodies, and hath
a triplicity in itfelf, viz. mineral, anitnal, and ·vcgetive. 1tis the com-
nlon fountain or mother from. whence all things 1pring, \vhofe fruitful-
nefs is produced by the three-fold operation of fire, air, and \Vater. And
as thefo eletnentary liodics polfcis moil: extraordinary qualities, it \vill be
proper to· confider each of them difl:inB:ly, and to explain their feveral
properties more at large.
Fire, the firft active element, is an elafiic body, compofed ofinfinitely
:finall particles, fcarcely, if at all, adhering to each other ; and a body
in motion. 1t is in effeCt the univerfal infi:rument of all the motion and
action in the univerfe; without fire, all bodies \vould b~come immovc•
·able, as in a fevere winter we aCl.ually fee our fluids become folid for \Vant
of it. vVithout fire a man would harden into a fiatue, and the very air
\vould cohere into a firm t:igid mafs. Fire then is the fole caufe of all
1nt1tation or change; for all mutation is by motion, and all 1notion by
fire. Upon the abfence of only a certf!in qegree of fire, all oi]s, fats,
waters, wines, ale$, fpirits of wine, vegetables, and animals, become
hard, rigid, and inert; and the lefs the deg1:ee of fire, the fooner is this
indurati~n made. Hence, ifthere vver\! the greatefr degree of cold, and
all fire was abfolutely taken a}.vny, all nature \vould ·gro\v into one con-
crete body, fo1id as gold, and hard as diamond ; but upon the re-ap-
plication of fire it \Vould recover its for1ner mobility. So that upon
this one element of fire depends all fluidity of hutnours and juices; alfo
all vegetation, putrefaCtion, fermentation, animal heat, and a thoufand
other things. Fire is in itfelf but one, though it centres in divers place~.
It centres in the l1eavens, and is boundlefs, \vherc it guards and pre-
ferves nature, and enlivens all the creatiqn, criving life, light, and mo-
tion to all crentures, and ftirs them up to fec~ndity and fruitfnlncfs. It
centres alfo in the earth, \vhere it o'enerates 1nctals, minerals, nnd fiones;
and, by joining itfelf 'vith the bea~s of the celefi:ial fun a'nd tnoon, pro-
duces

duces vegetation upon the furface of the earth. It occafions that heat
,\ve iorpeti1nes obferve in fpritigs and fountains; aad itnparts a principle
.of jts O\Vll. into \vhatever it prodt1ces; fo that v.rhatfoever· retains life
retains it hy virtue of its O\Vtl inclofed heat; and, \Vhenever this. is exhaufred
or extinguiihed, it perifhes and 'dies. And, as \~ater purgeth. cleanfeth,
and diffolveth all things that are not fixed, fo fire purgeth and perfeB:eth
all things that are fixed; and, es \Vater conjoins all things that are dif-
Jolved, io fire feparates all things that are conjoined; it caufes all feeds .
to gro\v and ripen; and, \Vhen they are ripe, it expels thetn by the fperm
into divers plac~s of the earth; and as the fituation and temperature of
thefe places are, \Vhether hot or cold, ri1oift or dry, pure or itilpure, fo
.\\'ill the diverfity of thin~s be both in the bo\vels-and upon the furface of
the earth. But, aq1ong1t all ·the wonderful properties of fire, · there are
.none tnore extraordinary-than this, that, though it is the principal caufe
of almoft all the fenfible effeCts that continually fall under our obierva-
tion, yet it is in itfelfof fo infinitely a fubtle nature, that it baffles or de-
.feats our moft fagacious enquiries, nor ever con1es \Vitbin the cognizance
,of our fenfes.
Fire may be divided ·into th_r.ee kinds or fj>ec;es, viz. celeftial, fubterra-
...raueous, and culinary. Celeftial fire is that whic4 is peculiar to the celefiial
,regions, where it exifts in the greatefl: purity and perfeCtion, unmixed
'vith fmoke, or any of that grofs, feculent, or terreftria], matter, found iu
culinary and fubterranean fire? but, allowing for this difference, the etfetls
of the celefiial fire appear to be the £'lme as thofe of the culinary. - Sub-
terra·
neous fire is that which 1uanifefis itfelfin fiery eruptions of the earth,
.volcanoes, or burning mountains, and is always found in the 1nore central
parts of the earth, and often in xnines and coal-pits. Culinary fire is that
'vhich we employ in all ch~mical operations, and in the comtnon occa~ons
of life. To afcertain the force and povver of fire, the learned Boerhaave
made innumerable curious experiments, W"hich enabled him ~o divide it
.into fix degrees. The firft degree is that by which nature performs the
office of vegetation in plants, and by which chemillry imit.a_tes and does
the like. · This commenc€s from the higbeft degr~e of cold, which in
}"'ahrenheit's thermotneter is denoted by one, and ends at eighty degrees.;
fiuce in this \vhole interval vegetables of one kind or other give indication
of life and growth; fo that, if all plants be examined by the degrees of
heat contained within thefe limits, we lhall find all of them come to ma-
_
turity in one or other of thefe intermediate degrees. This heat is fuited
to ~·extract the native fpirits of odoriferous vegetables with oils, as that
of r.ofes, jeffamin, and the like. ~,hus the fragrant fcent of rofes may be
communicated to oil, by .Putting the inodorous and iufipid oil of olives in
.a tall clean chemical glafs, and digefi:ing it in a heat of fifty-fix degre~s,
'Vtth
0 F A S T R 0 J.J 0 G Y., 59
\''ith the mofi fra~rant rofes, gathered jull as they are opening in a morn-
in(l'; the application of a iimi]ar degree of heat would alfo impregnate
al~ohol \vith the purefi fj)irit of faffron. [{'he fccond degree of fire may
be accounted that of the human body, in a healthy ftatc. This degree is
ahvays greater than -that of the ..tnhieut air, and tnay be fuppoied to
comtnence at the 4oth degree of the: thermotnctcr, and end about the
94th. Within this cotnpafs anitnab xnay live and fubfifi, that is, if their
juices be of any degree of heat \vithin thete bounds. The eggs ofinfetl:s
1ubfift unhurt during hard winters, and hatch in the fucceeding fpring.
Filhes, both of the iea and of rivers, live in \Vater \vhich is only thirty-
four degrees \Varm; and filhes that have lungs, and all rcfpiring animals
in a fiate ofhealth, communicate to their humours a \Varmth of nincty-t\\·o
degrees; and therefore,the utmoft limits of this degree are fixed at thirty-
three and ninety-four. With!n the compafs of this heat are included the
vital aCtions of animals, the fermentation of vegetables, and the putre-
faClion both of vegetaoles and animals; and like'vvife the generation,
breeding, hatching, birth, and nutrition, of animals. This· degree is alfo
employed by chemifis to prepare elixirs, volatile alkaline falts, and tinc-
tures. 1~he third degree of fire ·is that which extends from ninety-four
degrees of the thermo1neter to 212, at \Vhich lafr, \Vater ufuaH:' boils.
This degree is required in the difiillation of fitnp_le and compound \Va-
ters, the eCfential oils of vegetables; and \viii coagulate or confolidate
the ferum, blood, and otber animal juices, and coniequently dellroy life.
}:_he-fourth degree of heat may be reckoned frotn the degree 2 I 2 to 6oo;
within which limits all oils, faline lixivia-, mercury, and oil of vitriol, are
difiilled; lead and tin will alfo melt and mix together. The.oils, faits,
and i:'lponaceous juices, ofanimals and vegetables, are rendered volatile and
acrid, and become more or lefs alcale{cent; their folid parts are calcined
and lofe their difiinguifhing qualities and proper virtues; and \Vith this
degree of fire, foffil fulphur and fal (!mtnoniac are fublimed. The fifth
degree is that \Vherein the other metals n1elt, and 'vhich commences from
fix hundred degrees of the thermoraeter, and ends where iron is held in a
ftatc of fufion. In this degree moft bodies are de:ftroyed; bu.t..glafs, gold,
filver, copper, and iron, re1nain long unchanged;- all other fixed bodies
gro\v red hot in this degree, and all the unvitrifiable 11:ones are calcined.
The fixth and higheft degree of fire hitherto kno\vn, is that of the burn-
ings lens, or fpeeulu1n, by lVI. Villette, Tfchirnhaufen, Buffon, and others.
The focus of thefe lenfes \Vill even volatilize \Vhat is called the metalline
or me-rcurial part of gold, and vitrify the tnore terrefirial. The uttnofr
degree of fire is the vitrification of fixed bodies, \vhich the ancient 1nagi,
or the afirologers of the eafi, difcovered; and they predicted the final
end of the \Vorld by fire, and its mutation into tranfparent glafs.*.

6o AN ILLUSTRATION
Air is the next aCtive element that engages our attention, and it is di-
vided into proper or e/e?netttar)', and con11non or lzeteroge11eous. Elementary
air, properly fo called, is a fubtile, homogeneous, elafiic, tnatter; .the baiis
or fundamental ingredient of common air, and that \\'hich gives it the
denorpination. It like\vife enters into the cotnpofition of mofi: or perhaps
all bodies, and exifis in the1n under a folid form, deprived of its ela{:.
ticity, and moil: of its diftinguifhing properties, and ferving as the ce-
·
ment and univerfal bond of nature; but capable, by certain proce!fes,
of being difengaged from thetn, recovering its elafiicity, and refembling
the air of our atmofphere. The pecul~ar nature of this aerial matter vve
know but little of; · \\'hat authors have advanced concerning it being
chiefly cot)je.Cl:ural. \Ve have no way of altogether feparating it from the
other matter, with 'vhich, in its purefi frate, it is more or le1s co1nbined,
and.confeq;uently llO \Nay of afcertaining, Wlt~ fatisfactory evidence, its
peculiar propertie~, abfiratl:edly from thofe of other bodies.. Philofophers,
both ancient and modern, maintain, ·with great p1aufibility' that it is the -
lame with the pure ether, or that fine, fluid, active, matter, diftuied through
the whole expanfe of the celefiial regions, and .pf the interior heavens ;
and it is fttppofed to be a body Jui ge1zeris, ingenerable, incorruptible, im-
tnutable, prefent in all places and in all bodies.
Common or heterogenebtls air, is a coalition of c~rpufcles of various
kinds, \vhich together confiitute one common mafs, wherein \ve live and
move, and which we are continually receiving and expelling by refj)iration.
The whole affemblage of this makes \vhat we call the atrnofphere,· and,
l\'here this air or atmofphere ends, there the pure ether is fi.1ppofed to
commence, which is difiinguifhed from air, by its not tnaking· auy fenfi-
ble refratlion of the rays of light, as air does. This common air, h'lys
the ingenious Mr. Boyle, is the moil: heterogeneous body in the univerfe;
and Boer.haave ihews_it to be an univerfal chaos, or colluvies, of all kinds
of created bodies. Befides ' the matter of light or fire \vhich continually
flows into it from the heavenly bodies, and probably the n1agnetic effluvia
of the eatth, whatever fire can volatilize is found in the air. Hence the
\vhole foffil ~ingdom tnuft be found in it ; for all of that tribe, as falts,
fulphurs, frones,, and metals, are convertable into fume, and thus capable
of being rendered part of the air. Gold itfelf, the mofi: fixed of all na-
tural bodies, is found to adhere clofe to the fulphur in mines; and thus to
be raifed along \vith it. Sulphurs alfo tnake a coniiderable ingredient of
the air; on account of the many volcanoes, grottos, caverns, and other
fpiracles, chiefly affording that miner'll, difperied through the globe. All
parts of the animal kingdom mufi: alfo be in the air;· for, befide the co-
pious effiuv.i.a continually etnitted from their bodies, by the vital heat, in
the ordinary procefs of perfpiration, by means of vthich an animal in the
courfe

courfe of its dur:ttion, i1nprcgnates the air \vith many. titncs the quantity
of its O\\'n body; \VC find that any animal \Vhcn dead, beii1g expofed to
the air, is in a certain time '~holly incorporated \Vith it.~· As to vegcta...
Lles, none of that clafs can be wanting in the contribution of their effluvia
to the con1tnon air, fince \Ve kno\v that all vegetables, hv putrefaftion,
becorne volatile. The a!fociations, feparations, attritions, dilfolutions,
and other operations of one fort of 1nattcr upon another, may like\\'ife. be
contidered as fources of numerous other neutral or anonymous bodies, un-
known to the tnofl: inqtlifitivc uaturalifi. 1'hus air is one of the moft con-
• This faCl: is proved in a very (hiking m:1nner, by an cxtraordin:try effect produced by tho(s
dead bodies, after they became filled with air, which were unfortunately drowned in the Royal
George at Spithead, on the %9th of Augufr, 178-z. 'fhis lhip was heeled on her fide for the
purpofe of fame repair, when the water rulhed into her lower port-holes, and funk her almoft
inO:antaneoufiy. She went down in fourteen fathom water, and fdl upon her fid~, "s was evi-
dent from her cop...mafis, whkh remained above the water in an inclined direllion. A confi-
Jcrable time after this fatal accident, the fudJenly righted, and her malls became nearly perpen-
dicular. No one could account for this extraordinary tranfallion, which was effected without
any ~pparent caufe; and it remained for fome time a circumfiance equ~llly afionifuing and inex-
plicable. At length fome very able anonymous writer publifhed the following in~enious and correCt
folution of it. ·
" By the muller-roll of this unfortunate lhip, it appears tllat 495 fouls perifhed between her
u Jccks; and, as the bodies had no way to efcape, they of courfc remained in that fituation.
" Now all bodies in a fiate of putrefallion ferment, and this fermeutation generates large qu3n-
" tities of air, fo that a putrefying carcafe, inflated by the generation of air, expands icfelf to a
" fize far exceeding its original bulk, and becomes lighter than water in a very high degree; and
" will confequently be prefi"ed upwards towards the furface, with a power equal to the weight
'' of a qu:.w~ity of water adequate in bulk to th~ inflated carcafe; and would rife immediately
'' to the furface in a perpendicular line, if not oblhuacd in its palfage. Now it is obvious
'' that the 4-95 carcafes, which Jay between the decks unril fermentation and putrefacHon
'' commenced, would rife as foon as the generated air rendered them fpecifically lighter than.
" fea water: and; as fermentation increafed their bulk, they would by their expanfton, remove a
'' quantity of water from between the decks, on the lowefi: fide of the £hip (to which by their
'' gravity they would naturally incline when their breath firfi: left them) equal to their increafed bulk;
" and, being then acted upon by the upper preffure of the water, would exert againft the under-
'' part of the decks, immediately over them, a power likewife equal to fuch weight of water as
'' equals their increafed bulk. The heaviefr fide of the !hip, being thus firft lightened b'y the
'' tlifplacing fo large a quantity of water, and exchanging it for air; and then aCl:ed upon by the
" preffure of the water upwards againft the under fide of the inflated carcafes, lifting hard againft
" the decks on or beneath the centreof the fi1ip; and farther by the prelfure of the water upwards,
•' againfi the under fide of the hulls, mafts, &c. together with the counterpoife of a large weight
" of water. between decks, on the higheft fide; would caufe her to .be nearly in equil:brio;
" and conlequently, the firft !hong tide (as was the cafe) would fwang her on her keel, and
u right her. .
" To thew that 49) bloated carcafes might have power fufficient to produce fo firange a pbe-
" nomenon, Jet us tuppofe each carcaf~ at that time equal to a twenty-gallon calk, and it could
'' be no lefs, for, when in a fiate of putrefacHon, not only the abdomen and thornx, but e\·en the
" fma1Jcil veffel in the human frame, becomes inflated by the vapour generated in ferment:ltion;
" fo that the limbs fwell to the extremities,and become buoyant, which makes the efiimate of twenty
" gallons per carcafe lefs perhaps than the truth.

fiderable and univerfal agents in all nature, being concerned in the prefer-
vation .
of life and the produCtion of mofi of the phenomena relating to
this world. Its properties and effects, including a great part of the re-
fearches and difcoveries of the modern philofophers, have in confider.able
degree been reduced to precife la\VS and demonftrations; in which. form
they make a very exteniive and important branch of the mixed mathe-
tics, called Pneumatics; for a more perfeCt kno\vledge of vvhich, I beg
leave to recomtnend the curious 1·eader to Dr. Priefiley's invaluable Ex-
periments and Obfervations on different kinds of Air. But I !hall juil:
obferve further, that to the preffure of air we are to attribute the cohe-
·r'ence of the parts of oodies. Breathing too, on which depends animal
'life, is owing to the preifure and fpring o( the air; and to the fame
·caufe may be attributed the produttion of fire and flatne, as appears from
the fudden extinCtion of fire 'A'hen deprived of air. It is likewife necef..
fary for the exifience and propagation of founds,' for the germination and
growth of plants, for conveying all the variety of fmells, and for re-
ceiving aud tranfmitting the rays and intluences of the celeftial \Vorld to
the terrefirial. 1Air aCts upon all.bodies by its common properties of
weight and ~lafticity, and by the.Peculiar virtues of the ingredients \vhere-
of it is compofed. Thefe properties of \veight and elafiicity in the air,
'\Vhen engendered in large quantities in the bo,vels of the earth, and
heated by the fubterranean fire, occafion earthquakes, and other vehe-
ment commotions of nature. And by fome.late experiments of M. de la
I-Iire, it is found that a certain quantity of condenied air, .if heated to a
degree equal to that of boiling water, \vill p1·oduce an explofion fuffi-
cient to tear a!under the folid globe. By nleans of a corroding acid, air
di.ffolves iron and copper, unlefs \Vell defended by oil; even gold in the
chemifi's laboratory, when the air is impregnated with the. effluvia of aqua
regia; contraGls a rufr like other bodies. It fixes ~olatile bodies, and vo- ·
latilizes thofe \Vhich are -fixed. Frotn the different effiuvire diffufcd
through the air, proc~ed a varie.ty of effeCl:s. Near mines of copper, it
will difcolour fuver and brafs; and. in London, \vhere the air abounds
\vith acia and corrofive particles, metalline utenfils ruft 1nuch fooner than
in the coutitry. Stones alfo !llldergo the changes incident to metals.
Thus Purbeck il:one, of which Salitbury cathedral is built, is obferved
· to become gradually fo_fter, and to moulder- away in the ~ air; and 1\llr.
Boyle gives the fame account of Blackington fione. It is very difficult
· to obtain oi] of fulphur in a clear dry air, as its parts are then more re'\dy
to evaporate; but in a moift cloudy air it may be obtained in abundance.
M':All falts meltmoft readily in cloudy weather; and feparations proceed beft

vertible into ice by cold, naturally pervading the firata of the earth, and
flo\ving on its furface, and \vith the ·body of the earth, confiitutes the
terraqueous globe. The figure of the component parts of \Vater appears
to be 1inooth and fpherical, like thofe of quickfilver; \vhence it becomes-
extremely moveable and penetrating. Thus it readily enters the pores of
wood, leather, ikins, chords, apd mufical firings, and is capable of

through filtres of paper, fione, &c. and even raifes iome proportion of
them in difiillations. Its particles appear to be extre~nely minute, and
fo have a large !hare of furface. Hence \Vater is adn1irably fitted for a.

continual 9ifiillations of the ocean and rivers, raifed up by the-heat of:
the central fun, and draws, along \\'ith it" a wann unCtuous vapour, v.rhich
caufes a natural generation of whatever the earth, as a matrix,· is impreg-
tlated \vith. \Vater ahvays contains an earthy fubfi:ance, and is found in
the hardefi: bodies, and in the dricfr air. It is the proper menfiruum
of falts, and; by the readinefs \Vith 'vhich it itnbibes the different
kinds of air, is eafily rendered, by a lately-difcovered chetnical procefs, to
potTe£s the £Lme qualities and virtues as the mofi efieemed tnineral \Vaters
hitherto diicovered. "- Water is alfo as infinite ufe in all the works both
of nature and art, as without it there could be no generation, nutri~
~ion, or accretion, performed in any of the animal, vegetable, tnine-
ral, marine, or atmofpherical, regions. The blood could not flo\v in the .
veins, the fcLp in the veffels of vegetables, nor the particles of minerals
concrete and grow together, \Vithout water. It is this that makes the
largeft part of our blood, our drink, and other ali1nents. There could
be no corruption, fermentation, or dilfolution, carried on \vithout it; no
bre\ving, no difiilling, no \Vines, no vinegar, no fj1irits, made \Vithout
it.tAl vVe alfo meet with water utHler an infinite.variety of fortns and in aa
infinite variety of bodies, as th<1t of air, vapour, clouds, fi1o\v, hail, ice~ _
fap, \Vines, blood, flelh, bone, horn, frone, and other bodies, through
all \Vhich it feetn~ to pafs unaltered, as an agent or infrrument that fuf-
fers no alteration by re-aCtion, but remains capable of refiuning the fortn
of \Vater again upon any occafion. In its O\Vn cotnmou"flate, water ap-
pears to be a combination of all the elements together, as cor~taining a
qua~1tity of fire, \Vhich keeps it fluid ; a quantity of air, and a quantity
of earth; \vhence it is not at all furpr~fitig, that ,,·ater alone, as it appears
to the fenfes, fhould fuffice for vegetation in fame cafes, \vhere little
e.arth is .'vanted, br for fupporting animal and mineral life, V.'here no great
degree of nutritnent is t·equired; and hence it proves a glue or cement to
fame .bodies, and a folvent to others; thus it confolidates brick, plafrer
of Paris, fione, bone, and the like; but ditTolves ialts and fubtile earth
~roaching to ialts, and becomes ~he inftrtnnenta1 caufe of their a(tion.
f water alfo conveys nourilhment, or a more fixed and folid tnatter, to the
parts of vegetables, \vhere having depofited it, the finer fluid perfpires
into the attnofphere, '"'hich gives us the phyfical caufe ofthe dampnefs and

it at their leaves; which intimates a method of colletling \Vater in dry
countries, and likewife of lnaking h'llt \Vater fre!h. It is aUo ouferva- '
blc, that \Vater in pafling through plants, after having depofitcd its more
. terrcfirial part, docs not ahvays ·go off pure, but itnpregnated \Vith the
finer effluvia, or more fubtile particles, of the vegetables; thus making an
ntmofpherc around every plant according to its nature, odoriferous or
other\vilc, \V hich f\1 ppli~s us with a rule for procuring the odoriferous
'\Vaters of vegetables by ditlillation. But the particles, not fine enough
to go off thus along \Vith the water, are left behind upon the furface· of
the leaves and flo\vers of plants, being no\v thickened or ll:rained from
their moifier parts, and remaining in the form of hooey, manna, gums,
or balfams, according to the nature of the vegetable. And hence \ve
deduce the phyfical caufe \vhy plants prove mor_e odoriferous and f\veet
\vhen the air is both \varm and moifi, as is the cafe immediately after a
fum1ner fho\ver. vVater is likewife of the utmofi ufe in divers of
the mechanical arts and occafions of life, as in the motion of mills,

The fourth element, which is pafiive and fixed, is Earth, and confifu
of a fimple, dry, and cold, fub!l:ance; and is an ingredient in the compo-
fition of all natural-bodies. It mull: be obferved, that pure native earth
is a very different matter from the earth \vbereon \Ve tread; and this pure
earth is fuppofed to be the bafis or fi1bftratum of all bodies, and that
wherein the other principles refide. It is all that is folid in an a~1imal
or vegetable body, all the real vafcular p'lftS, the re!l: being juices. L
This
earth may be found in and feparated from all animal and ve~etable fub-
frn.uces, and is the fame in all, and is the baGs. of all. It remains after
the feparation of the other principles by chemill:ry, from all animal and
vegetable fubfiances, and neither coheres together, nor fuffers any change
in the fire. The affay~r..s._ ack'nowledge no difference bet\veen the earth
·ofanimals and vegetables, but make their tefis for the niceft ufes equally
of both. If \Vater be poured upon this earth, it acquires fome degree of
tenacity, fo ns to beco1ne capable of being fanned into velfels; but, if oil
be added, it coheres into a much fironger and more cotnpaet mafs; hence
it appears that oil and earth nre the principles \Vhich give confifience and
tenacity to plants. This oil, as \Veil as this earth, feetns the fame in aU,
aild polfetfes nothing of the poifonous or tnedicinal virtues of the plant
or \vhatever it is extracred fron1; they being all fcparablc by decoCtion,

- and thefe giving folidity and figure, preferv~ the plant in ·its fonner ap-
pearance; but thefe only ren~aining, it poffeffes. none of its virtues.
rrhis pure earth m~y be procured by drawing off the fpirit, fulphur,
phlegm, and falts of \Vine; and what remains will be a tafielefs, {cent~
lefs, dufry, matter, not capable of being raifed by diftillation, or dif-.
folved by folution, b1.1t 'vill preferve the fan1e frate and form even in the fire;
and this is called ~pure eart~, or capztt 1n:ortttunt. It tnay alfo be obtained ..
pll.re and unmix~d from the common clafs of vege~ables and oth.er bodies?
by letting the remait~ing mafs, after difiillation, be ·thoro;ugh1y calcined;
then boiled in feveral \Vaters to get out all its fait, and aft~r this dried
it~ a clear fite, or in toe f"Gn; and this dried mafs \tvill be pure +earth..
Thus, from the different qualities and operations of the four elements
\lpon one another, vve may obferve, that the fire preferves the earth
from being overwhehned or deftroyed by water; the air preferves the fire,
that it ~e. not extinguifhed ; and the \Vater preferves the earth, that it be ·
n..ot burnt; but, if either of thefe aB:ive eletnents were to become predo-
minant in auy great degree, the world 'votlld be defi:royed; as \Vas t4e
cafe at the time ofthe deluge, by the predorninaney of \Vater.

Of thefe four elements the whole terrefirial world is compofed, \vith
all its produCtions and appendages; and over thefe Man hath the do-
minion, as God's vicegerent upon earth, being compounded of the 1nofr,
perfe¢1 and noble part of earthly matter, and fonned after God's O\Vll
image and· likenefs. Hence 1\1an is called the Microcofm, frotn /Mxp~,
lit'tle and xoerp.~, world, literally fignifying, the little 'l.Vorld,~ \vhich is ap-
plied to Man, by w~y of ernineuce, as being an epitome of all that is ex-
cellent and \Vonderful il1 Nature. If \Ve attentively confider the fi:ruB:ure
and faculties of man, \Ve fhall clearly perceive his exiflence upon earth,
jn a charatl:er (ubord.inate to that of angels, is only intended by the Deity
for a fiate of probation; and as this corporeal life 1hall terminate, either
in aCl:s of piety, or profanenefs, fo :lhall follow the retributions of an im-
partial and ju:ll: Judge, in a future fiate of everlafting duration. Man is
compofed of three difiinB: effences, Spjrit, Soul, and body; as ·St. Paul
evinces when he fays, ·Let your Spirits, Souls, and Bodies, be kept blanze-
lifs a~ the canting of the Lord Jefus Chrifl. And thefe .~hree effences are .
., compounded ofthe three fmaller worlds; the Soul of Man is formed of the
ethereal world; the Spirit, of the celefiial \Vorld; and the Body, of the
elementary world. Hence is deducible the influences of the fun, moon~

and t1ars upon !\1an's body, becaufe he hath a microcofmical fun, moon,
and fiars, \vithin hitnfclf, that bear a fympathy \Vith the cclellial bodies,
and in the centre of \\'hich {hines the divine Spirit. For the fenfual ce-
lcfiial part of tnan, is that \vhcrcby we move, fee, feel, tafte, and fmeJJ,
and haye a cotnmcrcc \Vith all tnaterial objeCts; and through thcfe the
influences of the divine nature arc conveyed to the more refined and
fcniible organs. 'fhis celcfiial fpirit aCtuates and influences ~he el.emen-
tary cffcnce, and fiirs it up to the propagation of its like, and to every other
purpofe for \vhich nature defigned it. And this fpirit is even difcoverable
in herbs and flo,vers, 'vhich open \Vhen the fun rifes, and clo1e \vhcn he
fets; \vhich n1otion is produced by the fpirit being fenfible of the approach
and departure of the fun's influence. NcJ!! to thefe, in man, !hines that
]lUre, ethereal, angelic part, called therational foul; \Vhich is a di\·illC
light or frrean1 flo\ving immediately from the Great Creator, uniting
tnan 'vith God, and raifing him above all other parts of animated na-
ture. This foul, "'hen once it enters the. body, runs parallel \vith
eternity; and joins in \Vitb the celefiial fpirit, through the fpherc of the
planets; and is conduCl:ed by divine genii to an hypofiatical union
with the elementary body; fo that there exift t\VO aCtive priuciplcs in
the body of 1nan, to one paffive; a·nd, as the Superior H.ulers in the celef-
.tial,,vorld are fituated at the time of man' nativity, fo "·ill his confii- ,
tu tion and difpofition be framed. And here \ve derive the caufe of all
thofe afioni!hing Yariations of temper, difpofition, and confiitution, \\'hich
are not only peculiar to ~ifferent iubjecl:s, but even to one and the fatne
perfon; for every one \vill bear a tefiitnony of this faCt, that \Ve find our-
fclves fotnetitnes cheerful, and at other tin1es n1elancholy, to-day in perfect
health, and to-morro\V in pain and angtli(h; this hour compofed, atfa-
ble, and complacent, and the next aufiere, pettllant, and peremptory;
and thefe contrarieties are evidently produced by the continual refil!ance
and ~ppofition of the four eletnents in man's body, \\'hich alternately dif-
po1e him to the various affeet·ions difcoverable in htunan nature. 'rhe
caufe of this is deduced frotn the natur;tl en1nity of the elementary mat-
ter, viz. heat and cold, drynefs and moifiure; each of \V hich occa...
fionalJy pred0minates iu man's body, according to the tnotion and influ...
ence of thofc heavenly bodies, that rule, govern, and modify. the operation
of the four clements, in and upon every terrefirial i\.Jbfl:auce. 1"'hu~ it is
evident, that the undcrfianding and intellecrual faculties of man are fann-
ed ofthe ethereal \Vorld; the fenfitive po\vers of life and atlion are derivtd
frotn the celefiial \\'orld ; and the groiS and corruptible part, the flel11 and
blood, coufifis of the elementary \\'orld; \Vhich are all fubordinatc the

68 AN ILLU,STRATION ..
. 'Sceptical and atheifiical 'vriters; indeed, have attempted to overtt~rn this
fyfl:etn of nature in the coufirucrion of n1an, by denying the immortality
of the foul, and a future diftribution of re\vards and puni!htnents; con...
~ending that the foul is an indivifi.ble part of the body, and has its diffo-.
l11tion in the cqmmon courfe of mortality. But thefe tenets are fo ex- .
tremely abfurd, fo vag\)e,' and fo defiitute of evidence, that the rational
mit1d is at a lofs to conceive how f\.1ch an inconfifieut doctri1le could ha\·C
ever been broached; for, the fame philofophical reafoniug that enables us
to define the nature ~nd exifience of the body, v:,in like\vife prove the
nat\ue and exifience of the foul. I.t is only from the primary or elfential
qualities of body, its extenfion, and folidity, that \ve forn1 any ~dea ·of
-it; and \Vhy may \Ve llOt fonn the COU1plex idea of a f6ul Or fpirit, frotn
the operations of thinking, ttnderfianding, vvilling, and the like, which
are experiments in ourfelves? This idea of an in1materia.l fubfiance, js aS·
clear as that ~re have of a material one; for, though the lH>tion of imtna-- ,
terial iubfiances may be attended 'vith difficulties, we have no tnore
reafon to deuy or doubt of its truth, than '\Ve have to deny or doubt
of the exiftence of the body. That the foul is an immaterial fob-
france, appears from hence-that the primary operations of willing and
thinking, are not only unconneCted vvith the kno\vn properties of body;
J but fee1n plainly inconfiftent '\Vith fome of its n1oft effential qualities.
For the mind. not only difcovers no relation bet\veen thinking· and the·
motion and arrangement of parts, qut it like\vife perceives, that confciouf~
~efs, a fimple act, can never proce~d from a compounded fubfiance ca.;.
pable of being divided into many parts. To illu~rate this, Jet us only
fuppofe: a fyil:em of tnatter endowed '\Vith thought; then, either all the
parts of whicl1 this fyfrem confifi:s mufr think!' \vhich 'vould tnake it
not one, but a multitude of difiinet confcious beings; or its power of
thinking mufi arife fro1n the conuetlion of the parts one \vith another, .
their motion,' and difpo1ition, \vbich, all taken together, contribute to the _
prod uCl:ion ofthought. But it is evident, ,that the motion of part~, and -
the manner of combining them, can produce nothing but an artful firuc-
tu re, and various modes of motion. Hence all m·achines, however art-
. f1.1}ly their parts are put together, and ho\¥ever cotnplicated their frruc- -
ture, though \Ve conceiYe innun1erabJe diff~rent motions, varioufiy COm- '
bined, and running ·one into another \Vith an endlefs variety,. yet ne-
ver produce any thing but figure and motion. If a <;lock, or watch, tells
the hour and minute' of the day, it is only by the tnotion of the different
hands, pointing iucceffively ·at the di,fferent figures tnarked upon the
hour-plate for th.at purpofe. \Ve never itnagine this to be ~ffetl of
thought or intelligence~ nor concei've it .poffible, by any refinement of
firueture, fo to improve the compofition, as that it ihall become capable
of kno\vledge and con(cioufi1cfs; and the reafon is plainly this, that
tho·ught
I
'
0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.
thought bt;itlg fotncthing nltogcthcr different from motion and fi!lllre,
,vithout the leafi' cbnncclion bct\veen them, it can never be fuppofcd to
refult fro1n thctn. 'I'his then being cvidcnt, that intelligence cannot
arife from an union or combination of unintelligent parts; if \ve fuppofe
it to belong to any fyO:cm of Inattcr, \Vt mu!l: n.eceffarily attribute it to
all the parts of \vhich that fyfictn is compofed; \Vhercby, infiead of one,
've {hall, as \\'as before obfcrvc9, have a multitude of diftinet confcious ,
beings. And bccaufc tna tter, how far foevcr \Ve purfue the :ninutenefs
of its parts, is fiill capable of repeated divifions, even to infinity, it is
plain that this abi\.trdity \vill folio"' us through -all the fuppofitions that
make thought inl1ercnt in a 1natcrial fubfiance. \Vhcrefore, as coufci- ~
oufnefs is incon1patible \vith the cohefion of folid feparable parts, \Ve arc
·uecefiarily led to place it in fame other fubfiance of difl:incl nature and
properties-and this fubttance \Ve call jpzrit, \\'hich is altogether difiinB:
from body, nay, and comtnonly placed in oppofition to it; for v;hich
reafon, the beings of this clafs are called irnmaterial; a \Vord that im-
plies nothing of their true nature, but tnerely denotes its contrariety to
that of matter, or material fubfiances•
.
As to the immortality of the hutnan foul; the nrgutnents to proYe it
may be reduced to the follo\ving heads: Firfi, The nature of the foul
itfelf, its defires, fenfe of moral good and evil, and gradual increafe of
kno,vledge and perfeCtion; and fecoudly, The moral attributes of God.
Under the former of thefe confideratious, it is apparent that the foul, be-
ing an immaterial intelligent fubfrance, (\S has been already proved, does
not depend upon the body for its exifience; and therefore tnay, and ab-
folutely tnufi, exifl: after the body, unlefs annihilated by the fame po\ver
which gave it a being at firfr, vvhich is not to be il.1ppofed, fince there arc
no infiances of annihilation in nature. This argutnent, efjJecially if the
infinite capacity of the fonl, its firong defire after _
in1morrality, its ra-
tional activity and advancement tov;ards perfection, be li_ke,vifeconfidered,
'vill appear perfectly conclufive to tnen of a philofophical turn; becau{c
nature, or rather the God of nature, does nothing in vain. But argu-
ments dra\vn from the moral. attributes of the Deity are not only better
adapted to convince tnen unacquainted vvith abfrraCl: reafoning, but equally
certain and conclufive \Vith the former; for, as the jufl:ice of God can
never fuffer the \vicked to efcape unpunifhed, nor the good to rernain
al\vays \lre\varded; therefore argumeuts \dravvn frorn the manifefi and
continual profperity of the \Vicked, and the frequent misfortunes and un-
happinefs of good and virt~1ous tnen, jn this life, muO: convince every
thinking perfou, thnt there is a future fiate \¥herein all ,vill be f.:t right,
and God's attributes of \vifdom, goodnefs, and jufiice, fully vindicated.
I-Iad the religious and confcieqtious part of tnankind no hopes of a future
ftate, they \Vould be of all men the moft mifcrable; but, as this is abfo-
lutely

A N 'I L L U S T .R A T I 0 N
lute1y inconfifrent with the moral charaCter of the Deity, the certainty
of' fuch a frate is clear to a demonftration.
Thus far \Ve have confidered the elementary world, which is the lo,vefl:
in dignity; and n1an, the chief fubjeB. thereof~ The celeftial \Yorld,
\vhich is next in etninence, is conftituted of a body ·datural, moft fimple,
fpherica1, clear, fluid, and n1oving confiantly in a circle, and this by virtue
of an innate po'\ver ahvays \vithin itfelf; comprehendjng and .containing
the .fi1n, moon, plane'ts, and fiars, fixed in difiinet orbs by the great Ar-
chitect of Nature, and bearing fytnpathy vvith all terrefirial fubftances, as
being forn1ed out of the fame chaotic mafs at the beginning of the \JVorld.
This celeft:ial heaven is ·~vhat l\1ofes .calls the jir1na11zent., \vhich \Vas
the \vork of the fecobd day's creation, and Jiterally .fignifies an .~xpanft
of extet!Jion; a term \Veil adapted by the prophet to· the- impreffion
which the heavens tnake on our fenfes; 'vhence, in· other parts· of the
Scripture~, the .heaven is cotnpared to a curtain, or a te~t, frre~ched o·ut to
d\vell in. Through the meditun of this celefl:ial world, and the ~eavenly
bodies thereih contained, the fupretne Being rules, governs;aud aCluates,
the elen~entary \vorld; and this js apparent, becaufe that thing whic:h vve

\Vith the heavenly bodies, by the revolutions of \vhich even time itfelf
is .tneafurcd out and djvided, fo \Ve find the c.ele_flial influences produce
all the variations of heat and cold, drynefs and moifture, generation and

Sir Ifaac Nevvton confiders and defines God, not as is ufually done,
from his perfeCfion, his nature, exifience, or· the. like; bt:tt from his
don~inion . The \vord Gon, according to him, is a relative term, and
". has a regard to fervants; it is true it denotc:s a Being eternal, infinite, and
abfolutely perfect; but a Being, ho\vever eternal, in"finite, and abfolute-
ly perfeCt, \vithout dominion, vvoitld not be God. -
The fan1e author
oo(erves, that the \VO~d God frequently lignifies Lord; but every lord is
n·ot God ; it is the dominion of a fpiritual being or lord, that confiitute•
God; true dominion, true GOer; ~ fupreme, the fupreme; feigned, the
falfe god. From fuch true dominion it follo\VS, that the true God is
living, intelligent, and po\verful; and, from his other perfeCl:ions, that
lie. is fupreme,. or fupremely perfect; he is eternal, and infinite.; om..
nipotent, and omnifcient; that. is, ·he endures from eternity to eternity,
arid is prefent from infinity to jnfinity. He governs all things that exifi,
and knO\VS all things that are tO be knO\Vn; he is not eternity, nor infi-
nity, but eternal and infinite; he "is not duration or fpace, but he en-. ·
dures, anq is prefent; he endures 'al\vays, and is prefent every \vhere;
and by exifiing al\vays, and every where, he conftitutes the very thing,
duration and fpace, eternity-- and infinity. l-Ie is omniprefent, not only
virtually, but alfo fubftantially; for po\ver \vithout fubfiance cannot fub.-
1ifr. All things are contained and tnove in hhn, but \Vithout any mutual
paffion; he fuffers nothing from the tnotions of bodies ; nor do they Ull· ... ·
de_m~~efi!lance from his orriniprefc:nce. It is confef[ed that God ex- ·
iils nTcearily; .and by . the fame neceffity he exifis al\vays, and every
where. Hence,_alfo, he n1uft be perfectly fin1ilar; all eye, all ear, all
brain, ~11 arm, all ~he po\vcr of perceiving, underfianding, and acting; but
after a manner not at all corporeal, after a manner not like that of .men,
after a manner \Vholly to us unkno\vn. He is deftitute of all body, and
all bodily fhape; and therefore cannot be feen, heard, or touched; nor
ought to be wor!hipped under the reprefentation of any thing .corporeal. '
~~e ha'Ve ideas of the attributes of God, but do not kno\V the fubftance
even of any thing; we fee only the figures and colout:s of bodies, hear only
founds, . touch .,only the out\vard furfaces, fn1ell only odours, and. tafre
tafies; but do not~ cannot, by any Jenfe. or any. reflex act, know their
in"vard fubflances; and mu~h lefs can \ve have any notion of the fub-
:fiance of God. \Ve know him by his properties and attributes; by the
Inofi \Vife and excellent ~ruCture of things, and by final caufes; but·\Ve ,
adore and 'voriliip him only on account of his dominion; for God, fet- ,
ting afid\! do·n1inion, provident:e, and final caufes, is nothing ell.e but fate .
and nature.*

he is fo eminently difiinguifhcd, by a fcries of propofitions, mutually con-
neCl:cd and dependent, an~i forming a complete :tnd_unanf\\'erablc argu-
n1cnt in proof of the attributes of the Deity. Something, he fays, has
exified fron1 all eternity ; for, fincc fomcthing now is, fomething ahvays
\Vas: other\Vife the things that no\v are tnufi have been produce~ out of
uothing, abfolutely and \Vithout caufc, \vhich is a plain contradict ion in
terms. 1·herc 11lllil have exillcd from all eternity fomc one unchangeable
and independent Being; or elfe, there hns been an infinite fucceffion of
changeable and dependent beings, produced one frorn another in an endlefs
.progreffion, \vithout any original caufc at all. For otherwifc this feries of
beings can have no caufe of its cxifience, becaufe it includes all things that
are or ever \Vcrc in the univerfe; nor is any one being in this infinite fuc-
ceffion felf-exitlent or necefT:1ry, and therefore it can have no reafon of its
exHl:ence \Vithi~l itfelf; and it \Vas equally poffible, that from eternity
,there fhould never have exified any thing at all, as that a fucceffion of fitch
beings fuould liave exified fro.m eternity. Confequently their exiftencc
.is determined by nothing; neither by any nccefiity in their O\Vn nature,
becaufe none of the1n are felf-exifient ; nor by any other being, becaufe
no other is fuppoied to cxifi.-1'he unchangeable and independent Being,
\vhich has exified frotn eternity, without any external caufe of its cxif..
tence, n1ufl- be felf-exHl:ent ; it mull exifi by an abfolute neccffity origi-
nally in the nature of the thing itfelf, and antecedent in the natural order
of our ideas to our fuppofition of its being. For \vhatcver exifts, n1uft
either come into being \Vithout a caufe; or it mufl: have been produced
by fome external caufe; or it mull: be ft;lf-exifient: but the t\VO former
fuppofitions are contrary to the tw~ firft propofitions. From this ]ail:
propolition it foll6\vs, that the only true idea of a felf exi!l:ent or necef-
farily exifiing being, is the idea of a being, the fuppofition of \Vhofe non- ~·
exift~nce is an exprefs cont~adielion ; and this idea is that of a moft fimpJe
being, ·asfoluteJy eternal and infinite, original and independent. It fol-
lo\vs alfo, that nothing/is fo certain as the exi(lence of a fupretne inde-
pendent caufe; and likewffe, that the material \Vorld cannot poffibly b'e
the firft and original being, uncreated, independent, and of itfelf eten1al;
be.caufe it does not exifi by an abfolute neceffity in ·its O\Vn nature, ,fo as
that it mufi be an exprefs contradidion to fuppofe it not to exifl. \Vith
rctyect: both to its fornl and tnatter, the material \vor.Jd may be conceived
'not to be, or to be in any refpeCl: different frotn \Vhat it is. \Vithont a COn-
tradiction, ,.fhe fubfrancc or e!fence of the f~]f..exifient Being is abfo..
Jutcly incomprehenfible by us; neverthelefs, many of the efiential attri-
butes of his nature are firittly den1onfirable, as \vell as _his exiflence.- ·
The felf-exiil:ent Being, having no cp.ufe of its exiflence but the abfolute '
neceffity of its own nature, muft of nece~ty have exified from evcrla.{r-
ing, \Vithout beginning; and muft of neceffity-exill to everlafting, 'vith-

- To this fllOre abfirufc argumc..nt, apriori, for the cxi!lencc of G:Jd, \VC
may add another, mor~ generally obvious, and carrying irre'lifiible con,..
vietion, \vhich is deduced fro1n the frame of the \vorld, and from the
traces of evident contrivance and fitnefs of things for one another, that
o~cur through all the parts of it. Thcfe.confpire to prove, that the nln-

The b~autiful, harmonious~ and beneficial, arrangement of the v~rious' bo-

fcrvicncy; the regularity of ~heir nlotions. and the aptitude of thefc mo-
tions for producing. the tnofl: beneficial effects, and n1any other pheno-
mena refulting from their relation, magnitude, iituation, and ufe, afford
~1nqueilionable evidences of the creating power and 'vife difpofal of an in..
telligent ang ~}mighty agent. rfhe po\Ver of gravity, by \Vhich the CC-
Jefl:ia} bodies perfevcre in their .revQlutions, defcrves our particular confi..
deration. This po\ver penetrates to the centres of the fun and planets,
\vithout any diminution- of its v_~rtqe, and is extended to immenfc dif....
tances, regularly decreafing, and producing the moft fenfib1e and in1por-
tant effecrs. Its action is proportional to· the quantity of folid tnatter in
bodies, and not to their furfaces, a~ is ttfual in. mechanical caufes; and,
th~.reforc, fee.ms to furp~fs· mere mechanifm. But ho\vever various the
phenomena that depend on this, po\vcr, and n1ay be exp1ai.ned by it, no
~cchanical principles can account for its effects; much lefs could it have
p~duced., at th~ beginning, .the regular fituation of the orbs, and tbe pre-
fcnt difpofition of things. Gravity could not have de~ermined the planets
to mov~ from \vefi to ~aO:, in orbits nearly circu1ar, aln1oft in the fan1e

riety of their dire¢tions. If we fuppofc the n1atter of the fyften1 to be
accutnula~cd in the centre by its gravity, no n1echanical principles, \Vith
the affiftance of this po,ver, could feparate the .huge and un,vieldy n1afs

it to have been before the creation of our world, or even from eternity ;

and duration of angels, we may neverthelefs conclude, that, though they
are of an order highly fuperior to 'that of men, yet are they not complete
and perfea; for had · they been created thus originally, they could not
have fallen, as Lucifer did, nor have finned, which the fcriptures inform
us fome of them·did by rebe1ling againft the Altnighty, and in contending
\Vith hi1n for fupretne authority. For this reafon, as they are themfch'es

'of all things, \vruch produced ~ the four elements, and all creatures that
inhabit them, by the agency of a particular fpirit called Raziel, \vlio \Vas

·Holy Spirit, \vhofe divine light is received by the angel Sabbatl.

comtnunicated from him...through the_fpherc of Saturn. 'fhis is the prin-
cipiutn generationis, .the beginning of the \vays of God, or the rnanifefl:a-
tion of~ the Father and the Son's light in the fupernatu~al gencratiot1.
And from hence fiovv do"vn all Jiving fouls, entering the inanimate body,
and giving form to unfettled matter. The fourth is 'm, El, through the

falhioneth the images of all bodies, befio\ving clemency, benevolence,
and juflice, on all. The fifth is .·ri;~, Elohi, the upholder of the fword _
and left-hand of God, \vliofe influence penetrates the angel Geburah, and
thence defcends through the fphere of Mars, giving fortitude in war and
affiietion. The fixth is n,x~s-, ?Jebaoth, 'vho befio\veth his mighty
power through the angel Raphael into the fphere of the fun, giving mo..
tion, heat, and brjghtnefs, to it, and thence producing metals. 'lhe fe-
venth is i.,.;.v. Elion, who rules the angel Michae1, arid defcends through
the fphere of Mercury, giving benignity, ·motion, and intelligence, \Vith
elegance and confonance of·fpeech. The eightp is 'li"'~, Adonai, \Vhofe
influence is received by the angel 1-Ianiel, and con1municated through the
fphere of Venus, giving zeal, fervency, aod righteoufnefs of heart, and
producing vegetables. The ninth is ,.,ll., Shaddai, \vbofe influence is con-

I'r was formerly a fubjeCl: of difpute an16ng Philofophers, -,vhethet -the
Earth or the Sun was the centre of 'the ce]eflial fyfiem; but the latter
opinion has been generally rec~ived fince the tin1e of Cop.
ernicus, \vho about
th~ year rs43 publHhed bis fir: 'books De Orbinn1 Creleftium l{evolu-
tiorlibus; wherein h~ proves the Su11 to be very ncar the cehtr,e of gravity of
the whole fyfl:em1 an-d in the con1rtion focuG of every one of the planetarr
orbits. 'Next the Sun, Mertui·y performs his revo1utioJ1 around hirh;
n·ex.t to Mercury is the orbit of Venus; and next to Venus, our Earth,
with its attendant ot fetondary the I\1oon, pcrforn1· a joint courfe, and by
their revolution nieafure out the annual period. Next to the Earth is
Mars, the firfr ~f the fup·erior platiets; ~next to him is Jupiter, and Jafi:
of all ·saturn·. Thefe and the cornets are the confiituen~ parts of the
Copernica~ or folar (yfleth, \vhich is no"'· received and approved as th~
only true o11e. betatife n1oft agreeable to the tenor of nature in all her ac-
tions; for by the t\vo n1otions of the Eax:th, all the' phenomena of the
·hea\·ens are·rcfolved, "~·hich by other hypothcfts at~e inexplicable, \vithout
a great number of other ft?Otiohs Co"t1trary l:o philo1ophical tea!oninri. It
is alfo rriore rational to fuppofe tha.t the Earth n1oves round the ·Sun; than
that the huge ~odies of th'e planets, the fiupettdous body or~he Sun, and
the iri1menfe finnament of fiars, fho\.lld all n1ove round the ~a1 th~ eYery
twent)'...four hours. 'fhe harn1ony \vhich runs through tbe folar fyi1~n1.
wohderfully confirms this hyp'othefis, viz. •that the motions of all the
planets, both p,rin1ary and fecondary, are governed and regulated Ly one
and t.he fan1e law, 'vhich is, that the fquares of .the periodical tin1es of
the prin1ary planets, are to~ each other as the cubes of their diftances from
the Sun; and like\vife the fquares of the periodical titnes of the fecondary
of any prin1ary are to each other, as the cubes of their difiances from
that pritnary. No\v the M.oon, 'vhich in the Copernican fyfien1 is a fe-
condary of the Earth, in the other liypothefis is confidered as a primatr
one ; and fo the rule cannot take place, becaufe the periodical tin1e fiated
as thaf of a primary ,one does not agree therewith. But this nngie confi..
deration is fufficient to efiabli{h the tnotion of the earth for ever; viz. if
the Earth does not n1ove..round the Sun, the Sun rnuft. 1nove, vvith the
Moon, rouud the -Earth. No\v the difiance-of the Sun to that of the
Moon being as 1o,ooo to 46, and the Moon's period being lefs than t\ven-
ty-eight days, the Sun's period \vould be found oo lefs than two hundred

fy1lcni, it tntt!l: of courfc. be placed in the centre, in order thitt the planets
rnay at all rimes have it in nn uniform and equable tnanner. For, if the Earth
bl! fuppofed in the centre, and the Sun and planets rc\'oh·e about it, th~
})lancts \\'ould then, ]ike the comets, be fcu~ched \Vith heat \vhcn ne~rcft
the Sun, and frozen \vith cold in their aphelia, or greatcfi diHancc~ \vhich
is not to be iin3gincd. llut, if the Sun be fuppofcd in the centre of the fyf-
tcn1, \\'C then have the rational hypothelis of the planets being all moved
round the Sun. by the univerl:1lla\v or po\vcr of gravity arifing from his
vafi body, and every thing ,\viU anf,vcr .to the lavvs of circular motion
and central forces; but other\vife \\'C are vvholly in the dark, and kno\v
---....- not hovv to define the~ operations of nature. Fortunately. ho"vevcr, \Ve
are able to give not only reaforrs, but demonfirable proofs, that the Sun
doe ooffcfs the centre of the f}~ftcn1, and that the planets move ahotlt
him 111 the order above mentioned. Th~ firfi is, that Mercury and \Tc...
.... nus arc ever obferved to have t\vo conjunctions \vith the Sun, but no op-
polition, \vhich could not happen unlefs the orbits of thefc planets lay
\\'ithin the orbit. of the Earth. 'I'he fecond is, that Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn, have each their conjunctions and oppolitions to·the Sun alternately
and fucce!lively, \Vhich could not be, unlefs their orbits were exterior to
that of the Earth. In the third place, the greatef.l elongation or difiance
of Iv1crcury from the Sun is obout t\venty degrees, and that of \'cnus
forty-fevcn degrees·; \vhich anf\vers exactly to their difiance in this fyf-
tem, but in the other they would be· feen one hundred and eighty de-
grees from the Sun in oppofition to hin1. Fourthly, in this difpofition
of the planets they \Viii all of them be fometimes much nearer to the Earth
than at others; the confequence of 'vhich is, that their brightnefs ~nd
fplendour, and alfo their apparent diameters, 1Nill be proportionally great-
er at one time than another; and this \Ve obfcrvc to be true every day.
'fhus the apparent diameter of Venus, \vhen greatefi, is. near fixty-fix
fcconds, but, \vhen ]eafi, not more than nine and a half; of Mars, \vhen
greateft, it is twenty-one feconds, but, \vhen lcafi, no more than t\YO (e..
·conds and a half; 'vhereas, by the other hypotheGs, they ought ahvays
to be equal. 'rhe fifth is, that, \vhen the planets are vic\ved \Vith a good
•telefcope, they appear \Vith different phafes, or \vith different parts of
.their bodies enlightened. Thus Velius is fometin1es nc\v, then l1orncd,
and after\vards dichoton1ized, then gibbous, after,vards full, and fo in-
·creafes and decre:tfes her light in the fame. manner as the Moon, and as
this fyfiem requires. 'fhe fixth proof is, that the planets, nll of them,
do fometimes appear direCt in motion, fometimes retrograde, .and at other
times fiat!onary. 'l'hus Venus, as fl1c paffes from her greatefi clong:.uion
\VCfi\vard to her grcatefi elongation ea!l:\vard, \Vill appear direct in mo-
tion, but retrograde as the patfes fro1n the latter to rhe forn1er; and,
\vhen !he is in thofe points of greate!l di!l:ance from the Sun, ihe feems

for fome time -ftationary; all \vhich is nece!fary upon the Gopernican by..
pothefis, but eannot happen-in -
t\ny other. '"fhe feventh is, that the bo..
dies , of Mercury and Venus, in their lo\ver conjunctions 'vith the Sun,
are hid behind the Sun's body, and in the upper conjunctions <tre feen. to
pafs over the Sun's body, or di{k, in form of a blaek round fpo~, \Vhich
is nece!fary in the C.opernican fy ftem, but impofiible in; any other. The
'eighth is, that the tin1e;s in-\vhich thefe conjunctions, oppofitions, ftations,
and retrogradations, of the planets, happen, are not fuch as they '\vould
be if the Earth were at refl: in its o.rbit, but precifcly fuch as \Vould hap-
pen \Vere the earth to move.round the Sun, and all· t~e other planets in
the periods affigned them; and therefore this, and no} other, can be the
true fyfiem of the vv.orld.. .~ · ·
But the better to·determine the places of the celeftial bodies, and to
underfland the confl:itution of the heavens n1ore clearly, afironomers have ,.
conceived ot· defcribed fevcral circles, called the circles of the fphere, by
'vhich the celeftial \vorld is divided and meafurcd out. Some of thcfe
are called great circles, as the equinoctial, ecliptic, -meridian, ·&c. and
others fn1all circles-, as the tropics. pe1ra1lels, &c., This equ.inoeti;-\J line
is a circle \Vhich we in1agine to inveft the \vhole \vorld,. and is fo called,
becaufe \Vhenevcr the Sun, in his progrefs. through the ecliptic, cornes to
this circle, it makes. equal days and. nights all rcu.nd the globe, as he
then rifts due eaft, and fets du.c ·\v·ca, \vhich he never does at any other
time o.f the year. 'This equinvCl:iallin.e ·is conceived to be three hundrc-.~
and fixty degrees. in its ~vhole circutnference; and each of thcfe degrees
are divided into fe<ty tninu.te3, ·or 1i:xty equal parts of a d~gree, and thefe
again into as many fecoods. ,.fhe n1eridian is another great circle,

con-
f1il.ing al fo of three hundred and fixty degrees, extending from one polar
point to the other, and t\v,ice, cutting the eqttino.

thod in \vhich t~ey divided the courfe of tl-ie ·fun in twelve equal portions
or collections of :{birs, \vhich are called ~tfierifms or confiel1~1tions. Our
afironorners took a coup!e of brafs open.vefTels~ •the one. pierced at the

fun has i·ts annual courfe, the rifing of a fiar, remarkable either for its
tnagnitude or brightnefs; and, at the critic~! inftant it appeared on the ho-
rizon, they began to let the water .flo\v. out of the upper veifel' into the
other during the refi of the night, and· the \Vhole follovving day, to the

-The \Vater, \Vhich had fJov.red during· thar time,-might then afford them
a means of tneafuring the duration of one \Vhole revolution of the heaven,
an~ of dividing that duration into feveral equal portions; fince, by·dividjng

AH thefc preparations being ready, they, the next night, obfer.vcd that

the Sun, the !\loon, and the pL111cts, took their c:ourfes, and fl:aid for the

h~ps, gave that nan1c to fon1e ftars diflerent fron1 thofe \Vhich \Vent by it

ftant Aries appeared, and·they iinv the firfi fiar of it afcending, they let
the \Vater run into the little n1cafure. As foon as it \vas full, they rc-
·1novcd it~ and thrc\V the \Vater out. In the mean time they put the other

mon1cnt the n1eafure \vas jufl: full : fo that, by giving the t\\'O little \'effels
the ti1ne neceffitry to be alternately filled to the brim three titncs each
during thc.night, they had, by that means, one half. of the courfe of the
fun jn the heaven, that is, one half of the heaven itfelf; and that hJlf
again \\'as divided into fix equal portions, of \Vhich they might fl1e\V and
diHingui!h the b~ginnirig, the .m!ddle, and the end, by fra(s, \vhich, fro1n

runs over therein, they \Vere forced to defer the obfervation of them to

By n p'~rticu1ar care of Pro,iidence, the dams of the ftock con11nonly
happen to be pregnant about the end of autumn; they bring forth during
the ~vinter and·in the beginning of the fpring; \vhence it happens that·the
young ones are kept \vann under the mother during the cold, and after-
\Vards eafi)y tbrivc and gro\V aCtive at the return of the heat. 1·hc lambs
con~e 1he firfr, ·the calves follow them, ~nd the kids fall the laft. -By this
means t!1c Iambs, gro\Vn vigorous and ftrong, n1ay follow the ram to the
fields, as the fine · days con1e on. Soon after the calves, and at laft the
kids, venture abroad1 and, by incre~fing the flock, begin to augment the
1evenues of tl1eir mailer. ..
Our ancient obfervers, feeing that there- 'vere during the fpring no
productions n1ore ufeful than lambs,- calves, and kids, gave the confie1-
lations, ;under \V hich the fttn paffes during that feafon, the names of the
·three animals \Vhich enrich mankind moft The firfl \vas named Aries,
the fecond .~fatuus, the third the· tv1o kids, G·en1ini, the better to cha-
raCterize the fecundity of goats, \vbich . n1ore cornmonJy bring fortb t\VO
young ones than one, and an abundance of tnilk n1ore than fi1fiicient to
nourilh them. ~
The bulk of mankind had already very often rcn1arkcd, tha~ there "·as
.a point to \vhich the fun raifed itfelf in i~s con1ing to\vards t)1e1n, but
-vvhich it neve~ exceeded; az1d that it clftcr\Vards funk daily~ in receding
from them·, for fix nionths together, till it arrived at another point a great
\Vay under the nrf}, but belo\V \V hich it never defcended. ~fhis retreat.
of ..the fun, n1ade very flo,vly, and al\vays back,vard, gave the obfervcrs.
the occ,1!ion of difiingui!hing the fiars, \vhich follo\V the t\\·o kids, or
Gen1ini, by the nan1e of the. anin1aJ that \valks backtvrrd, viz. Cancer,
the crab. \Vhen the fun pafles under the next conilellation, it n1akes our
clin1abe feel fultry heats, but chiefly the climates \\'here n1en \Yere at thnt
tin1e all gathered together. When poets attribute to that conftcllation the
fiercencfs and raging of the Lion, of \Vhich it bears the nan1e, it is very
eafy to guefs at \vhat might cietermine that choice fron1 the beginning.
Soon· after, the houfing of the hay and the corn is entirely over through..
out the cafr; there remai~ on the ground only a fe,v ears fcattered here
and there, .\vhich they caufed to be gieaned by the leafi neceffary. hands;
this \Vnrk is left to·the youngefr girls. Ho\v then could they repre(cnt the
confl:ellation) und~r \vhicl~ the fun fees no longer any crops on the ground,
better than by the name and figure of a young maid gleaning? 'fhe 'vings
you fee her ha\~e in the fpheres are ornan1ents added of later date, after the
introclutti0n of fables. The Virgin, \Vhich follovJs the Lion, is certainly ,
nQ other th~n a gleaning gir], or, if you \vill, a· reaper; and, left \Vc
ihou1d n1ifiake her funClions, ihe befides lias in .her hand a clufier of ears.;

p.fhc perfeCt equality of days and nights, \vhich happens \vhcn tl1c fun
quits the !ign Virgo, caufcd afironotners to give the next fign the name of
Libra, that is, of a balilncc. ''J he frequent difcafcs \v.hich the fun leaves

Scorpio; becaufc it is mifchicvous, and drags after it a fiing and vcnotn.
To\Vttrds the end of autumn, the fall of the Jeaf cxpofes \Vild beafis, ]cav-

and it is of ill confcquence to fuffcr the propagation of b.cu!ls at the ap-
proQch of 'vintcr. .Every thing then invites us to hunt, and the fign, in
\Vhich the fun is at that time. has from thence obtained the name of
SagittJrius; that is, the archer, or buntfman. \Vhat is the proper and
djftinetive charaCter of the 'vild goat, or Capricorn, of v;hich the fir!l:
1ign of \vinter has the nan1e? it is to look for its food, getting from the
foot of the tnountaiqs to the highe£1:. fummit, and al\vays climbing from
rock to rock : the name of Capricorn \Vas then fit to inform men of .
the time \\'hen the fun, having reached the lo\vefi verge of its courfc, \Vas
ready. to begin to afcend again to\vards the higheft, and to continue to do.
fo for Gx months together. 1·his is quite the,..rcverfe of the crab (Cancer);
and the happy concurrence of the oppofite characters of thefe t\VO animals
is a proof of \vhat directed the firfl:. obfervers in the impofition of all the1't!
nan1es. Aquaries and Pifees, \Vi~hout any difficulty, mark out the rainy
fcafon, and the titne of the year'\vhcn fifl1cs, £ttter and nicer than in any
other tin1c, bring on again the profit and plcafure of fi!hing. It .n1ay be
1~cn1arked, th,H, of the t\velve confiellations, there are ten, the name.; of
\vhich arc borro\vcd fron1 feveral animals ; \vhich caufcd afironorners to-

eafily underftood that the fun, then ready to rife, was 'at the difrancc of

\vas, ho\v far the year wa~ advanced, and-what kind of work it \vas fit

rality of Jncn now difpcnfe \Vith looking among the' fiars for the kno\V·
Iedge of the operations and order of the year. But \vriting itfelf, that
fo ufeful invention, is one of the prod~cts of aftrononiy; and it may be
eafily !he\vn alfo, that the names given the twelve ccieftiaJ figns gave birth
to the invention both o.f painting ·and \Vriting. The hiftory of the heavens

.N 0\V' merely to kno\V and to underfrand tho.fe divifions of the heavens

verfant in the affeEiions and qut~lities of the heavenly n1atter, and of the pia..

ened in the eighth orb of the celeftial heaven, and only move as that orb
doth, and uniformly together, about one .minute)s fpace in a \vhole year;
but reafon haG not abfolutely determined this point, fo as to leave it quite
fatififactory, or incontrovertible. 1'he fixed ftars are obferv€d to differ ·

·The.fe confiellations, or groups of fixed ll:ars, have doubt1efs their
difl:inCl: energy and influence in the operations of nature; although \ve
have not means fufficient to difiinguilh them all, according to their
peculiar virtues. ,The.nearer they are fituated to the ~cliptic line, and
the zodiac, fo much the apter are they to operate in the common .aCls
of nature; and fo much the more eafily allured into the opportunities
of our acquaintauce. Of the firfl: magnitude v1e have an ·extraordinary
infl:ance in that fl:ar in Leo ca1led,.l1:0r Leonis, in t~enty-~ve degrees of ,
the fign, known to be of the nature of Mars and Juptter mtxed together;
and a fl:ar greatly contributing to noble qualifications, and.kingly favour.
Famous alfo is the kno\vledge of Spica Virginis, a ftar of Virgo by con-
ftellation, but in the fign Libra : this fl:ar partakes both of the nature·of
Venus and Mars, and contributes greatly to ecclefiafiical preferffients.
After thefe are the very-\vell-kno\vn ftars ca)Jed Aldebaran in.Gemini, and
Antares

OF A S T R 0 L 0 G Y. 95
Phito(ophers have a1 fo aOigned another reafon for this order and divi-
fion of the t\Vc:lvc figns of the Zodiac, nan1:ly, That Nature \\'Orks by
<
'ppofition nnd contr:triety, and thus brings about the four fiates of :tit
clcn1cnt::try bodies, viz. gener:1tion, confcrvation, corruptiC?n, and anni-
hilation. As therefore generation is the firft fiate, 2nd is produced and
nouri01ed by heat, they begin \vith the fiery fign Aries. '1 J1e nc:xt qua-
lity being confervation, or durability, they fignify the fame hy placing
an earthy fign next in order, fince earth gives pern1anency and fixatio11
to corruptible bodies. 'fhe third quality being corruptible, it is repre-
fented by an airy fign, hecaufe air is kno\vn to be the fource of putre-
faction. The laft !late of an elementary body is its final end or difto..
lution; and, as \Vater di!Tolves all corruptible bodies, fo have they de-
fcribed it by placing 3 \Vatery ftgn the lail of all. In this arrangement of
the figns of the Zodiac we n1ay further obferve, that t\Vo paffive prin-
ciples nre placed between lWO active ones; and, as our a1J-v,ife Cre:ltor
hath fo confirufred nature, that·thc oppofition of one thing fi1ould oc-
cafion the exifience or duration of another, fo \Ve may obferve it in the
divifions of the Zodiac; for infiance, Aries, a fiery fign, is placed oppo-
fite to Libra, which is an airy fign; and in all refpetls refernhles a 1nan
fitting over a fire with a pair of bello\VS in his hands, blowing to keep
it burning: for, without air, fire is foon extinguilhed. In the fan1e man·
ner it is vvith the \Yater and the earth; but, to make thefe obfervations
more apparent, we will arrange the figns of the Zodiac under all their
different qualities and forms.

tfhere 3re figns called qundrupediln, or four-footed, as ¥ ~ n .t :.:?,
becaufe thoft: creatures fron1 \Vhcnce thev are n.1med have four feet; and
in a nativity, \vhere either of thcn1 nfce~d, they import tha: the cont1:i..
tution of the native partakes rnuch of the nature of that creature they
reprefent; for inft.1nce, if Aries afcends, then he \vill be hot nnd dry, and
p;nt:1kc of the qualiti~s of the ran1; if 1..aurus be lord of the afcendant~
he \Vill be furious, as the hull; if Leo afccnd, he \vill be in natu.re bold
and magnanimous; if S.1gittarius, he \\'ill be perfevcring and intrepid;
if Capricorn, he will be lufiful and libidinous, like the goat. So there
are figns of hun1anity, as II,~ cQ: =,and the firfi part of .t; and in nativi-
ties wh~re any of thefe figns afccnd, or in \vhich the lord of the afcend-
ant is placed, it fignifies thJt the native is of a friendly difpofition, hu-
Ul:lne, affable, and courteous; of an excellent carriar:;e, and engaging bt:-
ha\'icur. Again., (orne figns nre c~lled fruitful, ns 2D n1. x; and, if the
:1fcend~nt, or his lord, or the moon, be placed in any one of thefc, or
if the cufp of the fifth houfe has one of tbefe upon it, or if his lord be
pofited in one of them, the native will have many children, or \YiJl be
of a prolific confi:itution; but, if barren ligns poilt:fs the aforefaid pbces~
then, according to the plain courfe of nat urc, fieri 1ity and barren nefs ,,,j11
follo\V. 1""here are ulfo fo1ne ligns termed mute, as !.!3 "1 x. If any of
thefe afcend in a nativity, and 1V1ercury, \V ho is the genera1 fign ifi<::ltor
of fpeech, be afHitl:ed by the planets Satuni and the Dragon's 1..ail in
an evil houfe of heaven, and the afcendant alfo vitilted, the n2ti~'e \Vill
be born dun1b; if Mercury be free, and the afcendant only aflli(tcd, or
if the afcendant be free, and Mercury affiiEled, the native \Vill be ge-
nerally filent, and flo\v of fpeech. But if figns of voice afccnd in a
nativity, as n ~ 2D t ::, the native wil1 poffefs a volubility of fpcecb,
and be a good orator. Ag~in, fome figns arc feral, i.e. brutiih, or
fJvage; fuch are n and the lail: part of Sagittarius. Sun1e are tern1ed
hoarfe, or \\'hi filing, as r.r ~ n. l".f; and whenever Leo, or the lall: p,lrt of
Sagittarios, alcend in a nativity, the native \Vi 11 be brutifi1ly inclined~

In t he firft co1umn againa ¥ you find 8; 1 5. 3o, under the co1u111 n of

f<;minine, and from 22 to 30 are maiculine. 1'he ufe of which is, that.
if the principal fignificator in a nativjty be pofited in the degrees and figns
mafculine, be the native male or female, it argues that he or fJJe fhall
inherit a' rnore ol:lfculine temper and refolution than ordinary. But, if
the fignificator be in feminine figns and degrees, then the native will be
more effeminate, titnid, and leis robufi. The fatne obfervation holds
good with refpeCt to the other figns and degrees, as in the table they
ftand direCted. 1

in ~ nntivity, the native \vi11 be of a fairer and clearer complexion than
ordinary. ~rhe fifth colunln !hews that there are degrees terrncd dark or
oijcure; nnd, vvhenever thefe hlppen to be horofcopical in a nativity, they
declare the native to be of a d~uk or fallow cornplexion, and, if he lhould
be born defor~ned, his-deformity will be confidcrably greater. The fixth
column fhe\VS \Vhich degrees of the zodiac are tcnnedji11oky; and, if any
of thetn arife on the eafiern fineter at the tin1e of birth, they declare the
native of a mixed complexion, neither fair nor fwarthy, but partaking of
both; and fimilar to his complexion will be his underfianding. '[he
feventh column !hews \Vhich of the degrees of the zodiac 3re called void;
and, if the afccndant in the radix of any nativity be pofited in them, it
declares an imbecility in the judgment and underftanding of the native;
and, the farther he enters into converfation or bufinefs, the n1orc obvious
\Vill this defeCt: appear. 1·he eighth column points out \vhat degrees in
each of the t\ve)ve figns are called deep and pitted; and thcfe, in a nativity,
fignify, that if the afcendant, his lord, or the rnoon, .be fituateCi in any of
them, the native will be of a hafiy and imperfeEl: fpeecb, incapable of ex-
preffing his defires, or of declaring his fentiments; and \Vi11 al\vays be in-
volved in vexatious litigations and difputes; and, tike a man in a pit or
fnare, will want the affiftance of another to help him out. The ninth"
column diftinguilhes the azimene, la!JJe, or dejicie11t, degrees; and, if. in a
nativity any one of thefe afcend, or the lord of the afcendant, or the 1noon,
be in any of thetn, the native will be crooked, ]arne, or defonned, or in
fome manner vitiated in the member or part of the body that the fign
governs in which fuch azimene degrees lhall happen to be. This rule
is {o unexceptionable and invariable, that it ought to be \Vel] conlidered
in the judgment of every nativity. The tenth column points out all the
degrees in the ,twelve figns that are augn1entors or increafers of fortune;
and the knowledge to be derived from thern is, thJt if, in a nativity, the
cufp of the fecond houfe, or lord of the fecond, Jupiter, or part of for-
tune, be in degrees augmenting, they then becotne argurncnts of much
\Yealth; and prefage that the native fhall, according to his capacity or
.fituati9n in life., attain to frill- greater honour, riches, and preferment.

This fign, obfervation and expei·ience both. inform us, is hot and

at .
a birth, or if the fun or moon be pofited in it,. it ·ufually cont-ributes
unto the native a dry body, lean and fpare,' ftrong and large bones and
lin~bs, piercing eyes, a fw~rthy or fallow complexion. and fandy-co..
loured or red hair, and inclines him .to be choleric, ·brutal, violent, and
intemperate; that ·is, this fign natura11y prodl:lces thefe effeas. ·But, if ·

Aries is an equinoctial, cardinal, diurna), n1oveable, fiery, choleric,
hot and dry, luxurious, violent, fign; ea!l:ern, and of the fiery triplicity.
It is the day-houfe of Mars, and confifis ·of twelve ftars. T·he difeafes

Saturn is the moll: fupreme, or mofi elevated, of all the planets, being
placed bet\veen Jupiter and the firmament, at about feven hundred and
eighty mi11ions of n1 i1es from the fun. It t rave1s in its orh at the rate of
~ighteen thou£1nd miles· every hour, nod perfonns it~ annual revolution
round the fun in t\veoty.. nin~ years, one hundred and fixty.feven days,
and fi\'e hours, of our titnc; \Vhich n1ak~s only one year to that planet.
And, though it appears to us no larger than a fiar of the third n1agnitude,
yet its dia1neter is found to be no lefs than fixty-fcvcn thoufand Englilh
tbi]es; and confeqttently near fix hundred times as big as the earth I 'fhis
planet is furrounded by a thin broad ring, fornevvhat refecnbling the ho-
rizon of an artificiaJ globe; and it appears double \Vhen feen through a
good ttlefcopc. It is inclined tbircy degrees to the ecliptic, and is about
t\venty-one thoufand miles in breadth; \Vhich is equal to its difi:ance
fron1 Saturn on all fides. There ·js reafon to believe that the ring turns
round its axis, becau!c, when it is n]nJofl: edge-\vnys to us, it uppears fome-
\Vhat thicker on one fide of the pLtnet than on the other; and the thickcfi:
edge has been feen on different fides at d1tferent ti~ncs . But, Saturn hav..

Saturn is in nature cold and dry, occafioned · by his being fo far re-
.n1oved frorn the heat of the fun; abounds in moift vapour,s, and is a me-
lancho1y, earthy, 01afcu11ne, folitary, di urna1, rna1evo1ent, . p1anet ; an d
the greater infert·une. His efretls, \Vhen lord of the afcendant, or prin-
cipal ruler of a nativity, with all his qualities, are as foliow: he produces
.a middle ·fiature, wi.th a dark, fwarthy, or pale, ·cornplexion, fcnall leer-
. ing black eyes, broad forehead., lean fac~, lowering brow, thick nofe
and lips, large ears, black or bro\vn hair, broad {boulders, thin beard,
\Vith fo1all lean thighs and legs. If this planet is \vell dignified at the
.time of ·birtb, the nntive \vilrhe of an acote and penetrating imagination;
in his conduCt, aufiere; in words~ refer·ved; in fpeaking and giving, very
fpare; in labour, patient; in arguing or difputing, grave; in obtaining
the goods of this life, frudious and felicitous; in his attachments, either
-tO \Vife Or f-riefld, COOfl:ant and UOequivoca) ; in prejudic-e Or refentment,
rigid and inexorable. But, if this planet be ill dignified at the ti1ne of
birth, the native will be naturally fordid, envious, covetous, ~ifirufifuJ,
.cowardly, fluggilh, outwardly diifembling, fa]fe, fiubborn, malicious,
an.d perpetua11y di!Tatisfied with himfelf, and with all about him. When
Saturn js _
oriental, the human ftature will be iliorter than ufual, and, when
occid~nta1, thin, lean, and lefs hairy. If his latitude be north, .the na-
tive will be hajry and corpulent.; if without any latitude, he will be of
large bones .an.d m.ufclesl and, if meddional, fat, fn1ooth, and flelhy; in

weak and ill-favo.ured. Thefe remarks like\vife hold ·good -with refpeet
to all the .
oth<:r planets. It is alfo .to be remarked, that, when Saturn is
fignificator .of travelling, he betokens long and laborious journeys, peril-

1"'he fignifi.cation of VJ hich, in all:rology, is, that, if a kingdom, city,
· town, principality, or family, takes its rife when Saturn is etTentia11y
and accidentally firongt and \Vell fortified, it is probable the fame will
continue in honour and profpedty, without any material alteration, for
t he fpace of four hundred and fixty-five ye~rs. Again, if in a nativity
Saturn Is well dignified, is lord of the geniture, and not affiiete-d by any
crofs-afpeets, .then the native, according to the comrnon courfe of na-
ture, ·may Jive fifty-feven years; if the planet be but meanly dignified,
then the native will not live rnore than forty-three years; and, if he be
wea~ly dignified, he will not live 1nore than thirty years ; for the na·
ture of Saturn at beft is cold and dry, '-''hich are qualities deftruetive to
health and long life in man.
I
Orb.-Saturn's orb is nine degrees before and after any afpeet; that is,
his influence begins to operate; v.rhen either he applies, or any planet ap-
plies to him, within nine degrees of his perfect afpeet; and his influence'
continue~ in force until he is feparated nine degrees frocp the afpea partial.

. Jupiter is the next planet below Safurn, and called the greattr fortune.
He appears to our fight the largeft of any fi:ar in o1agnitude except
Venus; and is of a bright refplendent clear afpeCl. Modern afi:r'l>nomers
hlve proved him to be four hundred and twenty-fix millions of miles from
the fun~ and above a ihoufand times bigger than our earth; he goes ·in
his orbit at the afionilhing rate of near twenty-fix thoufand miles an bout:,
and his dian1eter is cornputed at eighteen thoufand Engliih n1iles, \vhich
i,s n1ore than ten times the diameter of the earth. He completes bis
coude throug~ the twelve figns of the zodiac in eleven, years, three hun·
dred and fourteen days, and rwel\'e hours. He is confid~ril hly f\vifter in
1notion than Saturn 1 but to us his tnean 1notion is four·mintHes fifty-
nine feconds; his·fwifter ·motion fourteen minutes. He h~s exaltntion
in :fifteen degrees of Cancer; fuffers detriment in Gernini and Virgo,
and receives his fall in fifteen degrees of Capricorn. - His greatefi: lati-
tude north is one degree thirty-eight xninutes, and his g• ec.:efi latitude
fouth one degree and forty tninutes. He is retrograde one hundred
and twenty days ; ~nd fl:ationary five days before and four days after his
retrogradation. His orb, or radiation, is nine degrees before and after
·2ny of his afpeCls.
Jupiter is a diurnal, mafculine, planet, temperately hot and. moift,
airy and fanguine ;' author of te1nperance, niodefty, fobriety, and juf- ·

head, large grey eyes, loft thick bro\\·n hair, a wcll-fct comely body, fhort
neck, large \vide chefl; robuH, firong, and \\'ell-proportioned, thigh~ and
Jeo-s, with long feet ; his fpcech fobcr and manly, and his converfation
at~tve and commanding. And, if 'vell dignified at the birth, this planet
tctokens moll admirable manners and difpofition to the native. He \Vill
be in general 1nagnanintous, faithful, and prudent, honourably afpiring
after high de{crts and noble u&ions, a ]over of fair dealing, dcfirous of
[erving ~ll1nen, jufl,·honcfi, and religious; of eafy accefs, and of affable
manners and con'verfittion; kind and affeB:ionate to his fatnily and friends;
charitable and liberal to the utmofi extent of his abilities; \vife, prudent,
and virtuous, hating alltnean and fordid a&ions. . But, ifJupiter be ill..
dignified, ancl affiiEted \vitp evil afpeas at the time of birth, he then be-
tokens a profligate ahd carelefs difpofition, of mean abilities, and fhallo\v
underfianding; a bigot in religipn, and obfiinate in maintaining errone-
ous doB:rines; abanC:ioned to eyil company; eafily feduced to folly and
extravagance; a fycophant to· ·every one above him, and a tyrant in his
O\Vn fan1ily. If the planet be oriental at the birth, the native \viii be
more fanguine and ruddy, with larger eyes, and more corpulent body~
and generally ·gi·ves a mole or mark upon the -
right foot. lf occidental,

fviars is next located to Jupiter, and is the fir!l: planet above the.earth
and 1noon's orbit. His diUancc from the fun is computed at one hundred
and t'venty-five millions of miles; and, by travelling at the rate of. forty-
fevcn thoufand miles every hour, he goes round the fun in fix hundred
and eighty-fix of our days, and four hours ; which is the cxaa length of
l1is year, and contains fix hundred and fixty.feven days and three quar-
ters; b~tt eyery daY. and night together is forty minu~es longer than ~ith
us. HIS dtameter 1s four thoufand four hundred and forty-four mtles,
v;hich is but a fifth part fo large as the earth. l-Ie is of a deep fiery red.
colour, and by his appulfes to fomc of the fixed fiars, feems to be en-
. con1paffed by a very grofs atmofphere. I-Iis tnean motion is thir.ty-one
degrees twenty-leven minutes; npd his fv1ift motion from thirty-tw·o to·

corn ; his fall in twenty-eight degrees of Cancer, and his detriment in
Libra and ,..faurus. His greatcft north latitude js four degrees thirty-one
· tninutes, and his greatefl fouth latitude fix degrees forty-feven minutes.
He is retrograde eighty days, and Hationary two or three days before re-
trogradation, and two days before direRion. His orb or radiation is
feven degrees before and after any of his afpeCls.
Mars is a mafculinc nocturnal planet, in nature hot anp dry, choleric
and fiery, the fmaller i.nfortune, author of quarrels, di!fentions, firife, Vw..ar·
and battle; and rules the gall, left ear, head, face, fmell, imagination,.
and attraaive faculty of tnan. ~fhis planet, prefiding at a birth, renders
up a fl:rong well..fet body, of fhort fl:ature, but large bones, rather lean
than fat; a brown ruddy complexion, red, fandy, flaxen, or light bro\Vn,
hair, round face, {harp hazle eyes, confident bold countenance, aaive and

vincible difpofition ; unfufceptible of fear or danger; hazarding his life
en all occafions, and in all perils; fubjea to no reafon in \Var or conten-

The Moon is next belo,v lVIars, being a fatellite or attendant on the
earth, and goes round it f'rotn chanqe to cnange in t\\·enty-nine days t\vel\"e
hours and forty-four n1inutes; ano round the fun \Vith it every year. 1-he
tnbon's diameter is t\VO thoufand one hQndred and e~hty miles; and her
difiance from the earth's centre is two hundred and torty thoufand miles.
She goe.s ro~nd her orbit in t\venty.feven days feven hours and forty-three
minutes, moving about t\vo thoufand two hundred and ninety miles every
hour; and turns .round her axis exacrly in the time that fhe goes round "
the earth, \Vhich. is the reafon of her always keeping the fame fide towards
us, and that her day and night taken together is as long as our lunar
month. She is an opaque globe, like the earth, and !hines only by re-
fleaing the light of the fun ; therefore, 'vhilft that half of her which is
to\vards the fun is enlightened, the other part mufi Ee dark and invifible.
Hence fhe difappears \Vl~en fhe comes between us and the fun; becaufe her
dark fide is then to,vards us. When fue is gone a little 'vay for.\vard, \V"e ·
fee a little of her enlightened fide; which fiill increafes to our view as
fhe advances for,Nard, untillhe comes to be oppofite the fun, and then her
whole·enlightened fide is towards-the earth, and fhe ap~ears 'vith a round
illumined orb, which we call the full inoon, her dark fide being then
turned.away (rom the earth. From the full fh~ feems to decreafe gra-
dually as the ·goes through the other half of her courfe, fhe,ving us lefs
and lefs of her enlightened fide every day, till her next change, or con-

tion is thirteen degrees ten minutes and thirty-fix feconds ; l1er .f\vift
or ditirn~l motion often varies, but never exceeds·fiffeen degrees t\vo mi-
llUtes in twenty·four hours. Her greaten north latitude is fi\'e degrees
and feventcen minutes ; and her greateR fouth latitude is five degrees and
twelve minutes, or thereabouts. She is never fiationary nor retrograde,
but alwars direa; though when fhe is flo\v in motion, and goes lefs than
thirteen degrees in twenty.four hours, fhe is confidered equivalent t_

· rhe·Moon is feminine, noaurnal, cold, moifi, and phlegmatic. .Her
influence, in idelf, is neither fortunate nor unfortunate, but as fhe hap-
pens to fall 1n \vith the configurations of the other planets, and is then
J
\ either malevolent or otherwile as thofe afpeas happen to be. And un-
der thefe circumfiances llie becomes ~he moft powerful of all·the hea-
venly bodies in her'operations, by reafon of her proximity to the earth,
and the f\viftnefs of her motion, by which llie-receives and tranfmits to .
us the light and influence of all the fuperiors by her config4ratioqs, with
tnem. When fhe has _rule in a ~ativity., llie produces a f:1ll flat~re, with
fair and.pal'! cornplexion, round face, gr~y eyes, lowenng bro·w·, verv
hairy, fhort,arms, thick hands and feet, fmooth body, inclined·'to be fat,
corpulent, and phlegn1atic. If !he be impedit~d of the fun at the ·time
of birth, fue leaves a b1emifh on or near the eye ; if !he be impedited in
fuccedent houfes, the blemi!h will be near the eye; but if \Vith fixed
flars, and in unfortunate angles, the blemilh wiH fall in the eye, and
will affea the fight. If Ihe be \\~ell dignified at the nativity, the .'native
\Vill be of foft engaging manners and difpofition, a lover of ·the polite
arts, and of an ingenious imagination, fond of novelties~ and given to
travelli~g, or rambling about the country ; unfiable, and providing only
for the prefent time,. carelefs of futurity; timorous, prodtgal, and eafily
affrighted.; but- lovins-,peace, and defiring to live free from the cares.and
anxieties· of the world. If the native be brought'up to a ,m'echanieal
employment, he will be frequently tampering with a variety of different
trades, ·but purfuing none of them ·long together. If the Moon be ill-
dignified at the birth, the native will then be flothful, indolent, and of
no forecafl; given UE to a drunken, ~iforderly, beggarly life, hating la-
bour, or any ki~d of bufinef~ or employmen~. When oriental, .~e in-

Venus is the next planet below the earth and.tnoon, having her.orbit
within that of the earth. She _is computed to be fi(ty-nine millions of
inlle~ fro'm 'the' ft..p1; and, by mo\7ing at the .
rate of fixty-nine thoufand
miles every hour, fhe paffes through .thetwelve figns of the zodiac in t'NO
hundred and twenty-four days feventeen hours of our time nearly. Her
diameter is feven thoufand nine hundred and fix miles, and by her diur..
nal motion file is carried about her equator forty-three miles every hour,
befides the fixty-nine ·thoufand above...mentioned. When fhe appears weft ·
ofthe fun, fhe.rifes before him in the morning, and is called the morning
jlar; but when fhe appears eafi. of the fun, fhe fhines in the evenin·g after
.he fets, and is then called the eveningjlar; and continues ~lternately for
the fpace of two hun~re~ and n_inety days in each of thefe fituations: It I
may perhaps be thought furpnfing at firft, that Venus £hould·conttnue
longer on the eafl or wefi fide of the fun than the ~hole time of her pe-
riod round him '; but t11.e difficultr vanifhes '\\rhen 've confider 'that the
earth is all the while going round the fun th~ fame way, .though not fo
quick as Venus; and therefore her relative motion to the earth mull in
every period be as much flower than her abfolute ~otion in her orbi~, as
the earth during that time advances forward iJ
n the ecliptic, \vhichjs two
hun.dred and twenty degrees. 1~o us !he appears through the telefcope
in all the various fhapes of the moon. Her mean motion is fifty-nine mi-
nutes eight feconds; ·and'her daily or fwift motion is from .fixty-two n1i-
nutes to one degree twenty.. two minutes, -
but never greater. Her utmofl
latitude, either north or footh, never exceeds nine degrees t\ro minutes.
Her exaltation is in twenty-feven degrees df Pifces ; her detriment in
Aries and Scorpio; and her fall in twenty-feven degrees of Virgo. She
continues retr~grade forty-two days, and is·Hationary t'vo days befo"re and
t'vo days af~r her fiate of rerrogradatibn. Her orb, or radiation, i'sfeven
degrees before, ~nd after any of her 'afpeas. I_n the human firuaure i)le
governs the retns, back-hone, feed, and ferptna1ve~e1s; alfo the nel:k,
throat, breafis, and expulfive faculty _
; and rules the bght blue and whtte .

fulnefs, and delighting in mufic ; amorous, and prone to venery, though
truly virtuous, iF a \'lOman; yet fhe will be given to jcaloufy, even \\-·ith-
out caufe. If the planet be ill.dignified, then will the nati,·e be riotous_
,profligate, abandoned to evil cornpany and lewd women, rcgardlefs of
reputation or charaEter; a frequenter of taverns, night-houfes, and all
, places of ill-fame; delighting 1n all ·the incitements to incefluous and
adulterous praaices; i!1 principle a me-~e Atheiil, ,vholly given.up to tl:c
·brutal paffions of unbrtdled ana unculuvated nature. If Venus be on-
ental at the time, the Il:ature will be tall, upright, and Il:raight; but, if
occident'al, fuort and fiooping, though comely and \\rell-favoured. If fhe

is the length of his year... But being feldom fceu, onaccount of~his proxi-
mity to the fun, and having no fpots vifible on his f1:1rface or difk, the time
of his rotation upon his own axis, and the length of his days and nights,
are as yet unknown to us. His d~fiance from the fun is computed t0 be
thirty-two millions of miles, and his diameter t\VO thoufand fix hundred.. -
He n1oves round the fun at the rate of ninety-five·thoufand mi1es every

mofi feven times as great as that of the earth. At·the times he becomes
vifible, he appears .of a bright filyer colour, though generally faint and

humane; of a large and benevolent heart, affable, and courteous; in,

fo1ar man is not of man·y words; but, \vhen he fpeaks, it is ,.;ith confi..
dence, and to the purpofe; he is ufually thoughtfuJ, fecret, and referved;
his deportment is !lately and majeHic; a lover of fumpLuoufnefs and
magnificence; and polleffes a mind far fuperior to any fordid_, baf~ or
difhonourable, praaices. If the fun be ill dignified, then \vill the native
be born .of a mean and loquacious difpofition; proud and arrogant;
difJaining all his inferiors, and a fycophant tO his fuperiors; of fhallO\V
underfianding, and imperfea judgment; refUels, troublefome, and do-

In this fcheme C-ancer and Leo have affigned unto them the t\vo
great luminaries, Sol and Luna; becaufe they are agreeable to each .other
in na.ture; for the Sun, being naturally hot and d_
ry, !hews his effeCls more
forcibly when pouted in Leo than he doth i_
n ejther Aries ~r Sagittarius.
And the Moon, for the fame rea(on, hath Cancer allotted to her govern~..
ment, becaufe {he is cold and _
moift/ and of the nature of this fign; and
bein'g the firil of .t h~ watery triplicity, and next to the Sun,s houfe, w fhe'
receives her light' froin him ; ·and all things are generated by their joint ~

has for his manfi9n the figos Capricorn and A,qua_r~es ;_ \vhich ·are the
oppofire :figns to Leo and Cancer, and are conf~quent1y cold nod moift.

Jtipitcr is placed under Saturn, and has the two 1igns that go before
and after Capricorn and Aquaries allotted for his houfes, namely, Sagit..
t~try and Pilees, which are in trine to the houfcs of the t\vo luminaries;
Pifccs, his night-houfc, is in trine to Cancer, the houfc of the nocturnal
lun1inary, and Sngittary, his day-h9ufe, in. trine to Leo, the houfe of the
diurnal luminary. Jupiter, being naturally temperate, and having thcfe
amicabl.e nfpeets, is deen1ed the moO: benevolent of all the planets to man-
kind, and the greaterfortune.
Mars next in order follows Jupiter, being placed under him ; and~
therefore thofc figns that go before and after the houfes of Jupiter are al..
lotted to Mars, viz. ScorpiQand Aries, .which are in quartile to the houfes
of the Sun and Moon, ,as Aries his day-houfe is to Cancer, and Scorpio

The TRIPLICITIES of the PLANETS•
..
-
A Triplicity means three ligns of the Zodiac, of one and the fatne
nature, making a perfect triangle ; and of thefe triplicities among the
:figns there are fovr, anfwering to the four elements : viz. the fiery tri-
plici(y, \vhich confiils of Aries, Leo, and Sagittary; lhe .airy .triplicity;
confifting of Gemini, Libra, , and Aquaries; the \Vatery.triplicity, .con•
taining Cancer, Scorpio, and Pifces; and the earthy triplicity, \vhi~h
includes Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. Thefe figns apply to each other
in a trine, in the fan1e manner as a planet in a fiery fign applies to an.other ,
palnet in a fiery fign (if in the ~ame Jnumber of degrees) in.a tri~e; and
, ~ .· . 4 thus

'
' ..
, . 0 F A S T R 0 IJ 0 G Y.
thus a planet in an airy. fign beholds another plnnet in an airy lign \Vith a
trine; and fo the \vatery and earthy fign!i apply in the fi1me xnanner; and
each of thefc trine afpects confifts of one hundred and t\vcnty degrees.
The Sun and Jupiter.have dominion over the fiery triplicity ; the Sun
by day. and Jupiter by night. 'fhc Sun by day, bccaufe he is hot and
fiery, and of the narure of thefe figns ; and Jupiter by night; bccaufe he
is temperate, and moderates the cx.trcmity of peat. 'I'his is called the
eaficrn triplicity.
-
Saturn and Mercury have dominion over the airy triplicity, \Vhich is
'vefiern; ·Mercury, by night, and Saturn by day. But as Libra is tbe
exaltation of Saturn, and 1\quaries the houfe and fign wherein he has moft
joy ; and ns' Gen1ini is only the houfe of Mercury; it follo\\'S that Sa-
turn has the principal governtnent in this triplicity.
Mars both night and day governs the watery triplicity, \vhich is nor-
thern; and it feen1s:that Mars \vas· appointed·to this triplicity to tem-
per and abate his violent heat ; for \Ve fi~d he is more po\verful in his
malignant effed:s in the .fign Leo than he is in Cancer; therefore he has
his fall apointed him in Cancer, though he is peregrine in Leo.
Venus and. the Moon bear rule over the ..earthy triplicity, \vhich is fe..
mine and fouthern, cold and tnoift, producing fouth-caft winds-,. and
cold moifr air; hence this triplicity is affigned to the: care of feminine
~planets. . ' ~ , r

A Term· is a certain number of degrees, in each houfe orlugn of the.
Zodiac, '\Vherein the planets Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, '.renus, and Mcrcur.r,·
have a certain priority; but the ·Sun and Moon have no terms. Thefe'
degrees are called terms, ends, or boun-ds; for the planets have each their
proportions fo allotted therein, that· at the end of a certain number of
degrees, the tern1s of one planet ceafe, and thofe of another begin. .
For inHance, from the fir!l degree oi- Aries· to the fixth, are the terms
of Jupiter; frotn the fi~tb to the fourteenth, arc the terms of Venus·;

rrhe degrees are in this manner divided into terms, to !hew what pla-
net has moft dignities in a fign, vvhether by exaltation and houfe, tripli-
city and .houfe, cir houfeJ exa]tation. or triplicity, alone j · and to that
plane,t which .has.t\vo or ·more dignities, we affign the firft .term, \vhe...
ther.he be·a fortune or an infortune. If an infortune has not two dig-
nities in a fign, he is placed lafi, and the firil term is given either to the
lord of the exaltation, or to the lord of the triplicity, or to the lord
~f the houfe, unifo! mly preferring that planet which h~s two dignities
to thofe that have only one. But an exception to this rule extends to the
figns Cancer and Leo; for Cancer being the oppofite fign ro the exalta-
tion of Mars., which ·is in Capricorn, occafions the firfi term of Cancer
to b~ affigned to :N!ars; and, becaufe L~o _is the oppofite fign ~o the houfe .
.and JOY of ~·aturn, the firfi tern1 of Leo ts for thts reafon g1ven to Sa-
turn. 'fo the infortur:tes are allotted the lafi- degrees of all the figns, ex-
cepting thofe-of Leo, which are given to Jupiter. '"fhe quantity of terms
arc divided according to the ·following method ; when Jupiter and Ve-
llUS have not two.dignities .in the fame fign, nor. in the fecond, third, or
fourth, houfe, they have feven degrees a)lotted for their terms. Saturn
and Mar~, becaufe they are infortunes, (except in their own houfes, t have
~ut five, and fometimes only four, three, or two, degrees each. Mereu- I
ty, ' becaufe he is of a n1ixed nature, has ufually fix degrees allotted him;
but, when .any of the planets are eifentially dignified, they claim each one
degree more·; as Venus in the :firfi ·term of Taurus has eight degrees, and

Saturn in the firfl: term of Aquaries claims fix. put, becaufc Venus has
eight degrees in 'faurus, Sclturn has only two. bcjng very wc:.k in 1'au-
r~5; and again, in Sagittary, Jupitcr is incrcafcd one degree, bccaufc he
is firong, and 1\'Icrcury is dirntnithcd ouc degree, bccaufc he is \Vcak; fo
that Jupiter t~1kes eight degrees, and leaves Mercury but five.
It is alio ncccffi1ry to obfervc, that a planet in his ovJn tcrn1 is firong;
and that the n1ore dignities he gaiflS therein, the firongcr \Viii his influ-
ence be; for exan1ple, Jupitcr in the lid[ tcnn of Sagittary is firongcr
and more po\vcrtul· than in t.hc firft term of Aries. though they arc
both equally his tenns; and ·th~ reafon. of this is, becaufc the fign Sa-
gittary is both his houie and triplicity, and Aries is his triplicity only,
\vhereforc he has the firf~ eight" degrees of Sagittary for his tcrn1, and
only fix in Aries. Hence it becoo1es apparent, that, the nearer a planet is
in nature to the place of his term, the flronger \viii his influence be
therein. · Jupiter; being ho~ and tnojH, has but five degrees for his term
in \'irgo, \Vhich is a col(l a.t:ld dry iign; but in Gemir.i, which is hot
and moitl, he has fi.~ degrees,· becaufe it agrees \vith his nature; and yet
in Cancer, \,·hich is cold and rnoifi, he po!feifes fevcn degrees, althongh ·
it does not agree \V i~h his nature; and the reafon is, Cancer is the houfe
of Jupiter's exaltation, and therefore the.greatcr term is allotted him.-
In like n1anner, if a planet that is cold and dry be pofited in a tenn of.
the fan1e temperature, his colJnefs and dryn~fs \vill be greatly iflcrcafed
thereby, and he \vill.operate the more po\vcrfully in his influences. 'fhc
fame rul~ i holds good in rcfpeCt to all the other. qualities of the planets;
and it mufi be re1nembered, that a planet is ahvays increafed in Hrength
by being fituated in houfes or place.s of his- ·o\\·n .tetnperature and quality.
1'hus a planet that is hot and dry Jofes 111UCh of his natura} vigour in a term
~bat is cold and moifi;. ptid ~ planet that is cold and . moift Jofcs confi-
derably of its nature in a terrn that is hot and dry. And in like n1anner,
if a planet that is a fortune be pofited in a fortunate tern1, his be!'lc-ficent
effeCts are the more incrcafed, and·he is fortifie-d \Vith great po\ver and
firength to operate upon 'vhatever fubjeet is the fignificator of. And
on the contrary, ifan~evil and malevolent planet be in .an evil fign ~nd term,
its effects 1vvill be thereby rendered fiill more mifchevious. And the lord
of a term \vhen pofitcd in that tenn, be the fign \vhat it may, has more
po\ver therein than the lord of the fign t or than the planet that has the
fign for its exaltation. Again, if the lord of any term be pofited in his
term, and the lord of the fign be fituatcd in another fign in afpeet \V ith
hitn, the lord of the term \Vill have more po\ver in the fign \vhere is
than the lord of the fign, and !hall be the principal figniticator; but, if
the .lord of the tenn be pofited in his O\Vn tenn and iign alfo~ then his
ftrcngth and energy \vill b~ fiill more confiderable. It may alio be ob-

It may, perhaps, be enquired, 'vhy Saturn joycth not in Capricorn, as
\vell as i11 Aquaries, fince both thefe figns arc his houfes? 'l'hc rcafon
is, that in Aquaries he has both houfe and triplicity, and is therefore bet-
ter dignified, and more potent, in Aquaries than in Capricorn. So like-
Y.'ife Jupiter joyeth in Sagittary, and.not in Pifees, becaufe in the former
fign he has both houf~ and triplicity, but in the latter he has houfe
only. The fame Qbfervation extends to the other planets. rrhe Moon,
indee~, has np triplicity.; but !he joyeth in Cancer, becaufe it is a ugn
of her o\vn qualiry and nature. Hence it appears that Saturn, though firong
and \vell dignified in Capricorn, is much fl:ronger, and has more digni-
ties, in Aquaries; Jupiter alfo hns ~rong influences when pofited in
Pifces, but q1uch ftronger 'in Sagittary; Mars is potent in Aries, but
infinit~ly more fo in Scorpio; Venus has great operation in Libra, but
in Taur;us her effeCts are more po\verful ; and :Nlercury, for the fame
caufe~ operates much more forcibly in Virgo than he does in the fign
Gemini. 'I'he efficacy of thefe rules having been proved by repeated
experience, it is ncceffary for ~very fiudent to confider them with at-
tention.
The ...~ N T I S C I 0 N s· of the P L A N E T S.
A planet's Antifcion is a certain virtue or influence it acquires by be-
ing pofited in conjunction \Vith any ilar or planet, in degrees equa11y dif-
tant from the t\VO tropical figns, (~ancer and Capricorn: in \vhich degrees
the ~un, \Vhen it arrives, occafioils equal day and night.all over the \'\"orld.
For example, \Vhen the Sun i~ in the tenth degree of Tauru·s, he is as far
difiant from the firll: degree of Cancer a:; \Vhen in the t\velfth degree of
Leo; therefore, \vhen the Sun, pr any planet; is pofited in the tentl1 degree
of Taurus, it fcn.ds its antifcion to the t\ventieth degree of Leo; that

tninutes of Virgo; a planet·i~ t\vo degrees two Jilinutes ·of Taurus, into
twenty-eight deg~ee.s fifty-eight tninut~~ of .Leo, and fo on through the
table. 'fhefe antJfc1ons .are confidered, tn the rules of aftrology, equi-
.valent to a fextile or a trine, particularly if the planets are of the
bene.volef}t or fortuna~e kind. 'fhefe planets have alfo thcjr contra-anti-
fcions, which are of the nat tire of a qua1 tile or oppofition. 'I"o 'kno\V

degrees of Virgo, an'd his contra-anti1cion in t\venty-nine degrees of
Pifees, becaufe Pifees is ·the fign iIT,l n1ediately oppofite to Virgo, \Vhere

{extile to each other, they import that any- n1atter in difputc, treaty of
tnarrirtO'e, or other fubjcCl: of enquiry, rnay be happily tern1ina1ed, or
brougl~ about, by the intervention of friends ; or thlt, for wnnt thc_rcof,

over-ruled by the tnore powcrft1l influences of n1,tlignant ones, yet it is
generally confidcred an omen of a favourable kind•

ninety degrees, or one-fourth part of the ~ircJe of the zodiac, from each
other ; it is confidered nn afpeCt of irnpe_
rfcct h,ttred, and acts vice veifa
with the Jcxtile, inclining rather to malignancy, contention, and lnisfor-
tunc, as the ~ther does to fricnd~ip~ harmony, and goo~ fortune.
A trine afpeCt !:J., imports the planets to be fit-uatcd at·the difl:ance of
one hundred and t\venty degrees, or one-third part of the circle of the 'zo-
diac, fron1 each other ; .and is fometimes called a trigona] afpcd:, or a tri-
gonocrater, implying rul~ or ddn1it1ion in a, certain trigon or t·riplicity.
'fhis is an afpeCl: of the mofi: pcrfetl: unanitnity, frien~fhip, and peace;
and it is fo confidered, becaufc \Vhcn the planets are in a A afpetl:, they
are pofited in figns prccifely of the fame triplicity and nature; that is to
f.1y, they are both'in an earthy, airy, fiery, or \Vatery, fign ; and confe- ·
qucntly both contribute the fame infl_
uences -unin1peded. But in a *•
\\'hich is an afpeet of ifi?p~rfeCl: amity, the P.lanets are pofited in ligns of
only a p·trtial nature, viz. fiery \vith an airy, or an earthy \Vith ·a watery,
fign ; and as the fiery fign is hot and dry, and the airy hot and nzo(Jl, the
earthy cold and dty, and the \Vatery cold and tnof!i, fo the pl~nets thus po-
fited, agreeing only in o~e point out 'of two,. give but an ·imperfect influ-

c The oppofition 8. of' two· planets, I lignifies their being pofited at one;
hundred and eighty degrees, or ju~ half the difiance of the zodiac, apart,
\vhich places them in a diametrical radiation. 'I'his is confidered an afpeet

.J;rt the: foregoing Table, at the top of the third colurr1n, ' note the cha-
ratters.of the afpeets, fextile *' quartile o, trine 6, and oppofition .8,
as placed oyer the figns of the zodiac. In the firft cohunn obierve the

dexter to Capricorn and fini!ler t9 Cancer ; his trine, dexter·to Sagittary
and finiiler to Leo;, and \Vould be in oppofition to a planet pofited in
equal d~grees of Libra. "f~e L1me rules apply throughout the table; but
it fntlfi 00t be forgotten, that finifier afpeCl:S go-in the fame Order \Vith the
1
figns qf the zod~ac, and Jexter contrarhvife; and that the dexter afpects
are'·more firong and powerful than the finifl:er. . And .thus, accprding to
the operations of the planets and flars, are the natures of all tnen, as the
rla~etS have predominanCY, in thetn : and fuch are the natures. of all 01an-
ner of herbs and plants that gr<?\V in the field. Son1e are influenced by
Saturn, and thence are cold and dry:· others by Jupiter, and .thence are
hot and moift ; one by an ?rder of Mars draws· nothing but poifon to its

f\veet fap of the earth into ·~ll its fibres. If Saturn or Mars rife \Vith a
birth, it ·is ten to one hilt .the child dies- that year., unlefs Jupiter or

without tafiing them, becaufe we kno\.Y the fource from \Vhence they de-··

DIRECTION fignifies a planet tnoving on its natural courie, frotn
wefi to cafi, according to the fucccllion of the figns in the zodiac;
thus, a planet is direC"t, when it moves' in conftquenlia, fron1 Aries to
Taurus, from 'faunts to Gc1nini, &c. DireCtion is alfo a calculll.r,
\V hereby to find the time of any accident or renlarkable event that \vi11
happen to the perfon \\'ho propounds a queflion, or luts his nativity cafi-.
For infiance, a perfo:1 enquires ho\V many years he may live, by the
cour(e of the planets at the time of birrh? Having eftdb]ifhed the
Sun, Moon, or Afcendant, as ftgnificators for life, and Mars or Saturn as
promittors or portentors of death, the dirtEiion is a calculation of the
length of time \vhich the fignificator \Vill be in n1ceting the promittor ;
,and this refolves the q uefiion. In thete calculations, the 1ignificator is.
fomctimcs termed apheta, or giver of 1ife~ and the promittor anareta, or
giver of death. 'fbe direCtions ·of all the principal points of the hea-
vens, planets, and fixed fiars, as the Afcendant, Mid-heaven,. Sun~
.lYloon, and Part of Fortune, are \Vorked by the fame rule.
STATION AR.Y is underf\ood of a planet, 'vhen, to the eye or fenfes of
a beholder here on earth, it appears to ·nand fiill, \Vithout any progreffive
motion in its orbit. Not that a planet ever is or can be natural1y in this
ftate, but is only rendered fo in appearance, by the inequalities \vhich
arife from the pofitions and motions of the earth ; for... \Vere the planets
to be vie\ved from the Sun, or ce11tr! of the ijrftem, they \Vould al\vays
appear u~iform and regular;
-
RETROGR AD AT tON _itnplies an apparent motion in the planets,.
whereby they feem to go ba~k\vards in the ecliptic, and to move i11 aiJt~­
~edentia, or tO\":,a~?s t~1e antecedent figns, viz. from eafi to \\-·efr, cojltrary
to the order of dtretlton and to the fucceffion o~ the figns of the zodiac.
This alfo is an appearance produced by an oppofite motion of the earth
to that of the other planets. ·
.·
APPLIC_A'fiON fignifies tf1e approach of t\Vo planets togetner, either
by conjunCtion ~r afpetl:, and is of three kinds : the firft is, \vhen a pla-
net, 1\vift in motion, applies to one of flo\ver progr.efs; for example, fup-
pofe Mercury pofited in fixteen degrees of Gemini, an9. Mars in t\venty-
one degrees of the fame fign, both being direCt in motion; Mercury, by
having the greater apparent projectile force, \Vould overtake and form a

conjunction with Mars, \vhich is tern1ed a LiireEI applict~tion. 'fhe fe-
<"ond kind is formed by two retrograde planets; as fuppo-
fing Mercury _
in_fixteen 'degrees of Gctnini,. and Saturn 1p fifteen degrees of tl1e fan1e
fign, both retrograde, Mercury, being tqe lighter -
planet, applies to the
body of Saturn, _
a mort: ponderous planet, .by retrogra__dation: and this is
tern1ed _a rel!ograde appiication. 'fhe 1hiru kind is occafioned by one
planet _going direCt in n1otion, and tneeting another planet that is retro-
grade ; fer infiance, fuppofe Mercury ~etrograde in fixteen degrees of
Ge1nini, and Saturn direc:} in t\velve degrees of the fatne fign ; here
1\t.lcrcury, being the lighter .planet. applies to a conjundion of Saturn by
a retrograde motion -; and thefe t\vo lafi are deen1ed evil applications. It
Inuit alfo be obferved that the fu perior planets neverJapply to the inferior
but by a retrograde'tnotion; \vhereas the inferior planets apply both ways~
- '
. .
SE~ARATION is underi1ood of t\VO planets that have been either in
partile conjunCtion or afpeet, and are j~ft departed or feparated Tron1 ·
it. 1'hus, if'\Ve fuppofe Saturn in t\ve1ve degrees of Sagittary, and Ju-
piter in thirteen degrees of the .farne fign, Jupiter tvvill be ther feparated
one degree frotn a perfed: or pa·rrile conjunction \Vith Saturn j but they
'\vould ilill be in a platic conjunCtion, bccaufe they are \Vithin the moiety
of each other's (adiations, \vhich is four degrees and a half earh, confe-
quetirly thefe planets \Vould continu'e in pJatic conjunction until they
\Vere feparated nine degrees, 'and then the afpect would entirely ceafe.
1·he exaCt kno\vlcdge of every -degree of the feparations of thefe afpeCls
is of the utmofi confequence in giving judgment upon various itnpor-
tant occafions. For infiance, fuppofe it \Vere demanded "-V hether a cer-
tai..n treaty of marriage would take ·place or not? '\V hen all the afpetl:s
are collected upon the horofcope, and the t\VO planets that are fignifica-
tors of the parties are ~found applying to each other in a conjunction,
and in_comtnon or fixed fign~, the marriage may probably take place in·
fome length of titne.. If the·fignificators are pofited in rnoveable figns;
angular, and approaching f\vift in motion to a conjun~tion, it may then
be c;onfun1n1ated in a very fhort time; but, if the fignificators are fepara-
ted from a conjunction only a fc\v minutes of a degree, one n1ay fafely
conclude that there has been great pr.obability: only a fe\v days 'before,
that the \\·edding \Vould have taken place; but by this afpetl: ·the parties
appear t'o be hc.~nging in fufpen<!:e, and fo1ne dillike or change of fenti-
n1ent feen1s to have·taken place; and, as th7 fignificat6rs gradually (epa-
rate from the partile and platic conjunctions, in the f~une gradation wilr
the treaty and affections of th,e parties alienate and wear a\.vay ; and, by
the comparative time that the afpett '\vill occupy before it entirely cea1es,
fo \vill the titne be~ fo·many \Veeks, months,. or years, before the parties
!hall \Vholly relinquiih the connettion.

l'RolliniTION indicates the fiatc of two planets that arc fignificators
of fome event, or the bringing of fo1ne bufinef!i'to an i!fuc or conclu fion.
and aa·c applying to each other by CGnjunClion ; but before fuch conjunc-
tion can be fonncd, a third planet. by tncans of a f\\·ifter motion, inter-
pofcs his body, and dcltroys the expeacd conjunction, by forming an..
afpect hin1fclf; and this indicates that the rnatter under conten1plation
will be greatly retarded, or utterly prevented. l~'or example, fuppofc
I\1ars \vas pofited in fevcn degrees of Aries, Saturn in t \Vel ve degrees,
and the Sun in fix degrees, of the £unc fign ; ~Iars is the fignific3tor of.
the bufincfs in hand. and pron1ifes the itfuc or completion of it (o Joor\
as he comes to a conjunCtion \Vith Saturn ; but the Sun, being fwifter in .
n1otion than Mars, pa!fcs him, and prevents their conjunction, by fonning
the afpcCt himfclf. This indicates, that \vhatever. \Vas expeCted fron1 the
approaching conjunction of Mars and Saturn is no\v prphibited by ·the
Sun's firfi irnpediting Mars and then Saturn ;. and this 'is termed a con--
.junEliona/ or bodily prohibition. 'fhere is alfo .a. prohibition by afped.
either fextile, quartile, t~ine, or oppofition; and this happens \vhen t\VO
planets arc going into conjunCtion. Suppofe·Mars to be in feven .degrees
of Aries, Saturn in thirteen degr~es of the fan1e fign, and· the Sun in . fiv~
degr~es of Gemini; the Sun. being fvvif~er .than ~lars in his diurnal mo~
tion, \vill quickly overtake hin1,. and pafs.by tHcrfextile dexter of .Mars,
and form a fextil.

this aneans their conjunction is prohioited.
.
FRUSTRATION imports a f\vift or lightr planet approaching _to an
afpeCl:' \Vith one more flow and ponderous; but, before they can appro?ch
ncar -enough tO form that afpeCt,. the-Vv~cighty planet ·is joined tO fon}C
other, by .\vhich.the firft.afpeCl: j~ fruftrated. 'fo·infiat:lcc this, fuppote

a conjunelion \Vith Jup"iter,' but, befdre he can reach·ir, Jupiter n1eets a

CEPTION is 'vhen t\VO planets, that.are fignificators in any quefiion -
or nati\rity, are pofited in each other's dignity, as the Sun in A'ri~s, and
Mars in Leo; \Vhich is areception· by houfes, and is deetned the nloft .
po\verful and efficacious of all receptions. But reception rn~y be by ex...
change of triplicity, term, or phafe,.or by any etTential dignity ; as Venus
in Aries, ·and the Sun in 1'aurus, is a reception by triplicity, if the quef:. ,
tion or nativity happen by day. Or if Venus be ~in the twenty-(ourth
• d.egree of Aries, and ,Mars in the fixteenth degree of Gcn1ini, it is a re-
ception of terms. The ufe of thcfe .pofitions in practice is confiderable ;
for, fuppofe the event of any ·queftion required be' denied by the afpeds;
or the fignificators are in no !lfpect \vith each other; or it is x doubtful
what ·n1ay happen from a quartile or oppofitiori of ·the ~gnificators; yet,
if the -principal- fignific.ators are found in mutual rec("pt~on, the tfiing
defired .\vill fhortly corne ·to pafs, and probably 'to the £1tisfaetiop and
content of all the parties -concerned. . . r

PEREG.RIN AT ION defcribes ·a planet to be 6tuated in a fign, or in
fuch certain degrees of a fig~?, \Vher.e it has no effential dignity, either
by houfe, exaltation, triplicity, term, or phafe ; as Saturn in the tenth
degree of Aries, is peregrine ; and the Sun, in any part of Cancer, is
peregrine, having no dignity whatever in that fign. In all queftioi1s of ·
theft, it is very material ~o kno\v · the peregrine planet ; for it h<\S been
uniformly fo~n·d, by almoft every regular profeffor of this art, that the
thief··may be almoft confiantly difcovered by the peregrine planet pofited
in an angle, or in the fecond houfe. .

more affeCl:ed by it than Mercury, bccaufc the 3un npplics to, or rnovc:t
to\vards, Venus, and re~cdcs frotn Mercury, whereby.his rays affiict her
more forcibly on his nearer approach, and bccon1e \vcaker upon Mercury
by his recc{s fron1 hin1.
C A z 1~11 rcprefents a planet in the heart of the Sun ; that is, if a planet·
be only fcventcen minutes before or after the Sun, as if the Sun \Vere in
fifteen degrees thirty minutes of 'faurus, and Mercury in fifteen degrees
twenty rninutcs of the fame fign, Mercury \Vouhl then be in Cazin1i, or
in the. heart of the Sun. All authors agree that a·planet in cazimi is for-
tified thereby, and is of greater efficacy ; \Vhcreas a planet in cotnbufiion
is of a malignant nature. If the fignificator of a qucrcnt, or perfon pro-·
pounding a que!lion, be combufi, it fhe,vs him or her to be under fearful
apprchenfions, and threatened to be over-po,vered, or greatly injured, by
fome fuperior perfon. It lhould be carefully obfcrved that all planets
· may be in combufiion \Vith the Sun, but the Sun cannot be in combufiion
,vith any planet i and that cotnbufiion can only be by perfonal conjunc-.
tion in one fign, and OQt by any afpetl:, either fextile, quartile, trine, or
oppofition; the Sun's quartile or oppofite afpeCl.s arc affiiCl:ing, but they do
not c_:ombure, or render the planet cotnbufr. A planet is ahvays confi...-
dered under the fun-beams, until he is elongated feventeen degrees before
or after his body.
.
Vo1o OF CouR.st, is \vhen a planet is feparated frotn another planet,
and does not, during its continuance in that fign, form an afpetl: \Vith any
other. 'fhis tnofi ufually happens \Vith the Moon; and in praCtice, it is -
obferved that, if the fignificator of the thing propounded be void of courfe,
the bufinefs under contemplation will not fucceed, nor be attended \Vith ·
any fatisfadory or pleafing confequences.
BEsi EG 1NG, lignifies a planet lituated bct\vixt the t\vo znalevolent pla-
nets Saturn and Mars ; for inftance,. if Saturn were placed in the t\vclfth
degree of Aries, Mars in the ftxteenth, and Jupiter in the fourteenth de-
gree, Jupiter \Vould then be befieged by Saturn and Mars.

INOREASING IN LIGHT, is 'vhen a planet is feparating from the Sun,~

EXPI~AN,\~fiON of the 'fWELVE HOUSES of HEAVEN, \\'ith
DIR.EC'fiONS for ereCting tf1c HOROSCOPE.
HAVING !hewn what the elfential qualities arc, which the' planets
· and heavenly matter derive from an inherent principle of nature;
it fo1lo\VS that I fhould explain the accidental qualities they recciv'c by
' their-d.iffercnt pofitions in the twelve houfes of·heaven; for as the hea..
vens are perpetually in motion, either afccnding or dcfcending; and ftnce
it is beyond the reach of human penetration to define \vhat fiar or planet
fhall afccnd at the natiyity of children yet unborn, fo, jn reference to hu-
man ideas, it is purely accidental what dignities the p1anets fl1all acquire,
or \vhat houfes they ihall be pofited in, at the time of birdi•
•
.
That the reader may form a competent idea of \v hat is meant by the
twelve houfes of heayen, let us fuppofc the \Vhole celefiial globe, or
fphere of heaven, divided into four equal parts, by the horizon and me-
ridional line, and each of thefe into four quadrants, and each quadrant
into three equal parts, by lines dra\vn from points of feClions ~n differ~nt
parts of.the horizon and meridian, equi.difiant from each other. By; this
operation, the \vhole globe or fpherc \Vill be apportioned into t\Velve equal
parts, \vhich conftitute \vhat we call, the twelve hoz!fo.r of heaven. And
'thefe houfes, as obfervation and experienc~ abundantly !he\v, make up
that great \vheel of nature, \vhereon depends the various fortunes contin-
gent to all fublunary matters and things. ,
II
In this divifion of the heavens, the fir.fi: quadrant is defcribed by a pa-
rallel line, drawn from the point of the eafl angle, to the fouth, or mid-
lleaven; and contains the t\velfth, eleventh; and, tenth, houfes, called the
oriental, vernal, mafculin~, fangui~e, infant, quarter. , ~I'he fecond qua-
drant is defcribed by a fimilar line running from the exterior point of the
mid-heaven to the point of the \Yefiern angl~, and contain-s the ninth,
eighth, and feventh, houfes, called the tneridian, eil:ival, feminine,
youthful, choleric, quarter. 'l'he third quadrant is formed by a parallel
line, running from .the extreme- point of .the eightli houfe to the north
angle; .and contains the fixth, fifth, and fourth, houfes, called the occi-
dental, autumnal, mafculinc, melancholic, maQly, cold aod dry, quar-
ter. rfhc fourth quadrant is defcribed by a line dra\vn frotn the extren1c
point of the north angle, to the extremity of the line \vhich defcribcs
the firft quadrant, both tneeting in the·eafi: angle of the heavens, and con-
tains the third, fecond, and firft, houfes, called the northern, \Vintcrly,
feminil1c, ·phlegn1atic, quarter, the feat of old nge, decrcpidnefs, and
decay. 'fhe lines thus drawn defcribe the follo\ving figure, or horo-
f.cope, into \Vhich the .figns and planets arc feverally introduc~d, and. re-

prefented as in their.. true places in the heavens, before any queftion can be
folved or nativjty calculated·~ rrhe fpace in tne centre, were the figure

but it is gen~ra1Jy ufed to \Vrite down the day; y.ear, and hour of the day,

Thefe t\velve houfes are each diftinguifhed by tb~ir r~fped:ive figures,
and are either angular, Juccedent, or cadent. The angular houfes are
four, ·called the afcendant, mid-h~aven, or medium-creli, the feventh
houfe,. and the bottom of the·heaven; thefe are deemed t~e mofi power-.
ful and moll fortunate houfes. . The fucceeding houfes are the eleventh,
fecond, eighth, and fifth; and are ranked next in force and virtue to
the angles. '"fhe third clafs, or cadent houfes, are the third, t\velfth,
ninth, and :fixth; and are contidered of the leaft effic;tcy of them aU. But
notwithfl:anding they are divided ·into only three claiTes, or orders,
whereby their force and efficacy are efiiinated, yet is there a regular gra-
, ' . dation
...
0 ,F A 5 1~ R 0 L 0 G Y.
dation in this refpeet running through the .whole, \vhcreby on& houfc is
fubordinate to the other, from the firft to Iaft. Confidered in this order, they
fiand thus :
I IO 7 4 I I S 9 3 2 · 8 6 12
According to this rule, if \ve find two planets, equa11y firong, and
of the i:1n1e dignities, one pofited in the firfl: houfe, and the other in the
tenth, \VC judge the planet, in the firfi houfe, or afcendJnt, to have fupe-
riority over the planet in the tenth houfe; and in praCtice we infer from
fuch a pofition, that the perfon \Vhofc fignificator \Vas in the firfi houfe,
'vould get the better of his opponent, \vhofc lignificator \vas in the tenth
houfe.; but both being fo nearly equal in point of dignjty, great firug..
gles and difficulties \vould intervene, as the nature of the cafe in point
may happen to be. This rule holds good fr~m the te~th houfe to the
. feventh; the feventh to the fourth, and fo on through the 'vhole; but
it f11ould al\vays be ren1embered, that p1an~ts in angles, that is, thofe
\vhich are feated. in the angular houfes, are the nu!ft forcible and potent.
in their operation.
The firft houfe, \Vhich is denoted -
by the figure I, is called the aften-
Jant, becaufe, the point of its angle being level '"-'ith the horizon, \vhat-
cver planet afccnds from under the cart~, 1nuft afccnd upon this line, and
become vifible firfi:· in this houfe. The line upon \V hich the planets
afcend, or 1nove, is called the cufp of the houfes; and that of the afcen-
dant is generally reckoned to extend about five degrees above the earth, .
and t\venty-five degrees 'beneath, ready to afcend. But, if figns of long
afcenfions afcend, then half five degrees above the earth, and thirtcon be..
low, are its 11tmoft limits. lf figns of fhort afcenfions afccnd, then five
, degrees above the horizon, and fifty degrees below, are ufualJy allowed.
Now the quality of\vhatfoever,part of the heavens occupies or fills up the de-
grees of thts houfe, carries along \vith it the health, life, and nature_. ofevery
infant or thing that is conceived or brought forth \vithin its jurifdiet_
ion.
And hence hath this point of the heavens a faculty of attraCting or receiv-
ing the virtues of the celefiial matter that is accidentally afcending in that
part of heaven at the birth; and alfo of the planets and fixed frars in their
tranfits, and all the rays of the planets in their afpects and conjunCtions,
are attraCted into this part of heaven, in order to the fo.rmation of the
fhape, fiature, remperature of the body, quality of tl1e tnind, and all ac-
cidents and contingencies which thall bef:1ll the native's body, or health,
or life, unto his dying day; fuch a 1ympathy is. there bct\veen this pnrt
of the heavenly fran1c, and of every act and thing that is produced, or
that receives life, under it. For as the feed in the ground after it has
taken root, buds forth, and appears above ground, to the heavenly in-
telligcncers.
A ·N I L L U S T R A T I 0 N
..telligencers, after they, have fra1ned the embryo,.. and the te!Uperament
thereof, under the earth, ..give it life and being of its own, putting forth
level \vith them jufi as .they afcencf. We do not ho\vever fuppofe, that
the tetnperature and qualities of the native rvvere ·~vh9Ily .framed at the exact
titne of birth, although the fituation of the heavens at that time never
fails exactly t6 defcribe. th~m; ·we have.every reafo.n to believ.e, that the ·
ten1perature and qualities of the body., and the 'difpofition of the min~,
<1re formed in regular gradati9ns from the.conception to th~ time of birth ;
but that the birth defcribes them, is'indifputably clear, 'becaufe it carinot
l1appeh at any moment of ti1ne, in any part of the \Vorld, but it muft fall ,
even with that part of the heavenly matter afcending fron1 the lo\Ver unto
~he upper horizon, ·\vhich is interefied in, and therefore points out, thofe ·
temperatures and qualities. For any man to be fatisfied in this point, Jet
l1im ;_but note what the hature ofthis afcending point of heaven is, \Vith
all the ilars and planets pofited· therein, or having afpect \Vith 'them from
other houfes, giving each of them·their clue weight and influence, accor-
ding to their nature and ·dignity, .neither ftrained one way nor the other;
and, jnfr.as thefe are found at the time of birth, juft fo !hall be found ~he
qualities and endp,vments of that native, \vith, the principal actions and
e.vents of his··Jife, ·vvhich this point afcending takes the charge of. · And
in th.is trial \:vill the reader find more fubftantial proofs of the truth and ex-
ift:ence of Afirology, than the mofl:.acute argume~ts can infiil into his mind,
' . .
·No"v fince the. fidl: houfe, or nfcendant, gives birth and life to the na-
tive, it follo\vs that thofe houfes, which are the attendants on, and ·uphold~
ers of, life~ !hould be joined with ~t; and .as children, or the native's off-
fpring, are the upholders of life in .this ·world, and religion and learning
the grand means of upholding it into .
eternity into the other world, fo the
houfes which c9ntribute thefe bleffings to the life' already .given are joined
in an harmonious trine with the firfl: houfe, making up that three-fold
cord, \Vhich~ as Solomon faith, can net'er. be brGken. The one is a fucce-
dent houfe,·ca.lled the fifth houfe, and the other a cadent houfe, called' the ·
ninth houfe; . and to" be convinced of the effeCts of this fifth hou{e, note
the heavenly tnatter, planets, ftars, and afpetts, therein po!iteq at the time
of birth, according to the rules here laid down= and they 1ha1l tru1y repre-
fcnt the number and fiate of the natiye's offspting, and all·othcr particu-
lars relative to children, and to breeding or barren \Vomcn. So alfo exa-
mine the :!tate of the eleventh houfe; and, as that reprefents, fo {hall the
native be in refpeet of religion and fcience; for the heavenly matter, pla-
nets, Hars ·and afpetl:s therein, ihallihev: what .and how the man fhall
prove, whether wife or foolifu, devout or fchiftnatical, and. \vhat fiudy or
occupation he iliall be inclined to follo\v. 'rhefe furQith matter for grace
to work upon; ..but, as fqr grac~ itfelf, nature can have no po,ver over it;

and, amongH other ends, of the gra\·e, \vhich is the end of all men liv-

Independent of the f4culties hitherto fpecified, each-of thefe .houfes of

:tnd relations, on the "rnothcr's fide, by the.t\velfth. Hence nlfo it comes
to pafs, that by the fourth houlc are lignified houfcs and lands, anJ ail dc-
.gret's of parrin1ony left by the ~1t hcr; nnd by rhc eighth houfe arc lhe"·n

houles in h.llf-t rine to the houfc of the grave, and in oppotition to the
eighth anJ t\velfth, have a tecondary fignificarion of fifknefs and death.
Such arc the qualities nnd operations of the t\\'clvc houfes of heaven,
h1 the cornn1on courfe of n(lture ; but tht!fe qu~l irics arc fomctimcs ma-
terially altc;rcd, and changed for the better or \VOrfc, by n1c:-tns either of
the n1oon, or io:nc other of the cclcftial tnotion~ or affetlions. lc is cc:r-
tain that the n1oon circleth the earth once in every twenty-eight days ; hut
in this per·an1bulation (be neither ket!ps the fun's pathvvay in the ecliptic,
11or continues her cour(e"confiantly on the fan1e fide of it; but once in
every fourteen days !he croffes the ecliptic. alternately to her non h and
fou\h-declination ; ·and it is found hy long ·and correct obfervation, that
the point in the·heavens \vhere {he cro!fes this line, is very firong1
y af-
fected by her motion. 'rhc moon is·the great body of life and gro\Yth;
and when fhe paffes the ecliptic to the north, \vhich brings her nearer·
into this northern \Vorld, fhe then gives an extraordinary degree of fruit-
fulncfs, \\'hich \vondcrfully fl:rengthcns \Vith its influcnct: \Vhatfoevcr
happens \Vi thin the line of its jurifdic1ion. And this point. \Vherever i_
t
falls, is called the moon's north node, but is dillinguifhed in afl:rological
\Vorks by the natne of the Dragon's Head, as already explained in page
11·8. lf this point happens to afcend.in a nativity, it firengthens Jife with
a robufi and lively confiitution. If it falls in the n1id-heaven, it pron1ifes
great honour and preferment·; if in the eleventh hot}fe, profperity and
riches. If Jupiter or Venus happen to be in thefe degrees, it n1akes them
much fironger and more efficacious in their benevolent operations; bur, -if
·saturn or Mars be pofited there, it gives them, on the contrary, a fironger
inclination to prove mifchicvous and unfortunate. Wbeo the moon in-
terfed:s the ecliptic line to her fou·rhcrn declination, fhe ]eaves that point
of the heavens \vhere the crofTes it, \vhich is termed the. Dragon's Tail,
as barren to all intents and purpofes as the other \vas frui.tful. , Hence
this point afcending at a nativity, blemifhes life, and leaves a fiain upon
it; impairs honour a'ld advancen1ent in the mid-heavt!n, and \·vaftes riches
and brings adverfity in the eleventh houfe ; and it \Veakeos 3S \Veil the
benevolent aufpices of Jupiter and Venus, as the evil inclinations of Sa.
turn and Mars. Ho\V thefe circumfiances operate beyond the equinoc~
tial, experience is yet filent ; but it feems reafonabJe to fuppofe that the
Draglln's rfail is there the fruitful point, and the 1-Iead the barren point,
fince, when the mooD-, is going off from us, her influences n1ult be coming
on \Vith thcnt. ·

to the nodes, the P11rt f?f Fortune has its operations upon thefe
t\V
clve celefiial houfes. 1-l1e point \Vhich \Ve term the P<lft of Fortune,
is the difh-lncc of the moon,s plc~ce . frotn the fun's, added~ to tbe degrees
of the afcendant ; and the nature of it is, as confiant obfervatioa a{~~er­
"tains, th~t if this point falls an1ong fortunate ftars, or in ·a fortunate part
, of the heavens; theri it promifes grca~ fuccefs in health cr \\·calth, honour
or offspring, or ·any other fpecies of profperity, according as it is fe(Hed
either in the firfl:, eleventh, or fifth, houfes. or in any others. 'I he reafon
ofthis appears to be, that the Sun, Moon, and Afcendant, being the pritne
conduits lhrough vvhich the !treatn of life tlovvs, .this feat of the Part of
Fortune is the harn1·o~y of all three concentering and uniting in the i~1nu:
ads of benevolence.
·.
No"v b~fides thefe, there are yet . other qllalities accidentally nffetred,
which concern either particular perfons or times. 'Ihus the places of
Sati1rn, or Mars, or the Tail of the Dragon~ in the vernal figure, are un-
fortunate in the Highefl: degree, for the whole of that yei1r; or, if they
happen in any of the quarter figures, they portend a$iCl.ion and misfor-
tun~ for that quarter. But the places· of Jupiter and Venus in a vernal
figure are as fortunate as the others are unfortunate for the farnc titne•
'I'he places of an eclipfe of the Sun or Moon, and of the co1nets, arc alfo
fortunate· or unfortunate, ·as their fituation may be, or as perfons, coun-
tries, or fiates, may be concerned in thetn. The place of ~aturn or Mars
in a man's nativity, proves unfortunate to him all the days of his life; and
the place of either of then1 in a re~o1utiona1 figure is equally bad for that
year. But the place of Jupiter or Venus in a nativity, or in a revolutional
figure, is ahvays fortuna.te, either .for a tnan·s life-tin1c, or for the year;
as the other is unfortunate. Alfo the places of the t'vvelfth houfe, or eighth,
or fixth, as they \Vere in the native•s f~hetne, have ah.vays bad 1ignifications
unto a n1an, whenfoevcr they con1c- up upon any of his concerns. i\nd
the places of the tenth houfe, of th_e eleventh, of the afcendant, and
of the feco.nd ho~1fe, generally pron1ife as rnuch good as the other houfes
do evif u11011 all the con1mon.occafions of life;
.. . ..
Thus far \Ve have ~een the operatiotYs of the t\velve hot~fes of heaven,
as they appertain to the titne and cir:_cumfianccs of a nativity. \Ve fhall
novv- explain .their properties in that fyfiem of nature, upon \vhich the
doctrine of horary queftions is grounded. And fuch has been the induf-
try and ·indefat igabfe l_
abour of our forefathers. in bringing this fcicnce to
maturity, and in difc<?vering and difiinguiihing the partirular fignifications .
-and effed:s ofall pofitions of the planets in thefe tvv~Jve houfes of heaven,
that \Vhoever takes the pains to inform hin1felf fufficient1y of thetn, \vill ·

not he in want of competent grounds \Vhereon to j Jdgc, or give rational .
nnf\vers to c\'cry interrogation or qucfiion on the con1n1on occurrences of
life, or any contingent accidents or undertakings, with the confequcnccs
and fucccfs of them.
.
The firfi houfc bears lignification of the 1ife of man, and of the fia-
ture, colour, comp!exion form. and fhapc, of hitn \vho propounds a qucf-
tion; and, as all the vicifiitudes of nature depend upon the peri<'ds of
man's life, fo all quefiions are refolvcd by thi§ houfe, th~t relate to fick-
ncfs, hc!llth, or long life; and alfo all accidents by which life may be en-
dangered Or in1paircd ; \Vhat part of one,S days \Vill be the moft happy
and profperous; \vhethcr any abfent friend or relation be living or dead ;
or \vhcthcr any journey, voyage, or !hip at fea, will be attended vnth fuc-
cefs and fafety, or \vhethcr meet with any accident fatal to life, or dc-
frruCl:ive to the fhip. In 11rort, all quefiions, relating to circumfiances
that affect life, are to be anf\vercd from· ~he fjr!l: houfc. · In fiate-afirology,
and in eclipfes great conjunctions, appearances of comets, and other lu-
ntinous and extraordinary phenomena in the heavens ; and upon the Sun's
annual ingref'i into the equinotl:ial fign Aries, the firft houfe bears ligni-
fication of the comn1unity at large, or of that fiate, en1pire, or kingdom,
'vhere the figure is erected. Of colours, the firft houfe gives a \vh1te;
from \vhich it is to be undcrftood, that, if a planet be pofited in this houfe
that governs a light colour, and a quefiion be propounded from any party
relative to a pcrfon, n1atter' or thing, 'vhere colours arc concerned, and
this planet be the fignificator thereof. then the perfon's complexion and
drefs, or, if cattle, then their colour, f11all he of a white, pale, or lightii11,
kind; and, though this may appear ridiculous and infignificant to theun-
derfianding of fome readers, yet the faCl: fiands unfhaken in praCtice. No\v,
as every one of the t\velve houfes of heaven have tbcir fignificators, fo
have they alfo their conjigniftcator.r, \vhich have frequent operation, and
therefore ought to be confidered. A confignificator is a planet· either
fallen into conjunction, or joined in afpeet, \Vith the principal fignificator;
in \v.hich cafes, the planet either affi!ls or oppofes in the matter under con-
fideration; if it be joined with a benevolent planet, it imports good ;
but, if it happens to the contrary, it either denotes dellruCl:ion to the fub-
jeCl: of enquiry, or great difl:urbance in the .effecting of it. ~rhe config-
nificators ofthis houfe are Saturn and Aries; and, if Saturn is moderately
\veil dignified in this houfe, and in any bennvolcnt afpett \vith Jupiter,
Venus, or the Sun or Moon, it promifes a good fober conftitution of
body, and generally gives long life. If Mercury is lord of this houfe, and
\vcll dignified, the perfon fhall be a po\verful and good fpeaker.

AN ILLUSTRATION
From the fccond houfe we form judgetnent upon all queftions relating
to wealth or poverty, profperity or adverfity, and lofs or gain in any un...
dertaking that may be propounded by the querent-; and alfo concerning
move~blc good~, · money lent or e;;mployed in fpecula.tion. In fuits of
law or equity, it il1e\VS a man's friends or affifrants ; in private duels, it
defcribes the q~eren~'s (econd ; in eclipfes, it 1l1ews the~ gro\ving profpe-
rity or adverfity of a !l:ate or. people; and at the Sun's entrance. into Aries,
it. expre!fes the flrength of the empire \V here the figure is erected, in its
internal refources, in its alli.es, and in all other requifites of \Var,. or felf-~
defence. It· gives a green colour, of \vhich a fin1ilar ufe is to be made
as is defcribed in the firft houfe j and the fame obfervation. \vill -hold
good in all other houfes, in any queflions that relate to colours. ~fhe
c-;onfignificators to the fecond h..oufc are Jupiter and Taurus, for, if Jupitc~
be placed in this houfe, or is lord thereof in full dignity, it itnplies the
acquifition of an eftate or fortune; but the Sun and Mars never protnife
good in this houfe; either of them indicate difperfion of fubfiance, ac-
cording to the capacity and quality of him who propofes the queftion.
The third houfe having lignification of brethren,.. fifrers, kindred, and
neighbours; and of all inland journeys, and of removing one's manu-
facture or bufinefs ·from one place to another ; fo all quefrions that are
founded upon. any fi1bjed:s relative thereto are anf'Nered from. the pla-
nets fttuated in this houfe. Its confignificators are Mars and Gen1ini ;
which is one reafon \vhy Mars, unlefs joined \Vith Saturn, .is· nor found
fo generally unbenevolent in this houfe as in the others. If the Moon
be po(ltcd here, it is al\vays ·an argun1ent to the querift. of much refl-·
leffi1efs, travelling, and change of fituation. This is. a· fuecedent houfe
and gives a yellow, red, or forrel, colour.
'
From the fourth houfe, \Ve refolve all queftions in any way relating td
or concerning the father of the querifi. Alfo all enquiries relating to
lands, houfes, or eHates ; or to towns, cities, cafiles., or entrenchn1ents,
befiegcd; of treafures hidden in the ground, and all other quefiions re-
lating to the earth, are anfwered out of this houfe, vvhich is called. the
itn111n cali, or angle of the earth. Its confignificators are .the Sun and
Canter; and therefore if the Sun be pouted in t~is houfe, it <lenotes tlie
father of the· querift to be· of a generous and- noble. difpofition. It go-
verns the red colour.
By the fifth houfe we form all our prediCtions relative to children, and
to \Vomen in the fiate of pregnancy; alfo all queftions concerning the
prefent health of abfent fons or daughters, ~r the future health of thofe
at hotne. Enquiries relating to the real and perfonal effects of one's fa-

nu~ nnd l.~eo. ·and therefore unfortunate \Vhen occupied either by Saturn
or Mars, both of \vhich indicttte bafe and untoward children to the en-
quirer. It indicates n n1ixctl Llack and \Vhitc, or fnnguinc, col~ur.
The fixth houfe refolvcs all quefiions thrtt in any rcfpeCl: appertain to
fervants· or cattle. Alfo enquiries. concerning the flatc of a tick per-
fan, whether curable or not; the nature of the difeafe, and \vhethet of
fhort or long duration ; particulars relating to uncles and aunrs, and all
kindred on the father's fide; alfo concerning one's tenants, ficv/ards,
or the like: arc refolved by the difpofition of the·ficrrs and planets litu-
nted in this houfe. Its confignificators are Mercury ~nd Virgo; and,.
\vhen Mars and Jupiter are found in conjunCtion here, it is a fironger ar-·
gument of a good phyfician, \vhenever it comes up upon a qucfiion pro--
pounded in behalf of a patient \vho is vi6tcd by a gentleman of the fa-
<;ulty. 'fhis houfc, having no afpeCl: \vith the atcenda'nt, is al\vays.
deen1cd unfortunate. It gives a. black· or dark colour.
By the feventh houfe, \Ve are enabled to refolve· all queil:ions on love
affairs, and n1arriagc, and to defcribe the perfon of either the man or the
\Vonutn that the querifl-· \vill be joined \Vith in n1arriage. 1t like\vife
anf\vers aB enquiries of the defendant in law-fuits arid litigations ; or
concerning our public enemies in time of \Var. In thefts, it enables us to
dcfcribe the perfon of the robber, by his. fhape, ftature; Complexiot1,
~,nd coi1dition of life. In an annu:1l ingrefs, it ufually indicates \vhethcr
peace or \Var may be expected;. and, prior to an engagem~nt, betokens
\vhich fide fhall prove victorious ; it difcovers fugitives, out-hl\ved men,
and offenders efcaped fron1 jnfl:ice. The configni6catots to. this hou1e
are the ~1oon and Libra; and, \vhen Saturn or Mars is found herein, it
is deemed an unfavourable omen, produCtive of great forro\v and \vretch-
cdnefs to the querifr in any matrimonial engagetn~nt. It gives a dark
blue, black, or brov.:n, colour. ·
From the eighth houfe we folve nll qucflions concerning death, it's
tinic, quality, nature ; \V ith all matters rclaring to legacies, \vills, and
laO: tcfiaments; or \Vho !hall inherit the fortune and efiates of the de-
ceafed. Enquiries on the do\vry or portion of tnaids or \Vido\VS; in du-
els, concerning the adverf:1ry's fecond; in' la\v-fuits, relative to the de-
fendant,s fuccefs and friends; and queilions on public or private enemies,
or concerning the fub!lance and fecurity of thofe \Ve conned: ourfelves

and the like, and all quefiions rela.tive to kindred and relations on the
wife's fide; and the fame on the hufband's fid~, if the wi£e be the querifr;
and all matters relating to the arts and fciences are like\vife refolved
from this houfe. Jupiter and Sagittarius are its confignificators; for, if
Jupiter be pofited herein, it n~turally indicates a tnan of religious ·and
exen1plary n1anners, and of rnodefi carriage and behaviour; but if Sa-
tult\, Mars, or the Dragon's 1'ail, are found herein, it indicates a pedon
of atheifiica1 and irreligious principles; infiances of 'vhich, from the na-
tivities of tnany unhappy men of this caft, are almoft innutnerable. pfhe
co1ours betokened by this houfe, are green and \vhite.
- 'Ibe tenth houfe; being the medium creli, or n1ofi elevated part of the
\Vhole heavens, refolvcs all quefiions concerning kings, princes, dukes,

doms, en1pires, provinces, common wealths, · counties, cities, or focie-
fies of men, are all ~efolved fron1 the tnid-heaven. ·The confignificators
~f this houfe·are Capricorn and Mars; and, whenever Jupiter or the
Sun, be pofited herein, it gives the firongeft prefumptions of fuccefs in
whatever purfuits the querift may be in engaged in. But, if Saturn or the
Dragon's Tail afflict the fignificators in this houfe, it denies honour,
fuccefs, or preferment, to 'perfons of quality or eminence; anq to con1-
mon people it denotes vexation and dii:1ppointment in the cornmon
functions of their occupation or employment. Its colours are tpe red and
white.. .J
By the eleventh houfe '\\-·e anf\ver all enqutnes concerning friends and

the mid-heaven, fo i~ the progrefs made in all our earthly acquifitions.
The hjghe!t.degree. of man's elevation in this ·"vorld, is to that of rnajefiy, .

·to each other in concord and unanimity.
cc 'The third triplicity cotnprehends \Vorldly connctl:ions, \Vhcrhcr by
n1arriage, or conl~u,guinity, or friend{hip, and theft: holding on in the cr-
dcr of narur~, even as the progrefs is n1adc fron1 the mid-heaven to the

and nlaturity. In this ftage of 1ife, man is joined in a three-folJ tic or

in body, by the n1oO: f~1crcd of all earthly ties, marrin1ony ; ~lnt1ion ­

give a true reli(h to every enjoyment of this ·v{orld·. The n1oO: important
of thefe obligations, being marriage, is for that reafon placed under fane...
tion of the angular or fuperior houfe ;· the fecond tie, being that of blood,
claims the government of the third houfc; and the eleventh houfe,J which
perfeCts this triplicity, is fltcred to friendfhip. Thefe three hou_
fes, froa1
a_n union of nature, behold each other in a partil~Jrine, according to the·
motion of the equator.
" The fourth. and laft triplicit}r is that of paffion, \vhich comprehends
the three claffes of liuman affliction. 'fhe firft or angular houfe, of this
triplicity, in .allufion to its pofition in the lower horizon, is tcrn1ed the
dark angle, the depth of night, and bottom of heaven; the den and cave
of the fiars and planets. 1"o this houfe·is committed the firfi: order of our
woes, agreeable to the courfe of nature. 1'hefe are, infupportable mif-
fortuncs, and vifible decline of life; the firft confequences of original
fin, by \vhich man is devoted to corruption and decay, and to all the in-
firmities of nature. rrhe fecond order of human affliCtions, is tribulation,
forro\v, and difcafc; anfing either fron1 the treachery and perfecution of
cnetnies, fron1 the chains of fervitude and bondage, or from poverty and
'\vant. 'fhefe with a long train of confequent miferies, are appropriated
to the t\velfth houfe. 'fhe lafl: {hock that can be fufl:ained by human
nature, is death, the final end of all men. 1.,his is under government of
the eighth houfe, termed on this account the houfe of death. And
thefe houfes like,vife, from the·conformity of their nature and qualities,

DIItEC1"10NS for creCling the FIGURE of HEAVEN, and placing
tl;c PLANETS in the HOROSCOPE•
.
WITI-JOUT being expert :1t finding the true places of the planets
and fi"rs, nt any hour or 1ninute Fequired, either by day or nighr,
nnd \Vithout kno\ving ho\Y to difpofc them in the horofcope, fo as to
reprcient their ex~Cl: fituations in the heavens, nothing can poffibly be
known or prediCted by Afl:rology. This ncquifition, therefore, is the
next fiep to be attained; and, though it may at fir!l: appear a tafk of fome
dif11culty and labour, yet, by the help of a common Ephemeris,· \vhich
is puhlif11ed annually, and the following tables, which ~recalculated and
{ubjoined for this purpofe, the reader n1ay in a few hours become perfeCl
maiter of this very elfential part of the fcience.
The Ephemeris, of \vhich Mr. White's is the beft, is calculated to
Qlew the exaCt places of the Sun, Moon, and planets, every day at t\velve
o'clock; confcquently, by referring to it, a figure may be accurately fet
to that exact thne. But it may feldorn or never happen, that a figure
is \vantcd pr.:cifely at that hour, and therefore it is neceifary the young
praftitioner {bould kno\v how to reCtify the daily motions of the planets,
by the nunlber of degrees they move every twenty-four hours, fo as to
ereCt the figure, and introduce the true places of the figns and planets,
\vhenevt:r required. This, by referring to the Ephemeris for the !l:ations
of the planets at noon, may be done extremely eafy, by the common
procefs of figures; but, that every reader may be enabled to do it
\vithout trouble, I have fubjoined an eafy table, whereby the plJnetary
111otions are reduced to hours and n1inutes, and may be found for either
day or ntght.
It is like\\'ife of importance to know the planetary hours, that is, the
hour in which ·every planet has its particular rule; for hereby \VC are
enab)ed to determine various points, and to draw many ufeful conclu-
fions, either in our judgn1en t on nativities, or horary quefiions. In
gathering herbs for n1edicinal purpofes, the planetary hour is certainly
of confequence, ho\Vevcr n1odern refinement might have exploded
the idea. In nature the moft fimple ren1edies are frequently found to
produce the n1oll: falutary effects; and in earlier ti~11cs, when the ·art of
phyfic \Vas leis obfcured, nnd praCl:ifed n1ore froin motives of benevo-
lence, the world \Vas lefs affliCted \Vith difeafe, and the period of 11um:in
life lefs contraclcd. 'fhe Suprerne Being, in his abundant tnercies to
mankind, has furniilied arnplc ren1edies in the laboratory of nature, \vere
nature but adhered to, for the removal of every curable diforder incident

tt? the humaiJ frame; for, notwithfianding all t~e parade of compound
nledicines,-the art ~f phyfic does not confift fo much in ,prepari'ng the
' remedy, as in knowing ho\v -!o apply it. Hence it happens,, that old
\~on1en, ~vithotit education or experience, by the help of a limp1e herb,
gathered in the planetary hour, in.which hour it imbibes its greateft degree
of ftrength and fpecific virtue, will fometitnes perforn1 very extraordinary
cures, in cafes where gentltlmen of the faculty are abfolutely at a lofs
how to treat them*. The planetary hours always begin at fun-riling.
and each planet governs in rotation, .according 'to the following table:

To underO:and the preceding table, the reader rnufi recollect that \vc:
have already affigned to each planet his refpctl ive rule over every day in
the week; for inflance, the Sun governs Sunday, the Moon Monday,
Mars Tuefday, Mercury Wcdncfday, Jupiter "fhurfday, Venus Friday,
:lnd Saturn Saturday. Each planet begins his rule t.hc n1oment the Sun
:~ppears above the horizon; and coqtinucs for one planetary hour; at the
ex pir.ltion of \vhich the next p1anet j n orcler. co01 mcnccs his ruIc, and co:1 -
tinucs the fan1c portion of titne, and then the third planet in order
governs, and fo on through the \vbolc ~·eek. So that1 if I \vant to knov1
\vhat Blanct rules in any particular hour of the daY. or night, I t~ke the
planet \vhich begins rule that day, and reckon in order till I find it. f'or
cxan1ple, on Sunday the Sun rules the firfi hour, Venus the fecund,
Mercury the third, the Moon the fourth, Satllrn the fifth, Jupiter the
fixth, Mars the feventh, the Sun the eighth, Venus the ninth, and fo
on through the \\'hole day and fucceeding night, till the Sun rifcs again;.
by \vhich mode of reckoning it will be uniformly found, that each
planet \vill begin its governn1ent at ~un-r~fing, ~ccording to the order
above defcribed, to the end of the world. This alfo evidently nppe3rs
by the table; for if \Ve begin with the firfl: column, and reckon t1o\vn
the whole tvventy-four hours, we find the Moon begins her government
nt tbe top of the fecood column on Monday morning, \vhen the Sun
rifes. If we reckon do\vn the fecond colutnn in the fame order, we find!
Mars begins his rule at the top of the third column, ~ on Tu~fday
1norniog. So the planets •wvill be found to obfcrvc the fan1e reguiJr
order throughout alJ the other columns, \vhich take in the bouts of;
every day and~ night' throughout the \Veek; and for· the enfuing \Veek:
the table begins ngain in the fame order, and \Yill fo continue, \Vithout
~1teration or error, to the end of tin1e. By referrin.g t~ the figures, .
which reprefent the refpeB:ive hour of every day and night throughout
of compaffion, c:~dminifier balm to the bleeding-iffues of their affii8:cd brethren. . The. many:
invaluable d1fcoveries bteJy added to the Pharm(lcopreia, both from the vegetable and mincl"dl
world~, are {hong arguments of the neceffity of regular practice, and of profeffional education, in .
forming the phyfician. But were the bulk of thefe gent)em~n to confu)t a little more th:! ple1netary *
influences, both on vegetable and .mineral fuhfiances, and apportion them in their prdcriptions.
according to the nature anJ confiitution of the patient, uniformly confulting the effeCts of Saturn .~
nnd the .l'v1oon in each crifis and critical day, I am perfuaJed that more imm~dbte relief, in moft
cafts \vhere nature is not too f.'lr exhauilcd, might be afforded to the fick and Janguilhing patient• .
Surgery too, which, like a guJrdian angel, llcps forward to alleviate the perilous accidents of the un.
fortun.1te, would gain much impr0vement by the li~c confiderations. Itis not, therefore, the regular-
bred praclitioners of either phyfic or furgery that the author means to arratgn, but thlt baneful
defcription of cmpirics and qu~cks, who now pervade the kingclom, and like a fwarm of locufts fron1
the Eafr, prey upon the vitals of mankind. Thefc mon{ters in the fhape of men., with hearts .
callous to evay fentiment of compaffion, have only fees in view. Governed by this fordid principJt:·, ,
they fport with life, unmoved amidft the bitter anguilh and piercing groans of the dcfpnoding .

the week, the reader may always fee what planet governs in that hour,
as its cha~acter is pl.1ced in the fame line \Vith the figure, For example.
fu ppofe I· want to· know what planet. rules the fifth hour on Sunday
morning-! look down the fidl: column of the table, over which is
placed Sunday planetary hour, and at the-fifth hour I find Saturn governs.
Again, fuppofe it be ~equired to k,now what planet governs the ninth
hour on Friday ~fternoon-look down the column over which Fr-iday
planetary hour is printed, and in the ninth hour it will be feen that
l\tlercury governs. Or if it be aik.ed, what planet ~ules ihe nineteenth '
boor on Wednefday night? Look down the column over \Vhich Wed...
nefday planetary hour is· prefixed, and at 19, which figoifies the nine-
teenth hour, or the feventh hour after the Sun is fet,_ it will be found
that MJrS governs; and fa for any other -
time required.
But a planetary hour not agreeing with the common ..divifion of time~
and being peculiar to aftronon1y and aftrology only, \Ve lhall explain it
n1ore fully. ']he planetary hours are reckoned frotn the tin1e of the
Sun•s ri11ng to its fetting, \vhich fpace of time is divided into twelve
equal parts, and thefe are termed the t\velve planetary hours of that day._
1~ hen the time frotn the Sun's fetting to its rifing the next n1orniog is
in the f1tne rnanner divided in~o t\velve equal parts, and thcfe confbtute
the t ""t! Ive p1anet~ ry bours for that night.. Hence it is obvious, that
when the days are ·fbort, a planetary hour does not cqnfift of above forty
n1in utes, more or lefs, according to the twelfth part of the whole time
from the Sun's rifing to its fetting; .and, the nights being then long, a
planetary hour by night may confifl of an hour and ten or twenty minutes,
or rnore; and fo,vice 'Verfo \Vben the days are long, and the nights fhort ~
fo that the duration of planetary hours, both by day and night, are con-
tinually varying, and never agree with the common mea!ure of titne,
except on thofe tV'Io days in every year \¥hen the Sun enters Aries and
Libra, and then equ~l night and day is difpenfecl to all parts of the world.
Tbrefore, to enable the reader to find the length of the planetary hours
\Vithout the trouble of calculating, I fubjoin the following table, by
vJh~ch they may be found, both night and day, for ever.

time from the Sun's rifing to its fetting be only fix hours, the p1anetary
hours that day \vould be each thirty tninutes long, ns fpeci fied in the
fecond colun1n, and the planetary hours the night follo\ving \\'Ould be
each one hour and thirty rninutes long, as exprefit:d in the third column.
Again, fuppofe theJinle bet\veen the Sun's rifing 3nd fettiog be thirteen

To find the true place of each planet, at any hour \vhen \Ve. h~ve occa-
fton. to ereCt a figure, it only requires to turn to the Ephemeris for the
planets' places at noon; thofe being found, note how many degrees or
n1inutes they anovc in the zodiac by t\velve o'olock the next day, or fron1
noon the preceding day; and then, by the help of the foregoing table, it
\Vill be feen ho\V 1nany degrees, minutes, or feconds, they move in an.
hour. For exan1ple, fuppofe a planet moves one degree in t\venty-four
hours, ho\v far does it move in one hour? At the top of the firfi colun1n
is the figure 1, and in the fame Ji~e of the fecond column is 2 n1inutes
nnd 30 feconds; \vhich !hews, that, if a planet be twenty-four hours in
moving one degree, it then n1oves at the rate of two minutes and 30
feconds in an hour. Or fuppofe. a planet only moves t\VO rninutcs in
t\venty-four hours; lqok into the firfi column of the table for the figure 2,
oppofite, in the fecond colutnn, fiand 5 feconds, \vhich !hews, that if a
planet moves t\~ro minutes in twenty- four hours, it then n1oves only five
' feconds in an hour. Again, if a pPanet's diurnal 1notion he thirteen
n1inutes, whnt is it~ hourly motion? Look into the firfi colutnn for 13,
and oppofite is 32,30; \Yhich indicates, that, if a planet n1oves thirtcc:n
rninutes in twenty-four hours, it tnoves thirty-t\vo feconds and thirty
thirds in an hour, The {acne rules hold good for the motions of all the
plJnets; it cnufi, ho\vever, be carefully obfcrved, (hat, if the diurnal
motion of any planet be in degrees, then you n1ufl. enter the firft colun1n
of the table, under the denomination of degrees, and the fecond column
\Vith minutes and Jeconds; ~ut, if the diurnal tnotion of the· planet be
only in minutes, then you mull: begin to reckon ·in the firft colurhn only
with minutes, aud·i n the fecond column with feconds and thirds. ~his
is indicated by the initial letters placed over each coluJnn, which fignify
degrees or minutes in the firfi. column, and, in the fecond, degrees and
OJinutes, n1inutes and feconds,· feconds and thirds. Then fuppofe a
planet moves one degree and ~hirteen minutes in t\venty-four hour~, ho\V
far does it move in an hour ? Refer to the table, and fay,
One degree in 24 hours is 2 n1in. 30 fee. o thirds per hour.
Thirteen n1in. in 24 hours is o min. 32 fee. 30 thirds. ,
Anf\ver 3 2
And thus · any quantity of a planet's diurnal 1notion may be reduced to
time in the fame n1anner.
But as no figure can be erected without the help of an Ephemeris, and
tables to !hew the Sun's place in each of the twelve figns, unlefs by
entering into long and tedious calculations, I lhall therefore infert in
this place the two pages of White,s Ephetneris for June, 1784, ::1nd the
tables above-n1entioned, with an explanation of the whole. ·

~ - It is no uncommon thing "lith many readers, and particularly the~e
not very converfant ~vith figur.es,~· to. pais over all tables as intricate, or
difficult to underfiand. ~ But, fince no inforrnation can be obtained in the
praCtical part of~hjs fci~nt~· without the1n, it is proper to caution all my
readers againfr this much-mifiaken no~ion ; for ev~ry perfori \Vho can 1nake
ufe-of a Ready Reckoner or J;ra4er's Sure Gt1ide, -tnay \Vith equal eafe un-
derfiand all the tables calculated for this Vvork.
The u~'e ofthe Ep~emeris, in fettini -a figure, is ~o point ~u·t the places
of the planets at n~on, viht?neyer' required. For this purpofe, we refer
to the ·gi_
ven aa~ C?f. ~he 'month, in..lthe firfi. c,olu~n 9\the right-hand ~age,
an.d oppofite to -tt, IH the fecond cohunn, 1s the Sun s place or long1tude

th~ough the. \V hole, Ta~le, ~re the places of the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter,
Mars, Vehus, and. Mercury, as fpecified at the top of each difiinCl: cv-
lumn; 'an.d' 'thefe -are true places of the Sun, l\1oon, and planets)
every ·day thrciughout the year, prec1fely at tvvelve o'clock at noon.
Therefore, if the figure.. be ereCted before.~pat ti.,.ne, the diurnal tnotion
of the planets rnuft be deducted in .hours and minutes, in proportion to
·the rate they move· at pe~ hpur; but, if it be ereCted after noon, then fo
m any hours-or .minutes inufr·be added as will bring them to the precife
tin;e.of ereB:'ing ·the ·figure.. '

iThe twelve Tables of I-Ioufes are next to be referred to ; and thefe are
calct~l~ted to fh..ow \Vhat degrees of each ~g!1 _pofrefs the cufps .of t_he
twelve houfes of heaven \vhen. the figure 1S ereCted. They begu1 \~1th
the Sun's entrance into the ·fign Aries, and ilio\V his progrefs through
each degree of tpe·tw_
elve figns of tbe zodiac.
Now let it be required, by w~y of example, to erea a figure for Fri-
day, the 11th day of June, - ~7~4, at 11 h. 24 min. A.M. that is, at
' twenty-four minutes pail: eleven o'clock in the morning. To do this, 1
refer'· ro the firfi column of the . right-hand page of the Ephemeris for
June, ana oppofite the i'I th day of the month, in the recond column,
"\vhich' has 0's longitud~ 'printed .at the top, l find 2t. 3· 27, with the
fign n prefixed at the fide pf the firfr range of figures. .This indicates,
that the :Sun, at t\velve o'clock that day, i.s in twenty-one degrees three "
mibutes · and twenty-feven · fecond~ o(' Gemini; but the 'minutes and
fec~qds, ' \vh.en ~efs than thirty, are rejetted without fenfible error, and,
\vhen mor~ tpan thirty, have as many added as \Vill Inake them tlp eve.n
degrees. -I therefore turn to the Table of Hon1es, and in the pag~ enti-
tled .5'o1 in Genzini I look for the column that ·has the fign ~ at the
top, ·lvhich is the third ; I feek for 2 1 degrees, and in the coiumn on

sh. 21 min. 'l'hc hours and minutes thus found are ·unifonnly to be
added to the. time or hour of the day \vhen the figure is ereEtcd, un·
}efs it be prccifcl.y at noon, in which cafe, a~ \ve ha\'e before obfcrvcd._
the places of the Sun, planet~, and figns, arc to be fet do•.vn exatlly as
they are found in the Ephemeris, and "fables of Houfe's. But, the prc-
feht fiaurc being creCl:cd jult thirty-:lix tninutes before t\velve o'clock, 1
am to
0
add this tirne, reckoning frotn noon the preceding day, to the
above 5 h. 2 I tnin. and from thefe t\vo fums added together I fubtract
t\vcnty-four hours, and the retnaindcr \vill give the degrees of each of the
t\velve figns, as then· pofited upon the cufJ.Js of the horofcope; thus:

I feek this remainder in the table of houfes entitled Sol in Gemini, in
the column of Tinujro1n Noon; but, not finding 4· 45, I take the neareft
nun1ber ·to it, which is_ 4· 46; and oppo!ite this number, in the next
column on the right, I find I 3 degrees of Getnini in the tenth houfe,
\vhich is denoted by xoth Houfe n, at the top of the column; and there·
fore 1 place thirteen ~egrees of G~mini in the line or cuip of the tenth
houfe of the figure. This done, I refer to the next column in rotation
to the right haild, an~ in the fame line \vith the t\venty-one degrees of
Gemini I find 20. 7, ahd looking to the top of tht= colun1n, find it to
~e t\vcnty degrees and fevep tninutes of the fign $' \Vith 1 1 Haufe over,
and therefore I place t\venty degrees feven minutes of Cancer upon t~e -
cufp of the eleventh houfe. I follo\v the fan1e rule \Vith the. next co-
lumn, where I find 21. 48;. and looking to the top find the fign Q.,- 1 2
Houfe, and accordingly place twenty-one degrees. thirty-eight minutes
of Leo upon the cufp of the twelfth houfe in the figure. 1'hen I refer
to the next column, where I find 17. I, and at the top the \vord Afcen..
dant with the fign ~ prefixed, which figntfies that feventeen degrees one.

fig~1 :e: belo\v tW, an~ 2 l-Iou{e at the top, which lho\vS that ni!1e degrees

forty-etght minutes of Scorpto are to be placed on the cufp of the -third

So that the tenth houfe is oppofite to _
the fourth, and the fourtn to
the 'tenth;· the eleventh to the fifth, and the fifth to the ·elev_enth; and
fo through the \Vhole; the ufe 9f which·· is, that, if on:the. cufp of the
tenth houfe yqu find the fign Aries,. then on the cufp of the fo.~rth houfe·
·you muft place the fign Libra, and, whatever degree and'"tninute of Arie~
pofftffes the cufp of·the tenth houfe,.the fatne degree and ~inute I of Li-
bra muft be placed on the cufp of the. fourth houfe; and the fame rule
mufr be obferved vvith all the other houfe.s and figns, which is univerfal, '
and ever holds true. For example, in the prefent figure, we have placed
13 degrees of 11 on · the ·cufp of the tent~ houfe; now J~ being .oppofite
to n., and the fourth.houfe to tpe ten~h, I therefore place ·13 degrees o(
t on the cufp of the fourth houfe. ·Upon·· the cufp of the, eleventh
houfe, 20 degrees 7 minutes of Cancer being ·already placed, and the-
.6fth houfe being oppofite to the eleventh, and ·V'i oppofite $, 1 there-
fore put 20 degrees: 7 minutes·of w upon the tufp _
of the fifth houfe.
T~e cufp pf the twelfth houfe being alfo occupied '\Vitb 2 I degree.s 38.
minutes .of Q:, 1 place· 2 I degrees 38 m~nutcs· of the oppofite fign =·
upon the cufp of tpe fixth..houfe, which ts oppofite the twelfth. Upon·
the )cufp of the firfr houfe, or afcendant, ther~ is t 7 degrees 1 minute of
J'!l', and the feventh houfe being oppofite to the firfr, and the fign * to
JW, I accordingly place r 7 degrees 1 !llinute of * upon the cufp -or 1ine~
of the feventh houfe. Having alfo placed 9 degrees I 5 minutes of -!:::'
upon· the cufp of the fecond ~oufe, I place 9 degrees I 5 minutes of the
oppofite fign r upon the cufp of the eighth houfe, \vhich is oppofite to
the fecond. I then refer to the third houfe, \}pon the cufp of which are
placed 7 degrees 48 minutes of tn ; and the oppofite houfe~ to this being,
, ' · ·· the
,
0 .F A 5 T R 0 L 0 G Y. .s5
the t~inth, nnd tS the oppofite fign, 1 place i degrees 48 tninutcs of
.Taurus upon the cutp of the ninth houic. And thus the t\velvc houfes
arc cotnplctc:ly occupietl \Vith the t\velvc figns of the zodiac, \Vith the
degtecs aicending at tbc pracife titne of erecting the figure.
I-Iaving fo far fuccecded,. the next thing is to place the Suu, l\1oon, and
. planets, in ~he figure, agreeable to their pofition at that time in the heavens,
and this is nllo to be done by the help of the right-hand page of the Ephe-
meris. 1~or infiance, I again refer. to the I 1th of June, b.n~ oppo!ite
to it, in the column..of the 0's longitude, I find hitn jn 2 I degrees 3
tninutcs and 27 {econds of Getnini that day at noon . But as the figure is
ereCted thirty-fix minntes before noon, I note ho\v far the Sun has moved
fron1 noon the preceding day, and find · he has gone at the rate of fifty-
fcven Ininutes, \vhich gives a difference of one minute and t\venty-feven
feconds for the tin1e before noon, as follo"'S_:

Thus I find the Sun's place at t\venty-four minutes after eleven o'clock,
in 21 degrees 2 n1inutes of Gen1iui; \V hich fign being then upon the cufp
of the tenth houfe; I therefore place the Sun in that houfe, clofe to· the
fign, \Vith thefe degrees and minutes. I then refer to the Ephemeris for .
the 1\t1oon's place, and in the column of her longitude, oppofite the 11th
day of the 1nontb, I find her in 5 degrees 46 minutes pf r, at noon; but,
to kno\v her place thirty-fix minutes before, I note ho\v much fl1e goes
in an hour, ~nd find her motion to be 35 minutes; then I deduCt 21 tni~
nutes for the time before noon, and find her true place to be, i11. 5 hours
2 5 minutes of Ar..ics, \vhich I accordingly· ~nter before the cu~p of the
eighth houfe ~]o{~ to that figu. I then refer .t~ the Ephen1erts fo! the
planet ~' and ·on the I 1 th of June I find him tetrograde in 22 degrees
53 minutes of the fign Vf, \Vherefore I place hitn under Capricorn, in the
fifth houte, \Vith an R prefixe~, to denote that he is-retrograde.-! refer
to the Ephemeris in like tnanner for the planets Jupiter, 1\.fars, Venus,
and Mercury, \vhich I alfo enter iu thei..r proper places in the figure, viz.
Jupiter in 7 degrees 36 minutes pf *, l\1ars . in 27 degrees I inin\lte of
s, Venus in 5 degrees 5 minutes of n, and Mercury .retrograde, in ~+
degrees 2 minutes of the f~me .
figu.
The planet~ being thtlS entered, I next refer to the top of the fecond
page of the Ephemeris, for the coluh1n of the l\Joon's node, 'vhich \Ve
term the Dragon's Head, and 1 find on the 7th day of the month it is .

·in four degrees of Pifces; but, as it moves hackward about three minutes
per day, I deduB: eleven 1ninutes, to bring it to the 1 rth of June; and
its place 'viii th~n be in four degrees 8 minutes of Pifccs; 1 'therefore
enter it in the fixth houfe, under the fign * ; and, as the place of the·
Dragon's Tail is ahvays oppofite to the Dragon~s Head, 1 place it in the· .
fame degrees of the oppofite fign, which_
in this figure falls in the twelfth
houfe, which 1s oppofite to the fixth. · .
TQe figure is now entirely con1pleted, e~cep.t putting in the Part of
Fortune, which is the difiance of the l\1oor1's pl11ce I from the Sun's added
to the afc~ndant. The tnode of determining this has com~only be~n by
firft finding the true place of the Moon, then the true place of the Sun;
then fubtraB:ing th.e Sun's place from the ~1oon's, and adding to the re-
mainder the degrees of the afcendant; and this, if taken in the fphere of
the Moon, gives the place of the Part of Fortune. But, a much more
correct n1ethod having been adopted by the learned Placidus, V\re recom-
mend it in preference to any ot~er; it i~ a~ follows: Firfi: note the fign
and Q.egree on the afcendant, and enter w1th the fame figtl and degree in
the Table of Oblique Afcenfions calculated for this work, in the latitude
wherein you erect your figure~ and in the common angle of meeting you
wi_
ll find the number required. Then enter the fame table with the de-
gree of the Sun, a!1d fitbtract the oblique afcenfion of the one from the
other, and the remainder will be the Sun's difiance fron1 the +afceudant.
Then take the riO'ht afcenfion of the Moon~ and enter the Table of the
Moon's Right Afcenfion, under the degrees of uorth or fouth latitude, as
fhe then happens to be; and, ~rhen the Moon's right afcenfion is found~
fubtratl it from the Sun's diftance from the aicendant, and the ·re1nainder
will be the right afcenfion ·of the Part of Fortune. For example, in
the figure before us: deg. min.
The fign ~ has t 7 deg. I min. upon the afcen-
dant, the oblique afcenfion of which is I 61 33
The oblique afcenfion of the 0 (both being in
- northern-figns, nothing is added) is 47 43-
Which being fubtraB:ed from the others, remains I r3 so
Then fubtratt the right afcenfion of the Moon, 2 52
.
Retnains l I I sB
Which is the right afcenfion of the Part of Fortune. I refer for this
fum to the .firft colu~n of the preceding Tables of Houfes, under A. R.
t In this. operation always ohfC"rvet that, if the fig-n afcending be fouthern, and the fign in
whach the Sun i~ pofited be north~rn, then add the whole circle of the zodiac, or three hundred
and fixty degrec

fho\vs that this fiar ' is \vithin two degrees of the cufp of the fourth

and in the 'I'able of Fixed Stars I find the Head of Andromeda jn r I [. 20,
I therefore place it jufr 'vithin the cufp of the eighth houfe. Upon the
medium creli, I find II I 3· o, and io the table I find the eminent fixed
fiar RigeJ, of the. firfi lnagnitude, in II •3· s6 ; I therefore place hiln in

cufp of the eleventh houfe. Upon the cufp of the t~velfth is Q. 21. 38,
and in the Table I fiud the fiar Hydra in Sl 24. I 2, and therefore I enter
him in twenty-four degrees of lJeo in the t\velfth houfe; and thus I have.
collet1ed the pofitions of all the planets and eminent fixed fiars, as they
.flood in the heavens at t\venty-four n1inutes paft eleven o' clock, on _I.'rt-
day the eleventh of June, 1 784. As the fixed fiars move on their lon-

'may be kno\vn at any given tin1e, pafi or to cotne. ~

lo\ving columns fiand o. 16. 40, \vhich 1ho\vs that Aldebaran has moved
fixteen nlinutes and forty feconds in t\venty years; and, this fum being
deducted from fix degrees (orty-five minutes, his prefent place in Gemi-
ni, fhows that twenty years ago he \vas pofited in fix degre~s eighteen mi-
nutes and t\venty fecouds of this fign. This rule 'vill hold good for any
other fiar, or for any number of years; only obferving, that, jf it be re-
quired to know the fiar's place t\venty years hence, then the fix teen minutes
and forty feconds mufi be added ; and fo in proportion for any other length
of tin1e. But, fince the aipetts of the planets at the titne of ereCling th~

Suppofc it \verc required to find the poles elevation of the eleventh,
third, t \Vclfth, and fccond, hou{es, for the latitude of fifty-three degrees.
1 enter the Table at No. 53, under the title Afccndaut, and right againfi
it I find, under the eleventh anti third houfcs, t\venty-four degrees thirty
minutes, \Vhich is the pole's elevation ; and under the tv1elfth and fecond
houfc~ I find forty-t\vo degrees t\venty-fix minutes, \vbich is the poles
elevation for the t\velfth and fecond houfes; and in this manner they may
be found for any other latitude.
..
No\v, by kno\ving the poles elevation for thefe houfes, a figure of the
..heavens may be erected for the uativity of any perfon born \vithin thirty-
one to fixty degrees of latitude. For example, fuppofe a per.fon born
in fifty-three degrees of latitude, on the firfi of June, 1 784, at thirty-
fix tninutes paft five o'clock in the afternoon, \vhat would be the de-
grees of each fign upon the cufps of the t\velve houfes? To know this,
turn to the Ephetneris for the Sun's place on the firfi of June, and it
\vill be found in eleven degrees thirty minutes of Gemini; then refer to
the Table of Houfes for.the Sun in Getnini, and in the colun1n under
· 1oth Haufe, I look do\vn for I 1. 30, but, finding no minutes, I look into
the colutnn upon the left hand under Time from Noon, \vhere I find
4 h. 38 min. the' next arch of time being 4 h. 42 tnin utes, I divide
the difference for the thirty minutes, which makes the true time 4 h. 40
min. To this I add 5 h. 36 min. the time after noon, \Vhich .added to-
gether maKe 1 o- h..I 6 min. which I ·feek iu ·the column of tin1e from
noon ; and in the ne-xt ·colutnn on the right hand 1 find the figure 2,
\V·ith 1o ·Houfc ~ at the 'top, \vhich denotes that tvvo degrees of Virgo
are at that time upon the cufp of the tenth houfe. Then, in order to
kno\v \Vhat fign~ poifefs the other houfcs, I look into the firfi column of
the Table, with A. R. at the top, "'hich fignifies the right afcenfion of
time, and even w-ith the above nutnber 1 find r54· o, \Vhich declares that
to be the right afcenfion of ·the ·mid-heaven. To thefe 15~ degrees I
add 30, \vhich make together 184; theti I refer to the above table for

which is the pole·of the eleve_

feek 304, vrhich I find in the column under Capricorn, and even \Vith it,
in the firft:' column of degrees, 1 find 2 I ; but, by equating as before for
the odd minutes in the Sexagenary Tables, I find that twenty-one degrees

In this piain, cafy, and obvious, manner, ·tnay ·the fituation of the
heavens be found for auy latitude \vhatever. But, to make jt tnore eafy,
it is necefi:'lry to explain \V hat \\'e mean by th.e poles po(ltioqs, .,and the
c~uations of time. If \Ve itnaginc t\velve -great circh:s, one of'"hich is
the meridian of any given place, to jnter!eCl: ~ach other ii1 the t\VO poles
of the earth, and to cut th~ equator in every fif~eenth d~gree, they \vill be
divided by the poles into twenty-four f~tnicircles, which divide the equator
into t\venty-four equal part&; and as the earth.turns on its axis, the planes
of theie femicirclcs corne fuccefiively after one another every hour to the
Sun. And, as in an hour of: time there is a revolution of fifteen degrees
of the equator, in a minute of time there \V ill be a revolution of fifteen
minutes of the equator, and a fecond of' time a revolution of fifteen
feconds. 'I'hus, to every place fifteen degrees eafl:\vard from any given
meridian, it is noon an hour fooner than on that meridian, becaufe their
' I '
meridian comes to the Sun an .hour foouer. And to all places ·f~fteen de-
grees \Vefi\vard, it is an hour.late.r, becaufe th~ir mctidian comes au hour
later to the Sun ; and fo on, every fifteen degrees of tpotion caufing an
hour's difference. of time. . Therefore they,- who have noon an hour later
than \Ve, have their meridian, that ~s, their longitude, fifteen degrees
wefi,vard from us; and,they, who have noot) an hour fooner tha 1 we,
have tHeir meridian 'or longitude 'f1fteeh degrees eafr\'Vard from ours; and
(o, for every hour's difference ~(time, fifteen degrees dffference oflongi-
tude. And, as we fhall have fl:equent oc~J!.[Qn to equate the motions of

Thus by proper attention to the tules and direCtions preceding, tnay'
any perfon, though of fmall abilities, erect the horo(cope, and in traduce
the figns, planets, and ftars, therein,. at any given time required. This
is indifputably a confiderable advancement in the practical part of the
~cience of Aftrology; though it mufi be owned, that the mere know-
ledge of thus defcribing and arranging the planets in the horofcope, wit~­
out we add unto i~ ~he ability of defining, frorrt fo]De certain and expe-
rienced rules, the 1neaning, effeB:~, and influences, of therp, under what·
ever afpeB:s or fitua~ions they may be found; can be of but little or no
advantage. To make this apparent, let me,. bu-t afk the reader to turn to
the foregoing figure.. of the heavens, ereB:ed for the I 1 tb of June
1 j84, and def~ribe the natural meaning and indications of the iigns and
planets 've have taught hitn to place therein? A compliance w.ith this
he fit1ds impoffible;· not having either by theory or praCl:ice attained to
them. As a key to this important acquifition, I !hall novr lay do\vn
fome experienced rules and aphori(ms, 'vhich iliould be attentively con-
fidered, and thoroughiy underftood, before any further advances a1·e made _
in-the fiudy. I ihall therefore begin \vith th~ following General Axioms.
, · 1. That
I
,
' .-
0 F A S T R , o ·L 0 G Y.
1. That every fign, planet, and fixed finr, hath a fpecific and particu-
lar effcC1 in one houfe, or part of the heavens, diffc1 ent from \vhat they
have in another. ~
II. That the Sun by hirnfelf in any houfe of a figure bath one effea,
the 1\1oon another, Saturn another, Jupiter another, and fo on through
the 'vholt;. And that this holds good alfo in refpetl: to the figns and
fixed fiars.
III. ·That, as a planet hath one effetl: i11 himfelf, fo hath he another
'~hen joined in conju_nttion \Vith. another planet; and by a fextile, quar-
tile, trine, and oppohtion. , ·
IV. That the qua~tile and oppo1ition of Saturn a~d Mars have one ef-
feCt; and the qua~tile and oppofition o~ J~tpiter and Venu.s a~1other.
1
•
V. That a planet hath one fpecial or fpecific effetl: when lord of the
firfi: houfe or afcendant; another \vhen lord of the {econd houfe; another
\vhen lord of the third houfe; and, \vhen lord of the fourth, ftill ano-
ther; and fo on through all the t\velve houfes of heaven. ·
.
VI. That \vhatever point of the heavei1s retains the Sun as fignificator
in any nativity retains a folar force and influence in refpet1 to that native
as long as he lives. '"fhe fame rule extends to the fi1oon, and to Sa-
turn, Jupiter., l\'1ars, Venus, &c. \Vherefore the horofcope or afcendant
in every gcniture barb and doth contain a radical influence over the na-
tive's life; the tnid-heaven over his aCl:ions and occupation; and each of
the other hou{es O\ er thofe particular evez1ts and viciffitudes to \vhich
it refpeCl:ively appertains. . _
VII. That the fame point in· the heavens, 'vhich in one nativity is the
place of Sun, may in another nativity be the place of Saturn, Jupiter,
Mars, Venus, Mercury, or the lVIoon. -
-
VIII. That every agent, aCting by itfelf, acts only according to its O\Vll
peculiar fonn and virtue.
IX. That every patient fuffers according to its own proper nature; and
that whatever is received is received only in proportion to the capacity of
the receiver.
"' X. That the fame, al\vays exifiing, muft always \vork the fame effect
in or upori the fame tubjeet. Thefe· being premifcd, \Ve !hall confider

GENERAL EFFEC1"S PRODUCED BY THE ASPECTS.
..
OF THE CONJUNCTION.
.
The conjunaion of Saturn and Jupiter Chews inheritances of hQufes
and lands, poffeffions, and many worldly profits arifing from cultivating
the earth, and tillage, if Mars atlliEl: not, nor the evil beams of Sol. If
Jupiter is fignificator, the 'native is miflrufiful. ,
Th~ conjunaion of Saturn and Mars flle\vs much evil, the native will
be affiiaed, and vexed, !hall undergo n1any troubles, and go through
great difficulties. lf you would kno'v the caufe of the good or evil, you
mufr confider the hou!e in \\~hich the configuration happens, and 'vhat
houfe the configurated planets are lords of, and accordingly you may
nearly fpeak to the particular matter or accident, be it good or evil ; for
things are much varied according· to the diverfit~ of pofition and do-

danger of houfes being burnt, the native likely to be · cheat~d, to receive
much detrin1ent, and, it may be, lofe all and become poor ; e~cept a
fortunate planet be pofited in the fecond houfe.
The conjunClion of Saturn and Venus fhev1s one.libidinious, and that
he fhall marry a ~~o111an \Vholly of an oppofite temper and difpofition to
bimlelf,.get difhonour among \Vomen.ldnd, be unhappy in marriage, and
. lead, by reafon of his wife, a very difcon.{olate life. lf Venus be iignifi-
catrix, file is much afflicted; but, if Saturn, then ~he conjunction isbe-
neficial ; and this is to be obferved in fimilar cafes.
, .
The conjunaion of Saturn and Mercury fhe\\'S craft, fubtilty, and po- -
licy, that the native will dive into many fecret, deep, and occult, things,
find out myH:eries, be covetous and proud, n1ixed with a certain kind of
gravity~ If Saturn be fignificator, the native l)as a good elocution; but,
if Mercury, he has a great impediment in his fpeech.
•
-
'rhe conjunEtion of Saturn and Luna fhe·ws one poor and obfcure; if
Saturn be fignificator,. the ,man is changeable, feldom . an hour in one
mind, often doing.things, and· then repenting of them again; but, if
Luna be fignificatrix, he is grave, cautious, mafapert, over-wife an·d con...
ceited,. and for the mofi part wilful in all things.
The conjunaion ·or Jup~ter and Mars, if Jupiter be fignificator, makes
the native choleric, hafty, angry, bold, proud, prefutnptuous, and dar-
ing; gives hip1 fo1ne 111artial comman9, and glory and reno\Vn in ·warlike
undertakino-s; but, ]f Mars be fignificator, it makes hi.m milder, reli-
gious, good, jufi, gives him preferment in the law, or he becomes a prieH,
deacon_
, bifhop, or other dignitary in the church.
I . •
The conjnnB.ion of Jupiter and Sol: if Jupiter be fignificator, he af-
fliEls the native feverely, cans him into a deep melanc~holy or defp~ir,
feizes him with a fever or frenzy, brings the body to a confumption, and
affiiB:s the eflate with confiderable lols, even to .his utter, ruin and de!lruc-
tion; yet, when by direaion Jupiter frees himfelf from Sol's beams, thefe ~
evils will ceafe; but, if Sol be fignilicator, he fo debilitates Jupiter, that
the configuration can promife nothing, but it makes the native reli-
. .
gtous.
Th·e conjunction of Jupiter and Venus: if Jupiter be fignificator, the
native is fuperlatively happy (more efpecially ifthe configurations happen
in Pifees, the houfe of Jupiter, and exaltation of Venus); he increafes in

quillity of Illtnd, havincT in general the love of \\·onlan-ktnd ; but, if
\'enus be fignificatrix, the nauvc has beauty, healLh, and riches, attains
to great honour and rcnovvn, is truly virtuous, pious, and religious, and
has generally cc"clefiaHical or j urifprudential prcfcnnent. 'fhts is one or
the n1ofi happy configurations that can be. .
The conjunaion of Jupiter and Mercury, if Jupiter be fignificator,
1nakcs the native virtuous, religious, 'vife, of great knO\\·ledge, and of
good elocution, n1akcs a general {cholar, and gives him the knov;Jcdgc
of tnoU ~rts a~d fci~nces; he tnay pro.ve to be the atn~nH~dor ?fa pr!nce,
or fuch-hke; but, 1f Iv1ercury be fign1ficator, the nauvc ts fohd, fertous,
and grave, pious and religious, and probably rnay acquire a good efiatc
by rnerchandife or fame ccclefiafl:ical pro1notion.
,· rfhe conjunaion of Jupiter and.. Luna: if Jupiter be fignificator, the
nati\'e proves a traveller, it may be beyond fea; he is generally of a.
changeable and mutable tnind, and, although naturally of a very good
humour and condition, yet fometimes pettifh, fro\vard, and peevifi1.' If
Luna be fignificatrix, it gives great riches and trea{ures, according to the
nati,,e's capacity or birth, makes him prudent, 'vife, religious, and ho-
nourable; gives him the acquaintance of great and ,-.,·orthy men, clcrgy-
tnen, and {uch-Jike, and probably church preferment. ·
The conjunElion of Mars and Sol fhews a hot and dry conflitution,
danger of fhort life, and death by hettie fevers, marafmos, or by fire or
lightning. If Mars be fignificator, the native has the favour of ktngs and
princes, and it may be their fro,vns too, to his utter undoing ; he tnay
rife haUily, but perhaps to a precipice. If Sol be fignificator, the native
proves valiant and v(arlike, attains fome martial comn1and or prefern1en~;
but if he goes into w·ar he is killed in the battle, or at be1t ~ome·s off
\\rounded, or \Vith the 1ofs of a lin1b. .
The conjunElion of rvfars and Venus : if Mars be fignificator, the na·
tive is given up to \vomen, and retains the acquaintance of fuch as have
an infamous life and converfation ; he is kind, gentle, and courteous,
and, though fon1etin1es hafiy, yet of a good humour and difpofition, in-
iomuch that his kindnefs is oftentin1es his undoing; but, if Venus b\!
fignificatrix, the native is ]uflful, lafcivious, a fornicator, adult<!rer;
gtven over to "'icked and lewd courfcs, haHy, rafh, proud, inconfiderate,
quarrelfomc, and running himfelf into 1nany hazards, dangers~ troubles,
and loffes.

lighting in \Vomen's company, by ,vhom he meets either with fortune or

mifchief falls in the fore part of life,.and the native, through his- own
folly, lofes a great part of his fortune or cfiate. If Jupiter is fisnifica..

valour is but a vapour. If the Sun be fignificator, it is the afpeCl of

11cffc~, a \\'andercr, a vagabond, a dctraaor from other rpcn's w·orth, one
fiupid, anrl of a fcrvilc life, unfortunate in all h1s undertakings. If the
Moon be fignificatrix, the native will be in danger of lofing one of his
eyes, die a violent death, or be fubjca to many croffes, troubles, and
amiaions of fortune and jufiicc; he is fubjea to hurts, 'vounds, and
other 1nifchief~; and is mutable, ra{h, paffionate, ambitious, prodigal,
tnalicious, treacherous, and fubjeB: to innumerable miferics.
The quartile or oprofition of Sol and Venus ; if Sol be fignificator,
the native Jives in a d1fhonourable repute, receives many great troubles
and tnisfortunes by means of women; he is bold, confident, proud, one
delighting in firife,_ contention, and oppofition, unfortunate in moil of
his aflions, anrl cotning off in mofi of his undertakings with difhonour.
If Venus be fignificatrix, the. native deludes himfelf vrith vanities, and
expeCtations of things 'vhich will never be; he is angry, paHionate,
and given up to pride, boafl:ing, and vain glory ; receives much hurt by
great 1nen, and fometimes may be in danger of his life by fentencc of
the judge. , ...
The quartile or oppofiii~n of Sol and Mercury; if Sol be fignificator,
t1Je native is fubjea to many loifes and vexations by the law; or receives
hurt by mercurial men and things ; is unfortunate, and has an impedi-
ment in his fpeech; one that is deceitful, falfe, and not to be trufied. If
Mercury be fignificator, the native is of a middJe fiature, dull f\varthy
complexion, tanned or fun-burnt, 'vith light-brown hair, full face ana
eye, high nofe, hafiy, choleric, proud, angry, and infolent; a boafier,
ambitious, highly conceited of himfelf, and fubjeEt to the frowns of
princes and great men.
The quartile or oppofition of Sol and Luna; if Sol be fignificator,-the
native's fortune is mutable and unfiable, he falls into contempt and re·
proach among the common people, and merits the hatred or difpJeafure
of fome great lady or· perfon; he is a cheat, deceiver, or impofior. If
Luna be fignificatrix, the native is full-faced, of a ~lear vifage, and light-
coloured hair, very ambitious of hono\lr, '\·hich flies from· him like a
fhadow purfued; one aiming at and attempting n1any areat things 'vith-
out fuccefs,' but meet1ng 'vith many cro.ffes, loifes, trou~lesi forro\~S, and
obfiruaions, in ~his way to preferm~nt.
The quartile or oppofition of "\Tenns and Mercury ; if Venus be figni-

~villed, crofs, and indeed a perf~a knave, one whofe ill conditibns and

tive ·is J deceitful, difhonefi, flothful, given to indolence and ea{e, and
deljghts in the comp.any of lewd "\\to.men ; a mere diffembler, and one
t.hat wafies and fpends his fortune in debauchery. · , ' 'l ·1 ...

The quartile or oppofition of Venus and Luna; if Venus b~ figrufica-
trix, it Ihews mutability, firife, contention, quarrelling, debate, one of
iln .ill tongue and a \vorfe life, unfortunate,in marriage and children, one
idle, indolent, and lazy, fubje& to poverty and beggary. (If Luna be fig-
~lificatrix, the perfon is ofa bold, irnpudent, audacious, !difpofition, given
.up to lull ~nd le\vdnefs; a mere vulgar fordjd crea'ture, a wanderer,
fugitive, and vagabond; deceitful, 'and fubjea to an1ultitude of misfor.. ..
tup.es., efpecially from and among women. #
The ·quartile or oppofition of Mercury and ·Luna; if Mercury be fig-
nificator, the native is mutable; unftable in all i. his ways, foolifh, arro-
gant, void of reafon and good TJ:)anners, loquacious, and very much con-
ceited of h1mfelf; he fhall meet vvith many trpubles and oppofitiops,
and that fron1 the common people, lofe .the favour of feme noble \VO-
tnah, and ,be-·.red.uced to an abject fiate of poverty : 'the frowns of a
prince are not fo formidable as the hatred of the common people, for that
fo precipit3:tes a man, that it prevents him for ever from rifing again
without feme extraordinary aid : if Luna be fignificatrix, let . the native
take what care and pains l1e will, he fhall never do any thing commenda-
ble.;·it fignifies a defea in the tongue, and I makes the native in every
undertaking very unfortunate, and for the 1110fi par~t ex pofed to contempt
and irifan1y.

tran{its the conjunaion of the lord of the fecond or part of fortune; but
the tranfits of a good planet to their conjunCtion are advantageous.

The judgments of a reyolution are eafy to be determined, by confider-
ing in 'vhat hou{e and fign in the revolution the radical fignificators are
pofited ; for according to thofe revolutional pofitions and configurations
'""e are to judge. So that, if the lord of the fecond houfe be in the third, it
fhews gain to come either by travel, or by kindred, or neighbours ; and, if
he be alfo in fextile or trine with the lord of the third in the radix, the
farne ; if \Vith the lord of the fourth, by a father; if in the medium creli,
or in conjuntlion, fextile, or trine, with his radical lord, gain by trade,
office, preferment, or noblemen. Hence it appears, that the Iignificator of
fubfiance in a revolution is not the lord of the fecond in the revolution,
but the lord of the fecond in the radix ; the fignificator of lands is not
the lord of the fourth in the revolution, but the 1ord of the fourth in the
r·adix; the fame is to be underflood of the refi; but, if the fame fig~ "\\·hich
afcended radically afcends in the revolution, its effeas \\yill be the more
firm, becaufe the fignificators are the fame; the like, if the fatne planets

in the revolution, though they poilefs not the farne fign.

reaions, giving the native nlelancholy difeafes, efpecially in thofe parts
fignified by the fign·in which the fiar is ; he goes alfo under fcandal and
reproach. To Hircus, is a very noble direaion, and may !ignify the ad-
.vancement of the native in all things, chiefly in military affairs; yet in-
vel ves him in feveral vices and troubles with women ; and bids ·him be-
w.are of fome fevere wound.... by a fall, blo\v, or fiab. The fignificatio~s
of the part of fortune, being direCted in like manner,. are altogether the
fame with what we hinted in the direaions of the fecond houfe.
•
· In all thefe direEtions we mufi have great regard both to the fign an~ the ,
houfe. In direaions which concern the body, we have refpea-to the fign,
becaufe that moil: commonly indicates the part affiiaed ; fo alfo does the
houfe; for,_ if the direaion falls in the afcendant, the affiietion falls in the ,
head, as on the eyes, nofe, ears, or brain ; if in the fecond, in the throat,
&c. · In direaioris, which concern the efiate, honour, or fortune, we
chiefly take notice of the houfe, fo·r that indicates the means by which the
thing fhaU be attained; the nature of the fiar, the quality of the perfon;
ifin the third, by a kinfman, or by travel; if in the fevent!t, by a wife,
or 'voman. · , ·
In direaing any planet' to thefe fixed flars, confider whether the fiar
fympathizes •nith the fignificator in nature and quality, or not; ifit does,
the direEljon may be go.od, although 1t be to an evil fiar; for [,veet to fweet
is [,veet; like to like breeds no difcord; and union and agreement of natures
takes away the evil effetts; for, if the lord of the afcendant was Saturn,
and he fhould be direaed to Cauda Leonis, a fiar of his o\vn nature, this
could be no evil direElion, nor any way affiiB: the native either in body
or efi:ate; but would have famous and glorious effects, both for health and
\Vealth, according to the place it falls in. In thefe direaions, we are
pr~ncipal1y to regard the magnitude of the fi.ar; for fiars only of the fi.r!l:
magnitude prefage things eminently glorious or dangeroufly defiruB:ive ;
and thofe ,vhich are of the fecond come very ne~r the~. "Then the place
of the direEtion is to be noted; for, if it falls in an angle, the direaion
will not only be famous and eminent, but alfo manifefl: itfelf with a great
deal of life and vigour, and that on a·fudden; in a fuccedent houfe_, th~
effeas will be more languid; in a cadent_, not only weak and flow, bu~ it
may be a quefl:ion whether they will ever. operate at a.ll. Regard ,mufl:
alfo be had to the latitude ; for fiars havtng fouth latitude operate not
fo much upon our northern hemifphere as thofe 'vhich have north;
thofe which have no latitude fbew their effea, be they good or evil,
\Vith
0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.
,vith firict equ3lity ; and thofc \vhich ~ave north latitude manfell their
force \Vith great vigour.
'fhe fign alfo in which the fiar js politcd is m uch to be confidered; for
fixed fiars in cardinal figns exceed the others jn po'A·er by fo much as
their place is more excellent and remarkable. And if a direCt:ion to any
eminent fixed fiar falls in fextile or trine to the places of any of the for-
tunes or of the luminaries, or coheres with any other eminent direCtion
at or near the fume time to the body or afpcct of any planet o f the nature
of the fame fiar, the effects will not only be indubitably evident, but
alfo very ftriking and wonderful.
The durability of their effeCt remains only to be confidered; wherein
mufi. be noticed, whether there be a continued feries of direClions attend-
ing of the fatne purport and effect; for, if there be, and nothi'ng contra-
diCl:s their influence, the effeEts of them will, \Ve n1ay fafcly conclude,
be durable and lafting.

APHORISMS for guiding the JUDGMENT upon NATIVITIES and
HORARY QYESTIONS.
I I
Confider the degree ~fcending, Sol and Luna; and fee whether they are
afflicted, or not; if they are extremely afHiCl.ed, or either of them, it is an
argument of lhort life, and therefore it "pill be in vain to forrn long di-
rections for fuch a nativity. Thefe points are faid to be afflicted or un-
fortunate, ,vhen either the conj untlioo, quartile, or oppofition, of the
infortunes vitiate their places, or when many violent fixed fi.1rs of th'.!
nature of the lord of the eighth afcend with the degree afccnding or \Vith
the luminaries.
Confider the Jord of the afcendant alfo; for, if he be elfentially firong,
free from the affiittion of the infortunes, not cotnbu1t nor retrograde, nor
impeded by the lord of the fourth, fixth, eighth, or twelfth, houfes, but
encreafing in nun1ber, light, and motion, it flle\VS long life. If the S un
in a birth by day, or the Moon in a birth by night, be f1rong, free from
affiia ion, and afiified by the fortunes, it thews long life; but thofe \vho
are born exaCtly upon the very change or full of the Moon feldotn live
long; the Moon befieged bet\Veen Saturn and Mars argues ihort life:.
That planet \vhich has tuotl: dignities elfential a·od accidental in a

of M:Jr~, a confident opinion; of Sol, a proud heart; of Vtnus, a pleafant
wit; and of Luna, a ready and piercing wit.
If many planets be fifong· and e1fentially fortified, efpeci:llly Satur'n,
Jupitt:r, and Mars, or Sol, the native will enjoy a fnanifeft and an)ple for-
tune, live nobly, and in great efreem, above the ordinary quality of his
birth, rnanaging the attions of his whole life with glory and fu~cefs; and
this judgment \vill be n1ore confirmed, if moft or all the planets be tfi~n..
tially fortified at the fan1e tin1e. But, contrariwife, \vhen moft of the
planets are in their de~ritnen t. or fall, pcregri ne, cadent, retrograde::, afflict-
ed, or co1nbuft; the native is then continually involved in a thoufand mif-
fortunes, one upon the heels of another, and his whole life is nothing
but a vale of n1ifery. But a 1nediocrity of tefiianonies !hews a various for-
tune, fometimes rniferab1e; fometimes extremely happy, according to the
times of evil or good direB.ions. ·

frorn the affiiClion of S:1turn or Mars, arc ample te!l:imonies of a large

of the p~rt of fortunt: in the eighth, or the lord of the eighth cffentially
fortified in a good houfe, proo1ifcs the native an ell:ate by th~ death of
friends. '] he Moon con1 hufi, or in conjuntlion, quartile, or oppofition,
of Saturn, defiroys nn efiate though never fo large, reduces the native
to poverty ; the fame happens if the lord of the fecond be fo.
If the fignificator of fubllanc~ be effentialJy fortified, \VelJ polited, free
from affii~wlion, or in a fixed fign, the native's fubfiance will be firm and
durable all his life. An infortune in the fecond, firong, !hews, tb.tt the
ell:ate may continue, but \vith great difficulty; but, if \Ve~k, that it \vil l
cotne to nothing; if a fortune be there, the native's ell:ate \vill be firm.
If no planet bt: in the fc:cond, confider the lord of the fecond, pnd the dif-
pofitor of the part of fortune, and judge by thenl, and by their directions
to good or t vil promiffors. The fignificators of fubO:ancc orientJl and

lo{cs by travel, and \vill al\vays be in danger of thieves or robbers upon

religion, ecclefia!licnl preferment, honour, or Jaw; the like of the other
planets. If the lignificator be in the nfcend tnt, the native is poffe!fed with
a natural defire of feeing firangc countries ; in the fecond, he travels for
a defign of enriching hirnft:lf; and fo of the other houfes.
If the lord of the ninth be in the afccndant, the native \Vill travel much;
if in the fecond houfe, he will gain confiderably by his travels; if in the
third, he will cohabit with firange women, and often lhift his refidence;
if in the fourth, his parents \Vill have fome occult infirn1ities, and he will
die on his travels; if in the fifth, he \vill have have children in another
country; if in the fixth, he \vill gain by his flaves or fervants, and hig cat..
t(e \Vill fall fick in his travels; if in the feventh, he will obtain a good
and obedient \vife. When the fignificators of journeys arc elfentia11y
ftrong, well pofitcd, and free from affiidion, and in fextile or trine of a
good planet, they denote honour, profperity, and fecurity, in travels, quod
capax, according to the quality of the perfon; and contrarhvife, if S:t-
turn or Mars afflict the fignificators, it 1he\vs, in the twelfth houfe,
donger of imprifonment; i'n the fecond or third, treachery by kindred or
neighbours, or danger by con1n1on thieves; but, in this judgment, Sa.turn
1hews rather poverty and want of money; Mars, bodily \Vounds. r-fhe
coun tries into which the native had bell travel, are chiefly thofe fubjea to
the figns of the afcendant, fecond, ninth, tenth, and eleventh,; or thofo
1igns an whi<.:h Jupiter, Venus, Part of Fortune, or Dragon's Head, are
pofited ; but thofe fubjea to the figns in \Vhich the infortunes or Dragon's
Tail are poficed, \Nill prove unfavourable to the travcl1er; and fo alfo will
thofe that ?re futjetl. to the figns of the fourth, fixth, feventh, eighth,
or twelfrh, houf\;s.
Saturn, Mars, or the Dragon's Head, in the ninth, or Saturn or 1vlars
in the third, oppofite to the ninth, Jupiter being peregrine, cadent, and af-
tiiCl:ed, !hews either pernicious fectaries, of no religion, or atheifts•.. But
Jupiter, Venus, or the Pragon's Head, in the ninth, ilie\VS a truly reli-
gious perfon; the fame if Sol, l'vlercury, I.~u na, or Part of Fortune, be
there in fextile or trine \Vith Jupiter or Venus. If no planets are in the
ninth, confider its lord and Jupiter; if they or either of them be eflen-
tially fortified and firong, or angular, or in reception \Vith Sol or Luna,
or with the lord of the afcendant or planets th.erein, or pofited in· the af-

AN ILLUSTRATION
Mercury lord of the geniture, or firong in the afcendant) gives the n1-
tive an ndrnirable fancy an.d great eloc~tion ; if he be in goo~ afpeCt \Vi th
Luna or Venus, or in reception with either of thenl, he proves a.famous
orator; if in good afpeCl: or reception with Saturn or Jupirer, .he makes
an excellent.philofopher or divine; if with Mars, a good phyfician, fur-
geon, or mathematic~an. ·Mercury in cafimi, and in his own dignities~
n1akcs the native a great orator, or fubt le coun.fcllor in the efrin1ation of
'atl men. .Mercury in fquarc or oppofition of f\llars gives a fharp, but
a turbulent and troublcfon1e, wit and unrler!l:anding; one never conteotp
but al\vays fecking out ne\V things and firange inventions. Mercury in
an angle in Pifces, afflicted of Mars or Sot, and the .l\1oon in an angle,
affiiEled of Saturn, makes a fool or a snadman; for thefe configurations op-
prefs the brain, and reprefent a tboufand fancies. Mercury in Cancer, re-
trogr~de, in fquare to Mars anq Jupiter, and they in oppofition to each
other in the nativity of a divine,·n1ake a great enthufiJfi. · If Mercury be
afHiCl:ed by Saturn, in thofe genitures where Cancer, Scorpio, or Pifces,
afcend, the native is either dutnb or has a very great impediment in
his fpeech; the fatne if Mercury be with the Dragon~s Tail; if affiiRed by
Mars in fuch a genefis, the na~ive fiamrners very much.. Mercury free
from affiietion in geniture~ where Gemini, Virgo, Libra, Sagittarius,
or Aquaries, afcend, gives the native a graceful fpeech and an excellent ~
elocution• . Mercury and the Dragon's Tail in the afcendant in Libra, an'd
the Moon in Aries in the feventh, .lnake the native a promoter of fcandal
and falfehood. Mercury in either of the h~ufes of Saturn gives a. found -~
underfianding; and, if he be in fextile, trine, or reception, of Saturn, the
native coines into great 'repute by his ingenuity. Mercury in the houfes
of Mars, in g_ood afpeEl of Luna and lord of the afcendant, -gives an ex-
cellent underftanding.
• .
Luna being lady of the geniture or ftrong in the afcendant, the native
loves novelties, is fubjett to mutation, and defirous of travelling to fee,dif..
tant countries; of a gentle nature and difpofition, and timorous; if lhe be
in afped: with Mercury, the native will be n1afier of many languages. Lu-
na in conjunaion with the Pleiades, and· in quartile of Mars from an
angle, ll1ews great defeCts in the eyes,- if not total blindnefs. l ...upa in
conjunCtion or oppofition of Sol in any genefis, iliews that the native
\~1.illlive but a lhort tirne unlefs the Moon has great latitude; for that
fon1etirnes n1ay make the conjunB:ion or oppofition eight or nine degrees
difiant. I..una in conjunet:ion of Saturn in an earthy fign, and an earthy
fign af~ending, makes the native very melancholy and low-fpirited. Luna
in reception and trine of -Me.rcury gives a good underfian~ing, and makes
the native abIe to overrurn t'he argun1ent s of moft n1en. L uoa in the

honour, if not cJptivity, or death in prifon. Luna in Via Con1bufi:a, and
Sol in Via Lacb:a, denote gre:lt danger to the eyes; if the infortuoes be in
the afcendant, or in oppofition thereto, it prcfilges blindnefs. Luna, Sol,
or the afcendant, direCted to the conjuntlion of Mars, thew the fma11-
pox or n1ealles in children; in o1en it denotes malignant fevers ; and, in
elderly people, death. Luna in good afpect of the altnuten of the medium
creli, and in the fame with the lord of the afcendant, gives the the native
eminent honour. Luna or Sol, or both, or the afcendant, affiiCled by
the body or partiJe afpeCl: of the infortunes, denotes that they \Vill be of
a vr;ry lhort and fickly life.
'
Fixed fiars of the firll or fecond magnitude in the afcendant, or rnedium
cre1i, give the native: extraordinary fame nnd honour, mak~ him eminent
and profperous, 3nd one whom the world will adtnire. Fixed fi:ars of a
violent nature, upon the cufp of the n1edium creli, and its lord pofited
\-vith fuch, lhe\~ defiruEt.ion to the native's honour and fame. Fixed ftars
are to be confidered, in general pofitions or directions, in refpeCl: of their
afpeCl:s, as well as the planets.
The mediun1 cceli afflicted by the Dragon's Tail, and both the lumina-
naries affiitted by Mars, in a violent fign in the fourth, lhew a v.·retched
end, l>oth to the honour and life of the native:. 'fhe medium creli well
fortified gives the native not only great honour, but fuch as !hall be fixed ,.
and durable; though fometimes upon bad direaions it tnay be fubject
to jnterruptiuns. 'i he n1ediu1n creli diretled to promittors never kills,
unlc!s· in the genefis there be :figns of .a..vjolent death.
All the planets, or moll: of them, above the earth, make the native,
of \\' hatfoever CJ.pacity, eminent and fan1otis beyond it; and, jf they ihaJI
be fa pofited in their dignities, he Jhall, like a comet, out-!hine all others
jn the place \vhere ·he liv<!s. All the planets in a nativity retrograde, and
under the earth, though the native be of great and noble birth, lhew hirn
not of a rifiog, but of a falling, fame and fortune. The lord of the af-
cendant fironger than the lord of the feventh fi1e\VS the native always OYer-
COOlCS his adverfaries, and fo contrariwife. ~Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius,
afcending, and the lord of the afcendant in the n1edium creli, lhe\\'S
'the native will al\vays be aiming at things beyond the capacity of his
birth or prefen t fortune. _ .' . ·
The inferior planets many ~imes fhew _
great honour to the fame of a
native, but will not be of long continuance. The fortunes in the ninth
nHtke fan1ous churchmen, la\vyers, und rich merchants; the fame, if the
benevolents trine the ninth or lord thereof. Many planets in the ninth,

in the nativities of any clafs of perfons, gives thetn the highefi honour and
dignity in the::ir profeflion. If Virgo afcend, the nati ve is generally very
ing~n ious, unlefs Mereu r)' be in Sagittarius or Pifees; and then the native
is generally confident and conceited of his own abilities, though a n1~ re
fool. 'The lord of the n1edium creli in the twelfth, and the lord of the
t\velfth in the afcendant, denote captivity or in1prifonrnent; the like if
~be Moon or lord of tbe afcendant be pofi ted in the twel hh. The greater
the planets dignities are, the fnore fplendid and glorious are the native's
nonour and fortune; the greater their debilities, the more obfcnre will
be his. If the medillm creli be directed to the~ body_of Saturn, he being
pofited in the tenth or eleventh hou(e, the native will lofe all his honour
and offices, and \vill fcarcely ever rife again to preferment; and, if in fuch
genefis there be fignifications of a violent death, the aforefaid dire..:i.ion
puts an inglorious period to the nat"ive's life.
A continued feries of good direCtions makes a bad nativity fometimes
very gpod; but that good ]afis not long. Two, three, or more, planets -
in the eighth, upon good direaions unto tben1, encreafe greatly the na-
tive's fubfiance by wills and legacies of the dead. The eleventh houfe,
fortified by the prefence of good planets, lhews -n1any great and powerful
friends, but, by the prefence of evil p.lanets', and they ill-affected, it
lhews few and faitblefs friends. The lord of the eleventh fironger than
the lord of the feventh declares the native,s friends to be more powerful
than his enemies.
All the planets under the earth, when they promife honour, dignity,
and fortune, which is chiefly \Vhen they' are efientiJlly fortified in noc-
turnal genitures, generally perform it in the latter part of native'& hfe.
All the plan~ts in a nativity out of their effential dignities, thew obfcure
perfons; who, if they ever attain any honour, glory, or renown, in the
world, never long enjoy it. A fortunate planet in the eighth houfe always
denotes a natural death; the lord of the eighth in the rned1um creli lhews
the native will die by the fentence of a judge. Such ai bave a fatelliurn,
oa· croud of planets in angles, have at (o,ne time or other of their Iives
prodigious {uccefs or detritnent, according to the occurring direClions.
Many planets in reception, or in good afpeet of each other, give the native
many and good friends. Planets fquaring or oppoficg each other from
angles and cardinal figns denote grea·t misfortunes to the native, and that
at laft he !hall die a violent death. CaTdinal figns poifeffing the angles of
a nativity mJke the native, if of any capacity, tnofr eminent and famous in

force of the tranfits. So,ne perfons~ although they have bad genitures,
rife wonderfully, becaufe their gcnitures fympathize with the nativities
o( thofe by \Vbon1 they are raifed. The greateft fyn1pathy that can be in
any t\VO nativities, is by having the fortunes in one upon the places of

RUDIMENTS of the DOCTRINE of HORARY QYES~rlONS.
Let the radix be drawn into a fpeculum, and, being fully and com-
pletely directed \vith obfervations of all the current tranfits, draw forth
the revolution alfo of the year. Then, confider the tnatter about •.vhich
the queftion is propofed, \vhether it be tranlfient or durahle. Confid~r
alfo. to what houie the thing belo.ngs, what planet is the fignificator
thereof, the afcendant and its lord; and the planets \Vhich 1nay confirr11,
in1pede,. or defl:r~y, the bufinefs. vVhat planets are hurtful to che fignifi-
cator of the thing,. and confequen~ly to the quercnr, which are fuch as

the good afpea of the lord ·of the afcendant ; the matter !hall corne to
p~fs, or take effeet. So if a planet by direction or tranfit hath lately
fcparated fron1 the fignificators of the thing, and immediately applies
to the conjunCtion, fextile, or trine, of the }ord of the afcendan t or pla-
' net therein, it fl1ews the £1me. If the fignificators of ~he thing, or lord of
the fourth fron1 the houfe lignifying the fame, !hall tranfit the afcendant,
or come by direB.ion thereto, it ihews good. If the radical and revolu-
tional fignificators apply by good afpea in the Ephemeris, or are in
reception, or another . planet ·makes a tranfl.ation or ·collection of their
-light, it iliews the perfeCtion of the matter. If the afore~'\id tranfits or
diretlions happen to be in mutual reception to the lords of their radical
places, it ll1e\VS fo much the more eminent good. ,And, v'hether the fig-
nificators be ftrong or weak at the time of the_direElion or tranfi t, if
they were firong in the radix, their fignifications will be the more firm.
If any planet colleds the light of both fignificators, and at that tin1e tran-
fits the afcendant or houfe fignifying the thing, it perfeB:s the tnatter.
,.rhe fan1e if by direRion or tranfit they come to one another's places in
the radix, or to any eminent fixed ftar, upon the cufp of the eleventh
houfe or medium c~li. Confider \vhat houfe the planet \vhich tranf.. -
lates or colleCts the light of the .fignificators is lord of and pofited in,
for according to the nafure of the things fignified by thofe houfes l11all
the rnatter terminate. If the Sun, Moon, or Part of Fortune, tranfit the
medium .creli, or hou{e fignifyi ng the thing, or come thereto by direc-
tion, it lignifies good. But, if there be neither direCtion nor tranfit,
nor fignificators of good or evil, it .is requifite to fufpend judgment to a
future day. ·
•
If 'it be aweighty and durable thing which is defired, it will fcarcely
be performed without. a good direCtion or tranfit; yet you may judge
thereof,· according to the next that comes, as it is either good or eviL.
But, if the oppofite evil to what we have ftated !houl'd happen, then judge
of it by the contrary rule,; but, if both good and evil happen, judge ac-
cording to the more weighty and greater number of tt?ftimonies. And
w.hatfoever we have faid of the radix, if the fame configurations happen
in the revolution, they imp?rt the fatne, but not \vith fuch powerful effect.
Lafily confider to what points in the revolution the radical fignifi-
cators approach by tranfit or diretlion; or contrariwife, to what points
in·the radix the revolutional' 11gnificators apply; and accordingly, as it
is ~ither good or evil, join aJl with the other· configurations aforefaid,
aJtd accordingly judge.

RUDIMENTS of the DOC'f'RINE .of RADICAL ELECTIONS.
If any thing be rea1Jy intended to be obtained, the time of the be-
ginning and undertakin~ thereof ought to be eJeCled frorn the radix
of life, and nothing c) fe. For at that time, once for. all, the great God
deputed every fignificator to a certain purpofe or fignificacion, and firmly
efiablilhed the fan1e for ever unalterable by the power of nature. ~rherc:­
fore, in making an eletlion, firfl: correctly learn what planet is the: true
and real fignificator of the thing defired, for without the true kno\vJedge
thereof all is h1 vain; fecof1dly, confider the nature and quality of the
thing, \vhether it be proportional to the capacity of hi1n who defires it,
or itnpoflible.
.
Confider alfo to \vhat houfe of heaven the fame doth appertain, and
\vhat en1inent fixed fiars were upon or near the cufp thereof, and what ·
planets in the radix beheld it by friendly afpeCl:. Note, likewife the re-
volution, \Vhat fign is upon the cufp of the fan~e · boufe, what planet is
lord thereof, or beholds it by good afpect. Confider the promitfor, or
planet, or houf~ fignifying that or thern, by or from whoan the thing
hoped for is to be obtained or performed. Then confider in every elec-
tion the fourth houfe, from the houfe fignifying the thing, its lord, and
planet pofited (if any be) therein; for that hath fignification of the end
of the matter.
Let the radix be dircded with a fpeculun1 completely fitted, thereby
readily to obferve, with a glance of the eye, all the tranfits of every
fignificator, whether good or evil. 1·his done, obfervc at \vhat time the
.fignificators come by direttion or tranfit to the body ·or good afpeet of the
pro1niffor in the radix, or to the lord of the fourth, or planet pofited
therein, or eminent fixed il:ar of the nature of the promiffor, or at \".rhat
tin1e there is nny tranflation n1ade by the pron1ilfor, Sun, or Moon, by

therein; as alfo at \vhat time in -the Epben1eris they conlt: to any good
afpett, and n1ake your election for the fan1e accordingly.
Obferve \Vhen thofe ranical fignificntors come by direCtion or tran fi t

Let the £gnificators, ·but efpecially the promiffors, be efi~ntially forti-

and 1ord of the eleventh, be free from all affiiEiion, ' and hafiening by di-
re~ion or tranfit to {orne good <;onfigur-ation, A"nd let th~ fame fign and
degree if poffible afcend, at the undertaking, \vhich did in the radix, for
then the fignificators arc tbe fc·uue; if that cannot be, let thofe upon the
cpfp of the houfe flgnifying the thing, afcend; or let the Sun or Moon
be pofited in the houfe lignifying the thing, taking heed that the radical
infortunes Jnay be cadent if poffible, ~nd not angular. Obferve if there
be any reception between the radical fignificators a·nd pron1iffors ; the
fame obferve in the revolution; or \Vhcther the radical and revolutional
fignificators are il) reception one \Yith another at the tin1e of the directions
or tranfi ts, for that -is very pr.omifing; and thofe afpects only are propi- '
tious to make elections in.
LafUy, if.,the radical fignificators be weak or unfortunate, thet·e can
be no firong Or firm e)eetion made for the natiVe; for \Yhat good 'can be
expected to proceed from we.ik, afflicted, impotent, and unfortunate,
promiffors or bel ps ? It is true there tnay be an accidental good, but that
never can overcome the power of. an eff~otial or radical evil; yet, if an
elect.~on be made for fuch a one, let the fignificators be efl~n tiaJly .fl:rong
at the tin1e of the eleClion, and if poffible in trine to ~heir radic::d places.

Now~ if the exact time be required in which any thing fignified lhould
come to pafs, that mufi be found by the diretlion of each fignifi·cator to
their refpettive promiffors, both by progt:effive and c~nverfe operation ; or
by dra\ving a fpeculum for the mun.dane afpeCts, which will at firft fight
point out the year, month, and day, in which all the material accidents of

In regulating :1nd nfcertaioing thefe judgments, the di(crect All:rolo-
gian n1uft likc\vi(e undcrll:and, that all fiery figns incline snen to be cho-
leric, hafty, furious, quarrelfotne, revengeful, proud, an1l>itiO\)S, in1pe-
rious, in1portunatc, hardy, :tnd raviCb; involving thcmfelvt:s in mnny trou-
bles and n1isfortuncs; yet they arc n1ofily ingenious, but often changing
~ their opinions and purfuits.
Airy figns !hew men cheerful, affable, courteous, liberal, free-hearted,
faithful, good-natured, and loving mirth, fuch as finging, dancing, mu-
fic, and all civil recreations ; of modefl: deportnlent nnd n1anners, and of
found reafon and underltanding.
E;trthy figns denote perfons of referved .thought, flo,~ in fpeech, and
deliberate in all their undertakings, keeping clofe their counfel and
intention. They alfo frequently prove to be very fraudulent, covetous,
nnd fufpicious, feldom forgetting or _
forgiving injuries ; of[en forro\vful
and low-fp~rited; loving no man's efieem but their own; for the n1ofi
part prudent and careful, but aufiere and fur1y in their manners and
deportment.
.
Watery figns make then1 co"'ardly, luxurious~ wanton, mutable, dulJ,
and fluggilh; with low, effeminate, whining, voice~. very timorous and
fearful, having much deceit in them. They are ufually pretty much
given t..o the fchools and nurferies of Venus, \Vhich often prove a great
injury to them, and fometimes their total ruin.
It mull: alfo be remembered, th.at Saturn is extremely cold and dry,
Jupiter is remifsly hot and moift, Mars extremely hot and dry, the Sun
is meanly hot and dry, Venus is hot and moift, Mercury is ren1ifsly cold
and dry, the Moon is meanly cold and moifi:. If Saturn be in Aries, his
drinefs is increafed, and his coldnefs abated, or he is inteofely dry, or re..
n1ifsly cold : in Taurus he aB:s with a double force, viz. he is intenfely
cold and dry; in Gemini he is remifsly cold and dry; in Cancer he is in..
tenfely cold; fo that~ if Saturn afpeet the afcendant from nny of thefe
figns, he varies his influence, according to the fign he is in. A planet in
his houfe, as the Sun in Leo, retains his own nature, and is well affcclc:d
in his influence ; but if in his detriment, as in Aquaries, he is then iJI
affeeted or deprived. If he be only peregrine, he is meanly affea ed as ro
good or evil, viz. neitHer effentially ll:rong nor \Veak; if in his fall, he
flags in his motion, and is a man indifpofed and uneafy. Therefore a
planet in his fall or detriment effeEls no good to the native; if any, it is
depraved, and confequently dangerous or pernicious•

A planet direCt and fwift in n1otion, or on the contrary, is as thofe very

chief virtue or moft powerful parts as to the fignification of that houfe·;
if Saturn and the Sun be in conjunction in Leo in the tenth houfe, the
latter being neareft to the cufp thereof, then'the native arrives to fon1e
degree of dignity or honour from the analogy, pofition, dominion, or
fortitude, of the Sun, as alfo his propinquity to the cufp. But Saturn
being of a contrary nature, and adverfe to w.hat the Sun portends, alfo
l1ating the place of his refidence, and partly affiiB:ing the Sun, will there_.
fore caufe Come unhappy misfortune to arife, and cloud the glory pro..
tnifed ·by the Sun in the end. Sat.urn i.n conjunCtion with Jupiter in
Virgo is o1oft powerful, and overcomes in his effects; but, if they are
, conjoined i~ Aries, .then Jupiter is firongefr, and becomes victor. Thi9
reciprocally by each being in his fall. " J
r tfbe luminaries are to be confidered as tnore powerful and fignificant
than the refi ·of the planets; and therefore any of the fuperiors in conj unc.
tion with the Sun in Leo influences much po\ver and honour to the na..
tive by virtue of the Sun, &c. So if Saturn be in conjunaion with Ju-
piter in Sagittary, the houfe of Jupiter,. then Saturn ac1s in dependaoee
to his difpofitor. Any planet ftrong in a good houfe is of good fign ifi-
. . · cation,
0 f4' A S T I~ 0 L 0 G Y. a73·
tation, but much better if the ph1nct be a fortunate one by nature. A,
tnalefic planet, \Veak in the tenth honfe, denies honour, if they behold
either the cufp or the lord thereof by nny malevolent afpeCl; then many
jrnpediments or obftruetions prejudice or hinder the.native'.s advancement.
lVlars in tho tnid.heavco, firong, ufually portends military pcefe1ment,
dignity; or profcliion.
· Saturn or Mars, ftrong in a goad boufc of a figure, are as difcords in
n1ufi~, corretl:ed to effect a concord or harmony in founds; for, being
\veil affeCted, they caufe a perfeCt good, though it be attended with dif-
ficult n1eans or n1etbods to accompany it. In fine, their good is always
terupered \Vith fomething of evil, becaufe they are n~turally tnore propenfe
to effect evil than good; as for exan1ple, Saturn .in the fecond houfe, or
lord thereof, and firong, gives riches by rapine and covetoufnefs ; in the
feventh he denotes the death of the wife. A malefic plJnet 1neanly af-
fected in a good houfe oftentimes obftruCl:s or prevents what is naturally
fignified thereby, or at heft but meanly e1feCl:s a good. As for example,
Saturn meanly affeeted; v.iz. peregrine in the fecond houfe, gives not
riches, yet tetains thern when gathered by being fparing and penurious.
Mars fo pof1ted and ill-efFected, diffipates or deftroys an efiatc by prodi-
gality, and fuch other in1prudent expences. Saturn, debilitated in .the
eleventh houfe of a nativity., produces trouble \vith or by the means of
friends unrelated ; and the analogy is according to the debility of the
planets, and how they are beheld, and rnitigated by fextiles and trines, or
conrrarily in£larned by quartiles or oppofit~ons.
-
An infortune in conjuntlion \Vith a fortunate planet, is either impeded
or deprived of the good fign ified ; for, though the fortunate planet be in
his own houfe, yet he partakes fomething of the nature or analogy of
the malefic, wi.th \Vholn he is conjoined. ,Three planets or n1ore in
conjundio_
n, act jointly and fevera1Iy according to their refpeCl:ive na-
tures, and to their heavenly fiates, but principally acco:-ding to the nature
and finte of the moll: firong and ruling planet. If an infortune, efpccia1ly
Saturn, be placed between two planets which are in conjunQ:ion, he pre..
vents or retards the good. promi fed by the other t\\·o planets ; the nature
or kind thereof is difcovered by the houfe of heaven \vherein fuch a con...
grefs is made.
The lord of the nfcendant applying to the conjunCtion of the ~un in
any nativity, ilie\VS the native apt, or delights to converfe \Vsth honour-
able perfons, grandees, and fuch- like; as al fo will be ~u11 bitious of fan1e,
honour, and dignity, &c. If he apply to Saturn, the ~ative affeCts to

nativity, is of eminent ·import; adding to the feltp.-ity. of a·native, and this
is the more powcrful ·if they arc applying to the ~onj unCtion of the ~artb ;

The. ART of R~SOLVING HORARY QYES'fiONS.
\
I T is an obfervation moil: true, that all people endued \Vith reafon nre
felicitous to know their future .efrate and condition; but, as fome
perfons find it impoffible to procure the exaCt time of their birth; afi:ro-
1ogy fupplies that defea by the doctrine of Horary Quefiions. So that
from a quefl:ion ferioufly propounded almo!l: as much fatisfat1ion n1ay be
given the querent, upo~ many fubjeCl:s of enquiry, as if his nntivity \vere
actually known. For, as the nativ_ity is the time of the ~irth of the body,
the horary queftion is the time of the birth of the n1ind; and there are
fe\v perfons living but arc in fome way or other (ubjeet to horary doubts,
which, being ferioufly propounded in the lhape of a queftion, may be fatis-
faCl:orily refolved. This doCtrine feems to be founded upon that 1niraculous
fympathy in nature, which is adrnirably manifefted between the I\1oon
and the Sea; by \vhich that an1azing body of \Vater is conftantly drawn
after her, though no man fees, or can conceive, how. In thefe ryn1pa-
thies there can be no doubt but the vcgetive foul of the \Vorld invifibly
curries and unites a fpecific virtue from the heavens bet\v~en one thing
:1nd another, .every where \Vor'king thofe fecret efforts, \Vhich no mortal
can fail to admire. And in the prefent cafe, \Vho is to Jetero1ine \Vhat
this foul cannot effect between the heavenly bodies and the nnimal
fpirit of 111an wotking fuch fympathies, as that a q uell:ion of itnpor-
tnnce to our \Velfare cannot fiart from the mind but in a point of ti1ne
wheri the planets and figns governing the perfon's birth. and acting up-
on the very fubjeB: that engages his thoughts and attention. And henc.e

that fkJl_l ,in nat'ural pr~dictions by which the ~rtift is enf-~led to den~on­
ftrate the ~ parti<.~ulars of the event required; and this as well by the ·fl:~rs
of heaven as Abiathar the prieft was of old enabled to do by the ftars of
the ephod. · '
'
:apr, hoyr~ver, th~ ·prediC1i9ns that are made from the·quefiionary way
are by no ineans fo p~rfe(t and CorreCl: as thofe deduceg from n~tivities;
and therefore I re·cort1mend ·all judgments of futurity to be' inade froni
- nativities, when they can be procured, rather than from horary queftions.
But at the farne time I am very confident that the omnifcient Creator is not
at all wanting-for any .poffibl~ care ip his contriv;ance gf the works of nature~
for the fupply of all our moderate_wants anti enquiries. ~nd, if it be ef-
fential to tnan's ~elfare ..to be forewarned of the tilne and tht judgnJent1 as
Solon1on declares it is, and 'that the wife man foal/ know it*, then it is
plain that God, has afforded tneans to obtain this knowledge without a
01iracle; and this means ii1ay fure!y b~ ~y tpe ll:ars.of I]e~v~n, refpooding
our horary queftions; and experience continually affirtns, day by day, that
it ~s fo. Not tha~ I believe the t!ivial.concerns and accidents of mankind,
as·fo1ne write~s have pretended, m~y be thus deduced, as if a glove, loft·
or hidden ·in 'fport and wa~ntonriefs, ·fhouJd be .fo watched and attend~d by
the he~venly intelligencers, that 'they nluft needs point o.ut where this
piece 9f leatl1er ~'vere ·to be found; or that ·quefiions propound~p ~~_ut ~f
mere curiofity ot diverfioo are to be refo!ved by t~em. .No; G.od,~ works
are ferious, and not to ~e made the'f.P.ort an·d ~idicule of the.gay and jncon- ·.
fiderate. For, although the ~eav~nly contriva·nce:may aptly r~fpop.d ~our
· ferious and im p·ortant concerns, as when.;Dav.id ~nxioufly ·defired to ~know
'lvhether hefhould go up into any oftthe cities 'ifJ:udah, ant/ which if them~
yet that they lhould as aptly fatisfy our intempera~e defires, ·~nd be fub-
fervient to our frolics, is too ridiculous ·tO imagine; There is 'no doubt
but the !heavens are able ·to 'lhew us more learning than we·~o~tals, in
this (tate of frailty and corruption, can -ever attain···to underfland.; and )it
is a great bounty of God that \Ve know fo much as we do; therefore
it ·highly becomes every wife and good man -to glorify the Maker of all
things for the little knowledge he can·and doth attain, and sto be carefQl
how he fports even with the 1leaft among his gracious works. ·
I I
All enquiries that are ferious, and that come under the denomination
of an horary queftion, muft neceffarily relate either to things pajl, prifent~
or to come; or to concerns that ·once were, now.are, or Jnay be bereajier;
.and the anfwer to fuch qlleftions muft ·be either effential or acciCfenta}.
The e1fential anfwer is alt.vayS'·one of· th~ i three things following, to wit~

thnt the n1ntter concerning whi'ch the enquiry is made, is firfi, to be, or '
not to be; fecond, either good or bad; nnd third, either true or fa!ft.
Therefor~, if the quc:ll:ion be teal, and the matter rightly ll3ted, the
true an{\ver, which is always Lltort, will be eafily difcovcred by the fol-
lowing rules. The accidental nnf\ver is th:tt \vhich appertains to the
accidents of the bufinefs in hand; and is always defined by where, whe11,
~o'lo, or wby. And whoever attempts to extend his judgment beyond
thefe limits, firains art beyond its bounds, and forces it to fpeak that
\vhich it is tota1ly incapable bf~ ..and. by this rncans many pretenders to
Afrrology fail egregioufly in their undertakings. To avoid this, let the
foJiowing queries be attended to.
Q.lJERY I. !J the Suqjefl ofE11quiry toot, or not to /Jt? ·
Here the firft thing to be attended to is the perfeCl:ion or defiruCl:ion
of the matter undet confideration. The perfection or ~ompletion ot the
fubject of enquiry may be effeCted fou.r (everal ·ways, viz. by the ap-
plication, tranfiation; reception, and pofition, of the planets ; and thefe
are deter~ined and defined by the proper and refpective fignifi_
cators of
the fubj.ects of enqui~~~ which are, firft, the lords of tbofe houfes \Vhich
relate to the matter 1n ·h.and ; fecondly, planets near the cufps of thofe
houfes; thirdly, p1aMls \e~alt_ed or dignified t~erein; and fourthly, the
confignificntors of thofe h~fcs. T~e lords of t.he houfes are thofe planets
which are lords· of the figri~~\Q~t happen to falf upo,n the cufpsr: of the
houfes. The., confignificators··~f· eacli houfe are as follow : of the firfl:
houfe or afcendant, Saturn and M~rs; of the lecond; Jupiter and Venus;
of the thir~, ·Mars and Mer'cury; of .the fourth, Sol and L.una ; of the
fifth, Venus· and Sol; of the fixth1 Mercury alone; of the feventh, Lu-
na and Venus; ~-f the eighth, ~atur~ ..~n~ ~ar~; ?f th"'~ ninth, jupiter
alone 1 of.thc tenth~ lVIars ap~ $!\turn; ·of the eleventh, Sol andr Saiurr(;:
nnd of the· twelftb,··.,Yenus and Jupiter• . From; hence it appears that
ea~h honfe hath a prirrlary and fecoudary co~figniticator; the firft \vbere-
of arifcs from the order ~f, the ·planets, the Ot~er from the order of the
figngJ ·
The confideration of the matter piopofed 1s taken from that hou(e
which hath relation to, and lignification of, tfle fan1e; and this figni-
fictttion of the houfes is either ·fimple o~ compound. The fimple fig-
nification of the boufes is that which hath relation fingly to the perfon
of the querent; compound lignification is that \vhich hath relation to
the matter or quefited. Tqp querent is he or lhe that aiks the quefi:ion _.
the matter, ot quefited, is ..~th~t about \v.hich the quefiion is propofeJ.
The fimple fignifications of the houfes ar~ as follo\V : the .firft h.oufo

tbird, his kindred, neighbours, and fi1ort jo'Urneys ; the fourth, his grave,
father, and 1ands ; the fifth, his pleafures and offspring; the fixth, his
fickoefs, fervants~ and fmall cattle; the feventh, his wife, public ene..
mies, and 1aw-fuits; the eighth, his death, and legacies·r the.ninth, his
religion, long voyages, and learning.; the tenth, his 1nothe:, trade, and
honour; the eleventh, his friends .and hopes; the twelfth, hi$ private
enemies, great cattle, itnprifonmen~, and crofres. The con1 pound figni-
fication is derived-from the fimple, by confidering what houfe that is
which fignifies the matter or quefited; and accounting that, be it what-
foever hoi1fe it may, for i..s afcendant or firft houfe; and fo afcr'ibing
the fignification of the firft houfe of the figure to it : doing in like man-
ner to all t~e otber houfes,in order. So that, if a quefiion relates to a bro-
ther or relation, the third· houfe is then his afcendant or firft houfe, and
fjgnifies his life and perfon; the fou~th houfe (which is in this cafe his ·
fecond) his fu bftance or' eftate·; · the fifth hou{e (his third) his relations
and lhor~ journeys; the fixth (his fourth) his father; the feventh his chil-
dren'; the eighth his ficknefs; .the ninth his wife, &c. and the fame of all
o.thers. Thefe things being laid as a· foundation, \Ve now come to ihew
the perfeCtion of the matter by the differen~ afreClions of the afped:s.
Application is \Vhen two planets haften to conjunCtion or afpeet of one
a_
nother. The light planets only apply to the more weighty. So Saturn
applies tp ~one~ Jupiter only to Saturn; Mars to Saturn and Jupiter;
So) to Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars; Venus to Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and,. _
Sol; Mercury to Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, and Venus, and Luna to
them all. But, if any of the higher planets be retrograde, they may then
apply to a lighter by retrogradation. Thus Saturn may apply to Jupiter,
Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, or Lunal Jupiter to Mars, Sol, Venus,
¥ercury, or Luna; M~rs to Sol, Venus, Mercury, or Luna; Venus to
Mercury, or Luna; and 1\'fercury to Luna, ·when retrograde. In this
application the lords of each houfc are not only to be confidered, but alfo
the confignificators of the fame·; for, if they alfo apply together by good
afpet1, we may give the more probable judgment. -Thefe applications
n1ay be always' difcerned by the Ephemeris; wherein may not only be
feen when the Moon applies to any afpeCl, but alfo when any of the other
planets apply to one another.
Tranfiation is when a planet feparates frotn the body or afpect of one
planet, and imn1ediately applies to the conjunttion or afped: of another.
And the planet tranflating is always lighter, except in retrogradation,
than the planets from or to whom the tranfiation is made. So Luna
may ~ranflate the light of the other planets from one to another; Mercury
~ay tranfiate the.Hght of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, and Venus, fro1n
' one
OF AS T R 0 L 0 G Y.
one to nnother; Venus the light of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and Sol, from
one to another,; Sol the light of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, from one to
another; Mars the light of Saturn and Jupiter, from one to another; hut
Jupiter :loci Saturn, \Vithout retrogradation, can make no tranOation. 1~his
tranflation is to be confidered between the lords of the houfes lignifying
the tnatter., the planets near the cufps, and the confignificators of the
fame. SoJ if the queftion belong to the feventh houfe, and Sagittarius be
on the afcendant, then Jupiter is lord of the afcendant, and Mercury of
the feventh; Saturn is the firfl: confignificator of the afcendant, nud Mars
the fecond; Luna is the fidl: confignificator of the feventh, and Venus is
the fecond. And, if the tranflation be between Jupiter and Mercury, o-r
Saturn and Luna, or Mars and Venus, it n1ay poffibly perforrn the matter;
but, if there be a tranflation between then1 all, as alfo between planets
pofited near the cufps of the houfes, the thing will undoubtedly be
brought to pafs, the fame as by application. A more weighty planet may
alfo rnake a tranflation by feparating in retrogradation from a \Veightier ·
than himfelf, and applying to a lighter than hin1felf. So Jupiter, being
retrograde, may feparate fro~ Saturn or his afpea, and tranflate his light
and virtne to Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, or Luna.
Reception is either fingle or mutual. A l-ingle reception is \vhen but
one of the fignificators receives the other into his dignities, viz. his houfe,
exaltation, or triplicity; this is but of fmall force, and is called difpofi-
tion. Mutual receptio.n is when two planets are in each other,s dignities;
as Mars in Gemini, and Mercury in Aries. This reception is threefold,
either by houfe, exal~ation, or triplicity. By houfe, \vhen Saturn is in
the houfes of Jupiter, and Jupiter in the houfes of Saturn. By exaltation,
as when Saturn is in Aries, the exaltation of Mars; and Mars in Libra~
the exaltation of Saturn. By triplicity. as when Saturn is in Leo, the
triplicity of Mars, and Mars in Taurus, the triplicity of Saturn. There
is alfo another reception of dignities; and that is when one planet is in .
another planet's houfe, and that planet in the other,s exaltation or tripli-
city. As Saturn in Taurus, the houfe of Venus, and Venus in Libra, the
exaltation of Saturn, or in Virgo, his triplicity. Thefe receptions are re-
markably firong and forcing, if they fall either in the antifcions of each
other, or in or near each other•s fextile or trine.
Pofition is when either the lords of two houfes concerned, or the
confignificators of the .fame, or both, are pofited in each other's houfes ;
or the lord of the afcendJn t, or its confignificator, or both, are pofited
in the houfe fignifyt ng the thing; or, laftly, when the lord or configni-
ficators of the houie i!gnifying the thing are pofited in the afcendant~
x s~

AN ILLUSTRATION
So, 'if the queflion belongs to the medium creli, if the lord of the 1lfcen-
dant be found in the medium creli, or lord of the mediurn ccel.i iri the af-
cendant, or in mutual pofition, it perfetl~ the thing delired.- This pofi..
tio'n is eminent, and, jf the faid .fig~i.ficators be pofited in.the antifcions
or otber dignities of each other, or of the planets lignifying the thing, it
abfolutely denotes the full comp~etion of it; more efpecially if the faid
fignificators by pof1tion are in fextile or. trine to each other; or to Jupi-
ter, Sol, or Yenus, or to lords of good houfes.· The· power of antifci.:
, ons are eq~al to a fextile or trine, chieily if they fall 'near tbofe points,
or in the dignities ~f their proper planet, or both. Thefe antifcions are
to be confidered in all the ways aforefaid ; to wit, in application, tranf-
lation, .reception, and pofition, in which they effeCt much more than
otlier\vife could be imagine~. If there be application of one or both fig-
nificators, though to no afpea, but to the·antifcion of the other fignifi-
cators; or reception by antifcion with good afpeCl:, or a real pofition
in antifcion of the one, with a good tranilation to the other fignificator,
it perfeRs things beyond expectation. And thus, by any or all of the
foregoing circurnftances, may the fubjeCl: of enquiry be brought to pafs,
and completed. {
.The matter is deftroyed by prohibition, which is when the fignifica-
·
tors are applying to an afpect, and before they can come to that afpea,
the lighter or applying planet comes to the conj unclion or afpect of ano-
ther; which planet deftroys ·what is defired. Or by fruftration, .which
is when fignificators are coming to an afpeB:, the more"\¥eighty planet,
before they can make that afpett, meets with the conjunction or afpeEl:
of another .planet, and thereby frufirates the former afpeB:. Or by re-
franation, which is when two fignificators are coming to an afpeCl:, and,
before they can make that afpeCt, the applying planet falls retrograde,
if direCl:; or, if retrograde1 he becomes direct before he can n1ake the faid
a~ed. ·
Things are alfo defiroyed by afpecr, which is when the fignificators
apply to the quartile or ·oppofition of one another, without reception ;
o-r by the conjunCtion of the Sun, which is called combuftion, and is the
greateft affiitlion of all. Alfo by fepara~ion, which is, when the figtiifica-
tors of the querent, and thing propofedj have lately been in afpetl, and are
tiewly feparated, though never fo little; and this denotes the full and
abfolute defirucl:ion of the matter, which we feldom or ever find to fail.
The quality of the a.fpeCl: likewife a1ews the condition of the thing or
matter lately pa1Ted, if it was good, good; if evi), evil; and it is either
totally deftroyed, or at leall: brought to p·afs with n1uch difficulty, if the
tranfiation be made by quartile or oppofition. But more efpecially if

nnother planet at the L1n1c time fl1all tranflate the virtue or light of both
fignificators to Saturn or Mars, or to the lords of evil houfcs.
If there be a tronflation bet\veen the fignificators by quartile or oppofi ..
tion, or by fextilc or trine, and, before the tranfiation can be made, one
or both of the fignificators lhall go ·into another fign, the matter \\'ill
con1e to nothing. If there be prohibition, frufl:ration, refranation, evil
afpeEt, feparation, or evil tranflation, by quartile or oppofition, \vithout
n1utual reception, it is enough to defrroy the nlatter, but n1ore efpecially
jf fo&ne or all of them happen to be in fixed figns, and in a fucccdent or
cadent houfe of the figure, or fro1n the houfe fignifying the thing. Move-
able figns are Aries, Ca.
ncer, Libra, and Capricorn; fixed 11gns are T au-
rus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquaries; con1mon figns ~re Gemini, Virgo, Sa-
gittary, and Pifees; angles are the firfi, fourth, feventh, and tenth ; foe-
cedents are the fecond, fifth, eighth, and eleventh, houfes a. cadents are
the third, fixth1 Qinth, and t\velfth1 houfes.
Q_U E R Y II. II the Matter gopd or evil?
Confider the houfe to which the thing belongs, its lord, and planets
therein; and the houfe fignjfying the matter of the end, its Jord, and pla-
nets therein; and, if the houfe fignifying the thing be fortified by the
prefence or bcan1s of good planets, or en1inent fixed fiars of the firll or
fecond n1agnitude, or if the Dragon's Head be there, it !hews good, but
the contrary, evi ). · The fan1e more particularly, if the lord of the houfe
1ignifying the thing be angular, firong, and e!fcntially fortifi.ed; or in
good afpeet to the cufp of that houfe tignifying the rnatter of the end, its
lord, or planets p~fii:ed 'therein; but ·Jhe contrary, evil. '
.r •
Like\vife mutual pofition or reception, and the figni;ficators in good af-
pca \Vith the fuperior planets, or planets more \Veighty than themfelvcs,
are all teil:imonies of good. But the fignificator of the thing peregrine:.
flo\v in mo~ion, retrograde, or feparated from the lord or planet in the
houfe lignifying the n1~tter of the end, ·are all fignificators of eyil. 'fhe
houfe fignifying the n1atter of the end is always that which relates to the
thing or things expeCted from the quell:ion propofed; for example, if the
quefl:ion was, Is it good to ren1ain ? here the end of the ..query is to be un-
derfiood, whether it be for health, wealth, prefennent, or the like: if for

..Q:.U E ·R Y IV. Where, or which Way?
· Wherever the fignificator is, there is the thing; the ho~fe where the
:fignificator is pofited ihews the quarter of heaven, or point of the com-
pafs; which way the thing 1nay be. If the houfe and fign cohere, this
judgment is {o much the more finn ; if they difagree, conflde.r the pofi..
tion'of the Moon, and \Vith what 1he agrees moft, and give judgn1ent
from her. If the .Moon agrees neither with the fign nor houfe in which·
the fignificator is pofited, then confider the part of fortune in the fame·
nlanner as before you co~fidered the M~on, and accordingly judge. And.
if this anfwers not, confider lafily the difpofitor of the Part of Fortune,
and ·determine by th~t.
The difl:ance is difcovered from the proximity or diftance of the fignifi-~
cators to body or afpect, confidered as they may happen to be either an-
gular, ~uccedent, or cadent, refpect being had to their latitude, whether
little or great, north or f~uth. Great latitude ihews obfcurity, and great

difH.culty in finding '"'hat is fought for: if .the latitude be north, it ihe\VS
di111culty on1y, not i n1pofli bili ry ; but, if fouth, then a1l the Iabour of
fet.·king will be in vain, unlefs the fignificators be angular and near in af-
pect. Angles fignifying nearneCs; fucccdents farther off; and cadents
l>cyond thought or ituagination.
The figni!1cator angular nnd \vithout latitude ·thews fome paces; if it
hath north latitude, fon1c furlongs difiant; if fouth, fotne miles. The
fign ificator fucceden t and \Vi thou t latitude !he\vs fome furlongs ; if it
l1ath north latitude, io:11C 1niles; if fouth, fotne leagues. The fignifi-
cator cadent and \Vithout latitude !hews [orne 1niles; if it hath north la-
titude, fome leagues; if fouth, fame degrees. But thefe rules are chiefly
to be confidcred in things having life; the former give the kno\vledge of
the \~"ay aud difhtnce in general, and the lltter meafure it out difiin·:lly
by nun1bcrs. • If it be required to know th.e true nun1ber of paces,
furlongs, •niles, leagues, or degrees, of difiance, confider the number of
degrees and minutes between the body or afpeCl: of the fignificarors,
and ·according tp the nuanber of degrees \Vhich are between the conjunc-
tion, fcxtile: quartile, trine, oroppofition, [o many paces, furlongs, n1iles,
leagues, or degrees, is the thing fought after diftant from the place from
\Vhcnce it \Vas lofi, or from the perfon making enquiry. · And, fo m:1ny
minutes as adhere to the degrees, fo tnany fixtieth parts of the fame de-
non1ination of the meaiure \vhich one degree fignifieth are to be accounted
and added to the forther nun1ber.

Q_U E R Y V. When, or in 'lobat Ti111e?
.The limitation of time is taken, firfily, by houfe and fign; fecondly, by
afpeCt; thirdly. by.tranfit; or, fourthly, by direCl:ion. 'fhe firfi: _
three are
ufed in horary queil:ions, or elections; the two laft only in nativities
and annual revolutions. If the fignificator hath Iatitude, the meafure of
time hath ·its litnitation from houfe and ftgq. Whether things are to be
brought to pafs or, dellroycd, the time, if it be fignified by the houfe and
fign, mu!l: be confidered as the fignificator is angular, fuccedent, or ca-
dent, having moveable, fixed, or conHnon, figns. Angles fignify the
fudden pcrforn}aoce of the 1nattcr; fuccedents, long time and \Vith much
difficulty; cad~nts, fcarcely at all, or at leafl: \vhen all hopes are pall, and
with care and vexation. Angles fignify, if they ha.ve moveable figns,
fome days ; if ..cornmon figns, fame weeks ; and, if fixed figns, fome
months. Succe~ents fignify, if they have n\ovcable figns, fotne months;
if comn1on figns, fame years ; and, if fixed. figns, when aJI hopes are pafi.
if at all. If It be required to know the certain uumber of days, \Veeks,
months., or years., confider the nun1 ber of degrees and minutes bet.\Veen

pofition, fo n1any da)'S, \veeks, rnonths, or years, lh~ll 1t be before the
n1atter enquired after thall be fully accomplilhed or quite defiroyed.
· Great· fouth latitud~ often prolongs the time beyond the fonner lin1ita..
tion; north latitude often cuts it lhortcr; but, if the fignificators have
no latitude, the limitation of time is made fimply by the afpect.
. .
...
The tirne fignificators meet by afpett is found out in the-Ephemeris ;
to wit, the month and day thereof in .whi.ch' the fignificators tneet. Tran-
fits thew the progrefs of the matter, whether the fignificators have lati-
tude or not, and point out the moft probable tirpes in which the .matter
may be forwarded or impeded.
' In obfervations of tranfits, the figure mufl: be dra\vn into a fpeculum.
Find what configurations, viz. what conjunCtion or afpeet, .. it is by
which the tnatter may be brought to pafs, or defirpyed; and,' lafi:Jy, ob-
ferve in the Ephemeris when the chief fignificators come in the fan1e
figo, degree, and minute; for that is the tirne in w.hich the matter will
be completed• . And by the tranfits in the fpeculum may confiantly be
found the good and evil days that effect the ·n1atter, until it is either per-
feEted or becon1e fruftrate. . ·
Q_U E R Y VI. How or why?
The planets which xnake the prohibitioQ or frufiration, whether by
good or evil afpett, are the hurting, deltroying, or impediting, planets; to
wit, .the planets that fignify he, lhe, or that thing, \Vhich iliall hinder
or deil:roy the bufinefs. The man, wornan, or thing, is difcovered from
the impediting planet, by confidering what houfes h~ is lord of, and
what he is pofited in. The houfe he is lord of denotes the quality or
relation of the man, woman, or thing ; the houfe he is pofited in, the
matter; and the houfe in which the prohibition or fruftration happens,
the caufe or reafon.
'
- If the impediting planet is lord of the Cecond houfe, it is a rnatter of
eftate; if the third houte, kindred, neighbours, &c. if of the fourth
houfe, inheritances or fathers; if of the fifth houfe, gaming, p1eafures,
children;~ if of the fixth houfe, ficknefs, fervants, {mall cattle; if of the
feventh hou fe, ~enen1ies, law·- fuits, wives; if of the eighth hou fe, lega-
cies, wives portions, death; if·of the ninth houfe, religion, churchmen,
voyages at fea, arts, fcien,ces ; if of the tenth houfe, mothers, great 1nen,
trade, honour, offices, ·Clnploytnents; if of the-eleventh houfe, hopes,
friends,
0 F AS T R 0 L 0 0 Y. ~
:!:>7
friends, ncquaintancc ; if of the t\velfth houfc, great cattle, difcafe!J,
private enemies, imprifonment, &c. Then confider \vhether the pla-
net is good or evil, mafculine or feminine, or whether in a mafculine
or feminine fign and houfe, and accordingly judge of the etfeCls more
remifs Or exa8, as they may be brought to pafs either by man, WOtnan,
or thing; judging a]ways in .this cafe by the fuperior tefiimonies. And
obferve, lafi:ly, that, whatfoever has been faid of the impediting or hin-
dering planet, the fame is to be underfiood of the planet adjuvant, or
helping.
The next thing, to be confidered, is the propriety of the quell:ion pro-
pofed, and the f1ncerity of the querent ; for it fometimes happens that
queftions are }lnproperly and incorret1ly. fiated; and at others, that they
are put through knavery and impertinence, with a view to injure and
difgrace the arti!l. In thefe cafes, the quefiion not being radical, no
anfwer can be obtained; and therefore he who atte~pts to refolve th.en1
will bring lhame upon himfc:lf, and difgrace upon the fcience. Every
quefiion, to be radical, muft be fincere and natural; and, unlefs they are
fo~ they cannot be refolved. 'J herefore, to afcertain their fincerity on
the one hand, and their fitnefs or unfitnefs on the other, the following
rules muO: be obferved.
EreCl: the figure as before direB:ed ; and, if the fign afccnding and the
planet in the afcendant defcribe exaCl:ly the perfon of the q uerent, the
queftion is radical, and fit to be judged. But, if either the very begin-
ning or extreme end only of the _fign afcends, it wiH not be proper to
give judgment ; for it denot~s the querent to be a knave, and the quefiion
a forgery, propofed merely out of ridicule and intecnperate mirth. This
rule I have often verified in practice, by directly charging the querent with
fuch defign ; and the effeCt this unexpeCted. difcovery had upon them h~s
ufually produced an acknowledgment of it; The fatne thing is indicated
by the quartile or oppofition of the Moon with the lord of the feventh
houfe; or by the Moon being void of courfe, or combuft; which pofitions
likewiie denote the queftion to be improperly and incorreCtly fiated. Sa-
turn in the afcendant, impedited and afHitled, 1hews the quefiion propofed
to be either falfe, or without ·ground, or the fubjefr of it pall: hope ; and
whenever the lord cf the afcendant is found combufl: or retrograde, it in-
dicates the fame thing, and fhews the quefiion is propofed to anfwer fon1c
abfurd or knavifu purpofe~ and therefore not to be n1eddled \Vith.
Any quefl:ion may be deemed radical, when the lord of the afccndant
.and the lord of the hour are of the fame nature and triplicity. Thus,
fuppofe Leo afcends upon the horofcope at the time the quefiion is pro-
No. 14. 3 Y pofed,

.
pofed, and Mars happens to be lord of the hour, the queftion will be
radical, becaufe the Sun, VJhich is ·lord of the horofcope, and Marst a're
of one nature• viz. hot. and dry. So, if Jupiter · be lord of the hour,
the queftiotl will be radical, becaufe the Sun and Jupiter ~re of the fame
triplicity; and this obfervation extends.to all the other plan~ts, a':ld uni-
formly lh~ws the quell.ion proper to ·be juHg~d.' But, whenever the tef-
timonies or fignificator~ in the figure are found equal.ly ftrong · for and
againfi: the matt~r p~opounded, it ought not to be adjudged; for the artift
knows not which way the balance may yield, and therefore judgment
fuould be deferred to a future time. ,
. .. ._,._ , ..
There is one·rule by which the radicalnefs of a quefl:ion may be afcer..
tained with great certainty, or at leafl: with lefs probahility of ·mif-
take than by any other; and this is by the moles with which every
perfon is more or lefs marked. · It is rea11y an aftonithing fact, and no
lefs extraordinary than true, that thefe moles or marks are all uniformly
diftinguilhed by the f1gns and planets which prevail at the time of birth,
if not·abfo1_
ute1y produced by them. It \Vas the truth and univerfality
of this obfervation which fir,ft Jed •to the difcovery of that affeCtion and
government which the celell:ial figns have upon the ditf<!rent men1bers of
man's body; a faa fo obvious, that, notwithftanding all endeavours to
refute the idea of plane~ary. io.fluence, yet this fact is annually recorded
i'n every alrnanac, and finds a. place in almoft every other aftronornical
publication.
According to this rule, whenever a perfon comes to propound a que(
..
tion, let a figure of the tw~lve boufes be erctl:ed for the querc:nt; then
note what fign is upon the cufp of the afcendant, and in the.p·lrt of the
querene·s body which tbat fign governs, if the quell:ion be radical, the
querent will have a mo]e.. J«".or inftanc~, if Aries be the fign afct:nding
at the ti,ne, the mole will be on the head or face; if Taurus, on the neck
or t-hroat; if Gemini, on the artns or fhoulders; if Cancer,.on the hr~att;
and fo upon any other part of the body ·\vhich the fign afcending lhall
govern. 0 bferve I)ext, i_n which of the twelve houfes the lord of the
afcendant is pofited, and in that part of the body the fign governs which
happens to fall upon the cufp of that houfe will the querent have another
n1ole. Next ob{erve the figo defcending on the cufp of rhe fixth houfe,
and in whatever part of the body, that fign governs the querent will find.
another mole; and upon that member alfo which is figni5ed by the fign
wherein the .lord of the fixth houfe is pofited will be found another.
O.bferve alfo what fign the Moon is pontcd in, and in that part of the
body which is .governed by it 1ha11 the native or q uerent find another
.m.~le. .If the planet Saturn be the fignificator, the mole is either blac!'
~ 3~ or
0 F AS T R 0 L 0 G Y.
or of a dork colour; if Mars be fignificator, and in a fiery lign, it then re-
fcmbles a fear, cut, or dent in the fle(h; but in any other fign it is a red
mole. If Jupiter be the figoificltor, the rnole is of a purple or bluilh
cnfi; if the Sun, it is of nn olive or chefnut colour; if Venus. it is yc:l-
lo\v; if Mercury, of a pale J;)Jd colour; if the Moon, it is whitilh, or
participJtes of the colour of that planet with which lhc happens to be in
afpett. And, if rhe planet which gives the mole be 1nuch intpt!dited or
afflicted, the mark or mole will be larger ~od 1nore vifible.
.
If the fign and pllnet \Vhich gives the mark or mole be mafculine, it
is then 1ituatcd on the right fide of the body'; but if fen1inine on the
left fide. If the fignificator or planet which gives the lnole be found a-
bove the horizon, that is, from· the cufp of the afcendant to the cufp of
the leventh, either in the twelfth, eleventh, tenth,· ninth, eighth, or fe-
venth, houfe, the mark or 1nole will be on the fore part of the body; but
if the iigni6cator be under the earth, that ~s, in either; the firfi, fecond~
third, fourth, fifth, or fixth, houfe, it will be lituated on the· back
or hinder part of the body. If only a few degrees of the fign afcend upon
the horofcopc, or defcend on the fixth; or 1f the lord of the afcendant_,
Jord of the fixrh. or the Moon, be polited in the beginning of any ftgn;
the mole or mark will~ be found upon tht: upper part of the men1ber thofe
1igns govern. If hdlf the degrees of a fign afcend, or the· figoificators be
pofited in the: middle-of any fign, tbe cnark or Lnole. will be in the middle
of the men1ber; ·bur, if the )aft degrees of a fign afcend, or the figoifica-
tors are in the latter degrees of a fign, the mark or mole will then be fitll·
ated on the lowtr part of tbe member fuch fign governs•
.
If the queftion be radical, the time rightly taken, and the querent fin-
cere, aAd of fufficient age, thl:> rule \vill feldom or ever be found to fail.
In afcertaining the exaa tune of any perfon's nativity, I haye found it of
excellent ufe·; never having been once deceived by it in the fmallell: de-
gree. In cornpany i have frequently tried the experilneJ?t upon a ftran- ·
ger, and ever found it correfpond, to the 3fi:onilhment of all. perfons
prefent; and it is an experinltnt ~hich any read~r may eafily make upon
hin1felf or friends. But in the months of November and Decen1ber,
when figns of lhort afcenfions are upon the a(cendant, great care mufl be
taken to be exa8: in point of time; for in tbofe lnonths the Sun is fre...
quently not vifible, and clocks are not a·hYays to be. depended upon;
therefore without proper care the rit;ht afc~ndant may eafily be mifft:d,
for Pifces and Ari~s both afcend in the fpace of fifty minutes, and Aqua-
ries and Taurus in little lnore than an hour; but, if the rime be taken ex-
aCt, no one need ever mi!lruft the certainty of thefe rules, and the exaCt
conformity of the marks or moles to the figns and planets.\~l1ich repre-
fent
AN I L L U s·T R A T I 0 N
fent them. Thus, by looking.at a perfo,n•s nativity, and atten.ding to tbefe
rules, the reader may exaCtly point out and defcribe the l11oles in any partJ
, of the native's body, though if. be a perfon he never faw or converfed
. with; and, if he is correct to tin1e, he may fafely- venture his life upon
the matter. And by the fame kind of fimple, eafy, and certain, rules, are
all prediCtions in afirology managed; fo that, infl:ead of calling in the aid
of an'y fupernatural or. infernal compact, it only requires to b~ correCt to
time and calculation, and to know the true nature and influence of the
planets, and by thefe alone are the events and contingencies of futurity
demonfirated and foretold. ·
..
As thefe rules hold good upon the body of ev~ry querent, fo .will they,·
IJtUtatis tJJutandis, upon the body of thevquefited; for example, Suppofe
a perfoo enquires concerning a wife or fweetheart, then the feventh houfe
will be her firll: or.afcendant, and the twelfth her fixth;. and in thofe parts
of ·her body which the figns upon the cufps of thofe houfes govern lhall
lhe have moles ; and fo by the Moon and other fignificators. It ·is alfo
found by conll:ant obfervation, that an infortune pofited in the afcendant
always marks the face with amole or fear; for the afcendant or firfi houfe
ahvays reprcfents the face, let 'vhat fign foever afceod; ~he fcond tepre-
fents the neclt, the third the arms and lhou1ders, the fourth the breaft,
and fo on, every houfe and fign in order, according to its fucct.ffion. It
is alfo obfervable, that, if the Moon be in conjunction or oppofition of the
Sun, in.an evil afpeCl: to Mars, and in anguLL
r hou tes, the quen nt has a.
natural infirmity or blen1ilh in or near one of his eyes. 1"'hus having
lhewn how to difcover whether queftions are proper and radical, or not;
we £hall now direCt how to give j udgt:nlent upon them.

· Ofthe Le11gtb of the ff«jerent'.r Lift.
To rcfolvc this qucflion, obfcrvc the; fign afcending, the lord thereof, and
the Moon ; nnd if they are found f~t~e from the malignant beams of the
infortunes, or of the lords of the fourth, lixth, eighth, and t\velfth. lioufes,
and not cotnbuft, the quercnt's life \viii not be thort; and, if the fignifi- ·
caters are not affliCted by the prcfencc of violent fixed ftar3, it tnar be fiill
more prolonged ; but if the lord of the afcendant be combull and retro-
grade, and in an cv·il houfe of heaven, the querent is not likely to Jive
long. \Vhcn the fignificators arc unfortunately afpcCl:cd from good places
of the figure; or the benevolent planets interpofe their rays, the malevo-
lence threatened \Vi'Jl be fc>Ine\vhat nb<
ttcd; but if it he from evil houfes
in the fchen1e, and the benevolent planets atTord no help, danger of a·
ihort life is then alfo to be feared.
Of the Good or E'l-'1"1 attending Lift.
'l'he good and evil that attends each pcrfon, is diflinguifhed by the
· fortunate and unfortunate radiations in the figure, \Vhen benevolent pla-
nets poifefs the aicendant, or the principaI places of the figure, they in-
dicate much good to the qucrcnt through rhe 'vholc courfe of his life.
J\.nd if the lord of the afcendant and the Moon be friendly by the bean1s
of the fortunes, although frotn n1alignant places of the 1(:hetne, yet it
prefc1ges good to the native, inafmuch as an accidental c\'il cannot re·
-
b.lte or \Vith!ttnd an cffcntial good. But \vhen the infortunes po!fefs thefc
places~ or by evil clfpetl: affiiet the fign ificators, the querent will be 1tlb-
jed to a troubleioane life. If Saturn poffels the afcenclant, the querent
\Viii be anelancholy and penfive, and fubjcCl: to perplexities from. aged
tnen. If lVlnrs, he \Vill be choleric, and liable to oppre!lion by kna\·es
and f\vindlcrs; and fometin1es by the treachery of kindred ; if the Dra.~
gon's 'fail be in the afccndant, he \Vi11 never be free from fcandal and dif-
grace. \Vhcn the afflicting planets are lords of ~tnpropitious houfcs, the
evil "'ill be the longer durable; but \Vhen the afiifiing pJancts are lords of
good houfcs, the good \Viii be more pennanent. Note a1fo the houfcs.
thote planets govern ; for from thence is diicovered by \V.h:H n1eans the
qucrcnt {hall be fortun:lte or unh:tppy. i\nd, as tbc malignant beams of· ·
the evil planets prevent or cclipfe the good that is lignified; fo the bene\~o­
!cnt rays of the fortunate fiars reverberate much ·of the n1ifchief portended:
by duly confidcring 'vhich. according to the fl:rength of the planets nffifl-
ing or affiitl:ing; the extent of the good or evil that attends each querent's
life may be cafily afcertained. ·

A Perfon having a d¢re toJpeak ~vith another, foal/ heji11d hinJ at home?- ·
The truth I have al\vays found in the nnf\vers to this quefiion, princi-
pally induced tne ~o give it a place here; for I have often tried the ex-
peritnent both for myfelf and others, and have never knov;n it to fail.
'fhe rules are thefe : If you \Vould fpeak ~'ith a perfon that you have fa-
miliar and confiant dealings \vith, but are no \Vay related to, take the fc-
v:cnth houfe and his lord -to fignify him, that is the fevcnth fron1 the af-
cendant; for the afcendaqt al\Vays fignifies the querent. If the lord of the
feventh be in any of the four angles, viz. in the ·firft, fourth, fcventh, or
tenth, houfes, the perfon you \vould fpeak \Vith is cert!linly at hon1e. If
the lord of the 1eventh be in any of the fuccedent ~ houfes, viz. in the fc-..
conJ, .fifth, eighth, or eleventh, he is not then at home, but is near it,
and may, \Vith a little diligence, be found ; but if the lord of the fevenrh
be in any one of the cadent houfes, viz. the· third, fixth, ninth, or
t\velfth, the party i~ far from home, and confequently cannot be fpokcn
'"'ith if fought for. Lf the~lord of the afcendant apply to the lord of the
feventh by a friendly afpea at the tin1e of enquiry, the qucrenr ~nay
perhaps meet the qucfitcd, or accidentally hear of hitn by the \vay ; or, if
the ~loon or any other planet trnnsfer the light of the l~rd ·of the feventh
to the lord of the afcendant, it denotes the fame thing. 1·he n;tture· and
fex of the planet transferring the light, denotes \Vhat manner of pcrfon
1hal1 give notice to the quen:nt of the perfon he enquires after, acco:J-

ing to the fign and quarter he is p·ofited in. But, if the perfon enquired ,
after be a r~lation, then the lurd of the fcventh is not to be taken, but
the lord of that houfc \Vhich fignifies fuch relat-ion ; as, if it be a bro..
thcr, then the lord of the third rpuft be referred to·; if a father, regard
mufi be had to the lord of the f9urth ; if a fon or daughter, ~bferve the
lord of the fifth, and fo .on ; and according to their pofitions judge as
above fpecificd.
If ari ,ibfcnt Przrl)' be·derzd or alive.·
Herein al(o muft be confidered \vhat relatlonfhip the querent hath to the
party quefited, and take the fignificator accprding1y. But if there be no
relationfhip bet\veen them, then take the afcendant, his lord, and the
Moon, to fignify the party that is abient; and judge thus : If the lord of
the afcendant, or the ~Ioon, be in conjunction \Vith the_-lord of the eighth,
or a planet in the eighth, and no benevolent tefrimonies concur, the
nbfent party is certa)nly dead. Or' \vhen the Moon and the lord of the
afcendant, ·!hall b~ in oppofition to the lord of the eighth, fron1 the fe-
cond and eighth, or from the fixth and t\velfth houtes, the abfent pC:trty
is like\Vifc dead. If the lord of the afc~ndant be in the fourth, and the
Nloon in the feventh, in quartile to him, it fho\VS great danger to the _
qucGted, if not abfolute death. When- an -evil planet_i11all tranflate the
light of the lord of the eighth unto the lord of the afcendant, or .of the
lord of the afcendant to the lord of the eighth, ·it is mofl: probable the
abfent party is dead. If the lord of the aicendant and the Moon be in
the fourth houfe from the afcendant, or in the houfe of death, and either
con1butl or in their fall, or joined \vith the lord of the eighth, the party
quefited is undoubtedly dcceafed; but if none of thefe pofitions happen,
and on the contrary you find the Moon, and the afcendant, and hig lord,
flrong a~d \Veil fortified, the ab(ent party is alive and \Veil. 1f the lord
of the afcendant, or the Moon, feparatc frcrn the lord of the fixth, the
abfent party hath been lately fick; if from the lord of the eighth, he has
been in danger of deatl.
1; if from the lord of the t \\'elfth; he has been in
prifon, and fuffered mi1ch anxiety of mind. AI)d, by thus varying the
rule, his condition, ·according to the application and fcparation of the fig-
nificators, wiH be correctly found.

The -afccndant and the Moon are generally fignificators of the !hip, and
the burthen {he bears; but the lord of the a{ccndant is figniticator of the
rcrfons that fitil in her. And, if in a quefiion all tl}efe appear fortunate,
they denote profperity to the ihip; but, if on the._ contrary they are found
impeditcd and afHidcd, the ve!fcl and all in her are in in1minent danger, if
not abfo!utely loft. \Vhen a tnaJevolent planet, having dignities in the
eighth boufe, Qlall be found in the afcendant, or the lord of the afcend..
ant in the eighth, in evil afpeCt \Vith the lord of the eighth, t\velfth, fixth,
or fourth, houfe, ·or if the Moon be combuft under the earth, all thefc arc
indications of danger, and pre£1ge the 1hip either to be lofi, or in a very
dcfpcratc condition, But \vhen all the fignificators are free, and no \vay
impedited, it denotes the !hip to be in a very good and profperous con-
dition, and all the perfons and things on-board her. If the afcend~\nt and
the Moon be unfortunate, and the lord of the afcendant firong, and in a·
good houfe, it indicates the.fhip to be in an ill condition; but the men,
&c. that are on-board her, \Vill do well, and come home in fafety. But
· if the afcendant and the Ivloon ihall be fortunate, and the lord of the af-
cendant unfortunate, it fho\vs-that the vcfTcl \vill do well, or tpat it is in
fafety; but that her cre\v are in great danger of being defiroyed by fome
putrid difeafe, or of being taken by an enemy.
.
If any pcrfon enquires the fuccefs a !hip !hall have 'in ber voyage
upon her fetting fail, you muft then note the angles of the figure; and,
if the fortunate planets and the Moon (for !he is lady of the feas) are
found therein, and the unfortunate planets cadent, or in an abjeCt con-
dition, it forefho\vs the !hip and her Jading \vill go· very- tlfely unto the
intended haven ; but if the infortunes be in angles, or in fitccedent

fortune will fall upon that part of the fhip, perfon, or thing, in the fame,

:fignified bythe ngn \vh'ere the infortune is p~fiteJ'; and~ if the infor..
tune threatening this danger !11all be Saturn, the veffel will either be
fplit or funk, and moft of the cre\v either dto\vneJ, or fubject to many
hard!hips; but if the infortune be Mars, ·· and · he in any of his ef-
.fential ctignities, or afpecting ~ place \vhcre he hath firength, or pout-
ed in an earthy fign, he porten·ds the £1n1e tnifchief, \vith the additional
misfortune of the c~~.\:V being either taken by an encn1y; irnprifoned, or ·
ca.rried into flavery. But if the fortunes cafr their friend!y beams unto
either of the aforcfaid places, .and the lords of the angles, particularly of
the afcenda11t, and the difpofitor of the l\1oon, be free, it· denotes that
although the fhip fhall undergo much danJage, or be loft, yet the major.
part of the n1en and goods !hall be L1ved. But if Mars afflict the lords of , ,
the angles, and the difpofitor of the 1vloon, the men and the fhip will
be jn danger of pirate.s, or·of a public encLny. And, if any other evil af-
fetl:ions appear in the figns, there ~v il1 be quarrelling and C<?ntrntion, ·
or fome dangerous n1utiny, in the ihip ; and this \Viii chiefly happen \vhcn
the infortuncs are located in thofe figns \Vhich difpofe of the parts in the
. upper divifion .of the fhip. But, if Saturn affiiet in the fame tnanner as
al?ove recited of Mars, there will be rr1any difturbances in the ihip, but
.no bloodfhed, . And, if the infortunate figns fignify the bottom or lo\ver .
parrs of the ihip, it prefi1ges dro\vning by means of fame dangerous leak.
If fiery figns be in the mid-heaven, n.ear violent fixed !tars, and Mars
prove the afflicting planet, the !hip \Vill be burnt, either by fome acci...
dent \Vithin her, or by lightning, or by the £1lling of fotne inflan1mable
meteor. But, if Mars be in an human fign; the burning of the !hip \vill
be occafioned · by forne engagement \Vith an enerni ; and the danger
will begin in that part of _
the fhip fignificd. by the fign \vherein th~
infortune was placed in the figure. If Saturn be the threatening planet in-
fiead of Mars, and pofited in the mid-heaven, the vefiel \vill be caft away,
or damaged by the n1qtion of violent fionns and 'vinds, or by reafon of
leaks, or bad fails; and the danger \Vill be either ' greater or lefs~ in pro-
portion to'the dignity or·power of the .infortune, and his difiance from the
beams·of the benevolent planets.
If the 1ord of the afcendant in the figure be fortunate, the !hip !hair
return .with fafety and good fuccefs; .but, if he be unfortunate, the !hall ·
fuffer n1uch lofs and damage. If the lord of the eighth houfe fhall af-
.flicf the lord of the afcendant, or if the lord of the afcendant be in
the eighth, it den9tes the death of the captain or mailer of the !hip; or fon1e
of the .principal officers ' belonging to her. And if _the part of fortune
and part of fubltaoce,· and their lords, fhall be affiided, it denotes lofs
in the fale of the-goods that are in the Chip. ,But, if in!lead of this af-
fliction they 1h.all be in fortunat~ pofitions, it denotes much gain, and a

a long and tedious voyage ; more particulnrly if the Jorus of thofe places
be flow alfo: but, if the fign,iticators be quick in rnotion, the 1hip \Vill
make a fhorter or quicker voyage than n1ay he expected. If in the figure
there be cnrnity in the · pofirions bct\vccn rhc lord. of the afrendant and

tune fron1 the part of fortune, in cadent houfes, or in quartile or oppo-
fition, it pre1ages \Vant of neccffary provifions; and, if they be found in

Q_UESTIONS proper to the SECOND H-OUSE.
/
· The fccond houfe being the houfe of fubfiance, the quefiions proper to
it are as follo\v :
.
1. Sba/1 the ~erent be rich or poor?
2. By ~u.:hat 1neans./btJ!i he attain riches ?
3. The ttilie u:hen ?
4· Shall he obtain the goods or 111one;' lent?
5. Shall he obtain the wages orjlipend due to hinz ?
5'hall tbe ff<.gerent be rich or poor?
In-refo1ving·this que!tion, obferve the tign of the fecond houfe and its
lord, the planet or planets located therein, and calling their rays to the
cufp, or the lord thereof; the part of fortune a]fo, and its difpofitor; and
if all thefe fignificators are free, and affified by the bodies or afpccts of
the benevolent planets, the querent \Vill attain. a very confiderahle for-
tune; and fl1all cfcape poverty. But \V hen the .fignificators are affiid:cd,
and the fortunate fiars afford them no affi!lance, it denotes the perfon in-
terrogating will be poor all his life-time.. If the lord of the afccndant,
or the Moen, be joined to the lord of the houfc of fubfiance; or the lord
of the fevcnth houfe to the lord of the afcendant ; or if the lord of the
houfc of fubftance be pofited in the afcendant ; or if the lord of the af-
cendant, and the Moon, be in the houfc of fubfiance ; or if the Moon,

or any other planet, transfer the light of the lord of the fecond houfe to
the lord or the afcendant, or of the lord ofI the ·afcendant to the lord of
the fecqnd houfe 1 the querent will attain riches, and·live in good efieem, ·
acco.rding to .'his fitu~tion or.birth. But, if none of thefe pofitions hap-
p~n, tQen not~ Jupiter. the natural fignificator of fu:bfiance; or Venus,
who alf9 is a fortune;. or the Dragon's Head, _
which always portends
good; .ap~ if they be free from the ill beams of the infortunes, or happen
tQ be pofited in the houfe of fubfiance, the querent will mofl: certai!llY be
riel); and w~.Il bear great f\vay in the place \vhere he lives. When Saturn,
1\fars, or the D~agon 's Tail, are pofited in the fecond houfe, or affiiet the
lord of the fecond,·· Jupiter, Venus, or Part of Fortune, it is an argument
that the querent \Vill not attain riches; or, if he were in a good capacity,
he will be reduced to a very mean t1tuation. The :fignificators of fub-
flanc~ f,vift in motion, and in good parts of the figure, and free from af-
fli4ion, 1hqw the querent will be rich of a fudden; but if they are flo,v
in motiQn, though not ~ffiicted, the qu_
erent \vill attain riches but flo\v]y;
p~rticularly if the planets fignifying riches are ponderous~ and in fixed
I fins. - ·
By tt.t'hat Means jha/1 the ~erent attain Riches?
.
· The ftgnificators of fub!hince, their feveral locations, and the houfes
they govern, are in this queftion to be particularly attended to; for
from thence is kno\Vn by \V hat means riches come. If the lord of the
fecond houfe, or the other fignificators of fubfiance, ·be fortunate1y placed
in the afcendant, the querent will attain great riches without much la-
bour, in a manner unexpectedly; but, if the lord of the fecond be in the
fecond, it !hews the querent v.till obtain a~ eHare by his O\vn indufi!Y.
The adjuvant planets lituated in the afcendant, or the lord thereof, denote
the querent \Viii advance hiznfelf by his O\Vtl indufiry. lf the lord of the
fecond be in the fecond, he acquires wealth by merchandife, and by pro-
perly managing }1is bufinefs; if in the third, or lord of the third, he gnins
l?y brethren kindred, or neighbours. l'he mofi aifured tefiimonies upon
quefiions upon this nature, are thefe : If the lord of-the firil and fecond,
an~ Jupiter, be in conjunction eitlier in the fecond, fidl, tenth, fourth,
feventh, or eleventh, lioufes; or if they apply by fextile or trine to each
<;>ther with n1utual reception; but, if they apply by quartile or oppofirion
with reception, the party will then alfo thrive, and have an efiate, though
~ith ml:lch l'lbour and difficulty. ·

ntithcr be long nor !horr. £\1O\'cablc or cardinal figns haf1cn the .n1nttcr.
In all quefl i~ns that relate to time, the .furc!t \Vay is, to tak~ the right or
oblique afccnfions of the fignific:ators, and dircCl: them to their feveral
protnittors, as in a nativity ; and thus the time of a nlan's obtaining
1ichcs rnay be cxnd ly kno\vn; but if the que!lion be of fn1all confcqucnce,
obicrve the degrees of difiancc, and according fo the figns they are in
n1cafurc out the tin1e in y~ars, · months, \Vecks, or days, as before di-
reCted.
:/ball the §0crent obtain the Goo,is or Money lent ?
.
In this quefiion the lord of the afcendant and the M oon are fignifi-
cators of the quercnt; and the lord of the fecond denotes his fubllance.
But the fevcnth houfe· and his lord reprefcnt the perfon of \Vhom you
enquire ; and the eighth houfe, and the Jord thereof, his fubftancc. Qb-
ferve \Vhethcr the lord of ·the afcendant or· the Moon be joined to the
lord of the eighth, \Vho is ftgnificator of the fubftance · of the party en-
quircJ after; for, if either of them be joined to or .in good afpetl: \vith a _
planet in the eighth houfe, and the planet therein happen to be a fortune,
the querent lhall then obtain the goods or money enquired after. And
if it fhall fo happen, that an infortune be either in the eighth houfe, or
lord of the eighth, and he receive either the lord of the afcendant· or the
Moon, the· perfon ~nquiring !hall obtain 'vhat he ex pects. But not
\Vithout reception. When the lord of the eighth is pofited in the firfl: or
fecond houfe, and the lord of the fecond fhall receive him, it denotes the
perfection of the bufinefs enquired after. But, if the lord of the feventh
or eighth !hall be pofited in t~e fir!l: or 1ccoi1d, and not be received by ei-
ther the lord of the afcendant, the Moon, or.Io.rJ of the fecond, it 1ho\vS
the querent \Vill not only go \Vithout his defire, but, if he purfue the bu-
finefs, he.\vill fuftain n1uch lois and detriment. If the lord of the afcen-
dant or the Moon be joi"ned. to one of the fortuQes, \vhich have. dignity
in the fign afcending, it denotes the difpatch of the bufincfs enquired
after; or if either of them be joined to an infortune, having dignities in
the afccndant, and receive the lord of the afcendant, or the l\'loon, it de-
notes the accompliihment of the matter or bufinefs enquired after. And~
if the fortunes be in po\vcrful places of the figure, and joined to the lord
of the afccndant or the Moon, the n1atter or bufinc1s 'vill be accon1plifhcJ J
.although .there be no,reception.

and in the afccndant, or the Moon be in good afpcet \Vith a fortunate
planet in the third, the querent anrl his brethren and neighbours \ViH
agree \vcll. When the lord of the af{:cndant and lord of the third arc in
fcxtile or trine to each other, and in mutual reception; or the lord of the
third cafis a fcxtilc or trine to the cufp of the a1cendant; and the lord of ,
the afcendant or the n1oon cafis the fame to the cufp of the third hou{e,
it is an argument of great unity, love, and concord, bct\vccn them. \Vhcn
a fortunate planet is in the afccndant, and the lord of the afccndant be-
holds the cufp of the third, or applies friendly to the lqrd of the third, it
is an argun1cnr of good d.ifpofition in the quercnt, and ipeaks him \Villing
to accord 'vith his brethren, J\:indrcd, and neighbours. And if a fortune:
be in the third, and the lord of the third apply in harmony to the lord of
the afcendant, th~ brethren, kindred, or neighbours, are mo!l: indulging.
'fhofc perfons whofc fignificators do n<;>t apply, are moft imperious, and
apt to difi1grec; and thofc \Vhofc fignificators make application, are flexi-
ble, willing, and yielding, and defirous of agreement and concord. When
Saturn, Mars, or the Dragon's Tail, in fuch a quefiion, fhall be in the
afcendant, it denotes the perfon enquiring to be obfiinate, and averfc to
a friendly agreement ; but if they, or either of them, are po!ited in the
third, the brethren, neighpours, and kindred, are of a malicious difpo-
fition ; and . if it happen th~t Saturn or Mars fhall be peregrine, retro-
grade, or combu!t, the malice and mifchief they threaten \vill be the more
michievous. When Saturn or the Dragon,s Head are in the third, the
neighbours arc obftinate, and the kindred covetous and fparing; if 1\'lars,
the kindred are treacherous, and the neighbours difhonell. And this is
certain, \vhen they are out of their eifential dignities. •
Ofthe Cone/ition and Ejiate of an abftnt Brother?.
To refolve this queftion, confider the lord of the third houfe, for that
hath fignification of brethren; and the houfe \Vherc he is pofited, becaufe
that fho\VS the flate and condition of the quefited. For if the lord of the
third be in conjunction, quartile, or oppofition, of th~- infortunes, or in
evil afpect of the lords of the obfcure houfes, the condition of the bro-
ther is forro\vful ; but if, on the contrary, he be in good afpett \vith the
fortunes, and in propitious places of the figure, his condition is good and
profperous. lf_ the lon.l ~f the third be pouted in the fourth, in no evil
nfpcCt ·of the malcv:olents, the brother \vhich is abfcnt hath an intention
to e~rich ~imfelf in the .Place \Vhere he is ; for the fourth houfe is the
... fecond fcom the third. l f the lord of th~ third be pofited in the fiftf1,

a profperoi1s fitu~tion. When the lord of the third is (ound in the eighth,
either in conJuntl:ion, fextil~, or trine, of one of the fortunes, the-abfent
brother is not \veH ;- or if the lord of. the ·third be j-oined to evil planets
in the fixtli hotife, or in conjunCtion with the lord of the fixth, he is
then in an infinn and fickly condition ; and, if the lord of. the fixth be in

feventh, the brbthet is in the fatne country he went into at firft, and con-
tihues there ; and his conditioi1 is nei~her well nor ill. If the fignificator
be in the eighth, the abfent brother is in danger of death, particularly
jf he be combufr, or in conjuqB:ion with the lord of the eighth, in con..
jhnetion or afped: of the infortunes; for thefe nre i1rohg argutn~nts of
death. When the lord of the third is in the ninth, it denotes that the
abfent brother is removed from .the place he firfr went . to, and is gone ,
into a more remote country. And if he be in the tenth, in ·conjunction
dr good afpetl: of the fortunate planets, and \Vith reception, it denotes
him-to have acquired fome honour, office, or prefertnent, in the place_
\vhere he lives. But if he fhall be ih conjunCtion, quartile, or oppofi-
tion, of the infortun~s, combufi, or any other way infortunated, it is to

eleve~th houfe, in conjunction, .fextile~. or tr1nc, of the fortunes, or in
c6njqnd:ioh t:vith the lord of the eleventh, it denotes the abfent brother
to be at the houfe or place of fome friend, where he is· happy and \veil;

pleafed with the 1ituation 'he is in, btit is grieved and perplexed. The

or accidents, upon their journeys, that may occafion them to repent the un-
dertaking of then1. N O\V, for the prevention of fuch accidents, and to en-
able the reader to refolvc quellions of this nature, let the follo\ving rules
be obfervcd. Give the afccndant and his lord, and the i\Ioon, ro the que-
rent; the third houfe and lord thereof to ftgni fy the journey; and if the
fignificators be f\vift in motion, or in the effent ial dignities of each other.
or in conjunction, fcxtile, or trine, to each other.. in good places of the
figure; the journey \Vill be good and profperous. Or if the l\1oon be
in the third, in 1extile to the afccndant, or the lord of the third ca!l: a
fcxtilc or trine to the afcendant, or he in the fan1c; and the lord of the
afcendant \Vell dignified in the third, they alfo denote a fitfc and plea-
f:'lnt journey. If the lord of the afcendant or Moon apply to any planet
in the third houfe, or: the lord of the third to a planet in the afcen-
dant, it like\vife denotes tlle journey enquired after to be pleai£1nt. Or,
if Jupiter or Venus be in the third houfe, it fho\VS a profitable and de-
lightful journey ; particularly if they caft a fextil~ to the afcendant. 1"he
Dragon's Tail in the third houfe, fho\VS the fame. When Saturn, Mars,
or the Dragon's Head, are pouted in the third houfe, or affiiCl: the lord
thereof, or the Moon, it portends an unlucky jour!ley to the quercnt, and
very ill fuccefs therein. Saturn i110\VS the querent to be melancholy and
penfive in his journey; Mars and the .Dragon's Head lho\v him to be in
danger of thieves and robbers; and, if they are in human figns, or fiery,
it denotes him to oe lamed or \VOUnded in his journey. When the lord
of the afcendant is retrograde, the querent \Vill return again before he
hath gone to the place he intended; and, if the fignificators be flo\v, he
tnakes but little hafie or fpeed in his journey. lf the lord of the fixth
affiiet the fignificotors, the querent will fall fick by the \vay ; if the lord
of the tv:elfth, he \vill be in1peded by n1alicious people; and, 'if the lord
of the eighth be the afflicting planet, it 1ho\vs danger of death; particu-
larly if the fignificators are near violent fixed fiars.
Repori.J and Runrours, wht'ther true or fa!fe?
This quefHon may be anf\vered thus: Obfervc the lord of the afcen-
dant and the Moon, and the difpofitor of the Moon, and fcc if either of
thetn be in an angle or fuccedent houfe in a fixed fign, or in good a(pect

the reports and rumo·~1rs nre true. But if the lord of the afcendant or
the lVloon be afflicted of Saturn or Mars. or c(tdent fro1n an angle, al:.
though they be ftrong in the fign where they are, yet th~ rumour is falfe.
Run1ours~are alfo trye and good :when the angles of the figure are in fixed '
ngns, anJ the Moon and Mercury in fixed figns,- feparating frotn the in-
fortunes, and applying to a fortune pofited in any of the angles of the
figure. So alfo '\vhen the angles of the tenth and fourth houfes are fixed,
and the Moon fhall be received ·in either of them, although the ru1nours
and .reports be of an evil nature, yet they \Vill hold true. If the fortu-
nate planets Jupiter and Venus fball be in rbe afcendant, and the Moon
at the fame tirne unfortunate, let the rumours or reports be ever fo mif-
·chiev~us and unlucky, they \Vill be fure.to prove falfe, and come to no-
thing. Mercury being retrograde or other\vite afflicted, declares ill ru..
mours to· be falfe; the like doth the affliction of that planet to whom
Mercury or the Moon applies. If the lord of the afcendant or the Moon
ih«l1 be under the Sun-beams, the truth of the rum_
our is kept fecret by
. men in power, and few !hall know the truth thereof. lf the,Moon be
void of. courfe, or in quartile or oppofition of Mercury, and neither of

.
,.fo rcfolvc this quefiion, givc the afcendant and his lord, and the Moon,
to fignify hin1 that enquires; the fign of the fourth houfc and lord thereof
to fignify the thing qucfitc:d. If the lord of the afccndant or the Moon
be in the fourth houfe, or the lord of the fourth in the firft, or if either
of them -arc in conjunttion \Vith the lord of the fourth, or in fcxtilc or
trine to hin1 \vith reception, it declares the accompli!htnent of the thing
'vithout impedin1ent or hindrance. But if they arc .joined \Vilhout recep-
tion, or in quartile or oppofition \Vith perfeCt reception, the querent may
pofiibly obtain his defire. Or if the- fignificators be not joined together
either by ·body or afpeCl:, yet if there.. be a tranfiation of light between
~hem, either by the Moon or another planet, it 010\VS a poffibility of the
purchafe, though \Vith much difficulty and trouble.
The follo,ving is aifo a good method to judge of this quefiion. Give
the fign afccnding, and the lord thereof, and the planet from \vhom the
~1oon is feparated, to the qucrent or purchafer; the fcventh houfe and .
his lord, the planet or planets pofited therein, and the Mo6n, to .lignify
·the thing to be bought or purchafcd ; and the mid-heaven to lignify the
price thereof. And if _in your figure the lord of the afccndant behold the
lord of the feventh, nnd the lord of the fevcnth apply to the lord of the
afcendant, the feller hath a greater defire to deal \vith the buyer; and if
,they chance to be in each othcr,s digrtities, or any good tranflation of light
happen bct\vcen then1, or if they apply to corporal conjunction, the que-
rent will agree 'vith the feller \Vithouc much difficulty or trouble. But,
if the application or tranflntion of iight be by quartile o"r oppof}tion,
the buyer and fc!lcr \Vill at l~H agree; but it \ViJl .be \Vith much Jubour
and lofs of time, and after n1any probabilities of breaking off. If the
lord of the afcendant or the :\foon apply to the lord of the fourth; or if
lord of the fourth or tbc Moon apply to the lord of the afcend 1nt ;
or if the lord of the fourth alone !hall apply to the ]orJ of the afccn-
dant; and there be a reception het\''ccn thcn1; or if the lord of the nfcen-
dant, or the Moon, be in the fourth, or lord of the fourth in the at~en­
dant; they- denote the party enquiring !hall buy or purchafe the land or
inheritance enquired after. But if neither of. thefe happen, ycr if rhe
Moon fhall transfer the light of one fignificator to the other, it denotes
that
,

that the thing will be perfetted by the mediation of friends, or by 1neiTen-
gers. But if ·there be no application, reception, or tranflation of light,
bet\veen them, then it is in1probable·that any thing !hall be concluded be-
.tween them.

Ofthe ~(1/ity ofthe Put·chaft, a11d u!hether the ff<!Jerent does well to take it?
Take-the fourth houfe to refolve this interrogatory; and if the t\VO
.unfortunate planets are pofited therein, either potent or peregrine, the
thing enquired after will be·\vafled by the buyer; and the prefent is in no -
very good condition. If the'lord of the founh be infortunated, either by -
retrogradation, detriment, fall, or peregrination, it denotes the houie or
land to be bad, . or fo enctnnbered that it will never continue long \vith the
purchafer. But if the fortunate planets, or the Dragon's Tail, be in ~he
fourth houfe, it f11o1vvs the bufinefs enquired after to be good ; and that
the buyer, or purchafer, fhall be a gainer "
thereby. \tVh~n the fortunate
planets cafi their benevolent rays unto the fourth houfe, and the lord of
the fo·urth !hall be pofited jn a good houfe, in fextile or trine to the fecond
houfe or his lord, it is an argument that the bargain is good, and that the
purchafer iliall be a gainer thereby. If Aries, ~co, or Saggittarius, be
t~pon the cufp of the fourth houfe, it denotes an efiate to be hilly, hard,
and dry ; if ""faurus, Virgo, or Capricorn, the land is level and very good;
. if Gemini, Libra, or Aquaries, the ground is forne part high, and fome
low, and i~ in quality neither very good nor very bad; jf Cancer, Scor:.
pio,. or Pifees, it abounds \Vith much \Vater. An unfortunate planet in
the fourth, retrograde, tho\VS the 1andj or houfe ·will tum out very un-
lucky, and not be worth the taking, and will be accompanied \Vith many
infelicities; but, if a fortunate planet be pofited there firong, the land is
good, and n1ay \Vell invite the querent to go on, for he \vill have a good
bargain~

In -this quefiion give the afcendant and the lord thereof, to lignify
the querent; the fev~nth houfe ··and lord thereof, to lignify the place
to \vhich he \Vould go; the fourth houfe and his lord, .the fubftance of
the querent; and the tenth houfe and his lord, the profit of removal.

nfpeCl: \vith fortunaH· ilars, it denotes t~c tunc. Unfortunate planets
in the afccnd:tnt or fourth, fho\v the qucrcnt it is good to remove ;
and, if the lords of the afcetidant and fourth be afllictcd by rhc mJ...
Iefics, either by body or afpcd, it denotes the fan)e. Obfcrvc the
affii~ling planet or planets, and the houfc or houfcs they go''crn, for. from
thence the occafion of the n1ifchicf that the qucrcnt fu!tains is knO\\'D;
the like obicrve of the .aflifiing or friendly planet's, \\'hence a rJtional an-
f\vcr to the q uefiion propof~d \\'ill be eafily obtained.
Of Treajures lJid, r;J,hcther atttzinable or not.
It is not uncommon for penurious perfons to hide trc,,furc in their
life-tin1e, and to go out of the \Vorld \Vithout informing their heirs or
executors \vhere to find it. Whenever this is fufpccted to be the cafe,
nnd a quefHon is grounded upon it, erect your figure, and confider \\'hat
npplication, reception, tranflation, &c. there tnay be bet\vceo the lords
of the afcendant and fourth houfe. If there be a friendly application
and reception, the perfon enquiring {hall obtain the treafure he enquires
after ; but if there be a quartile or oppofition bet\vecn the fignificators,
\vithout the reception, the treafure will rarely be fouud4 \V hen ~
the fignificators apply to each other corporally in a fixc::d fign, there are
great hopes of finding and obtaining the L'lme fpeedily; particularly if
the application be in a good houfe. Both or either of the ltuninaries in
the afcenclant no \vay unfortunate, or friendly beholding the fiunc, argues
a fpcedy recovery of the treafure hid ; but if they ihould happen to be
cadent, or in quartile or oppofition thereto, it gives but iinall hopes.
lf the part of fortune be in the afccndant,'beheld oy fortunate planets,
or by the luminaries, the quercnt \viii h1ve a fair profpeCl: of acquiring
his tvif11es ; but if the p~rt of fortune and the lumin3ries be cadent, par-
ticularly the Moon; and neither of th~ lights caO: a friendly afpetl: to the
part of fortune, or to the afcendant ; nor the lord of the nfcendnnt be-
holding the afcendant; it is an argtnnent th:H the quercnt \viii not obtain
the trcafure hid. I ahvays find, in quefl:ions of this nature, that, if
fortunate planets arc in the fourth, or govern the fourth, there is trea-
fure; and, if the lord of the afcendfant or the 1\lloon be in good afpeCl:
\Vith thofe plane.ts, the querent generally attains it by diligent fcarch.
But, on the contrary, if infortunes be in the fourth houfe, .or the Iun1i-
narie~ \Veak. therein, it is an argun1ent of irrecovcry ; or iho\VS that it
bas been taken a\Yay before.

A qucfiion being thus in a general ·way propounded, give the lord of
the afc~ndant and the Moon to".the querent for_ his fignificators; and the
fourth ho_ufe, and tlie pla.net or planets pofited therein, \Vill fignify
the treafure enquired after. When Jupiter, Venus, or the Dragon,s
Head, are in the ,tourth houfe, they declare the treafure to be in· the ·
place fuppofed ; and, if they· be in their effential digpities, it is very
certain that there is great value there. Or if any of the othe'r planets
are pofite~ in their own houfes, or in the fourth houfe \Vithout i~npedi­
tnent; it fho\VS that there is treafure in the place fuppofed. But jf the
fourth houfe be infortunated \vith the Dragon's ·Tail, or Safurn or. Mars
b,e there, and no \vay effentially dignified ; or if- Saturn or Mars. cafi a
quartile or .oppofition thereunto, there is no treafure at all. The lord

has been treafure hid in the place fu ppoied, but that it is gone•
.
.,hall the ' ff(ytrent enjoy the Ejlate ofhiJ· Father.~
This quefiion is oftentimes of great importance to the proponent, and
~herefore ought to be contemplated ·\Vlth t11ore than ufual acutenefs. If
in the figure, judicioufly erected, and correCt to time, the lord of the
fecond, and )ord of the fifth, are found in the mutual dignities of. each~
other; or the lord of· the fecond in the fifth, or the lord of the fifth in
the fc.cond; the querent \vill enjoy ~he efiate of his father. But if the
lord of the fifth houfe be retrograde, or affiided by foroe malevolent .pla-
net, it preiages that n1uch of the eilate \vhich the qucrent's f~lther intend-
ed for him vvill be \vaftcd or other,viie difpofed of. When' the lord
of the fifth difpofes of the part of fortune in the afcendant, or fecond
houfe of the figure, there is no fear but the quere~1t w'iJl enjoy \Vhat he
expeCl:s from his father. The lord of the. afcendant, or fecond houfe,.
difpofing of the lord of the fifth, !bows the thing enquired after .to be fo
fecured to the querent, that he cannot be deprived of it. ..I'he Moon tranf-
ferring t~e light of the lord of the fifth, by fextilc or trint;, to the lord of
the fecon.d, or lord of the afcendant, declares the quefiion enquired after
!hall come to good ; or if Jnpiter or·Venus in the fifth fhall friendly
behold the lord of the fecond, or a planet in the fecon\1, it fignifies ~he
:fitme. If the lord of the fecond and fifth apply to a good afpeCt, or a cor-
poral conjunction by retrogradation, the querent will receive fome' of·
his father\ eftate very fhorrly , and in his father's life-time; but i( the
lord of the fourth be in afpeet wirh an infortune, or an infortune in.. the

'vhether any other planets transfer the light of the lord of the afccndant
to the lord of the fifth,· for that ~s an argurr1ent that the queren~ tnay
have children. Confider alfo whether the fign upon the fifth be fruitful,
and \Nh,ether the lord of the fifth, the Moon, the afcendant, and its
lord, are in prolific figns; for; if fo, it is an affurcd argument that the
querent \vill hav~ i!fue. If the lord of the afcerldant, or the Moon, be
pofited in the fifth houfe, the querent \vili have children; or, if the lord
of the fifth houfe be in the afcendant, it declares the fame. If ntither
the lord of the afcendant nor the Moon apply to the lord of the fifth,
yet if there be a tranflarion of light and virtue bet\veen them, the que..
rent need not doubt of having children. But if all the fignificators be
in fierile figns, and in defetl.ive degrees of thofe figns, the ·querent \vill
rarely have iiTue. So alfo, if Venus, the general fignificator of children
or iffue, be afflicted, either by the prefcnce of Saturn, Mars, or the
Dragon,s Tail, or cotnbuO: of the Sun, the querent \vill not have chil-
dren. Saturn or the Dragon's Tail in the fifth, or afflicting the· lord of
the fifth, generally denies iffue; ·and, if Saturn or Mars be in quartile or
oppofition to the fifth houfe, or its lord, it portends the fame. La'fily,
confider the planets Jupiter and Venus; and if you flnd either of them
in the fifth, third, firft, ninth, or eleventh, houfes, free from all impe-
diment, the qucrent \vill certainly have children. · ·

JOQ AN ILLUS'rH.ATION
In what TinJt jhtJllthe lfroJJltl!I concei·ve ?
Having before found a poffibility of iffue, it may be aiked \Vhen the
tin1e {hall be f to anfwer \Vhich, obferve in \Vhat fign the Jord of the
fifth houfe is pofited, and what planet or planets are in configuration
\vith him; for,' if he be in the.. afcendant, fifth or eleventh houfes, in
fruitful .figns, and t-vith fruitful.. planet~, the querent may fpeedily con-
ceive. If the lord of the :fifth be in the firft houfe, t·he querent may
conceive in the firft year; if in the fecond, the fecond year; if in the
tenth, the third year ;· if in the feventh, the fourth year; if in the
fourth houfe, the fifth year; and fo on. Or, having noted the capacity
and condition of the querent for conception, obfc::rve the difiance be-
tween the frfendly afpecl:s of the Moon, or lord of the afcendant. \Vith
the lord of the fiftb, and Jupiter or Venus, and judge of the time thus:
If they are in moveable figns, their degrees ~f difiance f110\V \veeks or
days ; in common figns, tnonths, or weeks; in fixed figns, years, or
~nonths, &c. ~s before direetcd in quefiions that relate titnc.

If a Won;an enquiring be with Child.~
It fometitnes happ~ns that a \Voman has_ reafon to. believe lhe is with
child: and yet, o\ving to fon1e internal complaint, may be in doubt
about it, and, by that means be led to afk the quefiion, \Vhether !he. be
or not t The queftio~ is found by thefe rules : If the lord of the afcend-
ant, or the Moon, behold the lord of the fifth \vith any good afpect or
tranflation; or they, or either of then1, happen to be pofited in the fi(th
houfe j the woman enquiring is \Vith child. And when the fignifica-
tors apply friendly, or are pofited in fruitful figns, and in frui.tful houfes
al[o, ?S the fifth, eleventh, and feventh, the party enquiring is \vith
child. The lord of the afcendant, or lord of the fifth, aipccting a pla-
net \vith rccepti9n in an angle, and the l\f0on in reception \V ith a planet
eflentially fortified in an angle, alfo iho\VS the qu~rent to be pregnant.
Jupiter, the natural fignificator of children, in the afcendant, fifth~ fe-
venth, or eleventh, houfes, no \vay affliCted of the infortunes, denotes the
querent to be \vith chiltl. But if Jupiter be affiicted, or cadent, the \.YO-
man enquiring is not "Tith child. If the lord of the .tenth, and th~ Sun,
be in good places of the figure, and in friendly configuration t-vith the
benefic~, the \voman enquiring is with chiJld. Like\vile, if the Moon,
and the lord of the t-riplicity fhe is in, be \Yell located in figns of n1any
children, as Cancer, .Scorpio, or Pifces the \Votnan has conceived.
So alfo, if Jupiter and Venus be pofited in angles free from the ma-
licious bean1s of the infortunes, the woman is certainly \vid~ child~ But
if the 11gnificators are afflicted of Saturn·, Mars, or the Dragon's ~rail,

1"'o anfvJcr th1s <]Ul"flion, .obferve the afccndant, and its lord, the fifth·
houfe and the lord thereof, together ~vitlt the . oon, and planet to \\'hich
fhe applies; for, if they, or rnufl of then1, be in the mafcuiine figns, the
querent is 'vith child of a boy; but, if in feminine figns, it is a girL
"fhe faid fignificators, though in fe1ninine fignc;, yet if they are in a{pea
\v·ith 1nafculine planets, and in houres mafculine, and \vith Hars of a
n1afculine nature and di li)ofition, the 'von1an \vill have a n1ale ch;Jd.
l\~1afculine planets are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and the Sun; the fe1ninine
are Venus and the Moon; Mflrcury is in its nature convertible, and is
either mafculine or ·fetninine according to the planet. or planets he is in
afpeEl '~ith. Signs of a mafculine difjJofition, or nature, are Aries, Ge-

Confider the fign upon the afcendant, and ,vherc the lord thereof is
pofitcd, and what fign is upon the cufp of the ·fifth houfe; for, if the
lignificators ar~ in bicorpor,1l. or double-bodied figns, the querent "'ill
very probably have t'vo chtldren. If Jupirer, Venus, or the Dragon's
Head, be in a fruitful fign, either in the fifth or a(cendant, it i~ polliblc
for the querent to have .three children; particularly if the Iv1oon l~nds
her affiHance. But, if thefe planets arc ~1ot poflted in the afcendant, or
fifth houfe ; yet, if they can their friendly rays to either of them, it is
an argtunent that the querent ''lill have t\vins. But, if fixed figns, or
moveable, poJlefs ti1e cufps of the afcendant or fifth houfe, ~nd the Sun
or Moon be pofited therein, it is certain argument that the \VOJnan is
breeding ''rith but one child. ·

To refolve this quellion, regard 1nufl be had to the fignificators as 'veU

then judge ~he 1neHen~er hath effected his bufinefs, and is retarntng again.
And, if he feparates from the lord of the fecond, he then brings n1oney
\vith hi'rn, let the fignificator of that hou{e be either a fortune or infor-
tune. If the fignificator of the tueHenger feparates from fortunate planets,
it is an argun1ent he has been honeH, and 'vill bring good tidings of the
bullnefs ; but, if he feparates fron1 the n1alevolents, jt fhe,vs the n1cf·
ienger has done his buflnels latnely, or has been hindered i.n the per-
fornlance of it. If the fignificator of the tne!Tenger applies to an infor-
tune by qun.rtile..or oppofition, and this before he can feparate from the
lord of the feventh, _it fignifies that the 1neffenger has 111et v.-ith fo1ne
impeditnent in the bufinefS he went about fron1 the party to whom he
was fent. But, if the fignificator ..of the 1neffenger fuall go, to the q~ar­

the lord of the feventh; the tneffenger \vill recei\'e forne prejudice or
irnpr-diment in his way' home. If there be found an .infortune in the
ninth, the n1elfenger vvill not travel fafe, but will be in danger of high--
way robbery, and bodily hurt; but if., on the contrary, a benefic be in
the ninth, he \Vlll travel fafe. If the lord of the afcendant and lord of
the fift.h are in reception, orin good afpeEl fron1 good places of the figure,

then judge as f()llow·s: The horofcope affiiCled by the prefence of an cvi~

per lies chie~y in the head, and in that n1en1ber or part of Lhe bodv re-

Mars and Venus be in the afcendant, or fixth houfe, the difeafe lies in the

To kno~v this, confider the complexion of the perfon, his age, and the·-
titne of the year; for the knowledge of thefe conduce much to the dit:-
co~very of the certainty of the rr1atter propounded-
. Difeafes in aututnn
and \vinter are urually reputed chronical or long; but longer in winter
than in auturnn. l.n fpring and funnner acute or fhort; but more acute·
in fpring ~than in fumn1er. So infinnities affliaing young . perfons, ~ or
thole in the firH half of their age, are fhorter and ~efs dangerous than
th?fe in elderly perfons, or thofe· that are in the JaH part of their age.
Like\vife, rnelancholy and phlegrnatic perfons are fubject to. chronical dif...
ttafes; but fanguine and choleric perfons to acute. Saturnine difeafes,..
'vhich are cold a'nd dry, are u(ually long and tedious; the Moon and_
Venus are protraB:ers of the infirmity; Jupiter> 1\tlars, the. Sun., and
.Nlercury, fignify difeafes of no long continuance, but fuch as may re-
turn fpeedily ; bt.lt, by being lords of evil places, or otherwife affitB:ed;
they may have lignification of chronic difeafes. 'The figns poffeffing the
alcendant, {ixth houfe., or place of the Moon, being fixed) declare a
chronic difea!e·; com1non figns !hew difeafes. neither very long nor very
fhort; moveable·figns denote the difeafe to terminate q_uicldy, either
one 'vay or the othe.\. An infortutie being-· lord of the fixth, and in the
fixth, prefages a· laft1ng ficknefs ; but, if a benefic be lord of the fixth,
and in the fixth, the difeafe will adtnit of an-immediate cure. 1"'he lord of
~he a,fcendant, the Nloon, or lord of the fixth~ in conjuntlion, fexti1e, or
trine, of the lord·of the tenth, denotes the difeafe·to be of no long con-:- _
tinuance; and if they be in conjunaion, fextile, or trine, ,of the fortunes,.
the f~une. But if the faid fignificators, or any. of thetn, be in conjunc-
tion, quartile, or oppofition, of the infortunes, the difeafe will be both
long and tedious; and, if this fhall happen in fixed figns, it argues the
duration or continuance to be frill the longer.

When this queflion is put by the mailer, give the lord ofthe afcendant

lord to fignify the fervant. And, if the lord of the fixth commit his

will prove jufi and honefi. If the ¥oon tr~nsfer the lig!1t of the lord of

if the J·ord of the fixth fhall be in conjunElion of the infortunes, and in

The fignificators of nl~rriage in conjuntlion, rextile, or trine, wiLh lllany
pl~nets, port~nd man·~age to the querent tnore than once; particulat!ly
from the .1fth, ieyenth, or eleventh, houfes. Many planets in the feventh
houf~, in fextile or trine to the luminaries or lord of the afcendant, denote
the querent \\'ill be married more than once. But, if the 11gnificators of
tnarriage are in fixed figns, and in afpetl with not above one planet, it
prefagcs that the querent will n1arry only once.

Obferve what planet the lord of the afcendant, or l\1oon, is neare!l in

or wotnan, accordingly; for fuch a one the querent \"-~ill marry. If the
lord of the afcendant or Moon be in conjunclion or afpeEl '"ith Venus,
the perfon .is pleafant and affable;. if with- the Sun, he is noble, of a
great fpirit, and imperious; if with M.ars, the perfon is many times rafh
and furious, and fubjeEt to choler and paffion; if with Saturn, he is in.
clinable to·melancholy, but prudent and grave; if "vith Jupiter, the
perfon is jufi, honefi, and religious; if with Venus, fubtil! cunning,

The lord of the afcendant, or Moon, in conjunaion, fextilef or trine,

If there happens to be a reception, though they are in quartile, it in1·

Shall the Marriage be ejfeEled, or broken off?
The perfon, who enquires concerning the concluding or breaking ofr
an intended tnarriage, muH have the lord of the afcendant and n1oon for
fignificators ; and the perfon quefited muH have the lord of the feventh
and the planet from which the Moon is feRaratcd. If the lord of the af-
cendant or Moon be joined to the lord of the feventh, or in fextile or
trine to hirn, in any ot his elfential dignities, the marriage intended ,..·ill
be brought to perfeEtion, particularly if it be from good houfes of the
figure. If a quartile or oppofition happens betvveen the fignificators*
and no reception, the intended marriage \¥ill be broken off, and come to
nothing. \Vhen there is no afpea bet\veen the fignificators, yet, if there
be any good tranllation of light between them, and this by a benevolent
planet, the marriage may be effetled by a perfon reprefented by the houfe
that planet is lord or governor of. So alfo, if the fignificator of bo~h
parties apply to a friendly afpeB:, and, before the afpea be made, an in-
fortune interpofes his nutlicious rays, the marriage \Viii be obllruaed by
a perfon fignified by the houfe the interpofing planet is lord of. If the
interpofing planet be lord of the third, a kinfrnan of the querent's, or a

The lord of the. afcendant and feventh, being friends according to na-

ners fhall agree·in their partnerfhip, and gain confiderably by their un..

agree, but will be perpetually jangling, and injuring each other. Ifthe
lord of the afcendant be a n1ore \\.,eighty planet than the lord of the
feventh, and better dignified, it {hews the querent will thrive beft in the
partnerfhip; but, if the lord of the feventh be mofl ponderous, the
quefited gains mofi. Mars or Mercury lord of the fecond, affliaing the
lord of the eighth, fhews the querent 'vill cheat his partner; but, if
either of them be lord of the eighth, and affiia the lord of the fecond,
the partner 'viii cheat the querent. He,-whofe fignificators are firongeft

I
If the lord .of the afcendant be more potent than the ford of the fe...
venth, or the afcendant better fortified than the feventh houfe, either by
the good afpe&s or the prefence of the fortunate planets, there is great
probability the querent will be fuccefsful in the fuit at la\v, and overcome
his adverfary. )3ut, if the lord of the feventh be more powerful in digni-
ties than the lord of the afcendant, and the feventh houfe better guarded
by the prefence or rays of the fortunate Hars than the afcendant, the ad-
verfary will overcome. If the lords of the afcendant and fevent~ be af-
fliaed by the infortunes, neither party '~ill fucceed, but both will be
injured, if they go on with the fuit. If they fhould both be affiH.ed by
the fortunate p!anets, poffibly-fome friend will make up the breach be-
tween them. Both fignificators in their effential dignities, and in angles,
fhew both perfons to be too high to hearken to a reconciliation. If they
apply friendly to each oth~r, the matter will be ~aken up among them-.
felves ; and he, whofe figrnficator ·doth apply, will be the firH: to make
overtures of friet:dlliip and peace. .
Shall a Peifon returnfafi .from a ~Cruize or Cac1paign?
The lord of the afcendant ~rong and potent, free from the evil beams

hou ie the befieged ; the lord of the fourth, the governor; the fifth and
its lord, the ammunition, foldiery, and the affiltancc they either haye
or may expcEl:. If the lord of the a!cendant be flrong and fortunate,
and joined to the lord of the fourth in the afccndant, or \Vith the Moon
or lord of the tenth houfc, in reception; it is an argument that the
befiegers fhaJl prove viCtorious. Or, if the lord of the fourth be in
houfes not beholding the fourth, ·or in1peded of the infortunes, it is
~n ~rgument that the garr1fon \Viii be taken, and the governor ,there?£
fubjett to danger.. If the unfortunate planets, or the Dragons Tad,
happen to be in the fourth houfe, and the fortunate planets intcrpofc
not their benevolent rays, it wilJ be taken by treachery and bafenefs in a

Ieventh do not apply, the querent tnay find him by enquiry. But if the
fignificators behold each other by quartile or oppofition, or from no a(:

of recovery. The lord of the feventh, either in the twelfth houfe of the

nativity of a perfon is not to be had; for no abiolute confidence can be

or the Dragon's 1-lcad, pofited in the eighth houfe, or on the cufp of the
eighth, in the tenns of the fortunes, the lord of the eighth being no ,,~ay
in1pedcd, argues the querent £hall have his 'vife's portion \Vithout any
Jnanner of troub1e. The part of fortune in. the c1ghth houfe, in the
dignities of Jupiter or \'enus, and they calling their fcxtile or trine af-
peas thither, argues not only that the quercnt 01all have the dowry of
his ,,,ifc, but aBo fhe\vs it to be confiderable. If there happens a friendly

cators, and no reception or tranflation of1ight; or if the lord of the eighth

Shall the Voyage bt projperous or not?
'¥hen the ninth hou(e or its~ lord fhall be unfortunately afpetied, it
denotes many hazards and dangers to attend the voyage. If Saturn be
the affliaing planet, the perfon enquiring will be fubjea to fickne(s
and lofs of goods ; but, if Mars ·or the Dragon's 1..ail affiiB: either the
ninth houfe or its lord., they declare danger by enemies or pirates. If
the ninth houfe or its lord be fortunate and Hrong, much good and
great f~cce{s are promifed to the qucrent in the voyage, and that he !hall
make a happy and fafe return. , The lord of the afcendant and lord of
the ninth in conjunB:ion, fextile, or ~rine, with each other, particU,lady ·
if there be any reception between them, or pofition in each other's.
hou(~s, argues an admirable voyage, ~nd a propitious _and fafe return;.

The fignificators of the pcrfon cnquif,ing. and of the voyage, fwift in
n1otion, oriental, and in movcnbJe figns, denote the voyage to be thort
and quick; but, if occidental, they lhc'v fomc ob!lructions. \~hen
the lord of the aft'endant appl ics to the lord of the ninth, or the lord or
the ninth to the lord of i~e afccndant; or jf a fortunate planet transfers
the light of Lhc one to that of the other; they ''rc good arguments of a
Jafc return, and a fhort and fpeedy voyage. 'fhe lord of the ninth in a
fixed fign, and the lord ofthe afcendant and Moon in fixed figns, denote
a very long \'oyage to the querent; if in common figns, the voyage \viii
be indiHercnt1y good; if in moveable figns, he returns fpeedily. If the
lord or' the afcendant be retrograde, or it either he or the ~1oon apply to
a planet that is retrograde, it lignifies the perfon that goes the voyage·
'vill return horne in a fhort time, or perhaps before he goes to the place·
intended. ·
May the Querent profit by the Science intended.P
Give the afcendant, its lord, and the Moon, to fignify the querent;·
the ninth houfe, the lord thereof, and the planet pofited therein, to fig-
nify the fcience enquired after; and, according to their pofitions and.
configurations, judge of the queflion. The lord of the afcendant and
lord of the ninth in conjunClion, or in fextile or trine unto each other
either in or from angles. or fuccedent houfes, give great hopes to th~
qucrent th~t he Ihall gatn or profit by the art or fc1ence he tntends to
follow. If fortunate planets poffefs the alcendant or ninth houfe, and
thence Ihall friendly behold either the cufps of each J1oufe or the lords of

intended. If the Moon be pofited in the ninth, in fextile to the lord.

Shall a Clergytnan obtain the Benefice he enquires after.~
Give the afcendant and it~ lord, and the Moon, to fignify the clergy..
man; and let the ninth houfe fignify the living, or other ecclefiafhcal
preferment fought after. The lord of the afcendant or Moon, joined to
th~ !ord of the ninth by body or good afpeEt., gives great hopes that the
m1nlfler or querent may ~bta1n the benefice defired. If the Moon or
lord of the afcendant be in the ninth, or lord of the ninth in the afcen...
dant, or in reception 'vith each other, they arc very good arguments
that the querent or 1ninifler fhal] obtain the parfonage or church-prefer-
ment defired. vVhen the lord of the afcendant, or Moon, are joined to
the Sun or Jupiter; or in fextile or trine of either of them, in the af-
cendant or.ninth houfe ; it denotes that the querent 'viii obtain the be-
nefice ~nquired after. If the principal fignificators be in fextile or trine
with reception, the prefennent or benefice comes \vith little trouble; if
they be in quartile, arid at the farne titne in ~eception, the benefice may
be obtained, but it will be with great trouble and delay. The bufinels
may. alfo be brought to pafs by tranilation of light; for, if a p·lanet [epa-
rates itnmediately fro1n the good afpeEl: of the lord of the ninth, and ap-
plies to the lord of the ·afcendant; or if he feparates from the Jord of the
afcendant, and applies to the lord of the ninth ; the benefice or prefer..
ment ·will be obtained, and by the means. of a perlon fignificd by the
planet that .thus transfers the light 'of the fignificators to each other.-
But, if none of thefe teHimonies happen, it will qc a very difficu]t nlat-
ter to obtain the benefice defired. 1 he lord of the afrendant retrograde,
combufl:, or cadent, and he or the Moon in quartile or oppofition of the
infortnnes) or of the lord of the ninth houfe, 'vithout recepLion, declares
the de!lruElion of the 1natter enquired after, and {he\YS that it fnall come
to nothing. Infortunes in the riinth houfe, or in the afcendant, or afTlicl-
ing the lord of.the afcendant or ninth houfe, or the ~loon, fhe'v n1uch
trouble and vexation to the perfon enquiring after the benefice, and an iln..
poHibility of obtaining the bufinefs at ]aft. Obferve that planet \\1
hich
cafis. a quartile or oppofition either to the lord of the afcendant or Moont
and take notice of the houfe he is lord of; for by that means mav be dif-
covered 'vhat or who will be the occafion of preventing the bufinefs from
taking place. The afflicting planet, being lord of the third, denotes a
neighbour to be the' impeditor of the th~ng; if of the eleventh, fome
pretended friend; jf of the tenth, the patron hath no good opinion of
him ; if of the feventh or fifth, he is confidered a contentious and iin--
proper perfon. Fortunate planets in fortunate places of the figure, be-
friending the fignificators~ give hopes of the bufi nels enquired after; but
if malefic planets, in unfortunate places of the figure, afBia the fignifi..

obtain the honour or office he feeks after. The fignificators in fextile

tunate planets in the tenth, or in conjuntlion, fextile, or trine, of the
lord of the tenth, having dignities in the afcendant, declare the querent
will obtain the office or digntty defired. If Saturn or Mars be firong in

afpea, it prefages hopes of the prefern1ent fought after, and that it
'vill be gained, although with much trouble. A fortunate planet tranf.

denotes the querent will obtain the dignity or honour fought after, by
the means of the perfon reprefented by that planet 'vho thus transfers the
light of the lord of the tenth. If the Sun's light be fo transferre~, it
portends the fan1e. But, if none of the aforefaid configurations re-

be a luperior planet, as Saturn, Jupiter, or Mars, and any way dignified,
the enemies are the more to be feared; but, if they are inferiors, they are
not Io dangerous; the more po\verful the fignificators of the enen1ies are,
the more injury will the querent fufl:ain by them; the lcfs povverful, the
lefs evil and m1fchief will they be able to do him. If the lord ofany other
houfe befides the twelfth be in quartile or oppofition to the lord of the
afcendant or the Moon; or.to the a{cendant itfelf, from obfcure places of
the figure, the querent hath private enemies. But if the afcendant, and
the lord thereof, and the ~1oon, be void of the evil afpeRs of any planet
or planets, and are befriended by the good rays of the fortunes, and the
lord ofthe afcendant and the Moon in fortunate places of the figure, they
denote the querent hath no private enemies.
T;Vho are his prr:vate Enen1ies, and how 1JJny he kno"!' tbe111?
To refolve this quellion truly, obferve the pofitions of the lords of the
afcendant and t\velfth houfe; for, if the lord of the tw·elfth affiiEl the
lord of the a!cendant, or the afcendant froln the third houfe, the lord of
the third affifting, the quercnt's greateft private ene1nies are thofe that live
near hin1, or are nearly related to him ; that is to fay, either a brother,
kinftnan, or neighbour. The pcrfon is to be defcribed by the planet af-
Uiaincr, and the fign in which he is pofited. If the lord of the t\\i~lfth
afflia~he a{cendant or his lord from the fourth houfe, the father of the
querent is his enemy; if in the fifth, his children or forne occa~onal

vifitor \\rill prove his private enemy. If in the fixth houfe, his fervant~,
or an uncle. If in the feventh houfe, his wife or partner fhall prove {e-
cretly rnifchievous to hin1. The perfon or perfons fignified by that houfe
\Vhere the Dragon's Tail is pofited will be malicious and prejudicial to
the querent ; particularly if the lord thereof affiia the lord of the afcen-
dant., the afcendant itfelf~ or the IVIoon, at the fan1e tirne.
Of..a Prifoner or Captive, when jha/1 ht hejet at Libert;'?
,
The lord of the afcendant or Moon, fwift in n1otion, denotes freedo1u.
from i1nprifonment in a fhort time; ifeither of them cotnmit their vir-~
tues or difpofitions to any planet or planets in the third or ninth houfe, or
to the lords of them, not being pofited in at1gles, it argues a releafe from
imprifonment in a {hort time. If the lord of the afcendant or the Moon
be more potent in the figure than the lord of the twelfth, or be feparating
from the ill a{peas of the lord oT the twelfth, or the difpofitor of the part
of in~prifonment, particularly in 1noveable figns, and thence im1nediately
applying to the friendly beams of the fortunate planets Jupiter or Venus;
the prifoner or captive cannot remain long in the prifon where he is, but
will be releafed. 'fhe lord of the afcenddnt or the Moon in the fourth,
fixth, eighth, or t\velfth, .houfes~ or under the Sun-beams, or retro..
grade, or unhappily affiiacd of Saturn or Mars, fhe,vs the perfon un-·
der refiraint \vill not be releafed from confinement for a long tirne. And, if
the infortune happens to be lord of the eighth, he will d1e in prifon. If
the lord of the afcendant or the Moon feparate from the lord of the
fourth, and immediately apply to lupiter or Venus ; or if the lord of the
fourth feparate from the lord of the afcendant ; they argue good hopes
that the captive or prifoner £hall not continue·long in prifon. A fixed
fign afcendtng at the time of the quefiion, and the lord thereof a ponder-
ous planet, and in an angle, portends a tedious time of imprifonment.
If common figns, the affiiElion \viii not be fo long; if moveable, it
will be very ibort ;. if the lord of the afcendant be cadent from his
houfe or exaltation, and the Moon happen ~o be in Scorpio or Aqua-
rius, it pre!ages long imprifonment. If the lord of the hour in which
the prifoner was taken be an unfortunate planet, and unfortunately
placed in. t~1e heaven.s, it declares a tedious _imp~ifonment, and very
long captivtty ; but, tf he be a fortune, the tmprtfonment cannot be
long~ 'fhe only way to difcover the length of time in which a priioner
or eaptive fhall be releafed, is, by obferving the degrees of difiance
between the fignificators and the fortunate planets, or the Sun .; and ac-
cording to the Jigns they !hall be found in, whether fixed, common, or
moveable, meafure the days, weeks, months, or years, of the prifoner's

1\11y firft bufinefs \\·as to examine the figure, to find \vhether it w·ere
radical, and fit to be adjudged, which 1 found to be the cafe, becaufe
the lord of the a{cendant and the lord of the hour are of one nature and
triplicitv; and the fignificator of the querent exaclly defcribed his perfon,
which is of a middle Hature, fanguine complexion, and of an acute un..
derHanding, denoted by Mercury's pofition iu the fign Aries, the houfe
of l\1ars. The Moon being in oppofition to the· fun, fhe\\~'S him to have
a tnark or fear near the left eye ; vv~hich 'vas alfo.true ; and therefore, as
I found all circutn!lances to concur in proving the quefi.ion to be \veil
and ferioufly grounded, and free from aU itnpofition, I gave hitn mv
judgn1ent upon the figure as follows. ~
The princely fign Leo, the querent's fignificator, occupies the afcen-
dant; and the Sun, the lord thereof, and giver of life, is pofited near
his meridian altitude in the medium creli, and in the fign Aries, his
houfe of exaltation, firong, ·powerful, and in full dignity; free from the
evil rays of the lord of the fixth, 'eighth, fourth, or fecond, houfes,
which neither impedite the Sun nor the afcendant with any evil afpea.
But the Moon, Jady of the twelfth, is in oppofition to the Sun, making
at the fame tin1e a quartile mundane afpeCl with the afcendant, and a fex-
tile afpea with Saturn in the zodiac; fro1n which pofitions I inferred the
following particulars.
The affiiaion of the lord of the afcendant, by oppo!ition of the
Moon in Libra, the houfe of Venus, and Venus difpofitor of the Moon
in her o'vn houfe, and in the feminine fign Taurus, going to a femifex-
tile with the Sun, denotes that ne will receive fome contiderable injury
from a female conneClion, no·w· exifting under the fpecious pretence of
friendChip and fond attachment; an~ tliis is de~lared by the. Moon being
lady of the t\velfth, the houfe of pnvate enemies, whtch dtfpofes of the
part of fortune, and thereby indicates that he \vill loie fome part of his ·
fortune by her means~
The Moon's mundane quartile afpeEl. to the afcendant, in an airy fign,
declares that he will be attacl~ed \Vith a fevere fit of the wind cholic, or
fome dangerous complaint in the bowels and reins; but it will not prove
fatal to hin1, becaufe the Sun, the lord of his afcendant, is more Hrong
and powerfu], and in greater dignities, than the affiiB:ing planets; and
therefore, according to natural efficient caufes, they will prevail over all
fubordinate effeEls. r •

From n confideration of thofe parts of the figure which relate Lo the
circumUances of his ran life, I informed him he had i1nproved his for-
tunc, and been fuccc[~ful in fome important voyage, becaufc the Dra-
gon's Head is fituatcd in his ninth houfc ; but that he had lately fuffcred
greatly by a violent hurricane, that threatened dcHruaion or fhipwrcck ;
\vhich is denoted by the oppofition of Saturn to the part of fortune, and
the ~Ioon having lately feparated from an oppofition '''ith Niercury, lord
of the third houie, 'vherc the Dragon's Ta1l is pofited. This circurn-
fiance I had the pleafure of hearing him acknowledge to be true ; and
that the fiorm arofc only eight days before the {hip came into port.
He requefied tne to afcertain the time '\~:hen the above- illnefs \\,.ould
happen. I accordingly took the number of degrees bct,.,·cen the Sun and
Ivloon, by fubtraa1ng the lefs fum from the greater; and found the
diflance to be eleven degrees fifty-nine minutes. I then fought the
lVIoon's lantude, and found it one degree thirty-three minutes fouth,
'vhich, added to the above, make thirteen Qegrees thirty-t\VO rninutes ;
and, as the {ignificators ar~ in moveable figns, I con1puted the ti1ne by
'veeks and days, and predicted this illnefs 'vould befall him about the
20th of July following; and that, after he lliould be refiored to health
again he \\"ould go on, 'vithout fufiaining any other ferious indifpofition,
until the fixty-ninth year of his age ; aoout 'vhich titne I conceive the
funaions of life will be naturally extinguifi1ed, by a complication of jn..
finnities.
I have lately had the pleafure of converfing with the gentleman on tl1e
fubjett of this quefiion. He informed me, that to\vards the middle of
July, 1783, he was attacked by a kind of bilious complaint in his
ltomach, which brought on violent fits of the cholic. 1"hat, towards
the latter end of the fame month, he found an obfiru&ion in his bo\rels,
and his phyfician declared it next to a 1niraclc that his life 'vas faved.
lie no\v appears to be in perfea health, and has 1unk a coniiderable fum
of money in life annuities, which he declares 'vas done in confequence of
the verity he found in thefe prediEl:ions.

Here the afcendant and the Moon are fignificators of the fhip; and
Venus, becaufe the fign Taurus, the houfe of Venus, is on the afcenda nt,
is fignificatrix of the crew ; and Mercury, with the part of fortune, de-
note her fiores and all·t.he other·materials on board·her. The lliip itfelf

flrated by an earthy fig~ poffeffing the cufp of the afcendant, and the
fituation ofthe Dragon's head in five degrees of the fame fign. The pla-
net Mars is fignificator of the enemy.. · .
Now the Moon, which reprefents the fhip, being fituated in the eighth

fieged by the two malefic planets Saturn 'and Mars, denotes her to. be
overpowered by the enemy. Mar.s,.. lord of the feventh, the houfe of

difpofitor of the !vloon, ~/lcrcury, aJ~Hl Venus, which rcprcfent the {hip and
crc,v, obvioufly declares thern to be in the hands of the encrny. 'fhc fig-
nificators, being pofitcd in fiery figns, indicate an cngagentcilt to ha\'c
taken pJace; but the fuperior Urcngth of the mLllellc rays of the infot-
tuncs declare it to have been of fhort duration, and of very unequal force.
The crcv: b~ing reprefented by Venus, 'vho is difpofed of by l\lars in the
t \velfth houfe, the houfc of itnprifonment and aflliB.ion, plainly fhc\\'S ·
them to be imprifoned in the enemy's country. And as rvlercurr is retro-
grade, and lituated alfo in the t\\'elfth houfe, \Vith the ~loon,s fortunate
node, it is apr.arent that the fhip and Hores \viH never be re!lored to the
owners, but ,vtll be appropriated to the ufe of the captors, or difpofed of
for their advantage. The Moon's pofition in the e1ghth houfe declares
the !hip to have been taken at a confiderable diflance from home: and
Sagittarius poflefiing the cufp of the cightl1, which is a fouth...weU fign.
and fituated in the fouth-wcfi part of the lleavens, denotes the capture to
have been made in a fouth-weit part of the world.
The querent left m~ with firong hopes of finding this judgment erro-
neous; anrl appeared fo extremely averfe to believe there could be any
truth in it, (bccau!e perhaps it operated fo much againfi his O\\'n intereH,)
that I \Vould not fuffer him to leave the room until he had promifed
upon his honou.r to let me kno'v the refult. Accordingly, in about fix
tnonths afterwards, I received a fhort note from him, informing me that
the ovvners had received advice from the captain of the privateer, that he
had fallen in with a French frigate· of twenty-four guns, \Vhich being
vaHiy fuperior to him, he was obliged; after a fhort refifiance, to firike
his colours, and was carried prifonerj \Vith the refi of the cre\v, into

Fron1 thcfe configurations I drc\v the inferences following: '1 hat !\ier-
cury, the quercntts fignificator, by being pofited in the twelfth houfe,
p]ainly {hewed her fears ,..,ere too well grounded. ~fhat Saturn, figni-
ficator of the quefitr.d, and the Part of Fortunc, being both difpofed of by
Jupiter, and this planet difpofed of by Mars, indicates all their bcnevo..
lent cfleCls Lo be dcHroyed by the malignant influence of this infortune.
Mars being in the fon)s a{cendant, in hts exaltation, and in oppofition to
Sol, is a Hrong argun1ent of a violent death; the kind and manner of
which are thus dcicribcd. Saturn, his fignificator, is pofited in the f-iery
{ign Sagittarius; and Leo, which occupies the cufp of his eighth, and
Aries the cufp of his fourth, are alfo of the fiery triplicity; the Sun,
the giYer of life., and light of time, is pofited in the \\'atery fign Cancer.
difpo{cd of by the Moon in the \Vatery fign Pifces, and the Moon by
Jupiter in the vvatery fign Scorpio; and the vvhole of their influences are
transferred to the fiery planet Mars., in his afcendant. ~rotn thefe cir-
cumHances it becatne obvious to me that the youth \Vas no longer in ex-
iHence; and that his death happened upon the water, by means of fon1e
fatal warlike inHrument, and In fame defperatc engagement with an open
enetny.
The querent then a!ked me if I could give her any fatisfaRory account
ho'v long ~go_ this har.pened. ~ took do,\?n the degrees and minutes of
the two pnnctpal figntficators, vtz. the Sun and Niars, and fubtraCled the
one from the other, ,~,.hich gave four degrees five n1inutes for the remain-
der; and thls being converted into titne by the rules before laid do\\'n for
moveable figns, in which the above fignificators were pofited, I informed
her the accident had befallen her Ion {ome\vhat more than a month before
fi1e heard the ne\VS of it. Some time after,vards a fhip arrived 'vith an ac-
count of this engagement, which happened on the coafi of I1
"rance, and
confirmed the \Vhole of this judgment.
·· QUESTION IV. On the .ProfpeR of RICHES.
A gentleman called upon me to enqu'ire, \\'hether any remarkable change
of circumflances would ever happen to hin1 in refpea of riches, and the

The lord of the afcendant, and lord of the l1our, being of one nature
and triplicity, fbews the figure to be radical. And, as Gemini occupies
the cufp of the aicendant, Mercury is its lord, and the querent's fignifi-
cator ; and being p9fited in the eleventh houfe, in a watery fign, and in
trine to Jupiter, lord of the feventh, who is here pofited in the fixth, is
a firong argument of riches by means of fervants, or of perions' in a Cub-
ordinate capacity. The Moon, who is lady of the fecond, being in her
exaltation, in trine afpea to the Sun, and applying to a· trine with Jupi...
ter, and a dexter trine afpea with Mercury, declares a great and fudden
flo\v of riches to the querent, and that unexpeaedly.
.
Being much preffed to fpeak to the particular point of tim
. e \Vhen this
good fortune fhould come up, I confidered what might be the gentle-
n1an's occupation ; and obferving Mercury to be his fignificator, and po-
fited in a watery fign, I told him that I judged he b~longed to the fea,
and had fome employment on !hip-board, in a capacity where writing or
accounts were principally concerned. This he acknowledged, by faying
he was captain's fecretary. I then obferved that his principal fignifica-
tors

tors of \Veahh and riches y,•ere alfo pofitcd in \\tatcry figns, as the !\1oon
in Cancer in the fecond houfc, and Jupiter in Scorpio in the fixth, and
the Sun and Mercury in Pifccs in the eighth, all in trine afpeCls of each
other, \Vhich plainly indicated thcfc riches were to carne by tlie fea; and
as thev \Vere to be fudden, and as it were infiantaneous, I concluded they
\vould arife by the,capture of fomc rich prize, in a fouth-eafi direClion
from London, which is denoted by the Part ofFortune being in the tw·elfth
houfe, and ''enus, its difpofitor, in Aquarius, a fouthern fign, in quar-
tile afpeEt. to the Part ofFor~une; and the Part of fortune betng oppofite
to Jupiter, lord of the feventh, the houfe of public enemies, alfo de-
clai-·es the quercnt's fortune Ihould come that \vay; which is rendered fiill
more apparent, by the Part of Fortune being in fextile to the Moon and
Mercury. When 1had mentioned thefe particulars, he frankly told me
his fhip was under failing orders, and he expetled to be called on-board
every hour.
To afcertain the time when thefe .riches fhould be acquired, I parti-
cularly noticed the application of the Moon to the lord of the afcendant,
and found them nineteen degrees diUant from a parLile trine afpeEl. But
the Moon, being [,vift in n1otion, \vith three degrees north latitude, and
Mercury having no latitude, I dedutled three degrees from the l\1oon's
place, \vhich I fet down at t\velve degrees; and then by fubtraEling
t\velve degrees from t'venty-cight degrees three minutes, which is Mer-
curv~s place, there remains fixteen degrees three minutes ; \vhich, as
the"Moon is in a moveable fign, and Mercury in a comtnon fign, is equal
to fixteen weeks, or thereabout; and therefore I concluded this good
fortune would happen to him in nearly that di!lance of time. And I have
fince had the fatisfaetion of hearing, from the gentlen1an's o\vn mouth, .
that this prediaion ,,vas literally verified by the capture of a rich priz~
\\,.ithin the tim·e fpecified.

a quartile afpeCl 'vith Ivlars, follo\\'ed by a conjunaion v;ith \'<·nus. It
further appeared to n1c that his journey would be f~r frorn plealant or
agreeable; but that on the contrary he would meet wnh great vexation,
trouble, and difc1ppointtncnt. 'ftus is indicated by the Moon's unfor-

contrary to n1y advice, and found the event, ,-.,ith all its contingencies,
cxaclly as I had predicted them.

Sotne months after, he came to me again, faying he wifhcd to take
another journey on the fame bufinefs; but, as n1y former prediaion had
fo exaB:ly correfponded with the event, he \Vas now determined to aa
itnplicitly by my advice, and therefore requeUed me to ereCt a figure to
kno\v \Vhether there were better hopes of fuccefs in his prefent under-
taking than in the former. 1.,o oblige him I drew out the figure to
the exacl time of proRofing the quellion, and, finding the benevolent af..
peas a\\ in the querent's favour, I told hi1n he had no time to lofe; for
that, if he hafiened away, fucce!s \vould cro\vn his labours. He went,
n1et the parties at home, fettled his a{:counts-, and returned \Vith his
pockets full of money, and his heart full of content; and a fe\v days af-
terwards he thanked me for my fervices.
QUESTION VI. On PATERNAL INHERITANCE.

in confequence under the difpleafure of his parents, having been threat-

The afcendant and its lord reprefent the guerent, and, as Aquarius oc-
cupies the cufp thereof, Saturn is his fignificator. The father is .repre-
fented by the fourth houfe, and · Mercury, the lord thereof, is his fig-
nificator. The fecond houfe·and its lord fignifies the querent's iubfiance;
and the fifth houfe. and its lord the fubfiance of his father. Here we
find Mercury in c.onjunai.on 'vith Jupiter in the eighth houfe, which
is the f~lt~er's fourth, ,and implies .
a Iubfi~ntial fortune, pa.rticularly as
the fun ts pofited in the fame .h<;>ufe~ 'v1th mutual receptto~ between
the t\VQ fignificators of fubHance'; 'vhereby it is evident that the fon ,vill
inherit the father's efiate and fortune. · ·
The conjunaion of Jupiter with Mercury, the father's fignificator,
is alfo a H:rong argument of paternal regard on the fide of the father ;
and therefore I informed him that there appeared to me no doubt but
he would fucceed to the eftate of his ancefiors, provided he aEled at ~11
confiHent with the duty and obedience of a fon, and would ule proper
endeavours to regain his father's good-will and forgivenefs, and aim to
be more prudent and car(!ful in fpending his income ; for the pofitio~ of

Jupiter declares him to be rcgardlefs or money among his companions
and acquaintance, and extravagantly generous and good-natured. The
conjunction of Mars 'vith \'enus like\vife fhc,vs his dcfire after ,.,·omen,
and denotes that they 'vill be.a continual fource of misfortune and ex.
p~nce to him, and \Vill help ofF pretty fafl 'vith his n1oney ; but the

ently indicates that he ''yill have a competent provilion during life.
QUESTION VII. On a CHANGE of SITUATION.
A perfon had Jo1ne time been fettled in bufinefs, without meeting 'vith

fettling in the !arne Jine ofbufinels in another place, he came and requefi-
ed lU)' advice upon the rnatter, 'vhether it would ~e mofi to his ad\'antage
to en1brace the prefent ·offer, or to continue in his former fituation. 1'o

No pofition of the planets, perhaps, could be n1ore favourable to tlie
defires of the querent, than thofe in ,the above fchetne. As Libra rifes
upon the afcendant, Venus is lady thereof, and figuificatrix of the que.
rent; and, being pofited in the fifth houfe, in her exaltation, having
the fruitful fign Pifees upon the cufp thereof, is one infallible proof
that the querent \viii have children. ..fhe 1\tloon, \vhjch is the author of
all radical moifiure, is feparating from the conjnnEhon of the Sun, the·
author of all vital fpirit, and applies to a fexti1e afpeEt of Jupiter, a be·
nevolent and prolific planet, and thence forrns a conjunfiion \\tith.
Venus, the querent,s. fignificator; and then.applies to her fortunate node.
From thefe confiderauons I hefitated not a momeJ?t to.inform the que-
rent that Ihe \Vould be the mother of a 1arge and numerous offsprtng.
'fhis is declared· by the pofition of Venus in the fifth houfe, w·hich
gives three children; and, being lady of the afcendant, in conjunftion
with the Dragon's. Head, or fortunate node of the 1\1oon, gives three
more. The Moon, being Iike,vife in conjunflion 'vith the.tn, adds three
more, and makes the number nine. AndJ as thefe configurations are

all pofited in the double-bodied fruitful fign Pifces, it doubles the nutn~
her, and declares there !hall be eighteen children. 1..his judgment is
firengthened by Jupiter's fextile afpeft with the above fignificators,
and thereby adds two more to the number ; which induced me to in-
form the lady that Ihe would in all probability be the mother of t\venty
children. ·
This is an extraordinary' infrance of the pofition of the heavens to
give fruitfulnefs and fecundity, and, what I have rareJy found either in
genitures or horary figures; and, therefore, I would wifh the reader to
note, in order to enable him to judge of other queftions of the like na.
ture, that, if the lord ofthe afcendant be in the feventh houfe, or the lord
of the fifth in the firfl:, or the 'lord ofthe firft in the fifth; or, if the lord
of the fifth be in the feventh, or the lord of the feventh in the fifth, or
the Moon pofited with them, or good planets in the .afcendant, or with
the lord of the fifth, or fituated in any of the angles; there is in none of
thefe inflances any fort of doubt but that the lady will conceive. But,
'vhen none of thefe tefiitnonies·concur, and barren figns or evil planets
occupy the above-mentioned places of the figure, fhe never has nor ever
V.'ill cqnceive. \Vhen good and evil planets are r.romifcuoufly joined
together, fhe may perhaps conceive, and have chlldren, but they will
not live, nor fcarcely ever come to maturity.-But to return :-the lady
then preffed me to 1nform her how long I thought it might be before
fue lliould conceive with l1er firfi child. To fatisfy her on this head,
I referred to the figure, and obferved the Moon within fix degrees fifty-
one tJ.1inutes of a partile conjunaion with Venus, the queen's fignifica-
trix; and, the Moon being in a common fign, I computed the time to
be at fix ·w·eeks and two days, and,·defiring her to take notice of the time,
had no doubt but fhe would foon after have reafon to believe herfelf
pregnant.
It is not lefs remarkable than true, that exaaly as I had prediaed the
event turned out; for the lady, fome months after, .very politely called
to thank me for the information I bad given her, and declared her con-
ception to have taken place as near as poffible from the time I had men-
tioned. During this converfation, fhe defired me to inform her whether
fhe was breeding with a boy or a, girl ; and, finding her ferious in the
demand, I folved it by the following figure.

angles are feminine; and the 1\1oon, ,vhich is a feminine planet, is
pofited in a ferninine fign, feparating froxn a fextile afpeEt "~ith the Sun

But, for" a m~re general mode of afcertaiping whether a lady be preg-

lord, and o( the fifth houfe and it~ lord; and note ·whether the figns ·
upon their. cufp·s be either Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, or

a female. If the lord of the afcen.dant be in a mafculine fign, and the

OUESTION X. On COURTSHIP and MARRIAGE. ..
·"""
A young lady .having for fotne time received the addrelfes of a gentle...
1nan of fortune, during which a variety of circutnfiances- had occurred
to put off the much-wi01ed-for day of confummating their nuptials; and
being alfo in doubt whether her lover ,had not fon1e attachment to an..
other lady, 'vho fhared in his affe8:ions, and fought for his cotnpany ;
fhe \Vas induced to come to me for my advice and opinion; whether the
above gentleman was really fincere in his profeffions to her, and 'vhether
their marriage fhould ever be· confummated, and when? Finding her
perfe8:Iy fincere and earnefr in her willies, and the qtiefiion truly radi-
cal, I gave her my judgment as follows:
SHALL 7HE ··-

Gentleman 1he loves ?
'
In
\
0 F A S "f R 0 L 0 G Y. 357
In this figut c the Sun is fignificator of the )u(ly-; and Saturn, lord of
t1te fevcnth houfc, is figniflcnt.or of the gentfetnan. lL rnu(l alfo be ob-
fcrved, that in this, and in all qucHions relative to matrimony, ~1ar~ an(1
he Sun are the naturul fignificators of a v/on1nn's marriage; and \'enus
nnd the l\1oon are thofe ora man's. Now Salurn, the gcnt1cman's figni-
ficator, is remarkably well pofitcd in the fiftth houfc, and has \ 'enus
\Vithin his orb, applying .to hi1n by conjuntbon ; \vhich is a very pov.'-
crful indication that his affeaions arc fincere an(l honourable, ancl that
his mind is fully bent to the n1arriagc-fiale. 1..hc Sun llkcwifc, 'being
in a fexlile af1~rcl: 'vith I\1ars, the lady's ·fignificator of ·Inarriage, plainly
fhe\vs her inclination to matrimony to be flrongly fixed, and her affec-
tions perfectly fincere.
1,hc next thing to be confidered, is, whether there be any frufiration,
or impediting afpeEl: betw·een thefe fignificat9rs; and, I 'find the Moon
and Venus, the .gentlernan's fignificators of ·tnaPriagc, are applying to a
quartile afpett with each oth.er. T~is is an evident proof that the
marriage is protonged by the interference of fame other ,..,·oman of this
gentletnan's intimate acquaintance, becaufe the afpea is made in a femi-
nine fign; b~t as the Moon, in fep~rati~g .fro.m Ve~us, applies to a.per-
feB: tnne wtth Mars, the querent s pr1nc1pal fign1ficator of ntarnage,
and alfo to a fexti!e of:the Suh·, het natu·ra1 fignificator in the figure, it
t~tally remo,·cs the evil effcfu of the tnalefic afj>eCl:, and leaves the path
free and obftrutled to the gates of Hymen. This opinion is gready
flrcngthened by confidering the mo4e in which their fignificators are
feverally difpofed. Saturn difpofes of the S't1n, who is pofited in .the
terms of Venus; at1d Venus, Saturn, and the Moon, are all difP.ofed of
by the benevolent pJ.a!let Jupiter, 'vho is hin1felf difpofed of by l\~ars,
the principal fign\ficator of this lady's m'attiage, and who thus triu•nphs
over every obfiacle to the celebration of their· nuptials.· I therefore cou1d
not hefitate in declaring to the lady, in the fullefi and mofi fatisfattory
terms, that the gentleman \V'ho courted her had a fincere and tender regard
tor her; and that, though fome circumfiances •night have happened ra.
ther unfavourable to her willies, yet fhe might re!l perfetlly alfured that
he \vas the man aJlotted to be her hu!band. ·
Apparently well fatisfied with thefc declarations, fhe pro~eedcd to in-
quire.in what length of ti1ne this defirable circuJnllance tnight come to
pafs. To gratify her \vifhes in this particular, I referred again to the
figure, \vhere the l\1oon, the gentle1nan,s /Jrincipal fignificator of tnar-
riage, 'rants upvvards of eleven degrees of arming a perfca fc.xtilc afpcEt
,. v;ith

.
with the Sun, the lord of the afcendant; and the fame to Mars, her figni.
ficator of tnarriage; and therefore, by converting the degrees into time
oy the rule heretofore given, I fixed her marriage at about the end of
three months, affuring her it would not exceed that time. The event
has-fully proved the truth of the prediElion; the lady and gentlen1an have
both done me the honour of a call fi nee the celebration of their nuptials.
and I found they v.rere married precifely at the tin1e I had predi8ed; I
have like\vife the additional pleafure to find, that my affurances to the
lady were produaive of frefh efieem and clofer attachment to the man
of her heart, and that they now live a pattern of conjugal felicity.
QU E S T I 0 N XI. On \"!A R and B AT T L E.
During the trial of a certain noble Con1mander in Chief, at the Go-
v~rnor's houfe in Portf1nouth, a company of gentlemen one day called
upon me, and requeUed I \vou]d take do\\Tn the pofitions of the planets
at the time that much-talked-of aaion commenced, and give tbem my
judgment" upon it, according to the rules of-planetary influence. Wil-
ling to oblige them in a matter which I conceived could be of no pre-
judice to any party, fince no advantage could be taken from it.; and alfo
deeming it a fit fubject whereby to manifeft the fublimity and excellence
of this art, I ,hefitated not to promife them every information in my
power. For this purpofe I ereaed my figure, not to the time this
quefi:ion was prppo~nded, for, it related to an event that had long been
paffed by, and not to ariy matter that was hereafter expe8ed to happen;
and therefore I projeCled the fcheme to correfpond with the exaa time
when this extraordinary aaion commenced, and at which moment the
heavenly bodies were under the remarkable configurations delineated in
the following fchen;1e : .

1"'he afcendaot, the Moon, and Venus, reprefent the Britifh fleet ;
Mars and Aries denote that of the enemy.. The firfl thing to be con-
fidered is the afpetl thefe two fignificators bear to one another, \vhich is
a partile fextile, a well-known tndication of imperfea love; and, as it
fhe\vs that Mars and Venus have not in themfelves an inveterate hatred,
fo it imports that the two commanders in chief did not behold each other
in an afpea of perfea and direful tnalignancy and \vrath. \Tenus, lady
of the afcendant, is pofited with Jupiter in his fall, a benevolent planet
and a Jo,·er of peace ; and, as he is in this figux e lord of the third houft:,
and \vithin fifty degrees of the afcendant, it indicates that both com.
n1anders have a defire to pron1ote peace, by aCling principally upon the
dcfenfive, and by guarding and proteaing their refpeftive coafis, \\·ithout
~ defire of any clofe or decifive aClion, or of venturing to any great dif:
tance fro1n horne. '
The cool, cautious, deliberate, planet Saturn: is fituated in the fir !I
boufe, and indic~nes not fo much a d~fire for hot nnd prec;pitate aftio n

as for felf-prefervation, or the proteaion of national wealth ; and this is
plainly exemplified in the Britifh adrn1ral's watchfulnefs and care in
covering and proteCting the hon1e,vard-bound India fleet, as \~·ell as in
the French admiraJ,s retiring after he found his view·s. upon that rich
and unguarded flota Vvere cotnpletely fruflrated. The pofition of Mer-
cury, being combufi of the Su11, and difpofer of the Moon, Venus, and
Jupiter, a.nd lord alfo of the t\\"elfth houfe, the houfe of private enrnity
and malice, indicates private· rancour and enmity in a fubordinate com-
mander ·; and, as Mercury is pofited bet\veen the t\~'0 fignificators, Venus
and Mars, evilly dignified, and combufi, fo he denotes the perfon repre-
fented by him will 1nfailibly be governed by malevolent principles, and
ufe his influence to retard the objeB: of the bufine['> in hand. ']'he truth
of this indication has, I .think, been too well efl:ablifhed to need any
further illufiration from n1e.
The enemy, as I have before obferved, is reprefented by Mars, who
is pofited in the tenth houfe, the houfe of honour, and in the fign of
his triplicity, but in the digniti~s of Jupiter; and this fhevvs that the
enemy vvould as mt~ch as poHible avoid clofe aEt.ion, but 'vould take the
advantage to fhift front fighting; and l\1ars, being in his falJ, deprives
the enemy of their honour, and clearly proves, that, if a clofe and \vell-

an atrocious robbery and burglary \Vas, during that titne, committed in
the neighbourhood, in the houfe of a poor old blind decrepid man, \\'ho,
by hard labour and rigid economy in his younger days, had fa\·ed up
three hundred pounds to divide among his children at his death. Tlus
money \vas kept in a firong chell by the bedfide 'vhere the poor old man
lay; when fome villains, watching an opportunity in the abfence of his
family, made their way into his apartmcnt, broke open the chefi, and
carried off all the money undifcovered. l\tly friends hereupon tnade it

The fign Taurus, ·o~cupying the afcendant, givesVenus for the querent'.s
fignificatrix ; the Moon, Jady of the fourth, reprefents the querent's
father, and the feventh and tenth houfes are· to denote the thieves; and,
the reafon I allot two houfes for thetn is, becaufe the feventh houfe of
the figure is·the natural fignificator of thieves to the querent, ·Nho \Vas ,
heir to part of the rn·oney, and had been pr9mifed it by his father, and
confequendy bore a !hare in the lofs; and the tenth houfe being the
father's feventh, reckoned from his firfl:, or fourth. in the figure, natu-
rally ·denotes thieves to him ; and therefore, as the fon is querent, and
the father had the principal fhare in the lofs, both thefe houfes n1ufl: be
vvell confidered, before any account can be given of the thieves.
,
II ere I find Jupiter, lord of the eighth and t~velfth houfe, pofited in
the tenth1 out. of ~It his e!fential dignities, in his fall, and co-fignifica-
tor with Mars; wherefore, I declared two perfol\S to be concerne~ in the
robbery, and dcfcribed thern according to thefe fignificators, viz. a nlid-
dle O:a1ur~-1 \Vith dark br0\\7

fition, one fonlC\\'hat {hortcr than the other; an(l appeared to be fon of

lVIy nrxt Lufincfs \\'as to confidcr ,,·hut \vac; done \Vith the rnoncy ; and,
as there arc t\\'O fignificators in refpea of the qucfiion, nan1f')y, tire fc--
''cnth houfes and their lords, fo there tnuU be t\\"O to rcprcfcnt the dif-
pof:'ll of the money; and thefc are the fourth ltoulcs and their lords.
Accordingly I find the Moon, \\'ho governs the querent's fourth houfe,
pofited in Scorpio, a \~atery fign; and, being alfo undcrnealh the fign, I
declared fornc part of the rnoney \vas buried underneath a rock or Hone
over ,,.bjch the tide flo,ved, and near the habitation of the thieve-;,
which I judged \Vas not far diflant fro1n the fca-fide. Again, I find "'!vlars
lord of the father's fourth, pofited in Capricorn, a befiial fign, in con-
junaion \\"ith Jupiter, \vho governs corn, and V.'ith Saturn, \\·ho rules
the fruits of the earth; and, as Mars is the ljghter planet, and applies to
Jupiter, and as jupiter is in the term of Saturn, I concluded that ano-
ther part of the money had been paid a\vay to fame hufbandman or far-
mer, ,vho refided about the difiancc of eight miles !outh fron1 the place
'vhere the robbers lived.
When thefe circumfiances 'vere all thro\\'n·together, and each duly
confidered, fufpicion fell upon t\\'0 perfons, \Vho were brothers, in every
refpea anf,\·ering to this defcription, and \Vho, upon enquiry, they found
had paid one hundred pounds to a farmer three days after the robbery
was committed, 'vho lived in the fituation above defcribed, and "·ho
had for fome time threatened the parties 'vith an atljon, on account of
their backv;ardnefs or inability to pay him. Upon this I \\'as a{l:ed, if
the parties \Vere taken up, \vhether any of the money \\'O!-tld be reco,·ered?
To anf,,·er thi5, I referred again to the figure, and noted the fituation
of the t"'O luminaries, both of ,.,~hich are ailliCled. The light of time
is pofited in the t\\1
elfth houfe, in conjunClion with Venus, lady of the
~rccndant, and fignificatrix of the querent, \\'"hich affords one flrong a-r-
gument againfl recovering the money. The ~'loon is alfo greatly riHli&-
cd in the fixth houfe, and in no afpea either to the Sun or to the
afcendant, but on the contrary is applying to a trine of I\1ercury, lord
of the fixth, and this t:> a fextile of Saturn, lord of the father's fixrh,
and alfo the fignificators of the t\\'O thjeves ; all ,..·hich pofitions give the
Hrongefi proofs of an utter in1poffibility of recovering any part of the
property, particularly as both the fignificators of the qucrent and his
father are greatly .afHiCled by accidental pofitions, as \\·e-Il as by the
part of fortune being in conjuntlion "'"ith the Moon's unfortunate

recovery.
~!any circun1fiances, hovvever, afterwards concurring, to confir~ this
.. fufpicion of the two brothers abQVe alluded to, they \vere in confequence
taken into cuHody, and .examined before feveral of the coun~y magif-
trates, who found fuH1ctcnt gr~unds to commit them for tnal at the
.next -affizes. 'fhey were in confequence arraigned; but, though fuf-
picion fell heavy upon thetn, yet, as no pofitive evidence could be
adduced to prove they \vere caught in the faa, or to identify the money,
they were botl? acquitted, not\vithflanding the long train of well-con-
nected at~d __concurring circumfiances, which came out upon the trial,
left them guilty in the eyes of aU the court.
QU E S T I 0 N XIII. On L E G A C I E S.
A perfon of a free and convivial humour called upon me to enquire
concerning a legacy which his 'vife~s mother had often promifed to
leave them at her death; but, having had [orne high words, in confe- .
quence of his Ioofe way of living, fhe had lately refcinded her former
promifes ; and, as this lay upon his mind, and had vexed hitn for fome
days pail, he was now defirous to know~, by the celefiial intelligencers,
whether this legacy would be 'left him or not. Finding the man fin..
cere in/his ,vifhes, 4nd, deeming the queftion rerfeEtly radical, I pro-

Mercury is here lord of the afcendant, and fignific~tor of the querent ;
he is fituated in the feventh houfe, and difpofe~ of Jupiter, the fignifi..
cator of his wife, who is pofited in the fourth, his own houfe, firong
and po\verfu1, and in trine afpea to the Sun. The Ivloon's fortunate
node likewife falls in the wife's fecond houfe, in fexti]e afpeCl to the part
of fortune in the querent's fecond; all \Vhich are very pow·erful tefii-
monies that the quer~nt's \Vife would not lofe her inheritance. This
opinion is alfo firengthened by the pofttion of the benevolent planet
Jupiter, who is lord of Pifces, and the \vife:s fignificator, and lord alfo
of the \vife's tenth, and fignifi~ator of the mother, viz. the fourth houfe
in the figure; which evidently fhe,vs a mutual love and attachment be..
t\veen the n1other and daughter, that nothing but death can efface, and
to which inheritance will follow. · ·

. 'vith, plainly marilfefis the querent to be of an effeminate mind and fpi-
rit, content to give up all rule and government to his wife, fo he has
but the enjoyment of his. friend and his bottle.
The fituation of the Sun and the Dragon's Head in the wife's fecond,
or querent's eighth, denotes that he had beretof<?re received a legacy by
the death of his wife's father ; which being mentioned, he readily· ~con­
felled that it was fo. 1'his legacy he appears to have fquandered away,
as is manifefted by the part of fortune being in conjun&ion with the
Dragon's 'Fail in the fecond houfe. And now, taking all the·foregoing
afpeas together, and noting that the Sun, the natural fignificators of
fa~hers, is- pofited in his exaltation, with the. Moon's fortunate node,
and free from_all frufiration or affiiaion; and notw'ithflanding the que-
rent had fquandered away the firfl: legacy by the father, and had lately
fallen out with the mother ; yet I hefitated not to declare, th~t, accord-

through her affeaion and anxioufnefs for the welfare and happinefs of

dertaken to declare it too 'veak for the objea of its defiination, and that
it would fall ..an ea(v prey to the enemy ; I was therefore the more rea-

The vvatery !ign Aquarius; falling upon the afcendant, gives Saturn for
the admiral's fignificator ; and, as Pifc~s alfo falls intercepted· in the
firfi houfe, Jupiter, lord thereof, mufl: have confignification of all thofe
that accotnpanied him. The ninth houfe reprefents the voyage, the firfi.
houfe or atcendant the port or fiation from whence they fet fail, the fe-
venth houfe the quarter to whicli they are defiined, and the lord thereof
.denotes the obfl:acles or enemies they fhall meet with ;·the fourth houfe
reprefe_!lts the completion of the voyage, and the accomplifhment and
tcrn1ination of the objetl or bufinefs of the expedition; the \vhole of
which arc to be feparated and difiinaly contemplated.

only as a dark cloud, vvhich, ,vhen the fiorrn is over, quickly gives way
to the all-Lhcering and enlivening beams of the refreJhing Sun. And
this i~ evinced by the admiral's fignificatpr having juft feparated fron~
this malignant configuration, and after,vards forming a propitious fextile
afpeEt in the'zodiac, and a mundane trine afpea to the fecond houfe, the
houfe of prorperity, fortune, and riches, aid~d by Mars, the lord thereof,
'"'-ho is fituated in the firfi houfe, and in his ovl"n triplicity.
In examining thefe ftgnificators, I find Saturn, who reprefents the
admiral, is rlifpofed of by Jupiter, lord of the tenth houfe, the houfe of
princes, _which fhe\VS his appointment catne from the king .himfeJf.
Venus, lady of the enemy's houfe of fubflance, as well as all the fignifi-
cators of the enemy, and part of fortune aifo, arc difpofed of by Saturn,
lord of the afcendant ;·and Mars, the natural fignificator of war, and
lord of the Britifh admiral's houfe of fubfiance and riches, is pofited
in the afcendant, in trine to Scorpio, his own fign, in the ninth,. the
houfe of fea-voyages; and, being•a}fo in his OWn triplicity, fhe\\I"S that
~his voyage !hall be profper?us and importan~.. This judgment is greatly
Jtrengthened by :the pofittori of the prop1t10us fixed Uar Fon1ahaut,
in the firfl houfe ; which, being of the nature of Venus and Mercury,
a_nd of the firfi magnitude, and joined with Mars in Pifces, declares
great _
riches, honour} and preferment, !hould be acquired by this voy-
age, and fuch as fhould place the noble com1nander above the frowns
and malice of poth his public and private enemies.
The fign on the feventh houfe, and the intercepted fign Virgo, {hew
the deflination of the fleet ; and the Sun and Mercury reprefent the
encmi~s they fhall meet with; and, as the lord of the feventh is pofited
in a fign that has rnore planets lvithin its degrees than one, fo it points
out that the admiral fhalt be engaged with more. fleets than one. Here
is alfo a mofi remarkable reception between Venus and~ Mars in exalta-
tion; Mars being pofited in the fign of the exaltation of Venus, and
Venus in the fign of the exaltation of Mars; and, as Venus is lady of the
enen1y's houfe of fubHance, this reception declares that the Britifh fleet
will capture many rich and noble prizes, and make great havock with
the fubfiance or riches of the enemy. Mars being in fexti1e afpeEl: with
the part of fortune, and the Sun lord of the {eventh, fhews thefe prizes
lhall be taken with much fighting. And that the viaory fhall declare
itfelf on the fide of the Englifh, is rnanifefied by Venus, fignificatrix
of the enemy's fubflance,· being difpofed of by Saturn, the lord of the
afcendant, and fignificator of the Britilli admiral.

Brief OBSER\TA.TIONS in drawing a Defcription from the PLANET
that is LOl{D of the ASCENDANT.
I: If no plane"t be in afpetl \vith the lord of the afcendant, then judge
of the Rative by the lord of the afcendant \Vholly, without any regard
to the fign in \\'hich he is pofited. · ·
II. If the lord of the afcendant be retrograde, or in his fall or detri-
ment, then defcribe the native 'vith ·due reference to the natl}re of thae.
fign in which he is fo pofited.
III. If the lord of the afcendant behold the afcendant at the time of
birth, then judge of the native by the quality of the fign upon the cufp
of the afcendant.
IV. Iftwo planets happen to be in afpea 'vith the afcendant, take
your judgment from him \vho is mofi perfeB: in partile, and pofited in
his o\vn houfe, rather than from him ,vho is ~in his exaltation.-Thefe
obfervations are to be confidered as \veil in regard to the difpofition and.
qualities of the mind as inthe defcription and formation of the body.

. A NATIVIr-
Y, or -Genit~re, is t~~. very tnoment of birth, or precife
time of the. child's coming in~o th_~ world, stnd in \Vhich he is
made a vifible member of the creation.. In this moment it is that the
fiars begin to aa and operate their influence upon the nevv-born infant,
by the power or _
intervention of thofe angels 'who rule and govern the
c~onflellations then leve] with-the horizon, or that afcend upon the ho-
rofcope, according to that faying of St. Jeron1e, in his comtnent upon
the eighteenth c~_apter of St. Matthew, where he fay~, Great is the dig·
nity of fouls, for every one at their fiifl corning into the tvorld ha·ve an an-
gel appointed jor their czffl_ody and faftty. And, as it is from thefe confi..
gurations that 've are enabled to point out the incidents-of the natiye~s
future life, fo is it abfolute1y neceffary that the very infiant of pjrth
!hould be well 'and n1inutely afcertnined, in order to arrive at corretl.ne(s
and certainty in thefe _
[peculations. It tnufi be obvious to every one,
~hat the celeH:ial bodies are in perpetual ~otion, and therefore eyery
quarter of an hour tnuft confiderably vary their pofition; as do~s alfo
different parallels from any one given point of the heavens; and .hence
it· is that the latitude, as V."ell as the true time of birth, becomes fo abfo-·
l~ut~lr neceifary in calculating or bringing up the diretlions of a
natlvtty.
By knowing the place of birth, the latitude is eafily afcertained;
but.to determine the pieci~e tltne of a·native's emerging from.the '\yon1b
is a circun1ftance that has been always found difficult and precarious; I
not only on account of the inattention of nurles and mid\vives to this
mofi interefting event, but alfo by reafon of the difference and uncer-
tainty of almofi all clocks, watches, and diaJs, in reference to the
Sun~ Wherefore the ancient profeffors of this art, to remove the
~rrors in the common or eHimate tin1e of birth, have contrived fe..
veral ways o( reaifying a nativity; and have given fuch rules for this
purpo!e, that the true t1me of birth may be thereby correB.ly afcertain--
ed. This reaification may be effeaed three different ways ; firfi, by
-the Trutinant 1-Iernzett·s, or Trutine of Hern1es; fecondly, by the Anx-
moder of Ptolemy ; and, thirdly, by the natural accidents qj. the native.
Thefe three methods I fhall explain fully, when I come to treat of the
reEiiftcations of nativities; fuffice it here to fay, that the method mofl.ly

genitut·es of gro\vn perfons, is that of rcElifying by fuch accidents as
might have befallen thenl during their p~ft life.
As the doarine of nativities is the very elfence of Afirology, and the
principal criterion by which mankind will judge of the utility and rea-
fonablenefs of the fcience, it will be rcquifite for me in this place to be
as plain and circucnfiantial as poffible. It cannot he unentertaining, nor
wholly ufelefs, even to a commom reader, much lefs to thofe \vho mean to
ftudy the nrr, to knov1 the true grounds upon \vhich this part of the
fcicnce is founded ; together \Vi th thofe afpeds or configurations at
birth, from which our predictions are framed; and the tin1e alfo when
their influence and effeCts will vifibly operate upon the body or affairs
of the native. In elucidating this fubject, I lhall be principally guided
by the ~adripartite of the great Ptolon1y: the truth and excellency
of whofe doCtrine th~ experience of many ages, and the obfervation of
the moft intelligent profe1Tors of this art, have fully eftabliilied and
confirn1ed.
It is manifeft to the moft fuperficial obferver, that a certain feeret
power is diffufed through all things that are near the earth, according
to the nature and properties of the firmament, and circuman1bient
air, and to the power and influence of the luminaries and other ce-
lefiial bodies. The Sun, being the {uperior lurninary and the foun-
tain of life, governs all things that bear relation to the earth, not only
by varying the feafons, and bringing to perfection the feeds of anin1als,
and the fruitfu1nefs of plants, the ftovving of \Vaters and the n1utation
of bodies, but alfo the changes of the day, of heat and moifi:ure, of
drynefs and cold, as it hath refpeB: to the n1eridian, ·or rnid-heaven.-
The Moon n1fo, being neare!l: to the eartb, difiils do\vn ~n atna~ing in-
fluence, by \''hich things aninlate and inanimate are aft~Cted and changed.
Rivers are augrnented and diminifhed according to her light ; the tides
vary as the rifes and fets; plants and animals, in \Vhol~ or in part~ in-

which allo things on earth are fuitably governed; and their mutuJI con-
figurations, as their influences co-operate with or oppofc one anotberJ
produce variations nccordingly.

employ lo.nger time, according to their declination~ or as t~ey appear o~
di [appear in our horiz~n. f-Jence then, by the rttles of nature, and the
tellimony of our own reafon and e~per~ence, it 1nuft be admitted, that
of all the planets, the influence of the Sun is. the moft povterful ~ and·
that the influence of the other planets- have mofr energy, ~!hen the

The errors of thofe W
·ho do not underfiand the fundan1cntal princi-
ples of this Je.1rning have doubtlefs afForded firong /and plaufible renfons
to the bulk of n1aokind for difcarding it altogether, and for confidering
thofe events \vhith others have more fuccefsfully afcertained ro be the
effeCts of n1cre chance. But furely a doB rine is not to be rejected, be-
caufe fome of its followers are vicious or ignorant. In this fpeculalion.
above all others, reafonable allowances iliould be n1ade, :ts \Veil for the
\veaknefs of human comprehenfion, as for the great and undefinable ex-
tent of the cooternplation. Much depends upon the ability of the phy-
.fician, in modifying and proportioning his prefcription, not only to cor-
refpond \Vith the ll:ate of'" the diteafe, but alfo \Yith the temperature and
confiitution of the patient. In this fu bject under confidenlti!)n, a judg-
ment no lefs fr.1gacious is abfolutely nece~ary; becauf~ the quality of the
heavenly n1atter is often conjectural, and the mixture of di.ffer~nt af-
peets and influences are fometimes fo complicated, that. the brighteft
underfianding can fcarce1y arrange them with precifion.
~
But the confideration ·of Nati\~itics, in points \vhich relate co the par-
ticular temper and difpo~tion of 'refpedive perfons, hath other caufes
in nature too apt to be forgotten, or perhaps lightly puffed over as cir-
cumfi3oces of no moment. But it is undeniably true, and muft be ad-
mitted on all hands, that the place of birth will often make confiderJ-
ble difference in thofe who are born ; and though the feed be the fame
from wnic·h they are procreated, and though the confiitution of the
heavens be the farne, yet the diverfities of countries \vherein they are
bo/n will naturally produce a difference in their bodies and minds. B=-
fides this, a difft!rent education and cufio1n will form a different difpo-
iition and manner of life; as does alfo the difrerent fituJtion or clalfcs

Therefore he who does not attentively confider each of thcfe difiinCl:ions.
and unite thetn judicioufly with the caufes produced by the ambient and
heaven1y matter, will 1neet vvith great uncertain,ty in his conc)ufions. '
For, although the power,of heaven is confeffedly tbe greatcfi, and with
thefe all the others are conceived as adjuvant -caufes, ,yet they do not al..
ways affume the circutnar?bient matter as. a concanfe; confequeotly
thofe who attempt to pred1a from the motton of the heavenly bodies
alone without due reference to thefe confiderations, will entail contentpt
tlpon themfelves, and difgrace upon the fcien.ce•
.But that afiro1ogical prediElions nre poffible, and to·be _
defined \vith
great precifion, VJhen properly managed, is an affertion moft true, and
\vhich, I flatter myfelf, I have already made manifefi. It remains,
therefore, that '\Ve fpeak of the advantages of this benevolent difpenfa-
tion of Providence; for if a foreknowledge be advantageous or necef-
fary to the fafety and future happinefs of the foul, what can be more fo in
refpeel to the body, fince it affords not only temporal delig~t, happinefs,
and pleafure, but enables us .to underfiand things both divine and hu-
1nan ;? Whatever happens in the courfe of nature, either neceffarily ~or
accidentally, that materially affects our profperity or adv~rfity, and either
prolongs life or deftroys it, if they happen fuddenly and unexpectedly,
confound with fear, or tranfport \Vith joy; but, if they are foreknov1n~
they fortify the mind by fuch forek~owledge, and prepare it for fufi:ain- .
ing the beft or .worft occurrences wuh callnnefs and ferenity. In \Vhat
refpeCt therefore is man fu perior to the-irrational part of the creation, if
he cannot bear to know the hour of his difiolution? The terms of our ex..
ifience, as every day's experience repeatedly lhews, are that \Ve mufr
fuffer death. Where then, to minds fraught with reafon and integrity,
can be the horror, the difir~fs, or calamity, of knowing the ·time when
that certain event fl1all take place? '"fo men of a virtuous habit, fuch
a knowledge mu~ be invaluable; and to ·thofe. of lefs fcrupulous prin-
ciples, it cannot be un\velcotne, provided reafon or philofophy 1nake up
any part of their coni~ituti~n•. T~ n1en of the moll: exe1npla..ry conduCt,
it affords fit opportunuy of adju!l:•ng thet~ temporal conterns, and re-
lieves them under the difireffes and afflictions of this life, by afcertain-
ing the pex:iod of their fufferings, and by giving them hopes of retribu-
tion and reward in that which will fucceed. To the incoofideraced :~nd

We are not ho\vevcr to believe, that the accidents and events of life

caufe front above, by \vbich they are of neceffity brought to paf<:, no
other caufe being able to oppofe or prevent theo1. It \vere unphiJofo-
phica1 and abfn-rd thus to itnagine; for the motion of the heavenly bo-
dies is imn1ntable by divine Ja\v, and the mutation of earthly things is
difpofed of and revealed by a natural generation and order, \vhich the f.u-
perior caufe follo\VS by accident_. 1t is a) fo to be obferved, that mlny
things happen to man, not only by rcafon of the natural and proper qua..
Iity of the heavenly n1atter, but alfo by the operation of fomc n1ore uni-
verfal caufes; as by great n1utations and mixtures of the elen1ents, plagues
and peftilences, and floods and conflagrations, are produced, by \Vhich
multitudes are at once fwep·t a\vay, and perilh under one corhmon fata-
lity. 1-h us greater caufes al \vays overcon1e the Jefi't:r, and the fironger

Other things like\vife happen to individuals. becaufe the natural proper-
ty of each is overcome by the contrariety of the circumarnbient matter,
\Vhether the antipathy thereof be fmall or fortuitous. No\V this being
admitted, it becomes apparent that of thofe things \Vhich happen gene-
rally and particularly, be the accident whatever it tnay, whofe firft

which have a \·Veaker caufe are overthrown, if any other caufe, ·able to

thofe accidents happen agreeable to the nature and in1pulfe of their firft

by n(!ceffity, but becaufe the antipathy by which it might have been
defiroyed is neither koo\vn nor to be defined. Thus it happens to

neceffarily, and others not, except \vhen fotnething is found of fuffici-
ent ftrength to oppofe their efficient po\ver. Hence it is demonfirable~
that, though fimple ·caufes have natural properties peculiar to themfelves,
yet there are other caufes equally fimple, \Vhich operate in contaCt with
thofe of the former, and by which the bare fitnple nature of each is
changed by mutation into a third quality, vvbich differs in nature from
either of, the forn1er; according to vvhich fuch fin1ple natural proper-
ties are either partly or wholly changed, or otherwife ·fruftrated or di-
verted. As for example, in the weather, the Sun, in his O\Vn fimple
nature,' is the fountain of light and heat; bnt, being joined with Saturn,
never fails~ if not preve~ted by fame other apparent.caufe, both in win-
ter and fummer, t? produce cold and cloudy weather. But, if Mars hap-
pens to be joined iil configuration with tbetn, the cafe is altered, and,
]nfiead of co]d, the weather \¥ill not fail, in fummer to be hot and ful-
try, though at the fan1~ time cloudy, corrufcuous, and diforderly; and
in \vintcr, remarkably clofe and warm, though lo\vering and turbulent;
more efpecially if,attended with a new or fu11 Moon. Thefe are fatl:s
.founded upon a rational hypothefis, and proved by long experience and
confian t obfervat ion. .
•
Thefe prelin1inaries being laid down, a~ confidered as the ground.·
~ork of Aft.rology, it follo\vs that ·thofe, who would \Vifu to be proficient
in it, fhould learn to preditl: futurities after a natural way, by fuch prefci'-
ence as nature has pointed out,- and not by an inconfiderate or vain opi-
nion that this !hall happen, becaufe it hat~ many.great and efficient
caufes which it is impoflible to refifl:; or that this ihall not happen,
becaufe it hath refifiing affeCl:ions. Calculators of nativities, therefore,
"'hen· they (peak of thofe things which n1ay come to pafs, can do it in
no other \vay conformable to truth and nature, but by the power and
effeC1s of the circumambient matter or afpeds, which, being more or
lefs inclined to fuch a temperatllre, \Vill produce fuch an accident,· fta-
tnre of body, or difpofition of mind. As when a phyfician afferts that
an ulcer will eat away or putrefy, or a naturalill: that the Ioadftone will
.
attrat1 iron; not becaufe it is necelfary that the ulcer lhould eat a\¥ay
or putrefy, or the loadfione attraCt; but, if the contraries are not known,
nor their effects prevented, thefe circumfiances "'ill affuredly happen~
3Ccording to the caufe and confequences of things, as they have been
from the beginning of the world. Thus it happens, and thus we ought
to judge, in the calcu]atiori of n~tivities ; for thofe events which per-
petually.fall in upon all hun1an .affairs are produced according to the
!ucfeillon of natural order, either becaufe. things that rnay oppofe and
prevent
I
0 I~ A S T R 0 L 0 G Y. 397
prevent :tre not found, or becaufc they are not kno\\'n.. And :~gain,
events kno\vn natur,\lly, and according to order, and thofe things being
found \Vhich difitgree and oppofe, they are then either \Vholly prevented
or elfe come to pafs \vith very fo1all ctrcet, and are fc~rcely vifible in
their operation.
Novv, feeing there is' both in generals and p3rticulars fuch a confe-
quence, it is curious to ren1~rk, that, though rnany people believe in gt•
nera!J, and allow it is poflible to prognofiicate upon that fyftem, and 31-
fo think it advantageous to\vards prefcrvation and health, yet in parti-
culars they \vill not allo\v the farne operations to have any force. For
many confefs they know the proper feafons, and the lignification of the
fixed ftars, and the afpcds of the Moon, and they obtcrvc thc1n for the ~
e1lablilhn1ent of their health, and to reduce their conllitutions to a good
and regular temperature, in fummer by cooling rnedicaments, and in
\vinter by beating. 1'hey alfo obferve the fignifications of the fixed
fiars for the purpofes of navigation, and they plant, and fo\v, and for-
\vnrd vegetation, by obferving the different afpeCls of the 1\1oon; and
no one fuppofes thefe general effects either itnpoffible or ufelefs. But
in particulars, as of cold or heat, which increafe and decreafe in their
proper temper, and by the properties and tnixtures of other matter, they
neither believe it poflible to foretel, or conceive that \Ve n1ay be pre-
fcrved frorn, the confequences attending tnen1. But the caufe of this
opinion, is the difficulty of knowing particulars, and the managemen~
of them with precifion and truth; and, becaufe rnen are feldom found of
fo penetrating a con1prebenfion, that none of the contraries be hidcjen
fro1n their view, hence the oppofing power or inflnence, for the mo!l:
part, not being joined \Vith a forekno\vledge in the eff\!tl. produced by firH:
caufes •Nithout impediment, they judge of things fi1nply, as though
immutable and impoffible to be prevented. But, as in the nrt of predic-
tion its pofi]bility appears 'worthy of confidenition, although it is notal-
together· infallible, this prefervative part is certainly \Vorthy of particu-
lar regard, fince it n1ay bring relief to many, though not a perte~ cure
to a11. For this reafon the Egyptians, finding the efficacy of this art,
every \vhere joined phyfic to prognofiic aftronomy; and hence it is ap-
parent, that, if they had thought futurities could not be removed or di-
verted, they would never have prefcribed certain remedies and preferva-
tives againfi: the effeCt of the ambient, prcfent or to come, n'bethcr in
.general or particular cafes; they therefore fought out a method at once
advantageous' and profitable, that, by afirology, the quality of the fuhj3-
cent ten1perarnents, Uf1d the accidents which come to pafs by the inHu-
~nce of the heavenly bodies) might be difcovered and known; but by

the medicJ} art to difiinguiili the fympathies and antipathies of each,
and to underfiand the natural cure of prefent difea(e, and the true
tnode of preferv at~on fron1 future. For, without this fpecies of afi:ro....
non1ic k nqv;ledge, the medical art is found in n1any cafes to fail ;
though I am ready to allo\V that there are not -remedies to be found for
all bodies and difeafes•
.
' .
, The(e oofervations become clear and obvious, frotn a confideration
of the planets and their afpeEls. The Sun is fou nd by nature to caufe
heat and drynefs in a moderate degree. His po\Ver and influence are Oloft
vifible to our fenfes, by reafon of his magnitude, and the manifefi nlu.-
t ation of the feafons; for, by ho\V n1uch the nearer he, approaches to
our vertical point, by fo much the rnore he ftirs up heat in us, and
fubjeets us to his nature. But the nature of the Moon is chiefly nloifi.-
ening; for, being nearer the earth, ilie exhales the vapours of all moifi:
bodies, and thus evidently ~ffetts all n1oitl: things, and putrefies them;
but, becaufe of her analogy with the Sun, ihe moderately participates of
heat. The planet Saturn cools and dries, becaufe he is far diil:ant from
the heJt of the Sun and vapours of the earth ; but he cools moft abun-
dant1y, and dries n1oil.: moderately.' The other planets alfo receive
virtue according to the configurations they make with the Sun and
Moon. Mars drieth much, and burns, becaufe of his hot and fiery na-
ture; but the influence. of Jupiter is temperate, becaufe he moves be-
tween the coldnefs-of S aturn and the heat of Mars. Ve.nus hath nearly
the fame temperature, but in a different meafnre, becaufe of her vicini-
ty ro the Sun; lh.e moiftens mofl:, as does the Moon, through the great-
nefs of their light, by \vhicb they aifutne the 1noifture of the vapours of
the earth. Mercury fon1etirnes dries, and fonletimes moiftens; according
to his pofition and configuration with other il.:~rs. Hence arife the four
principal humours, whence all bodies are engendered. Two of them
are generative an~ '!_ctive, the hot and the moifr; for by thefe are
all things joined together, and increafed : and tv/o are corruptive and
hurtful ; the dry ?nd the cold ; for by thefe all things are di!folved
and deftroyed. Wherefore two of the planets, viz. Jupiter and Venus, are
defined to be benefics, becaufe of tbeir benevolent temperature,. and
becaufe heat and tnoifture equally abounds in then1; and like wife .the
Moon, for the fame reafons. But Saturn and Mars, being of an oppo·
:fite nature,·and defined to b~ of~ malevolent and deflructive influence, by
reafon of the extreme cold of the one and the violent heat of the other.
But the Sun and Mercury, being of\a controvertible nature, are found to
produce both thefe influences, according to tbe nature, force, and qua- ·
lity1 of the afpeets or c_
onfigurations they make with other bodies.
' As

Ae there nre four dit1i~a humours or qualitic s incident to the pl:~nets,
· fo arc there t\VO prin1nry fexes hy \Vhich they nre dHl:ingui!hcd, namely,
the m~fculinc and the feminine. '1 he fcanininc planets p.1rt 1kc princi-
p:llly of rnoiflurc; therefore the Moon and Venus are tenncd fe1nininc,
bccanfe 010ifturc chiefly abounds in thcnl. But Saturn, Jupitcr, rvLlrS,.
nnd the Sun, are n1afculine, bccaufe they heat and dry \Vith the greater
energy. J.Vlercury, in point of fex, is confidered indiff<!rently, becauf~
he equally dries or Jlluill:cns as occafiori rnay be. ~rhe fiJ.rs are like-
\\'i fc conlidercd, os to fcx, according to th~ir polition with the Sun!P
\ Vhen they nre oritntal, nud going before ' thc Sun, they become nlafcu-
linc; but, \Vhen they are occidental, and follow the Sun, they arc: fe...
n1inine. 1·hc t\VO Clpparent difiinEt ions of time, called day and night~
are alfo divided into fexcs. ,.fhe day, becaufe o_f its heat and atlivity~
is tenued rnafculine; and the night, becaufe of its moill:ure, and con...
veniency for refi, fen1inine; therefore the Moon and Venus are noCtur-
nal, und the Sun and Jupiter diurnal; but Mercury is in this refpeEI:
alfo inoiftcrent, diurnal \vhen in an oriental fituation, and nocturnal
\vhen occidental. But the two rnalevolent planets, Saturn and Mars, are
confidered diurnal and noCturnal, not according to their quality and
nature, as heat to he~t, but contrary; for a good temperament, taking
its like, maketh the good greater; and unlike, rnixed \virh evil, deClroys
much of that evil; therefore S:tturn, as cold, is joined to the heat of
the day; and Mars, as dry, to the anoHl:ure of the night. So each of
them, becoo1ing tnoderate in their influences, will appear confonant to the
conditjons which give the temperament. It is alfo to be remarked, that
a planet is diurnal, when in a diurnal nativity above the earth and in a
noCturnal nativity under. the earth; but ?JoC/urnal, \vhen in a no8:urnal
nativity above the earth or in a diurnal nativity under the earth.
N O\V the influences and eff<:Cl:s of the planets have flnaller or greate~
force, ;!Ccording to their afpeCl:s and configuration \vith the Sun; for
the i\1
1oon along her increafe, from her firfl appearance to the firft"
quarter, is moifiening; from the firfl: quarter to her full, !he \Varn1s;
from the full to the )aft qu~1rter, fl1e dries; and) from the laft quar..
ter till {he is hid, i11e is cold. The planets 1natutine to the firft fLl-
tion are n1ore n1oift; froen the fir!l: fiation till they rife at night,
they are tnore heating; froan their riling at night to the .fecond !l:Jtion,
they dry 1nore; and, from the fecond fiat ion, they cool more. The firft
fiat ion is when a planet ·begins to be retrograde; and the fecond ftation,
when from retrogradation it becotnes direct; and they begin to rife at
night \Vhen in oppofition to the* Sun. Thus the po\ver of thefe.va-
rtous
* The rifing ·and fetting of the fiars are threefold; cofmical, achroniC':\1, and hclia~ti.-­

little. Thofe of the greateft n1agnitode are the mofi: po\verful and ef-
'{lcacious ~ and thofe in or near the ecliptic have tnorc energy than thofe
remote frorn it. The bright ftars have more influence than the dull
and languid i thofe of a red colour partake of ' the quality of Mars;
thofe of a ]~ad colour operate with fitnilar effeCt to Saturn: and fo of

it is npp:trcnt, that, ~ccording to the conllitution of the (eafons, of ages,
and of the angles, the e~cient povter and influence of the fiJrs vary;
and, \vhen there is no contr~ry conftitution, the ftars have a flrongcr
influence, hcc.nufe it is unanixed ; for, in heating, they that are moll hot
are n1of1 po\verful; and, in n1oift confiitutions, thofe are the 1nofi po·N-
crful tvhich nre of a moifiening nature. But, \..vhen the confiitution is
contrnry, they are \Veaker, by reafon of the tcmperan1ent and n1ixture of
.contrariery, affeCted by the heating ll:Jrs in cold confiitutions, and by
the n1oifi in dry. In the fame rnnnner each of the other confiitutions
have po\ver, according to the proportions of their mixtures. 1"o thefe
we mny join the mutual properties of the twelve figns of the zodilc;
for their general ten)peratures are agreeable to the fcafo'ns fuhj!:ct to each
lign; .and chc::y obtain fon1e other qualities arifing fro1n their analogy to
the Sun, Moon, and fiars; and thefe confiderations of the agrcetnent or
difagreen1ent of the natures and mixtures of the various influences of the
ftars, figns, and parts of heaven, are of no fmall confequence in a!ltolo-
gical conten1plations.
I
. Of the t\\'elve figns, fome are termed tropics, fomc equinoctial, fome
£xed, and others bicorporal. -The tropics are t\VO; the firfi .from the
fnn1n1er folfiice, the thirty degrees of Cancer; and the other from the
,.vin ter folfiice, the thirty degrees of Capricorn. Thefe are called tro-
pics, becaufe, when ·rhe Sun is pofited in the.. beginning of thefe figns, he
turns back out of the courfe of latitude ot declination, to the contraries,
n1aking fummer by his entering into Cancer, and winter by his paifage
into Capricorn. 1·here are alfo t\vo of the figns equinoElial; one from
the vernal equinox, which is Aries; the other from the autumnal equi-
nox, \Vhich is Libra. '] heJe are fo termed, becaufe, \Vhenever the ~un
enters the beginning~ of them, he tnakes the dlys and nights equai all
the world over.

AN ILLUSTRATION
'
Again, fix of the twelve figns are named m~fculine and diurnal; and
lix fern inine and notlurna1. And becaufe the night is al'Nays next to
the day, and the fen1inine is joined to the mafculinc, they arc placed
one after another by turns.· The beginning is taken from Aries, be-
caufe the tn oifiure of the {pring is the beginning of the 'feafons; and
becaufe the 1nafculine virtue is predorninant, and the active power before
the pafl]ve; therefore the figns Aries and Libra are -cfteemed mafcu....
line and ,diurnal; for thefe defcribe the equinoctial circle; and the prime
mutation, and ftrongefl: motion of all, is caufed by thetn. The other
figns are alternately placed one after another in their proper order; and
fron1 the form and quality of them, feme are tern1ed four-footed, others
terrefirial; fome cornmanding, and others fruitful. And, to renew them
jn the mind 'of the reader, it n1ay not be in1proper to difiinguHh then1
here. Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aqu~ries, are
mafculine and co111mandi"n·g. 1~aurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn,
and Pifees, are feminine and·obeying. Aries, Taurus, Leo, Sagittarius,
and Capricorn, are four-footed. 'faurus, Virgo, and Capricorn, are
terreftrial. Cancer, ~corpio, and Pifces, are fruitful. Again, Aries.,
Cancer, Libra, and Capricon, are termed moveable. Taurus, Leo,
Scorpio, and Aqu~ries, fixed. Gemini, ..Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pifces~
conltnon. Aries, Taurus, and Gemini, vernal. Cancer, Leo, and
Virgo, efiival. Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius, autumnal. C.tpricorn,
Aquaries, and Pifces, hyemnal. Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, are hot,
dry, and fiery. Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn, are cold, dry~ and earthy.
Gemini, Libra, and Aquaries, are bot, moifr, and airy. Cancer, Scorpio,
Pifces, Gemini, and Leo, are moift and watery; and Virgo is barren.
No\v from_this difpofition and temperature of the 1igns, are brought ·
about the great ends and purpofes of nature, by means of the afpects and
pofitions of the planets configurated in them; and it is upon thefe
afpeCl:s and configurations that the art of prediCting is grounded, and
the events of futurity fought out and knovvn. Thefe afpects are of two
for.ts, or c]affes, viz. zodiacal and mundane. · The principal zodiacal
· afpetts are the fextile, quartile, trine, and oppofition ; and, .though the
conjunCtion cannot properly be termed an afpeEt, yet it may come un-
der the more general name of a familiarity, common to all the afpect:s.
The conj untlion is formed by two planets being bodily joined, or meet..
ing in the fa1ne degree and nlinute of a fign. 1·he fextile is forcned by ·
two planets when they are two figns, or fixty degrees, afunder; the
quarule, when three figns, or ninety degrees, afunder; the trine, \Vhen
four figns, or one hundred and twenty degrees, afunder; and the oppo..
fition., when fix figns, or one hundred and eighty degrees, afunder;
which

which, being jufi one hnlf of the great circle, places the planets cx:tElly
fncing one another. 'fhe leffer or inferior zodiacal afpeets arc the
femiquadratc of forty-five degrees; the quintile. of {eventy-t\VO degrees;
the fefquiquadrate, of one hundred and ihirty-five degrees; and the
biquintile, of one hundred and forty-four degrees. And thefe arc either
partil~ or platic; p~utile, when the conjunction or afpeCJ; ,is made in
tJhe f~rne degree and n1inute, and platic \vhen not configurlted in the ..
!an1e degree and minute, but only within the orbs of' the afpeaing pla-
l)et. Moreover, thefe afpeCts are either dexter or finiller; dexter \vhen
· c9ntrary to 'the fuccefiion of the figns, as a planet.in Leo cafis a fextile
dexter to .
apothcr planet in Taurus. Sinill:er afpeCls are a.ccording to
the fucceffion of the .figns; agreeable to which, a planet in Aries cafis.
his trine finifrer to another in Leo; or one in Leo cafis a trine finifier
to another in Sagittarius. ,. · · ·
Mundane afped:s are thofe which are made in the meridional circlo
in reference to the ~arth, and confift of only the fextile, quartile, , trine,
and oppofition; though there are other familiarities which we call pa-
rallels, and thefe both mundane arid zodi.acal. Of thefe familiarities,_
the conjunCl:ion is good \Vith benevolent fl:ars; but, with tnalevolent; bad.
The quintile, biquintile, fextile, and trine, are alfo good and fortunate 1
but the femiq~adrate, fefquiqu~drate, quartile, and oppofition, are evil
nnd unfortunate. ~rhefe good and evil infillences proceed more from the
nature ,an~ quality of the ftars than from the nature of the figns they
po1fefs; for it is found that even good afpeRs of malefic planets \vill pro-
duce mifchief, though not in fo great a degree as the evil configurations.
'
ZC?diacal Parallels are what are cornmonly called Antifcians, and ar•
nothing more tha~ parallels of declination, or two points in the hea-
vens at equal dHl:ances from the beginning of any of the tropics, or
equinoC1ial points. · For example; one· planet in ten degree of Aries,
and ano~her in t\venty degrees of Pifces, are in zodiacal parallel to each
other; or, in <;>thee words, one planet in twenty·degrees of Pifces calls
its antifci~an, or one parallel, to ~~n degrees of Aries, and its coptra-anti-
fcian, or another parallel, to ten degre~s ·of Libra. Bu~, in taking the{e,
parti.cul~r a~tention n1uft be had to each'of ·i~e planets' latitude, for \\'ant
of \VQich, great errors have been, frequently made. For fuppofe the
Mool) to be pofited in twenty-two degrees of Taurus, with five degrees
of nor~h l~t_itud.c, h~r,antifci~n, ·or zodiacal parallel, taken in the com;
rnon \vay, would fall fn eigl1t degrees of Leo, and her contra-antifcian
in eight degrees of· Aql;laries; wher~as the. true antifcian falls in ten
degree~- of·~an~er, (\vhicb ~s no Tets t\la__n·jwenty~ei'ght degrees from ~hat

obtained in the common way, for there ~ is exaaly that difrerence be..
tween the ecliptical longitude of 1
twe'nty-two degrees of Taurus, with-
out latitude~ and twenty~two degrees of Taurus, with· five degrees of
north latitude.. · ·
A planet-thus c·onfidered, as having latitude, hath four zodiacal paral-
lels; one at its body, one at its antifcional point, and the other·two at
their oppofite points. And hence, according to~ the example above
ftated, the. Moon's parallels at her body fall i_
n twenty ·deg'rees ·· of Ge-·
mini, and at the antifcional point in ten oegrees of Cancer·; (and their ·
opp~fite points or contra-at?t~fcians, fall in twenty degre.es ·of Sagitta..
rius, and in ten degrees of Capricorn. Thefe nntifcians; and contra....
antifcians, are always of a benign and friendly nature, - when formed by
the benefic planets; t. but they are equally unbenign and unfortunate;
when made by violent and malevolent ftars. -
~
As zodiacal parallels are only equal diftances from the t_
ropical and
equinoCtial circles; fo Mundane Parallels, by a parity of reafon, are~ no-·
thing n1ore than a like equal ·difiance from the horizontal or meridional
points or circles. For exan1ple, a planet ·on· the ctifp, of the •t\velfth
houfe is in parallel to the cufp of the fecond houfe, becaufe it is exaBly
at the fame difl:ance fron1 the afcendant or horifon that the t\velfth is;
and likewife in. parallel to the eighth houfe, as being exaB:ly the fame
diilance from the tenth houfe or aneridian that the twelfth. is. And, as
the zod_iacal parallels are .. meafured by the circle of the zodiac, fo the ·
1i1undane parallels are meafured by the diurnal or ·noRurnal arches·;· for
jufi: fo long .as the Sun or any other pl~net \Vill be in proceeding from
~he cufp of the t\\~elfth houfe to the cu(p of the tenth, juft fo long the
fame Sun or other planets will be in proceeding, on the 'fame day, from
the cufp of the tenth to the cufp of·the eighth houfe; and j uft fo·many
hours and minutes of tin1e as there ar·e between the fun-rifing and noon,
jufi. (o tnany ho':JrS and minut~s are there, the fame day, between noon and
fun-fetting; hence the di~ance between the Sun's rifing and fetting· is no-
thing but the diurnal arch, which the meridian, or Sun's place at noon,
cuts into two equal parts; and,the diftance between the Sun~s··fetting and
rifing conftitutes the nocturnal arch. ~~hefe tnundane· parallel.s have a
t \Vo-fold confideration in direCtions;~ firft fi~ple, and according· to natural
order; and fecondly, according·to the rapt·motion of the ea~th, ··qr primum

at all partake of the afptCls, either by oppofition, trine, quartile, or
fextile. Hence rhey are tern1ed injut1; for, being configuratcd by one
fign's difiance, ·they arc as it \Vere difiortcd from each other ; and thofe
which behold by five .figns divide the \Vhole circle of the zodiac into
unequal parts. 1·he figns under this dcfcription, are Aries, Gemini,
Libra, and Sagittarius, \vhich have no faaniliarity or afpeC1s with T aurus ·
or Scorpio; and the figns, Cancer, Virgo, Capricorn, and P ifccs, have
no familiarity \vith Leo or Aquaries.
But the planets have familiarity \vith all parts of the zodiac by
- Houfes, Trigons, Exaltations; and Terms. Cancer and Leo, approaching
ne~rer. to our vertical point than either of the others, and thereby pro-
ducing heat and \Varmth, arc for that reafon defined to be the houfes of
the two great and prin1ary lucnin~ries : J..,eo is at~ributed to the Sun .as
mafculine, and ·Cancer .to the Moon, as feminine. Hence the femi-
circle of the zodiac fro1n Leo to Capricorn ...is . termed folar, and from1
Aquaries to Cancer lunar, in order that each p1anet ihould. p'ofTe[s one
fign for its houfe in each of its femicircles,; the one bearing configuration

The familiarities by triplicity are next to be confidered hy calculators
of ·nativities ; for, whereas· a trip1icity and figure of equal .fi~es obtain
an agreement, fa the circle of the zodiac is circun1fcribe"d by three
circles-, the equinoctial and ~ tl)e ~w.o tropics, and is divided into fqur
equilateral triangles, whi~h cp_nlli.tute thef~ triplicities• . 'Jhe fi.rfr is
formed by the three ll)af~uline · ~gns, Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius ; and
it has for it lords, the Sun, Jupiter, and Mars; but~ Mars beiqg of a
contrary nature to the folar influence, he is e~cluded · from bearing ·any·
govern~ent in this triplicity, and. therefore the .Sun has the rule.... by ,
day, and Jupiter by night. Aries 09cupies the equinoCtial -circle, Leo
the efiival, and Sagittarius 'the \vinter.. This Trigon is principally
northern, by r~afon of the do~i:nion of Jupiter; ;lnd i~ is wi1}dy and
fruitful. It is alfo north-\veft, and receives a n1ixture of the north-·
'veft winds, 'becaufe it;is#the houfe of Mars, \Vhich' planet il.irs up and .
governs thofe winds. · t, • • . •

The .fecond . tripli~ity, which confifts of Taurus, Virgo, and Capri-
corn, is under the government of the Moon and · Ven~s. rhe Moon
governs by night, and Venus .by day. Taurus is in th.e eftival circle,
Virgo in the equinoCtial,.and Capricorn in the· \Vipter. This triplicity,
becaufe of the donlinion of.Venus, is fouth; for this ftar being endue<:\
with. a warn1ing a1,1,d moifiening power, produces fouth \\'inds; and be-
ca~fe ~aturn has his houfe in Capricorn_. -in this triplicity, it li~e..\lvife

equinottin1. This triplicity ia \veftern, becau(e of the dominion of Mars
nnd the Moon; but, ntTuming a mixture by the rule: of Venus, it becomes
in fome meafure fauth-vvcfi.
The fumiliarities by cx:lltation are thus occafioned ; the Sun, when
he enters Aries, makes his tranfi t into the high and northern ft:micircle;.
but, \Vhcn he enters Libra, he patTes into the lo\v and fouthern femicir-
clc. For this rcafon, the Sun has his exaltation in Aries, in which the
days begin to lengthen, and the heating nature of the Sun begins to in-
creafe; and for the contrary reafon he receives his fall in Libra. Saturn,
being of an oppofite nature to the Sun, has an exaltation in I.~ibra, and
his fall in Aries; for, \vherefocver heat is increafcd, cold is dirninilhed 7
nod, \vhere there is an augmentation of cold, heat is leffened. So the
Moon, hecaufe lhe n1akes her conjunCtion with the Sun in Aries, and
rnakes the beginning of the increa{e of her light in the firfi: fign of her
triplicity; \vhich i~ Taurus, that is affigned for her exaltation. So Ju-
piter, the producer of northern and fruitful winds, when in Cancer, be-
comes more northerly, and acquires a greater increafe of po\ver; he
therefore takes C:1ncer for his exaltation, and Capricorn for his fall. And
fince Mars is chiefly of a burning nature, and becomes moft heating in
Capricorn, bccaufe he is then in his mofi fouthern declination, he hath
his exaltation in Capricorn, oppofite to that of Jupiter, and his fall in
Cancer. Again,, Venus is naturally n1oifiening, but n1ofily fo \vhen in
Pifces; for which reafon lhe afiun1es her exaltation in that fign, and
takes her fall in Virgo. But l\1ercury being of an opp.ofite nature, and
tnofily dry, takes the oppofite fign Virgo for his exaltation ; for theo
autumn, the drieft part of the feafon, appears; and he has his fall in the
ftgn Pifces.
Familiarities by terms have been already largely explained in the
former part of this vvork. But it is necefl~uy to ren1ark, that the be-
gi.nning of the figns, and of the terms alto, ought to be made from the
beginning of the equinoclial and tropical :figns; and this is manifeft, be-
caufe we fee their natures, and powers, and familiarities, have not any
other caufe, but from the tropics and equinoxes; for, if ·other begin-
nings are appointed, ~ve !hall either be neceffitated to ufe the nature of
the figns no longer in the theory of judgments, or, if we do adanit them.
,ve (ball commit error by corrupting the diftances~ and dividing thofe
from which influcnces are afforded them.
•
Befides thefe familiarities of the ftars and figns, they alfo polfefs what
are called their faces, thrones, and the like. Their proper face is when

each frar keeps the fame figure with the Sun and Moon \vhich its houfe
bears to th.eir . houfes. 1'his .is done when \'enus makes a fexangular
figure to the luminaries; and to .the Sun \vhen ihe is occidentalJ and to
the Moon when orienta], according to the fucceffion of houfes. They
.are alfo faid t6 be in their thrones, when they have a pov1er in the place
· .they po1fefs, according to the. foregoing prerogatives, by two o.r more
~ ·tefi:imonies; for then their energy and influences are increated, becanfe
the familiarity of the ambientt'Yelve figns co-operates there~7ith. They
-are likewife faid to be in their joy, \vhen, although they have no fami-
liarity with· the ambient figns, yet are fa in refpeCl: to others of the fame -
·.Condition with them, and by which likenefs there is found a comrnuni-
.cation .by fympathy. So ~gain, \vlfen they arc found of an unlike and
_
contrary conaition, much of their po\ver is diminilhed by a new and
mixed virtue arifing from the different ternperature of the ambient figns.
Hence let it be..llnderftood, that, when Mercury is one fign diftant frotn
· .the Sun, he is in his ~ace ; Venus, \V hen two figns diftant ; Jupiter,
)Vben fpur figns difiaot; and Saturn, \vben five figns from the Sun.-
'Jhe fame obfervation .holds good in refpeCt of the Moon, but then the
rule muft be made in figns antecedent to her; as, if the Moon were in
Virgo, then Mercury would be fo· dignified in Leo, Venus in Cancer,
,l\1ars in Gemini, &;c. ~ The thrones of the planets are thefe: Saturn's
throne is in Aquaries; Jupiter's in Sagittarius; Mars's in Scorpio; the
Sun's in Leo.; V~nqs's in 'faurus; Mercury's in Virgo;. and the Moon'i
in .Cancer. ~

The familiarities, by application and feparation, are likewife to be con-
Jidered iQ . the DoCl:rine of N:a.tivities. Thofe planets which precede
apply to thofe which fol!ow; and they that follow feparate frotn thofe
which precede. Thefe appllcations and feparations are like\\'ife to be
confidered with refpe~ to their latitude; for 'the_fmaller the latitude of
planets in ~onjunetiori is, the nlore powerful will be their influence;
pod, if two planets in conj ~netion have confiderable latitude of different
deno.minations, their influence will be thereby n1uch le.lfened. This
ob(~rv~tion likewife holds good in directions; for, the nearer any pla-
net is· to the ecli_
ptic line, the greater will his influence be. Moreover,
their ~ffeas are either firong or weak, in refpeet of the horizon; for,
when they are.pofited in the mid-heaven, or pafs into the place fucce-
dent to the mid-heaven, they are very firong and powerful ; the fame
alto if they are in the horizon 'hfelf, or in any of the fuccedent houfes.,
and more particular1y when in oriental parts. But, when they are in the
.·jmum c~li, ·or otherwife pofited. under the earth, their influence is very
w.~ak, ,an_
d of but little t'ffeet. · \

OF ASTROLOGY·
.
From n\1 the foregoing confidcrations, it is evident th:1t the efficient
power of the fiars is deduced from their peculiar and natural afpeets..
or proportional dillances, confidered in rcfpetl: of the Sun, the angles,
nnd the quality of the nmbicnt figns; and by the power and influence of
thefe afpeEls are all afirological {peculations governed. But ho\v thefc
afpeCts \Vere firll: difcovcred, and their virtues and proportions afcertained,
does no where appear; though it might be no diflicult tafk to accoWlt
for both upon philofophical and mathematical principles, fince nature
every \Vhere, as \ve11 in the tnotions and effetls of the heavenly bodies
as in all other arithmetical and geometrical rcfpetls, particular)y celc-
br~aes thofe proportions above all others. Picus, fpeaking of the a(petts,
thinks mankind were Jed to the kno\vledge of them by obfcrving the
different phafes of the Moon; for, when !he is new, horned, in her
quarters, gibboffity, or at full, her forms are llill changed at thefe
proportioned diftances from the Sun; belides which, it is to be obferved,
that in her annual revolutions the is con!l:antly found about ~he trine of
her O\Vn place in the beginning of the former year.
Other nfironomers, _of eftabliihed reputation, have like\vife obferved,
that nature particularly points to every configuration, while \Ve confider
the motions of the other planets. Abohazer judicioufly affirms that
the two inferior planets, in their ftations, defcribe the arch proper to a
quartile afpeB:; and Pliny alfo recommends to our obfervation the trine
afpeets, confl:antJy fanned by the fiations of three fuperior planets.
But, above all, it cannot be confidered without great adn1iration, ho\v
\vonderf~lly nature hath nobilitated aU the afpects in the motions of
Saturn and Jupiter. For as their conjunCtions are rare, and happen but
once in twenty years, fo hath nature evermore difpofed thefe conjunc-
tions in the moil: remarkable parts of the zodiac, ~bat is, in fuch figns
only as behold each other in an equilateral triangle infcribed. For, be-
tween any two great conjunCtions of Saturn and Jupiter, there are nine-
teen Egyptian years, three hundred and eighteen days, ·and thirteen
hours, in \\'hich fpace of tin1e thofe planets are moved fr.om the plac~
of their former conjunctions eight figns. and almofi three degrees; which
excefs of three degrees is the caufe why, after ten conjunCtions, they pafs
from one triplicity to another, and one triplicity continues one hundred
ninety-eight equal years, t\VO hundred and fixty-fivedays, {the intercalary
day of every fourth year omitted,) and ten hours. But the revolution'of
all the triplicities is fini!hed only once in {even hundred ninety-four
equal years, three hundred thirty-one dnys, and fixteen hours ; or other-
wife in fcven hundred ninety-four Julian years, one hundred thirty-
three days, and fixteen hours; \vhich, being doubled, amounts to one

thoufand five hundred and eighty-eight, which nu~mber of years thofe
.. authors are thought to h~ve refpetl:ed who cohudered the.year isSS from
the birth of Chrift '\Vould prove fo fatal.
,
.
From hence therefore it is, ana not without fufficient caufe, that
they are ter.med great. conjunCtions, both happening ra~e]y, and abiding
in pne triplicity ~lmoft two hundred years together, and not compleat-
ing all the triplicities of the zodiac in much lefs than. eight hundred
years: confequently they have not yet gone through all the.triplicities
eight times fince the beginning of t_
he world. Neither .are tbe other
afpecrs formed by thefe planets to pafs unnoticed ; for whoever obferves
wnen Saturn ~nd Jupiter behold ,each other by an oppofition or quartile
afpect, they will evidently perceive that they ftill carry fuch a regard
to the fign~ or plac~s of their preceding and next conjunctions~ as ever
more to irradiate the one and the other with an oppofition, fextile,
quartile,. or trine afpetl:; which I think is a fufficient proof that nature
hath allured us to the confideration. of the archs formed by ihefe ·afpeas
in the particular motion ot each.refpeetive planet•
.
To c_onfirni the virtue's and efftet~ of "thefe afpeas. we need only con-
fider what phyficians are taught by experience, nan)ely, that the crifis
of all acute difeafes has a palpable and extraordinary fympathy with
all thefc five configurations of the Moon, made to her place at the be-
ginning of the difeafe. Or, as a further proof, '~e need only refer to
whar has already been faid relative to the tides, which conftant.Iy:
obferve the motions. of the Moon, their fpring and higheft floods al-
ways concurring 'with 'their conJuntlion and oppofition to_the Sun, as
the neaps and loweft tides always do to her quarters. And it is
equally remarkable that the feas, in their daily ebbing and flowing upon
every coafi:, ha~e refpeet only to fuch azimuthal circles, as are in a
qua'rtile pofiiion when the Moon pafles 'by them. Again, the Sun moil:
evidently manifefi:s great effeCts by the quarti]e afpet.t~ fince he modi-
fies and governs t~e viciffituoes of feafo'ns, or four qu·arters of the
year~ by his ingrefs into the four equinoCtial and tropicar points of the
zodiac. .. ~ .
Th·e po-vver of thefe afpeCl:s is -not injudicioufly fta~ed by Julius
Firmicus, in the arithmetical obfervation which he makes of the num-
ber of figns agreeable to the afpeds, I, 2, 3, 4, 6, anfwering in pro-
greffiv_
e order to the conjunction, fextile, quartile, trine, and oppofi-
tion; for thefe numbers only, and no others, \Vill divide the zodiac,

,lliqi1ot parts of a circle. Ptolen1y alfo added not a little to the dignity
of t hcfe irradiations. \Vhen he firil: difcovcrcd the geometrical propor-
tion \vhich the fuhtenfes of each of rhcfc; arches bear in refpect to lhc
dian1ctcr of a circle. Others again, '"ith no lcfs ingenuity, have· oh-
1crvcd, that a1nongfi all regular or ordinate figures that n1ay be infcribcd
in a circlc_, though the fi1n1e be infinite, there arc none \V hofc fides and
angles carry a\vay the prerogative at the circumference and centre, but
thofe \vhofc fides and angles are anf\vcrablc to the fubtenfcs and arches '
.of their afpeels. For amongO: nll ordinate planes that tnay be infcrihcd,
there arc no two \Vhofe fides joined together have pre-eminence to oc-
cupy a ictnicirclc, except the hexagon, quadrate, and equilatc;raJ triangle,
ani\vering to the fexti1e, quartile, and trine irradjated. ·rhe fuhtenfe
therefore of a fextilc afped confill:s of t\vo figns, and joined to the fub-
tenic of a trine, compofcd of four, being regular and equilatcral, take
up fix figns, which is a complete fernicircle. In like manner, the fides
of a quadrate infcribed, fubtending three figns, and t\vice reckoned, alfo
occupy· the rnoiety of a circle. And \vhat the foregoing figures are fitid
to perfoqn, either doubled or joine~ together, n1ay alfo be found in
the afpect of oppofition; for the diametrical line \vhich paffes from the
place of conjunCtion to the oppofite point, divides a circle into tv~·o
equal parts, a circurnftance which cannot be found in any other infcripts.
For e.xampl~, the fide of a regular pentagon fubtends fevenry-two de-
grees; of an oCtagon but forty-five; the remainders ofwhich arches, viz.
o~c hundred and eight, and one hundred ancJ thirty-five, degrees, are not
.fubtended by the fides of any ordinate figure.
•
And thus, as the fubtenfes of thefe afped:s are the £1n1e 'vvith the fides
of the foregoing infcripts, and only take up the circumference of a
circle ; fo it is evident, that the angles at \Vhich they concur, are the
fame \vhcre\vith the ordinate planes take up the \vhole fpace about the
centre. For if \Ve confider the angle of a fextile afpeCt at the earth, it
is aJl the fatne with that of an equilateral trjanglc confi!l:ing of ftxty
degrees, and contains t\vo-thirds of a right angle; but fix tin1es t\VO-
thirds of a right angle make four right angles ; \vherefore fix f~xtiles, .
cqu~l to fix equilateral triangles, fill the \Vholc fpace about a point,
which is equal to four right angles. Secondly, every angle of a
quartile is a right angle, and the fan1e \Vith the angle of a reda~gle
quadrilater figure, four of \Vhich fill.a whole fpace. Thirdly, the angle
which t\VO fiars in a trine make at the centre of the earth, is meafured
by an angle of one hundred and t\venty degrees, \vhich is equal to. the
4ngle of a regular hexagon, confifting of a rjght angle and one-th1rd;
and, taken three times, tnakes fou.r .right nngles; \Vherefore three equila-

'vill fall .fhort of four right angles h,y t\vo-fifths of a right angle; \vhiHl:
on the other hand, four fuch angles , \vill exceed four right angles by

· 'J'~·efe fpeculations therefore duly confidered, it' wer~ fenfelefs ·to ima-
gine that natnre hath fo many '\Vays diftingui!hed thefe remarkable' irra- _
diations o( the ftars in· vain, or adn1onifhed us·to a particular regard of·
them, by fo many rare and fecref operations, as well in t~e motion of
the planets; as ii1 their effects and proportions, if they ·\vere not endued
with tnore (orce and virtue than any of the others. Hence it has giv~n
fcope to the ingenuity and abilities of the learned to affign a caufe, \vhy
thefe few configurations, above all \the others, ihould be endued \vith
fuch extraordinary efficacy. Nor has any reafon yet been given: ·'\vith
more apparent probability, than that· thefe ·proportions, whereof the
afpetls are found to confift, are precifely the fatne with thof~ which are
found in harmon~~al concords; for vvhich reafon it is fuppofed no lefs
probable, that the rays of the ftars in,thefe proportioned diftances, fhould
po\yerfully affeet the tnatter of aU fublunary things, by the £'1me rule
that the like geometrical fymmetry in founds and voices 1hould frir up
the fenfe and paffions of the hearer. And it is an eftabli!hed. obfervation
throughout the produClions of nature, that \Vhere due proportion is ·
not wanting, there f!le never fails to endue a11 her effetl:s \Vith fuch an
height of perfeCtion, as cannot but firike the fenfe and underfianding of
every ·obferver. ,. And thus it is even in artificial cotnpo(ltions, and ,in
medicines ; for '\ve know •tho'fe only to be · moft kind and' fovereign,
\vhich obferve a ·competent fymrnetry or temper~tture of the active and
paffive qualities. W-ith great propriety, therefore, and -vvith every ap:.
pearance of truth, .moft of the· learned agree ..with Ptoloiny, tt1at the
caufe of this \vonderful efficacy in the foregoing afpeas proceeds in a
great meafurc from harmonical4
proportion. · · ·

But more clearly to demonftrate this fin1ilitude or affinity bet\veen
the proportio~s of the ~fpeets and the' like diftances obferved in mufical

3gain, becnufc I m,1y hereafter allude to it, when I cotnc to fpcak of the ..
ne\V afpects. What I h~ve already faid, will fufficc to fhew the phild·
iophical fpcculution of thofe \Vho have afcribed the cfficjty of the pl:\-
n.ctary itratliations td the harmonica) proportidns \Vhich arc found bet \Veen
them. And fin~c it is obvious that thcfe afpcets do really b'car the fJnl~
.ri1utual i·efpcet. one to\vards another, rts a11 harmonica! coqcords ate
found to retain an1ung thcmfclvcs, \vhat tcafon can be ailigned, \vhf
nature,s operations in the lights and influences of the heavenly bodies
lhould not be governed by this fymtnetry of proportion, in the fiune
- .. rnanncr as \\'e find to be univerfally admitted in the fcience of mufic? -
But all this rather ferves to illuflrate a fi~11e, and to prove that qature
has indeed difiinguifhed the'fe proportions \\'ith extraordinary virtues
above any other, than to fatisfy the mind why, in the infinite variety of
founds and lights, thefc proportions only !hou1d correfpond fo fweetly
in. mufic, . and be mofi effecbial in the operations of nature. l(epler.
\Vith a fhe\v of plaufibility, has endeavoured to demonftrate, that God, in
the creation of the \vorld, ob{erved the fame proportion in the tnagni-
tude and diftance of the celeflial fpheres, tl!at is found in the regulat
fo1ids · \vhich in, geometry have their origin from the ordinate planes;
and therefore concludes, that the motions of the- heavenly bodies cor-
refpond mofl: f\VCet)y, and Co-operate ITIOft p0\VerfuJ1J together, \Vhen
the nature of fublunary things, endued, as he fuppofes, \Vith a fenfitive
faculty, apprehends and receives the beams of the fiars by their con-
currence nt , the centre of the earth j \Vhich anf\\·ers to the ordinate
planes, from whence the regitlarity of thefe proportjons is derived, as
the impre!Ted charaCters of that admirable fymmetry which God is faid
to _have obferved in the creation of the \vorld. And hence he fuppofes
that, as often as any earthly fubfiance meets with thefe proportions, it is
affected as it were by this idea, and exercifed in fuch a tnanner, that
'\Vhat it but ordinarily performs at other times, it \Vill no\v pro.ducc
'vith n1uch n1ore effeCl:. Not that thefe proportions \York any thing of
then1felves; for in mufic, it is neither the.~founds, nor the proportion
of t~~ concords, th,n \Vork any ·thing of themfelves, or beget any de-
light in the hearer ; but the foul, approaching to the organs of fenfc,
there firfl: entertains the founds in\vardly, then regards their proportions·.
and, finding the fame good and geon1ctrica1, lafily exhilarates itfelf, and
moves the body \Vherein it is, as \Vith an objed wherein it takes de-
]ight. Such alfo is the fyn1pathy bet\veen the heayen1y influences, and

fuch are the arches, Jubtenfes, and angles, of thefe irradiati_

I have hitherto only fpoken of what are termed o1d configuration::,
'vhich arc indifputably the moft excellent ; but I fl1ail now mention
'vhat are called the ne\V ones, as introduced by the ingenious Kepler,
namely, the quintile, confifiing of fevcnty-t \VO degrees; the biyui1:t:le,
of one hundred and forty..four degrees; and the Jefituiquadrnte, of one
hundred and thirty-five degrees; which afpects being added to die for-
n1cr, make eight configurations, anfwcring ~o the eight confonant fiops
in a monochord. 'fhefe new additions are by no means in,proper]y.
made, fince many cn1inent practitionc~s of this fcience have experienced
their utility in [peculations on the \Vcather and meteors, as· \Vell as in
bringing up the accidents of a nativity. Neither is there any \Vant C?f
philofophical or.mathematical demonfirations to fupport them ; for as in
mufic there arc but three perfeCl: concords, namely, the diapafon, diapente,
and.diritefiaron; fo in afirology there are but three perfect afpcds anfwer-
ablc to them, viz. the oppofition, the trine, and the quartile; the fextile
l1aving already been proved ap imperfect afpeet, anf\vering ·exaClJy to B
flat, the firft an1ong the itnperfeet and cotnpounded concords. \Vhere-
fore, confidering that the firft three perfect concords are found to have
their·perfeet afpetl:s anf\verable unto them, and that B flat, being an im-
perfect concord, is alfo found to agree exactly in proportion \vith the
fexti1e, being an jn1perfcet afpect, this undoubtedly gave Kepler fuffici-
ent reafon to conceive that the other harmonica! proportions contained in
the t~une monochord might alfo have their afpeCts, namely, the quin-

refpond ·\vitli the·m, and are in a fimilar degree effeCtual in their mode of
pperation. ' ~
.
1'hus having explained what the -
afpcct!. or configurations of the pla-
nets' really are, and proved that their power and infiu~nces are grounded
\lpon ·philofophical and matlJematical principles, I fh~ll .now proceed to
fbe\v their applications in' the ilfues of bun1:tn life, from conception to-
the.grave. ,

' f
It is, I 'believe, univerfally admitted, that tl;e beginning ,of human
g'eneration ta.kes place at t~e tin1e of conception; and therefore we ought
to be exact in afcertaining this time, and -in confidering the effeCl:ive
power"" of the configurations of the fiars, _as' they then happen... fo.. be
pouted, and from thence cont-en1plate the qualities of the mind and body.
For in the beginning, although the feed at once affumcs a quality by the
cotnniunication of the ~ circumambient matter, v:hich at other tin1es of
its forn1ation and.increafe becomes different; yet naturally, as it increafes,
it· retains its O..\vn proper matter, and is _rendered more like the peculiar
nature of the firft quaHty, \vith which it \Vas impre1Ted_at the time,_of
conception. . But if it be of fome importa!lce to know the tin1e of con-
ception, it is infiniJely more fo, to know ~he true time of birth; for by
the firfi, the accidents only before. birth are kno\vn ; but by the fecond,.
the incidents of our \vhole lives are to be difcovered. Wherefore one
may be called a beginning,_'and the other an afte~-beginning; . th'e firft,
the generatioD: of human feed; the fecond, that of man; · For in ,this
ftate the infant affumes many things which it had n·ot whet) in..the womb.
and thefe·peculiar to I hutnan nature alone, and the formation o±:,the body.
And although the properties of the celeftial and elen1entary ~ matter
feem to confer nothing at the time of birth; in refpetl: to the formation
of the child, yet it operates moil: forcibly upon it in other refpetl:s; for·
nature, after perfeCting the formation, difpofes ·the enfuing -e£I:ed: . ac-
cording to the ftate of the former at. the beginning. HencG it is rea..-
f.onable, in thofe whofe time .of conception is unknown~ that the con-
figurations of the fiars formed at their birth fbould be fignificative; not
that it \Vholly contains an effective. p<:n.ver, but beca~fe it neceffarily hath~
a po\ver by nature fi~ilar to 'the effeCtive. But it is always·heft, if the
t\me of conception can be had, to compare it \Vith the time of birth;
for the time of conception fhe\v.s \Vhat {hall happen to the infant while
in the womb; "as \vhetber it iliall be firong or weak, firm or infirm, perfect
or imperfect, mal~ or female, fingle or twins; OJ;" \Vhether it ihal1 arrive to
the full and perfeCt time of birth. But the occurrences of life after birth.
are to be confidered from.the pofition of the heavens at the birth..only.

No\V fince nothing can be prediCted ~ in allrology \vithout this funda-
nlental guide, namely, the ratfix,I or true Hrnc of birth, various n1c- ·
thods have been invented in diflcrcnt ages, for the purpo(e olafccrtain-
ing this point \Vith prccifion, after the cfiimatc or fuppQlCd time_is given.
And this is tertncd the rtflificatioll of.. lzntiviiiesl becaufe the [iines
uftlally noted dot\'n by parentS or mid\vivcs is-feltfom correct, either
thrbugh inattention, or from errors in clocks ; but b¥ thcfe rules the dif-
fcr~nce bet\vecn the efl:imatc or fuppofcd tinie, and the real, is difcovcrcd
and corre&ed. This reCtification is done by various \vays; firfi, by
the. ..rrutinc of I-Iermcs j fccondly, by: ihc Aqimoder of Ptolomy; and
thitdly, by accidents .of the native,s life, ~vhich is alfo fivefold; firft,
according to Argo!; fecondly, _
according to Kepler; thirdly, according to
Morinus; fourthly, by the luminaries ; and· fifthly, by a nc\~ and
n1ore correCt method.
By the Truti~e of 1-Iertnes, ereCl: ~he figure to the cO:in1ate time of

the afcendant, if !he. be under the earth ; or fron1 the. f<;venth houfe, if

adding thereto the three hundred and fixty d~grees of the zodiac, if fub-
traCl:ion cannot be tnadc \Vithout ; then \Vith the rentainder enter the fol-

if January or December, in the fourth column if in April or September,
or in. the fifth column if in March, May, June, July, Augufi, October,

or Novetnber, \Vill be found an equation of days to be addcq to, or

according to the letters A or S, at the

ne\v, then note the degree of the ftgn \Vherein either of th.e luminaries
\Vere pofitcd that were above the earth; but, if one of the luminaries be
exad:ly riling, ~nd the other fetfing, prefer that \vhich is riling. 'l'hcn
obferve which of the planets hath mofi dignities by triplicity, houfe, ex...
altation, term, or configuration, in the degree of fuch preceding ne\V

But on the contrary, if the planet be nearer the degree 'on the cufp of .

Ptolomy further obfcrves, that \vhat fign the Moon is in at the time

To rectify by accidents, according to the method of Argol, fet the

- ·Secondly, according. to .I<epler, gather a ~able. of the Sun,s place, for
eighty, ninety, or one hundred, days. tnore or lefs, immediately fucceed-
ing the day of birth; tp_
en having the tin1c of the accident, number fo

birth, making proportion for .the odd days, and find the Sun's place· at
that- time, with the right afcenfion thereof, which' fubtract from the

CQrreded; , \vhere note, that having fet the figure to the efiimate time.
calculate the Sun's place .thereto, and find the difference bet\veen that .

with that day..fignifying the number of years in which the accident
happened; but, if it beJefs, add; fo iliall the difference or fum be the

fo are the faid odd days to the odd min.utes, \vhich are to be added to the

luminaries' pole of polition exactly for its place in the cflimate figure,
under which pole direft the faid luminary to the faid probable promHfor,
and find the difference between that and the time of the accident
converted into nn arch of dircCl:ion; then make a fccond fuppofition
at the pole of pofition, working as before; and, noting the difference be-
t\veen the arches of the two directions, fi1y, As the difference of thefe two.
arches is to the diftcrcnce in the poles of pofition, fo is the firfi aforcfaid
difference to the difference between the firfi: fuppofed pole of ·pofition.
and the true pole of the luminary ptopofed ; but it is necelfary here,
that th~ efi:imate time be .given pretty exact. Thus, having found the ·
true polo of pofition, it gives the true oblique afcenfion or dcfccnfion o£
the luminaries,. \Vith its. diftancc from the meridian ; by \vnich may be.
found the medium creli correCt, and thereby the true tin1e of birth.
Betides thefe, there are feveral. ne\V methods. of rectifying nativities by
accidents. For inftance, fiftbly; fet the figure to the eftimate time, and·
draw a fpeculum thereto; in which, befides the afpetl:s of the planets,.

and ,for eve.ry year account one day in the Ephemeris, to the year
current in \vhich the accident happened ; find that promi!for's place:
{in that day adhering to the year current) for the efiimate time o£
birth; faying, As twenty-four hours is to the planet's diurnal motion,.
fo are -the hours and minutes elapfed fran\ noon to the minutes. to be·
added or fubtracted to or from the planet's P.lace at noon that day.; ac-
cording as the faid planet was either direct. or retrograde; then ]aftly, As•
three hundred and fixty-five days fix hours are to that promiffor,s diurnal
motion, fo is the number of days elapfed from the birth (at the tern1ination.
of which the accident fell out) to the n1inutes to be again added or fub-. ·
tracted to or from the aforeL'lid ·place.of the L'lid protniffor, as he \vas

afcendant or medium creli to fignify that accident, confider \vhat other·
fignificator, being directed to any likely pron1iffor, tnight effect the £1me ;.
and in the Ephemeris, againfi: that day lignifying the number of the~

dtiCl:ed out of the place of the aforefaid prorhiffor ; and N1e retnainder is
the exact place of th~ faid fighificator at the true tin1e of birth." In tllis
cafe it wi~l_be neceffary to have !he efiimate time~ very near; and that
the su·
n. Venijs, Mercury, or .the Moon; be fignlficators; and Saturn,
Jupiter, or Mars; or their ·afpeCls, pro~i!fors; ot~er\vife, i_f the 'more
weighty planets be :fignificators; take the dturnal mot1
6n of the promiffor,
and work .as before; fubdueting thefe minutes and fecond~ from the
fignificator, and ~he remainder is the exaCt- place of the pro1ni1Tor at the ~
trUe time-of birth. ·lf yet no direction appears · \vhich may fignify the
given accident, confider t~e Moon's directions on the right-hand page
of the Ephemeris, againfl: the ~ay fignifying the year current in \Vhich
the accident happenea; and, allo\ving two hours for a month, fubtrad: the
days elapfed from the birth..d'\y from the hours and minutes, adhering

But the !hortefr, eafieft, and mofr fi1nple, \vay of rectifying a nativity,
atid which includes all the perfections of· the foregoing, provided, the
efiimate time does nQt exceed t\VO hours of the real, is as follo,vs.-
Having erected the figure to the eftimaie time, obferve \Vhether either of
~he luminaries be pofited in the centre of any one bf the three prime
angles, namely·, the afcendant, medium cceli, o~ fe·venth houfe, or near
them; and if fo, bring either of them to the cufp of the angle, and the
degree and minute· they wer,e in is the true time of birth. But, if
neither of the1e are found thus centrically pofited, no~ near ~he cufp·s of
either of t~ofe angl~s, then bring them to a right parallel frotn angles,
and that will be the true time. If their pofitions will not .adn1it of
this, obferve the t\VO ben·efic pl}lnets Jupiter and Venus, and note
whether either of them be fituated as above·fpecined, namely' in tlle
centre ·of the angles, or in a right parallel \Vlth ·either of the lun1inaries,
that is to fay, with th~ Sun by day, or the Moon by night ; and either
of thefe brought to the cufp·s a's before, will give the true time ()f
birth. So likewife either of the malefic planets 'Saturn and Mars, if
found pouted in the centre of the angles, or ·near their cufps, or in
parallel to either of the luminaries as above, will be the prorogator of
life, .and like\vifJ fu•

but particularly \Vhen they occupy the cufps of the afcendant or mid-

are in occidental places, and flow, retrograde, and dimini!hing theil·
courfes; but \veak in refpett of tbe geniture, when they are in cadent
houfes, or falling from t~e angles, The general time of the event is
kno\vn from the{e ruling fiars being ori~ntally or o~cidenta11y . pofited in
refpeel: of the Sun and the horofcopc, and from their_being in the·angles
, or· fucceedcnt houfes ; for, when they are matutine or angular• they are
'luick; but, when occidental or vcfpertine, fio\V,
Thefe .things being premifcd, it follo\VS that the firfr conlideration
upon the face of a geniture is that 1
which relates to the parents of the na-
tive·. The Sun, therefore, and Saturn, reprefent the perfon of the father;
and the Moon and Venus that of the mother. And, as thcfe are found
afflicted among themfelves, or other\vife, fo we underfiand the accidents
appertaining to parents will be. The fiars that. are configurated with
the ·Iun1inaries fho\V what relates to their fortunes and polfeffions; for, if
they are furr~unded by the benefics, and by fuch as are of the f~une
nature, and in .the fame figns, or the fucceeding, their fortunes \vill be
illufirious and -fplendid; particularly if t,he Sun· be configuratcd \Vith
oriental fiars, or the Moon by occidental.. I£ Saturn and Venus be ori-
entally pofited,_
or angu1ar, they foreiho\V happinefs according to the par-
ticular circumfiances of each pa(eflt. If the luminaries are void of couife,-
and in no good afpetl: with the fortunate fl.ars, a low condition, or an
ignoble life, is prenoted. lltlt if the luminar-ies are varioufiy CO!lfigu-
rated with good and evil fiars, a mediocrity and.inequality in the fort~nes
of the parents is thereby detnonfrrated; as when Mars afcends to the
Sun·, or Saturn to the Moon, anci the benefics in different .conditions.
Again, if the Part of Fortune in the nativity is found in a good pofition,
\vith the ftars configurated \vith the Sun·and· ~loon, the affairs of the
parel)tS \Vill be profperous; but if it be difcordant, and fituatcd in a bad ·.i"
place of the figure, with 1nalefic fiars, their concerns \Vill turn out
injurious and unprofitable.
· The length and iliortnefs of life mufi be confidered from other. confi-
gurations. If Jupiter or Venus are any '\vay joined in afpeCl: with the Sun
or Saturn, or if Saturn hath an harmonizing configuration with the Sun,
that is, if they behold each other by a fextile or trine, and firongly dig-
nified in other refpeCl:s, they promife long life to the fathet. But if
tbefe pofitions are found \Veak, wit}:l Mars dignified above the Sun, ,and
&iturn in quartile or oppofitio.t:J, the father \V ill be· taken off in the early
part of_his life. 'I'~e diftinctions \vllich relate to the mother, are thefe.

· If Jupiter is configuratetl to the Moon or Venus; or Venus alone be-
holds the Moon by a fcxtile or trine afpca, the n1other \vill enjoy health
. and longevity. But, if l\1ars be pofited in any of thc·anguL\r or fuc-
ceedcnt houfcs, beholding the Moon or Venus \Vith a quartile or oppo'-
iition; or if Saturn is thus configurated with the Moon, flow in motion,
and dcclini.ng fron1 angles ; they induce the direct contrary effects, and
proclain1 a difcafed and fhort life to the 1nother. Thus from the nativity
of a child may the principal concerns of the father and n1other be fought
out; and· afccrtained;. nnd fuch is.the fympathy cxifting by this bond of
nature and confilnguinity, that little difierence \Vill be found, if cotnparcd
\\'ith the proper nativity of each parent.
But, to give judgment in fuch cafes \Vith corrcd-ncfs, feparatc fchcmes
nudl be cred_
ed for the father and motlier, by the follo\Ving rule.-ln
the figure erected for the father, if the nativity be qiurnal, note the
degree in \vhich the Sun is pofited 'in_ the <;hild's nativity, and make·
that the degree aicending upon the horofcope for the father; and con-
formable to that, order the cufps of all the other houfes, by the rules
heretofore laid down. If the figure be ereCl:cd for the mother. then
take the degree of Venus, infl:cad of the Sun, and proc~ed in all· othcr-
rcfpeets·the (tme. But if the nativity be notturnal, take the degree of
Saturn for the father, nnd that of the Moon for the n1other. And in
all thefe cafes it n1uft be obfervcd; that the nativity of the firfi-born js
to be preferred, then that of the fecond, and fo on. And that \Vhat-
ever is tJre·noted in re~ation to the parents from thefe figures, is only fuch
as !hall happen to them after the birth of the child, and not to any
thing before. 1"hc time in \vhich any or each-of thefe events \viii hap-
pen is to be fought out by the arches of direCl.ion, or diftances of that
ftar which hath the dominion, in rcfpect of the Sun, and the angles of
the \vorld; and this I fhall tnake perfectly eafy to the meaneft under--
fianding, \\'hen. I come to treat o~ d~red.ions in general.
Now the next confidcration in the native's geniture is the place of
brcth~cn; and this is taken from the fign on the mid-heave~), and· the
maternal place, \vhich is the pofitjon of_Venus by ,day, and the Moon by
night. For as this can only relate to children born of the fame n1othe~,
this fign, and that which fuccecds it, being maternal, naturally confti-
tute the place of brethren. 'rhis place, therefore, 'vhen configurated by
benevolent ftars, denotes plenty of brethren, becaufe the increafe of bro--
thers and fillers happens according to the multitude of fiars, and from
their being fituatcd in doubled-bodied figns. or in thofe of one form ;
but, if the_malefics have fuperiority in number or power, or are adve~;

by oppofitio'n, paucity of brethren \\"ill happen, particul~rly if unbe-
nign ft~rs circumfcribe the "Sun. If the co!1trariety of afpetl:s be in
angular houfes, efpecially in the afcendant, Saturn. ~ill procure thofe
that are firft nourifhed, and. firfr-born; and Mars will induce to fevv-
- riefs and de"
ath. Moreover, ·if. the fia~s which give brethren are \V ell
a~etl:ed according to mundane fituations, the general fortunes of the
brethren will be 'glorious·and famous j but mean ']nd obfcure if the con-
trary pofitions happen... If the rnalefics beJuperior in number and fl:rength
to the ftar~ \vhich give brethren, their conftitutions \Vill be puny, and
I
their lives iliort. · ~
And here alfo.we ~ay ·oQfcrve, that from the geniture of one bro-·
th~r' the principal incidents of the life ~f another.may be difcovered' by
confiituting the place of the given planet as an horofcope ; that is, the
planet \Vhich has principal rule in ·.the houfe of brethren, · whether by
day or night. ·rhe 'met~od is, to place this rupng planet, \vith the
farne degree he is found in, upon the afcendant, furuifhing the cufps of
all the other hou(es by this itan~ard, as before ftated in . the cafe of pa-
rents. It 1nuft however al,vays be remembered, that mafculine fiars
produce,tnales, and feminine females. Alfo, if the ftars \vhich denpte
brethren ·and that \Vhich has rule in the houfe of brethren agree by
any harmonious configuration, they will be aficeted to\vards each·other,
and live in friendfhip and concord; but, if thefe fiars are found in
contrary pofitions, and in fign? inconjunct, enmity and hat~ \Vill mark
their condtiCt to\vards each o'ther. · ·
'
'The foregoing fpecuhitions are deduced from an invefligation of the
pofition of the heavens at the tin1e -of birth ; .but, in order to kno\v
\Vhether the infant be male or female, during t~e fiate of pregnancy,
the time.. of conceptioi1 .only mufr be confidered. For this purpofe, we
rnufl: particularly obferve the poGtion of both the lum-
inaries in refpeCl:
to the horofcope, at the time of conception, together \Vith the fitua- ..
tions of all the fiars which have a regard to them-; and whether the
ruling finrs are confiituted of a mafculi.ne-or fen1inine nature. For ·the
production of males and females is according to the difiindion of n1af..
culine and feminine fiar~, \vhich I h~vc already fhewn proceeds from
the nature of the figns in }'Vhich they are pofited, an(l fron1 their mu..
tual and mundane refpea: ·; for, being oriental, .they-are mafculine; but.,
occidental, fetnin~nc. The fame like\vife in refpect to the Sun ; for,
being oriental, they are referred to the male ; and,· occidental, to the
female. Therefore thofe \vhich have the greatcft po\ver in thefe re~
fpeets at the time of conception, will give fufncient ground's to conjec-
ture at the fex of the infant for months before it is born.

So like\vife the fame confiderations hold good, in fon1e refpetls, cou-
cerning t\vins, or more ; for herein \VC are principally to regard the t\VO
lun1inarics nnd the afcendant. For it happens through the mixtures
\vhich arc occafioned \vhen they poffels bicorporal figns, or when the
ruling planets are fituated in them, and many prolific fiars call: their rays
to the fame, that it \viii be a p1ural conception. The nu1nber ·then
generated is known fron1 the fiar which induces the propriety .of the
nuntbcr; but the fex is detennined by the fiars configuratcd with the
Sun, 1\'Ioon, and horofcope. For· \VC find from obfervation, that, \Vhcn
both the 1un1inarics are in the mid-heaven, t\vins are procreated; \Vhen
Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, have configuration \vith the affigned places
in hicorporal figns, three males are generated ; but three felnales, \\'hen
Venus, Luna, and Mercury, are configurated in the fame manner. Saturn
Jupiter, and Venus, thus difpofed,.produce t\vo males and one fetnale; but
venus, Luna, and Mars, t\VO females and one male. Thefe configu-
rations but rarely happening at. the ti1ne of conception, render it a kind
of phenomenon \Vhenever they occur ; and hence we generally find the
births that follo\v in coufequence are ranked amongft the \Vonders of
the day in the public prints, though the caufe has.a radical foundation
in nature. And hence too it is, that, as thefe configurations are more or
lefs itnperfetl:ly made, fo will be the quality of the conception, either
bringing all into life uniform an~l perfetl at the birth, or elfe bringing
one \vith good conformation, and another \Vith puny, imperfect, or mon-
firitOtls, members.
There are alfo certain configurations of the frars, which abfolutely-pro-
duce moles or mon!l:ers, in every conception that takes place under
them. Thus it happens. when the lutninaries decline _from angles, and
fall cadent, \vithout·any kind of afpeCl: to the ·afcendant, and \V hen he
cardinal houfes are occupied by the malefic planets. But to defcribe
the fpecies of unnatural birth; it is necefl:1.ry, in thefe configut:ations, to
obferve the place of the lafr full Moon preceding the time of conception,
together \Vith the ruler thereof, and the lord of the huninaries ; for, if
the· places of thefe fignificators have no familiarity with the place of the
faid preceding full Moon, \Vhat is then generated \Viii be of unnatural
conformation. If the luminaries are at the fame time pofited in four-
footed ·iigns, and 'the t\vo malefic planets in angular houfes, \Vhat is
then conceived \vill_not be in hurnan !hape ; but if .Jupiter or Venus in-
terpofe their benevolent rays, and give tcfiitnony to the luminaries, then
\vhat is conceived \vill be of hun1nn conforn1ation, but of a fierce and
C1.vage nature. If l\1ercury corr.efponds 'vith the luminaries, the dif-
poiition \vill be agreeable to nature, but the form of the body 'vill be

.
unnatural; or if the luminaries be in human figns, and the ruling planet
difcordant, then the oftspring v.rill be of proper conformation, but mon-
frrous in quality. If one of the malefic fiars give tefiimony in any of
the foregoing pofitions, \vhat is ·then genera.ted will be irration~l, or of
ungovernable ·qualities; but, if Jupiter or Venus give tefiimony, the ·
ofFspring will naturally po!fefs the Lnental aedoinpliihinents, \vitb an her-
n1aphroditical conformation. If Mercury alone gives teftimony to the
aforeiaid pofitions of the lutninaries, that.. which is procreated 'vill be
deaf, ·and perhaps dumb, though intelleCl:ually \veil qualified, and in-
genious. Thefe.[peculations are doubtlefsly abfirufe, becaufe fuch con-
figurations feldom happen, and the refult of them is very little kno\vn;
but; to confinn their effect, I have only to recommend to thofe \v ho have
their doubts, to be guided by obfcrvation;and to decide by the refult; for
the more we enquire into the pathlefs \vays of nature, the 1nore readily
we deduce a radical caufc for all her produCtions.
But here I mufi: not omit to remark, that the ti1ne of conception, and
that only, is to be referred to for the confonnation or accidents of the
child in the \Vomb; and the time of birth for what fhall happen after; -
not\vithfianding there is always fuch a concurring agreen1ent bet\vc~n
the conception and ~ birth, that \V hatever is produced by the former is
in a great meaft1re to be difcovered frotn the latter, though not V{holly
correCt, or to be relied upon as infallible. 'rhofe, therefore, \:vho are
born in their natural .{hape, and after\vards become crippled and lame,
even t.o a 1nonitrofity~ yet, fince not brought into the \Vorld \vith the na-
tive, they fall und'er the defcription of bleinilhes, or bodily infirmities,
rather than the refult of monfrrous and unnatural confonnations.
·Di{l:inet from this fpecies of conception, is that which, though per-
fectly natural and \vell conformed, yet is void of fiamina, and hence ·
ten11ed au e1nbryo not nourijhed. This kind of conception 11appcns '\Vhen·
one of the luminaries, in an angular pofition, is joined with a malefic
ftar, and that luminary giver of life. So like\viie if the parallel of
longitnde bet\veen. the malefic planet and the luminary be partile, or
~1ccording to a figure of equal fides, and none of the fortunes c~rrefj)ond­
ino-; and at the 1ame time the lord of the lu~niuaries be poGted in a dif-
co~dant place, \Vhat is then generated cannot be nou·rifhed, but decays
in the womb, or expires ioon after the birth. Or if they are not equi-
1aterally configurated, but the t\:vo n1alcfic planets nearly irradiate the
places of the luminaries, afflicting both, or only one of them, no rnatter
,vbether the tnalefics be fuccedent or oppofite, fo one or both of thctn be
in parti1e configuration \\'ith the luminaries; for \vhatever is born under .

0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y. 433
fuch· influences \vill be of no duration, Gnce the greatncis of the pov.rer
of the n1alefics \vill deftroy \vhat !hould necc!Thrily conduce to the nou-
rilluncnt of life.
It is particularly to be obfcrvcd, that Mars affliCts the Sun by (uc-
cefiions, and Saturn the l\1oon; but by oppofitions the contrary hap-
pens; for in theie the Sun is affiicced by Saturn, and the Moon by Mars;
and this affiiclion is the tnorc eminent when the malefic fiars are fignifi-
cators, and by that tncans become f\1perior both to the luminaries and
the horofcopc. From thefc obfervations fubordinatc effeCts have been
afcertained: fo1· 'vhen there are t\vo oppofitions of the malefic ftars, and
the luminaries fituated in angles, \vhatevcr follo\VS that conception \vill
· be fl:ill-born. But if at this time the ltaninaries are feparating from the
benefic planets, or are in any.. other afpeet \vith them, cafling their
beams at that time in a converie diretl:ion, the fretus \Vill obtain anima-
tion, and be found alive and perfeCt: at the birth; but vvill live only fo
many months, days, or hours, as th~re are degrees, minutes, or feconds,
of the tolar motion, between the bean1s of the Apheta and the nearell:
malefic planet. But if the malefics call: their bean1s to the parts preceJ..
ing the luminaries, aild the benefics to the degrees follo\ving, '"'hat is
born will fuffer great afflictions, and il:ruggle much \Vith infirn1itics, but
thall recover and live.
..
And hence the confideration that naturaJly folio\\~ 1"egards the oura...
tion or fpace of life, \\'hich taking in the \Vholc cotnpais of human pur-
fuits, and the duration and viciffitudes of thetn, doubtlcfsly becomes the
moft in~erefiing part of the dotl:r.ine of the fiars. The mode.of afcer-
taining this important point, natnely, the fpace of duration of the na-
tive's life, is defined from a comparifon of the aphetic, hylegiacaJ, or
prorogatory, places, \Vith the killing or anaretical places in the genethliacal
figure at the titne of birth. The aphetic place is the tituation of the
A pheta, Hyleg, Prorogator, Significator, or giver of life, for they have
all the fame tneaning; and the anaretic place is the fituation of the
Anareta, or killing planet; and \vhen,ever thc{e ihall n1eet together, or
be conjoined in a bodily afpecr, the native \Villnncl a termination of life;
confcquently the length of titne, in \vhich the A pheta and Anareta,
as pofited in each refpectiYe figure of a nativity; '"ill be in forming a
Ct)njunCtion, or cotning together in the f:.nne point of the heavens, is the
prccife length of the native's life; apd this period is afcertained by \Vhat

them to the common meafure of time, fhall be copioufly explained
after we have taught the mode of afcertahling the particular occurrences
of the n~tive's life, from the face of the horofcope~ or genethliacal
figure.
.. Of the FORM and TEMP·
ERATURE of the BODY•
If the fpace'of life appears likely to exceed childhood, we are next to
confider and define the fhape and figure of the native's body, according
to the rules heretofore laid down. The parts of the body are formed
before the foul; and becaufe it is infinitely Inore grofs, hath a connate
and almoft apparent endo~'ment of temper. But the foul, not being
cotnmunicated to 'the body till the entire conformation the_
reof ~e wholly
perfected, 1nanifefts by degrees an aptitude proceeding frotn the firft
caufe, but 1nuch later than thofe of the external accidents; and therefore
it r~quires fon1e length of time before the nature and progrefs of this
mental aptitude can be known. As to the form and temperature of the
body, that is generally defcribed from the oriental horizon, and from
fuch of the planets as b'ear rule i9 it, or have the dominion thereof;
together \vith the particular and refpecrive configurations with the _
Moon; for according to the quality of thefe t\VO places, and the nature of
the ruling frars, the formative virtue, and the te1nperament in each fpe-
cies, with reference to the declination of the aicending fixed frars, is the
particular formation of bodies defined. ·
To what has been already faid, concerning the effetls of each planet
refpeetively, in giving fhape to fuch infants over \vhofe nativities they
prefide, \Ve muft like'vvife add the peculiar force and operative faculty of
the luniinaries, with which they may then happen to be configurated.-
If the Sun co-operates, it contributes much towards the produCtion of a
more comely ana majefric perfonage, and of a mild and good habit; and
the Moon, when fhe withholds her defluxion, caufes a more proporti-
onate, flender, and moifi, tetnperatnent; but varioufly, according to the
nature and qualities of her feveral quarters. Again, if the luminaries
correfpond \vith oriental rays, they add to comelinefs and frature; or, if
ftationary, they make the native firong ~nd robuft. But,. ,\vhen they
accidentally concur, difproportionate formations and evil temperameuts
are commonly the refult.
In this [peculation, the different effetl:s of the four quadrants are
likewife to be confidered; that from the vernal equinox to the fun1mer
, tropic
435
tropic gives the native an excellent con1plcxion, cotnc1y, of a good
finturc, abounding \Vith heat aud ·n1oifi~1 re. But the quadrant frotn the
fitmmcr tropic to the autun1nal equino:< gives but an indiflcrcnt conl·
plexion, though the body is ..\Veil proportioned, healthy, and \'igorous,
abounding \Vith heat and drinefs. "fhat from the aut\lmnal equinox to
the \Vinter tropic gives n f:'lnguine cotnp1exion, \V ith a {lender, ]can,
and fickly' habit, abounding 'vith driuefs and cold. rfhc quadrant from
the winter folft:ice to the fpring equinox gives a dark complexion, \'lith
a tnoderate fiature, fquarc and fl:rong, abounding \vith cold and moif-
ture. This is to be underfiood in reference to the fians afcc.nding, and
in \Vhich the l\1oon and other fignificators rcfpctlively hear rule. But
it is more p'\rticular1y to be obferved, that the figns \vhich arc of hu·
man form, both in the zodiac and without .it, tnake bodies of a moll:
excellent (ymtnctry and proportion; '"hile thoie \vhich arc not of hu-
nlan form aCt contrarhvife, deranging the . proper rules of proportion,
and influencing frotn the properties efiential to an elega~t fhapc to that ,
of difproportion and defonnity.

From a fin1ilaJ." hypothefis to the above, \Ve derive the obfervation of
external b1emilhes .and bodily difeafes, \Vith all the common accidents
of the hun1an fratne, to \Vhich the native is expofed during the coude of
his Jifc. The moil: approved mode of afcertaining and difringuifhing
thcfe is by regarding the eafrern and \V,efrern angles of the ~·orizon, but
particularly the \veHern, and· the part preceding, \vhich is the fixth
· houfe, for that is inconjtlnet with the oriental angle. Thefe angles
being properly taken, \Ve ihould next obferve thc.tnalefic fl:ars, and ho\v ·
they are configurated; for, if both or either 6f them are pofited ·upon the
afcending parts of the faid angles, either bodily or by quartile or oppo·
iition, there \Vill be external blemiil1es, or bodily infirmities, infc-
parable from the perfon then born. Or, if both the lurninaries, or only
one of. thetn, be angular, as above defcribed, either in conjunCtion or
·oppofition, \Vith a malefic ftar a1cending, they \vill · produce fuch infir-'

TtnpcdiLncnts or blemilhcs in the fpcech are found to arife from the
configurations , of Saturn and l\tlercury \Vith the Sun, in the aforefaid
angles; particularly \vhcn l\1ercury is pofitcd in the \vefi, and beholds
the l\1oon either by an oppofitiou or quartile afpctl. And, if thefc con-
ligurations happen to be made in mute figns, as in Cancer, Scorpio, or
Pitces, the impediment \viii prove confidcrably gr·eatcr. Again, if the
malefic flars arc pofited in angles, and the lun~inaries afcend to them
either by conjuntlion or oppofition; or if the malefics afcend to the
lutninaries, and.the ~1oon be in her node in hurtful figns, as Aries, Tau-
rus, Cancer, Scorpio, or Capricorn, the dcfeels of the body \Vill be by
lamenefs, gibbofity, difiortion, or luxation. If the malefic frars are in
conjunClion \V ith the luminaries, thefc affeCtions will take place from the
birth; but, if they are fituated in the. mid-heaven, elevated above the lu•
rninaries, or in oppofition to them, they will arife from the concurrence
of various accidents, fuch as falls,..blovvs, \Vounds,_and the like, during..
their progrefs through life.. ·
Blemiihes happen for tne mofF part \vhen tlie Moon· is in 'tropical or
equinoCtial· figns.' In the. vernal figns- they are chiefl}' occafioned by
1norphe\v ;· in the fummer, by tetters.;. in the. aututnn, by the {curvy; .
and,.. in the \vinter, by biles and other morbid eruptions.. But difeaies
tnoftly happen when the malefic fiars are configurated in the aforefaid
angles, but contrarily· as to the luminaries, viz. occidental.to the Sun,
and. o:riental to the. Moen.. In thefe pofitions Saturn induces to unufual
colduefs in the belly and. reins, and fubjeCls the native to phlegmatic hu-
rnours, bloody fluxes, jaundice, .and the vvhole train of hyfierical afteClions•.
l\1ars occafions· melancholy, 9ifeafes- of the lungs, fifrulas, hot ulcers, and
putrefaClions.. If l\1t;rcury co-operates wi.th either of thefe ungracious
planets, it is for the increafe ofevil, adding fr~ih ·violence to the diforder, .
and perhaps fooner inducing a fatal·detern1ination.
But the properties of fo1ne bodily difeafes arife form· the variety of

For infiance, Cancer, Capricorn,.. and Pifces, cauie difeafes fron1 putre- .

latter degrees of thefe ii9ns,. they produce bodily difeafes and blemifl1es in .
the extremities·, by realon of luxations or injuries, fron'l \Vhence .arife
elephantiafis, gouts,. cratnps, and rheumatic complaints. And here it.

any ruling planet is, \Vhether benefic or malefic, ·fhe more .etninent and
po\verful its eft~Cts. \vill be.; and aHo that a ,.planet is fi.ronger when qri-
ental than when occidental; wherefore a malefic planet orientally pofited
•gives blemifhes; but an occidental, difeafes. It is likevlife to be remark.

. Of..the natural BENl., and QUALlTY of the 1\1IN·D.
·Such -is the doet.rine of bodily accidents, as deoucible from the face of
a genethliacal figure·; .hut ·the qualities of ·the mind., .as rational apd
..mental, are judged of from the confiitution of Mercury \vith regard to
different figns and planets. That \vhich appertains to the ieufe alone,
.or that ·renders it irrational, is confidcred from the more corporeal fiate
of the luminaries; that is, of the Moon and·fiars configurated by [epa-
ration o~· application. But; fince the animal inclination is vari_
ous, this
fpeculatiou is contetnp1ated .from many a.nd divers obfervations, accord-
ing to the divedity of figns vvbich contain Mercury and the l\1oon, or
the rulings fiars which have dominion i~ them, and that confer their in-
flu~nces to the tetnper and quality of the mind; together·\Vitb the con-
.figurations of thofe fia.rs 'vhich have refpect to the. Sun and the angles
confidered as to the proper and difiintl nature \vith \\'hich each of
them act upon the mental 1notions of each individual. It is there-
fore ger~era11y found that tropical figns rende'r the native's 1nind highly
ingenious, full of .invention, e~ager in' the purfuit of 1noral and political
kno\v]cdge, and qf great- (ortitt1de and per{eyer~nce. D ouble-bodied
figns agitate the.rn1ind with. a variety of whimfical and very ufelefs pur-
fuits, lead the tongue to loquacious habits, and induce to negligence and
folly. -- Fixed figns mortify the mind \vith prudence and virtue, and gi'.e
a bias to reconotny, chaffity, and temperance. Again, oriental confi-
gurations produce mental qualities of a frrong and ingenious nature, free,
open, and undilfembled, quick of app~ehenfion, confrant, judicious,
benevolent, and chafte; but the occidental ones a& upo~ the mind

in a very oppofitc manner, inclining the native to profligacy and intcnl-
perance, and impairing the intellect by a naturally vicious difpolitlOU.
It is like\vife a jult obfervation, that if the fl:ars \Vhich have uorninion
are pofited in ~ood places of the figure, and \veil configurated, they render
the mental endo\vmcnts cxquifitely perfeCt, and induce to a general ~ood
fortune. This is moll: remarkably obvious in thofe gcuitures. \Vhich
have Mercury \Veil configurated, and joined \Vith the teparation or ap...
plication of the Moon. But, if Mercury and the l\1oon are not thus
diipofed, or are affliCted by the evil rays of the malefics, they \Vill even
then i1nprint the quality of their natures upon the foul, though not fo
frrongly, bu~ in a lefs obvious and more obfcure degree; not tending
fo much to good fortune and advancement in the common concerns of
life. Hence the property of the ruling planet, whether good or evil,
inftils its O\Vll nature into the animal 1pirit, with a power and energy
equal to its predominancy in the heavens at the hour of birth; and this
energy is either frrengtheoed or diminilhcd according to the force and
aCtion of fubordinate configurations; for thofe \vho, by reafen of firon.
g
malefic rays, are prone to violence or injuftice, have not their vicious in,
clioations hindered, unleis thefe evil rays are oppofed by fome contrary
effect; but, if a contrary afpect oppofes this familiarity of the malefics,.
the evil inclination is then proportionably correCted, and the mind is.
more cafily brought to a proper fenfe of its intetnperate purfuits. By
the fame rule, thofe 'vho are goog-and jufi, becaufe born under a fami...
liarity of benefic ftars, \villingly and cheerfully purfue a life of recti-
tude and virtue; and, being naturally fortunate as .well as prudent, .their·
11ndertakings generally prove advantageous and profitable; but, if a con-
trary afpeCt oppofes this happy familiarity of the bencfics, either a lefs
exemplary conduct, or a more unprofitable purfuit of \Vorldly concerns~
is fure to mark the charaCter of the native through all the different fl:ages.
ofhis life.
Thus far \ve have confidered the influences of Mercury and the !\1oon

difpofition, remarkably fordid, felf-fufficient, and enviou.s; but, if he
be but i.ndifferently pofit.ed in refj>ett · to the angles and the ·world, he ·
difpofes the tnind t9 treacherous inclinations, fraught \Vith fuperfi:ition, \
cowardi~e, and meannefs. If he is found in a concordant ·familiarity
with Jupiter, and both i1i good pofitions of the-'figure, they qualify the .
mind with better _
inclinations, and .difpofe· it to acrs of be"
nevolence,
prudence, and magnatii~ity; but, if·they are con~gured in evil places
of the :figure, they V\'Ork a COntrary effect, difpofing tbe 1nind to turbu-
lence and cruelty, and to various acts of hyprocrify an'd fraud. If Saturn
b~ in good afpect with Mars, and \veil pouted in the figure, he difpofes
the inclination to great and ·arduous undertakings, remarkable for in-
trepidity and courage in war, and for a \vatchful, laborious, inflexible,
and collecled, mind, though tnuch difpofed ~o acts of violence, tyranny,
and oppreffion; but, if they are found in bad pofitions of the figure, they
produce a mind , given up to every fpecies of fraud and impofition, and
wholly abandoned to impiefy and wickednefs. If united to Venus, ia
elevated pofitions, he renders the rnind libidinous and lufi:ful, given to
diffipation and inten1perance, but (t1bjeCl: to fufpicion and jealou(y in
refpect of women; but, if unhappily difpofed in the houfes of the figure,
he will induce the mind to the moft filthy uncleanlinefs, and to other acts
of the bafeft and moft reproachful ki11d. If Saturn hath fatniliarity vvith
Mercury, in a good pofition, he addi.Cl:s the mind to the faber ftudy of
the polite arts, or bends the in:clination to the purfuit of fome particular
improvement or ne\V difcovery in the fciences; and in general renders
the difpofition fedate, careful, and induftrious ;· but, if they be confi-
gurated \Vith each other in evil places, they incline to treachery and
ltnfaithfulnefs, <:iifpofe the .mind to the recollet!ion of paft injury, and
urge to malice and premeditated reven-ge. This variety of mental af-
feCtions · chiefly proc~eds from' the ,influences of Saturn, but .they are .
moderated, and differet~tly difpofed, according to the nature and force of
thofe rays, which, as we have feen, are refpeetively contributed by the
· pr.efence of other pl~nets. ,
.
Jupiter having alone the domit~ion of his minrt, nn'd being \veil pofited
in the figure, influences the animal foul to the moft noble and exalted
ideas of honour and re8:itude, difpofing to magnanimity in the caufe· of
morality and virtue, and leading the operative faculties to every praife-
' vorthy aCt of generofity and benevolence, but, if Jupiter is pofited in any
difcordant part of the figure, his influences have lefs effett; for, though
they

they itnprint the fatnc natural impulfc upon the mind, leading to all good
and n1oral purfuits, yet it is in a much more faint and obicurc n1an_
ner,
being accompanied \Vith a great degree of indolcuce and inatlivity. If
Jupitcr hath configurntion \Vith Mars in a good potitiou, he produces a
tlery rind itnpctuous difpofition, bold, daring and courageou..,, and given
to the purfuit of great and arduous entcrprifes; but, if evilly ditpotcd
\Vith l\1ars in the figure, he induces to an unmerciful, fcditious, and
uu!l:able tnind, prone to turbulence and faction, and given up to all the
irregularities of an evil and dii11pated inclination. If Jupiter be in
fa1niliarity \Vith \Tenus, and \\'ell pofited, he difpofcs the miud to fcnti-
lnents of liberality aud jufiice, gives ingenuity and perfevcrancc, aud
firengthens the intcllett by a capacious memory; but, if placed in
di{cordaut parts of the figure, he difpofcs to the purfuit of fenfual and
lafcivious pleafurcs, and gives a turn for loofe and diforderly converfation.
If Jupiter hath configuration \Vith Mercury, and in go?d places, he
difpofes the nlind to the pnrfuit of learning and wifaom, and gives
tho!e. natural endo\vments of a refined intelleEt, \Vhich produce the n1oft
accompliihed ·politicians, orators, poets, painters, or mathematicians ;
and is .indeed one of the moll: happy configurations that aCtuate and
govern the mental faculf.s; but, if he hath an evil configuration \vith
1v1ercury, he induces tl tnind to vanity and enthufiafm, leads to felf-
conceitedne!s and fuperfl: ·on, and gives levity, loquacioufi1e1s, and filper--
ficial ideas.
· l\1ars having alot1e the dominion ·of the mind, and \ven· po.flted in the:
ngure, produceS· a bold, confident, and intrepid, fiJirit, given to vioience
and \var, impatient, tyrannical, and arbitrary, intermixed \V-ith an ex-
t~rnal !how ofr reCl:ittlde and generofity; hut, if unhappily di1pofed, he
influences the tnind .to· barbarity.and malev·olence, given to implacable
hatred and inhuman revenge, and difpofes the foul to the perpetration
of the tnofi dark and malicious aets of cruelty -and fraud. Having fa-
n1iliarity with Venus, .and happily fituated in· the figt1re, he gives a
tnind fraught 'vith liberality aud cheerfulnefs~ difpofed to fincerity and
friendlhip, to circutnfpeClion. and fobricty, and fqnd of mirth and plea-
furc; but, if in an evil pofition of the figure, he inclines to drunkennefs..
and debauchery, and furnifhes a mind g~ven to. treachery,, deceit,.and.
every fpecies of in1morality.. If Mars hath familianty \Vith l\1ercury in...t
a profperous fiation, he gives a mind happily formed for the conducting
<;>f military or naval affairs, furnifhcs the foul \Vith a thirfl: for greaL and

if.evilly difpofed, he furniihes a carelefs and inconftant mind, prone to
wicked and n1ifchievou~ praCtices, and fond of difcord, firife, and
fedition,.
Venus alone having government of the intelleB:ual faculties, and \veil
placed in the figure, endows the mind with .complacency and foftnefs,
renders the fentiments delicate, modefr, and well difpofed, and the man-
ners fweet and engaging; but, contrarily fituated, ihe induces.to \van-
tonnefs, floth,. and effeminacy, fraught with cowardice and profligacy.
Having familiarity with Mercury, and in a profperous pofition, fhe leads
the mind ~o a reliili for philofophy and fcience, gives eloquence and in-
genuity, and forms an intelleCt for divinity, ·la\v, or phyfic; but evilly
difpofed, ~e gives a treacherous and unftable mind, bent on perverfenefs
and contention., and given to flander., hypocrify, and intetnperance.
If l\1ercury alone hath the dominion and government of the mind, he
inclines it to the purfuit of prudence and wifdom, gives a turn for in-
genious {peculations, and tafl:e for poetry and fcience ; the retentive
faculty is·generally frrong, and the \Vit lively and penetrating ; but, if
he be pofited in an unpropitious part of the figure, he difpofes the mind
to forgetfulnefs and indolet1ce, and.influences to the purfuit of mean and
crafty objec.ts ; rendering the native mutable and unfready in n1ind and
judgment, and iu mofi: cafes rath, inconfiderate, and fubject to error.
The luminaries, like\vife, hav~ their pecular operation.s upon the-tnind
and mental faculties of the native ; for the Moon, being in her greateft
north and fouth latitude, renders the motions of the ·animal foul more
various, crafty, and mutable; but, when fhe is in her nodes, fhe makes
them tnore quick, aetive, and fi)rightly. In oriental pofitions, and in- l
creafing in light and motion, ihe gives a more open, free, and ingenuous,
n1ind ; but, ifdecreafing, fhe r.enders the imagination dull, languid, and
heavy, and the ten1per changeable and uncertain. 'The Sun contributes
his eff~Cls accorditig to the familiarity or configuration he makes with
the planet which is ruler of the mental faculties. lf the afpecr be good,
and in a fortunate part of the figure, he conduces to form tbe mind more
honourable, jufi, and perfetl: ; bt1t, in the contrary pofitions, he influences
to a more abjeCt, cruel, and U.fl\vorthy difpofition.
From the foregoing premifes, the ingenious :fiudent \Vill readily infer,
that the qualities and affections of the mind are confidered, firfr, from
tbe places and pofitions of l'viercury and the Moon; fecond.

of the firft and fecond. magnitude, in or ncar the ecliptic, or that arc
nearly vertical to the place of birth, and in conjunction 'vith the fignifi-
cators, to be in any \Vile ncglctled.
\Ve may Jikewife add, that Mercury. in conjunCtion \Vith the Su1
1
produces a 1nind fitly formed for the prudent and fuccefsful manage-
nlent of any kind of bufinefs; but, if they irradiate each other at a di(-
tance of t\venty or t\venty-four degrees, the tnind \Vill be altogether
unfit for bufineis, or a.ny aCtive line of life, but mofily difpofed to frudy,
or to a fedentary calling. In equinoB:ial or tropical figns, Mercury has
the fame incitement to activity and public bufinefs as 'vhen bodily con·
figurated to the fun; but in watery figns he acts contrarily, in other figns
more varioufiy, but al\vays heft where befi dignified.
If Mercury be af.Rieted ·with malevolent planets, the.wit is ahvays
dull, flow, and fl:upid; if fwift in motion, he renders the mind quick,
but inconfiant; if retrograde, dubious, and unfixed; if under the Sun-
beams, the 1nind \villlean to the purfuit of ufelefS and unprofitable fpe..
culations; if pofi~ed in oriental houfes, the difpofition 'vill be open and
ingenuous; but, if in occidenuil, it \:Vill be wily, fubtle, and di!fernbling.
If l\1ercury be better dignified and fironger than the 1\'loon, the reafon·
able faculties \vill be ftronger than the fenfitive, particularly if l\1ercury
be in figns of long afcenfion, and -the Moon in thofe of ihort afceniion;
but, if I\1ercury be in commanding figns, and the lVfoon in obeying, the
native's intellect \V ill be naturally weak and impaired; aild, if the 1\rloon
chance. to be at the fame time itradiated by the affiiB:ing rays of either

ana alfo to the maleiics. For, if Merctiry ahd the Moon are in an in~

mind; the paiticular fliecies ·of which is ·k~own froin the qualities of the

derate difeaies of the mind have their radical caufe frotn an excefs o·r
defect of thofe operations "vhich induce the mental qualities; for, the
predominancy of fuch qualities naturally promotes an excefs of evil, and·
cohititutes a difeafe, in proport;.on as the ambient 'matter .is unmixed, and

colning or ·predominating in any configuration, induce a variety of
mental oifeafes, which are ,either remarkably violent, or obfcure and la-
tent, according to the nature and energy of each ·refpeCtive ruling planet....
If the benevolent -planets Jupiter and Venus have familiarity,. in ori-

called figuificators of riches, arc in an angular pofition, the acquifition of
wealth \vill happen in youth; and, if on the cu(nc; of thofe angular po-
fitions, fl:ill earlier. If they arc pofited in fucccc.lcnts, the riches \viH
prefcut thcmfelves at a middle age; if in cadent houfes, either late or

Thing~ vvhich relate to honour and dignity are deduced from the
difpofition of the luminaries, and the familiarity of the frars by which
they are furrounded. Wherefore, if both the luminaries at the time of
birth are found in mafculine figns, angular, and attended by the five
planets, the Sun by oriental fiars, ~nd the Moon by ·occidental, thofe
perfons will afpire to extraordinary po\ver and dignity, and exercife au-
thority and dominion over others, from \:vhence great tribute aud· ho-
nour .will flow. .And if thefe fut;"rounding planets.· are angular, or con-
figurated to a cardinal houfe above the earth, they \vill be great and
powerful in a fi1perior degree; but frill more fo, 'if the attending planets
make a dexter configuration to the angles a9ove the earth, \vith the Sun
in a mafculine fign, and the moon in a feminine ; for then the native
will arrive to a po\ver like that of princes, having abfolute dominion and
government, difpofing, in a comparative degree, of the iffues of life and
death.
But if the luminaries happen to be thtts pofited,·and none of the fur- .
rounding plariets are in angular frations, nor give teftimony to theangles, the ..
native \vill be great and honourable as a magifirate or general, but not
as having dominion or princely dignity. So if the furrounding planets
are fome or moil: of them in angular ilations, or configurated to the
angles, yet, if the luminaries are not in angular pofitions alfo, the native
~vill .not arrive -to fuch illufirious pre_fern1ent, and will but moderately
excel iu dignity and honour. But if ·neither of the attending p1anets is
.configurated to the angles, the native ''.rill be obfcure, and palS l1is \VhoJe
life \vithout protnotion or dignity; and if neither of.the luminaries are at
the fame .time found in a mafculine fign, nor angular, nor attended by
the benefic rays of good planets, the native's life ·\vill be abjea and mife...
rable, and his fortune hard. ~

Thus the general ·coufideration and m?tability of dignity and honour
is fought out and · determined. But many things between the t\vo ex..-
tretnes~ of dignified fiation and abject iervility muft be taken into the
account, before any reafonable judgment can be formed from the native"s
geniture ~ for \Ve mufr recolleCt, that every perfon born under the fame
propitious configuration cannot alike arrive to the felf-fame height of
dignity and honour becaufe the difference of birth and fl:atiop \vill at
once defiroy the poffibility of it; not to fay any thing of crofs afpetts,
and other baneful familiarities, "vhich n1ay either cut the thread of
life, or tend to leifen the grateful influences of be~lefic configurations..
It therefore follows, that we are not only to judge of perfonal honour-
an~ dignity, under certain refirietions, frotn the nature, quality, an~
place, ~f birth, but likewife from a due confideratioi1 of .all occurring anc}.
'itlbordinate rays, vvhich may in any fhape be liable to affeCt the figni-
cators of dignity. V\'e mufr not ho\vever forget, that, 'vhen the figni-
ficators are fo dignified.in a nativity, that no evil ray~, either tnundane
or zodiacal, or any fubordinate parallels, confpire to affiiet or diminilh their-
good influences. and the pro~ogator of life is ftrong and ~rable, be the
quality of birth what it may, and the obfcurity of the pn:rents ever·fO:
re~arkab]e, yet the infant thus brought into _

'To endeavour to afcertain tlie very profeffion or mechanical trade each

Saturn gives tefiitnony to her, fhe makes chemifis, apothecaries, dealers
in dyers and colours, or fuch as deal in w.earing appar.e1, or ·the m~terials
of which they are compofed. But, if J~piter gi:ves teftimony, the native

or t~ fome pofi of honour, or official department in the frate; or · ~viii
.obtain fome honourable ptofeffion in the navy or ar1ny by a p~rfe\·crance
in that line.
If Mars is ruler of the profeffion, and irradiated by the Sun, he leads
to all thofe branches of the mechanics \vhich are wrought by the ·
·operation of fire; ~'hence he produces all the artifices in brafs and iron;
and the workers and refiners of ·metais. But, being in..:conjunetion with
' the Sun, -he influences to huibandry, agriculture, and working in wood
.and fion.e. . If Saturn gives teftimony to hitn, he carries the inclination
,to,~·a~·ds a feafaring life, or to a love of gain by travelling, or by tr!lffiC
in foreign countries, or by dealing in flaves or.cattle. lf Jupiter gives
teftin1ony, the native's profeffion \Vill be that of the artny Qt navy, or
fome place, office, or employtnent, dependent thereon.
If l\1ercury and Venus are fo configurated in th"e genitnre as to be~
come joint rulers of the profeHion, they will produce excellent lnufi-
cians, and good compilers of mufical pieces; alfo mufical infirument
makers, compofers of fongs and gle~s, and ad1nirable fingers ; likewife
comedians, opera dancers, tumblers,. and all the tribe of exhibitionifis.
And, if Saturn gives tefiimony, he \vill n1ake jewellers, toymen, and
·dealers in ornatnents and precious frones. But, if Jupiter gives teftimony
.to them, he will dif)_)ofe the 1niud to the ftudy of politics, or <;>f national

fc:ldom happens that \\'C find very high pcrfc"'1ion, or fup :=r-cxtraordin:try

whence cotues the foundation of the con1n1on fayiog, fo llritlly cr>nfor-
mable to truth ~nd reafoo, that painters, poets, and n1uficians, o1ufi he
{o born ; that is, mull inherit from nature a firong bias for either of
thcfc profcffions, to tnake any extraordinary progref<s in them. And it
is remarkJble, thar, if Saturn gives tc.fiirnony to this joint rule of rv'lttrs
and Mercury, aU the above ingenuity :1nd tall:e \Vill be dcClroycd, and
the native become wholly un tractable and indolent, and given up to
theft, f\vin~ling, !harping, and other fpecies of fraud and violence; for
the lneans of a fu bfill.ence.
If Mars and Venus jointly take dominion of the profeffion, they pro-
duce \Vorkers and dealers in various kinds of metals; likewife hufuand-
n1cn, apothecaries, and phyficians, and all. profeffions in the nature of
plants and herbs. If Saturn gives te!l:itnony to them, they "·ill make
ignorant pretenders to mufic and divinity; and, in all other profcffions
under this configuration, the native .will betray a \Van t of ingenuity and
capacity. But, if Jupiter gives teftin1ony, the contrary effet ts \-.·ill hap-
pen; and in \\'hatever purfuit the native engages, proper to this rnixture
of the ruling planets, he will have the fatisfa::.tion of deriving both ho-
nour and profit from his labours. ·
It muft alfo be obferved, that the quality of the figns in \vhich thefe
congrelfes are made, and wherein the lords of the profeffion are pofited,
confers to the variety and advantage of fuch profeffion. Thofe of human
lhape conduce amazingly to the perfection of all thofe fcicnc~s and avo-
cations which are for the improveq1ent and inforanation of the n1irhf.
Four-footed figns contribute to the greater perfection of metallic arts,
navigation, and architeaure. Tropical and equinotl:ial figns for\V:lrd
the purfuits of hufuandry, agriculture, the 1nathematics, chernifiry,
and theology. Earthy and \Vatery fJgns to the perfection of phyfic and
furgery, to the art of conftruCling lhips, and to the profeffion of a
merchant.
Again, if the Moon poffeifes the place of the profeffion, havi ng con-
figuration \Vith Mercury, at her conjundion \vitb the Sun, either in
'I'aurus, Capricorn, or Cancer, lhe \V ill conduce to greater fag:1city and
penetration in whatever pr.ofcffion the native happens to follo\v. If this
configuration happens in Sagittarius or Pjfces, it conduces co a mela.n-
cboly and timid purfuit of bufinefs, and burthens the ·auind \Vith enthu-

· Thus the kinds and qualities of profei1io.ns are to be fought out in a
general !''ay, and defcribed accordingly ; but the importance and extent
of them mull: be confidered from tne firength and dignity of the ruling
fiars. For, b.eing oriental or angular, they make th-e profeffion eminent
and profitable: but, if ·occident~), or declining from angles, it \Vill be.
unimportaqt, m·ean, and unprofitable. lf·the benefics are fuperior, the
profeffion will be.erninent, honourable, and conducive to great riches ;
but, if the mal~fics are.fuperior, it will be mean, inglorious, and wholly
unprofitable. Saturn is found to d\!ftroy the benefi-ts of an adive pro-
fe~on by· tardinefs, indifference, and inaCtivity; but Mars through
boldnefs, loftinefs, 'and prefumption; wherefore both aa in oppofition
to the fuccefs and advantage of the. native's profeffion. But the general
caufes of the failure or profperity of bufine_fs mufi be judged of from
the difpofi tion and quality of the ftars which produce this effect; and
this in reference .to .the oriental and occidental angles. The eaft angle
def?qtes the beginning of life; the weft angle the end; and the tnid..
heaven the .rniddle part, from about thirty to forty years; and, as the
fJgnificators are difpofed in the radical figure, fo \Vill the effetts thereof
be at the fet time of life conforn1able thereto.
.
1t mufi: be-ever remembered that the doCtrine of profeffions here laid.
down, and the effects arifihg from -fheo1, relates only to fuch as are fol-
lowed in confequence of the natural impulfe of the ruind; in which cafes
alone we are to feek for adequate fuccefs and perfetl:ion in the profecu..
tion of them. An1o_
ng the obfervations \Ve make of the comrnon occur...
rences of life, we too Qften find youth con_
figned to fucb' employments,
by the will a.r caprice of their parents, as they are neither defigned for

that fo many bunglers rife up in all trades and profefHons, who, :finding
~heir bufinefs a continual Joad of oppreffion and perplexity, either aban-
don it _
altogether, or elfe become indolent, fottilh, and inaetivet to the
utter ruin of their families and to _the general annoyance of the more
indufirious part of mankind. .Fro1n this confideration, parents and

as far as prudence \vill admit, according to the natural bent and genius
of

Of M A R R I A G E.
1·o what h3s been (aid follows the confideration of Marriage, or the
fit conjuntl:ion and living together of man '\nd woman, according to the
divine ordinance of the..Supreme Being. And, as this law \Vas evidently
efiablilbed froan ~he beginning of things, as well for the propag:aion of
.the fpecies as for the 1nurual comfort and happinefs of the {exes, it were
fenfelefs to fuppofe human nature void of the impulfe of reciprocal love;
or that the invoJuntary actions of the foul, by which it is moved towards
the objeB: of its affections, have not a radical caufe in the order of na-
ture. If this be admitted, it cannot furely be deemed a fubject of ridi-
cule, to believe that this, as well as the other important tranfac:tions of
Dur Jives, 1nay be fought out by a concemplation of the celefiial bodies.
...
To invefiigate this point, therc;fore, in refpeCt to men, let the pofi..
tions and confiitutions of the Moon be particularly confidered. For.
when ihe is found in ~he oriental quadrants at the time. of birth, lhe
influences the native to the confummation of marriage at an early period
of his life; but, if pofited in the occidental quadrants, he will probably
Jive lingle till the approach of old age, and then n1arry a very young
wonlan. If the Moon be affiicled by the Sun-beams, and in config.ura-
tion \vith Saturn, in either of thefe politicos the--native \vill never m~ury
at ~11. If fl1e be found in a fign of one fonn, and tnaking application to
one·planet only.. the native will 1narry but once; but, if pofited in a hi-
corporal or 6gn of many forms, and making application to feveral {lars
in the fame fign, he will be fcveral times tnarried. And, if the fi~rs
\vhich receive the Moon's application, either by a conjundion, fextile, or
trine, are benefic, the wives \\'ill be good and virtuous; but, if the ap-
plication be made to malefic pfanets, and by evil configurntions1• tht:y
will be altogether of an oppofite defcription. Therefore if Saturn r<!-
ceives the Moon's application, it indicates a laborious, but fuHen, fro-
ward, and ungovernable, wife. If it bt: made to Jupiter, lhe tvill be free,
opt:n, and generous., truly virtuous, and a good houfewife. If to Mars,

.{be ·,vill be bold, fr ubborn, an4 refratlory. If to Venus, cheerful.,
complacent, affable, and chafie. ff to Mercury, wife, firudenc, 1~ving,.
and confl:ant. But, if Mars irradiates the place, (he \"'rill be furly, paf-
fionat~, talkative, and unfteady.
I '
For the porticulars of·mardage rn Te~peEl: ·of··women, we are ·to confider
t~e pofitions of the Sun, infte.ad of the Moon; for, if he be {i-tuated in.
-the orieotal ·houfes, ~t the tin1e of birth, the native will either marry very
young, or elfe at an advanced time of life to a young n1an; but, if the
Sun be found in the occidenttal houfes, rlhe -will -marry late, or to a man
far advanced in years. And.a) fo, if he be fituated in a fign of one form...
!he wiU 1narry but once; but, if in a flgn of many forms, or configurate.d
to many oriental llars, the will .have more hufbands than one, who will
partake of·the .fame nature and q-ualities as the ftars to which the confi-
gurations are mad~. .Thus.i Saturn, if configurated to the Sun, "'PI
indicate fober, grave, ar:td laborious, hufbands, but cold and phlegmatic.
Jupiter difpofes them to .tnore opennefs of mind, and generofity. M<1rs.
1nakes thenl .violent, warm, unruly, paffionate, and arbitrary. Venus
fore!he\v.s them to be indulgent., fond, good-nltured, and handfo(ne.
M.erc.ury difpofes·.them to be careful, prudent, induftrious, and faithful.
But, if Saturn be joined wirh Mercury, they will be churlifu and re-
fer.ved; if'.with V.enus, they will be dulJ, four, and inconfiant: if with.
Mars, quick', lively, lull:ful, and fond of variety. ·Thofe are ht re to be ·
.confidcfr-ed the oriental.quarters in r~fpect of the Sun, which precede the
ori~ntal and occidental tlgn Qf the zodiac; and, in refpeCl: of the Moon,
thofe from her new 'and full to ,her other quart~rs; and the occidental
houfes are ·the1fe w.bich fall op.pofite to the foregoing...

As to e~ents that occur after marriage, that is a diff(!rent '(peculation,
and requires great attention to the following particulars. Whenever the

· Again, if the benefic rays of the fortunate planets behold the confi.
gurations of the 1un1inarics in rnutual reception, the marriagc \Vi ll be
durable, confiant, happy, and profitable. But, if the malcnc planets
irradiate the places, the marriage will be unhappy, contentious, and
miferable. If the luminaries are not configurated in mutual reception,
yet, if the benetlcA give: tefiimony to them, the marriage \viii be mode-
rately happy and durable; and, when !lrife and difagreements happen,
the faun~ v;ill \\'ear off, and reconciliation will take pL~ce bet\Yeen them;

minaries, inconfiancy and i nfidt:1ity \V iII enfue, and the n1arriage \Vi Jl
be dallolved \Vitb 'fcandal and difgrace. If Mercury be joined \vith the
maltfics, the feparation \Viii be for hatred and difiike, and by n1utu:~l
coufent ; but, if .Yenus gives tefiimony to them, it will be a di\'orcc by
due courfe of law, for infidelity ~nd adultery.
Marriages, in other refpeCls; are confidered from the fall;liliarities and
connexions of Venus, Mars) and Saturn. For, if thefe are all three
configurated \Vith the luminaries, the n1arriage will be good, domefl:ic.
aod profitahle; by reafon of the affinity which the benefic planet Venus
hath with 1.\tlars and Sa.turn; with Mars, becaufe of youth anJ florid coun..
tenance, feeing they have exaltation in mutual trigonal figns, as M.ars in
Capricorn, the triplicity~ of Venus, and Venus in Pi fees, the triplicity
of IV1ars ; or Mars in· Pifct!s, the exaltation of Venus, and V ~nus in
Capricorn, the exaltation-of Mars. So lakewife Capricorn and Libra are
comn1on to Saturn and Venus; for Venus in LibrJ hath houfe, and Sa..
turn triplicity; and in Capricorn Saturn hath houfe, :and Vc:ous tripli-
ciry; and hence lhe bears ~elation to Saturn by an old ~r col11plexion,
feeing they have tl}eir houfes trigonal to e(1ch other. Wherefore Venus
with Mars conduces to make the inclin~tions more fond and amorous;
~n·d Mercury, gi\•ing t~fi:j rnony to them, q ualtfies the paffions, and keeps
the fenfual appc:tite \Vithin rJt.ion<!l bounds. If Venus be found in any
of the ahove familiar and promifcuous figns, the indic3tes marriag~s be-
t\Yetn kinfmen and relations; or, if lhe be \vith the Moon in a lnafcu-
line geniture, it pn:diets th.at two fifters, or near relations, \Vill be mar-
ried to th~ fatnt: man; but if !he be thus configurated to Jupiter, or the
Sun, in a teminine geniture, it lhews the wotnan will marry two bro..
thers, or t\yo men that are· nearly related. . i '

]arly ·if. the configuration be made in the firfl:· or latter degrees of Aries,.
near the Hyades, in the latter degrees of Leo, or upon the face .of Ca-
pricorn. And, if thefe planets occ.upy the two1principal angles, namely,
the afcendant or tnidheaven, thefe libidinous affections will be the more
ftrong; open, and 9tfenfive, ma'king the party glory, as it were, in lafci-

'or 9uration; they will be naturally weak and puny, by being void of a

1 all thefe cafes it.tnnft be remembered, that tvhenever the malefic

.in each .condition, either of all the children, or of a few, or mofi, as they
are found n1ore powerful, by .being more oriental or angular,· or n1orc: ele-
vated or fuc~edent. If therefore the lords.of thofe figns, being givers of
children; are orientally pofited, or in good places of the figure, the cbil-

The things which relate to friendlhip anc.l enmity are confidercd by
obferving the principal places of the geniturc, \vherein the figoificators
thereof have familiarity or afpett; together with the weaknefs or fireogth
of then1. 'fhe great and more durable familiarities or differences of thefe
ftars are termed fympathies and enrnities; and the fmall and temporary
fan1iliarities are called focieties and contentions: '1 o difcover thefe, \VC
tnufl: carefully obfcrve the places of tl)e Sun and Moon, in refpeel: to the
horofcope and part of fortune; for, if thcfe happen in the fcune figos, or
if they change places when rifing, and are not more than feventeen de-
grees difiant, they fore!lle\V long and faithful friendlhip. But, if they
are inconjuntl, or polited in oppofite figns, they produce great 2nd im-
placable enmity and hatred. If the lun1inaries arc not found in any of·
thefe fituations, but are only configurated in figns, t:ithcr by trine or
{ex tile, they lhe\v fl,ight and precarious friendlhip; but, if by quartile,
fmall~and impotent enmity. Hence it happens that friendfl1ips ceafe, and
appear as it were at an utter end, while the malefics tranfit the configu-
ration; and_yet, when thefe are over, the friendlhip is again rene\\'ed,
and murual civilities and good offices take place, ·as if no fuch circum-
frances b~d happened. So, in like manner, the tnalicious objeas of. ha-
tred and enmity feem to ceafe and lie.dormant, when the benefic fiars
are n1aking their iogrefs upon the configuration; but .are rene\ved \Vith.

Friendiliip ~nd enmity are therefore confidered .under three kinds; for·
men are obferved to be fo difpofed either by election, or for profit, or
for forrow or pleafure ;. and, when either all or moll: of the forementioned
places have familiarity with each other, friendiliip is conftitued by thefe
three kinds; but, if tlJefe places are found uoagr~e.1ble, then enn1ity arifcs
in a fimi1ar manner. \Vhen the places of the 1umiuaries alone have fa--
Oliliarity, friendlhip \Vill arift:: .frotn eleCtion, involuntary choice,. or na-
tural regard, \V hich is 'the mofi firnl and lafiing; but,. if the places of the
luminaries are contrarily difpofed,. hatred is after the fame manner pro-
duce_d, and is 'the moil invt:terate and fatal. When the place of p.1rt of

horofcope, they are produced by thofe aCliops of the mind which arife
fronl melancholy and cholf~r, or from vivacity and good humour. But
in all t~efe cafes we mufi: p~rtic.ularly obferve the ftars elevated above, or
configurated with, each of thefe refpeclive places; for that place lhall
: give·a higher degree of friend!hip or enmity than any other, ·tO which
the elevation or fucceffion of ftars is the neareft, vJhether in the fame fign
or the adjoining. But the. place \vhicb pafres the fiars in co,nfiguration, .
if the fiars are friendly, denqtes advantage a~d interetl: to be the caufe of
friendlhip; ,or, if.difcordant fiars occur, enmity \viii arife from intercfied
motive~, which will expire with.the caufe of it.
The foregoing obfervations a.re applicable to the tnofi: extravagant and
]afiing infiances of friendlhip and en1nity; but thofe which arife fron1 ·
more temporary and trivial ~aufes have a Clifferent fpeculation. The
com0100 occafions of friendfhip or animofity, \:4lhich arife in the general
purfuit of bufinefs Or p)eafure, or \Vbich arife fron1 mixing \Vith the
world, are only to be deduc.ed from the motion of the ~ars, taken in
both ge·nitures, in order to find when the .fignificato~s in ·one nativity
fhall come to the fame point in the other nativity; for at fuch periods
there \\rill arife particular friendlhips oa; entnities, \vhich \\·ill have du-
ration no longer than the refpeCt.ive familiarity or connexion of thefe
ftars exi{L S~turn and Jupiter coming in this tnnnner to each other's
places, caufe friendfi1ip., by meeting in focieties or company; or by ~gree­
.tnent in hu.fuandry and agricu~lture, or by the joint inherita'lce of for-
tune.s. Saturn a.nd Mars produce firife and contention, and often fore-
1bew premeditated fraud and villainy. Saturn and Venus denote love and
frien"dfuip through the interference of kindred, but has no duration. Sa:-
·turn and Mer,cury produce friendlhip by converfation or connexion in .
bufinefs, fcience, or confederacy. Jupiter and Mars prodl}ce enn1ity by
politics., ialprope~ preferment, or interefied meafures of government.
Jupiter .and Venu_
s occaflon friend1hip through the interference of wo-

attachment to literature, fcience', and philofophy. Mars and Venus

of the Moon. For, if 01e b_e found in the feventh houfe, arJd declining

tual change of place to the native. Mars hitnfc::lf, bei!1g occidental, or

tion to the luminaries, \vill produce the fame inclination in a {ome\vhat
Jefs degree. But, if ~1e part of fortune falls i!l the farne fign \Vi th the
fignificator of travelling, the principal part of the life and adions of the
native will be fpent in a foreign co.untry. ·

Whenever the benevolent planets irradiate the above-mentioned places
of the luminaries, of Mars, or the part of fortune, or fucceed to them,
the native's travelling will be glorious and profitable; and his return
fafe, and without impedi1nent; but, if the malevolent fiars behold or

ho\vever, the quality and temperament of die leiTer familiarities. as they
add to, or take from, the pot-ver and force of their configur'\tions, muft
be invariably attended to. If the luminaries incline or fall to the ori-
ental quadrants, the travelling will be towards the eafl:ern or fouthern
parts of the globe, confidered in refpeet to the place of birth; hut, if
they are found in the occidental quadrants, the peregrination \Vill be to-
wards the north or \Vefi. If the iigns in \vhich the fignificators of tra-

1~ he Sun, being found in the fpace of twilight, ought to be directed
above para) lel circles to the horizon, aFld not above horary circJes, as
'A ben the Sun is above the earth. If the Sun he fou 'nd in the morning
t\vilight,- firfi. direll: the Son [O the degree of the afpect under the Jati-
tude of the place, although· the Sun is not there, and after\vards take
the difiaoce of the Sun frorn the horofcope, in oblique afcenfion, which
calf the .Sun's prirnary diftance; and be'careful that this ditl:ancc be not
greater than the p'lrallel of twilight, \lvbich does not exceed eighteen de-
grees, for, if it be, the Sun is not in that parallel, and in this cafe you 1nufi:
work by the follo\ving·rule; but, if ,the Sun be in the pa~alkl of twi-
light, then, wjth the difiance of the Sun froo1 the horizon above taken,
t nter the table of twilight under the.latit ude of the place, which is in the
top of the table, and with the fign and degree in the nead or f-oot of the
table; and .in the angle of meeting, or body of the table, find the aif-
tance of the Sun from his rifing, and obferve the d~gree of the para.llel
of t\vilight. ·which the Sun po!fe!fes in the firil: column, taking the pro..
porti'onal part of the Sun's place to degrees; and under the fan1e parallel
look out the difiance of the:: di~etti-on, that is to fay~ what di(l~nce the
Sun is from the borofcope, in that parallel of tvvilight; and this difta~ce
call the fecondary difian<;e; then, if both the' firfi and fec·ond diltance
are equal, the trut! arch of direclion is that which was firfl: taken in the
horo1cope; but, if they are not equal, fubtratl: the lefs from the greater,
and the retnainder ca11 the oriental diftance; and, if the fecon-
dary dill:ance
be great.er than the prirnary, then fubtra<l the oriental difiance frotn the
arch of direCtivn, and the remainder is the true arch of direCtion, which
is to be equated as before. In feeking the primary ditl:ance of the Sun
from the horofcope, in the tables of twilight hereafter inferted, it is
fufficient to take· the proportional part of the degree only, rejetl:ing the
minutes, \vhich, when ta.keo, note the degree of the depreffion or. paral-
lel of twilight, and in the right ·line with the parallel diftance find the
neare!t proportional difia_nce, which when found by proportional parts,
the firfi prinu1ry natural difiance of the Sun may be negletted, for it is not
' necefi:1ry to take the degrees and minutes of the depreffion of twilight, but,
it is only tbe greatefi: and the pearefi degree of the ~un's longirude \Vith
the proportional part; as for example: the Sun direc1ed to the quartile
of Mercury in no degree of Cancer, Mercury being in no degree of Aries
at birth; at the fame time eleven degrees of Pifces afcend. In the latitude

eight tninutcs; the ditfcrcnce is eighteen degrees forty-three minutes,
Enter· the table of t\vilight in the L1titude of forty-four degrees, and
there ]aok for this difiancc, eighteen degrees forty...thrce minutes, aod
alfo for lixtcen degrees of Aries, \vhich cannot be found; but there is
ten degrees and t\vcnty degrees, \vhich is near enough ; no\V, under ten
degrees of .~rics is eighteen degrees thirty-t\vo minutes, and under t\venty

ninc minutes. 1"'hen I fi1y, If ten degrees give t\venty-nine minutes, \Vhat
flutll fix degrees give?· Anf\vcr, feventecn n1inutcs i \vhich, being added
to eighteen degrees thirty-t\VO minutes, make eighteen degrees forty-nine
minutes; and againfr that, in the .firft column, is the para!Jcl of t\vilight,
thirteen degrees, required.
No\v the Sun's pritnary ,diflance,. viz. eighteen degrees forty-three mi-
- nutes, being neglected, as aforcC1id, I take eighteen degrees forty-nine
minutes; then looking out the nfpcCt, \vhich faJls in no degrees of Can-
cer, under the latitude forty-four degrees, · and thirteen degrees parallel
of t\vilight, l find t\venty-four degrees forty-five minutes, 'vhich is the
fecondary diftance, and is greater than the primary by fi\'e degrees fifty-
_
:fix minutes; the oblique afccnfion of the Sun is eight degrees t\venty-
eight minutes, and both under the ·latitude of forty-four degrees. No\V [
fubtraet the oblique afcenfion of the Sun from the oblique afcenfion of the
afpeCl:, and tbe diflcrence is fifty-fix degrees forty-two minutes. And, bc-
caufe the fccondary diftancc is greater than the primary, I fubtraCt five
degrees fifty-fix minutes frorn the .aforcfaid fifty-fix degrees forty-two
minutes, and there re1na_in fifty degrees forty-fix minutes, the- true arch
of dired:ion required, \Vhich is to be equated as before. If the Sun is to

The ·afpeCl:s in the \vorld are proportional difl:ances by ,their motion
about the world; for, a fiar that lhall be difrant from the horizon a third
part of his diurnal arch !hall cafi his fextile to the afcendant; and, if he
be half his diurnal arch, he will caft a quartile to the afcendant ; and
two third·parts of his arch is a trine, and his whole arch is an oppofition;
therefore -the. firfr houfe, is in fextile to the eleventh and third, and in
quartile to the tenth and fourth ; in trine to the ninth and fifth, and in
oppofition to the feventh; and fo of the reft. And, although the diurnal
and noCturnal arches differ among themf~lves, yet t~e boufes.have no dif..
tinction, .. property, n~ture, or force, of themfelves, but \Vhat they re-
ceive from the fbtrs, and in the divifion of the houfes by double horary

110 more refped; tO the ecliptic than if there.\Vere no fuch thing; for they
have only refpetl: to the femidiurnal and feminocturnal arches of the
flars; and the afpeCl:s they tnake in the \Vorld, to any houfe or from any
hotife, have no refpeCl: to the ecliptic, but according to their fen'lidiur-
nal and feminoCl:urna1 arches, or 'according to their motion about the.

To dire[/ the Midheaven or the Afiendant to the Sextile, ~artile, .or Trine,

· If you would direCt the midheaven to a fextile of any flar that is
placed either in the _t\veJfth, afcendant, or fecond houfc, you have only
to do·thus: "fake the oblique afcenfion of the cufp of the ·twelfth houfe,

bo~y of any p1~net, at the fame time the midheaven comes to the fex- _
tile; and, \Vben the afcendant comes to the body of any ftar, at rhe fame
time ·the midheaven is direCted to the quartile thereof; alld, when the

heaven comes to the trine; fo that by ahvays obfcrving this rule, it \Viii
be impoiliblc to err; for thcfc afpctl:s in the \Vorld are not tnauc bv their
diOance in fig~s, degrees, and n1inutes, but by their difi:1ncc according to
the order or fucccffion of the houfcs,· \vhich ditlances arc nfccrtained by the
temidiurnal or feminodurnal arches.
The fame rule is alfo to be followed in directing the afcendant, as \Va~
obfervcd in the n1id-heaven; for if it be required to direCt the nfcendant
to a fextile, \\'C have no more to do than to direct the cufp of the ele\·enth
houie if the promittor be above the earth, or the cufp of the third houfe
if he be under the earth, to his body; in both of \vhich cafes the
afcendant \viii be found to come to his fextilc. If it be required to direct
the afcendant to a quartile, obferve 'vhether the promittor be above the
earth. ancJ if fo, direct the mid-heaven to his body; l>ut if under the .
earth, diretl: the cufp of the fourth houfe to his body, ei•her of \vhich
operations \Viii bring the afcendant to his quartile. But if tbe afccndaut
is to be diretl:ed to a trine, then, if the promiuor be above the earth,
direct rhe ·cufp of the ninth houfe to his body, but, if under the earth,
the cufp of the fifth houfe, \vhich \viii in the fame rnanner bri ~g the
afcendat1t to his trine. . By an attention to thefe rules, the angular houfes
1nay at all tin1es be directed \Vith fingular eafe and exatlnefs j for having
found the cufp of the houfe required, we are to direct under the pole ~f
that houfc.· let the pofition of the ftar be where it \viii, \Vhich if rightly

form the afped: ~hat is betvv.:een the houfes. But in cafes w..here the lig-
nificator and promittor are differently pofited,. the following rules n1uft ~e
ouferved.
_·Suppofe a fignificator to be pofited in the t~nth houfe, and to be di- ..
reCted to the fextile of a promittor in the t\velfth or eighth houfe. Fir!l:
take the difrance, of the fignificator in right afcenfion from the tenth
h94fe, which call the primary difiance; then take the difiance of the
protnittor from the twe~f~h houfe, wnich referve; n~xt take the fen1_i..
diurnal arch of the figntficator, and alfo of the promtttor; add the two
arches together, and fay, by the rule of proportion, If two arches give
the diflance .of the pron1ittor frorn the twelfth houfe, what !hall the ,
femidiurnal arch of the fignificator give? which when found, add ·it to
the primary difiance of the fignificator, and the fum 'vill be the arch
of direction required.- But it tnufi: here be obferved, that if the fignifi-
cator had been placed beyond the .cufp of the tenth houle, or in the ninth
houfe, then the primary difi:ance muft be fubtraeted from the fecondary,
and the remainder \vill be the arch of direction. The fame rule is to be
follo\ved for the qua~tile afpect, if the promittor be in the afcendant ;
but if the promittor be pofited either in the fecond or flxth houfe, then the
fafDe rule .mufi be followed for the trine, al\vays remetnbering to take the

"If a fignificator be pouted within· three degrees of ·the mid-heaven, take

It mJy here be rcrnarked, that, ·if the fignificator and promittor be
upon or \Vithin three d~grccs of the cufp.. of t1ny other houfc, the direc-
tion is the fatnc \\'ith the houfc, and may be uirctl:cd under the pole of
that houfc, or by right afcenfion if upon the mid-heaven ns before;
but. if they arc in the defccnding part, then ufc the oppotitc places. For
example: Suppofc the Sun \Vcrc to be direetcd to a fcxtile of Jupiter, the
Sun being on the cufp of the ninth houf:, in five degrees of Leo, and
Jupiter in eighteen degrees of Cancer, the pole of birth being forty-four
degrees. N O\V I take the oppofite fign and degree, becau fe the Sun and
Jupiter are both in the defcending part of the heavens; the poles of the
ninth and third houfes are eightec:n degrees. and the oblique afccnfion •
of the Sun's oppofitc place is three hundred and fourteen degrees nearly,
fron1 \vhence I fubtratt fixty degrees, and the remainder, \Vhich is t\Vo
hundred and fifty-four degrees, is the oblique afccnfion of the afccndanr.
No\V the oblique afcenfion of Jupiter's oppofite place under the pole of
eighteen degrees. is t\VO hundred nincty-fcven degrees, from \vhcnce f.
fubtraCt the oblique afcenfion of the afcendant. viz. t\VO hundred and
fifty-four degrees, and there ren13ins the arch of diretl:ion required,
\vhich is fony-three degrees; becaufe, by the tnotion of the prirnun1
tnobile, 'vhen the afcendant comes to the oppofite place of Jupiter, the
Sun at the fame time comes to his fextilc. ·

truth and nature, his been the fubjecl: of many controverues and difputes
among tnodern authors ; arifing, .I conceive, fron1 their ignorance of the
plain and genuine fyfietn handed· to us by the immortal Ptolomy, and
from a want of refletting ~hat the revolutions of all the heavenly bodies,
as well as the periods of all earthly events, are only reducible to.' one uni-
veifal fiandard meafure of tin1e, namely, the Sun"'s geocentric motion in
the ecliptic. It is therefore furprifing that · fo 1nany i~vention.s lhould
have ariferi, and fo many errors in confequence adopted, in equating di..
re.Ctions, fince it tnuft be evident to the rnofr unlettered mind~ and a fa&

rule is nothing more than the Sun's app,arent progrefs through every de-
gree and minute of the ecliptic, meafured by·the degrees of the equator;

I flatter myfdf that the Rules given in this Syficm of DireCtions, if care-
fully attended to, \vill be amply fufficicnt to famili<trize any of rny read-
ers in this itnponant branch of the ·occult fciences, without the aid of
\vhic:h, little or nothing can be done in the Calculation of Nativities~
-· f'or though it be ac.itnitted, that a ftudcnt may n1ake great advances in the
kno\vledge of futurity. by acquiring ·an adequate con1prchenfion of the na-
ture and effeCts of the various configurations and familiarities of the cclci:
tial bodies, and of their particular.influences, both benefic and malefic, upon
the hutnan race; and, though we may by this tneans attain to kno\v that
. fuch and fuch events \Vill certainly come to pJfs, yet even thi~ acquifirion
in the fcience 1nufi be confidered incomplete, \Vithout the abiJ.ity of point-
ing out, by forne fixed and certain rule, the precife time u'hen thefe events
f11aJl happen. 'J'his is not to be attained by the methods ufed in the vu1-
g3r Afirology t as· already laid do\vn in the forn1er part of this \Vork,
\V here the con1mon Afirology is treated of, but with great ritk and. un-

his grand acquilition is therefore not to be obtained by any other
1nodc-than that of bringing up the arch of direction of each refpedivc
fignificator in the native,s ·figure of birth to .the afpcCl: \vhich denotes
each refpetl:ive event ; and this arch of diretl:ion, as I have before ob-
ferved, is nothing more than the track or circle in the heavens formed
by the fignificator in moving from· that particular point in the heavens
\Vherc he is found ar the birth. to the precife point ·\Vhere he forms the
afpeCl: 'vvith the promittor that indicates the event, \Vhich, up9n his ar-
rival there, is to happen. It is confequently apparent, that if this track ·
or circle can be found, and its content in degrees and n1inutes accurately
tclken, and reduced into cornn1on tin1e acc0rding to the motion of the
Sun, \yhich regulates all our accounts of time, it 'vill tho\v us at one

r. In this procefs confifis the "vhole myftery of afcertaining the period of
man'S Jife, \Vhich is thought fo Wonderful a matter by fon1e, and Confi-
dered altogether impoffib]e by others; and yet it is no rnore than a fimple
operation .of nature, deduced from an ~· intin1ate kno\vledge of fecond
caufes. For this -is a rule that 'Ni11 never be found to fai1, if our arith..
metic be true ; ~That at the very time the principal figni"ficator in a nativity. .
that is. the giver of life, f11all ·arriv~ at the anaretical point of the afpeet
of the kil-
ling pla~et, the na_tive !hall furely depart this 1ife; provided
.no benefic rays .at the ~anle tin1e irradiate the place, or in any refpett con-
.cur to in1pede the killing force, \Vhich n1ay always be known from the
difpofition of the benefic planets in the nativity. If this affertion be :
true, \vhich has been proved by innu.merable examples in all ages of the ·
v1.orld, and '\V hi"ch 1 trufi \NiH be confirmed by the nativities fullovving, .
it is evident that.\.Ve can, by the foregoing rules, bring up the direCtions
.\vith fufficien t accuracy to afi·ertain the precife length of time in years,
1l10nths, and days; ·in \Vhich the fignificator of life will be in moving to
·the;anaretical or killing- point; and juct fo Jong will be the 1ife of that
native. .. ·Where then ·is the n1yfiery or impoffibility of afcertainii1g the
period of"' human life, and \Vith extraordinary precifion ? But this accu-
racy. ~'vholly depends upon 1 the true time of birth being obtained ; for a
failure .here in the radical point, will defiroy the '\vhole calculation, and
nothing prediCted therefrom can poffihly happen but by the effeCt of
chance..
I
But it is here neceft:try to remark, that, in fuch natiVIties as. are· vitaI.
and afford fufficient tefl:imonies of a· firong and healthful confi:itut ion, .
one direCtion alone is feldom (ound to kill ; for in fuch nativities. there
is ·required a· trairi of malevolent directions to concur to death ; (:lnd the

After \vhat has been premifcd in the foregoing "freatiie on DireCl:ions,
the neceffity of readily finding the fen1idiurnal and feminocturnal arches
mull: become obvious. I have therefore calculated a Tnble. of them to
every degree of the ecliptic for the latitude of London, \vhich, being
n1ofl: \Vanted, \vill of courfe £-tve the practitioner iome trouble. Under
the different latitudes in the other Tables, are fpecified the femidiurnal
arches of all the northern figns, proper to tbofe latitudes; as Aries,
'"faurus,. and Gemini, at the top of the rrable; and Cancer, Leo, and
'rirgo, at ~he bottom of the Table. But, .to find the femino'Cl:urnal
arches proper thereto, it only requires to fubtratl: the femidiurnal arch
from ~\velve hours, and the remainder \Vill be the feminocturnal arch
fought. So like\vife the feminocturn~l arches for all the fouthcrn iigns
nre placed under the different latitudes' in the Tables, having Libra,
- Scorpio, and Sagittarius, at the top of the columns; and Capricorn,
Aq9aries, and Piices, at the bottom; and, to obtain the femidiurnal arches
correfponding \\'ith them, add the amount of the feminotl:urnal arch to
t\velve hours, and the fum \viii be the femidiurnal arch required j n1any

rary 'titnes, or true leng'th of · the planetary hours; and, if divided by

To find the oblique defcenfion of the planets.., with latitude, work as
by the following exaQ1ple of the Moon in the afore!:'lid figure.

twenty-nine minutes:north latitude•.
Secondly, With this declination find the tangent anf\ver·-
able therct·o, and i( \vill. be - · - - - · 8·; 894 366.

Which nun1ber feek for in the column of fines at the. top, and it will
be found anf\verable to three degrees fifty~nine min~tes, which .is called.
the afcenfional difference.
The Moon's latitude being two degrees forty-two minutes north·,.

If the declination of the Moon \&Jere fouth, the afccnfional difference
mufi. then have been fubtraacd from the right afccnfion, and the rernain·
der would have been the oblique dcfccnfion.-The I~u11C rules \tt·i11 apply
to the calculating or finding the oblique deiccnfion of all the plan~tsJ in
C\'ery degree of latitude.
· I fhaJl now fubjoin Tables of Logiflical Logarithms,. for the purpofe
of finding the part proportional, either in tirnc or motion, bet\\'crn any
t\VO planets or fignificators ; 'vhich v.-ill entirely complere this fet of
Afirological Tables, and render them an cafy and familiar guide to every
fiudent, in afcertaining the direaions of all the planets, ,,,.hcther mun-
dane or zodiacal, direl:l or converfe, that can poffibly occur in the cal--
culation of nativities, or horary qucfiions•
. To make the ufe of then1 tnore obvious to the underfianding of every
reader, I {hall fubjoin a variety of examples, fhe,vin~ ho\v to afcertain
the daily and hourly motion of any given planet ; and aHo to detennine
the precife time when any two fign1ficators will meet in one and the' fatne
point of the heavens, or form any other afpetl upon the.. horofcope or
geniture of finy inquirer, in the courfc of praElice.
The expedition 'vith \\"hich Nativities may be calculated, or A!lrolo-
gical Queries anfwered, by the aid of this {et of tables, not t<1 mention
the expedition with which the governing configurations are found, ,,.,ill
amply reward the reader for any time or trouble befio\ved in acquiring a
~omp~tent knowle?ge of them! as ~ill abundantly_apP.ear by ~h_e method
tn 'vh1ch I !hall brtng up 'the dn~ea1ons of the fubJOintng nat1v1ty of my
learned friend .l\1r. vVitchell, MaHer of the Portf1nouth l<.oyal Academy.
It may alfo be premifed, that the fiudent, v~·ell informed in aiJ the fore-
going rudiments of the fcience ; in the nature and tendency of the pla-
nets, and their various configurations ; vvill, \vith pleafing aptitude, by
the ufe of thefe tables, find himfelf qualified for the calculation of his
own or any other nativity, precifely in the fame way as 'vill be laid do\\"11
in the management of that above-mentioned, which \vill pro\·e a compe-
tent example for all others.
Thefe tables of Logifiical Logarithms are of a triple or three·fold ex-
tent; the firfl column appertains to motion ; the fecond to abfolute nutn-
bers, and the third to a correa meafure of time ; as fpecified at the top
of each table, refpeaively.
I have· thought it mofi confifient to let the tables .Precede, and the
explanatory examples follo\v; for it is itupoffible to 1mprefs the n1ind

with a proper idea~of the procefs, without often referring to thefe and the /
other tables which compofe the fet, ~s will ev~dently ,appear by what
occurs hereafter. -
-It is not abfolutely neceffary that the reader fhoul.d fludy the art of .
conftruaing lqg-arithms to underfiand the ufe of the follo,ving tabJesJ
which are here tnferted for the mere purpofe of.references, agreeable to
the fevera.I Examples that follow;-it is fufficient for the reader to know,
that addition of logarithms is the fame thing as nJul!iplication in common _
arithmetic, and fubtraE/ion in logarithms 'the fame as divifion~· therefore,
in multiplication by logarithms, add the logarithms of the multiplicand
and multiplier together, and their fum is the logarithm of the produa;
and in divifion, fubtraa the logarithm of the divifor.. from the logarithm
of the ,dividend, and the remainder is the logarithm of the 'quotient.
To extraa ~he ' roots of powers by logarithms, divide the logarithm of
the number by the index.of the power, and ~he quq~ient is ~he logarithm
of the r.oot fought; to ratfe a number to any power, multtply .the loga..
rithm of the number by the index of that power, and the product is the
logarithm of the power to which the number was required to be raifed.

A PRAXIS.
·To find the quartile of the Moon and Saturn on the t\vclfth of June,

day at noon the Moon \vi1l be found in ninete~n degrees feventeen mi-
nutes of Aries, and Saturn in t\VCnty-t\vo degrees fifty minutes of Ca-
pricorn, retro'grade. The diurnal motion of the Moon is thirteen degrees
three minutes, and the n1otion of Saturn three minutes. No·w, as Saturn
is retrogr~de, his n1otion is to be added to the !vioon's, and then the di-
urnal excefs makes thirteen degrees t\venty-one 1ninutes, with '\'hich en-

III. If·a fignificator be not pofited in the afcendant or mid-heaven, or

and, according whether it be in an oriental or occidental p~rt of the hea-

th.erein, it being his unalterable courfe, that is, \vithout Jatitude ; bur,
'vhcn he is dirttlcd to a planet or zodiacal parallel '"'ith latitude, it is
then called n dire8ion in n1undo; but, \\·hen dircaed to a planet \\·ithout
latitude, it is tcnucd a zodiacal clirc:clion, and is either dircEl or con\1
erfc,
as the n1otion of the planet is either \\'ith, or contrary to,,J.he fucceffion
of figns.
X.. rfhe Moon meets all rays in the circle of latitude in \Vhich {he
conHantly 1novcs, and that is ahvays out of the ecliptic, except \\·hcu
{he is in her nodes ; and therefore, '\Vhen fhc is direCted, as a fignificator
'vith latitude, to a promittor in the zodiac, the latitude of the ~/loonrs
place muH be found. Under this latiiude the declination mufi ~e fought,
,,rhich fllC\\~S the oblique al'cenfion or defcenfion under the pole of the
:f\,foon; and hence the arch of direaion is correaly found, by fubtraa-
ing the oblique a{cenfion or defcenfion of the Moon under her pole, not
forgetting .t.hat this oblique afcenfion or defcenfion muH be taken ac-
coraing to the latitude of her place at the hour of birth. 'fhis is called
a zodiacal diretlion 'vith latitude; but, \vhen the Moon is directed to an
afpe·a 'vithout latitude, the place of the zodiac 'rhere the afpetl falls
is to be taken \vithout latitude, both in right .a(cenfion and declination;
and thus find the oblique dcfcenfion or afcenfion of the poicyt under the
pole of the Moon; fron1 'vhich fubtraa the oblique afccnfion or defcen-
iion of the l\1oon, taken according to the latitude fhe had at the time of
birth, and the arch of direElion is found, 'vhich is to be converted into
years as before. ~ ""

XI. ·DireB.ions are of tw·o forts, zodiacal and mundane. The Sun and
Moon are capable of being dircEled both \\rays; but the anglesnfa figure
can only be· direaed in mundo, they being fubjeEt to the accidents and
divifion of no circles, but thofe "·hich conHitute the meafure of each
quadrant, and are mcafured by the parts of the diurnal and ferninottur-
nal arches; therefore they never tneet any rays '"·ith _latitude but bodies
and oppolitions.
XII. Tlte mid-heav~n and afccndant are t\\"O different'* circles;" The
tnid-h~a\'en meets all rays, and .rr1cafurcs all afpetls by the z_
odrac; ~ut

\vho ,\·ere born under the meridian of London, for ·wh1ch latitude the
Ephetnerifes are generally calculated; I {hall nov; teach how to calculate
either the· mundane or zodiacal dir~B:ions {or any other latitude, and
how a planet in one meridian may be reduced to that of another, with the
utrrioll deg!"ee of correB:nefs and precifion. ·
For exan1ple, fuppofe it "\vere required to kno'v the difference between

and on the 11th of June, at twelve o'clock at noon, the !vloon is in five
degrees forty-fix tnin.ute~ of Aries, under the Incridian of London; but,
to reduc.e it to the meridian of Brifl:ol, purfue the follo,ving rnethod.

With this difference, three degrees forty-five rninutes, look.into the Table
for turning the Degrees of the Equa.to~ into Time, in page 2o6; then
refer to Table the Second, by which it \vill be·found, that one degree
gives four n1inutes; ·and confequently, three degrees forty-five m'inutes',
the .difference of the t\VO longitudes, muft give fifre~n n1inutes ·difference
of titne in two meridians ; and, as BriHol 1s fituate \veft from London,
, the !vioon mufi be _
in five degrees forty...fix minutes of Aries, fifteen nli-
nutes before noon ·

cording to her O\vn n1otion in an hour, giveS for that tin1e, going at the
rate ·of thirty-three minutes ·forty-fevcn feconds· the quarter of an hour,
eight minutes t'venty-feven feconds, which, being added to five degre~s
forty-fix minutes, make five degrees fifty-four minutes and t'venty-feven
feconds of the Moon in Aries, at twelve o'clock at BriHol. And here
n-
ote, that, if the place 'vere fituate eaH from London, then the differ-
ence of time muH. have been fubtraEied from the meridian of London,

A COMPLETE
ILLUSTRATION
OF THK
ASTROLOGICAL
AND
OCCULT SCIENCES.
. '
H AVING, in the former volume, given at la~ge the rudiments of
the AUral Science, I fhall now proceed to the real calculation of
nativities, according to the Placidian method as laid dov.rn and exempli-
fied in this work. 1 {hall begin with that of 1nr learned and very inge·
nious friend, Mr. vVitchelJ, Mafier of the Roya Academy at Portfmouth,
a gentlen1an 'vell know'n in the literary \Vorld; as well on account of his
valuable difcoveries in the longitude, as for'his very ufeful mathematical
public.ations.
For the eafe and infiruajon of the reader, I fhall go through every cal-
culation of this nltivity, in the mofl: pratlical and intelligent manner, in
order that it may afford every neceffary example for direEting fignificators
to promittors, tn all cafes whatfoever, as 'veil as to fhew the probable
effeas to b~ deduced therefrom, in nativities in general.
. .
• The fcheme of Mr. Witchell's nativity, in the annexed plate, '~as
ereCled by hiinfelf; and, from his great veneration fot: the fcience, he
gave me leave to publifh it, and to make what obfervations l thougnt ne-
ceffary in the calculation of it.
-On examining the figur~, I found it '\'anted reaification ; and, there-
fore, according to the method pointed but in' VoJ. I. p.-426, I proceeded
to bring the eflimated time to the true time of birth. It js here to be
obferveil, that neither of the luminaries are in the centre·of the angles,
nor fortunes in parallel ofangles; but, as a noC1urnal nativity, the Moon's
fituation with Saturn prefented itfelf moU eligibly for the purpofe of rec·
tification. My bufinefs therefore 'vas to bring them in a right parallel
from the fou~h houle, 'vhich is done thus:

The next thing to be obfcrved in the copper-plate figure is the part
of fortune; \\·hich n1ufi nlfo be r~Eli(1ed, for it is very incorreClly placed
by l\1r. \Vitchcll. Its true pofition, in this nativity, is of the grcatcfl
confequcnce, both as to its pole and place ; particulaJ:Iy as it is H ylrg,
and direEh:d for the nativ(A's death; and, as the part of fortune in thts
figure depends 'vholl)r on the Moon for declination, right afcenfion. dif-
tances, &c. and hath its diurnal and noCl.urnal arches 1ncreafed or dimi-
nifhcd as the 1\tloon rifes or fets. it rnay be truly dectned a lunar horofcop~;
I fhall therefore give the following rulcs for its reElification, \\'htch
,vill hold good on every fianilar occahon. Firll, find the oblique afcen-
fion or dcfccnfion of the Sun, according to his pofition in the figure, under
his own pole, fubtracl the oblique defct>nfion of the Sun from the oblique
afcenfion of the afcendant, and the rernainder referve; then obtain the
pole of the Moon, and under the pole obtain her oblique afcenfion or
defcenfion, ,.;ith latitude, as before obferved, by the Sun; and, from
the oblique afcenfion of the Moon, fubtraEl: the diflance .of the Sun
from the afcendant, as above referved, and the remainder will be the
oblique afcenfion or defcenfion of the part of fortune; 'vhich may be
• known by its being a greater or lefs number of degrees than the mid-
heaven; for, by allo\vina thirty degrees for each houfe, it 'viii declare
in what hou{e the part of fortune falls ; and to kno\v \rhat degree of the
zodiac is anfwerable thereto, only requires to find the pole of the pare
of fortune, and, by giving it the fame latitude and declination as the
Moon, it fhews its afcenfionaJ difference, V\"hich mufi be added to or fub-
traaed fron1 the aforefaid oblique afcenfion as it is fpund either in a north- ·
ern or fouthern fign, and the right afcenfion is found ; \vhich by look-
ing in the table of right afcenfions, allowing. its latitude, if any, the de-
gree and n1inute of the zodiac is pointed out for the plAce of the part of
fortune; as exemplified in the follo\\"ing figure.

Saturn being in twenty-three degrees thirty-eight minutes of Aquarius,
enter with this degree and 1ninute in the tables ~f fen1inoaurnal arches
for the latitude of birth, which is in London, and it gives feven hours
eleven minutes, w.hich .being anf,verab1e to the fpace of three houfes, or
ninety degrees of the zodiac, I divide it by three, and one of thefe three
parts will be the C1iltance from the cufp of the fourth to the cufp of the
fifth houfe-; then by the rule of proportion find the difiance of Saturn
from the fourth houfe, as follovv"S : The third part of feven ,hours eleven
minutes is two hours· twenty·three minutes and forty feconds, which
• time convert into degrees by the table for that purpoie, in page 206;
by which it is found to give thirty-five degrees fiJty-.five minutes for~ the
!pace of one houfe. The pole of the fifth, as may be found by the table
in page 202, is twenty-three degrees t\venty-feven minutes. ·

To find this proportion, make ufe of the logifiical logarithms, as be-

The place of Saturn in the zodiac is twenty-three degrees thirty-eight
minutes of Aquarius, and I~ is declination t'\venty degrees t\venty'-four mi...
nutes fouth; no,v, as there is no table immediately for the declination of
Aquarius in this work,' yet as Leo is fituate oppofit_e Aquarius in the zo...
diac, it only requires to enter into the table of declinations under Leo,
with c'ontrary latitude, that is, north infiead of fouth, and it wil1 be
found to anfwer exaclly the fatne purpofe; for Saturn's declination, an-
fwerable to one degree -fix minutes north latitude, is t-vventy degrees
twenty-four minutes. 'I,o find the ~odiacal parallel anfwerab1e to that
declination, I exa111ine the firfi .column of declination in the tab]eJ under
·o latitude, and fee.k for tw,enty degrees twenty-four minutes; but, not
finding that declination in that .column, I trace back into Cancer, where ~
I fit?d it anfv;erable to t\vcnty-nine degrees ten minutes of that planet,
vv~hich fhe'\\TS that Saturn's parallel falls in twenty-nine degrees ten mi...
nutes of Cancer and ·Capricorn, and fifty n1inutes of Sagittary and Ge-
mini; and thefe points,·being equi-difiant frotn t11c. tropics, are called the
antifcion~, in page 142. ~ ,,
- In the fame manner is found the antifcion or zodiacal parallel of Jupi-
ter,' \vhofe place is tv.renty-nine degree~ fifty-five minutes ofTaurus, and
his declination nineteen degrees tnirty-nine minutes with thirty-five mi-
nutes of fouth latitude. But, as there is no table of declination for Tau-
rusJ that of Scorpio, being oppofite, mufi be entered under north, lati-
tude, which is equally the fame as having a table of declination for Tau-
rus, by obferving al\vays to enter 'vith contrary latitude; and feek in the
firfi column under o for nineteen degrees thirty-nine minutes, and it ~·iJl ·
give tw·enty-feven degrees twenty-fix minutes of Scorpio and Taurus for
Jupiter's zodiac~l parallel, and alf-o t\VO degrees thirty--four minutes of
Leo and Aquarius, as n1ay be found by the aforenamed table of an-
tifcions. ,
'
The pofition·of Mars in the heavens is in forty-four minutes of Virgo,
and his declination fourteen degrees fifteen minutes, 'tNith three degrees
t'vel ve·minutes north latitude. I enter the table of declination in Virgo,
under the column o; but find no fuch declination, therefore I feek in the
table of l.eo, in the fame column under o at the top, and find it points
to twenty-t'\\ro degrees t\VO 1ninutes of Leo and Aquarius, and {even de-
grees fifty-.eight tnihutes .ofScorpio and 1"'aurus; 'vhich give the z9diacal
parallel of Mars. .
,
T~e Mode. of finding the Sun's aJ?ti(cion, or zodiacal parallel, is exaClly
the fame as given by 1\.rgol and Morinus ; and the reafon is, becaufe the
Su.n never varies, but _always moves in the fame line throughout all. the
, hgns
t -
\ ,
0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y. .
flgus of t he zodiac. The antifcions of the Sun, therefore, fall in
t\velve degrees fcvcnteen minutes of Aries and Libra, and fevcntecn de-
grees forty-three minutes of Virgo and l)ifces.
The mode of afccrtaining the nntifcions or zodiacal parallels of Venus
differs· from that of the Suu, bccaufc Venus has latitude. The place of
Venus in the zodiac is five degrees t\vcnty-onc minutes, her declination
is eight degrees forty-fcvcu minutes, and. her latitude fifty-t\'10 m inutes
fouth ; and, as there is no table of declination for the fign Pifces, I take
the oppofitc fign Virgo, as before, ana feek for eight degrees forty..fevcn
minutes in the column \Vith o -on the top, and it \viii be found anfiver-
able to fcvcn degrees thirty minutes of Virgo and Pifces, and t\\·enty-t\vo
degrees thirty minutes of Libra and Aries; thofe places being cqui-difiant
from the t\VO tropics.
The antifcion or zodiacal parallel of Mercury is gained in the fame
manner as the former; his place being in t\venty-five degrees fifteen mi-
nutes of Aries, his latitude three degrees feventeen minutes north, and
his decliuation t\velve degrees fifty-t\VO minutes in Aries; but, as there
is no table for Aries, it is to be \Vorked by the contrary fign Libra ; but,
llOt finding in the colun1n of 110 latitude that degree 'of declination, f
enter the fign ·Scorpio, and find it anfwerable to three degrees fifty-five
minutes of that fign, and three·degrees fifty-five n1inutes of Taurus, and
t\Venty..fix degrees fiye tninutes of Leo and Aquarius.
The antifcion.or parallel of the Moon cannot in any cafe be directed,
fue having twenty-fix degrees forty-t\vo minutes of declination, and the
greatefi declinatio~ .of the,ecliptic is but t\venty-three .degrees tbirty-t\vo
minutes, and therefore there -can be no zodiacal parallel of the l\1oon for
d~rection•.

... latitude, fo muft their pofitions be taken; for·a ftar is faid to toitch the
horizon, by direeti~n, or by any other motion, "vhen it begins to leave

'The C!itnaaerical Years, 'as we have before 1ho\v:n, .are nothing
more ~han the times or periods in ~hich the l\1o'on makes her quarters,
or re..occupies the place the poffeffed at the titne of birth, ~eaiured by
h~r ovvn n1otion, and applied to the years of the . HC1ti~e's ~ Jife~ ·To ai:
certain the cli1naClerics of this nativity, no,te the ..e:XaCl: poii1t the Moon
occupied at the time of birth, ':vhich is. fixteen degrees. fifty-:-fix minutes
of C~pricorn. Refer to the Ephemeris calculatetl1
for tHe ryeat· in which

OF ASTROLOGY..
the native \Vas born, and obfcrvc \V hat length of time 01c took in con1inrr
to fix degrees fifty-fix minutes of Aries, which completed her lirft
quarter. It \\'ill be found that !he \Vas fevcn days eleven hours nnu
thirteen minutes in going that fpnce ; and, if \\'C al1o\v for each day•s
tnotion of the i\'loon one year, and for every t\\'o hours one n1onth, it
\Vill prove that the firfl: clin1aClcrical polut or year occurrc~l \Vhc:n the
native \vas fcvcn years five tnonths und ncar eleven d~ys old.
To obtain the fecond period, proceed in the fa1nc tnanner. Obfcrve
'vhat titne the Moon occupied in paffing fi·om fixteen degrees fifty .fix
minutes ~f Capricorn, her place at birth, to itc; oppofite ·point in the
zodiac; \vhich wili be founH to be fouJ1eCt) days eighteen hours and
forty-eight minutes;· fo that the na.tive mufi be fourteen years nine
tnonths aud t\Velve nays ·old, \Vben his fecond C}imacterical year arrived.
"The third qu:.irter of the l\1oon, \vhi~h produced the third clitnaCl-eric,
· falls in fixtcen degrees fifty-fix tninutes of·Libra; to \vhich point the
n1oved, fron1 he-r pJace at birth, in t\\'enty.:onc· days t\VO hours and thir-
teen minutes ; at \V·hich time the native \Vas t\vcnty-one years one n1onth
and three days old. The fourth ·clirnaCterical period took place \Vhen
the Moon cotnpleted her revolution in the zodiac, nnd came to her ra-
dical ·place ~t·the hour of birth, viz. in .. fixteen degrees fifty-fix minutes
of Capricorn ; \vhich revolution being formed in t\venty-feven days .
eight .hours and t"vventy-three minutes, proves the native to have then
been ·t\veuty-feven year:3 four months and ·five days old.
'The·enfuing clim~B:erics are found by adding the quar.tets progrcffive1y
to the firil: revolution. For infiance, if \Ve add the l\'loon~s firft quarter·
to ·the fourth, it \vill produce thirty..four years nine tnonths and t\venty-
three days, \vhen the 1ifth climacrerical period canie up. The fixth aHo,
by annexing the fucceeding quarter, \vil_I be found to take place -\vhen
th~ native \vas forty·t\VO years three months and fe\·enteen days old;
the feventh, \Vhcn he ·\Vas forty-eight years five months nnd eight days
old; and the eight-h and lafi: c1i.rnat1eric of l\1r."\Vitche1l's life, 'vhen the
Moon had Ineai\·ared t\VO COll1 plete revolutions, and had·returned a fccond
time0
-.to her radical place in the figure-; at \Vhi<:h periqd he ·\vas :fifty-four
years eigbt months arid te,n d~ys old.

J'hus the climacterical years are invariably:to be foun~ by the motion
of the rJoon, \Vhich is the Only true and rational Inethod; anJ is l1tni}ar
to that of critical days in difeafes; ouly .the tin)e is iu one ca!e n1eafktred

Hence it is apparent that the predominant humour- ofFending at birth
is phlegm, engendered of the cold and moifr affeCtions of the planets.
If we compare the. tefiimonies that compofe the -
temperature at the time
of conception, with the above, we ihall ..find that · the humour which
,vas then weak, is now firong; and that ~he hurnour w'hich was then
firong is now weak; :!o that, if we confider that the formation of the
native begins with conception, and is completed at the birth, and that the
fuperior temperatures then are the inferior now; and if we allot unto
each of the fignificators their fpecific qualities, and mix them according
to the exaa proportions they give, we thall nearly find a mediocrity of
humours in the temperatute of this native; but, as the phlegmatic
affection \.vill be found to haye the afcenden.cy.,_~he ·native \vill of courfe
mofi materially feel its atl:ion upon his confiitution, by becoming fub-
ject to a depreffion or finking of the fpirits, and other. difagre·eable
concomitan~s, which ihall be fully iJluftrated when -we come to' fpeak
~f the (lgnifica_
t,ors of ficknefs. Rut before. we l • difmifs the 1pr.efent
fubjeCt; it will ~be ·lleceffary to premife; that, ·if cold ·.and1 pioiftur.e

prevail in a gcniturc, the native \vill be phlegmatic; if cold a11d drynefs
. have the fupcriority, he \Vill at.:quirc a refcrved habit, and be oppre!fcd
\Vith mclancholy; if heat and llHJifiure predominate, he will prove of a
fanguinc tcmpcrnt~1rc, and of an even courte!ous difpofition; if heat and
drynefs, he will be choleric, and of a furly temper.; but, where the quali..
tics of the configurating fiars arc nearly equal, the native will be fl:rongly
affeClcd by their ternperaturcs refpcaively, \vhen under a direCtion oftheir
.0\'\'11 nature and quality.
.
The tctnperature being determined, ..we may with great eafe afccrtain
the con1plexion by the rules heretofore laid down. Libra and Scorpio,
being the figns afeending, give a fanguine complexion; but, in thi~ na-
~ tivity, not very f:'lir nor clear, bec~ufe oppofed by the oppofite effeCt of
Mars, ''cnys, and :the Ivloon; and b~caufe phlegtn :\vas the fuperabundant
quality in the temperature at birth; the mixture of thefe· feveral fignifi.. .
cators produce a fallo\v complexion, grey eye~, light fandy hair, with due
conformity in the other members ; to wbich defcription this native
~riClly c.orrefponded in.ev~ry particular.
. .
The foregoing judgmen.t will hola good in au·cafes where fimiJar
configurations are found. Let it be remembered, that only four difiinct
colours or complexions are .pr0duced, viz. black, white, red, and yelJO\V;
a'l others proceed frotn f1 mixt~re of thefe, and are afcertained oy affign-
ing to each fignificator its o\Vn -prope.r colour; then collect .the \vhole into
one fum, and according :tQ tht quality, .number, and force; of the (everal
tcfl:imonies, judi~-~opfiy incorporated with .e~ch other, will-the complexiotl '
be accurate!y found. Regard mufi :ho\v,ever be bad in all cafes to the cli-
m'!tc ~here the native is l?qrn; becaufe in fu.ch parts of .the earth \Vhere
th~ figns and_.fignificat~rs .have from their afironomical pofitions greater
force and .energy, they w.ill more vifibly affe&, and more fenfibly demon-
Urate .their influe~ce upon .the _
perfo.ns born under thein. This, I believe,
has been fufficiently detnonfirated in the introductory part of .·this
\Vork.

In drawing judgment from the foregoing premifes, let it be well
cot1fide'red, that, if two planets have equ'al dominion in the horofcope,
preference muft be given to him that beholds the afcendant moft ,par-
tia:lly ; but, if their ·configurations 'Nith ·the afcendant ihould be equally
dignified, regard the planet that is lord of ·'th~ houfe, in preference·..to
that which .has. -only his exaltation ·therein. Remember likewife, i.n

laid do~'n, as an efrablilhed maxim, that our enquiry in this particular
is chiefly to be governed by the Moon and Mercury, and by the other ..

upon the fcnlitive f~~t!lties of.the animal foul, will be apportioned tp their
ftrength of afpea, an~.-~will operate by the fame rot~tion in \vhich thofc

1haU ptefent1y thow; and .the.ir effeCt. will be found to vary, as thg
irradiati6hs are trat~sferced from one planet·to another. Fo' infiance,
wpen ~he Moon ..is direCl:e~ to- the•.terms or; afpea of th~ ~oft ' poten~

When there are no · planets to be found in t~e afce11dant, note ·what

nade with the Ivloon and Mercury; for whatever

the mental et)do\vments oft he nat1ve. But 1f no planet be 111 the afcend-
ant, nor configurated as above, then the lord of the afcendant fhall be the,
ftgnificat9r, provided his difpo(lto~ beholds him in fome ?odily afpeCl:_
; if
not, we muft have recourfe to-the planet. that moll: partially beholds. the
M.oon or Mercury; but, if no fuch he found in the figure, then the planet
which hath the mofr e1Tential dignities in the fign~. of Mercury or the
Moon, ihalllafily be taken as the fignificator from whence this judgmen.t
fhall be drawn. ... '
According to thefe rules I exari1in~ the preceding geniture. I find
there are no planets in the afcendant, nor in confi.gurati~n '" w~th t~e
Moon and Mercury ; and t~erefure .
I take Venus as ·the ~fig'nificator of
the nativ-
e's temper and mental ~difpofition; becaufe ilie is lady of the
afcendant, and is beheld by Jupiter her difpofitor. Ma(s alfo, being
conjoined with Venus in ·ruHng the afcendant, and in afpetl with his
difpofitor, will in a ·fecondary .~egree atrea th~ . native. The pofition
of Venus near the tail of the Sw~n, and thus .configurated, influences ..
the native to a purfuit after knowledge ; and being in tbe fifth houfe,
the houfe of pleafure, declares that he ."'ill_take much del~ght therein~
This fignificator being like'wife near "the Dragon's head; which partici-
pates of ·the nature of Jupiter, implies _a IJ:lild~ juft, and peaceable,
d~fpofition. : Being pofited ' in the houfe 9( her exaltation, proves his
den1eanou·r will gaii1 him ger1ei·al efteell? ; but being in a moveable fign,
ilio\vs him changeable in the objeCl of· his pur{uits. On ~the other
hand, Mars will abate much of the mildnefs and evennefs of his tem-
per indicated by Venus, particularly when ut1der 'a direB:ion of Mars,
at which times .he will be unufualJy peevilh, fretful, and paffiooate-
a circumfiance which this .native confeffes has been freque ntly verified,
when neither hitnfelf, nor anJ par.t of his family, could account for his·
aufrerity and change of ten1per; but w·hoev.er infpecrs his geniture by
the rules of this fcience, will fin"d it \¥as occafioned· by the oppofiti911

in the dignities of Saturn, it {ho\vs that the native \Vi 11 be attached to
the arts and fciences, and inherit a truly houcfi difjJofition.
. 'T'hus f:'lr \\'C have confidcred the configurations which form the
te1npcr, aud give the firll: bias to the n1ind, in the earliefi: fiatc of in-
fancy: but \vhat !hall be the re{ult, as they gradua1ly ripen into
tnaturity ; to \vhat (peculations they \vill be direCted, and to . \vhat
extent of pcrfeB:ion the native may arrive in mental acquire1ncnts and
ability; is determined by other confiderations. The intelJeCl:ual fa- ·
culties, in ALL geuitures, are under the all:ral influence of l\1crcury
and the l\1oon; ~1ercury governs .the ratioual and animal fpirit in the
brain, but the vegetive fireugth of the brain is folely under the power
and dominion of the l'vioon; therefore, \Vhenever \ve infpeB: a i1at~vity,
and find thefe fignificator's \veil aff~cted to each other in terms and
afpect, \Ve may iafely conclude that there is a proportioaablc harmony
and modulation in the rational ·intellect, ·and in the other members
\vhich contribute. to a fertile . genius, and to il:rong natural parts. But
\Vhen thefe fignificators are ill affected, and in quartile or oppofition to
each other, it is altogether as fure a prc.fage of a dull c.apacity, and a
n~rrow contracted mind; particularly· if Mercury be combufr, flo\\" in .
motion, cadent, or peregrine, or affiitl:ed of the infortunes, 1nore
efpecially of l\1ars. And thus, the more l\1ercury is affiicred or iin·
peded in his own proper nature, the more \veak and !hallo\v \Ve al\vays
find the ·mental endowments of the native. In thofe genitures \vhere ·
Mercury is occidental, and in no afpeet \vith the l\'1oon, or \vith any

Let us apply this reafoning in ou~ confid~rations of the prefent ge-
niture; in which we find lVIercury and the Moon, the. grand patrons
of mental ability, are favourably fituated with refpea to. each other.
I:Iere is a remarkable reception bet\\reen Me·rcury and Mars, the joint
rulers of the afcending fign; Mercury polfe!fes the dignities of Mars,.
and Mars the exaltation of Mercury.: Thus the fignificator of the teLn-
. per and faihion ot the mind,. and the· patron of .fenfe, are mutually
conjoined in ~he fame influence;· an4 befpeak not only a difpofition to
fearch after literary acquirements, but prefage a fit capacity to receive,
· and·an under:O:anding capable of digefring, them. T~e Moon likewife
fends her fefquiquadrate ray to Mars, frotn the dignities of Saturn, and
.in the terms of Jupiter, '"hich declares the· favourite, purfuit of the
native ihall be .after fcientific knowledge; and, as the pofition of Mars
is ·fo highly elevated, .it is evident 'that his endeavours !hall not only
prove .fuccefsful, but ihall be manifefted in an eminent degree:. We
have alfo a perfeCt fextile afpeB: of Mercury and Saturn; which adds a
frrong retentive memory to a folidity •of mind, whereby. the early pur-
.fuits of the native are impelled for\vard, and ripened into maturity,
under··the united funcrion of reputation and prof!t. Thus the fignlfi-
cators of the temper, _quality, and mental enqowm~nts, of this native,
\vhen drawn into one focus, teftify, according to the approved rules of
this Scienc~, an acute penetrating wit, an enlarged underfranding, ~a
retentive memory, and a firong predilecriotJ. for fcientific ~ knowledge;
\Vith a folidity of tnind, and a confiftency A of manners, ~ell adapted· to
give vigour and ·fuccefs to {u~h purfuits. That tbefe gifts ,\rete fe- ..
verally and refpeBively verified in the. perfona1 qualifications, purfuits,
and preferments, of the native, the united tell:itnony of all his friends
and relatives will nQt only ·prove, ' but the fatrs \vill hereafter be more
mi~1utely efrablilhed, when the refult of each-'"a'fpetl cotnes to be ex-
amined and explained, un~er the various direCtions by·which thefe events
'vere refpeClively brought to pafs. ··· · · ~ j ~
;
· Hence it. \vill be feen, that Mercury, in this judgment, and in a11
cafes where relation is had to the faculties of the ·anitnal {~ul, is. to be
mofl: attentively confidere~, and his influence and operation regarded, ·
in proportion as ·rbey are configurated or mixed 'with the ray"s of other
planets. The importance of.this enquiry, ii1 the invefiigation of every
geniture, 'induces me to repeat to the.· reader, the neceffity of bearing in
mind t~e obfervations I have written on this fubjetl, .fron1 p. 428 to

ti1ne is pofited in one of his O\vu houfes, in any of the t\velve figns
except Pifces nnd Scorpio, take for granted the native will inherit a
aood undcrfianding, \Vith a capacity adapted for almoft any employment.
But if·this happen~ in an airy fign, and the planet fwift in motion, it
denotes perpttual \Va vering, and great in£lability of tnind. 2. ~1erc;ury
in conjunCtion of the l\1oon, in any and in every fign, denotes inge-
nuity of mind. The f:·une effeCt, though in a fmallcr degree, is given
by the fextile or triangular rays; but, in this cafe, the fextile is
al\Vays to be preferred to the trine. 3· 1f there be found a conjuntl:ion
of l\1ercury "'ith Venus, or Jupiter, or the Dragon's head, in Gemini,
Libra, Aquaries, or Virgo, it befiows an excellent genius, and a tnind
qualified for invention and itnprovement. 4· If Mercury in Aries be itt
reception ~Nith Mars, the native will be fubtle, deep, and fagacious.
5. ~""he Moon in conjunCtion with the Dragon,s head or tail; denotes
alert aud ntlive fpirits, \Vith a promptitude for fcience; particularly
\Vhen increafing in light, and near the fulL 6. Mercury in receptio1t
of the Moon, and the planets ..in any figns, gives an afpiring genius,
and an active volatile difpofiti~n. i. When Mercury is belo\v the
horizon, in fuitable figus, he inclines the n~tive to fcientific kno\vledge.
If in an airy fign \Vell fortified, it give$ freedom of fpeech, with firong
oratorical abilities. 8. lf Mercury be in conjunCtion \Vith Saturn,
and _Saturn well dignified, the native acquires a grave and a fober habit,
accotnpanied with a profound judgment, and folid underfranding. 9· If
in conjunCtion· \V ith Jupiter, unaffiiB.ed by any malefic ray, Mercury
befiovvs an excel~ent capacity, fet off with an eafy elegant addrefs, and

this, that it aftonilhingly enlarges a good natural underfianding, and
puts a fuperficial glofs over the defonnities of .a 11aturally bad one, but,

CONSIDERATIONS refu..Iting from t~e SECOND HOUSE.
I
- The principal judgmen.t drawn from this part of the o-enethliacal
figure, is· that which regards worldly riches and preferment~ or rather,
whether the native fhall be buoyed up upon the \vjngs of profperity, or
plt'!nged by adverfe .Jlars, into ' the depths of adverfity. ·- This fpecu-
latlon has been juO:ly confidered one ·of the moft important of the fcience;
but on all hands it tnufr be admitted the nrft amongfi the enquiries of

thofc, \Vho \vilh to kno\v the outline of their future fate. For this
rcafon, I !hall be as copious as poffible in blending theoretical v.tirh
praCtical examples in the elucidation of this enquiry, \Vith the humble
hope of enabling every attentive reader to derive that information from
his o\vn Jabours, \Vhich delicacy, or cxpence, tnight prcc]udc him fronl
obtaining in the cull:ornary \vay.
·0 n cxatnining this iigure, I find, Mars and Jupiter arc the prin1e
fignificators of \vcalth and profperity, becaufc they have do1ninion over
the fecond houfe; and the Moon, and the l)art of Fortune, are co-fig-
nificators of the native's fubllance. Finding there are no planets pofited
in the fccond houfe, I examine what configurations are formed \vith
the foregoing ·fignificators, and what afpeCls irradiate the fecond houfe.
Mars hath do1ninion in the tenth, the houfe of honour aud preferment,
aud is in reception of Mercury, \Vi thin the tern1s of that planet; an
argument that the native fh.all profper under fuch purfuits as are pe..
culiarly \Vithiu the dominion of Mercury, viz. offices of public trutl,
literature, or fcience. This dcduEtion is ~Jfo corroborated, by the united
tcfii1nony of the Part of Fortune in the tenth, ~ith thofe royal fixed
ftars I-Iydra aud Cor Leonis;· and Mercury's trine afpetl falling in
the L"lme degree, proves that an advantageous and reputable emolument
lhould flo\v through this channel. This judgment ~ has been confinned .
in various infiances; but in no11e fo confpicuoufly as in his appoint-
ment to 'the 1nafi:erlhip of the Royal Acaden1y in his l\1ajefiy's Dock-
yard at Portfmouth, \vhich appointn1ent refulted-not from the good
offices of "friends at court,"-but folely frotn the progrefs and improve.
ments he had 1nade in the mathematics.
Thefe propitious configurations are nevcrthe_lefs itnpeded by fome
latent malefic rays 'vhich hang upon his horofcope. The Part of For-
tune,. other\vife fo happily found, is afflicted by the moil: baneful a{:
- pett of Saturn, namely, his oppofition; at the 1ame tin1e tbat he be-
holds the fecond honfe \vith a quartile ray. ' This in uo thape leffens
the mental faculties, nor impede.s the fuccefs protnifed under the bril-
liant endo,vments. of I\1ercury; but it fho\vs, that, ho\vever fuccefsful
the native might be \vith re1peB: to pecuniary advantages, yet that his
income fhould pafs from hin1 in an i1nprovident- n1anner, and the pro-
duBion of his labours never accutnulate to an amount equal to his
merit. This is further illuftratcd and confirmed by the oppofition of
Venus and 1\fa~s, the fi~ni.ficato~s of his perfot1 and poffeffions. I alfo
find the Moon IS near the qua'rttle ray of the Sun, a bad afpetl, and
a frefh tefiimony that the native \viii ·not accumulate or lay ·up tnuch

of the ~oods of fortune. This,~ ho\veve_r, is in fotne m~afure abated
by the 1nterverition of the Sun, -which beholds t~e fecond houfe \Vith
a-favourable trine; and the codfiguration of ·Mars \Vith .the Moon, is
a -further declaration in his favo·ur. Jupiter, we find, bath dignitiesI
in.the fecond houfe; but being in the e..ightb, i,n the face of Saturn, 1vvith
latitude ·in Gemini in his detrimeJ1t, pla.inly indicate~, that at cert~in ,
periods of his life, when under the _
influence of evil directions, the native
thou!.d experjence divers diffic.u1ties and embarraffments .in money-con-
cerns. But \vhen tvve dni\v into ope view the.number of planets that,
dignify his birth, and are elfentially fortified; ~-hen w.e confider the ex~
cellent rece.
ption .<?f l\'lercury an~ Mars; the Sun it~ exaltation, fend-
ing a trine to the fecond; the Part ·of Fortune in conjunction. with etni-
nent' fixed fiars, exalted ,in the midheaven; we fhall find them fo·many
ci~·cumfiances to prove, that, notwithfianding the oppofition of tnalefic
rays, the native \\'ill be upheld through all the difficulties and vicifii-
tudes. of tnoney-n1_
atters, and eventually acquire a ~competent and liberal ,
in,come, fuch as fhould afford all the r~al co!nforts of humai1 life, and,
with ib:iCl: ceconomy, provide a b~ndfotne patrimony.for his defcendants.
But the afiral inclination · of th_is native· is not .favourable. to penurious
or . mercenary practices. The bent of his mind is influenced by too.
·much liberality and generofity pf principle, either to vvithhold his purfe,
or ·v1ithdraw the comforts of humanity, \\·here friendfhip or charjty
demanded thetn. Thofe 'vho knew him~ cannot but jufiify the truth of
the obf~rvation ;. and he has time anq often acknowledged to me, upon
.my remarks 'on his nativity, the ftraits he has experienced, by itnprovi- '
dently parting vvith his tnoney, and fupplying the ~mergencies of friends;
as is ~educible f~om t.he face of ~is geniture, by contemplating the feven
errattcs, and thetr ·a~ctdent_al pofitions. \ _ ..
.,
For the further inforn1ation of tl)e reader, it will be ·proper to re-
mark, that in giving judgment upon this quefiion, 've are not confined
to the pofition of benefic ftars; , for it frequently· happens tbat Saturn
and Mars giv:~ advantage and profperity to the native, \Vhen lords. of the
fecond houfe, and \veil configurated with the lutninar.ies, and the other
fignificators. So like\vife eminent £xed frars· in good places of the figure,
well qualified, and conjoined with benefic rays, give increafe of pro-
fperity and riches. But· if the tvvo ma'lefic planets,' Saturn and Mars,
ocCllPY angles in the figure, and the benefics are pofited in fuccedent
houfes, it {hows the nat'ive will experience adverfity jn the early part o.f
his life, bt~t profperity in the end; The Part of Fortune conjoined
with the Dragon's head, hath nearly the fatne effeCt as with Jupiter~
and predicts an. increafe of wealth. Sat~rn dignified ,in the eighth ~

forcllto\vs coufifcation of· property, bankruptcy, and r~iu. When the
Part of Fortune is confederated with violent fixed fiars, in evil places
of the figure, it prefages lo{s of fubfiance, and great poverty. .To de-
tennine ·the mode by ,~,hich thefe events fhall happen, or ho\v fub-
ftance or profperity vvill be acquired; \Ve are to regard the nature and .
quality of the houies over \V hich t!Je fignificators have dolninion. Thus,
if the lord of the eleventh houfe give virtue and influence to the fignifi-
cators of fubfiance by propitious rays, \Ve arc to conclude, that the na.
tive w-ill receive an incrcafe of \vealth through the medium of relations
or friends. But, if the lord of the feventh be thus irradiated,. his fub-
fiance will be increafed .by marriage, partnerlhip, or fome joint·concern.
And thus ju~gment is dra,vn in all cafes from the nature of the houfes
\vhich the feveral fi·gnificators govern or irradiate.
To obtain a proper idea, not only \Vh~ch \Vay riches and profperity
are likely to cotne, but to deci~e alfo \vhether they fhall be obtained by
)awful or difllOilOUrable means, we 1nufi: note \Vhether the benefic pla~
nets are fignificators; and if they are not afHitl:ed by the malignant rays
of Saturn or Mars, n<?r in conjuriClion \Vith any violent fixed ftar, it
fho,vs the native will acquire eminent profperity by fair and honourable
means. But if a malevolent fiai· be ·figuificator, and the beneJic p1anets
in no afpect \Vith him, and either retrograde or combufi, it induces the·
oppofite effect · If a beneiic plauet be fignificator, and placed in the
dignities of either of the n1alefics, jt iho\vs wealth \vill be obtained both
ways. 'T'o knovv \vhether riches, \vhen obtained, \vill be durable or
not, \ve mutl: confidct: \vhether. ~he ~gnificators are fo pofited in the
heavens, as to be unimpeded by the intercourfe of the maletics; for
then profperity ihal1 continue during life. But if the benefics are fig-

time when thefe things fuall feverally come to pafs, can only be known
by equating the diretlions of each.afJ.?eCl, which is the only true and ra-

CONSIDERATIONS refulting frotn th~ THIRD HOUSE.
The third hQufe difcov.er~ by. the afpeCts ~ith which it is configu-
rated,' \Vhether we:.fhall be advantaged.. or injured by the confanguinity
of. brethren, or l?y inland journeys and ·fojournments; which we have
fully explained in p. 290, &c. The fignificators of brethren or tifrers,
are .taken from five degrees preceding the cufp of the third -houfe, to
\vithin five degr~es of the cufp qf the fourth houfe. And the lord of
the t._qird houfe, or the planets accidently pofited therein, !hall be the
fignificators. We are then particularly to remark the pofition of Mars,
which i& the general fignificator of brethren,--or the Moon, which te- ·
prefents fifiers. _. If Mars or the Moon· be .found in fr1fitful fig.ns, or
in good· afpeB: " 7
ith the fruitful planets, \vhich are Jupiter~ · Venus, or
the Dragon's head, it is an argument that the native iliall have brothers,
.if the l configurations ~ate made \Vith l\1ars ; Or fifiers, \\'hen made \Vith
the Moo11 ;' and the number fhall be according to the irradiations and
force of the. afpeCts. If a good and benevolent configurarion is formed
between _
-the lord of the aicendant and the lord of the third houfe, jt
implies mutual good offices, hannony, and concord, bet\veen brothers
· and Gfiers; but, if bad afpetl-s are found, then vice verfa, malice, hatred,
envy, a.nd ill-vtill, exift among them. vVhen Jupiter, Venus, or the
Dragon's head, a~e pofited .in the third houfe, the native wi~1 derive ad-
va.ntage from tr~ve:I, or · by change of habitation; and will be ·aided by
the.good fello\vihip of his o\vn fatnily.
.
To determine thefe quefrio~s in the prefent nativity, I obferve that
Capricorn bas the principal ·rule in the third houfe; w hieh being a ftgn
not very prolific, but rather .inclined to barrennefs, I1conclude ther~
at:e fmall _expeCtations of bre~hren. Th~ Moon's pofition in the third,
houfe declares there will. be a :fifier, or ·perhaps two; which is further
demonfi:rated by the fextile ·ray of Venus; but, being at the-fame time
under the.maljgnant influences of Mars, jt :lho\VS that what might be
produced by the fruitful influences !hall. be cut off by premature death;
and ·indeed, the Moon being in- an evil afpeCl: with the Sun, and ap-
proaching to a quartile with Mercury, is no argument of durable Jife to
· . fifiers.

fificrs. As to brothers, \\·e have not a finglc tellin1ony to produce
then1, Mnrs, the natural fignificator of brethren, is pofited in a barren
ftgn, and in no rrood afpefl. with any Flanet, except in reception of Mer-
cury~ which op~rates not in favour o fruitfulnefs, becaufc he alfo is po-
fited in a barren fign. 1'he1e are argun1ents to prove the native \vas the
only ron, or at leafl the only one that fhould cornc to maturity, or engage
in the vici(Iltudcs or concerns of this life.
'Vith regard to the inland journeys of this native, hi~ fojourn1nents,
or chan~e of refidence, they are declared to produce an increafe of profit
and Iubtlance. The Moon's pofition, unaHliEled, in the tHird; and Ve-
nus in fextiJe, having her exaltation in the fifth, denotes many journeys
that Ihould 1~roduce p1eaf~re or profit, and lbmetimes bot~, if! an emin~nt
degree; as 1S further evtnced by the planet Venus betng 1n recepuon
of Jupiter, the fupreme lord of the fecond, the houfe of profperity
and fubHance, as 'veil as lord of the fifth, the houfe of pleafure and de-
light. And, as the third houfe is unaffliRed by any malefic ray, or b)~
the pofition of the infortunes, or any evil configuration thereJn, it re-
mains evident, beyond contradiction, that he lliould receive no injury
by means ofbrothers or fiflers, nor any difadvantagc from travel or change·
of rr.fidence.-This has alfo been remarkably verified in the perfon of
the native, v;ho hath uniformly changed his fituation and refidence for
greater profit and preferment.
CONSIDERATIONS arifing.frotn the FOURTH HOUSE.
From this houfe we obtain judgement of the native's he.reditary ac-
~uifttions; the fubfiance he lliall derive fron1 his father; his houfesJ·
lands, hereditamenLc;, &c. in \vhich 've are particularJy to obferve, 1·..
the fituation of the lord of the fourth houfe; 2. the pofition of the Sun
in a diurnal, and of Saturn in a noaurnal, nativity; and, 3· '":hat plat1et
or planets are configurated in this houfe. Ifthe major part of thefe fig-
nificators are found. flrong and 'vell dignified, under benefic influences,'.
it is an argument of much good fron1 the father; but, if otherwife,.
contrary eflefu 'viii be produced. So the lord of the afcendant1 or the
Moon,. in fex.tile or trine \rith the Sun by day, or ,\·ith Saturn by
night, forefbe\Vs unity and concord bet\veen the native and his father;
ana, if the afpea be made \vith reception, it \Vill continue unto denth,
and lead to an inheritance of the father's fubflance. The fame effe& is
produced by the lord of the afcendant and the lord of the fourth houfe
in mutual reception ; and again, if the lord of the afcendant be in good

aipeC1: 'vith the lord of the fourth ; or the Moon apply bl benefic rays
to the lord of the fourth ; the!e are {}rang arguments o concord be-
t\veen the native and his father, and of advantage by_ inheritanc~. But,
if contrary afpcEls goYern this houfe, the native and his father will be
at e~mity '"rith each oth~r ;_ ~nd. the more ferio~s ~~d aff~i~ing ~·iii this
ennuty be, and the tnore 1nJunous to the natives Inheritance, tn pro-
portion as the fignificators fhall be in adverfe pofitions, ill configurated,
void of reception, or afiJicled in the angles. 'fhis rule invariably holds
good in all genitures. . · . ... ·
On the cufp of the fourth houfe of this nativity we find almofl: feven .
degrees of the fign Aquarius, and Saturn in dignities pofited therein, in
fextile with Mercury. Thefe are teUimonies of longevity in the father.
as \\rell ~s of Hrong mental endowments, and of refpeclability among ·
mankintl. : We find Saturn difEofes of the Moon; and Mars, who is
·lord of the afcendant, cafl:ing a fefquiq uadrate to the Moon, in reception
of Mercury, declares the native {hould be regulated by a firong filial
affcCt.ion for his fater, and that in a more eminent degree than the fa..
ther for the fon. This is confirmed by SaturJ?., fignificator of the father,
being the fuperior planet, in a mafculine fign, and the fignificators of the
native being inferior, and in feminine figns.
J
As to the father's riches, they mufi be deduced from the afpeas of
the benefics to the fourth houfe, and the pofition of the part of fortune,
and the planets in the fifth houfe, which is the father's houfe of rub-
fiance. · Now Jupiter being in quartile of Saturn and in no afpect
with ·either ()f the luminaries, are arguments that the father fhould not
increafe his fubftance; and, as the part of fortune 'is in oppofition to
Saturn, it declares he fhould tneet with many loffes. · And, although
Saturn is eli~ibly pofited in the fourth, and ·might thereby promife an
inheritance of"landed property at the death of his father ; yet, as the part
of fortune is in oppofition with Saturn, in the terms of Jupiter1 and
Jupiter configurated \Vith violent fixed fiars, it is clearly demonfirated, ·
t})at, through the eafe and freedom of the father's difpofition, accom-
panied with fon1e heavy loffes, he fhould at his death leave but a fmall
patrimony for the fon, which fhould happen at a very advanced time
of life ; as is predicted by the pofition of Saturn in the father's afcendant,
which invariably gives · old age1 particularly when pofited in his o'vn
dignities. Theie circumUances precifely happened both to the father
.and the foa.

CONSIDERATIONS rcfulting from the FIFTH HOUSE.
.,
The [peculations upon this houlc afford the tnofi fatisfaaory informa-
tion concerning the native's iffue-whcther he fhall have children; to-
gether with th~ir conditions, q~alitie_s, and. fcx: Alfo, '''hclher the
native fhall dcrtvc any fucccfs fro1n lpeculattvc nfk of property, fuch
~1s buying and felling in the funds ; adventuring in the lottery, or con-
fi gning goods to the uncertainties of an unkno,,·n foreign Jnarkct.-
Thefc fcvcral enquiries are definable from the figure of every gcniturc,
and are Iought out from the configurations in, or relating to, the fifth
houfe; and, as they are not of the Jeafl irnportancc atnong the various
occurrences incident to human life, I fi1all lay down fomc 1elcEt: rules
for the more particular information of fuch of my readers as \rilh to re-
duce the theory thereof into praaice.
To kno\v \Vhether the native !hall have if[ue or not, particular regard
mufi be had to the configurations in the firU, fifth, and tenth, houfes;
and alfo to the afpeas formed by the lords of thofe houfes; as alfo the
eleventh houfe and its lord, becaufe it is the fifth from the feventh.
If thcfe fi~nificators are in fruitfu_l figns, then it is certain the native
,vill have itfue; but, if they are in barren figns, the contrary effetl \'till
be produced.
But, as it feldotn happens that the planets are \Vholly pofited in thefe
oppofite extremes, I fhall fiate the eHea of thole configurations ,,..hich
are cafually formed, and 'vhich lead to a full explanation of all the
others. If the Sun, Saturn, or l\1ars, rule the afcendant, fifth, tenth,
or eleventh, houfes, 'vithout fome fruitful afpetl of the benefics, they
deny children. So Saturn in the fifth, or the Sun ih quartile to Jupi-
ter, will be found to "'ork the fan1e barren effea. If the Sun l1e con-
figurated with Saturn and Mercury in the eleventh or fifth, in afpea
w1th the Moon, it {hews the native ~ill fcarcely have children; or, if
he {hould, they ,vill die fL~ldcnly, in their infant fiatc. The fiune
planets conjoined in the midheaven, and in quartile or oppofition of
the ~'loon, produce the fame. Venus pofited in the firfi or feventh
houfes, in conjun&ion or oppofition of Saturn, or in con1tnunicative
dignities, i.e. lie in her term, and fl1e in his; or if Saturn be in Taurus,
and Venus in Capricorn; it argues barrcnnefs in a n1ale geniture, and
abortion in that of a fe1nale; or that '''hat is produced {hall die ere it
has feen the light. In like manner Saturn, if pofited in the afccndanr,
,-,,ill produce barrcnne[~, or dcflrov the oHspring. So 1\~ars in opl?o-
{itton

AN ILLUSTRATION
fition of Jupiter or Venus deflroys the.hope of iff~e in the native; and
Jupiter in ?PPo!ition ~o S'aturn defiroys vvhate~~r ts produced under it,
more efpectalfy tf Juptter happens to be lord of the fifth. But the moll
decifive teflimony of barrennefs, is wl1en the lord of the·fifth and the ]ord
of the afcendant are combufi and retrograde, unaided by benefic rays, and
the Moon in detriment. ·
If, on the contrary, the Moon and ~{ercury are pofited in the fifth
houfe, and the~r difpofito~s u~affi_iEted, it is an argument that .the na-
tive fhall have dfue. So hkew·tfe tf Mercury be oc~tdental, and tn good
afpeEt to Jupiter or Venus, it produces children; but if oriental, and
affliaed by Saturn, i~ denotes barrenne{s. The Moon configurated with
Venus or ·
the Dragon's head in the fifth houfe, and a prolific fign on
the cufp thereof,-is a certain proof of many chilaren,. and good. And
again, Jupiter in trine afpeEt of the Moon~ in moifl: figns; or the Moon,
With Jupiter or Venus in an angle, or in good afpea with the angles,
declares the fame ; and that they will be ·born to ·preferment. When
the!e fignificators fall ~·holly in m_afculine figt!s;· the iffue fhall be all
males; but, when they fall wholly in fen1inine figns, the offspring !hall
be all females. Again, if the major part of thefe fignificators falltn maf-
culine figns, arid the refidue in femintne, the native fhall have moH. boys·;
but, if the n1ajority be in feminine figns, and the rcft in 1nafcuJine, then
will he have tnofily girls.
' I
. The number of children the native Chall have is determined by col-
~eEt:ing the number of tefi:imonies by which they are produced ; for the
n1ore fruitful planets that are found in the fifth or eleventh houfes, and
in fruitful figns, give the tnore children; whereas, the fe\ver the planets
are that \\"e find poiited in thofe houles and figns, the fewer children will
be produced ; and this is a never.failing critenon whereby to judge. Let
it alfo be remembered, that fruitful planets in bicorporal figns produce
double, and in fruitful figns treble, the number. ·
The readieR and moll accurate way of determining the native's iffue
i~ to co_
llea all the te!limonies of fruitfulnefs and Herility that appear
on the face of the geniture into one table~ as in the foregoing juage-
ment on the temperature and conHitution; and, according to themajority
of fi.gnificators, let the enquiry be decided. If the fignificators and figns:
of Herility exceed iq number and energy the fignificators of. fecundity,·
the native cannot have iffue. If thefe tefiimonies happen to be equal,
then regard mufi be had to a good revolution and direB:ion meeting to-
gether; and, iffuch fhould occur, without any malefic influence, it may

fc1fely be pronounced that the native will have one child. If thcfe rules
arc duly attended to, the reader \Viii find no difficulty in obtaining fatif.
faaory information upon this important enquiry, in his ow·n or in any
gcnethliacal figure that is laid before him.
According to the rules I have recommended, I fi1aiJ invefiigate the
gueHion in this nativity, reducing the particular quality of each figni-
fJca.tor into a table, and deducing frotn thence the effeRs they refpcc-
tively give. Upon the afccndant there arc t'vo figns, both of v.'hich muft

And there.fore, as the indifferent figns operate neither \vay, I conclude
from the above majority of ·fix fi~uitful fignificators, that the native fban ·
have fix children. 1~he next thing is, to detern1ine their fex, or how'
maD-y fhall be n1ales or females. To do this, it only requires to
afcert'lin the qualit:' of the figns ..an·d planets 'vith vvhich the ~1oon is
con'figurnted, -'Nhethcr ·n1afcnline or feminine; and froin thence judlT'..
n1ent is 'dra,vn. For cxan1ple : The ~loon, in this geniture, is the fi:h.,

line. The l\footl is ·fefquiquadrate .afpetl: with Mats, in quartile of

nies of the mafculine confortnation, that I pronounce the firft iffue with
which this native fhhll be blelfed will be a fon.-And fo it happened.
To demonfirate the fex of the fecond child, I re-confider the figure.
I firid the Moon is t~e princir.al fignificator of the fecond child alfo, be- \
caufe fhe fends a fintfier fextlle to the fifth houfe, as well as a dexter rex-
tile to the flrfi. Adopting therefore the -fame node as before, I dedu~e
two a~~ments only in favour of a female ; but in favour of a maJe I
again·ffnd aconfiderable-majority; the Sun, Mercury:, Jupiter, and the
Mobn's no~th node in the £fth, beihg all firong te;fiirnonies that the.

therefore impregnates that quality; the ~Ioon, a feminine planet, be-
holds the Dragon's I-Iead fro•n a fen1ininc fign ; all '\vhich prove the fc-
Ininine nature {hall form the quality; and hence it is certain that the
three laH children of this native !hall be all girls.-And fo it really
proved:.
'This account may appear miraculous to thorc unacquainted \Vitlt
planetary influence; but their aaion is certain, and their energy invari·
ably the fame. Thus the grand Projctlor of the univcrfe~"continually
produces, by perpetual revolutions of the cclellial bodies, the fame
caufes and effe&s, giving life and motion to all animated nature, and
vegetative nourifhment to the inanimate; and, as the inanimate are fame-
times found imperfealy wrought, or mixed, or blended with their op-
pofite qualities, or of a doubtful genus; fo we find the animate are fub-
Jea to the fame mixtures and affetlions, according as the planets fhall be
configurated under which they are formed. And hence we confiantly·
find, that, in the generation of the human fpecies, if the mafculine influ-
ence hath greatly the majority, the perfons produced under it will be pro-
portionably Rrong, mufcular, ra\v-boned, and mafculine ; but, when it
hath barely the fuperiority of the female influence, the native is effemi-
nate, weak, flender, and diminutive. So likcwife females, '~here the fe-
male conformation hath greatly the afcendancy, are mofl delicately and
charmingly formed, with all the grace and foftnefs of the fex, and \vith
due fymmetry and proportion ; bq.t, \vhere it hath but barely the pre-
Qotninancy ·over the mafculine, it fails not to produce large, coarfe,
~·aw-boned., m.afculine, wo.m~n. And, as ~"-"C have before fully explained,
1f the mafcultnc and fetn1n1ne configurations are fouJ!d equally Hrong at
the time of birth, if the aaion of the one quality fhall tn no '\'ife ob-
tain predominancy over that of the other, but the degrees of po\ver and
dignity fiand equally baJanced, and neither the mafculine nor feminine
influence preponderate, then fhall the tpf-111; a.~ooJl..,.,, or the hermaphrodite,
be produced. ~
From the fifth houfe \\·e are alfo enabled to form a tolerably correEl
judgn1ent, '"hcther the children born to the native fhall, in a general
\vay, be fortunate or unfortunate in their journey through life ; btJt, as
thcfe children arc all living, and gro,Yn up to maturity, delicacy requires
that I fhould be filent on that head. I would at the l:·une time recom-
nlcnd to every perlon, before he decides pofitively upon the events pre-
diCled by the llfth houfe, fo f:1r as they relate to the general characters
and purfuits of chadren promifed to the native in any gcnethliacal ~gun~,
to c9nfult the radix of each child's birth, and compare it v.'ith thole of
the parents, by which means the artifi can never err.
By
AN ILLUSTRATION
By the fifth houfe "'e are like\\rife enabled to judge of the probable
event of every fpecies of adventure, 'vhether by lottery, dealings in the
funds, purchafe or fale of life-annuities, or of any tranfaB:ion \vhere a
certain or definable rilk is to be fuHained : for thefe [peculations, hov...-
ever varied or n1ultifarious, are governed by the fame motions .of the
tnind, and fpring from the fame effea in our radical geniture. In the
prefent fi&ure, 'Ne find the north or fortunate node of the Moon pofited
111 the fift.ll houfe, 'vhich is a Urong argument of fuccefs in fuch enter·
prizes ; and this iuccefs is firengthened by the ·Moon's fextile afpea
there,vith. But \\·e dare not, in any cafe, decide by one fpecies of evi-
dence, \rithout confulting \vhat n1ay be offered on the contrary fide.
\Ve therefore find, that, oppofed to the foregoing propitious tefiimonies~
there are feveral that produce a very oppofite effea. Jupiter, \Vho is
lord of the .fifth, and fignificator of the native's adventure, being pofited
in the eighth houl(; defiroys tnuc}l of the luck promifed by the forego-
ing afpea; and, as !v1ars is in direCl oppofition to Venus, and the part
of fortune affiiaed by Saturn ; at the fame ti.me that the Moon's un-
fortunate node, or Dragon's Tail, falls in the eleventh, the houfe where
the final end of all things is detennined; we Jnay fafely conclude, that,
tho~gh the native might occafionally derive advantage by fuch fpecula..
t.ions1 yet he \Vould eventually be injured by them.
' - \
CONSIDERATIONS refulting from the SIXTH HOUSE.
"
From the fixth houfe we deduce thofe infinnities or confl:itut1onal dif-
orders of the body, with which the native, from the particular quality
of the ruling planets at birth, lhall from time to time be affiiaed, as
the feveral direaions !hall happen to come up. This houfe likewife has
relation to the goad and evil occurrences that refult from our ilnmediate
iervants or do1neHics ; and like,vife from our cattle.
But the mofi elfentiat information the inquifit1ve reader can wi{h to
acquire, is that 'vhich regards the health or ficknefs of the native, and
wh1ch, fince the days of 1\.dam, is the promifc~ous lot of all God's
children. lnfirtnity both of body and 1nind were unquefiionably oc-
cafioned br the fall, which hurled,. as·it were, the 'vhole f.yHem of na-
ture into oppofite extrernes: and ·gave that jarring inequality to the ele-
ments 'v·hich lays the foundation of every radical diforder. For,
as thefe elen1ents are more or lefs predominant in conception1 and as
they are diverfely changed .and modified by the forms and properties
of the planetary Influence at the ti:ne .of birth, fo will the incidental
occurrences of health and ficknefs be, according to their fpecific quality
and temperature; and this is definable from the temperament an~ coin·
plexion
0 F
plcxion of the native ; for, as his temperature is, fo fhall be hi~ licknef!i
or his health; for ficknels is no other than an inequality of fosne pre..
dominant hu•nour offending at the tiJne of birth; and, of v:hatcver
clement fuch predominant hutnour is cotnpoundcd, of fuch nature and
quality 'vill be the difeafe. lienee then the propr iety of every phyfi-
cian's confulting the radical caufc of clifeafcs frotn the gcniturc of the
patient, \vhenev<:r it can be obtained; for, by uniting uranical and phy-
itcal precepts together, there cannot be a doubt but life rnay oftentime.')
be prcfervcd, where it is fatally defl.royed through ignorance or n1ifiake
in the radical caufe of the con1plaint. Indeed the ctninent progrefs,
and unbounded fuccefs, of the learned and ingenious Dr. Salmon in
the fcience of phyfic, he confe!fes to ha,·e derived frotn aflrological
kno,vledge in decun1bitures, by 'vhich tneans he feldotn or ever lofl a
patient, but ··Nhere nature \Vas totally exhauUed, and the fprings of life
fairly at an end. A very proper example this, Jor tnodern praElitioncrs
to follovv ; fince not only fortune and fame, but the general good of
n1ankind, \vould flow from it.
In the hope that many of rny readers vviH be defirous of acquiring
the mo{l extenfive inforrnation in this part of the fcience, I fhall here
Hate the various configurations from \Vhence the caules of ficknefs and
health may be deduced; as \\rell thofe 'vhich \\"ere felcacd by Dr. Sal-
mon in the courfe of his practice, as thole ~'hich I have added by my
O\vn experience. The fuojeR is interefiing, and deferves attention.
...
If, in the figure of birth, the lord of the fixth houfe be in good afpeft
'vith the lord of the alcendant, it is a Hrong argument that the nati\'e
will be healthy. So when the Moon 'is \veil aignHied, and in good
configuration \Vith the lord of the fixth houfe> or beholds the culp of
the fixth \vith a fextile or trine, it is another proof of the native's health.
V\'hen benefic fiars are in the fixth houfe, in good configuration \Vith
the luminaries, or \Vith the lord of the afcendant, it further dc1nonflrates
a healthy conHitution. If the lord of the fixth, the cufp of the fixth,
or the !vloon;be unaHliC1ed by bad afpeas of Saturn or ~Iars, or by fixed
Stars of their nature, or by the Dragon's Tail; and neither the lord of
the ftxth nor th'! 1vioon be combuft or peregrine, the native ,,·ill mon
probably live in perfetl health all his days. . .
.
But, on the cont~ary, if mofi or all the fignificator~ in a genefis l?e
found '"e~k and unfortunate, or affiiaed by the malt~nant planets u1
body or afpea ; or if moH of the fignificators politea in the t\\~el fth,

afpeEl of Jupiter, Venus, or the Sun, or M_?on; the ~ativ:e's body will
be very infir1n, and become a perfea rep?htuin ?f dtfeafes. And ac-
cording to .the nature ?f. t~e figns .in \Vh1ch. thoie plan~ts are po~ted,
'i.e. accordtng to the tnphctty, fo wtll__ the native b~ conunual_ly affitaed
\Vith fuch infirmities as proceed fr?m the predominant <luabty of. that
trigon; for, if the fignificators b.e tn watery figns, .he wtll be affiiae~
~ith phleg'?; if i~ earthy, he vvtll .be ~p~r.effed wtth .n1~lan~holy; tf
tn fiery, w1th choltc, heat, and fevertfh affett1ons ;~ butJ ~~ tn atyy fi gns,
he will labour under molt or all of thofe complaints whtch an{e from
too great an abundance of blood~
\t\'henever we find in a nativity the lord of the afcendant applying to
the lord of the fixth, it declares, the native will be inattentive to his
/
o\vn health, and often fuffer thereby. The Sun in the fixth, feventh,
eighth, or t\Velfth, houfes, is an argument of fhort life, of many and
bitter aHliaions, and of much ficknefs ; particularly if in bad afpeB:
' \
7
ith the Moqn ; but, if thefe luminaries be in conjunction of each other,
it prefages defea of . underHanding, and afflictions of the head and
brain, which the phyfician can neither difcover nor cure. If the Moon
be affiitled by the quartile or oppofition of Saturn, or the Dragon's Tail,
in the firft or fecond houfes of the figure, it declares the 'vhole life will
be infirm; and, if fixed Stars of the quality of Saturn be joined Vv"ith
either of the luminaries, the native \viii be always lean and puny, and the
food he takes 'v-iii afford but little nourifhment; fo like·wife he that hath
Mars elevated above Saturn in his birth will be of a weak and fickly ha-
bit ofbody.
If Ma1·s be in the fixth houfe, it gives fudden cafual difeafes, which
return upon the fligheft. occafion ; if in the twelfth, he amias the
body with extreme weaknefs, and forebodes cafual misfortunes. So, if
an infortune be matutine, it ilie\VS fudden diieafes or falls; if vefper-
tine, a fickly habit or durable complaints. But, fince bodi1y infirnli-
ties cannot be deduced intirely frotn the bare pofition of any one planet
\vhen others of an oppofite nature and quality are fo fituated as to coun-
terbalance its influence, Io the foregoing obfervations can only hold good
in fuch nativities where ~ey fiand implicitly as above defcribed, ¥lith-
out any other planet in confio-uration, and totally unimp~ded by the in-
fluence of other r~ys; for, \V~en thefe occur, the complaint arifes from
a compound ccntfe, and every feparate quality tnuH be confidered, and
compared with the fundamental fignificators of the temp~rature and con-
Hitutio~ of the native i.n his radical figure of birth, which, being duly
afcertatned, and proved by diretiion, 'viii ieldom fail to point ou.t the
precife nature and tendency of the. ~i!eafe.
The

rfhe four triplicities, fr01n \Vhence the four COtnpJexions or tClnpc-
ratUrCS arifc, and the Hgns \vhich colnpofc them, 1uufl be fully con-
tcrnplatecl in this enquiry. If the native l.Jc found to exceed in his
tctnperaturc or cornplcxion ,,·ith the choleric humour, and Saturn
happens lo be the afiliCling planet, and pofitcd in Aries, being the houfc
of 1V1nrs, and the exaltation uf the Sun, he then declare-, the native fhall
at tintes be troubled \Vilh melancholy vaJ)ours, and itnpollhun1CS in. the
head, \Vith colds, \'{atchings, Hoppagc in t 1e Homach and bo,,~els, difltiJa..
tion~ of rhcurn, and pains in the anns and fhouldcrs. lf Jupiter be the
afl1i8:ing planet in 1\.ries, he denotes fotne afflitlion iu the head, or
quinfcy in the throat, or uunorous r\\?e11ing, \4
:tth fainting or r,\·oon-
ing. lf Mars in Aries be the affiiEl.ing fignificator, he gtvcs extrcrnc
p~1n in the head, arifing fron1 a hot caufe; or elfe want of flcep, or hot
rheutns in the eyes, or gripings in the bo,vels. If the Sun be the arTliEl..
ing planet, and pofited in Aries, he then gives the rnegrin1, refllcifnefs,
fore eyes;, \\7
ith pain or f\\l'ell ings in the thighs and hips. If Venus be the
aHliaing planet, and in Aries, fhe produces heavinefs and dulnefs in the
head, proceeding of cold; and difpofes to lethargy, and to complaints
of the kidneys and reins. If l\1ercury be the aHltcling planet in Aries, (~"
he caufes the vertigo, or lightnc(~ of the head, '"?ith all the various dif..
orders of the ~vomb. If the ~! oon be the affi1Eting planet in Aries, fhe
gives defluxions of rheurn from the head, falling licknefs, convulfions,
din1nefs of fight by cold, Ileepineis, 'vith pains or lan1enefs in the knees.
Thefe fev~ral con1plaints are peculiar to the fituation of each of the
planets ~·hen in the fign Aries ; for, in each different fign, they vary
their effeEl upon the conflitution, by participating in the nature and qua-
lity of each of the figns refpe8:ively. It will therefore be neceffary to
trace their influence through each of the four triplicities, before their ac-
ticn can be precifely dete~tnined in every geniture.
Saturn in Leo, being the affli8i.ng planet, gives Yiolent affiiaion of
the nerves, conlt1mption, or 'vaHing of the liver, debility in the reins,
and \veaknefs in the back. lf Jupiter be the aflliB.ing fignificator in
Leo, it difpofes to feverifh contplaints, pleurify, pu.tns in the in-
tefiines, gripings, and 'vind cho!ic; and the fciatica, or hip-gour..
\'\'hen l\1ars is the aHlict;ng planet in Leo, choler abound~, ,~·ith a vio-
lent fever, pains of the Hon1ach, or kidncvs. If the Sun be the ~nliEl.­
ing planet in Leo, it gives the putrid or {potted fever, Hone and gra\'el,
fainting fits1 excruciating- pains in the head~ almofi- to tnadnefs. If
Venuct atfliEl: the native in Leo, it induces the violent fever of love..;
gi\·es obflruEtions at the H.omach,. \rith pain or h'r·elling in the l~gs. If
!Vlcrcury afllicl in Leo, he gi\'es fadncis. of heart, trembling~, pan1s i!l
the

the back, vvith la1nenefs in the arms, and pains in the extrcn11t1es.. If
the Moon atHiEl the patient in Leo, fhe gives fickne{s at Hotnach, in-
crea!es the king's evil, and all diforders of the throat.
...
In Sagittarius, if Saturn be the affliCting planet, he produces weaknefs
of the extremities, confumptions, pains in the Jegs and feet, at1d the
.gout. If Jupitei; be the fignificator of affiiRion in Sagittarius, he pro-
duces putrefatlion of blood, fevers procet=>d1ng fr.o1n choler; pains and
I\veJlings in the knees, and tutnours in the· head and neck. lf l\1ars
.affiia in Sagittarius, he gives the fciatica, or pains in the hips or thighs,
.dryne(q of the mouth, 'vith extreme heat and forenefs of the throat.
If Sol affii& in Sagittarius, it caufes choleric humours in the thighs or
hips, the fifrula, f~inting fits, and !ickne[~ at heart. If Venus be the
aHiiaing planet in Sagittarius, fhe produces the 1ciatica, corruption of
.blood, fur.feits, and ficknefs of Hoo1ach. If !vlercury amitt in Sagitta-
·rius, '\Ve fuffer pains in the back and reins, pains in the kidneys, coughs
.and floppage of urine. If the Moon be the affliEling planet in Sa-
gittarius, fhe induces \.veaknefs or Jarnene!s jn the thighs, pains in the
bowels, and the \vind cholic. 'I'hefe are the various cornplaint~ 'vhich
the planets give in the fiery triplicity, which is under the denomination
.of choler, and is compofed of the three foregoing figns. I fhall nO\V
flate the affliaions which arife from the pofition or the feven planets in
the earthy triplicity, ,vhich confifl:s of the three figns ..faurus, Virgo,
and Capncorn.
If Saturn be the affiiaing planet in the fign T·aurus, he gives the
king's evil, or malignant fore throat, quartan ague, obflruaions of the
fiotnach, the fcurvy, and melancholy affeaions. If Jupiter be the
affiifl:ing planet in 'raurus, it produces the quinfey' or r\velling of the
throat, rheumatic gout in the hands and arms, wind in the blood, ob-
flruElions in the bo\vels, with pains and gripings. If Mars be the
affiiC1ing planet in 1~aurus, he occafions tumours of the neck and throat, _
weaknefs and pains in the back, the fione in the reins, or a confump-
tion. If the Sun afflia in 'I'aurus, it endangers the quinfey or fore
throat, and gives pain and fwelJing in the knees. If Venus be the af~
flicting planet in 1'aurus, fhe produces a catarrh, or fome malignant hu-
tnour in the throat, pajns in the head, colds, and defect in tlie fecrets.
If -
Mercury aHliC1 in Taurus, he caufes ditlillat1ons in the throat, and
'vheefings in the Hon1ach, the fciatira, or lan1enefs and numbnefs in the
..feet. . lf the ..Moon be. the affiiaing planet in 'faurus, {he. oc~afions
fwelhng a11d lorenefs of the throat, canker in the mouth, pa1ns tn the
legs, and gout in .the fee.t..
If

If Saturn be the aHliCling planet in the fign Virgo, he occafions vio-
lent obHruaions in the bowels, \Vhich frequently end in mortification,
and tcrrninatc life; he like\vife produces laHitude and weaknc(s in the
thighs, floppagc of urine, and the flonc. If Jupiter be the afllitling
planet, and po{itcd in the fign Virgo, he occahons putrefied and cor-
rupted blood, cold and dry hvcr, obfiruRions of the lungs, confurnp-
tion, \Vcaknels in the back, pain and feeblenefs in the joints ; and, in
\\·on1cn, fits of the mother. If Mars be the aflliEling pltlnet in \'irgo, he
often occafions the bloody flux, or a confinncd dy{cntcry ; allo obHruc-
tions in the circulation of the animal f1 uids, and dilarders in the legs.
If the Sun be the affliaing planet in Virgo, he gives the bloody flux,
or choleric obHruB.ions in the flomach and throat, or {orne [,veiling
tumours therein. If Venus afiiia in Virgo, fhe produces worms, ,._.jnd..
cholic, flux, pains at the heart, or illnefs proceeding from cold taken in
the feet. If Mercury aHliB: in Virgo, he gives the bilious cholic, fhort-
nc{s of breath, obfiruClions at the fiomacb, pains in the head, and dif..
orders of the brain. .If the Moon be the afHiEting planet, and fituated
in Virgo, fhe gives all kinds of obfiruClions in the bo,veJs, Io,vne!s of
fpirits, de~p. melancholy, fudden tremors, fainting fits, and 'veaknefs in
the extremtttes.
If Saturn be the affiiEling planet in the fign Capricorn, he gives the
gout in the knees, legs, and feet; alfo pain in the head, and obHrutls
the circulation. If Jupiter be the affiitling planet in Capricorn, he
produces melancholy blood, and running pains, or fon1e obfirutlion or
floppage in the throat. If rviars be the atfliaing planet in Capricorn,
he gives violent pains in the knees, with lamenefs, and alfo in the hands
and arms, 'vith hot f\vellings, and violent tutnours. If the Sun be the
affiif.ling planet in Capricorn, he gives fw·eiiings in the knees, \vhit]o\vs,
diH.emper in the bo\vels, 'vith fever, and morti~cation. If Venus
affiiEl in Capricorn, Ihe produces fcrophula in the l<nees and thighs,
tumours or [,vellings in the tefiicles, debility in the reins, and coldnefs
at fiomach. If Mercury be the affiiaing planet in Capricorn, he gives
the gout in the feet and knees, occafions fioppage of urine, palpitation
of the heart, and violent heart-burn. If the !\1oon afflitl in Capricornt
fhe gives the gout or whitlow in the knees, pains in the back and reins,
Hone and gravel, weakne!s of the kidneys, and the \vhites in ,,·on1en.

If Saturn be the affiiaing planet, and pofited in the fign Gen1ini, he
gives 'pains in the arms and !boulders, pleurifies, obfiruaions in the
bowels, melancholy, and blac1< jaundice. If Jupiter be the affiiB:ing
planet in Getnini, then blood 'vill abound, and occafion pleurifies, and
diforders of the liver and reins. If Mars be the affliaing planet in
Gemini, he often occafions breal<ings out, boils and blotches, pains in
the arms, heat of blood, putrefaaion, the !lrangury, and other com-
plaints in the fecrets. If the Sun afflia in Gemini, the native will be
iubjeCl to fcorbutic . con1plaints, corruption of blood, and pefiilential
fevers, with weaknefs or larnenefs in the legs. If Venus be ~he afflia-
ing planet in Gemini, {he corrupts the blood, and brings on a dropfy;
fue al!o produces the king's evil, and fome difiillations .of rheum from
· the head, affiittino- the extre1ne parts. If !VIercury affiiEl-in Ge1nini, it
produces windy bfood, 'veaknefs in the arms, pains in the head, and the
rheun1atic gout. If the Moon aflliEt in Gemini, {he brings the gout
in the hands and elbows, alfo in the legs and feet. Thefe complaints
are all peculiar to Gen1ini.
If Saturn be the affiiEi:ing planet in Libra, it argues a confutnption of
the bpdy, weaknefs in the oack, firangury, corruption of blood, the
fciatica, and gouty or rheumatic pains. If Juptter ·be the affiiaing
planet in Libra. it occafions the dropfy, tumours in the groin, the piles,
fjHula, inflammations in the legs, fevers, and forfeits. If Mars be the
affiitting planet in Libra, he gives the fione and gravel, violent pains in
the k~dneys and bladder, fevers, and pains in the feet. If the Sun be the
affiiEiing planet in Libra. he produces choler, pains in the backJ fharp-
nefs of urine, univerfal corruption and inflammation of the blood, with
laffitude in the arms, {boulders, and extremities. If Venus affiiB: in
Libra, fhe gives a \Veaknefs in the reins, debility of the animal func-
tions, diabetes, pains in the bo\vels and head, with the bilious cholic.
If Mercury affiiEt in Libra, he gives pain in the mufcular fylletn, oc-
cafions fioppage of urine, faintings and palpitation of the heart, ob-
flruaions in the throat, decay of the lungs, or phlegmatic f\vellings in the
hreafi. ·If the Moon be the affiiEling planet in Libra) fhe debilitates the
reins, gives pains in the back and bo\vels, produces a diabetes, or brings
on the 'vhites in wom.en. Thefe are the feveral cernplaints engendered
under Libra.
.
If Saturn be the affii&ina planet~ and pofited in AquaTius,. he gives
pains in the head from melancholy vapours, fwellings or gatherings in
the throat, pains and cramps in the limbs and joints, pains in the ears,
and deafnefs. If Jupiter be the aflli8:ing planet in Aquarius, he pro-
duces running pains all over the body, particularly in the hands, arms,
legs,
0 1• A S 'f R 0 L 0 G 'I. 725
legs, and feet. If Mars uc tl1c affiitling planet in Aquarius, he beget&
putrcfaEl.ion and iunarntnation of the blood, f\vclling in 1he legs, obOruc-
tions in the Uotnach, pl~urify, or intcri)littcnt fever. if the Stu1 be
the affiitling planet, at1d .ih Jo'lquarins, it occalions lcHncne(c; and foul
eruptions in the legs, dilliculty in 1noking \Vater, t.tnd \tJafiing of lhe
reins at1d kidneys. If Venus be the afflicting planet in Aquarius, {he
caufeth gouty or rheurnntic htin\ours in the knees and feet, and fornc-
timcs in the fiomath ; btlt, if lhe blood be in a putrefied fiate, fhe \\,.ill
cnufe the drop(y. If 1\'Iercury be the aHlitling planet in Aquarius, he
gives fluxes, and wind in the bow~ls, running pains in the extremities,
and fwcllings in the feet and legs. If the ~loon be the aflliCling planet
in Aquarius, the produces dropfy ih the legs, fits of the mother, dia...
betes, weaknefs in the Harninu, univerfal laffitude, tuntiings of the i·eins,
and itnpotency. Thefe are engendered of the planets, \vhert male\rolently

caJtfeth .bad digefii.ot1', I?fs of.apr.e_tite, futfeit with v0mitting,.an univerf~l
corruption of blood, and pa1ns tn the back and bowels. If Mercury 1~
~he affiicl~t1g pl~n~t, ~nd in Cancer, he declares a cold fioin~ch; grip-
tngs of wtrtdi d1fitllauons of cold rheum, or fome cough, 'vtth lame-

incident ro the fetzen planets, "'hen prornittors under Cancer.
If Saturn be the. planet a:ffiiaing in the fign Scor.pio, he gives the
piles, fifiula, and tumours in the groin, gout in the legs and feet~ ob-
!lrutlions o~ the nerycs, gid~ine(s, and palfy. If Jupit~r ~e th~ aillift-

matter from different parts of the body 1n lar.ge boils or blotches ;
otherwife it brings on obflruaions in the fiomach . and bowels, fup-
pr~[fion 9f urine, or the bilious choli.c. If Venus. b~ the ~ffliEt~ng planet
in Scorpto, !he produces the. dropfy, fcurvy, kings evtl, patns of the
kidneys, running of the _

to barrennefs, with obfiruaions in the ftomach and bowels, ftrangury,
and extreme pain in. the back and reins. If Venus be the affiit.1ing
planet in P.ifces, fhe produces a cold w~tery fto·mach, white fwellings
in t~e knees or legs, flux in the bowels, which terminates in a dyfentery.
If Mercury be the affiiEl:ing planet in Pifces, it occafions weaknefs and
laffitode in the ·bowels and reins, with running pains or fwellings in
the knees, legs, or feet. If the Moon be the affiiaing planet in Pif-

But, as it does not ahvays happen that the afcendant, or the part of fortune-,
is the giver of life, nnd a finglc planet at the lan1c tirrle promittor, in
\vhich cafes alone the foregoing rules can. invariably b~ adrni.tted, iL
\Vill be neccffitry to dcanonllratc the other tnfluences, Wlth 'vhtch the
~regular enjoyment of health is impeded by (ickncf.4i and difeale. It is
the more ncce!Tary to be copious in this fpcculation, fincc 'vc cannot,
without a perfca l<nowledge of all the configurations that induce fick-
nef~, either afcertain the aHliaions to 'vhich the nati\'e {hall be
fubjec1: during his life, or difcovcr, 'vith any degree of accuracy or
fausfaElion, the temporary and curable difordcrs, frotn that lafi nnd
final n1alady, \vhich baHlcs the fyflem of phyftcal aid, anrl difunites the
immaterial foul from the corruptible body. In all difeafes, the Ivioon
is tnore particularly to be regarded, fince her aaion upon the body is
n1ofl: fenfibly felt," and her contiguous pofition brings her more fre-
quently into contact \Vtth malignant rays. I !hall therefot-e demonfiratc
the various configurations, under \Vhich {he tends to dellroy the natiYe's
heallh or life, if affEaed by the malefic rays of Saturn or·~1ars, in Iiis
figure of birth. .
If the Moon in Aries be affiiaed by the conjunaion, quartile, or
oppofition, of ·Saturn, the native \viii be remarkably fubjeEl. to coughs
and colds, impofihumes in the head, weaknefs in the eyes, difiillations
of rheunl in the breafi, [\veilings in the throat, loathtngs in the no-
mach, vvith irregular and profufe perfpiration. But if tne affiiRion be ·
by the conjunction, quartile, or oppofition, of Mars, it caufes diforders
of the bratn, violent fevers, refl:leffne!s, inflammations of ~he liver, and
phrenzy. If in Leo the Moon be affliaed by the evil rays of Saturn,
it produces a violent fever, putrefaction of the blood, heat and drynefs
in the Homach, \vith laffitude and debility. But, if the difeafe comes
by the affitaion of Mars, fl~gnation •of ~he blood, lofs of appetite,
phrenzy, the putrid or· fpotted fever, \Vtll be the confequence. If
the Moon be thus corrfigurated \Vith Salurn in Sagittarius, tt produces
.a defluxion of thin, fharp, and fubtlc, humours, gives pain in the litnbs
and joints, with heat and f\velling in the extretnities, refulting from
the advcrfe effefts of heat and cold. But, if the afHiElion comes by Mars,
it \Vill produce violent fickncfs at flomach, intermittent fever, pains in
the reins and loins, inward and out\vard piles, and the fiflula. Thefe
rlifeafes arc produced by the malefic afpects of Saturn and lVlars 'rith
t.he Moon, in the fiery triplicity.
If the Ivioon be aH1iCled in l·aurus, by the quartile, oppofition, or
con~nnEtion, of Saturn, it indicates flow fevers, proceeding fron1 burnt
No. 36. 8 R choler,
·
728 1\. N, I L L U S T. R A T I 0 N
choler; and obHruB:ions of the arteries, w.ith inflammation of the \\·hole
body, and exulceration of the lungs. But, _if the diforder proceeds from
the quartile, oppofition, or conjunt1ion, of Mars, it will rife from a
fuper-abundance of foul blood, inducing various obftruB:ion.s of the body,
inflammations of the neck and throat, pains in the head and limbs, with
watchfulnefs, and convulfive fpafms. If in Virgo the Moon be thus •
affliEled of Saturn, it occafions crudities and indigefiions of the· fiomach,
tough phlegm, obfiruB:ions of the bo,\-els and inteflines, head-ach,
pleurify, and heat of urine.. But, if the affliB.ion be by Mars, it de-
notes an exulceration of the inteH.ines, bloody flux, putrid fever,
loathing, retching, and violent ficknefs of the Il:otnach. If in Capri- ,
corn the Moon be affiiEl:ed by Saturn, it Chews fubtle, cold, and thin, ·
diUillations, pains and obftruaions in the neck and breafi, inflamma-
tions of the lungs, with difficulty of breathing. But, if the Moon in
Capricorn be affiiaed by Mars, it prefages illnefs arifing fr:om bad digef-
tion, . or from fome choleric or acrid liumour in the ilomach. It may
Iikewife produce a fever of the nerves, ulcerations of the throat, and
fluxes of the fiomach ·and belly. Thefe are the affiiaions peculiar to the.
Moon in the earthy ·tripli~ity, when impeded by the malefic rays of
Saturn and Mars.
. .
In the airy triplicity, if the Moon in Gemini be aHiiaed by the con-
junB:ion, ·quartile, or oppofi tion, of Saturn, it inclines the native to a
confumption, to diforders of the fpleen, wearine(s, ·w·atchings, 'vith
flow fevers, pains all over the body, particularly in the joints and ar-
teries. But if the affiiB:io·n be by the n1alefic configurations of Mars in
. Gemini, it produces vi0lent fevers, dangerous obfiruaioris of the blood
and juices, irregular pulfe, 'vith ficknefs and loathing. If in Libra the
Moon be affiiaed by Saturn, it gives difeafes of the oreafi and fiomach,
pain in the head, 'vant of appetite, loathing of food, noaurna] fevers,
hoarfenefs, coughs,·and diHillations of foul humours. But, if the evil ir-
radiations are from l\1ars in Libra, it occafions a faper-abundance ofblood,
inclines to putrid fevers"' breakings out, or inflarnmations of the whole
body. If the M.aon in Aquarius be afHiRed by Saturn, it occafions
languor, depreffion of fpirits, nervous affeElions, \Vatchfulnefs, and an
univerfal relaxation of the nervous fyfiem. If the affiiElion come by the
coil afpeas of Mars in Aquarius, it portends difeafes which arife from
hot and !harp humours engendered in the fiomach and bowels, and
eventually produces agues, intermittent fevers, exulceration of the
liver, and fometimes mortification of the bowels. Thefe are efpecially
under the airy triplicity.
In the watery triplicity, the Moon affiiaed in Cancer, by the quar.:.
tile, oppofition, or conjunction, of Saturn, indicates diforders refuJting
from
0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y.
frorn violent colds, to 'vhich the native '~ill be remarkably fubjea ; it
\viii likc\\'ifc occafion diflillations frorn the brcafi and lungs, tnoifi ca-
tarrhs, afiluna, hoarfencfs, and obfiruclions of the bo·wels. But, if the
afllitl.ions arifc fron1 the malignant configurations of Mars, it gives fan-
guinc cornplainls, hard tough phlegn1 in the Horr1ach, pains in the head,
retching, iickne(c; of the Hornach, and putrid fever. If the !\1oon in
Scorpio be aflliacd by Saturn, it fore01e\VS ulcerations in the legs and
thigh~, fillula, the piles in ano, ,,.-ith painful furprcHion of urine by
Hone or gravel. But, if the afili&ion be of I\1ars in Scorpio, it fhe\vs
violent pains in the head, \Vith ulcerations or impoflhun1es; as it likeYr'ife
gives the hemorrhoids, 1ncallcs, fmall-pox, fpottcd fever, thrufh, chick-
en-pox, biles, and all bodily eruptions. If the Moon in Pilccs be af-
flicted by Saturn, it produces difiillations of cold rheum, flow fevers,
pains of the back and loins, mortification of the bo,vcls, and fpeedy
death. But, if the evil come by the affliElion of Mars in Pifces, it fhe\VS
an abundance of gro(c; humours, violent eruptions in different parts of
the body, fuddcn fevers, cpilcpfy, flagnation of the blood, fainting fits,
and apoplexy.
Thus I have fiated, in as brief a manner as poffible, the v~rious d1f-
eafes produced by the Moon in e·ach of the t\velve figns, \vhen impreg·
nated 'vith the malefic afpeas of Saturn or Mars; and here let 1t lie
underUood, that nearly the fame effeCls arc produced by the quartile,
oppofition, or conjuntlion, of l\1ercury \\.,ith the Moon, as by the fore-
going configurations \vith Saturn, and the {arne by the rpa1efic irradia-
tions of the Sun \Vith the !"Ioon, as refult from the evil influences of
!vlars. . I fhall now point out the particular dilorders occafioned by
the coil afpecl of Saturn and l\1ars with the Sun:
If the Sun be affii&ed by the quartile or oppofition of Saturn in fiery
figns, he produces the megrim, laffitude of the body, quartan agues,
and confumptions. In earthy figns, cholics, cancerous tutnours, rheu-
lnatifm, and gout in al1 parts of the body. In airy figns, madnefs, phren-
zy.fevers, fplcnetic melancholy, and violent nerYous fpafms. In \\·atery
figns, agues of all forts, feurvy, leprofy, king's evil, and gout.
If the Sun be aHliEled by the quartile or oppofition of Jupiter in fiery

.
'ro judge accurately of the natural force of a difcafe, great regard ·
mufi be had to the figns· \Vherein the ftgnificators of the difcafc are
pofited, both as to their nature and quality; for earthy figns denote
colder difeafes than air.y, and fiery figns hotter and drier difeafcs than
\Vatery. And hence diforders might \vith eafe be fought out by duly
confiderin·g the nature of the figns, the dig~ity of the ·configurating
planets, and the quality of. the houfes in \Vhich they are pofit~d. In this
fpeculation it muft be al\lvays remembered, that the houfes of heaven
'vhich denote difcafes, are the fixth, t\velfth, eighth,. and feventh.; and
particular regard muft be had tO the Jords of thofe houfes, as \VeJl as to
rhe planets pofited therein, in acute difeafes; · and to the Sun and lord
of the afcendant, in chronic. .But the fixth houfe,. and ·its lord, \vith
the planets pofited' therein, heft rlefcribe· the difeafe, particularly when
th~y affiiet either of the,luminaries or the lord of the afcentlant. The
configurations of the l\1oon are in a particular manner to pe noticed ;
for, in the confiitution of difeafes, fhe tranfiates the nature.of one planet
to that of another, the which, if well examined, \vith the fiate and.
quality of that planet 'vhofe virtue !he tranflates, cannot fail to difcover
to us the true caufe of the ficknefs or .difeafe \vith \vhich the native is
afflicted. For according to the fign the Moon is in, .to the nature of
that planet to \vhich .lhe applies, and to the fign that planet is in, fo the
difeafc !hall correfpor.d in nature and .quality to that planet, tvhether it "?
be a fortune or an infortune.•.n1afcu1in·e or feminine, noCl:urnal or diur-
nal, hot ·or cold, dry or n1oifi; and the fame !hall be reprefented of the

oriental or occidental, combu!l: ...or free, precifely ·fo !hall. the firengrh
and ·duration of the n1alady be. And in this ·e~ql!iry it 'vill become ~ us
to dillinguiili \Vhether the affiietion be ·effenttal . or · accidental. 'fhe ·
parts of 'the body ·effentially affiieted, .a~e · governed by t·he fign upon
.. the. afcendant, ·the cufp , of the fixth boule, and the Moon·; thofe acci-
dentally affiided, are governed by the lord. of .the .afcendant, the lorJ of
· the fixth, and the Moon; and by the figns in \Vhich they are pofited,
both according to flmple and compound fign.ification. 'Ihe difference
bet~vcen the elfentiar and a-ccidental affiittion_. is this : the one de-
1nonfirates ·\vhere the root of the difeafe lodges, and .where the chief
and real affiiCl:ion is feated,; whilft the other iho\vs the fympathetic
affiietion ~ of t.he =
component pa~ts,. \Vhich, .though in fa~ ·really \Vell,
yet ~uffer art ~cute and !enfible pa~n, by r~fon o~ . th~ extretnity of the
diften1per wbtch effenttally or radtcal1y affitCl:s fotne other parr. For ex-
.ample~ when one bur~s his :hand; t.hat is-rhe~mem~er or part eiTentially
vitiated; but, ~by reafon of the,extremity of the pain, the \Vhole arm be..:
con1es inflatned. Thus the difeafe accidentally affeCts the \Vho.le arn1;
but it is effentially feated only in the burned hand. 'fhe fame reafoning
holds good in all cafes generally; but particularly ·\ve £1y, that Saturn
in the beginning of Cancer produces pain in the left fide, as though
pierced with an . 3\Vl; in Leo he affiitls the heart and back; in Virgo the
head and bo\vels; -in ~corpio, the hips and reins; .and caufeth difficulty
in making water. So .Mars, .lord of the .fixth, \vit h l\ries or Scorpio on
the afcendant, affiias the head; though this pofition frequently gives
p~in. in all parts• of ·the human body, and produces a_
n univcrfat breaking-
out, in boils. blotches, ulrers, itch, fmall pox, n1eafles., or the like. But,
if Mars in this cafe be pouted in l .eo, ·he produces pains in the back;
in Virgo, inflammations of the lungs; in Libra, pains in the back and
reins; but, if he be lord of the 1ixth in -~corpio, he gives,ddorders of the
'vomb and bladder.
' -
If the ·lord of the fixth houfe be affiicred in a ·diurnal fign, the difeafe
'\Vill appear in the fore part of the·body, as in the face, breaft, or belly;
but, if he be afllieted in a nod:urnal rfign; the feat of· the difeafe \Vill be
either in. the bac.k or internal parts of the body; and t.his will hold good,
\Vhether the fignificator. be above or under the earth. If the lord of the
fixth houfe be afflicted above the earth, and in a diurnal -fign, the lick~
nefs falls in the right fide; but if he be under the earth·. and in a noctur-
nal fign~ it falls in the le~t _fide. Mafculine p~anets alfo afflict the right
fide of the body, and femtntne the left;_accordtng to the fpecific parts of

\vifc be rcgnrdcd; in proportion to the firength of their rays, \vhcn fig.
nificators of diJcafc. 'l'hus Snturn of hirntelf produces thick, gro[c;,
n1clancholy, nnd fu perfluous. phlegm; and rules the receptive virtue
\vhich rcfis in the body nnd fplccn i 3nd bath this naturJl energy doubly
~ugmcnted, \vhcn pofitcd in 1"'aurusJ Virgo, or Capricorn. Jupiter's
natural influence is heat, blood, and \Vind i therefore his virtue is cref-
ccnt, gro\ving, and quickening; nnd is featcd in the liver. l-Ie governs
the dige!livc faculty in man, and hath his po\vcr much augmented
'vhen poficcd in Gen1ini, Libra, or Aquaries. 'fhc humour producctl
by Mars is hot, !harp, and choleric; he therefore induces anger, and
governs the attraCtive quality in man, having his po\ver much incrcafcd
\V hen in Aries, I,~o, or Sagittarius. The Sun engenders yello\V choler, .
hot and dry i he governs the vital faculty, and is the beginning of life
and motion. His action is upon the heart; and 'vith- i\1ars he rules the
attractive quality, having his po\ver greatly augmented in Ar_ies, Leo,
and Sagittarius. .Venus produces ·thin phlegm, cold and moill:, governs
and excites the libidinous appetite, and \Vith ~Jars and the Sun pre-
fides over the attraCtive quality, having her grcateft energy in Aries,
l.eo, and Sagittarius_. Mercury engenders thin n1~lancholy, hot. and
dry, hath the virtue imag-inative and cogitative, and difpofes the animal
virtue rcfiing .in the brain. The Moon prolluces grofs, ra\v, crude,
t)hlegm, prefides over the natural virtue rcfiing in the liver, and governs
the cxpuilive faculty, having her greatefi power and .influence in Cax:tcer,
Scorpio, or }lifces.
From thefe obfcrvations \Ve are led to deduce, that, when the planets
in t~eir effential dignities are pofited at the fame time in any of the
above figns, the O.peration of the planet fo e{fentially dignified \Vill fo
far exceed the_influence of ·a11 the other ·fiars, ·as to render its tempera-·
n1ent and quality too po\verful in the confiitution -of the native, and to
produce fuch diforders as are the natural ·confequence. For example,
if Jupiter be thus dignified . in Gemini, the digcfiive faculty \viU be
.. firong·; or, if Saturn be in Cancer, the native \Vill have the flux, and
therefore folid food and aftringent liquors \Vould be naturally recom-
mended. The fame doClrine holds in every other complaint, \vhich ·
muft ·be produced by the fuper-abundance of fome one of the four qua..
litics; and, 'vhcn the cff'ential caufe of complaint is once found, a remedy
may be cafily adminifiered. The following table .conveys at one. vie,v,

To point out the ufe· of the above Table, let us fuppo_fe a native to fall
~ fick when his fignificator is· in i\ries, and· fuppofe his lignificator to be
jupiter; look in the top,column for Jupiter, and in the firft column
on .the left hand -for Aries, and in the cornmon angle of meeting yoti
will-find Leo and 'Taurus, which fhovv he is afflicted at the heart, and hath
fome-evil fenfation in his 'throat, &c. for every planet in his o\vn h0ufe
rules· the head ; in the fecond fign from his o\vn houfe, the neck and
thr·oat; in the third, the arms and £boulders; and fo on, as ftated in every
common almanac. Having thus gone through the moft material ob-
fervations nece!fary to form a right underfianding of ficknefs in any
natiVIty, I fuall now proceed to examine the fixth houfe, or houfe of
ficknets, in this geniture. 'fbe fixth houfe, \Ve find, is governed by
the Sun, Mars, and ·Mercury.. Mars.. in this figure, is lord of the af-
cendant, as w~ell as lord of the nxth .houfe, and therefore induces in the
native a· perfect indifference as to the .care of his O\Vn health. Mars ·
being. pofit~d in an earthy fign, i~clines him to choler; w hil~ the Sun
in the fixtn, and Mercury in fextile of Saturn, in a fixed fign, .produ·ce
chronic difeafes, eventuaJ1y inclining to palfy; together with depref-
:fion of fpirits, and habitual melan~boly. 1·his is farther declared by
the oppofition of Saturn to the.. Part of Fortune, who in this figure is
hileg, or giver 9tlife.. If therefore, we examine, by the foregoing
rules, what part of the nativ-e's _b~dy lhall be moft fenfi~ly affliCted ·by
t.his accidental pofition of the planets, we ihall find hitn remarkably fub-
_
ject to pains. in the head from·~ tnelancholy,· firun1as in the throat, a~h-

ing pains in the joints, defects in the cars, 'vith tremors and palpitations of
the heart. ''fhe fignifica'tors being \vholly in the fiery, earthy, and niry,
triplicities, denote likc\vife that the native /hall be very fubject to fevers ;
... but, to t.lifco\rer \Vhen thefe feveral maladies 111,,11 befal him, \\'C rnuft djrcCl:
the fcvcral Ggnificators to their promittors, \vhich \VC !hall prcfently demon-
firate in the dircdions, nnd thereby prove ho\v exactly the fevcral diforders
\\'ith 'vhich 1\'lr. \•{itchell \Vas, during life, affiitl:cd, corrcfponded \Vith
the fignificators in his nat~vity.
The fixth houfe a)fo bears re1~tion to fcrvants, nnd points our ho\v \A.'C
may be afleCl:ed by them. 'l'heir f&gnificators are the planets pofiled in
the fixth, \vith the lord thereof, and the Moon. In this figure \Ve find
the Sun an• t Mercury are in the fixth houfe; and, as the Sun is lord of
the tenth, the houfe of honour and preferment, and in the fign of his
exaltntion, it denotes that the native 1hould have very profitable fervants;
and, finding Mercury in reception of Mars, it indicates that thofe placed
in a fubordinate capacity under hin1 fuould be diligent, nctive, no~ vigilant
in his fervice. In 1hort, I find no injury likely -to arife to him by means
of domefl~cs, except it be from females, and that no way material, lince it
arifes only from the quartile of the Moon to the fixth houfc, in a .
fen1inine figr1. 'fhe circumftances of the nath·e's life fully confirmed this
. .
opnuon.

14'ron1 this houfe 've derive afiral information concerning the native's in-·
tcrcourfe \Vith \vomen : \Vhether he !hall marry, or Ieao a life of celibacy;
\V hether !1e fhall indulge in the deleCtable enjoyments of the fofter fex, or
'vhcther the cold and frigid conformation ·of his nature fhall give him an

'.ro detennine the marriages of men, \Ve mufl: confult their principal fig- ·
uificators, 'vhich are, Venus and the Moon., the feventh houfe, the lord
thereof, and the planets pofited therein. But, to detern1ine the marriages of
'vomen, \Ve muft particularly regard the Sun and Mars, the feventh houfe,
and the plan,et or plan~ts pofitcd therein. 'fo afceitain \vhether the native
'vill rr1arry or not, requires a minute infpedion of the nativity; for, if Saturn
be more elevated than Venus or the Moon, than Mars or the Sun, or fironger
in dignity than all of thern, the native \vill have a natural avcrfion to a
married !late, partitularly if no benefic planet collects his rays, and
conduces thereby to a more communicative and nd:ivc fpirit; for Sa-
turn, being the author of habitual folitarinefs, and, 'vhen fo pouted,

fiinctive affection of the n1ind , -.-and ·that ·generous .,varnub of - the
' paffions, which pature ordained to fiir up .:and fii-mulate· the fenfitive

in afpect \Vith Venus .or tl~e -

.houfes; and dignified in beo·or Taurus, or··the ·Moon·in Scorpio, in quartile
or oppofition 9f S~turn; or ~ if the Moon be in.;conj upction of the Sun in
Capricorn,.Aquaries,·or Libra, and in·oppofition to &lfurn; the perfon born
under fuch .contigurations \V~ill never ·rnarry. And again, tl1e oppofition
or quartile of Venu·s ~and Saturn with the ..Moon, in a barren fign, or
in a cadent -houfe, ..argues · much againfi .a n1arried life. But \\·here
\Ve find the Moon and Venus in male •nativities; or ,the Sun and l\1ars
jn thofe of W()men, I or pofited in fruitful figns, and the lord of the
feventh.houfe f.ortunate, or a benevolent planet in that.houfc, or the figni.. .
ficators of..marriage fituated in .good. parts of the ~figure, or a reception
between· the.lord of. the feventh and .firfi houfes, or a good afp~d: bet\veen
~ny of. the principallignificators, \Ve may then fafely .declare the native will
not only marry~ but is well gua1ified to render that fiate truly blifsful and
.happy.
But~ to know whether matrimony ·,vill ·be contracted \vith eafe, i. e.
without much trouble, anxiety, ·or difappointn1ent, obferve \Vhether
Saturn and ·Mars behold ·each other by ~n oppofition out of the. firfi: or
feventh houfes, or ·whether Venus be pofited in l.eo or Scorpio, in evil
afpeCl: \\ ith Mars, or \vhether Mars tranfits the cufp <;>f the feventh houfe
~in Capricorn, ·virgo, or 'faurus; for, in any of thefe cafes, the native ,viii
find great difficulty and emharrafl'ment in purfuing the object of his affec-
tion, and, whenever matrimony takes place, it will be on a fqdden. If,
~n the·· co~trary, we:find the fignificators of marriage \Vcll beheld by'De-
·nefic .fiars, firong and in good afpect to.Saturn and Mars, and the Jord
.of the feventh applying to the lord of the afcendant, matrimony \Vill be
obtained \vith eafe. 'l'he number of \Vives or hufbands the native iliall
have, is declared by the application of the Moon in men's nativities,
and by the application of the Sun in t.h~fe of \Vomen, either in body or
afpe~; for, 1f the Moon or ·Sun be JOtned with or apply to but one
planet, it denot.es but one wife or hufuand; except thofe figni£cators
chance to be pofited .in \Vatery figns, and then the number is doubled.

:;pply to one planet, it declares one \Vifc; but if in a bi-corporal fign,
applying to m,tny. planets, many \Vives•. But, if none of thcfe configu-

bct\vcen the tnidhcaven and the planet ..VCf)US, if Venus be fituatcd
in the infant oriental quarter, and fo many \Vives or hu!bands !hall
the native have. But, if in the figure of birth no fuch arc found. then
obfcrvc ho\v n1any planets behold the lord of the feventh houfe with
partilc ·afpeet, whether they be retrograde or combufr, and from thence
determine the number of \vives. 7 hefe obfervations, according to the
long-c!b1blifhed evidence of caufcs and effeCts, will in all cafes enable
us to determine this in1portant incident of life, \vhere no oppofitc tefii-
rnonies arc found in the figure of birth fO contradiet them. \Ve !haU
no\v apply thcfe rnatrin1onial rules to the elucidation of that fubjcet in
the prefent. nativity. 'I'hc Moon and Venus arc Mr. Witchcll·s figni..
ftcators of marriage: the Moon is not in a barren fign, nor ..affiiCl.ed by ·
any malefic fl:ar, nor is !he pofited in the fixth, ninth, t\vclfth, .
or
eighth, .houfes of the figure; again, lhe is not COIJJhufi of the .Sun,
nor und\!r any other evil influence. It therefore teftifi~s a natural in-
clination in the native of entering into a marriage fiate. This judg-
tnent ·is confiderably augmented by the lord of the .feventb, viz. Mars.,
being· in an exact fefquiquadrate of. the Moon; and Venus being .at the .
f..1me time in a fruitful 1ign in reception of Jupiter, produces ; firong
tefl:imony of radical heat, or amorous defires, in .
the native, to 1Hmulate

'l~he titne when his marriage fuould pe completed, is determined by
the motion of the fignificators; and that motion, or fpecial time, is
afcertained, by direCting the Moon, or Venus, to a fextile, trine, or

As to the number of 'vives, if we exan1ine the Moon by the rules
alre·ady given, we fuall find the native wi11 h~ve but one. 'fhe Moon,
in this nativity, applies but to 9ne planet, _\vhile. fr1e is in the fign
Capricorn, and tha~ planet is Mercury, \vho is in reception of Mars,
lord of the feventh houfe, and therefore n1ufi have .pre-emin'ence in the
defcription of the wife, \Vho was a perfon of a tallifl1 fiature, · fair com-
plexion, light brown hair, 1harp, witty, ·and ingenious, and of a fan-
-guine· choleric difpofition, precifely as the fignificators if!1ply. '·
· · The reafon Jttpiter is not admitted in tefiimony of a fccond viifc, is
becaufe, according to his latitude, he ·is out of 'I'aurus, and is verging
into the fign Gemini; and therefore the Moon cannot be faid to apply
to hirn while the is p9lite~ in tl1e fign Capricorn ; a di£l:inction that
every artift mufl: carefully·make} or his labours vvill be often vain, and
his judgment founded in error. Modern practitioners have in general
paid little or no attention to the latitude of the Hars, a thing of the

that has been brought upon tht~ departrr1~nt o~ the fcterice of Afironomy.

as ihc falls in a fe1nininc fign, and being herfclf a feminine planet, that
\VOnlen in general fhall be the moft dangerous enemies of this nati\'c;
at lcafi fuch as !hall eventually do him the grcatcfi injury. 'l'o confirm
this, it n1ay be noted that Venus is \Veil dignified in Pifccs. a watery

being in reception of Mercury, and in afpect \Vith the Moon, denotes

The eiglu.h houfe has lignification of death and of preferments, and
advantages by death, as hath been fully explained in p,t~e 155· But let·
it be retnetnbered, that this houfc is not to be directed trom death unlefs
it contains the anareta or killing fiar, any more than the fixth or t\velfth
houfes; for death arifes from other caufes than merely the pofirion or
tranfiting of the cufps of houfes, as we. have abundantly 1ho\vn in·.
page 455. But this houfe, being under the dotninion of the malefic
planets, participates mofily of the quality of de~th, and hath therefore ·
been ailigned to this particular enq~iry, which, indeed, is of the Iaft·
importance.

The. fhortnefs or du~ation of life depends upon the diflance of the
hileg, or giver, of life, from the evil rays of the anareta, or killing pla-
net, which is afcertained by direel: direCtion' or by the tnotion of the
pri!num 1nobile, whereby the hileg is carried to the cufp of the feventh
houfe; and then, by adding or fubtracting the tefiim.onies given by benefic
or malefic fiars with the cortlplexion of the anareta, the length of tin1e
will be obt~ined according to the faid motion, as \Ve !hall more particu-
larly define ·jn bringi.nf? up the directions. -
The hileg, or giver of life, in this nativity, is the Part of Fortune;
and the anareta, or defiroying planet, is ~he Sun. Now, when the Part
of Fortune, by ~ direCt direction, -con1es to th~ oppofirion of the Sun, the
native will be deprived of radical moifl:ure, and muft expire; becaufe
the Sun, by obtaining that pofition, overcomes the influence of all the
other planets, and hath power to cut off Jife. rrhe quality of death is
firft to be taken from the nature of the n1alevoleo~ planet; fecondly,
from the nature of the fign the planet is in; thirdly, from the quality
of the houfe; and, fourthly, fron1 the pofttion of the t\VO luminaries;
all of which I have heretofore ·copiou:!ly explained.

From this houfe \Ve gi,·e judgment on the effeCts of journeys; of the..in-

for in each of thefe cafes refpeCttvely, the native s mtnd \VIII be too reftlefs
and unfettled, t"o contintte long at a titne in one place or fituation. So like..
\Vife the }ord of the firfi -
pofited in the ninth,. Or tbe.}ord of the ninth COn--
figurated in the firft,- prefn.ge th~ fame.
When the S~n ~s pofited in the proper houfe of the Moon, irradiated
by l\1ercury or JYlars, or in re_c~ption \Yith either of th~m by effential
dignities; o'r if tl1e Sun be conJOlned by any afpeCl: to Mercury, M.ars,
or the rlloo'n, it denotes a removal of the native from · one fituation to
another, as the cafe may be: So like\vife many planets. in a n1ovea.ble
iign; Mercury in the h~oufe of the Moon, or the Moon in the houfe
of Mercury, induce the ·fame confequences; and planets accidentally
· pofited, efpecially ~he Moon, are obvious implicators of travelling.
But the qua-
rter of the \vorld to which the native fhall 'be in1pelled, is
afcertaincd by con1paring the latitude and, longitude · of thofe parts of ·
the heavens \vhere thc_fignificators of tFavelliog fall, -\vith the latitude \
or place.of the n~tive's birth;. uniformly obferving this fianding maxirn·,
that if · thefe fignificators fall to the tenth, eleventh,, t\velfth·, firfi, fe:..
cond, or third, houfes, the native fhall travel toward the eafi; but if ..
, they are found 'in the fourth, fifth,' lixth', feventh, eighth, ·or riinth,
houfes, then he {hall travel weft\Vard ; and that quarter of the \vorld
will, in a general \vay, prove n1~fi: conducive to the native's good for•
tune, where Jupiter, Venus, the Dragon's Head, or Part of Fortune,
are pofited, provided they are dignifieq in good houfes of the figure, and
not vitiated qy n1alefic rays. · .
. 1·hefe confiderations being annexed to thofe ru1es laid_do\vn ·in page
451, will enable us to dra\V all neceffary conclufions concerning the
material· or effective journeys of the native. In this nativity \Ve find
Mercury a very principal /fignificator of travelling,' pofited in Aries, and
in reception of Mars, in the tenth houfe. This declares the natiYe
fhould be impelled wefiward, firongly urged by fcientific acquiren1ents,
,vbich is the true and radical implication of this planet's nature an·d .
influence. And·as Mercury is elevated in the fixth· houfe,. in conjunc-
tion of the Sun jn his exaltation, it is an irreftfiible arg~ment that the
native tbould be raifed by ~he events of this journey to an advantageous
pofr, under the ai.tfpices of princely authority, as the exalted afpeet of
the Suri clearly uemonfirates. And again, Mercury. being lord of· die
eleventh houfe, and having his exaltatio.n in Virgo, decla~;es · that this
journey fh.all be taken through the medium of friends 'vho were fcicn-
tific men ;-and as Ven-us· is- ~~dy of the afcendant, fituated -.in the ·\vatery·

fign Pifces, and near the fortunate node of the Moo~, it is thereby
further declared, that this journey fhall be made in that angle \vhich is
'vefi from London, the place of the native's birth; and that it 01all be
t-erminated by fotne great body of \Vater, in the vicir:ity of which the
native fhall find a cturable refidence. 'fhis \Vns, in every inilancc, moll:
remarkably verified in the n'ttivc's appointment to a fcicntific office in
"his Majefiy,s Dock Yard at Portfmouth, upon the recon1mcndation of
fon1e of the Fello\vs of the H.oyal Society; in confequcncc of \vhich., this
irnportant journey \Vas taken, and a11· the fubordinatc events \Vere really
brought to pafs.
..
We have nc?'t to confider the exemplary or religious bent of the native's
mind; \vhich is uiually afcertaincd by the foJlo\ving configurations.
Jupiter, Venus, or the Dragon's Head, placed in the· ninth or third
houfes, or configurated \Vith Spica Virgo, arc certain prefitges of a moral
and religious _
perfon. T~e Moon, ~Jercury, and Part of Fortune, in:
fin1ilar pofitions, denote the fame; but the Sun effentially dignified in the
ninth hou{e, fhows a very firong natural,propenfity to moral and religious
practices; and., if the native happens to be bred a clergyman, he becon1es a
mofi admirable preacher, and hath every profpeet of confiderable preferment
il\ the church.
\Vhenever it liappens that no planets are found· in the ninth houfe of
the figure, \VC mufl have particular regard to the aftral pofition of Ju..
piter·; for if he be in his o\vn houfe, or in reception with Venus or·
Mercury, or \Vith the Sun or Moon; or in conjunction, fextile, or trine,
with Venus, in angular places, they declare the native to be in princi:..
pie a firictly tnoral and confcientious man, poffeffed of tnore fterling·
· integrity than thofc \vho tnake large profeillon$. But Saturn, Mars,
or the Dragon's Tail, pofited in the ninth· houfe, and in n1oveablc figns,
with Jupiter peregrine~ cadent, or in. bad ·afped: . \Vith Saturn or J\tlars,
prcf:1.ge great mutability in religious perfuafion, 'vhich ·generally ter-
. rninates in atheifm. Saturn pofit\ed in a comn1on fign, ill dignified;
and rctrogra.._de, befpeaks an hypocrite; and Mars thus configurated,
fore!ho,vs a mind pliable to any perfuafion that \vill befl: 1crve the·purpofes
of avarice and ambition.
•
If \Ve may preftune to fpeak ·of the native's moral and religious cha--
raCter, according to the true implication of the fignificators in his ge.:.
nethliacal figure of birth,.. 've cannot hefitnte to affir~, that the Moon

native .fliall be confiant to that faith in· \vhich he 'vas brought up al)d-

:Let-it not be fuppofed, trotn the· foregoing obfervat'ions, that I \Vould
\vifh to infer that the fl:ars have power to make a man a _fa~nt ·or a deviJ;
or in any ihape to govern or direct his judgtncnt or his \Vill. 'I his' is
not what I contend for:; ·bl;lt..thus much I am free to affert, ..that they ~
clearly point put our natural inclinations, whether.·g?o~. ror evil; and
it \viii generally be found that thofe inclinations. carry fo firong a bias
over our reafon and moral intellect, that, in ninety-nine inftances out of a
hundred, .the natural infl~ence or inclination impr~ffcd by each n1an's
:fignificators ,,·ill be found .to ..prevail.. And yet this i·s no defeCl in our
moral perception; for, each man having the ab~li~y ·to' diflinguilh. be.
t.\veen right and wrong, if he chufes to do \vrong, in oppofition fo that
which he kno\vs to be his duty, it is an open violation of his·O\vn fenfe
and ·reaion, and a \villing facrifice of the duties of morality and r.eligion.
Hence the excellence of that celebrated remark on ancient philofophers,
'' that \vife men rule their fiars, and none but \Vicked men or fools are
r,uled by them.'' ~ ,

the Moon \Vith the lord of the hour; hut oftentimes remains unfinitl1cd
until the Moon con1es in contaCt )Vith another afpcet of the fame nature
and fignification.
In this nativity the Moon and Venus arc the principal 1ignificators of
dreams; the one being lady of the ninth houfe, and the other beholding
that houie \Vith a trine afped; and rhey are 1h·ong argurnents that the
native Chould frequently have in1portant comn1unications through the
1nedium ofdrea1ns. .,
CONSIDERATIONS refulting from the TE~TH I-IOUSE.
.
The tenth houfc hath ftgnification of honour, preferment, trade, pro..
feflion, or of any regular and accufiomed means by \vhich men live, and
arc refpeCted. In treating of \Vhich, it \Vi11 be neccifary to obferve the
follo\ving rules, in addition to thofe laid do\vn in page 438.
If the Sun or Moon, in the· figure of birth, tltall happen to be·pofited
in the very degree of the exaltation, and at the L1me tin1e free fron1
the evil afpeds of the infortunes~ it is a powerful indication of the mo!l:
flattering acquifitions ·to.' the native, in proportion to his capacity and
degree of birth. 'Vhen the 1ight of time tranfits the cufp of the mid..
_~ heaven, and is furrounded by benefic planets in the hour of birth, and
no malefic rays of the infortunes intervene, the native !hall arriYe to
fQme irnportant pofl: of po\ver and authority under government; or to a
public employment of dignity and honour, under forne'chartered body, or
princely po\ver, in proportion to the condition of his birth. If the Sun or
Moon are pofited in angles, though unaided by other configurations, yet
the native !11alllive in much refpecl: and efieem all his days. In thofe fi-
_
gures of birth \Vhere neither of the lutninarics are found pofited in angJes,
nor in any of th~ir e1Tential digni~ies, nor in mafculine figns, nor configu-
rated \vith the prcpitious rays of Jupiter or 'renus, be alfurcd the
condition of the native \Vill be poor and abjeCt -all his days, no
matter \vhnt might be his hereditary profpects at his hour of birth..
But if the planets that have dominion in the places of the Sun and
Moon, or in the degrees afcending, !hall be orienta1Jy fixed, and \Vell
dignified, the native fhall raifc hitnfelf to a high condition, efpecially if,
by a concatenation of fortuitous events, thote planets are alpeCled by
either of the benefics.
No. 37· SY Jupiter

Jupiter pofited in the tenth ho~fc, in a diqrnal nati~ityJ gives a pretty
accurate.tefiimony, that the native !hall be employed In. fame advantage-

good fortune to b~ born juft.at noo.n, .when the Sun enters the me~i~i~u1,

firlt houfe, oppofed to the $un in the ·feventh, and in quartile of .Jupiter
in the fourth, gives wealth and authority, by the perquifites of magifl:racy, ,
embaffies, &c. b~t -
if the Moon · be in the afce~dant, and the Sun in par-
~i)e conjun_
clion with Venus, wealth and honour w{
ill come by ecclefiafti-

The fixed fiars, like\~ife, in this fpec_
ulation, have, by accidental confi-
guratiqn, .a r~ofl: in1portant influence. If the Moon be with Cor Leonis~
and Jupiter elevat~d in the tenth houfe, in trine of·Mars, and in effential
oignity, the Sun being at the fame time_in conjunction with the dragon's
hea~, will produce thofe rapid. and unexpetted turns of good fortune
and preferment, that equally furprife the native, and afloniih mank'ind. ·
To confirm the certainty of this obf~rvation, I cquld qnly wilh the geni-
tun~s of Sir R·oger Curtis, Sir Francis Sykes, -Si~ Thomas Rumbold, Mr.
Mackreth, and a hundred others in fimilar circumllances, to be infpetl:ed,
~nd ~ will forfeit my Jlead if the radical caufe is not found equally the
fa.me in them all. ·
According to. this hypothelis, thofe perfons fhall likewife prove for- .
tunate and illufirious, in whofe nativities the Moon is in gaod ~fpect
lvith n1any planets, united \Vith a princely ftar; and he that hath in
other refpects but an unpromifing geniture as ·to riches· and. honour, yet -
if he hath the Moon configurated with any eminent fixed ftar of the firft.

only be furmountcd by an unfeeling fpirit of rapine and violence. Infpect

or with Rigal in thirteen degrees fifty..fix minutes of Gen1ini, the na-
tive \vill acquire an illufirio~s charaCter and fortune. Regulus, Arcturus,
the right fuoulder .of Orion, or the left of the Waggoner, configurated
'Yith the Sun, Jupiter, or the Moon.; in· the tenth houfe of the figure,
give alfo ample fortune, and reputation. Thus the fixed fiars, \vhen in
angles, contribute admirable efficacy to any geniture; but, if the benefic
planets do not at the fame time c9ntribute their influence jointly with,
them, they are of but little import J and,. if malefic planets are joined
\Vith them, they then induce n1uch mifchief; for if the Hyades, Hercu-

gurated \Vith Satu~n or Mars, in~ qu~rtile O! oppofite~ afpeet,. thofe fixed

Upon enquiry, I found this native was mechanically.brought up to
- the profeilion of, a vvatchmaker and goldfmith; but, if we attentively
confider· the import of the proper fignificators of his preferment and
profeflion, we fhall find that nature had fitted him for a mor~ ~ refined
and elevated line of life. . The cardinal and equinoCtial fign Libra. is
upon the cufp of ~is· afcenda~t; rhe Sun .pofited in the ~ardinal il.gn
Aries; the Moon 1n the trop1cal fign Capncorn; Mercury and Mars,
the t\vo principal fignificators of his profeffi.on, in receptio~ of each
other; Mars alfo in the exaltation of Mercury, and pouted .in tbe tenth
houfe, the houfe ·of hono~r and preferment ; the part of fortune alto -in
the tenth, configurated with the t\Vo royal fixed .ftars, Hydra and Cor
Leonis, are fo many ttnequivocal arguments, not only that the native
fhould abandon every handicraft employment, in purfuit of the n1ore
elevated and fublime fiudy of the liberal arts and fciences, but that he
~ou1d eventually obtain honour, ' promotion, and emolument, by the
purfu'it•.. Mar.s, befides being the principal fignificator of his profeflion,
is alfo lord of the a(cendant, and therefore proves that the avocation of
the native fhould be fuch as he would make choice of hin1felf, and that
it would be in the line of fcience, as is moft aptly declared by the pofi-
tion of Mars·in the dignities of Mercury; \vhilfr the S_
un being in the
houfe of his exaltation, and lord of the tenth, declares honour and pre-
ferment !hould refult from it, with durations of fuccefs; and the more
fo, ·becaufe the Sun fends a trine afpeCl: to the tenth houfe, as \veil as
Mercury, ·,vhich proves.his profperity and advancetnent to arife fron1 his
O\Vll intrinfic n1erit. ·
All this \vas in a mo!l re1narkable manner verified by·the \Vonderful
fucceifes and purfuits of ~he .native, in oppoGtion to every obftacle, diffi-
culty, and o_ppreffion, thro\vn·in his way, by attempts to force upon hirn
an etnployment incon1patible \Vith his genius. His many curious and

reprefcnts the E1ther; and Saturn being configurated in that houfc, in
eflential dignities, in an airy and fcientific fign, proves the father to ha\ e
inherited a fcicntific turn. But the tenth houfc bears fignification of the
native's mother, whole fpirit of generofity and elevation of foul arc mofl

Upon the \Vhole, vve may ren1ark, that fe\V events can more illufiri-
ouHy difplay the obvioufnefs of planetary information, or more vifibly de-
monflrate the goodnefs of God in mercifully affording his creatures this
a~onifh~ng mode of con1municat~on, than the foregoing radical proofs of
tlus native's natural force of gentus; \Vho, at t\velve years of age, was of
fufficient capacity to fend a mofl: elaborate piece for infertion in the Gen-
tleman's Diary; and, at the early age of t\\renty-one, ·was ad1nitted a

fhare of friends ; and nearly the fame w1ll ,be the lot of thofe 1n whofe
nativities the lord of the eleventh houfe and the lord of.. the afcendant are
found feparating from ii propitious configuration._
If it be in any cafe required to kno\v whether mutual~ good offices of
friendfhip !hall long exifi bet"Neen any t\vb particular perfons, or be-
tween .Jovers or fweethearts before marriage, or bet·w·een hufband and
vvife after, the ,only certain· 1node of obtaining· this.jnformation is by
comparing the two nativities of either of the two perfons together, and,
according to their itnport, judge. For, if- the afcendant in the-figures ·
of both parties have the fame f1go ~afcending, or the fa~e planets in the
firfi h~ufe, or beholding each other by the lame afpel:t, n1utual friend-
fhip, love, and confidence, will long exifi; for, as affinity of ma~ners
and likenefs are the effence of affeElion, fo affe&ion, in this fpeculation,
mufi be the author of agreement, of fincerity, and of friendfhip. 1'o de:...
monfirate this, let us confider the· influence and condition of the lord of
the afcendant, under its four different configurations.: viz. firfi, when
in both nativities he is bonafide the fame planet; fecondJy, ·when he is
teceived of the other nativity by houfe or exaltation ; thirdly, when he
is in conjunaiop \Vith the lord of the alcendant of the. other nativity;
and, fourthly, when he is in fextile or trine of .the lord of the other na·
tivity. For, in all cafes where there is not a concurrence of one or other
of thefe teHimonies, the friendfhip or attachment of tbofe two particular
perfons '\Vill not be found of long continuance. .. ·
· When, 1n the nativities of any t'vo given perfons, the one hath Venus
in the pofitiorl. ,\..here the other hath the Mpon, or the Sun, the part
of fortune, or the lord of the- afcendant, it is a ft.ibfiantial proof that
there 'vill be firm and laHing friendfhip bet\veen them; but, '-Vhenever it
is found~ i~ any two nativities, t.hat the fign upon the afcendant of the
one occuptes the cufp of the twelfth, eighth, pr fixth, boufes of the
other~ there cannot poffibly be any durable attachrnent or friend01ip be-
tween" the parties. It ha.th been determined, by repeated obfer~lation,
that ~thofe perfons regard,each other with the pureH friendfhip where
the lord of the afcendant in one nativity applies to the lord of the afcen-
dant in the other, or ·where the benevolent planets are found in reception
of. each other. By the fame p~rity or reafoniog, they hate moft invete-
rately where the fame number of mahgnant planets occupy the afcendant
of each other's nativity; or \vhere the lord of the afcendant in one nati-

Mars. rvlars hath pacific tendency only to \ 1cnus, and that by tneans
of her fupf·nor property in all;tying his intcn1peratc heat; for other\\'ife
they arc contrary 1n nature, l'vfars being hot and dry, and Venus cold
and 1noill. 'fhc Sun hath· friendfhip only to Jupiter and \Tenus; and
is inin1ical to Saturn, I\1ars, Mercury, and the 1\tloon. Venus is conl-
placcntly beheld by Jupiter, lVlars, the Sun, Mercury, and the Moon;
but rigid.Saturn is her mortal enemy. I\1ercury hath friendfhip to Sa-
turn, Jupiter, and Venus; but the Sun, the ~loon, and Mars. are his ene-
Jnics. ]'he l\1oon pacifically beholds Saturn, Jupiter, and Venus; but
hath enmity to J\tlars, the Sun: and Mercury. 'j·he Dragon's I-Icad hath
fympathy \\'ith Jupiter and Venus ; but antipathy to Saturn, 1\Jars, the
Sun, .1\tlercury, and the Moon. 1'he Dragon's Tail hath Saturn and
11ars in friendfhip; but Jupiter, the Sun, Venus, Mercury., and the Moon,.
are enemies.: the Part of },ortune is in this cafe confiituted precifely the
fan1e as the Moon. ..
By thefe rules it \\rill be obvious, that, '\Vhere \Ve find, in tv;o nativi-
ties, the Sun and Moon, or l\1crcury and the Moon, or th~ Sun and Mer-
cury, configurated in each other's places, there will cxitl feme degree of'
refpecl and good-will between the nt1tives; but, if Saturn, Jupiter, Venus,

defire of friendfhip. If Jupiter or Saturn are found in reception ofeach
other's place in the different nativities, their friendfhip \\·ill exifl: merely
for the purpo{es of emolument or avarice; but, if N1ars and Venus are in~
each other's place, the attachn1ent of the parties v.'ill be for1ned for illicit
and difhonourable praaices.
\iVhen in the nativities of any t"\tVO perfons, 'VC find the Sun or Mars in.
oppofition to l\1crcury or the ~.1o~n, the parties \vill delight to injure
and opprefs,each other; but, "Vlrhere Sarurn or M~rs are in oppo6tion, the
enmity y;ill be perpetual. \Vhere the rnalcfic ·nars agree, the parties

The -quality and nature of friends are determined. by the planet that
is principal ficrnificator. For infiance, if Saturn is pofi ted in the ele-
venth or firfl: h~ufes, and in no dignities, he is the fignificator, and de-
notes talfe and taithJef.s friends; but, if '\V~ll dignified~ he declares con- ·
fJant anq honourable fri~nds, according.to the particular c.ircurri_H~n~es of
his own nature and quality; a~ doth each of the planets refpeEbvely,
according to which rule I exami-
ne the prelent nativity. I find the fign
occupying the eleventh houfe is Virgo, the exaltation of Mercury ; and,
as there are no planets therein, we. n1ufi particularly .regard the pofition
of Mercury, who is lord of the eleventh ho'uie, from whence this judg-
ment is deduced. I obferv.e Mercury is in reception of Mars; and Mars
being lord of the native's afcendant is a demonfrrabl~ proof that he fhould
have many and great f~iends; fuch as 'vere of a fcientific turn thernfelves,
and \Veil qualified to forward the vie\\'S of the native; who would admire·
his afpiring genius, and take him by the hand. ..fhis was completely v·e-

CONSIDERATIONS refulting frdm the TWELFTH HOUSE.

From this houfe we obtain cognizance of our malignant private ene-

Wl;lether this houle be pr:operly under the government ofmalefic influence
or not, is of little importance to ·the objeB:s ·of our prefent enquiry; iuf-
fice it fay, that it anfwers every purpofe fo{" dete&ing t hofe forked or

even among the more liberal and humane~ that with a friend!y hand

\vhcn COlllplctcly polifhrd; nor arc cnen1irs ever fo dangerous as \\'hen
concealed. It is therefore not the leaH itnportant among our aflral en-
quiries to infonn ourfelves \Vt'll of the quality and ftrength of our priva1.c
encn1ies; and, to make this enquiry obvious to all n1y readers, I have, in
page 459, gi\*Cn a1nple rules to detrft and to elude tl1cir rnalicc. l
ilulll now apply thetn in Ill)' obfcrvations on the prcfcnt nati\'ity. On
the cufp of the t\vrlfth hou(c, \fC. find the fign Libra, \\'hich is the day-
houfe or Vcriu~, and \Vholly under her govcrntncnt, in the houfe of her
exaltation; and, as fhe is in dirett oppofition to the lord oF the afccn-
dant, and is alfo lady of the fcventh hou fe, fl1c obvioufly declares that
fon1e '\'oman fhould bccorhe an in1placablc enctny to the native; and that
this \\·oman fhould not be of the mean or vulgar fort, is declared by ·
Venus being in her effential dignities. But, as neither of the JuJnl-
naries are afl(!c1ed, nor the lord oF the afcendant vitiateq by malefic rays,
it is impoH1b1e the malignity of this \\~oman's refentrncnt fhould ever
materially affeB: the well-being of the ·native. Befi.dcs, there are two
royal fixed Hars pofiterl in the t\velfth houfc, viz. ArEturus and Spica
\Tirginis, \vhich not only furnifh an argument that this female opponent
lbould do hirn little injury, but that no private enemies filould ever be
able to accomplifh his ruin, or opprefs him by irnprifonment. And as
the luminaries arc free from the afflitlion both of.Saturn and Mars, and
as no malignant planet occupies the afcendant, t\velfth, or (ixth, houfe of
the figure, I arr1 free to declare my opinion, that the native never \viii be
expofed even to the danger of imprifonmentJ either by civiJ or cri1ninal
procefs, 'vhich might anfe either from the hand of Jufiice, or through
his own indifcretion.
Having thus completely invefiigated the various afpetls of this nati-
vity, according to tl1e genuine import they bear in each of the t'\relve
horofcopical places or houfcs of the heavens; l fhall now proce~d to bring
thofe afpeas refpeaively into view, in the precife order in which they
come up by dirctlion, and in which they affeRed the n1undane acrions,
purfuits, and eventually the life, of the native ; \Vhence it \\~ill appear,
that the nativity of any man, \vhen carreElly and judicioufly calculated,
'vill in a n1anner difplay a cotnpendium of the principal inc,idents of the
native'~ life, from hi~ birth to his dilfo1ution; taking into vie,v, as \veil
the things paH as thofc which are to come. 1..o make this the more in-
telligible to thofe \\1l1o mean to fiudy the fcience, as 'veil as to the bulk
of my readers, I !hall confider the direClions of this nativity cxaalr in
the order they occur, from the time of ~ir. \·Vitchell's birth to the day

of \\'ltich the follo\A.·ing is an explanation.
'
The \top column of the table, from left _
to right, d1fplays in regular ....
fucqeffion the t~Nelve figns of the zod1ac, beginning \\Tith Aries, and
ending w.ith Pifces ; under ·which are refpeEl:ively placed thirty ~egrees
of t.he zodiac for each fign, 1uaking in the whole three hundred and
iixty degrees. The firfl: colun1n on the left contains degrees and n1i-
nutes as'far as c0111pletes one fign; and, wherever mjnutes are joined to
'degrees, -it fhe-w·s there is an afpea in the nativi.ty that falls in that dt>gree
and tninute .of the correfponding fign -under which the planet flands..
.For' example, under the letters D. M. at the top of the firfl colun1n,
fiand o 44, and under the fign Virgo, in the common angle of meeting,
.is found the planet Mars, which fhews that 1vlars, in this nativtty.,
is pofited· in forty--four minutes of the fign Virgo; and gives us at
one view every configuration made by that planet throughou( the
zodiac.; for at thirty degrees from his given place he forrns a femi-
fextile ; ·at fixty degrees from the Iam~ point he forms a !extile ; at
feventy-two degrees· he forms a quintile; at ninety degrees a quartile;
at one hundred and twenty degrees a trine; at one hundred thirty-five
degrees a fefquiquadrate ; and at one hundr~d and eighty degrees an
oppofition,; whereby every afpett is at once fought out, as "ve1l thofe
of the other planets as of Mars. The termJ and faces of the planets
are alfo denoted thrdughout the zodiac, by the ini!ials 1-y and F; the
ufe of 'vhich is to point out to the reader an eafy and concife tnethod of ·
facilitating zodiacal direaions ; particularly to the Sun, as· the ecliptic
line j.., the only 9rb in 'vhich he moves, and wherein he tneets \vith all
-the afpeas of the erratic flars, 'vith their terms, faces, exaltations, &c.
I ·fhall now take thefe afpeEls from the Speculutn, in the order they
Hand in the table, p. 686, as well mundane as zodiacal, and explain
their reli)eetive fignificators, by fhe,ving their power and effetl upon the

operating in the force of inenta] cndo\Vnlcnts. Under this dircaion

a ftnall piece, for the Gentletnan's Magazine, \4
:hich ,.,as htghly

Moon to the parallel of Venus'in tnundo ; \vhich being of the {arne
quality, gave force and energy td the influence of the preceding.
ffi M. C. Part· of Fortune to the medium-ca:li. This is a very ·Te-
markabl.e, and equally. potent direftjon, operating upon the mental
fac-ulties; and it came up when the native \Vas about thirteen years and
four tnonths old, as may be feen by the calculation p. 661, "·here thefe
diretl.ions are worked up and equated by the folar tnotion. Under the
influence of this direaion, the native, at that early period of his life,
compiled a rnofi ingenious mathernatical difquifition, 'vhich \vas printed
in the Gentleman's Diary, and received univerfal approbation.
.EBo ¥. Part of Fortune to the quartile.of Jupiter. This direaion
portends evil to the native's fiate of health, and has a malefic tendency.
Jupiter, though in nature the moU benignant planet, in this cafe pro-
duces an evil effeB:, by the confiitution of ~he afpea he forms. He is
pofited, according to his latitude in Getnini, in the eighth houfe, among
fixed fiars of the quality of Mars, in quartile with the Part of Fortune.
\vhich, in this nauvity, is Hyleg, and fironrrly appertains to the na-·

of Jupiter in this pofition, 'vhich caufcth heat and putrefaaion of the
blood, I concluded that this direaion xnu!l have brought with .1t a
violent fever, becaufe the quartile afpeEl is produClive of the greatefi
evil, and becau{e this diretlioo falls ·in the tern1s and face of Mars, ,..·ho
is the author of cholt.r, and uniformly produc1ive of putrefaction ofthe
anitnal juices~ though here are no teHitnonies to {hew, that its violence
fhould be fuch as to endanger life, This direElion came up in fourteen

apprentice .to a watchmaker and goldfmith ; which is aptly enough
defcribed by a conjunaion of the Sun and M.ercu·

direB:ion, as we have before proved, came up in fifteen years and
twenty-one days; at that precife age the native and·his mafl:er, as he hath

them into etfe8:, thofe unpleafant .circumHances which are invariably
felt in all firnilar cafes. 1"·he Part ofFortupe to the fefquiquadrate afpeB:
of ·l\1ercu.ry, is a direCtion that took off the tlfoughts and the attention of
the native from all mechanical. employment, and fixed them upon ma-
thematical contemplation. The Moon to a·zodiacal parallel of Jupiter,
fl:rengthens and enlarges this fiudious and contemplative faculty, expands
the underfianding, and allures the n1ind to a purfuit of thofe acquire-
nlents~ which render manual employments infupportable. Part of
Fortune to.the conjunB:ion ofMars, could not fail, when the dire&ion came
up, to produce violent contentions between the ·native and his maHer, in
confequence of his total neglea of·the bufi.nefs, and of his inattention
.t6 the orders and infiru&ions given him therein. Upon enquiry, I found
my judgment in no refpetl erroneous; for, although the maHer was on
the one. hand continually re'monfirating a·nd complaining of neglea and
inattention, the appren~.ice.,. OI? the other, was totally indifferent as to
the i1l confequences threatened, and {till addiaed himfelf to the ufe. of
books, to the folving ~nd propounding mathema~ical quefiions,· and to
the publication of anonymous pieces in the magazines.

forn1ed bet,vixt them, leads me to conceive, that the native, .\vhile un-

'vas eighteen years and four months old; about ~Nhich time, as he has

M. C. 8 1J. The medium creli to. the oppofitio·n of Saturn. This
is a no lefs remarkable than fatal direCtion, again appertaining to the
native and hi&n1afier. It lliews an animofity between them, fo far as it
relates to the bufinefs;.~ut it prefages the death of the maHer, and once
m?re ~ets the apprentt~e at liberty; .'as though fate had really Hrove
with htm to obtatn ·a different purfu1t. But here, as I have b.een con-
£qently informed, the parent again interpofed his fovereign authority, and
. in fpite of every argument, and of every importunity, fo prejudiced was
he in favour of the err1oluments of trade, and fo fixed ·in his mind upon
that which he had before fingled out for his fon, that he lofi no tin1e in
chooftng him out a new fituation. Here 've perceive, in its firongeft
colours, the abfurdity, as well as the evil conlequence of forcing upon
the hands of youth, avocations \vhich their nature loathes, and \Vhich
are foreign both to .their ability, and their inclination. I..et us here for
a moment paufe, and look which 'way we wiJl, vve·fhall find a1nple tef-
timonies of the truth of this mifiaken zeal for the provifio~ of our chil-
dren._ A zeal 'vhich has more ihan all other caufes put together, fur-
niChed the world with a race or bungler~ in' almofl: every profeffioil; j
for the mind, l1ke the temperature of the body, cannot be forced, but
will be governed by its own immediate laws; a circumfiance, which if
duly attended to, and regulated by the quality of the fignificators at birth,
would not only prove much more highly advantageous to children, but
.infinitely 1nore beneficial to mafl:ers of every craft and occupation.

their direEl:ions are of courre mundane. They are both quartiles of a

J,nC\\' he had often accu!lomed himfe]f to read in bed, I had a flrong
fulj)icion that he had fallen aflcep, and that the curtains had taken fire,
~~d expofed.him to the danger of being bu:nt in bed.~ But this he ~b...
· folutely dcn1ed" and contended much for hts carcfulne{s and precaution
on thofe occafions. Had_
he by any accident fallen into the,.,fire? or had
the candle caught his clothes? No; he never had met 'vith !uch an ac-
cident in his life. I perfiH.ed n1oH: confidently that fome fuch accident
mufl. have befallen him, and at that particular time, \vhereby he \Vas ex-
pofcd either to great bodily hurt, if not to the dange'r of 1ofing his life;
and I requefied him to refleEl upon the tnatter, and to tell n1c ing~nuoufly
the faB:. At laH, · he 'fatisfied my doubts, by relating the follo\ving cir-
cutnfiance : ,
He had not been many days 'vith his ne'v maHer, before be 'vas left
in the {hop \Vith no other companion than a youn~ lad, \vho had been
put apprentice to the fame perfon a year or t\VO before. At the fame
time that the mafiees abfence furnifhed Mr. vVitcheJl \Vith an oppor-
tunity of taking a book from his pocket to read,' "
Nhich \Vas invariably
the cafe upon all fi1ch occafions, it afforded the other lad fit time to go
to play. A foldier's mufquet flood in· one corner of the fhop, tnofi aptly
denoted by the quartile pofition of Mars, which the boy took up, and
began to perform the manual exercife \Vith. \\'hen he came to that
part, " make ready-pre{ent-fire,'' he levelled the piece clofe to the
body of his fello,v-apprentice vVitchcll, \fho L'lt \Vith the utmofl
calmnefs and compofure, reading his book; a circumfiance evidently
implied by the pofition of Mercury. The boy drew the trigger, the
gun fnapped, and he recovered his arms. Pleafed of courfe \Vith any
employment rather than \Vith his bufinefs, he proceeded '"ith the tna..
nual a fecond time. \Vhen he prefented the piece again, it 'vas ele-
vated fome\vhat above Mr. \Vitchell's·head; he dre\V the trigger, the
gun \vent off, and carried aw·ay a large piece of the \Vindo\v, leaving

- J was quite fatisfied; it relieved me from ·my doubts ; and upon equat-
ing the direClion, I told hi1n this mufi have happened on or very near
the 26th of September, 1747; for, though the 9ther afpea catne up
iooner, yet its influence was held on by the quick fucceffion and fimilar
quality of the co-operating or fecondary afpeB:, :which was not ripe in
its malefic tendency, until the day Mars began to feparate from his
' auxiliaries, \Vhich was On the day above-mentioned, at which titne the
native 'vas near t\ventyyears ofage. After end~aVOl(lring to recolleEl all
the .circumfiances of the faa, he acknowledged I '"ras firiClly right in:
point of time, as well as in my judgment of the danger he had been ex-
pofed to by means of fire. ' ·
\
The aflrological n!afon of this narrow but happy efca.pe is thus de-
fined from the native's horofcopical figure of birth. In the eighth
l1oufe, which is·the houfe·of death, v;e find the benevolent planet Ju-
piter, 'vhich is an irrefragable argument that the native fhould not' die a
violent, but a natural, death. N~~.v, had Saturn or Mars been there, the
~vil naq certainly touche~ his life·. Another decifive tefiimony fo~ the
prefervation· of the native's life is, that the direElion operating comes
from a benefic planet; and, though the direaion be of an evil quality,
yet, as it is not governed by the anareta, nor by any crofs direClion either
from Saturn, Mars, or the·Sun, to the part of Fortune, it is impoffibJe,
according to the ·radical import of the fignificators, that life fhould be
deftroyed, although expofed in this remarkable manner, to the mofi
unequivoeal infirutnent of death. ' ·
I have d,velt the longer upon thefe two di.reRions, becaufe I confider
them as the moll remarkable in the whole figure; and I am fure their
effea is equally extraordinary; befides, it tends to !hew, that, in geni-
tures where the fignificators clearly demonftrate a long life and natural
death, and where no crofs malefic configuration Hrongly irradiate~
the aphetic place, however the native, in his journey through life,
may be expofed~ to the mofi immin'ent perils and dangers ; yet, if benefic
:fignificators, as in the prefep.t nativity, haye the afcendancy in point of
dignity and·c·
onfiitution·of place, he {hall fafely overcqme them all, and
enjoy life until that period of time arrives., when exhaufted nature can
no longer exercife her proper funEtions, and diffolution becomes the ne-
ceffary confequen<;e. · · ·

Thefe t\vo lafi direaions have their for~e continued in a more or lefs
fenfible degree~ until the influence of fqn1~ other direction begins to

that the fulfihnent of an·y matter or th1ng pronufed by a d1recbon 1
s
completely fanned 'vhen its afpeEt is in all rcfpeEls perfea, and the
irradiations of each contributing fiar fully complete; though, according
to the latitude of that principal fignificator by ,Nhich the direaion is
· · brought up, thejubje8 of the n1atter, or thing fo to be brought .about,
may by certain gradations of influence be fon1e time in preparation, ere
the abfolute event is really brought to pafs. For, in the cafe of n1ar-
riage, there is ufually Ion1e titne fpent in courtfhip and dalliance, before
the parties repair to th~ hymeneal altar, But, when this is perforn1e-d,
Of about tO be performed, the exaa \VOrking up of the diretlion fully de-
D10nftrates. So it is in all o ther cafes ,-vhere a matter is declared to be
brought to paf'i by the force of a d1reClion; except where a direC1ion of
a contrary qQality~ and {uperipr firength, falls in tts way, and overturns
its tendency and influence; on all \\·hich occafions the thing originally
( prediaed is fet afide, and a contrary effea takes place; as we frequent! y _
obferve in perfons betrothed, "'ho, even at the church door, or b~fore
the altar, chang~ their fentirnents, .and put the marriage afide. But, if
no fuch crofs diretlions interpofe, and a length of tiri1e occurs bet\\'een
them, then the.original· afpea holds its own proper force and quality to
th~ full.extent, and, whatever it denotes, is in a general way fully corn-
pleted, with all it~ confequences and contingent effetts.
.
Afc. *J). Under this direaion, the influence wrought by the lafl: is
brouaht to perfea maturity. A connexion with one of the ladies, which..
had fur fame time been formed, is now brought to its crifis; and, when.
this afpea was complete in all its rays, the parties were 1narried. The
perfonal defcription 'vhich this afpeB: gives of the \vif~, is of a middle
fiature, pale dark complexion, bro,vn hair, comely, and agreeable ; in
mental endowments difcreet and inP"enious, rather petulant, and worldly
minded, and therefore fufliciently f~ving and frugal. ,., ·

a half fron1 his birth, introduced to fcveral gentlemen of the firfl literary
talents and refpeaability, \\'ho prornifcd hin1 their ~atronagc and friend-

tion. viz.· the Part of Fortune to a conjunc1ion of the Dragon's tail,
fubjcEls the native to a violent fore throat and fever, occafioned by cold
taken in purfuing the objeas of the other direClion. This affiiC1ion \\·as
very fevcre, and feized the native, as he hath fince affured me, \\-·hen he

to the native of anr thing. that hath yet gone before it. It is the
harbinger of fome fudden difeaie that threatens life. And., if we con-
fider the radical import of this afpea, taken colleaively with the irra..
diations of the other planets, ana their refpe&ive pobtions and par-
ticular places jn the. figure, as they fiand influenced and impregnated
:with th~ ~mbient quality ~f the_ iigns, '":e can ha~e no ~afon to hefitate
1n our JUdgment, that this C:tffhaton will fall as tt were tnftantaneoufly,
and that it will come by fome defect in the anhnal circul~tion, or i~
the funaions of the brain, whereby· fenfation will be defiroyed, me-
mory /obliterated, or bodily motion withheld ; but the moll probable
effeEl of the three arifes fron1 the fuperior d;gnity of Saturn, who
governs this afpett; and, as .he rules the 'retentive faculty of man,
1t becotnes pretty evident ihat this dtforder fhould be a fit of the·
palfy, falli'ng upon the brain, \-vhereby the native fhould fuffer .~
privation of fen!e and rr1otion, particularly·. deHruBive , to the ideas
of. the .mind, and to the force of memory. Under this direction·
Mr. Wttchell really bad the misfortune to fall down in an apo-
pleclic ·fit,. which held l1im for fome time i.n a Hate of perfect
Jnfenfibibty, deprived of fight and motion, and of every vifible ap-
pearance of life. When 'ctrculation was reftored, and pulfation re-
turnedi the native became fenfible to pain, and re...poffeffed all the
funaions of the body ; but his memory continued for fome time w~olly
arrefied, and._was eve~ a~ter grea~ly.impaired: h~s wh<;>le frame ~elt_ the

<Q ~ 9 !\f. This direEl.ion is of a more grateful quatity, giving the
native ch~crfulncfs, and rcn1oving in lome n1eafure Ius habitual melan-
choly. 1..his dircclion naturally inclines the fancy to women, and in-
cites amorous dcfires; and 1 have no doubt but the native, even under
an itnpaired conllitution, and a confirmed nervous habit', was more
Lhan ordinarily awakened to thc(e defires during the operation of this
ilrpeEt. It \Vas, ne\·erthele(<;, too indelicate a qucfiion for me to pur,
however n1y curiofit y might havc been excited by the vtfible defignation
of the planets, or howev('r anxious I might have been to juHify the di-
reaions o'f a nativity which 'vere intended for public fcrutiny.
)) .6. o \1. This dire8ion participates <'Xtremely of the quality of
the foregoing, and they operate in many inHances with a joint influ-
ence, being.both from afpeas anade in the world, and coming up
nearly to~~cher. · The native hath certainly firon~ predile&ions in fa-
vour of lome particular female; and, if his confhtutidn was. not fame-
what impairt>d, and his mind pretty much engroffed by other concerns, I
have no kind-of doubt but he \VOuJd have rnarried again while this di-
rechon operated; but, though it gives radical import of fuch an
event, yet 'Nhen we corn~ to confider it maturely with the quality of
other planets, whofe horofcopicat places at the birth give them a con...
cern in th~ conepJ,..tion of (uch an event, 've fhall find fame few argu·
ments wanting to give it a cornptete turn in favour of a fecond matrimo-
nial engagement. But 1hat the.native had firong prepoffeffions that way
I ha\'t' not tl"e leCJU doubt, ;,nd ,~ith a-lady ,v}io perhaps is now living,
and might confirm the truth of my remark.
Afc·Ll o. This direaion is naturaHy good, inclining the native to ·
fortitudt> and perfeverance, and gives ani1nation to the fpuits, and vigour
to the mind. He will, ho\\'ever. be fornewhat abfolute and arbitrary
under it, particularly in his own family, and with his more in1n1ediate
domefiics and dependents. vVith refpt>&. to bodily infirmity, he \vill
feel an affiitlion of choler, and a feverifh tendency, induced by the qua-
]ity of Mars, who has borne ruJ~ in the three lafi direElions; and, by
thus encreafing the energy of his influence upon the fpirits, wilJ leave
them fubje& fo a flow nervous fever, deH.rutlive to the radical moi!lure
of nature, and to the free circulation of the blood and juices.

fhould form the Jafl: afpea tn this nativity, which precedes that ··of

direEl:ions which operate prior to this; and he no fooner retires, than he'
is fucceeqed by the greater .infortur:e, S'!turn, .who give~. pla-ce to the ·

!s appa~cnt, th~t., however unaccounta~le or undefinable thefe
planetary 1rrad1attons mtght appear, they cena1nly are what the Su-
preme t\uthor of all things onginally intended them to be, the natural
<1ncf efficient caufes of thofe firange and complicated ·mixtures and af-
feEl:ions in men,r \vhich have confounded the !peculations of the \\'ife!t
philofophers. And I am perfuaded that no man, unlefs it be thofe
who are \Vilfully obflinateJ can hefitat.e in forming his opinion of.the
truth of thefe pre1nilt~s; particularly after obfcrving that no rernarkable
incident of this native's life ever happened, but under the uniforn1 influ..
ence, and as it "·ere by the confent, of one or other of thefe dirctlions~
the defining of \vhich confiitutcs the only true and r.ational mode of
predtEling by, or of calculating, nativities. .
But, before I difmifs this fubjea, and in order to render every part·
of the fcience as plain as poffible, it will be proper, in this place, to
explain v;hat is meant by Revolutions and ..franfits. A revolution is a
returning or revolving back· of any one of the celellial bodies to the
fame place or point in the heavens from \vhence it firll r~ceded; for fo
the word radically imports. But, in our application of it to explain or
illuflrate any particular circumftance in a nativity, it ufualJy refers only
to the return of the Sun to his radical place in the zodtac, that is, to
• the fame degree and minute of the fign wherein he \vas pofited in the
hour of birth. For the truth is, that revolutions and tranfits more
prope:ly appertain to the f~te of empires than to the. circumflanc<:-~ of
a nauvny; It has, !lo,vever, been found, by efiabhfhed obfervauon
and long praaice, tliat the revolutions, not only of the Sun, but of alL
the other principal fignificators in a nativity, to their radical places in
the horofcope, excite a very po,verful additional influence in,the afpeEls
and direaions then operating, whether of a good or evil nature ; but

more particularly when the planet, fo falling into its radical point,
participates firongly.of the fame ·quality and temperature .as the confi-
gur~~ion or dir~aio1_1 the!1 in force. . An? ,hence i.t ·is.ufual f~. every
JDdtctous proficient 1n thts art, when he ts calculattng and br1ngtng up
the direCl:tons of a nativity, to erea revolutional figures through the
whole period.of th..e native's life, in order to obtain the mofi: fatisfaB:ory
information in the probable or/offible means, whereby !illY important
direC1ion, whether good; or ba , migh~ be increafed or diminilhed in
its natural quality· and import, by the falling in of the revolution of
any other fignificator, or of any particular planet tranfiting .the place,
under the influence of vv-hich the cufiomary effea of the direCtion may
be varied. . · .
.The· ufual way of ereEling a revolutional' figure is by adding five
hours and ·forty-eight minutes to the exaEt time of the native's birth
for ,every year's revolution ; and, when the aggregate exceeds t\ven.ty- ,
four hours, th~ twenty-four are to be caH: away. For example, I would
fet a .revolutional figure of Mr. Witchell's birth. Now the time of
the day on whic;h he was born ·was feven hours fifty-two minutes in ·
the afterno'on. The figure of birth, it mull be obferved, fiands for the
firfi year; confequently the firft revolutional figure to be fet for the na..
tive exhibits the pofitions of the luminaries and planets for the fecond
year of his age; and the feventh alfo anfwers frqin the feventh to the
eighth ; and therefore, ifwe add five hours forty-eight minutes-for every
year, caRing away the aggregate of twenty-.four hours as oft'en as the~ oc-
cur, we fhaU uniformly obtatn the precife fituatioris and precifions of.the
planets for the year required. · •

Having delineated the figure, 've are to examine how it agrees with

tors; ~nd, on the ·c?ntrary, if g~ateful and penign influences thus con..
cur, and mutually a1d and untte 1n benevolent temperatures, th~n great
and laHing g9od, according to the differ~nt natures of the planetary
caufes and effeas, will undoubtedly take place. But, to n1ake this
fomewhat more familiar to the reader's underfianding, I !hall giv.e a few
general ~ules, whereby' judgment may be determined in other ca4es.
. . .
Whenever the hyleg, or giver of life, whether it be the Sun, !\1oon,
Part of Fortune, or Afcendant, in the radix or genethliacal figure of
birth, is found to.behold its place in the revolutional ficrure, by form-
ing a fextile or trine afpea with each other, ~t is confidered a vifible .
argument that the native Jhall, during that year, enjoy he.a.lth of body,
ana that his affairs \Vill in a general way. go well; but if this afpea be
mape\ by a quartil~ or oppofiuon; the contrary effects are denoted. .So
if the Moon, in both the radix and revolutio·nal figure, be free from the
malignant rays ,of the infortunes, and· not combufi, it is likewife an
argument of an healthful and profperous year, more cfpecially if !he be
configurated with benefic Hars. But, if the· Moon be cotnbun, or af-·
fliaed with the m~lefic I~ays of Saturn or Mars, it will prove an unlucky
and fickly year. .
If, in t.he revolutional figure, an eclipfe or comet fhould fall upon
the afcendant, it threatens a year of great trouble and anxiety to the
native. But, if the eclipfe ·in the revolutional figure, \vhether of tbe
Sun or Moon, fhould fall exaaly ~n the fame degree as the hyleg, or
giver of life, in the radical figure of birth, and any violent configurati<,?n
of the malefics fhould begin to operate at the fame time, it 'viii, in ·
all probability, affea the native's life, by encreafing the malignancy of
the afpeet, and heightening the violence of the means, whatever it may
be, by which life is threatened. So, if ~n eclipfe of the Sun fhould
in like manner fall in the fame degree a'nd minute of the Dragon's
Head, it alfo endangers life; but, if it only falls near the fame point,
it then threatens danger or difeafe in that year, but not fuch as lhould
touch life. · ' ,.
If in the revolution the. Part of Fortune fa1ls in the fame degree as
in .the· radix, it is implicative of the fame effeas, and will tend to fa-·
cilitate th~m in a more eminent and ob~ious manner; and, if it happens
that this pofitio~ falls in_ a 9ood·afpea with its difpofitor, it will greatly
4
~end to encreafe the nattve s wealth or. fubfiance during that year; but

of the Pnrt of Fortune in abjca places, it portends a dirccl contrary
effcc1. It is, ho\vevcr, ahvays to be rememben.
·d, that any planet
Hrong and cHc:ntialJy dignified in a revolution, and at the fan1e ttmc in
good "fiJc& \\'ith the Part of Fortune, or ,._,ith the lord of the fccond
hou(c, or 'vith Jupiter, Venus, or the Moon in reception, uniformly
prcfagcs good fortune to the native during that year. .,
I
If the Sun be in the firfl houfc, mid-heaven, or eleventh houfc of
the rcvolutional figure, in good afpca \Vith Jup!ter or Venus in the
radix, and free fro1n the unbenign r~diations of the infortuncs, it de-
notes an incrcafe of honour and reputation, of refi>ea and cHcen1,
during that year, althou!?h no direaion \Vhatever {hould be then ope-
rating to increa{e its influence. So .Jupiter, \\·ell configurated in the
afcendant, ~#I· in Pifccs, Cancer, or Sagittarius, indicates the fame, ac-
cording to the quality and occupation ot 'the native; but he denotes
honour and cU.een1 in a much more e•ninent degree \vhen pouted in the
mediun1 cceli. O,r, if the revolutional afcen dant be the place of the
Dragon's Ht:'ad in the radix, and irradiated by Jupiter, it Jike\vifc pro-
motes honour, and encreafes \Vorldly eHeem ; and fo, vice vetfa, if the
afcendant of the radical figure of birth be the place of the Dragon's
Head in the revolution, it denotes the fame.
If in the revolutional figure the luminaries are conjoined in the fe-
venth .or fourth houfe, it prefages death either to the father or mother
of the native; more efpecially if their places in the radical figure be
likewife infortunated by malignant rays. If Saturn be found to affl1R
the Sun by quartile or oppofition, or by conjunaion in one .of the an-
gular houfes, it is an argument that the father fhall make his exit, but,
if the Moon· be thus aH1iaed by Saturn, 'vith relative pofitions in the
t\VO horofcopes, it prefages death to the mother; for in thefe cafes the
Sun is natural fignificator of the father, and the Moon of the mother;
and, 'rhen, thus configurated in a revolutional figure, they forbode
death to happen \\'ithin·the year. .
vVhenever the lord of the fifth is pofited in the afcendant, or the lord
of the afcendant in the fifth houfe of the revolutional figure, and in a
fruitful fign, 'rith due affinity to the radix, it is a moll: propitious con-
figuration to give the native illue, if n1arried; but, if fingle, it \Vill be a
very dangerous year to the native, by intercourfes \\"ith the other fex.-
lf the native be anlale, he will tnoH: probably have an illegitinlate off-
fpring to proYide for; but, if a female and a virgin, fhe \\·ill rarely

efcape ruin, and will pro~ably be~ome th~ unproteCled mother. of an
unfortunate orphan. Thts afpea ts therefore to be regarded ·wtth the
utmoft attention, and refifie.d with becoming fortitude and refolution by
both fexes.
/
~
If the lo.rd of the fift~ be p9fited in the twelfth, (it being the eighth
from the fifth,) in fimilar af,EeB: to the radix, it th.reatens death to the
native's 'children. So likewife if Saturn or Mars, or .t~e Dragon's Tail,
be pofited in the fifth houfe~ of the revolutional -
figure, in evil afpeEt ·
with .'the radix, it forbodes death~ to the native's iffue in the courfe of
that. yea~. Or if·~aturn or Ma.rs a~~a t~e fifth houfe or its lord by
conJtlnctton, quartile, or oppofiuon, It 1mphes the fame.

· Whene,~er the lord of the afcendant, in the revolutional :&gure, is po-
fited in the feventh houfe, and comes by diretlion to the radical place of
Venus in the figure of birth ; or if the lord of the feverith, in the revo-
lution, is brought by dire£:tion to the afcendaht of the radix, they afford
ample proofs that ~he native \viii marry in the courfe of that year. Or
if Jupiter, Venus, the Moon, or Part of Fortune, be thus irradiated, it'
denotes a propenfity i!J the native to contraa matrimony, although cir-
cumfiances might occur to prevent it.
' '
, Whenever Sa.turn is pofited in the feventh houfe of the radix, and
found alfo in the feventh houfe of the revolution, it threatens death to·
th~ native's \vife before the expiration of that year. Mars and the Dni-·
gon's Tail thus configurated, imports little lels. Mercury, if affliRed
by the.malevolents, and in the feventh houfe, declares much danger to ·
the native ; but, if configurated "rith Venus, under the fame mahgnant
rays, it threatens mifchief both to the native and his wife. I
Mars, Mercury, and Venus, being the proper fignificators of pro-
feffion, if they are affiiaed in the revolutional ~gure, with d~retl affinity
to the fame places in the rarl1x, prefage great forrow and embarrallment
to the native tn his line of bufinefs during that year. But a cornet ,
or eclipfe falling upon... the mid-heaven of the radix and revolution,
irradiated by the·good afpeas of either the Sun or Mars, wilLproduce
a very profperous year to the native, and will bring him honour and
preferment.

or behold the radical figure of birth. There is now another cffrCl to
be confidered, which the erratic fiars proCluce by their rcfpeaive a
notions
round the ~un, \vhich are called tranftts, that is, a returning to or ·
rc-aflurning either their O\\·n place, or the place of any .other planet in
the rcvolutional figure, fo as exaaly to corrcfpond \'lith thLir radical
places in the figure of birth. Thefc tranfits, when of a remarkable or
e1ninent nature, always produce an t·ff(··a or influence of their own,
peculiar to the nature and quality of that particular Har by \\'hich fuch
tranfits are made; but vvheuever they fall in places of the figure, or in.
configuration \Vith other planets, wb~rc a direaion is comtng up, or
any diH ina afpeR then operating, they never· fail to co-operate with,
and give additional force and clncacy to, fuch afpe84\ or dire&ions,
\\'hether good or evil, a~ the cafe and qua1ity of th~ feveral fignificators
fhall happcn to be. And for thi~ reafon H is highly proper, \vhcnever
the fpeculurn of a nativ1ty is projetled, and the vanous direaions
brought up, to examine ·what tranf,ts are likely to occur in lhfl' courfe
of the native's life that may poffibly vary t~e efieEt o( any panicular
direction ; and, coufequently. of the inctdents or events predicted there..
by, as likely to happen to the native. For this reafon I have annexed a
fe,v gen~ral obfcrvations, calculated to direct the reader's judgment un...
der this fpeculutn.
'\'hen Saturn returns to or tran!i ts his o'''n radical place in the revo-
lutiona} figure, \\'ell dignified, he indicates profperity to the native; and,
if he be lord of the afcendant either in the radical or revolutional horo-
fcopc, he w·ill render that profperity fhll more excellent and confpicu-
ous. If Saturn tranfits thf' rac}.ical place of Jupiter, propitioufiy confi-
gurated, it denotes incre~de of fortune by the favour of eminent men;
if he tranfits the place of Mars, it gives advantages from friends or bre-
thren; and, if thefe tranfirs are made vvith evil configurations, the con...·
trary evils \vill be produced.
vVhen Saturn tranfits the place of the Sun, it is implicative of fame
firong or violent contention \Vith magifl:rates, or ·with 1nen in po,ver, in
the courfe ·of that year; and, if accompanitd ,virh afpefu of dileafe,
\viii produce. bodily ficknefs and infirmity. If Saturn trcanfits the place.
of \Tenus, it den1onllrates infelicity frotn a female caufe ; if the place
of Mercury~ it implies advantages from fludy; if the place of the
Moon, it d•:clares affiiclion both 0f the body and mind; if the place
of the Dragon's I-:Iead, it tends to pron1ote the native's g-ood fortune;
but, if Saturn tranfits the place of the Dragon's 'fail, tt has a. moH
dangerous
,

.dangerous and malignant tend.ency. If the place o~ the Part ?f Fo~­
tune be tranfited by Saturn, \Vtth benevolent rays, 1t denotes tncreafe
of fub!lance and eHate; but, if by evil rays, the contrary effea \vill be
produced. ·
Precifelv the fame is the refult of all ~he other fignificators tranftt-
incr their "o,vn or other planets' places in the radical or revolut'ionaL
ho~·ofcopes; 'vith only this invariable diHin£lion, that the effetls vary
according to the nature, quality, and temperature, of each refpeElive
planet, and to the radiations and afpeas formed ""·ith then1, or to the
direB:ions then operating; for revolutions or tranfits of a benevolet~t
and friendly nature, falling in with good direClions then operating,
will vifibly increafe their propitious quality, and greatly benefit the
11ative; whiHt, on the other hand, revolutions or tranfit>s of an evil de-
.. fignation, falling in with noxious. and malignant direElions, will en-
creafe_
the evil, or defiroy life. But good revolutions or tranfits falling in
with bad direEt.ions n1ollify their malignancy; 'vhilfi evil ones, oppofcd
to good direElions~ leflen the good fortune then operating, and deprive
the native of the full completion of thofe golden advantages. \Vhich per-
haps appeared almoft within his grafp.
To difcover the precife tirne when any ~v~nt or direC1ion fhall take
place in a revolutional figure, we dirett the five hylegiacals, as in the
radix; always obferving, as it is for the year en ruing, to direl:l the tem-
porary progrefs of the zodiac for five hours forty·eight minutes. For
infiance, fuppo!e the cufp of the medium cceli hath one degree ofGemini,
that point is to be direEled to every afpecl that falls betv\reen that one de--·
gree and twenty...four degrees of Leo; and alfo. ,f the afcendant hath at
the fa1ne ti1ne eight degrees of Virao it mufl be direB.ed to all promit:
tors between that point and nine d~grees· of .bcorpio, becaufe that point
will be upon the cufp of the afcendant for the enfuing year, and Leo
will occupy the mid-heaven. In like tnanner the Sun, Moon, and
Part of Fortune, mufl: be directed unto their promittors, always remem-
~ering, that the diltance o~ a planet from the afcendant is found by ob-
. l1que afcenfion, and from the 1111d-heaven by right afcenfion. l)ut, when
one planet is clireaed to another for the purpofe of afcertaining tranfits,
their diflances from each .
otherare found, by oblique afcenfio.n or defcen-
fion, under the pole of that planet which is taken for fignificator; and
the difia~ce w~ich is tl:us given hr degrees inufl be c~nverted into tit?-e_,

I have now· completed every remark and eycry infiruClion that is or
can be neccffary for the perfeB: CCll~ulation of nativitie~; and I arq
bold to fay, that \\'hoever will beHo\v fufficient tin1c and application to
the rules I have Jaid dov!n, and that\vill attend properly to the colla-
~eral c!rcun1Hances, \Viii ~nd no difficulty in obtaining·a forekno\vlcdge
of all rnaterial events :r~latin~ to .himfelf, or to any other perfon, v.;hole
real nativity is laid before Jljtn. J have, in the n1anage1nent .of the
foregoing nativity of Mr. W~t~hell, been particularly plain and copious,
that no underfl:anding miaht go uninfortned, as well of the fimplicity
and verity of the art, as o? its moral tendency to pron1ote the good of
n1ank;nd, and the. certainty ·with :w·hich human events n1ight be fought
out through its n1eans.
E \'ery thing I have fiated with refppa to Mr. Witchelrs nativity is
incontrovertible faa. 1-hat gentlen1an, w~~n in perfe~ health, anq
· in full vigour of 1nfnd, reforted to me for no other purppfe t}lan to

.perfeEt mathematician of the age; and bec~ufe hts convt0:Ion and .ap-
probation of it would ftamp new reputation upon a fctence, whtch,
having.few or no real advocates, has been long borne .down by popular
prejudice and obfi.inate declam~tion.' Hav~ng performed ~very part of
the calculation Wlth an exaattude that htghJy P.leafed htm, ~e made
ufe of it as a friendly monitor of the good and evtl that awaited the re-
fidue of his days ; and, when he_approached towards the fiated time of
bis diffolution, he would mention it '\\·ithout the fmalleft emotion, and
c.onfider~d the kno\vledge o~ it ·as O?e of th~ greateR bleffings of h~s
hfe; wh1ch not ·only drew his attention ~o hts Maker, and fixed· his
thoughts upon celefiia1 defires, but raifed his mind above the contem-
r.lation ~f .earthly enjoyments, and gave ferenity and calmnefs to his
converfation and deportment. It was on one of the{~ occafions, that
he ·requeUed me to print his nativity in my work, which l began
to publifh fome little time before; obferv_ing that. t~e evi.dence of fo
recent and refpeaable a proof of afirologtcal pred1t11on mtght tend to
bring mankind to reafon, and admonifil' them no longer to abandon this
fublime-and interefl:ing branch of knowledge. -·
And now, \vhat need can there be of further argument in fupport of
fo felf-evident a doClrine? Or what advantage could it pofiibly be to
me, or. to any difinterefied man, to preach up the advantages of a fci-
ence which hath no exiflence in reafon or in truth ? The faEts here
laid do\Vn are unque!lionable; and fuch, I think, as no reafonable man
will attempt ~o refute. If farther proofs are required, I fhall at
all times be ready to furnifh themf or to explain any tnatter or thing
l1erein before laid .down that might be deemed unintelligiblet or that
is not thoroughly underfiood; at the fame time that, if any obHinate
unbeliever, or any other delcription of men, can offer a fair and candid
argument in oppofition to a!lral influence, I !hall be ready to hear them
with refpea and attention. Wretched indeed fhou1d I be, if, after
every precaution to guard myfe]f againfi the encroachments of .enthu-
fiafm, I llioufd fall a viaim to its phrenzy, or be deemed a madman
or a fool: .at the fame time let me not fhut my eyes againft demon-
ftrable facls, merely becaufe the bulk of mankind chufe to difcounte-
nance tbern, or determine to b.ecome wilfully blind. I have examined,
and am convinced; and I frufi I have fufficiently efiablilhed the reality
of this fcience; and have abundantly fhewn that the ambient matter,
colleaed by.the rays of the cele!lial bodies, and co~municated by a

undcfcribablc occurrences in hutnan nature, \\·hich, for \\·ant of a rnoJc

attributed to caufcs, \vhich calJ in qucflion the .benign au ribute.~ of the
Deity, and difgracc the underfianding of the 1ncancfi of his creatures

It hath been contended by fomc, in oppofition to that part of afiro-
Iogical doarine, \vhich dctennines the bodilr fonn ~!Jl<1 rnental d;fpo-
fitton of the native, from the fevernl fignificators in his O\\·n, and in his
parents' genethliacal figures, that this likencfs or fimilitude in hod,r and
tcn1per, is fiamped by the energy or idea of the parents in the aa of
copulation. Although I am \villing to adtnit this obfcrvation in part,
yet I contend that the primary caufe 'vhich furni01es that energy or
tnotion in the parents, is derived fro1n their rcfpcElive fignificators in
the heavens; and that they imprefs their particular quality, in propor-
tion as they happen to be in dignity and pow·cr at that precifc time. If
the fignificators of the tnother are then fuperior in force and dignity..
the mother's features and difpofition \'lill be mofl vifiblc; if the fa-
tller's geniture be the firongeU, the father's temper anc.l fimilitude ,..·ill
be moil predominant in the offspring then begotten; but if both their
fignificators are equally firong, the child then equally participate~ in
the likenefs and difpofition of both his parents. Let it neverthclefs be
rrmetnbered, that, ho\vever /lrong the fignificators of both or either of
the parents might be, yet thofe proper to the fretus or conceptional
matter invariably take the lead, and fiamp that peculiar form and tenl-
perature upon the native, \vhich in a great tncafure fupplant the fir£1:
impreffions given by thofe of the parents, and form a perfon and tnind
effentially differing from both, thou~h \Vith fome vefiiges of hereditary
fimi1itude.. And hence the reafon w•IY fons and daughters more or Jefs
depart fron1 the fiature, feature, complexion, and temper, of their
parents ; and \vhy no t\vo human beings, in the '\\?hole compafs of ge-
neration, "·e.re e\~er yet formed prec(flly alike I If, therefore, the n1an
lives, who can fairly and con1pletcly refute this argurnent, he !l1all
J1ave my thanks and my applaufe. 1\.nd I \viii add further, in the enl-

OBSERVATIONS on the NATIVI~Y of the Rev. GEORGE
WHITFIELD, M. A.
I fl1all no\v, aCTreeable 'to the ,plan I have before laid down, introduce,
by '\Vay of exatnple, a_number of remarkable genitures, in order tO fl1e'v
that the afpetls of the planets, an~ the· influenc:e of direCtions, are
uniformly and invariably the fatne in all cafes, and correaly diflingui1h
thofe extraordinary aCtions in.every native's life, for which he after\v·ards
beco1nes celebrated and famous. , .
. The well-k.nO\\~n life and charaEler of .the Rev. Mr. Whitfield, ~nd
his ~emarkable pro\vefs in the line .he adopted, render him no unfit
fubjea for. our prefent purpofe. He was born on the 16th of Decern-
. ber, 17J 4, as in the annexed plate of his geniture. At a very early
period of his life, he loft his father, and was left unprovided for in the
world. \N'hen he arrived at the age of ten years, his mother again con-
traCted matrimony, which turned out very unhappy ; which ts detnon-
ftrated by the mid-heaven·coming at this time to a contra antifcion of
the Moon; and, as both are fignificators of the mother, they prefage· ·
mueh trouble and anxiety as 'veil to her, as to the native. At fourteen,
l1e 'vas taken from fchool, and affified his mother in the bufinefs of a
public houfe·; at which tirne the mid-heaven came to a quartile of the·
Sun, which always brings difgrace and.· trouble: His mother quitting.
the inn, it was taken by his brother ; and his fifier-in-law and himfelf
not agreeing, they frequent1y fell out, and he would fometimes not
fpeak to her for three weeks together. 1...hs fullen aufiere temper is.
produced in the radix of his birth, by the quartile of the Sun and1
Mars ; , a~d, to complete the obflinate perfeverance of his mind, the~
Ivloon is in conjun8ion of Saturn, ,vhi<::h invariably produces f 1ch a
temperature.
t '
In fifteen years and twelve aays from his birth, the M.:oon came to·
the trine of Venus, who is the fignificatrix of joy and pleafure. It js a,
remarkably good direCtion, by falling in the eleventh houfe, which de-
notes friends.; and,. as '!enus is- in the third, it relates to kindred,. and

fl1ort journC'ys. Under this dircBion it \VilS rcfolvcd to fit the native for
the univerfity; hut llt· \\"Cnt on fo1nc vilits of plcafurc, before he con-
figned himfeJr to the difciplinc of n preparatory fchool. At the age of
fevcnteen years and one hundred and eighty·cight days, the ~'loon came
to a bodily afpcR \\'tlh l\1ars.. This tliret1aon huth an evil fignification,
becaufe thefc t\VO planets nrc by nature inirnical to each other, as '"'e
have already {uflicicntly fhc,vn; and it wouJd have had a much more
Jllalignant influence, had not venus. nt the fame time caft her trine af-
pea to l\1ars. Under this direElion be contraacd an intimate ac9uaint-
ance with fcveral debauched young gentlemen, who led him' tnto ar
variety of fcrapes, and into the 'vicked company of proflitutcd females.
At about eightf'en years of age he 'vas received into the univcrfity; for
~·hich there can1e up a rnofl: fignificant dire&ion of the afcendant to the
trine of Jupiter, which hath reference t·o preferment under the nobility,
clergy, religious focietie~,. and fuch-Iikc. Under this dirca·ion he 'vas
cho!en fervitor to feveral gentlemen of the univerfity, whereby he con-
duaed his pecllninry affairs fo wciJ, that he did not fiand his friends in
t'venty..four pounds in three years. At the period of eighteen years t'•:o
hundred and fifty-fix days, the Sun catne to the trine of Saturn ; under
'~lhich direaion the native abandons the efl.ablifhed dotlrines of the
church, and takes up the religious tenets of Methodifrn, to the utter
afioniflunent and concern of all his relations and friends. At nineteen
years t\VO hundred and forty-four days, the Sun again came to the trine
of Saturn; under which direaion the native more vigoroufiy purfued
his religious principles, and becarne intimately acquainted 'vith the
Rev. John Welley, by vvhofe friendly advice and exemplary condutl he
ufed frequently to fay, " he had been delivered fron1 the fnarcs of
Satan."
At nineteen. years one hundred and twenty-fix days from the time of
birth, the lnid..hcaven came to the oppofition of Jupiter. At this
time many infelicities arife by means of clerical men. The nntive's
mind is tormented and oppreffed, and he is loaded with calumny and
conten1pt. He incurs the difplcafure of the heads of his college; his
relations alfo confpire againfi him, and his 1nind becon1es a prey to per-
turbation and defpair. This laid the foundation· of a violent fit of fick-
nefs, \vhich laflcd him up,vards of fevcn \reeks, ,,.,·hilfi. this direElion
operated 'vith its utmofi force~ his life \vas fuppofed to be in danger,
and his enemies rejoiced in his affiiClion. 1\.t t\\'enty years and n,·o dars,

direaion he was rcfiored to health, and recovered his wonted refulution
and fpirits. ·
At ~\venty years and t\\·o 11u_ndred and eighty-~x days fron1 l1i~ birth,
the n11d-heaven came to the trnie of Venus, whtch produced han the
Encere regard of n~any pe-r{ons, '\vith health and content, and profperity
in \Vordly affairs. Under this direRion the native journeyed to Glou-
cefier, and .foon after\vards to Britlol ; . in the· courfe of which he ex-
perienced many offices of friendfhip from thofe whom he had confidered
his enemies. Lady Selwyn, of Gloucefier, recommended him to the
patronage of the Bifhop, who immediately fent for him, and offered to
ordain him when~ver he defired; and at t}fe fame time prefented hin1
with five guineas. And the next direaion coming up at twenty years
three hundred and fixty days from the tin1e of birth, namely, on the
12th ofDecen1ber, i 735, greatly encreafed the good fortune promifed
by the former; for under. the influence of. this direB:ion, Sir John
Phillips agreed to allo·w· him thirty ppunds a-year.
.At twenty-one years and eighty-feven days, 14th March, 1736, the
afcendant came to the fextile of Venus. While this direaion 'vas ope...
rating, it gave the native a pleafant and agreeable time, full of profpe-
ri~y and content, with reputation and [uccefs in his vo_
cation ; fo that in
· May fo~lowing he was ordained. What renders this direaion rnore re-
marl<ably propitious is, that it falls in a good part of the horofcope,
and that Venus is no way af!Iiaed. In Augufi following he returned to
London. ·
\Vhen he was twenty-one years three hundred and forty days old, i. e.
on the-22d of November, 17.~6, the Moon came by direaion to Spica
Virginis_, a fixed fiar of the firfi magnitude. Fixed fiars of a benevo-
lent, quality, in fuch conjunB:ions, ufually denote fudden honour and
preferment, and frequently bring men into higher repute than any fingie
erratic influence; but, 'vhen mixed '\\l"ith planets of their o'vn nature
and· guali_ty, they giv~ durable reputation and profperity, as was -.the
cafe In the pre!ent In!lance. At twenty-two r years and twenty-four
days from the_ birth, namely, on the 10th of January, 1737, the Sun
came to the tnne of the :rvt:oon from the tenth houfe, the houfe of pro-
feffional honour; and as the Moon is fignificatrix of the n1ixed multi..
tude, or cotntnon people; it declares that the native fhould experience
an uncomn1o~ !hare of honour and refpea frotn the tniddle clafs of peo-
ple, \vhich every .one kno\vs w~s really the cafe. This afpetl: 1ike,vifc

tl1c n~tive acquired grPaL popular app1aufe, as he hath dcclnrcd hirnfclf;.
and at this tin1c he preached in the parifh.churches. On the 30th of
October IoiJo,ving, the alccndant can1c to the fcxtilc of \Tenus, which
prorni{es fuccrfs; and, by rcnfon that fo tnany benevolent dircaion')
follo\\p fo clofely after one another at this juntturc, his· fucccfs became
n1orc rapid and confpicuous. On the 1oth of December the afccndant
ca1nc to the fextjle of ~Iars; and on the 28rh of the fan1c month the
native en1barked for Geor()'ia. 'fhis dircElion brings hirn into the fo-
ciety of n1ilitary men, \rith '"hon1 harn1ony and attachment ic; mofl
an1ply denoted by the fextile afpeEL It like\vife gives the native fuitable
1nagnani1nity, fortitude, and courage.
The next dircaion is of a very dangerous and evil import, namelv,
the 1nediun1 creli to the body of ~'Iars, \Vhich, geuethhacally confidered,
fuddenly expofes a native to the mifchance either of life or forrunc ; it
fl.irs up the \\~rath of powerful men againU bin1, and excites his 2ninrl
to popular tumults. and cotnmotions. 1'his \vas in an extraordinary n1an-
ner exemplified· in the perfon of ~1r. \\1hitficld ; for under this dircEiion
he returned to England, landed at Brifio], and behaYcd \'lith great ar-
rogance to the chancellor of that diocefe; and after\\·ards infultc d and
rebuked the vice-chancellor of Oxford, and contemned his authority,
'\\?ith that of all the other dignitaries of the church. I-Ie \\·as no'v
prohibited fron1 performing divine fervicc in any of the protcfiant
churches; in confequence of vvhich he cotnn1encedfit'/d prrdrher, in the
neighbourhood of Kingf,vood, near Brifiol. In February, 17.'39, the af-
ceodant came to the conjunEl:ion of Mercury, at ,~·hich tin1e he \\'as fcized
\\~ith a violent.fever, and continued \·ery ill uP'';ards of {ix \\'CcJ.~s.
At t\\·enty-four years and feventy-eight days fron1 the native's birth,
~1arch 5, the mid-hcave!l came to the body of 1\Iercurr, ruler of the
tenth houfe; fo that, not\vithflanding the oppofltion and cenfure he 1nct
\fith, yet he \\·as reinarkabry fuccefsfu1, and received gre,tt· encourage-
ment from the populace, as this diretliori obviouOy denotes. Under its
operation he preached 'openly in Hlington church-yard, then at ~loor­
fields, after\\'ards at Kennington Con1rnon, and at fcyeral other plac_es
in the open fields round London. ']..he t!ovelty of hi;; doflrine and dc-
portrnent excited public curiofity, and the populace flocked to hear hin1
frorn all quarters. He colleEied large fuxns of 1noney daiJy, in the
fonn of a fubfcription for building tha Orphan I-Ioufc in Georgia; for

'vhich purpofe the- trufl:ees had granted him five hundred acres of land
for ever. This direaion likewife Inclines the native to travel, and under
its influence he embarked for Georgia in Augufi, but returned to England
again in March, 1741. .. '
From the thirty-fecond to the thirty-fixth year of the native's age,
th~re happen four remarkably good direaions, viz. the Part of Fortune
t9 the conjunction of the Moon, the S!Jn to the fextile of Jupiter, the
Sun to the conjunaion of Venus, and the Sun to the trine of Mars.
Under thefc feveral direaions he confiderably encreafed h~s fubfl:ance, grew
daily into higher repute amongfi his difciples, and publifhed feveral traEts
that met with univerfar approbation. He likewif~ under this influence
married the widow of an apothecary in Wales, with a fmall landed_
efiate. On tht;.27th of June, 1751, the Sun came to the trine of Mars·;
und~r which direction he colleaed large fums of money, and completed
his tabernacle in Moorfields.

·
At the age of forty-two years and fixty-eight days, March 4, 1757·
the afcendant came to the quartile of the Moon, an evil direflion, pre-
faging much mifchief. , The native was now publ·icly molelled and
abufea by the populace. He was driven from the chapel in Long Acre
with indignanr- violence; and in feveral of thefe popular tun1ults he·
narrovvly efcaped with his life. He embarked for Ireland under the
evil influence of this direaion, where he in vain atternpted to gain pro-
felytes to his doarine. The populace were in a lliort time irritated againft
• him; and after feveral fruitlefs,efforts to fubdue the paffions and fpirits ·
of his auditors, and after patiently enduring a copious fhare, of infult
and abufe, accompanied with fome fevere chaftifement, he re-Ianded in
England, and came back to purfue his fortune in Londo·n.
•
.~t the age of forty-two y~ars two hundred· a~d fifty-feven days, ~he
mtd-heaven came to the fexttle of the Sun, which is an afpeet denoting
.. much good. Under.this dire&ion he found himfelf well received by tpe
populace; he refumed his former places of public declamation, and
'vent rou~d the.country, preac.hing in t~e open fields, or public Hreets,
as beft fu1ted h1s purpofe. Hts colleEhons upori thefe occafions _
were
generally pretty liberal, particularly in places where his doarine and
manner were novel, and he gained OY.er many difciples. He returned
to town> and under this benevolent direaion he built his chapel in 1...ot-
tenham-Court Road. '

At forty.five years one hundred and eighteen days from the tirnc of
birth, viz. April 17, 1 760, the Moon can1e to the quartile of \ ' cnu1.
·rhis direttion falls in the twelfth houfc, anJ is the forerunner of anguifh
and aflliEtion. At this time Footets comedy of the Minor made its ap-
pearance, \vhich fo fiigmatized the nativels charaacr, that he never got
the better of it. He devoted hitnfclf to the tafk of preaching it do,vn,
and perfcvered for a long \vhilc in this fruitlefs attempt; but the infuJt
and f:.tire of the populace \\"as fo great, that he was under the neceffity
of withdrawing himfelf frorn the performance of divine fervicc even in
his own chapefs. At this time Jikewlfe many of his principal follower$
deferted him, particularly adiflinguifhed lady, from whom he had received
very great fupport. This direCtion is immed!ately follo,ved up by the
Part cf Fortune ro the oppofition of Jupiter, a baneful afpea, 'vhich
came up the 2oth of May, 1760, and alfo declares lofs of reputation and
fubfiance to the native. Under this direfiion feveral others of his mofi.
opulent difciples abandoned him, and the pecuniary en1oluments of his
chapels were greatly decreafed•
. In September, 1764, the Part of Fortune came by direBion to .the
bodily afpe& of Mars, which hath fignification of many ·violent conten-
tions between the native and his adherents about the ]oaves·and fifhes;
\Vith lofs of property and refpea in confequence. 1'he next afpea
came up the 5th of ·December following, that is, in forty· nine years
three hundred and fifty-three ·days from .the time of birth, \vhen the
mid-heaven, which reprefents the native,s honour and reputation, comes
to the quartile of \Tenus in the. twelfth houfe. l"'his is a malignant
direCtion, calculated to blafi the native's general charatler, and to pro-
duce fome fudden evil from a female quarter. Thefe fucceffive direc-
tions, being. fraught with difappointments and infurmountable perplexi-
ties to the native, prepared his mind. to feek an afylum in the more grate-
ful climes of America.
At fifty years one hundred and eighteen days from the time of birth,
the afcendant came to the conjunEtion of the Sun, anrl is th~n brought
to a quartile afpea \Vith Jupiter, in an equally-nlalignant radiation of
the Moon. The union of thefe afpeCl.'\ is extremely fingular, as is the
manner in which the Hyleg and Anan~ta are h~re b1 ought iogether, hy
the united force of three co7operating malevolent diretbons, all of ,,·hirh
came up in September, 1770, and deprived this t·t-lebraterl charaf.ler of
life, on the 1 Sth day of that month, at Newbury, near BoHon, in
America.

nus in the ninth houfe, in trine to Jupiter lord of the ninth, infpires
hin1 \Vith a confcientious tnind, formed for divinity ; Ivlars in conjunc-
tion \vith J.Vlercury gives him a depth ofjudgtnent and an acutenefs of
reafoning fitted for the law; and, as Venus is in conjunaion \vith .n.Jars
and tlre ~1oon, at the farne time that Jupiter beholds l\1ars and Mercury
\rith a trine afpeEl:, and Mars being lord of the tenth houfe, ,.;ith the
Sun exalted therein, thefe are fo many decifive arguments to 01C\\·, that, had
the native been profeffionally bred to the law·, he \vould not only haye
acquired an immen{e fortune, but \\"Ould have increafed likc,rifc in re-
putation and charaCter. That he \'lOulcl haYe rnade an excellent phyfi-
cian, is every \ray obvious. Jupiter, lord of the fixth, the houfe of
pharn1acy and phyflc, is in Scorpio, a phyfica] fign, and is dignified in
the fiftl), the houfe of profperity·and pleafure; and being in partile

ccption, at the fa1ne tirne that he_is forming a fex~ile afpea with Saturn,
lord of the feventh, thefe are evtdent demonfirations of a perfon born
with the heavenly art of healing; and who, like the good Samaritan,
not only poffefles the ability, but the difpofition likewife, of affording
relief to his ''rounded or affliB:ed fello"'-creatures.
This native is not only born with an .extraordinary·talent for either of
the foregoing profeffions, but bath, in a mofi eminent degree, the gift
of acquiring univerfal knowledge; poffeffing from -nature a .flrong reten-
tive faculty, a quick and lively perception, and a fruitful genius, apt for
every kind of fiudy, and formed for invention. In fiature he is but
fhort, as is defcribed by the Sun in Aries ; brown hair, grey eyes, full
round features, and of a mild and placid difpofition ; though given to be
fatirica) upon the la;dies, as·is demonfirated by Mars being in conjunCtion .
lvith Venus and Mercury in his detriment.
' -
That the native might obtain preferment in the church, is abundantly
evident, from the pofitions .of fo many planets in his ninth houfe; and
therefore an excellent profeffion for him to follow, provided he would
fum up refolution to fet afide the diffipating rays of Mercury. I only
fubn1it this as a friendly hint to the native himfelf, who being alive., and
p~!Tef!ing the ability of analyfing his own geniture, ~nd _of fo~e~eeing.

a man \Vho has a firong natural propenfity to acquire knowledge, as is
proved by the Moon's pofition in the ninth houfe, the houfe of fcience,
in fextile to Mercury, in her O\Vn dignities. The fign Scorpio afceod-

ing in the eafi, and Mars and Leo in trine of \.Te_
nus in Aries, declare
liirn to be of a well-for_u1ed body, and of a tniddling fiature; of an open
. generous difpofition, and fair and jufi in all his dealings, which is parti-
cularly defcribed by Jupiter being in his O\Vn dignities, and in a good
afpeB: ,vith the Sun.
With regard to the native's fubfiance, if we confider his birth, we
{hall find it has increafed in a true proportion with what is pron1ifed
by. the fignificators in his genethliacal horofcope. The Part of For-
tune is well fituated in the fecond houfe ; the Moon is like,vife pofited
in her O\vn houfe, increafing in light and rnotion ; Jupiter, vvho is
lord of the fecond, the houfe of fubfiance, and difpofitor of the Part
of Fortune,. is conjoined 'vith the Moon's fortunate node; and, hav-
ing dignities in the fifth apd fixth houfes, prenotes that the native
fhould derive advantages from fuch things as particularly relate to
thofe houfesJ which are (uiiy explained in page 165, &c. but, as thefe
fignificators are all of them either in fiery or watery figns, it is apparent
that fuch occupations as are more immediately under the government
and controul of thofe figns '\vould b~ found mofl: profitable for the native
to foJlo,v.
•
We might eaf;ly perceive that this native is not of a clofe and fordid
-difpofition, owing princioa11y to the retnarkable configurations of the
Moon, in quartile of Ve~us, in fextilc \Vi.th Mercury, and \Vithin orbs
of an oppofition of Saturn. The force of thefe predominant qualities,
\vhile under the particular direaion of each refpeaive afpett, "vill in-
cline the native to be profufe, and carelefs about money-matters ; will
expofe him to the impofition of the crafty and defigning, and eventu-
ally to the lofs of property, and the diminution of his fubfiance, unlefs
a great degree of fpirit and refolution be exerted, to modify and correct
this good-natured, but fatal, propenfity. -A hint to the v-w~ife is ufually
fufJicient; and as this native is fiill living, and extenfively furrounded
with friends, I '"ould by no means wifh to hurt his feelings or draw
do,\·n upon myfelf the refentment of thofe, who might have it in con-
templation to take advantage of the native's generofity.
But to return. The third houfe is the houfe of journeys; and here
we find the malevolent planet Sa.turn retrograde. This is a fure argument,
that change of refidence, and journeys in general, fho'illd prove unfuc..
cefsful and injurious to 'the native, etther tn the pocket, or by bodily
a{HiElion, or both, and fhou1d therefore be avoided as mtich as poflible.

The fourth houfe bears dcfignation of the prir:cip~l fcooc and end of
the native's life. !n this :1nglc ,,.c find the fixed fign Aquarius ; and,
as Saturn is pofite~l in that lign, it is an a~gu1ncnt that fon1e houfcs or

being retrograde, fbe\\"S that this patrintony 01all not be poflc{fc~cl until
the native is far advanced in years, or in the latter fiage of his life..
..fhe fiftli houfc denotes advantages to be obtaineri, or Joffcs to be fuf.
fcred, by any fpecies of adventure ; and, as the Moon's fortunate node
falls in this hbufr, it is apparent that the native lli?uld in a genera_) 'r~y

AN ILLUSTRATION'
According to thefe pofitions of the planets, and. to. the _direa~~ns­
vthere,vith their afpeas ar~ feverallY. br?ught up, \Vtll the Infirm~ttes..
and tnisfortunes of this native be refpetl1veJy found. At about etgh-
te~n years of age, nan1ely, w·hen Venu~ perfet!:ed her mundan~ para~lel
wtth the Sun· and iviercury, he was affhEted wah a long and VIolent In-
termittent fever. At tw·enty-four years of age, he had artother violent
fever, \vhich produceci the tneafles. 1~his was brought on by the _
ba]e...
ful configuration of Satur~ ;in oppofition of Mars, l?rd _of tJle afcendant,
, and was io powerful and ~1olent, owtng to Saturn betng tn hts o\vn houfe,
and coming at the fame t1me to a mundane parallel of Mars, tha,t no per...
fon \Vhatever expeeled his life; nor could· he have furvived fo fevere an
attack, had the hylegiacal and anaretical fiars been united in the configu-
ration, to the want of which we can alone attribute the prefervation and
continuance of the native's life. . ~
I
At the age of thirty-four years and ~three mqn~h~, the native is.again
attacked with a violent fco:r:ching fever,' which nearly abforbed r atl the
humours of his b<?ily, ·and annihilated the· blood and animal juices.
This was produced by a joint and moll remarkab~e oppofition of the
Sun and Jupiter to the afcendant; \vhereby Jupiter partakes of the con--
fuming heat and violence of the Sun,. b~ing. in. fextile afpetl w!th him,
in the fiery fign Aries, in the fixth houfe; .at the fame time that the Sun,
being in the airy fign Gen1ini, in the eighth, is tnoft apt to corrupt tne
blood, and to prornote putrefaB.ion. This fever continued with afionifil-
ing violence, until the Moon's crifis fu perfeded the force of the direB.ion,
and abated, by its nutritive and rpoillening quality, the confuming heat
of the preceding .configuration~ · . . · r ·
At the age of forty years .and ohe hundred twenty-feven days, the
Sun comes to a mundane quartile of the ponderous malefic planet Sa-
turn, which from natural defignation portends little lefs than inevitable
defiruB:ion, from fome fuddcn bruife or violent concuffion of the cir-
cumambient matter. Had 'this afpe& bee.n formed of Mars infiead of
Jupher, I fhould have prediaed danger of death from the fudden and
all-devouring firoke of lightning; but the quality of Saturn defcribes
it to be the effect of fotne .~io1ent blow, or fall from an eminence. And
th~ faa has real~y turned out~ that the native· tnofi improvidently at
thts age got- up lhto a tree, from \vhence he fell to the ground, and
broke feveral of his bones, and l~y for a confiderable, time \vithout the
Ieafi profpea or hope of recovery; but, as this malevolent afpeet was
not n1ade to the hyleg, it 'Na~ impoffible it fhould defiroy life, no

lively but Iu~~d nroqg \\'Oman ; ingenious, quick, and penetrating, but
pofitive, and leU: v;illed. 1'his marriage ~·as brought up by the mundane
fextile of the Sun and l\1oon, and may be ranked amongfl: the mediocrity
of the·happy ones.
.
The eighth houfe fhe·w·s us \Vhat might be expeCled from the \Vife's rub-
fiance, either fro1n do\vry or from legacy; and likewife \Vhat portion
of happiner~ and content may probably be found in cotnpany there\\'ith.
As t9 the firfl of thefe, \Ve tnay obferve that the Sun, in fo impeded a
pofition, rather deflroy~ the fortune of a wife than adds to it; and,
as to the fecond, there does not appear, either from earthy conncxions,
or from heavenly configurations, any reafon to form extenfive cxpeEta-
tions. The bcfi 'vay in all thefe cafes is wifely ~o learn to be content
'\Vith our lot. ...
The ninth houfe relates to profeffional fcience, to fea-voyages, and
the like. t\.nd, as the Moon is pouted therein, it fhev.rs the native, in
his ~arly day~, fhould have a firong i~cli~ation to go to fea, and to tra-
vel Into fore1gn parts ; but Saturn be1ng In oppofitton to the Moon, and
a fuperior planet, over-rules this difpofition; and !he\vs, by his pofition,
that, if the native had gone to fea, he \Vould have fuffered an uncommon
fhare of perils. and dangers, by fionny \veather, public enemies, and
fhip\vrcck. As to fcience, we have already feen the native's inclination
and propenfity towards it; and, confidering his fituation, and the difficul-
ties he had to encounter, he has made great proficiency therein, although
Saturn has often proved detrimental to him even in this purfuit, not..
\vithflanding the vigour of his mind, and the zeal of enthufiafm; for
Saturn, by en fling an oppofite malignant ray to the Moon, \\1
ho rules the
moifiure of the brain, proportionably dulls the underfianding, and caufes
the native to labour hard for every grain of kno,vledge he has the good
fortune to obtain. ·
The tenth houfe is the houfe of trade, honour, and profeffion.
In this portion of the horofcopc 've find ~fars, Jord of the afcendant,
beheld by the trine afpeEt. of \Tenus; but, as Venus is in her deLrirncn~,
lt
8o6 AN ILLUSTRATION
it is apparent {he cannot afford that eminent profperity _and unin1peded
fuccefs fue otherwife might do. It is however pretty obvtous that.the.na-
, tive's advancement: in life is not to be ranked amongG. the n1ofl: tnconfi. ·
derable; and that this fuccefs, in the department of phyfic and chetniftry,
!hould neither be difreputable nor. unprofitable. Mars pofited in the
mid-heaven, out of a1l hts e.ffential dignities, generally declares the native
- to be violently paffionate and rafi1 ; but here Vve find this hafl:y tern pera-
ture cooled by the mild trine of Venus, which meliorates the native's dif-
pofition, and induces him to be more gentle and kind.
'
' In the eleventh houfe we find the l}.nfortunate node of the Moon, com...
monly called the Dragon's' Tail, which implies hypocritical enemies and
perfidious friends. Of thefe I make no doubt but the native has had
an1ple experience; and therefore, from what had alreaqy come to pafs, I
would admonilh him of !he future ; being convinced, from 'this pofition
of his geniture, .that no part of his life 'vill be exen1pted fron1 the at-
t(:lcks o( thofe alfailants. This pofition of the malefic node Iike"vife de-
clares, that the native !hall fuffer great difappointments in his pecuniary
hopes and expeetations. · · . .
I
,The twelfth houfe relates to public ene1nies, .imprifoment, and great
cattle. Venus being a lady thereof, pofited in the fixth, in oppofition,
declares the native !hall be unfuccefsful in any dealings in cattle; at the
fc~me time it difcovers his prof~Ifed enemies to be in too abjea a fituation
to do'him n1uch injury. As to imprifonment, the~re does not appear t.o
be the leafl apptehenfions ofit; but that the native \Villlive in profperity
during the- remainder of his days, and yield up the· ghoR upon the bed
of liberty, full of years, and .ami.dft the good offices of nis friends, I am
bold to affirm, from the confideration of thofe celeftial intelligencers that
have never yet deceived me.

l-V'ithout even allo\\1
in0' hin1 to attain its rneridian altitude. In fhort1
this is a very rernarkable, at the frune time that it is ·a moft unfortvnate,
geniture.. tJpon the afcendant we .find the figr1 G~mini, and 1\tlercury
lord thereof, which lays the foundati?n o~ a.fharp w~t, and ~n acute ut.l-
derfiandino-. But then Mercury, hts pnnctpal' figntficator, Js pofited 111
the fixth houre, in his detriment, and in ~ combuftion of the Sun ; an in-
fallible argument of a wretche~ life and a fatal end.
This judgment is corroborated and confirmed in a 1nofi extraordinary
mariner, by th~ coalition of -
the Sun, Saturn, Venus, Mercury, and
the Part of Fortune, in the fixth'" houfe, which ·prefages every fpecies
of misfortune that can arife from poverty, and from the chicanery of
profrituted won1en; the i1nmediate effea ~f the baleful rays of Saturn
and Venus. This fatal conjunB:ion, to which Mars is approaching,
'\Vith aC~UtnUlated maJevo]ence, hath defignation or a thoufand difireffing
occurrences, which occafionally torment, and alternately pervade; the~
native's mind.
vVe Jike\vife find the Moon EOfited in the twelfth houfe, receding:
from a fextile \:vith Jupiter, and f<?nning an oppofition with rhe Sun ;
that is, departing from the early good and prolific temperature, to in-
creafe the viru]ence of the other malefic rays. The Moon is lady of the
fecond .houfe, and therefore in a more particular nJanner governs his fub-
fiance ; and, by'being, in the twelfth houfe, the houfe of imprifonment
and affiiB:ion, denotes a frequent want of prefent cafh,. and' the dangers.
to which the ·native would-- be often expofed on' that account; which
would have been dreadful indeed, and perhaps fecured the native for a·
length of time within ~e iron gates of a prifon, had not the more be-
nevolent planet Jupiter been in his exaltation in the fecond houfe, which
fortunate conliguration lelfens the foregoing baneful influences, and is
the ~eans of producing timely and unexpeCled relief, in pecuniary
matters, to the native, when nothing but the rnofi abjetl and barren
profpeas flood before him ; and but for which fortunate occurrence, he-
had certainly experienced the mofl: abjea penury and \vant. And here
it ~s remarkable, that whatever bleffing, or 'Nhatever abundance, fhould
be thro\vn in his way by the genial influence of Jupiter, is either
abufed, or improvidently fquandered away, under the oppofition of the
Sun and Moon; _
and, by the Moon's conjunaion with her unfortunate
node,. we are more ~Iearly conviEted that the notive.will experience very
cm.barx:aifed circumfiances. · .

The Part of Fortun(! unluckily falls in conjunElion \Vith Saturn anti
'lenus ; nnd, a~ Saturn is pofited in a fign out of all hi_c; dignities, and i~
the lord alfo of the eighth houfc, his influence is implicative of ccrtajn
ruin by rneans of vv-icked and debauched \VOtncn, defcribcd by \'cnu~,
conjoined to the 'vorfi rays of Saturn. "fhi.s conilruEltou is abundantly
confinncd by the conflitution of the hy1egiacal and anaretical places of
the f!Pure, and the difpofition of the fignificators by \Vhich they are
Iefpett~ivcly irradiated. 'I'hc afcenclant, in this horofcope, rnufi be
conf]dered as hyleg, or giver of life, fiucc neither the Sun, I\foon, nor
}lart of Fortune, lS fa pofited in the geniturc, as to entitle either of
thern to the pre-en1in~nce; and it is the peculiar quality of the afcend.
ant, occupied by Gemini, and aoverned by Mercury,· to ftamp upon th~
native fo early and. fa extraordinary a turn for. literary purfuit~; \\·hich
are too \fell efiabh!hed to need any. other proof, than that they \verc
comtnunicated to the intelleaual faculty by this confi.ruaion of the by.
leg and circumambient matter at the ~in1e of birth.
vVe are heTe likevv-ife to remark, that Saturn is the anareta, or de..
flroyer of life, and is pofited in the mofi noxious pofition that could
have happened, and where he ufually prenotes the £1tal commiffion of
Iuicidc, \Vithout fo much as one friendly ray to oppofe his influence, or
to render the !hocking attempt partial, or lefs defiruEl:ive than a caufe
that will !:ertainly touch life. On the contrary, here is a concatenation
of evil rays, 'vh1ch in a remarkable manner contribute to a premature
death. The Sun and Moon are in oppofition to houfes that are under
the influence of the \Vorfi caufes of death ; and as Venus is in conjunc-
tion ·with Saturn, \vho :rules thcfe evils, and dra"NS them' as it ,\·ere within
the focus of her O\Vn orb, it is evident that his death vlould come by his
own hand, undet:' the preffure of defpair, heightened by meagre ""ant,
through the perfidy of fome aban«;loned fetnale. .
If \Ve inquire minutely into the life of this unfortunate man, 'rc
{Jla1l find every aaion and prediEl:ion of the fiars, \Vhich were the irn-
preffors at his birth, fully and completely verified. He \Vas born of no

drudging for the bookfellers, 'vho neither having the generofity to re-
ward him C!S he deferved, nor fpirit to advance upon the credit of his
ff!H·ure produ·Clions, he at length, opprelfed with poverty and difeafe,
and overcome by defpair, put an end to his exifience, in the month of
A~gufi, 1770, by a dofe of poifon, which he prepared with his own
band. ·
If \\·e confider the quality of the direRion which produced his deatl1,
. \\"C fhall find the manner of it mofl aptly defcribed in hi' figure of birth.-
Saturn thus configurated with Venus, in that particular part of the hea-
vens, and under fuch noxious irradiations, hath at all times, as \veil by
Ptolemy as by every other refpeEtab]e profeffor of this fcience, been found
to occa'fion death by poifon; and fo many concurrent tell1tnonies in the
houfe of ftckne[~ and .--lifeafe bear the flriaefl: affinity thereto; and this
fatal direB:ion is rnuch firengthened by coming up with the revolu~ion .
of Saturn. - · ·

his Eterary attainments; but h~s fuccefs 'vas great, and had he been
born to great profperity~ and under the influence of milder fiars,. he
had been an ornament to the age in '\vhich he lived, and an honour to his

I am induced to give the foregoing horofcope a place in my \vork, as

whofe crimes expo!ed him to .the forfeiture of his liberty and life, by

This unfortunate man refided in Brifl:ol. He contraaed an intimacy
,vith a female, and lived with her in the clofell habits. of the fexes,
until they had ~everal .children. . At length ~ifagreements arofe, in
confequence of h1s refufing to marry her: and a vtolent quarrel fep~rated
them. 1_,he woman irnmediately ·attached herfelf to another tnan, to
whom fhe \\'as fhortly after married, totally forfaking ·her fo'rmer con-
nexion. The native, ·enraged at this circumfiance, took frequent op-
portuni~jes of w~y-1aying and remo~ fl:ra~ing with ~er; of ~~ai~ing a
· prior r1g~t to her perfon, an~ of tnfifbpg. on haytng fa~n.ha~uy and
contaCt wtth ·her, whenever he pleafed ·; but, fhe reJeCted han wtth con-
ternpt, and threatened profecution whenever he attempte~ to force her.
Hurt at this repulfe, and exafperatea at the. indifference·· with which
he '-vas treated, 'he took an opportunity of watching tl1e hufband fro1n
his bed, who, being a labouring 1nan, went early to his work; upon
which the native made his way into the ~oufe, went up !lairs, and
found the wife in bed. .Den1a'nding familiarity with her, he was refufed,
with fevere reflections on the methqd he had taken to get into her bed...
chrunber. He then drew his knife, and with a degree of inhuman
barbarity, better conc~ived than exptelfed, he t})rew himfelf upon the
.bed, and cut her throat from ear to ear.
<
,'The alarm vvas .foon given, and ,the c~y of innoce'!t blood becan1e
general. The culprit was· feized, examined, and committed to New-
gate for trial. He there affe&ed to fhew marks of infanity, and for fome
confiderahle time before the affizes 'vas generally believed to have per..
petrated the bloody aa in a paroxyfm of madnefs, which was now be-
come vifible in all his words and aClions. His friends availed· them-
felves. of this circumfiance to palliate his guilt, and took every flep to
improve the advantage againfl the ·day of trial, ~rhen it was generally
believed that he ~Nould be acquitted. Different parties,. how~ver, had
taken up the matter on different grounds; and it was at lafl: agr~ed, by
fome gentlemen of refpeClability in Brill:ol, that I fhould be requefied
to infpeB: liis nativity, and to give my judgrnent whether he '"-9ul~ .be
found guiity or acquitted. I readily accompanied the uentlemen to
Ne,vgate, and obtained the efiirnate time of the prifoner's
0
birth, \vhich
I reEtified by the method heretofore 1a1d do\vn, and found the fignifica-
tors of his nativity difpofed as in the foregoing horoftopical figure, which
I thus explained.
·. Mercury being lord of the afcendant, irradiated by a m·alefic quar-
tile afpea·of the planet Mars, and affliB:ed by ·an oppofition \vith Ju-
piter
OF A S ~r lt 0 L 0 G '\'.
pitcr, declares that the native 01all be involved in an abyf; of troulJ)e~
and aflliClions, even to the hazard of his life. Ac; to te1npcr and pro-
penf1ty of the w
·ill, he is rafh, violent, and arhitrnry; un!lablc in hi~
purfu1ts, and ufually difappointcd in his expectations. ·rhis is denoted
by the oppofition of jupiter to I\1ercury ; but the quartile of lvicrc;ury
,v·ith 1\tlnrs, particularly \vhen l\1ercury is conflitu tcd principal fignifi-
cator, hath tmplication of high cri1nes and n1ifdcrncanour:;, and urually
produces violent contention, a{faffination, n1urder, rapine, robbery, and
hlood01cd, as \\"e have more particularly delineated, in p. 2 29, 230.
Upon a further infpeElion of the figure, \•lC find a baneful quartile
afpea of Mars and Jupiter, with a 1nifchievous oppofition of Saturn
and lVIars. To the firfi of thefe \\'e arc to attribute the diffolute man..
ners of the native, fince ·it influenced the mind to thofe immoral habits,
\vhich eventally lead to pcrfidioufnef, and treachery, whilfi. the fecond
configuration not only confirms thefe vices, but fi1ews that they \viii be
the means of his death. Here is unque!l:ionably a favourable trine
of the Sun and Saturn ; but no great good can refult from it, becaufe
the Sun is lord of the t\velfth houfe, pofited in the tenth, out of all his
effential dignities ; at the fame t_ime that Saturn is lord of t.h~ fixth, lo-
cated theretn, and both the figntficators are under the domtnton of the
evil gnzii, vitiating the tnind and affeaions of the native, and tending
to an ignon1inious and premature end. -
At the tiine t11e unhappy native was prompted to con1mit this bar-
barous aa, the Moon came to an oppofition of Mars by direEl direaion,
\vhile !he occupied the cufp of the feventh houfe, which reprefents the
unfortunate woman; an'd the quartile of Jupiter lord of the fourth,
with Mercury lord of the afcendant, hath defignation of the native, and
points out the fatal connetlion betwixt the~,_
Having confidered fo much of the horofcope, it \\·as my next care to
afcertain the hylegiacal and anaretical fiars, and the particular ~influx
flo\\ ing from them. The Sun I find to be giver of life, pofitcd in the ·
tenth houfe, the houfe of juflice; l\1ercury, lord of the afcendant, be-
ing in Gemini, an airy fign, and the ~1oon like'~'ife in an airy fign,
fhcw the manner of the native's death, that he 'rould die fufpended in
the air, \Yhile the oppofition of four planets in the radix, and the mun..
dane quartile of the Sun and ~1ars, from the tenth, the houfe of juf-
rice, fhc'\1 the quality of it, namely, that it fhould be in due courfe of
Ja,v, by the hands of the common hangman, and not by fuicide.

· refpetlive pofitions in relation to each other, give no profpeB: \Vhatevcr

infanity, and the number.of per{ons \vho appeare~ anxious to ferve him,
yet all their endeavours \Vould prov¢ abortive, fince he would certainly
be found guilty, and fuffer the fentence of ,the Hnv in confequence.

It \vould be needlefs here to re]ate, how much this prediaion was
ridiculed by all degrees of peopl~ in Briftol ; or with \vhat contempt
my opinion \'r~as treated by moil of the poor man's friends. And it was
\Vith forne difficulty I could pafs '\vithout infult. I was detertnined,
bowever, to place my judgment in a tnore firiking point of view. The
allizes \vere not fixed, nor could any perfon undertake to fay 'vhen they
would be, much lefs afcertain the day of the native's trial. I therefore
brought up the dire&ion of death, with great nicety and precifion, and
found'he would be plunged into eternity, when the Sun came to the
anaretical point in the midheaven,-and met the noxious beams of the
Moon and .lVIars in oppofition, which, thus confiituted_, is ever produc-.
tive of a violent death. Thofe, 'vho will take the pains to equate ~his
direB:ion, will find . the content of its arch to be tw·enty-feven· ·degrees
thirty--four minutes, which, turned into time, and reckoned from the
hour of birth, 'vill be found to come up on the eighth day of April,
1785, and ~ives the fpace of life twenty-fix years; nine months, and
fotne odd days, which exaEtly anfwered to the native's age. I then
publicly declared, notwithfianding the popular clamour was fo much
againfi me, that.the prifoner would fuffer on the above day ; and, as the
allizes \\"ere not fixed, no one could, charge me with having drawn my
conclufions from the probable event of the day of trial.
~hen the folemn hour arrived, every one appeared anxioufly intereft-
ed 1n the event; and the utmofl: exertions vv-ere ufed to· fave the unfor-
tunate prifoner from the fate impendiog over him-but in vain! After
a long and indulgent trial, the jury pronounced him guilty, and he fuf-
fered the Ia,v, as thoufands can teftify,_ on the very day I had pre4iEl~d.
.

And here ~et ~e jufi r~mark, that this geniture ·not only points out,
by .the confi1tuuon of the Moon and Mercury in airy figns, that \he

8t8 AN ILEUSTRATION
This geniture befpeaks a female of a fharp wit, and lively d1fpofition.
Mars is lord of the afcendant, pofited in Virgo, the exaltation of Mer-
cury, but in no afpea ,vith any P.I~net:in ·the : heavens~ c?nfequently the
, fafhion and temperature of the native wlll be for.med .P~tnctpally o~ Mars;
· 'vho, as \Ve have feen before, produce~, 'vhen 111 .Vtrgo, a m1ddhng fia-
ture, inclining to brevity, ,hot and fiery temper, rafh and invincible in
all difputes, and ungovernablv violent in hafiy quarrels, yet foon ap-
peafed by good nature and fuh'miffion,~ ,which,. at all times induce her to -
be traCtable and induO:rious, and for the.,mofi. part fober and frugaL
Her features are defcribed to be th\n,and pale, occafioned by the Moon's
conjunB:ion \vith Venus; yet of a pleafing and agreeable vifage, owing
to the influx of the beams of Venus, 'vho is the author of beauty. But,
. by reafon that Venus is in her fall, ·t.he- fymmetry of-features 'V"ill be
proportionably deranged; and, as Saturn, the author of deformity, be-
holds both the Moon and Venus wiih·a fextile ray, it becomes evident
that the native could only be moderately handfome. The mixture of
thefe fignifica.tors gives her brown hair, and great volubility of fp~ech, ,.
from 'vhich great inconveniences arife, and fometitnes loffe~.· and _inju-
ries, as is particularly denoted by the reception of Mercury and Mars,
an~ the conj~nEl:ion of Saturn 'vith Mercury in ·the t\velfth, the houfe of
pr1vate enemtes. •
•
. -'"
This nativity might oe claifed amongll: thofe o(a mean and obfcure
defignation, fince we find no one planet through the whole horofcope
effentially _fortified, except Mercury and Mars, and th:at is only by re-
.. ception, which, from the confiitution of their places, declares good by
evil means, with a difpofition to lo'v and vulgar P.urfuits. And here
it may not be improper to remark, that, whenever we find the planets, '
in any nativity, out of al1 their eifeutial dignities, we might fafely con- _
elude, that their effe&c; will in no fhape be remarkable or extraordinary,
and that the native will lead generally a mean and obfcure life.
. . . '
That this perfon fuould live·to years of maturity, is abundantly evi...
dent from the c~nfiitution of her horofcope ; as 'veil as that fl;le would
enter into the marriage fiate. Venus and M~rcury, in this £g~re, gi~e ..
tt!llimony. to the hufband, who is defcribed by Jupiter, on twenty de..
grees of the afcendant, under the government of Saturn; fo that it
was very improbable, if not impoffible, that .:the .native would marry
youn~, becaufe Saturo is above the earth, copjoin~d with the fignifica-
tor ot her hufband, and declares fhe would uot enter into that !late at
leafi u_
nder thirty years. In fatl:, there is but one direaion within that
period, that could poffibly have brought it to pafs; and that came up

. Upon a further invefi.igation of the horofcope, \Ve fhall find that Mars
is not ~nly lord of the fl{cendant, but hath foJe dominion over the fifth
and t\velfth hou{es, which prefage th.o_fc; kind or fpecies of evils to the
native as are ufually produced in r thofe particular pofitions of.the hea-
vens. The t\velfth houfe being the houfe of affiiaion, and Mercury
and Mars in reception therein, it declares the native lhall prove in many
rcfpeB:s her own enemy; and, as Mercury is in conjuaion with Saturn,
who likewife communicates an influx of malefic rays to Venus and the
Moon, whereby they participate of his quality and , nature, in the fign
Scorpio, which rules the fecret parts, it evidently demonfirates gre~at
and Imminent danger to the native by child-bearing. And the Sun
being in the eleventh houfe, oppofed to the fifth, which is the houfe
of children, and being likewife the anarcta, or defiroyer of life, it evi..
dent1y proves the native's death fhall ar~fe fro.n1 child-birth;. an~ fo it
really happened; for foon after her dchvery of the fifth child, 1n the
thirty-ninth year of her age, lhe was fuddenly feized, and died in a fe""
hours, on the 13th of Augu!l:, 1787.
The dire&ion under 'vhich fhe died, is the 11oon, ,-.,·hich is aphtta,
or giver of life, to tile conjunaion of the Sun in the e]e,·enth houfe;
at '\vhich exaa time Venus can1e to the fame anaretical point, and !viars,
lord of the afcendant, to the t\~·elfth houfe, \vhere the malefic rays of
Saturn and ~1ercury contribute their baneful influence, all ,\·hich con-
fidered together, denote, in the moll remarkable and decifivt! tnanncr!'
a child-bed death to the native.

The fingularity of the charaaer and doarine of this.illufirious native

u defence and fupport." After refleaing on the foregoing paffage, I
was induced to comply witl;l your friendly advice, by briefl-y communi-
eating the following circumfiances of my life•
. .
I was born at Stockholm, in the year of our Lord 1689, Jan. 29.
My father's name Jefper Swedberg, \Vho was Bifhop of Wefirogothia,
and of celebrated t,;hara&er in his time. He was alfo a Member of
the Society for the propagation of the Gofpel, formed on the model of
that in England, and appointed prefident of the Swedifh churches in
Pennfylvania and London by King Charles XII. In tbe_
year 1710 I be-
gan my travels, firft into England, and after,vards into Holland, France,
· , and
0 F A 5 T R 0 L 0 G Y.
nnd Germany, nnd returned home in 17 t 4. In the year 1716, and af.
ter\vards, I frequently convcrfcd \vith Charles XII. ((ing of S\\~eden,
\\'ho \vas plcafed to befio\v on me a large fhare of his favour, and in that
year appointed n1c to the office of A{feflor in the Metallic College, in
\\·hich office I continued frotn that tin1c till the year 17,17, vrhen I
quitted the office, but fiill retain the fa1ary annexed to it as an appoint-
ment for life. The reafon of rny \\'ithdra,\-·ing from the bufinefs of
that Cinployment vv-as, that I tnight be more at liberty to apply myfclf
to that ne~.v funaion to '\'hich the Lord had called me. About this
time a place of higher dignity in the fiate 'vas offered me, \\'hich I de-
clined to. acceptJ lefl: it {hould prove a fnarc to 1ne. In 1719, I was
ennobled by Queen Ulrica Eleonora, and n~uned Swtd~nborg j from
\\·hich time I have taken my feat 'vith the Nobles of the Equefl:rian
Order, in the Triennial Affemblics of the States. I am a Fellow, by
invitation, of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockhohn, but have
never defired to be of any other community, as I belong to the Society
of Angels, in- which things fpiritual and heavenly-are the only fubjeB.s
of difcourfc and entertainment; 'vhereas in our litetary focieties the at-
tention is who11)' taken up with things relative to the body and this
,\..orld. In the year 1734 I publifhed the Regnu111 Minerale, at Leipfic,
in three volumes\ folio; and in 1738 I took a journey into Italy, and
fiaid a year at )Tenice and Rome.
With refpea to my family conneaions; I had four fifiers; one of
them \Vas married to Erick Benzelius, after,va~ds promoted to the Arch-
bifhopric of Upfal ; and thus I became related to the t\\"0 fucceeding
Archbifhops of that fee, both na~1ed Benzelius, and younger brothers
of the former. Another of my fillers was married to Lars BenzeHlierna,
\vho 'vas promoted to a provincial government ; but thefe are both dead;
ho,v·ever, two bifhops, \Vho are related to me, are fiiH living; one of
them is na~ed Filenius, Bifhop of Oil.rogothia, \vho no\v officiates as
Prefident of the Ecc]efiafiical Order in the General Aifernbly at Stock-
holm, in the room of the archbi{hop, ,vho is infirm; he marri~d the
daughter of my fifier; the other, who is named Benzelfiierna, Bifhop
of \V'efl:ermannia and Dalecarlia, is the fon of my fecond fi!ler; not to
mention others of n1y family \Vho are dignified. I converfe freely, and
an1 in friendihip, with all the bifhops of n1y country, \\·hich arc ten in
number, and alfo with the fixtecn fcnators, and the refi of the gran.
dces, who love ·and honour me, as kno,ving that I am in felfo,vfllip ,....ith
angels. 1'he king and queen themfclvcs, as alfo the three princes
their fans, fhew me all kind countenance ; and I ,~·as once invited to eat
'vith the king and queen at their table, (an honour granted only to the
No. 11. 9 ..S peers

peers of the realm,) at~d like,vife fince vvith the hereditJry prit~ce. All

fo kindly'-folicitous to provide.againft; and, fhould any thing of that kind
bef:1I me e1fe,rhere, it \•till ·give me no concern. , _
vVhatever of worldly honour and advantage may appear to b~ in the
thin<rs before-mentioned, I hold them as matters of l0w efiimation,
whe~ compared to the honour of- that facred office to ,vhich the Lord
himfelf hath called me, vvl1o was gracioufly pleafed to manifeft himfelf to
me, his unworthy fervant., in a perfonal appearance in the year 1743; to
open in me a fight of-the fpiritual '\Vorld, and to enable me to converfe
with fpirits and angels; and this privilege has been continued to rne
to this day. From that time I began to print and publifu various un..
known arcana, that have been ~ither feen by me, or revealed to me, con-
cerJ!ing heaven and hell; the fiate of men after death ; the true wor!hip
of God; the fpiritual fenfe of the Scriptures; and many other im..
portant truths tending to falvation and true wifdom: and that mankind
might receive benefit from thefe cotnmunications, was the only motive
·'\Vhich has induced me at different titnes to leave my home to vifit other
countries.. As to this world's. "Tealth, I have fufficient, and more I nei..
ther feek nor ,villi for.
Your letter has drawn the mention of thefe things frotn me, in cafe,
as you fay, they may be a means to prevent or remove any falfe judg-
ment or vlrong prejudices 'vith regard to tny perfonal circumfiances.-
Farewel; and I heartily wifu you profperity both in things fpiritual
and temporal,' of 'vhich I make no doubt, if fo be you go on to pray to
our Lord, and to fet him alw·ay~ before you.

Upon the horofcope of this eminent perfon there are four .planets

Upon the afccndant \\"C find fixteen d~grecs of the tropical fign Ca..
pricorn, '''ith Jupiter's benign afpca located therein. 1"'his denotes
rofy health, anc_l uninterrupted prof"perity to the native. It is the cm-
blcnJ of dignityj an infallible argnn1ent of ellccm, and a ground of
lafling reputation to the end of his days. And v~·c need no further evi-
dence than the forcgoinp- ''rell-authenticated narrative of his O\Vn life,
to convince us of the full completion of all that thefe fortunate beams
had promifed.
\Ve mufi not, ho,vever, forget to remark, that· as Jupiter hath his
fall in Capricorn, fo it denotes like,vife that the native fhall feel fome
occafional indignities from the oppofttion of perfons difcordant to his
O\Vll opinions and doarine, who, in the very midfl: of the honour and
favour he is receiving from eminent and royal perfonages, \vill infult
hirn \Vith perfonal refleCtions and poignant fatire. This, I have no
doubt, ,~·as a thoufand times verified, in a)mofi every fiagc of his llfc,
by thofe \vho con!idered Baron S\\·edenborg fuperior to themfelves,
either in favour or abilities, or 'vho fuppofed him touched \vith iufa-
.nity, among \vhich clafs there are n1ore to be numbered in this ifland
than in any other part of the globe.
The aftive planet l\1ercury \Ve find 1ike,v·ife in the afcendant, ap..
preaching his O\vn triplicity in the fign Aquarius. The influx of this
planet's beams, and the effea of their predominant mixture \Vith the
qualities of the other planets, in forming the intelleaual part of n1an,
has been already fufficicntly explained. In the prefent cafe~ it 1s evident~
that this pofition of ~1crcury gives to the native an acute ar.d penetrat-

gurated to gi":e an enlarged mind, nor ~he oth~r tignific~tors at the fame
titne fo happlly correfpondent therewtth, as tn the gentt~re no\v under
confideration. Ho'v far this ability has been efiabli~ed and confirmed
in ·the perfon of the native, let his attempts to pry Into the depths of
eternal Nature, and to fo]ve the vifions of the Deity, determine for him.
But," as there can be no eminent portion of good in this world, fince
the. fall, without fotne intermixture of evil; fo in this nativity, ·notwith-
flantling 'its eminent defignation, and the high and important benefits
promifed by it in the fcale of human acquirements, fiill v.~c fhall find a
certain portion of 111a1efic influence, of imperfeaion and misfortune,
· whereby the feeds of di{content and death are nourifhed up, until they
become predominant over all the po\vers and funaions of our nature. Of
this tendency is the baneful 'oppofition of Saturn and Mars; ~ n afpeB:
which operated 'vith uncommon firength and duration, both upon the
tnental and bodily funB:ions of the native, giving him the tnofi extra-
ordinary enthufiaHic flights of imagination, and expofing hitn to the
cenfure of the learned, as well as of the illiterate, who charged him ,vith
exorcifm and madnefs. But let me here en1brace the opportunity of
affuring thofe who have taken. up this idea, that there are not the
f1nallell: traces of infanity to be found in any part of this geniture. The
native· is perfeB:ly found, and fingular1y c:on1petent, in his underfiand...
ing; but, like the man who purfues the longttud~, or the p~ilofophet:'s
fione, beyond the beaten track of other adventurers·, and IS elated In
proportion to the new lights he ..receives, or the hopes he forms of fur-
palling every other competitor, precifely by the fame ratio '\viii the
world meafure his wits, and decide upon the competency of his under-
fianding and the foundnefs of his brain. · · · .
.
We have before feen, that the native's mind vvas by no means formed
for fociety; for the beginning of all our delires for community with
others muft be naturally founded in our love of intercourfe 'vith the
female fex. The native never knew a predileCtion of the kind, but felt
himfelf happieR in the uninterrupted contemplation of his own ideas;
and to fuch a pitch has he indulged himfelf in this particular, that he
has remained {hut up in his private chan1ber for two, three, and four,
days together, without admitting any perfon to make his bed, or even
to rap at his door. This uncom1non difpofition can only be accounted
for by the pofition of Saturn, fo remark~b1y elevated., at the fame time
that both the lu_minaries are under the earth, which gives a firong and
invariable propenfity to the native t'o lead a fingle folitary life.

To this gr:t\'C and fnlitary turn \ve are to attribute his early acquaint..
ance and [uniliarity \\rith fpirits. I·Ie has been often heard, in houfcs
\vhere he lodged during his abode in London, for \vholc nights togc..
ther, in convcrfation \\·ith thefe Jniffionary beings, \Vho become vifible
to thofc only that have rcfolution to devote the \\'hole of their titnc and
attention to a comnlunity \\·ith them. 1-lo\V far Baron s\\'CUcnborg has
benefited focicty and hin1fclf, by the intercourfc he has had \Ar'ith them,
let his fcvcrc-d publications, no\v in univcrl:'ll fale, determine for him.
The quellion is too delicate and abfirufc even for nn ajlrologer to dcciilc
up~n ; and it is a 111orfel 'vhich even the critic.r nibble at with unufual
precaution, Jefi they fhould be found biting at.afile..
It has been a fubjea of difpute, \vhether the fpirits, 'vith which
Swendenborg had familiarity, \V~re good or evil. For my own part, I
have no difficulty in deciding, from the confiitution of the planets in
his· geniture, tha~ he had community with both; \vhich I believe to
have been the cafe 'vith every pcrfon fince the days of Adam, ,vho has
had farniliarity \Vith fpirits. Indeed_, Sv~·edenborg himfelf tells us, that
a certain fpecies of the infernal fpirits \vould at times intrude themfelves
upon him; but that he was ahvays preferved, by tl1e goodncfs of the
Lord, fro1n thcfe infidi~us deceivers of meq ; whofc 1nalice and enmity
to,vatds us is fo great, that, w·ere it not for the \Vatchful care and pro-
tcaion afforded us by the clemency of God through the medium of the
good genii, or low·er order of the angelic hofi, it \VOuld be utterly im-
poffible for man to deliver himfelf from the po,ver · of he11, and the
craft of the devil. But I Ihall defer entering upon an elucidation' of
the fubjeCl:, until I come to treat of Spirits, in the tnagical part of this .
\VOrk, where Baron S\vedenborg's intercourfe "\Vith them \viii be COin-
pletely invefiigated. < •-i•
' .
I fl1all next confider the fignificators of the temper .and diipofitidh of
this native, to fhe\v ho\V far his general dcportn1ent -con(efponded ,.,·ith
them. As \Ve find Jupiter, Mercury, and the Sun, in his afcendant,
and the rY1oon at the farne time beholding that itnportant angle with
triangular rays, it is evident the temper and difpofition of the man mull:
be formed from a due mixture of their influxive qualities, each of
\vhich \VOU]d prove vifibly predominant,. as they alternately CalllC tO aCl
through the medium of their refpeEtive directions. Exa£Uy fo '"·c find
the native agitated and impreffed. 1\t one time his exterior \Vould be
uncommonly J?ious and devout, exhorting all Jnen, \Vho came \Vithin
the reach of hts voice, to hurnility, charity, and repentance. At ano..
ther time he \Vould totally feclude hin1fclf from all company, Ihut

hirrifelf up for \Vhole days together, and obferve fo. foletnn and profound
a filence, as not even to give an .anfwer 'vhen fpoken to.. Yet at other
times he would enter into converfation '\Vith the utmofl: vivacity ~and
fprightlinefs, and continue for a long t!me together in this comtnuni-
cative humour ; but always in afiyle and manner re.n1arkably elevated
and majefiic. .
The reafon of ali this is abundantly obvious .from the faee of his
horofcope. The fuperior. planets being pouted ip. his afcendant, in
their· full dignities; and.J confequently in their greatefr influence and
energy~ aB:ed upon the tempera~ure bc:>th of his mtnd and body, as they
refpetbvely came up by dtrea1on, wnh uncommon force and power,
,vJie·n.ce .t:he affeCtions Of his mind, his '\VOrds, his aaions, and every
~otion of his frame, were wound up to an uncommon degree, and
difiinguifhed themfelves accordingly. · ·
I f
It ,~~ill be readily .feen, by any perfons acquainted ·with his difpofition
and charatter, that the fame _
general turn of temper_and conduEt 'vas
uniformly f~pported througl1out · the whole of his life, which might'
fairly be ranked amongfi. tbofe of ·remarkable longevity. And it 1nay
be feen, by any perfon who will take the pains to equate the directions
of thofe fuperior afpe~s, that they operated, by alternate fucceffion, with
equ~l force and influen~e, until the direEtion of de'ath extirpated the
co-incidence of their beams.
The ~atural caufe of diffolution in the temperament and confl:itution
of Baron Swedenborg, was, as may be feen 'by the geniture, a decay of
l!ital heat, occafioned by a redundancy of c;old rheum, accompanied with
the bloody flux. The direaion under '\vhich he died, 'vas the Sun. to
a partjle conjunaion with the body ?f the Moon~ ta~en under t~e pole
of the Sun. The pole of the Sun IS fifty-one degrees;, the latitude of -
the Moon is one ·degree one minute north ; then, lJy taking the oblique
afcenfion of t}le Sun, and the oblique afcenfion of the Moon, the arch of
~ direction 'vill be fixed at eigh~y degrees feventeen minutes. .
. . ~
· If ·w·e equate this arch or track of the aphetical and anaretical fiars,
by the rules heretofore laid -dov;n, we fha!l find it gives the fpace of life
to be eighty-fix years and near two tnonths, at which time the -
native
emergesf from this 'vorld !nto a world of fpirits, ·namely, on the' 19th
day of March" 1772.

CONSIDERATION'S on the NA'fiVI'fiES of FOUR T\VINS,
\vhofc Gcniturcs arc difplaycd in the annexed PJatc.
Thefe four T,vins 'vcrc the produce of t\\·o births. The firfi birth
confificd of a 1nalc and a female, \\"'ho \\'ere brought into the \-Jorld
nearly together ; fron1 \vhich circuJnllance the reader \\rou]d naturally
infer, that the influx of·the fiars 1nufl have been the fantc on both of
thctn ; and, confequently, that the duration of life, \vith its incidents
and events, \Vcre infcparab]c from each other. This not being the
cafe,. ho,vever, I !hall proceed to account for it, upon the true princi-
ples and grounds of this fcicncc. And firfi. of
..fhe FE MALE
The child \vas born precifely at the time fpecified in the plate. Leo
afcends the oriental horizon, and confequently the Sun is lord of the
afcendant; bBt bein~ in the eighth houfe, the houfe of death, ·is an
infallible argument ot a fhort life. The Moot~ being in an aphetical
place, is the giver of life; but fhe,\rs the deflruaion of it, by forming
a quartile afpea with the Sun in the houfe of death. No fironger evi-
dence of an immediate death can 'vell be adduced : for, fince the Sun
is author of vital heat, and the rvioon of radical moiflure, and both of
them at once deprived, by 1nalefic·rays and cadent pofitions, frorn af.
fording a fit and due proportion of thofe nouri01ing qualities, it is im-
poffible that life fhould be longer fufiained · than dtiring the time this
unfortunate afpea '\Vas forming.
-
It might be contended, that the pofition of the benevolent planet Ju-
piter in the mediutn creli, or tenth houfe, is highly favourable to the
prefcrvation of the child.. But, when it is confidered that this planet
has no afpea \vith the luminaries, that its beams are· only refleaed into
itfelf, and that all con11nunications \Vith the afcendant and fignificators
of life and death are cut off, we fhall find that this eligible pofition of
the benign Jupiter is in the prefent cafe totally 'vithout the po,\·er of
conununicating the, leafi. aid to the funClions of life, or of n1itigating
or ]cJTening the lnalevolcnt effcEl:s of the anarctical influence.
.
A farther proof of this chilci>s di!folution arifes frotn the 1\1oon's
pofition in the tern1s of IVIars, at the fi1mc titnc that his fiery intenlpe-
rate beams are cqnjoined \\·ith the '''orfl irradiations of the cold planet
s,nurn, and thereby atl upon the conHitution "·ith violent oppofite ex-
tretncs.

tretnes. We find alfo tha~ both the Sun and Saturn are difpofed of by
Mars; · to whofe fuperiot influence Mercury bends, who, vvith the M·oont
nourifhes and proteB:s the brain. Hence it is· obvious that the child
fhould .die in its infant fiat~~ partly from the want ~f n~tural fiamina
and firength, and partly from· the effea? of~ cold fucceeded by a fe\:er ;
and' that this cold !hould be of the mo1ft ktnd app~ar~ frotn the trian-
gular rays .of Mercury and the Moon in the \Vatery .fign Pifces.. .The
child only lived until th~ quartile afpea of the Sun and l\1oon was·
completely Jormed,, -\vhen t~he 'veaknefs and debility of its body and
lungs gave way.. to the conyulfi.ve agitations·of the ,vhoop~ng cough, fuc-
ceeded by cold chills and fever, the immediate effeB:s of the confjgura-
~io~ of Sat~rn and Mars; ~o that nothing I.efs than a fupernatut:aLca~fe.,
wh1ch we JUfily call a mtracle, could poffibly have faved thts ch1ld's
life. I fhall next confider the· little offspring which accompanied it, .
and this 'vas
A M A L E T W I N. '
•'
This child came into the world only about t\VO hours after the former,
and yet it i~ not fubjea to the fame fate. The_Moon is prorogator in
this nativity, as well as in the other; but ' with t~i~· remarkable diffe-
rence,-. that both the luminaries ·are going from afpeEl:s of affliaion, in..
fiead of approacning ·to them. The Sun is entering into the feventh
houfe, promifing vnal heat and firength, while the Moon, juft [epa-
rated frorn a 11:oxious quartile, gives· teftimony to it, by affording due
proportion of health _
and no(lrifhment, being located in her Q\Vn houfe
In the fign Cancer. _
So that, confidering the nevv-ly:-acgui~~d firength of
the Moon, and the pofition of the Sun in a'fign of hts own exaltation,
emerging from quadrangular beams of ~ffiiaion,. we are affor~ed the mofl:
fa.tisfaC1ory evidence.of a fouQd and perfea confiitution in the tempera-
ture .of this native, 'vith fufficient tefiimonies to infure health and
longevity. •
I •
The varied pofitions of the other fignificators afford us additional rea-
fans, of a very firong and decifive nature, why this Twin fhould live
to years of maturity., while its little companion fhould fcarcely be per..
mitted to fee the light of this world. "fhe conceptional arrangement
def~ribes the fuperior firength of this child in the '\Vomb, and declares
it to have dray:n to itfelf a confiderable part of that nourifhtnent vvhich
fhould have fallen to the fhare of its fifier.
~ .
As therefore·the pofition of the luminaries in the other birth declared
a fhoft Jife, fo in this. they afford equal tefiimonies .of lo~gevity ; and

confequently the caufe ofdeath 'Nill be fought frorn different [peculation ;
for, .though the Moon be giver of life, the caufc of death will be daffc-
rent. In this nativity Saturn is the anarctical planet, and the nntivc
\Viii in all probability he carried into the other '~orld by the dropf}'.
He '\viii live until the Moon's body forms a n1undnne quartile afpect

Of T\VINS born imn1ediatcly together.
The genitures of thefe Twins are difplayed in the lo,~er part of the
fame plate. The one 'vas born on the 19th of June, 8h. 10m. P. M.
or afternoon, and the other nt only 8h. 42m. of the fame day. The
diflerence of time is therefore only tv;o minutes; \vhich admits of fo
little variation in the pofitions of the planets, and in the coincidence of
their beams, either in refpea to the angles of the figure, or' to the tem-
perature of the ambient matter, tl1at each Tw·iu mufl: of neceffity fl1are
the fame fate, in all the itnportant confiderations attending the iffues
of life and death. ·
To eftablifh this faa, ·w'e need only contemplate the l1orofcope, and
compare it 'vith the circumflances of the genitures \Ve have jufi dif-
miffed, '"hereby it \-vill be feen, that the difference of t\ro hours has
moll: effential1y varied the impreffions of the fignificators at the ti1ne of
birth in the fonner horofcopc ; . '~bile, in the prefent cafe, no fuch
difiinaion can be found; and confequently, the effeas of.the elementary
matter being the fatne, and the beams of the fiars falling in the fame
direai.on, and with equal force, .cannot affiia one infant \vithout the
other feeling the fc'ime affettiop; not .infi.antaneoufiy, but in a fpacc of
tinie precifely equal t0 that in \vhich the planetary l)dletn moves in t\r.o
minutes. This I ha.ve obferved in a variety of infiances; .and it is to
this very .remat;kablc circumfiance that the common· notion of 1nankind
relative to T\\"ins, that, whtn otu! i.J tnk(IJ ill and expires~ the othfr r.rNtlfo''J
follow, has obtained fo much confidence in every part of .the uni-
veife; though '"e have feen, in the foregoing gentturc, that this hap-

any confiderable time intervenes benvcen thc1r btrth, unlcfs the con.fb.

tution of the fiars ll1ould be fo configurated as to continue the fame
benefic or tnalcfic influence during the \Vhole of that fpace of tin1e ;
\vhic~ rarely happens, ov.ring to the.difference of veloc_ity in ea.ch re-
fpeaive planet, and the acctdental ctrcumflances of their becomtng re-
trograde or ftationary. #
.
To determine the fate .of thefe Twins, we have only to confider the
pofitions of the luminaries or.vith the afpeEls of the erratic ftars, and it
'viii be evident that their exifience can be but. of very fhort duration,
and is determined by the znotion of the ·prinzutn 1nobile; for, when Mars
catne t~ the oppofite point of the Moon, '\vhich in thefe genitures is
gi·ver of life, it is apparent they \Vould die. This was exaB.ly verified;
Mars came·to the firfi anaretical point in two hours, and to the fecond
in two hours and an half; and the chi1dren accordingly died vvithin
half an hour of each otht;r, and \Alithin two hours and an half of the
time of their birth.
But., to Ihew that life could not be prolonged in either of thefe infants,
v1e will take a further view o.f their genitures. The Moon, we find,
is in _
her:detriment,. difpofed of ~y t~e malignant planet Saturn, within
the rays of an oppofition of Jupiter and Mercury, who become fubfer...
vient thereby to the affliB:ion of that ponderous malefic. The Sun is
going down under the aHiiaion of Mars, difpofed of by Mercury, in
houfes c.adent and natura1ly evil; whereby every 'thing born under their·
influence is deprived of vital heat and nourifhment.. The Moon's
pofition, likewife, in the phafis of Mars an_
d terms of Mercury, much
firengthens this judgment ; befides, Mars is dignified in his O\Vn terms,
while the Sun is received in the terms of Mars, as well as of Jupiter·;
fo that four planets out of feven are in the dignities of his malefic influ-
ence, and partake of his ternperature. Thefe are all tefl:imonies of a
lliort life, and, falling fo immediately together, render the fpace of ·life
of a ftill lefs duration. ..._ . ; ,.

But, had it been poffible for thefe Twins to have out-lived the ele-
mentary influx of thefe defiru&ive configurations, fiill·they would have
died lliortly after. they had paffed their infancy, under the anaretical
affiiaion of the Sun direeted to the opp'ofitional rays of the Moon, who,
being giver of life, :would have had her vegetive ftrength and virtue
totally abforbed by h1m, whereby vital heat and animal pulfation muft
have totally fubfided. · . c

Ancl here ,,.c deduce a caufc rnoH obvious to the ft·nfcs, and flriEtlv
conforrnablc to the Jn,vs of nature, 'vhy the anaretical influence is fo•nc-
timcs baHlcd by the Cu perior firength of the native's conflitution, aHilled
by the rays of aphctic flars; '\'hereby the dife(ife or accident ic; baffled,
thou<rh death '''ere pronounced inevitable, both hy phyficianc; and
friends; lo that, \vhen the anarctic influence is thul\ ovcrcon1e, the pa-
tient acquires in11nediatc fircngth anrl fpirits, cats and flecp~, tlnd reco-
vers hi-; henlth and vigour in (o fi1rprifing a manner, d1at the phyfician
is cried up to the flues, as jinrjl man in the world, at the very rnornent
\\'hen he hirnfelf is as tnuch at a lofs to account for the caufc as the
mofi ignorant of his panegyrifis.
'
Thus it happens in many geniturcs, and it re.qqires the aid of reafon7
and philofophical acquirement~, to decide pofitiveJy· on the cffeas of
configurations which involve fo much doubt, and appear equa11y undc-
cifive in point of life or death,.' though obvious and certain a~ to the
violence of the difeafc or accident whe~eby the native {hall be afflit1ed.
. '
The furell \vay of forming our judgment in thefe cafes, is to direCl:
the afpeEls of the fl:ars ·which bear principal rule in the hylegiacal and
anaretical places of the horofcope, far beyond the rera of fuch undecifive
malignant influx, at Ieafi: till. another death-like configuration is formed
by thern ; and, if this appears the mofi firong and po,verfu) in favour of
the killing rays of the anareta, it will generally be found that abfolute
death will not happen to the _native until the fecond congre(~ of thefe
important fignificators is completed in the heavens, notwithtlanding the
danger threatened by them, in their firfi configuration, may make it ne~t
to a miracle that the native efcapes with his Jjfe.

oF the figure, at the fatnc titne that the lutuin.\ric:> arc fupcrior to all the
other planet~, \\?hofe regulating influcncl! in this nativity is totally v:ith-
heJd. ,
The Sun being in the t\ve1fth houfe, and in degrees increafing for..
tunc, fhe\\Ts that the native fhall thrive in the ,~·orld by the rarity of hi~
parts ; and fo it has in fotne ineafurc already happened, and \viii in a
much more eminent manner hereafter, as this youth increalcs in bulk
and fiaturc. He has now been fhe\v·n as a natural curiofity for fome
years, and a great deal of money has been accumulated by that rneans.
vVe have, in the introduaory part, already fhe'''n the radical caufe of
this fuper-abu ndance of nature in its formulary operation ; and in this
figure thofe rules are completely verified. For netther the fupcrior nor
inferior planets having dignities in the afccndant or tnedium creli, nor
afpea thcrc\\rith, and the principal light of time being in the twelfth
houfe, with the 1\1oon in the mid-heaven, and in the figns Gernini, Sagit-
tarius, or Pifccs, in azin1ene degrees, is a demonfirable proof that \\..hat is
then born {hall exceed the con1mon line of nature, and be either mon-
firoufly mifhapen, or above the comrnon bulk of mankind. In the pre-
fent cafe \Ve find both has happened, as "?ell in the exccfs of tnembers as
in the mufcular propo.rtion and altitude·.
According to the fame mixture and quality of the forn1ativc matter,
we find fimilar conceptions take place, \Vhenever Saturn aflliets the l\1oon
· in an angle poffeffed by beaft-1ike or double-bodied figns, ,\~ith the Sun's
fuperior beams increafed by figns of long afcenfion, and carried to the
fame point by fextilc or triangular rays. Under fuch a fynod of plane-
tary fignificators, gigrntic fiature, or inconceivable corpulency, is fure
to take place. Indeed I have been confidently inforn1ed, by a gentlen1an
,vho had for many years made Afirology his amufen1ei1t, that this w·as
nearly the poGtion of the heavens, in the gcnethliacal figure of the tnuch..

Again, whenever the afcendant, Sun, or Moon, at the time of con.

In this nativity Capricorn, a fign of brevity, afcends the horofcope~

earth, can afford no nourifhment. 1,his effea is produced through the

AN IL~UST~ RATION
Saturn. Mercury at bell gives but a fmall fiature; but, configurated
~·ith thef~ rays, _
he contrib.utes all his influence to check the gro"\vth and
nourifl1ment of whatever is c·onceived under it.
It is here likewife a mofl remarkable circumfiance, that Mars, from
a fign of brevity, beholds th~- Sun by a fextile ray, ·p~fited alfo in a fign
of brevity, fo that the figns .occupying the ·principal angles in this ge-
niture are precifely of an oppofite quality and influence with thofe in
the Ia!l: figure, and confequently have a tendency and effea diametrically
oppofite thereto. And fo indeed we find it; for this native,' infl:ead of
exceeding the common fize and fl:ature of man, will never grow' to the
height of four fee~, nor poffefs limbs or parts larger than· the cornmon
run of boys of feven years old. : ·
An additional tefiimony in favour of this opinion is the quartile af-
pea of Jupiter and the S1:1n from brevious figns, which ufua11y demon- ,
flrate the conception of a Dwarf. But jndeed it is an univerfal maxim
in this fcience, that \vhoeyer hath an earthy fign afcending the horizon
of his nativity, with t\\'o·or three planets p~fited therein, will certainly
be but of low fi.ature, par.ticularly if Saturn be located atnong them ;
for a cold and dry temperature, excluded from ,the heat and moifl~ure ·
of the two 1utninaries, is contrary to the natural growth of any thing,
as we may fee~ by the :Qate of vegetation in the autumnal equinox.

Thefe qualities. a~d te!llperatures c:f the plan~t~, demon.~rably {he·w,.
that the etnbryo In Its ortgin.al formation was void of 1l:an11na, and .that
the nouri!hment, during its continuance in its mother's wotnb, was
fcarce1y fufficient to fuftain life. It is evidently born without any
particular accident or indifpofition ; and yet it-is as plain that it cannot
long furvive ~he day ofits birth ;, and the reafon is, bec~ufe the digeftive
and expulfive faculties, the motion of the lungs, and the vibration of
the heart, have not fufficient firength or fl:a~ina to perform their re-
fpeaive funEtions ; and the rnome,nt the fiomach comes to be furcharged
with food beyond its digefiive power., the infant '\viii be feized .'~ith
fpafms, and.die almofl: irifl:antaneouQy, nearly ·in. the fame manner as
though it were fuffocated. · ·
..
I cafi this nativity foon after the child was born, and prepared the
mind of its mother to meet .its lofs·with refi8nation and fubn1iffion to
the will of God·and nature. The fpace of hfe will be feen, by taking
tbe diRance of' the Moon from that precife point in the heavens which
forms ~n opp6fition with Jupiter, lord of ~he houfe of death. This ·
gives, ~y the ·folflr motion, .abotit four days ; and the child died ex-
4aly iri the way I had defcribed, on the firfi: of Auguft following, which
is four days from its birth.

as a caution to every fingle perfon, not to enter into that holy flatc fron1

.
'The lady, 'vl1o is the fubjeet of the prefcnt quefiion, came to obtain
my opinion and advice how far the prefcnt marriage 'vould p ro\·c advan-
tageous and happy; confeffing, at the fatne time, that fhc had no great

the exa8: time of her 0\Vn nativity, and tO procure me~ if poffible, that
of the party to 'vhom !he was engaged. '"fhis \Vas cornplied \Vith, and
I dre'v- my judgment accordingly..
Upon comparing the radical confiitution of the t\\"O gcnitures, I could
not find a fingle configuration in the one that bore the Jeafl harmony or
fimiJitude \Vith the other. rfhe benefic fiarS in the angles of one figure
were oppofed by the 1naJefics in the angles of the other. The nu!lcuiJiJc
temperature \VUS flrongefi ·in the female horofcope, \\"ith the !V

Mercury in good afpecl in the fifth houfe; ,\·bile, in the n1an's geniture,

tifying teHimony of Saturn, lord of Lhe afcendant, in oppofition to 1\Iars,
the lord of the fifth, and the l\1oon affiiacd in a cadent hou{e.
The places of tnarriage in both figures \\·ere occupied 'rith the Jelfer
infortunes, ·but not difcordant; neither 'verc they harmon ized by a fin-
gle ray of benefic influence. I therefore f:1.\v the probability of n1arriJgc
taking place bet'\\~ixt them, at the fan1c tirnc that the V

and the lord of the fcventh an inferior oue of a contrarr nature, andy t
appl ring to the lord ofthe afcendnnt. Again, \\'C find rnarriages take
plctcc 'vhcrc there is no lo,·c at all, as is the cafe in the above figure,
\\·here Saturn, a fuperior nnd ponderous plnnet, lignificator of the n1an,
is pofitcd in hi~ own houfe; and the Moon, a bght und inferior one, and
fignificatr1x of the \Voman, likc,ri!c in her own hou{e, but both of thcn1
in oppofite figns, is a demonltrabJe proof of avarice on one fide, but of
love on neither.
Upon the \vhole, mutual convenience may be traced out as the pri-
mary incentive in both thcie parties. 'fhe rnan 'vas rich and old; the
girl young-qut not rich. So rvlars, being lord of the tenth houfe, and
pofited therein, collefJ:s the rays both of Saturn and the Moon; and.
being fo tnuch higher elevated, imprefles 'vith a Hronger influx this dif-
pofiuon upon their inclinat!o~s, and proves to us that their hands \vere
joined, but not their hearts.
Jupiter, in all cafes where be is free from n1alignant beams, hath
delignation of perfcCl honefiy. In this figure \\·e find him jufl entering
into·his O\Vn houfc, in platte trine to the Moon, and in fextile 'vith
Venus. But, although he thus favourably irradiates thefe tv~·o prolific
planets, fo as.toimpel a joint inclination to have the marriage ceremony
performed, yet, by being in~ quartile afpca to the Sun and Mercury in
the eleventh houfe, 'vhich is the bride's fifth, and confequently her houfe
of children, pleafure, and delight, it plainly demonUrates, that, though
fhe fhould have no offspring by her hufband, {he would take care to
acquire it by other means.
The Sun arid Mercury l1ave dignities in the feventh houfe, and confe-
quently have firong fyrnpathy 'vith the bride; but, being po(ited in the

Sun having his triplicity in the t\\'elflh, and being \Vithin five degrees
of the cufp, united at the fame time 'vith ~1ercury, fho\\:s that their

The extraordinary circumfl:ances of the cafe induced 1ne to give my
·opinion of the marrtage very freely, in the company I \V'as in, the fame
day it 'vas, if I may fo term it, confummated. Much mirth, of courfe,
refulted from my obfervations; but very fev; believed the circtnnfiances I
mentioned would fo fuddenly come to pafs; particularly that a feparation
would prove the confequence of a fingle night's embrace: and that both
parties would difuni'te \vith {o·much indifference.
The faB:s quickly followed the prediCl:ion. The new-married pair
were put to bed--
where love andjoyJhould take theirjill: but Iuch was the
fingularity of the cafe, that the bride rofe up \Vith the fun, and, hav-
ing been refufed that participation of fortune her friends had blazoned
out, and finding no other allurement to fupply that defea, 01e immedi-
ately d~ferted her hufband, who never took the pairis to retrieve her; and
fhe has fince attach.ed h'erfelf to two other perfons, by both of whom fhe
has had children. ·

Whoever contemplates the horofcope given ·in the annexed plate, \vill
eafily acount for this otherwife extraordinary narration. "fhey will
likewife perceive that we have given a lively contrafi of a bad marriage,
by an ernblematical reprefentation of a good one, where heart and hand,
and innocence and love, draw down the fofiering hand of heaven, with
fruitfulnefs and joy. Interefi: and ambition ought furely never to guide
the laws of love. The fweet intercourfe of the [exes, and the ecfiatic
blending of foul and body in the bonds of matrimony, becomes a crime,
when no~ di.reaed by tha~ heavenly flame. It is the attic fire of all-
powerful love, which alone teaches us to be happy here, and leads to
immortal happinefs hereafter; for, ·
We/1-chqfen love on earth can ne·ver die.

A LEX AN DE R the G REA '"f.--Born in Lat. 42°.
The perfon of this 1IIu0rious monarch is mofi aptJy defcribcd by the
refpcaive Iignificators of his geniture, in the annexed piate. \Ve find
the lord of the afccndant, and the t\YO luminaries, are in Cancer,
Virgo, and ]'aurus, all which are figns of brevity, and denote a lo\·t
or n1ean fiaturc; and, as Saturn, lord of the afcendant, is pofited in a
pitted degree of 1'aurus, 1t fhe\vs that he was 'vry-nccked, confiantly
holding his head on oae fide. He \Vas like\vife hafiy and choleric; \\'hich
is defcribed by the Moon in conjunaion '\'ith Mars, a configuration that
gave him at the fame tin1e an uncornmon fhare of courage, an intrcpicl
fpirit, and an unconquerable mind. Experience hath taught, ahat
Venus adorns and enriches that part of the body \\'hich is go\·erned by
the fign in \vhich fhe happens to be pofited at the hour of birth. In
this nativity, Venus is in nineteen degrees forty minutes of Leo, \\·hich
reprefents the back and heart : and, in conjunCtion of .Jupiter. 1"hcfc
circumfiances prove the native to have been endowed 'vith a large, bene-
volent, and courageoL1s, heart, all of \vhich, in the courfe of his life and
aE1ions, were in a thoufand infiances exemplified. Nor are thefe excel-
lent endowments prefigured only by the benefic irradiations of Jupiter
and Venus; they are further iJlufirated and Hrengthencd by the north
node of the Moon falling in the afceodant, \vhile Salurn, the difpofitor
thereof, is in trine to the Moon and Mars, and the Sun, in the exalta-
tion of Jupiter, in trine of them all.
The time of this monarch's inauguration and in\·eHiture of the king-
dom is prefigured by the trine of the midheaven v..·ith \'enus; at the fame
time that Venus is ·within orbs of a conjunaion \vith Jupiter, ,-.·ho is
lord of the tenth and eleventh houfes, 'vhich have defignation of the
cro,vn, kingdom, and people. . The direction of thefe afpecls came up
in about tw·enty-one years from the native's birth, at \'r'hich time his
coronation took place; when he, in every fenfe of the w·ord, began to
reign in the hearts of his people.
In this nativity, the moon is certainly Hyleg, nnd is therefore to be
direaed for death. 1.,hc Sun, Mars, and Mercury, arc co-figni-
ficators of death ; and, hence it is that the learned Gadbury attributed
his death to poifon, which misfortune befel him v,·hen the Moon came
to the quartile of Mercury in the eighth houfe. This prediClion of ~he

~ceffaries in the murder. · ..

This native is ufually denominated Bloody Nero; and indeed, if we
but cafi our·eye upon the horofcope of his birth, we fhall find ample de-
monfl:rations of a cruel and -vindiElive difpofition. Mars is oppofite to
·Jupit~r and Venus in the tvvelfth houfe, an afpea of noxious and dire-
f.ul tendenGy. Jupiter, .w·e find, is lord of the tenth, and con{equently
fignificator of the native~s mother. Mercury is lord of the afcendant, in
exact quartile of the Moon, vv-hich is an obvious proof that the n·ative
fhould cruelly treat and abufe his. mother ; and, as Mercury is at the
1ame time in fextile of Mars, it is a~ probable argument that he would ·
become a murderer. ' The quartile of the Sun and Saturn is a confi-
guration produaive of every vicious inclination, and of every atrocious
_
cri,-ne; Under the influence of this malignant direaion, which held
for a confiderable rength of time, he not only became hated by the peo-
ple u~der his government,. but exerci!ed thofe b~oody and unparalleled
cruelties .that darken and dtfgrace the annals of hts·reJgn.
In the black catalogue of his offences it is recorded, that he not only
rnu.rdered hls mother, but firft committed incefi upon her. H~ poifoned
his own brother ; killed his filler in law; and defiroyed his wife Poopea,
by kicking her to death when pregnant. l-Ie wantonly fet fire to
Rotne, and exultingly. made an entertainment in fight of the flames~
while the city was burning; and, being after\vards proclaimed by the
1-{oman fenate an enemy to the Hate, he, the moment he heard it, be-
catne his own executioner, and deflroyed himfelf in the thirty..fecond
year of his age; the direaions for \vhich are the Moon to the conjunc-
tion of ·Mars, and Jupiter to the oppofition of the Sun, who, in ~this
nativity, ;vas Hyleg, or giver of life. 'fhus the configurations pr:ecifely
d,efcribe the q~ullity of the man, and the direaions lliew the mapner of
his death, all which n1inutely ~arne to pars. ·

1~h~s nativity difplays a brilliant alfemblage of benignant ~o~fi­
gurauons, calculated to promote the moll exafted honour and fehc1ty.
To prefigure the native's future greatnefs, here is a mo!l ren1arkable
conjunaron of the Sun and Jupiter in the afcendant; and, to prove that
this fplendor fuall arife from ecclefiafiical preferment, \Ve perceive the
lord of the ninth houfe in conjunCtion 'vith the lord of the tenth,
alfo in the afcendant. That an extenfive flow ofwealth and riches fhall
accompany this preferment, is evident from the pofition of the lord of
the afcendant in the fecond houfe, firong in dignity, and in trine afpeCl
of the !vloon, which ·is in conjun.clion Wlth the Part of Fortune. rfhefe
are univerfally allo\ved to be the flrongell arguments of future profpc-
rity and grandeur to the native that can poffibly arife from anv Irradia-
tions of the !lars whatever; and the refult proved the certainty of the
faa. At the age of fixty-four he was eleCled Pope; at 'vhich time the
medium creli carne to the body of the Sun, .as may be feen ·by equating
the direction ; and is a n1oH apt configuration for producing princely
honou~ and fovereignty. The Sun, in this nativity, is Apl:eta, and the
~1oon 1s 1\nareta; fo that, \vhen the Sun and l\1oon carne. Into contaCt

.
In 1649,. when the native was nearly forty-four years old, he 'vas-
attacked by a fharp and violent fever, and his life \Vas deFpnircd of. This
indifpofition came by the configuration of the Moon, which is the aphe-
ta, or giver of life, dire&ed to the quartile of l\1ars : hut fatality \vas
prevented by the nourifhing beams of jupiter direCted at the (an1e tin1e
to the afcendant.
-
In the year 1656, a war broke out betwixt this Prince and Oliver
Cromwell, then Lord High Proteaor of England; an event which is
rnofi: aptly foretold by the body ofthe Sun corr1ing to the Bull's· Eye, a
violent fixed fiar; at the {arne .time that the l:>art of Fortune cornes by'
direcli.on to an oppofition of the Sun in violent figns•

geniture, exemplified in the foregoing plate, by the afcendant coming by
direaion to the fextile of Mercury, lord of the feventh houfe ; and tho
Moon to a perfea fextile of .the Sun.
In 1661, the afcendant came to the body ofJupiter; and was fucceed-
ed by a revolutional fextile of the Moon to her own radical place in the
geniture; at the' fame time that Venus forms a mundane trine with the
midh~aven.. Thefe direaions promife much happinefs, honour, and re-
putattonJ. to ~he native, and point out the happtefl and mofl illufirious
part of hts retgn.

The Moon it; this nativity being giver of Life, and the Sun anareta,
forefhows the ume and manner ofhts death. Let·the direaion of their
oppofite beams be equated by the rul~s already given, and it 'viii be
found that the perfeB:ton of the afpea tn the anaretical place of the ho..

HENR\r VI. I\JNG ·of ENGLAND.-Born in Lat. 51° 32'.
This prince fucceeded to the crov;n of his ancefiors \\·hen he ,.,·a~
but t\VO months old, and \vas cro\vncd 1\.ing of England on the 6th of
November, 1429; the tnidheaven being then dircBcd to a trine afpea
·of the Moon. At ten years of age he '''as cro\vned 1\:ing of France in
the city of I>aris, under the influence of the a{ccndnnt direClcd to the
body of the Moon, 'vhich configuration participates of the farnc nature
and quality \Vith the former, and they both mofl aptly denote thc:fc illuf-
trious events, ·w·hen applied to the perfons of princes of the blood, or
to heirs apparent lo the throne. ·
At twenty-four years of age, the afcendant ~s irradiated by the fe~:tile
rays of Jupiter; under "\Vhich dire&ion he tnarries ·with the celebrated
lady Margaret, daughter to the duke of Anjou, a princefs of tnafculine
refolution and courage, which is rel?refented by the fiery planet !vfar.s,
located in the feventh houfe, in lus exaltation. This violent and in-
trepid fpirit of Margaret was CJUite oppofite· to that of her confort, \Vho
.imbibed from nature a difpofition remarkably mild and meek, as is ob·
vioufly prefaged by the paHive qualities of the feveral fignificators in his
.genitureJ ~ifplayed in the (oregoing plate. .
In his thirty-ninth year, this native \Vas taken captive by the Earl of
March, and, by confent of the people, firipped of his royalties, and
rent prifoner to the tower. This untO\'lard event is prefag~d by the
Moon's qua~tilc application, firU to the midheaven, and then to a tnalcfic
quartile :of ~1ars, both \Vhich directions came up prccilely at the time
thefe circutn'Uances took place. After he had been l\,·elve )~ears a clofe
prifoner, namely' on the 21 n of !\1a)'' 14]2, being then fifty years of
.age, he wns inhun1anly murdered by the hand of Richard, rhe bloody
Duke of G1ouce!ler. Mars then catnc to the quartile of the :\'loon!
\Vhich, in this nativity, \\ras giver of life.
If we· confider the relative pofitions of the planets in this genitur~,
,._,.e {hall not ,,,onder that this prince \Vas unfortunate in '''ar, and un-
fuccefsful in all his enterprizes. The Moon in oppofition to ~lars,
Hrengthcned by angular places, and 1\1ars, fignificator -of public ene-
mies, fo pO\\·erfully located in his O\Vn houfe, at the f:~n1e tune that he
is conP,it utcd the go\'erning planet of the geniture, is an irrefragable
argument that Fate and the Stars \rere combined againfl this unfortu-
nate ·prince. The-caufe and rnanner of his captivity ate clearly pointed

1"'he lofty fpirit and arbitrary \Yill of this prince are demonflrably
proved~ by the·pofition of the luminaries. in· cardinal figns, as difplayed·
in the annexed plate. His temperature and inclinations are afcertained
by the conf1gurations of. Mercury in trine of the Moon, and in fextile
to Venus; at·the fame time that he beholds the aicendant 'vith a fextile
ray, and forms concordant familiarities \Vith the other fignificators~ .
This not only befpeaks a 'vinning and complacent deportment~ but
manifefis a.luxur.iancy in the gifts of nature, not commonly bellowed
upon the rnafculine conformation. Here are however ilrong marks of
obfiinate refentment, and obdurate revenge, even again{l .offending f~
males; \vhom if was not in his nature to forgive, when once feriouily
incenfed·againfl them, as the houfes and figns tefiify, wherein Venus
and Mereury are located. .
The afirologicaJ, caufe of this native's defire after. many. women is
deduced from the fexti1e irradiations of Venus and the Moon 'vith Mer-
cury, the Nioonf being at the fame time dignified in the feventh houfe.
And the rea!on of his continual difagreements and contentions with thetn,
is becaufe Jupiter, lord of the feventh, is in quartile '-vith Mars and
the afcendant, which fl:ir. up the choleric humour, unallayed by ]afci...
vioufnels and lufi. The feverity of his treatment to them~ is depiaed
by the huniriaries being in quartile to each other; the Moon in the
'\Vefi angle, in the houle·of Mars, while V.enus, the figpificatrix, of his .
concubines,. is in conjuntlion.with the Dragon's Tail.
The circumfiance of this_potentate changing his religion, and en..
couraging the refortnation of Luther and Calvin, is mofi admjrably
defcribed by the quadrate afpea o[Jupiter and Mars, 'vith I the Dragon's
'"fail in the nint.h houie. I lhall not go into a detail of this remarkable

This prince reigned over Great Brita.jn thirty.ninc years, and died on

It is remarkable of this native that he \Vas extraaed by manual ope-
ration from his mother's \Vomb, and his life preferved. At ten years
of age he fucceeded. to the crown of Great Britain, namely, on the 28th
of January, 1547; at which time the afcendant ·of his nativity came
by direClion to the conjunaion afpeEl: of the planet Venus, lady of the
tenth houfe or medium·creli, which is the houfe of dignity, honour, and
fupreme power.
This prince reignedonly fix years and five months, and expired \Vhen
ne was little more than !ixteen years old. The afcendant, in this ge-
niture, muH be taken for Hyleg, or giver· of life, becaufe neither the
·Sun, Moon, nor Part of Fortune, are in aphetical places. Saturn is
the Anareta, or defiroyer of life; and confequently, \\-~hen Saturn can1e
by direRion to the afcendant, the native expired.
To prove this to be a fatal direaion, '"·e find there \Vere operating at
the fame time, the Sun to the quartile of Mars, and the .Nloon to. the·
oppofition of the fame malefic planet; fo that both the lurninaries \vere
affiiCled when Saturn traverfed the afceodant, and gave frefh vigour to
the hand of Death. Hence it is apparent, that this native \Vas not de-·
figned by nature either for a long or happy life.

At thirty-t'V<? years of age he 'vas deputed, as the principal in com-
million, to feize the Spanifh fleet; and foon after he was created earl
.Jnarfhal by the queen. This latter honour begat hin1 abundaq~ce of
enemies, and created great jealoufies and fufpicions among the nobles,.
and particularly among thofe who 'vere inveHed with the feveral dig..
11ities and offices of Hate. At this time the native had the luminaries
direB:ed to the fextile of Venus; and, to fhew the envy and malevolence
of his enemies, he had the midheaven direEled to the oppofition of the
Sun. .
In the thirty-third yea~ of his ·age this native '\fas appointed to Ire~
IaHd, ·viz. on the 27th of March, 1599. 1~he Dragon's Tail \vas theq
on the arcendant; and, the day he fet off, the Sun and Saturn were in
oppofition from the tenth and·fourth houfes; and, what \vas worfe, the
medium-c~li came by direClion to an oppofition 'vith the Moon. It
is hence evident that he \Vould not profper ; and the event proved the
faB:; f6r, on the 28th of September following, he retur~ed to the court .
of London, the Sun being then in the place of Saturn at the time of
. his·fettin.g out. ·
On tl1e 2d of OEl:ober, 1599, he was committed to the Tower; and
in June follo,ving he was fufpended fro1n. all his employments and oH1ces
in the Hate. · On the tgth of February, t6oo, he was arraigned, tried,
and condemned, and on the 25th of the fame month, being Afi1-Wed-
nefday, at eight o'clock in the morning, he \Vas beheaded; at which time
the niidheaven came to a malefic oppofition '\Vith Mars.

·CHAlt.LES I. l(ING of ENGLAND.--Born in Lat. 56°.
This unfortunate monarch wns crow·ned king of this etnpire in the
t''lenty-fifth year of his age; and \Vas loon after married to the daughter
of Henry IV. of France. The medium-creli. was then direEl:ed to the
triangular rays of the 1\{oon, in the houfe of dignity.
..
In the t\venty-ninth year of his geniture he had the medium-cre]i di-
reaed to the oppofition of the Sun, under which influence he diffolved
his parliament. The Scotch enthufiaflic pl}renzy took place in his thirty-
eighth year, under the direclion of Saturn to a conjunaion of the Moon.
In 1041, being in the forty-firfl year of his age, he fummoned a new par-
liament, in '\vhich the famous contention about the militia took place.
It likev.rife fermented religious jealoufies, and lai~ the foundation of feri-
ous n1achinations agail)H. the king's life; all which mi~fortunes are prefi-
gured by, and happened under the influence of, the afcendant direEl:ed to
the quartile of Venus, lady of the tenth houfe; and of the Jnedtum..creli
direaed to the quarti_le rays of Jupiter. .
It was in the forty...fixth year of his genit_
ure, that this monarch p1ac-
ed his life in the hands of the Scotch army, expetting from them that
Jafety and proteaion they had proffered to give. But, when they had
effeaed their bargain with the parliament, the-y bafely furrendered hitn up,
in violation of all the ties of honour, humanity, and benevolence. This
tranfa.Ct.ion took place under. the.malevolent influence of Saturn tranfiting
the m1dheaven, a configuration In the world known to be the forerunner
of ingratitude, treachery, and deceit•
.
In his forty·eighth year, this unhappy monarch was behead~d, in
lhe front of his O\Vn palace, Whitehall. This rnemorable event was
effeEted under the direaion of the Part of-Fortune to the quartile of the

This native was a re1narkable favourite of King Charles the Firft;
and indeed, to a perfon verfed in .the aftral fcience, there can be no
\Vonder, fince there is fitch an aftonifiting fytnpathy in theit nativities;

an hnrtnony and fianilar coincidence of 1nattcr in the tetnperature and
cndo\vtncnts of thcfc t\vo natives, could not but produce that rcrnark-
ablc • concurrence of judgment, and fatniliarity of fcntiancnt, 1J'hich
'vas unifonnly difcovered in the a{t:ions and Jnauncrs of thcfc cntincnt
perions. .
This illufirious native 'vas not \\'ithout hi~ Ou1rc of pt·ivate encrnies,
'vho ufed every n1eans to alienate the king's good opinion and favour
from hint. But vain 'vas the atten1pt; for, "·here the heavens fonn
an unity of fcntitnent,. it is beyond the fubtlcty of human invention to
diffolvc it. '
In the year 1627, on the 27th of July, this native being then near
thir.ty-five years old, cn1barked for tl1c Iflc of Rhe. The fuccefs of
this undettakiug by no 1neans anf,vercd the expeCtations that had been
formed of it; and 'vhich 'vas before-hand but too evident; for, on the
very day he fet fail, lVfars was in exact quartile to his afcendant at birU~
and to the Sun'$ place a)fo; the Moon 'va.~ in quartile to the place of
Mars and Venus, and to the Sun, and in oppofition of Jupiter; all 'vhich
unfortunate pofitions previoufly declared the expedition to be as unfuc..
cefsful as it eventually proved.
.
. In the year 1628, ori the 23d ofAuguft, this native, being near thirty-
fix years old, 'vas bafely affaffinated and ftabbed at the Crown Inn, in
Portfinouth, by a ruffian of the name of Felton. The J\foon '\\·as
that day in quartile of the afcendant at birth, and the Sun in the radical
p-lace of 1\fars ; and, in the revolutional figure for that year., the :A-fooo
'vas in exaCt quartile of Mars and Jupiter. And befides this congrefs of
malefic traniits, 'vhich in themfelves \Verc alone fufficient to deftroy life,
there 'vas a'"fatal dire&ion operating at the fame time, of the afcendant
to the b.ody of Mars. rrhe grand argu1nent of a violent death in this
nativity, is the conjunction of the Sun and 1\fars, in quartile to the lord of

As to the n1anncrs, te1npcraturc, and confiitution, of this native, he
was n1clancholy ~1nd choleric, occafioncd by an earthy lign occupying his
afccudant, and Saturn's pofition being in an earthy fign alfo. 1·hc 1vloon
\Vith marti'!l fixed fiars of the fame nature in the afcendant, is a further
tef1imony of a choleric habit; but the grcaliefi proof of a fuperabundancc
of choler in the native's confiitution, is the Sun's reception tvith Mars
from ·vio1cnt•figns, 'vhich declares that choler· fhould overpo\ver the me~
laneholy humour, and become predominant. As to his unl!erfranding
and mental acquirements, Mercur.y, the patron of ingenuity, &c. is the
inoftJ potent, planet. in the. horofcope; ~nd, being pouted in Scorpio,
the hbufc1 of Mars, apdJfq ncar the invigorating 1 beams of. ''enus, is

As ·to matters of eftat~, he had the fixed fign Aquaries on the cufp ~f the

fame point, with the"fort~qa,te.nod~·o( the ~oon in the houfc of Jupiter;
all which are tefrim'onies ·of a competent fortune. yet, oppofed to this,
'\Ve find the lord .of the fccond '. ho1:1fe retrograde, upon the cufp of the

nus his difpofitrix combuft, in
quartile ·of Mars, and in quar.tile 'to the fecond, alfo; which are plain
detnonfirations of the lo(s of fl.lbfl'\n~e. and of.the decay of his paternal
patritnony. And . h~n~e we find .that Mars affiitli~g Mercury with the
Part of Fortune In an opfcure_·part of the _heavens, and the Sun lord
thereof in oppofition· to Saturn, influenced him .to fquand~r away his
eftate,. both carelefsly and · improvidently; even to the·fuocking extreinity

. As to the native's kindred and lhort journeys, 1\tiars is the principal
ftgnificator thereof; and ·his pofition in the eighth is the mofl: unfortunate
place in the ~vhole ·~eavens. He is li.ke\vife in quartile of four planets,
viz. the Sun, Venvs, Sa.turn, and Mercury; which is a further proof
of great unhappinefs·to the native from family difputes; and promifes no
great fuccefs in his thort and inland jourpeys. A'gain,' \ve find Aries upon
the cufp of the third houfe, and Mars pofited in a fieril lign, \Vhich
fuOl-VS a deficiency of brothers and fifiers, or no harmony With them, in·
cafe of any. It .wer~ n~edlefs to repeat the many misfortunes this na-
tive fufrai.ned ·on·acco.unt f)f his relations; ·or t.o recount the perils and
dangers he en~ou_ntered upon fom~ of his journeys·; it being fufficient
.to confi(m. the verity of this ar.~, by affirming that he never gained any ad-
vantage by either. ·
\Vith regard to his. parents; we find Saturn the general .fignificator
Qf f~thers, ~and Venus. the reprefcn.tative 9( mothers, are in oppo(tdon ;·_

ligns, \Vhich c1carJy fho\vs chat the parents of this native would d(e be-
fore he 'vas of ngc; but. hnd they lived till hb had come to years of ma-
turity, I do not fee ho\v he \vould hlvc been bettcr~d by them, .. lince
their fignificators are every \vay found fquaring and oppofing his. By
the account he hin1felf gives of his parents, they died 'vhile he \vas
young, and his mother's relations cheated hin1 out of a good part uf his
cfiate.
•
As to the fignificators of· v~·ife and children, 've have the Moon, lady
of the fevcnth houfc, in a double-bodied fign, which fccms to prcfnge
t\VO \Vives; but Venus, a general fignificafrix of 'vivcs, being combuft of
the Sun, in an evil nfpefr of the infortuncs, oppofes this influence fo pO\V-
crfully, that, did {he not cafi:.ri. prolific beam to the afccndant, nnd ~nbther
to the fcvcnth houfc, the native \vould fcarccly have ever married at all.
Under thcfe circumfiances '\VC deduce an argutncnt for one wife only, \Vhich
happened in courfc. · ' ·
.
Venus governing the fifth houfc in Scorpio, a frui~ful fign, irradi-
ating both the· afcendant and fcvcnth, promifes the native many chil-
dren. But Caput Medufre ·being upon the cufp of the fifth, and 'renus
combufl, in oppofition to Saturn, and in quartile of Mars, in the houfe
of denth, declares very fe\v, if any of them, thould live. It aftcr\\'ards
turned out, that the native had but one \vife, and by her he had fevcn chil-
dren, and they all died young, except a. daughter, \vho lived to years of
maturity.
The native's public and private enen1ies arc flgnified by the Moon
and Jupiter; but principally by Jupiter himfelf, becaufe he hath great
dignities in the twelfth and feventh houfes. Mars has aHo a fhare in
the defignation of his enemies, becaufe he is in trine of Jupiter, and in
fextile o( the !\1oon, and beholds the lord of the afcendant \Vith a quar..
tile ray. Now it is 'veil known that Mars reprefents phyficians, apo-
thecaries, &c. and Jupiter divines; and thofe t\VO defcriptions of men
\\'ere really found to be the greateft enemies of the native, both public
::and private : the faculty hated him for fin1plifying the art of medicine;
and the' church contemned him for his fuperior knowledge in the :t!lral
fcience. Yet neither of them.durfi venture to difpute \Vith him upon the
fin1plicity of the one, or the reality of the other, not\•;ithfianding he
gave fe\'cral public challenges to lx>th the colleges, to enter the li!ls \Vith
them. ..

AN ILLUS'rRATION
I
~ We iliaU no\v take noti~e .of the reprefentatives -of his friends; and
here, I am forry to fay, we have but few teflimonies in t~eir ~avour., Mars,
lord of the eleventh houfe; •being in·qtiartile to four planets, denotes ' that
. the na~ive•s friends, ~r at leaft·fuch as pretend to be fo, are. hypocritical and
. deceitfvl ; and · of fuch covetous difpofitions, that~ he "vould feldom be
~ bettered· by.~ them. lt is· \veil kn~wri the native often declared, that he
had a few,,)Vho callcd,then1felves ~is friend~, but that he W?S more pre-
judiced than ferved by them; for thar, w~en he ·mofr 1lood in need·of.
their.affiftanc~, and promifed himfelf the advantage of it, they generally
dec~ived him. · .. · ·

· With regard to honour and .preferments, .Origanus tells ·us, that the
S_
un ·in the tenth. houfe is a certain· prefage of honpur and preferment;
_ and that Venus, .when_pouted in the tenth, is a general figniticatriX of
ho~our by the means of \VOmen ; .and alfo, that the Moon in fextile of
Mars, · and ~he Sun in.reception with him, \vhen lie is lord of the tenth
houf~,. are evident proofs of future honour, fan1e, and renown• . And
indeed, had. not Saturn, \vho is lord of the afcendarit, been in oppofition
of' tl)e Spn, the· general fignificator~ of' hon'our, and"·in quartile of Mars,
th~ native.\yould .certainly have ·oqtained a far higher. degree ' of eminence
in life ~han .he really: did. But,·although he \vas·an·encmy t9 his 0\Vn pre-

'l'hc accidents or events Ly Vlhich this nativity is rectified ar.e thcfc. At
eighteen yeJrs old, he \Vent to the univcrfity: the Sun \vas then directed
to tl.e body of Mercury, and the a{cendant to the fcxtile of the fan1e pro-
tnittor. At t\vcnty-four years old, he particularly applied himfelf to the
fludy of phyfic : the !\1oon ~'yas then directed to the trine of Mercury, her
difpofitor, in the radical figure of birth. At the age of t\venty-fcven
years he \vent into the artny, nnd \vas \Vounded by a mufket-fhot in the
fore part of his body, of \Vhich he never recovered to the day of his death:..
at the time of this accident, the afcendant came to the quartile of the Sun,
and foqn after\vards to the quartile of Saturn, 'vhich prolonged and conti-
nued the malady. In the thirty-eighth year of his nge, he died : the af-
cendan't then came to the oppofition of Mars \Vith latitude. Upon exa-
mining and COOlparing the rcvolutional figure \Vith the radical horofcopc,
\Ve find the firitteft agreement bet\vixt them : Saturn pa!fes the radical
place of Mars, and re-occupies the afcendant; the Sun and Jupiter behold
each other '\vith a quartile ray; and Jupiter cotnes in oppo!ition to the
plflCC of Mars, ana in quartile to his 0\VO radical place like\Vifc: ,vhich
evil revolutions, agreeing \Vith malefic direCtions} nece!farily prefigure ap- .

At eighteen years and ten months old, the Sun came to the parallel of
Saturn in his nativity, by the rapt motion. .t'\t this time the native was af-
fiid:ed ·\\1-i~h a furfeit7 accompanied \Vith a violent intermittent fever.
In the year 1 651, '\vhen the native was t\venty-three years and three
months old, he v.ras married. This happened under the direction of the
Moon to the fexti]e of the Sun in mundo, by direct direction.
.
\Vhen the native was fifty-one years and eight months old, he \Vas im·
prifoncd. The direCtion that brought this up 'vas the mid-heaven to the
body of Saturn.

· At the age of fifty-nine years and ten months, the native \vas married the
fecond time. 'I,he direCtion producing this hymeneal contract \Vith the
mid-heaven to the triangular rays of Venus.
'Vhen the n:ttive was.fixty-two years and eight months old, he \vas in..
valved in great trouble, and fuffered confinement. This was brought to
pafs under t~e influence of the Sun directed to the parallel of Saturn in
the zodiac, by oblique afcenfion.
At the end of fcventy-feven years and three months from the dny of his
birth, viz. March 23, J 704, the native departed this life. The direc..

\Vhen this nativ~ \Vas bet\vecn nine and ten yenrs of age, he had the
fmall pox; at which time the Moon \Vas direCted to the Virgin's Spike,

In t~e mid~le of Augufi, 1 644, aged ten years and ten months, the na.-
tive \Vas affii~~d \Vith a violent fpo'ttcd fever and fore throat. This \vas
produ~eq b): the afcendant to the oppofition .of Ma~s: At fourteen years
of age he had a tertian ague. This \vas the afcen~ant to th~ quartile of
Saturn.

When fourteen years and fix mon~s. o1d; th~ n~tive entered into the
3rmy. 1"'his inclination is pointed out by the Sun to the quartile of Mars
in Scorpio. At fcventeen years old, .he had· a dangerous fall from a
horfe, and was likc\vife in danger of bei11g dro\vned. This .is defcribed
by the conjunction of the !\'loon and Mercury in the eightl~· houfe. In
September 1652. the native \Vas. fcttled in a regular line of bufincfs; and
then· the trine afpctt of Iv1ars came to the mid-heaven. In Apr~l 1654, the

On the 24th of April; t66o, the native 'vas n1arried· the :fecond titne,
under the·influence of the afcendant to the Dragon's Head; \vhich, being
a good 'benevolent diretl:ion,. produ~ed a good \Vife, and a happy marrie1ge.

\vhich are ·both tnafculine figns.

In the year I 66 3, the native pub1ifhed his Ciavis Elmata, under the di-
reCtion of the_Sun in the fextile of Mercury. ln May 't 672, he had a
f11ort but violent fever, \vhich feemed to threaten life. This was produced
by the afccndant to the oppofition of the Sun. Upon his recovery, he
greatly enlarged and improved his Ciavis Elmata; at \vhich time the .l\t1oon
came by direttion.to the mi,d-heaven.. In the ye~r I 673, the native ~rft

Upon the whole, .this nativity promifes much on th~ fcore of ingen~ity

hcavcn, is in his exaltation, in trine of the Sun, \vhich is a n1ofi illufirious
~~onfiguration . Befidcs, the Sun being in reception of Mars proves that
the n:ttivc lhnll be in high c!lc.~cn1 \Vith the public. Yet Saturn's 1nalefic
·pofi~ion in the tnitl-hcavcn nndl: needs reduce the happy effects of the fore-
going indulgent fiars, and give fomc caufc of vexation and dit:1ppointmcnt~
!:iaturn being tord of the h\·clfth, the houfc of private enemies and impri-

of honour nnd reputation; yet it pcvcrthclefs dcmonfirates that honour
fhall eYentually court him, and the rnalignity of his enemies be totally
bafHcd. ·
\
'The pofition of Mars in the fe\"enth houfc, in oppofition to the afccnd-
ant, renders the native obnoxious to a particular defcription of men; ·
\vhich is :tlfo confirmed by the Sun's plarjc quartile to the afcendant, and.
the Moon's. pofition in the fcvcnth houtc, in platic quartile to the mid-
heavt;:n and to Saturn. But, fincc Mars and the Sun both befriend the
native i~ a far n1ore po\verful degree than they affiict him, it is apparent
that all confcquent difputations \viH in the end turn out to tbe native·s ho-
nour and advantage.
.
It is here \Vorthy of remark, that this pofition of Mars in the feventh
houfc is to be found in the na-tivities of three eminent profe!fors of the
afiral fcience, \vho \vere all contemporaries in the lafi age, namely, John
Gadbury, '\Villiam Lilly, and this native, Henry Co1ey; nll of \vhom
had firong oppofitions to encounter 'vith their enemies; but they lived
to triumph over them, and to fee their extirpation from the land of the
living. '\ .

In the year t6oo, arid in the twentieth of his a-
ge, he \Vas created Mafter
of Arts, a thing at that time of day not very common in either of the Uni-
verfities;, it was therefore a greater demonfiration of his piety and.abilities,
and of the refpett·paid hin1 by the learned. . He_had then operating the
Sun direCted to the fextile of Venus, and to the midheaven alfo. In the
year l 612, aged thirty-two, ·he \vas promoted to the dignity of a Doctor
in Divinity ; a't which t_
ime he had the midheaven direCted to the fextile of
the Moon. In the year 16.24,,and in the forty-fourt~ year of his age, be.
was created Archbi!hop of .Arn1agh, and Lord Primate of Ireland ; though
lie was not ·put in poifeffion thereof till two years after. He had no~v the
Sun directed to the fextile rays of Jupiter upon the cufp of the elev·enth.
ho~fe, in ·the higheft digni"ties; and therefore moft admirably fignificant of
thefe honou~able preferments.
, Soon after this native \Vas created archbilhop, he was affiiCtcd with a yi-
olent fit of ftcknefs, which continued for nine months. The afcendant 'vas
...
then directed to the oppofition of the Sun, and the Sun to the quartile of
Mars, which direCtion, falling in Cancer and Pifces, denotes it to be of the.
putri~· kind, and of long continuance. In the year 1640, being fixty years-
of age, ·he came to Englan.d, under the imptilfive force of the midheaven
directed to the quartile of the Moon, and the Part of Fortune ~to the fextife
of Mars. He was requefied, in the_
year ·1647, by the benchers of Lin--
coln's Inn; to engage conftantly to preach before them, and they \Vould
allow him a confider';lble maintenance; it being then the time ofthe bilhops''

\•
\"ere l to enter minutely into a calculation of this nativity, the event
n1ight be prejudicial to many, and dra\v upon me the cont:mJ?t of fome
and the refentlnent of others. Therefore, fince it is my \Vl(h to give
offence to no party, nor to fiir up the embers of firife and diffenfion
amongfl: the different orders of iocicty, I fhall content rny!elf \\"ith
making only a fe\\' ren1arks,. \\'hereby the inquifitive reader 1nay be led
to a contemplation of thofc ccleflial influences, ,~,rhich llimulatc and
govern the actions and purfuits of men, and form the bafis of all fublu...
nary events.
Upon the oriental norizon of this iJlunrious gcniture, ,._.e find the
noble and princely fign Leo afcending, \Vith Caput Algol and the
benefic Jupiter moil gloriouHy elevated in the medium-crelt, the houfe
of kingly honbur, eminence, and unbounded fovereignty; \vhich arc
true emblems of that univerfal joy, of that glory, honour, and renown,
'vherewith his majefix moft defervedly afcended the Britifh throne. As
to the fignificators of temperature and 4ifpofition; no genitur~ in the
'vorld ever produced more evident proofs of that reElitude of principle,
ofthat benevolence of heart and mind, of that regard to juflice, mercy,
and truth, wh~ch affimilates the human nature to the divine image of
the Deity, and forms the interior of a patriot king. That the refult has
uniformhf ke{lt pace_ ,vith this defignatton, I arn lure no good man, nor
any lo:r.a fubJea, 'vtll deny. · ·
. .
The moll remarkable circum.fiance in this geniture is the congrefs for-
med in the eleventh houfe; \vhich it is my \\'ifh that every fcientific
reader would pay particular regard to; and I have no doubt but they
will readily make out, by the rules heretofore given, a pretty correcl
prefage of all the principal public occurrences that have happened during
the ·prefent reign. ~
'¥hoever turns to page 166 of this 'vork, \vill find it laid do,\·n as a
fundamental principle in the rules of this fcience, that~ by the conflitu-
tion of the eleventh houfe, that is, of the configuration !onncd therein,
we deduce all enquiries concerning friends and friendfi1ip, hope, trufl,
expeEtation, or defire; alfo \\'hatever relates to the fidelity or perfidiouf-
nels of friends; or to the counfellors, advifers, affociates, fa,·ouritcs,
flatterers, or fervants, of kings, princes, or men in po,\·cr. The co-fig-

The NATIVITY of our Bleffed LORD and SAVIOUR
JESUS CHRIST.
Upon this nativity I ·!hall not venture to give any opinion ofmy own,_ -
It was calculated above a century ago, by that.. learned and ingenious au-
thor, Dr. John Butler, chaplain to his grace James. duke. of (Jrnlond,.· ·
and rector of Litchborough, in the county and diocefe of Litchfield•.
He·publifhed it in an 8vo volume, \Vith a very learned and ing~nious in-
troduC1ion, fu pported by a fet of Chronological Tables, calculated to·
place the day and hour of our Saviour's bir~h at a certainty beyond dif...
pute; and, as that book has been many years out of print, aod is now ..
become very fc.arce and valuable, I have thought proper to copy that
part of. it ·which contains the immediate calculation of this nativity, in
the d()Etor's O\Vn words, without adding to. or diminifhing, fron1 the text,
or prefuming to introduce any ren1arks ofmy o\vn.
The geniture, or figure of birth, difplayed in tpe annexed plate, was
alfo projeEl:ed- by this learned' author, which I have caufed to be carefully
engraved from a correBed copy in the doaor's O\Vn hand; and 1 flatter ·
myfelf, that the reputation which this traa has acquired in every part of
Europe" added to the refpetlability and eminence of its author, \Vlll not
fail to render it higqly acceptable to the read.er. The following extraCt
commences with page 256 of the doctor's book. ·

AN ILLUSTRATION

over t'Venty-nine complete years, he was baptized, and entered into his
miniHry; and at the lame time he was forty-d~ys tempted·of the devil;
and at the end of thole was very contemptuoufly caH out of Nazareth by
the rude rabble ~here. Y.et, notvvithHandiog, he was very V\·eJl received
at Capernautn; and at Jerufaiem he drove the buyers and fellers out ofthe
temple. · And lafily, ·after three years and three ~npn.rhs fpent in l~is mi-
niftty, at thirty-two years of age and one hundred and one days over, he
was crucified upon Mount Calvary, bet\veen .t\\7
0 thie'··es, and died upon
the crofs. But, although he lived unto tha.t t1rne, yet it was about fix
tnonths fooner, at·what time the Jews ~onfpired againft h'inl to kill him at
the feaft ·
of tabernacles; and about t\vo' months before the time he was
condemned by the Sanhedrim, and a proclan1ation was·iffued out to take ...
-him. Now may we find a time, .according to the· experienced ~ules of ...
a~t, to fuit fitly with all thefe accide'nts, and fuch a time as fi1all aptly -
defcribe him t~ be the man that in Holy Writ he is fet forth to be. 1 'hen
fay I, it.is a.certain argument that both the day, hour, and minute, of
Chrifi's birth are demonfirativ·ely determined. And fo will all acknow-

Now, as Chrifi had a real body 1nade of a \VOlnan, fo 'vas it no frnall
' argurneut of the reality of his body, in t~at it fubn1itted unto the im-
preHion~ of the Hars, as do thofe ofother n1en. For, although the in1--
n1rafurable 'po\ver of the fpirit upon him \Vas able to [,vay, and did f'v\1'ay,
all irnpreHions and'inclinations of nature, fo as to fubjea theJn abfolutefy
to be obedient in all things unto the co~mand of his holy \Vill; yet
\Vere not. only the con1plcxion of his qoay, but alfo the qualities of
his n1ind and afleElions, much of theJft preffed and wrought by the ..
po'Ner of the heavens. Only excepted, that, whereas he was born v.:ith-
cut fin, neither evil planets, nor evil afpet1s of any planet, could have
that ad\'antage to work upon his manners and difpofitton, fo as to incline
them '\Vith fuch command as they do by 'other&. But, as for the acci
dents of his life, in refpea of 'vhat bele1 him, as for matter of love or
hatred, ficknefs and health, life and d~ath, the fiars had as free and full
liberty and po\ver over hitn and his body as upon any the leaft of us.
For, though he \Vas able, by fpecial authority of his own, to force the
utmoll po'"'·cr of fiars; or heaven, yet herein l~y his humility, and his
charity in that hun1ility, in that he voluntarily fubmitted his body to be
ordered according to the cou~re of nature: whereas, 'vould he himielf,
he xnight have made it lord over all that nature could do. And, though
he raifed the bodies of others .from death unt'o life, in defpite of nature,
yet 'vould he fuffer his own body quietly to be ordered even as nature
would herfelf. ·
Thefe things confidered, next come we to meafure the time between·
the accidents of life and time of birth. It is obferved, and a continued:
experience ·has verified it according to obfervation, that, (unlefs fomc
fj)ecial interruption inteTvene, either by a tranut, or fon1e revolution ut.. .
terly croffing,) from the fign1ficator in a nativity unto the promittor of
the thing fign1fied, there are ordinarily fo many times one year and five
days and eight hours as there are degrees either of afcenfion' or defcen-
fion between the one and the other. .'fhe moft. ren1arkable accident of
Chrift's life, that \Ve can vvork by, \vas his dea~h, and the manner of it
· at the end of thirty·two years and an hundred and one days after birth.
'I'o bring lhis about, the. l\1oon claims nothing as a fignificator; The
s~tn feetns to proffer fomething, as if his direCtion to the quartile of the
l\loon fhould proclaim fame filch matter. But then the Sun, being.
neither giver of life, nor years, in this notlurnal geniture, could hardly
have fuHered fo fatally by that quartile, that death fhould follo'v upon
it. And ber1des, upon exan1ination it appears, that the direElion came
up fon1e·years too !oon for thirty-tV\:·o,. in ~hat pofition foever placed
under ground. And no\r then.~fore, tf neither Sun nor Moon were

the perfon, and the othet· acciuents of his life, but that of the a!ccndant
to the conjunc1ion of the ~1oon. .,T'he 1\'loon at midnight of tbc fore-·

and minute to be t\\'O hundred and t\vcl ve degree.c; and fifty minutes:
but, if \VC confider her la'titude, the oblique defcenfion ,yjl) pro\'e two

when the afceridant fell under this direful direElion, 're 1nufl allov.~ for:1e
time for the firength of conflitution, 'vhich this fchcnH·, pofited alter

' l1irn, ar~,d they fou ght to take him, but he efcaped, and \Vent a'vay be-

him; out this aCl had nothing of the Hars in it. Then, that the fhep-
herds came and publifhed his glory all over the city, and in thirteen days
after came the wife men from the eafi to \V"orfhip him ; all thefe were
nothing elfe but the fruit of famous tranfits at ,the time of birth : the
Virgin's Spike and·ArClurus (t\V'O great and noble fiars) ·were ne,vly gone
by, and, being within orbs, dre\v after them a goodly race of honour
and glory; Jupiter who accidentally reprefented fhepherds, as he ,..Ta.

lo~d of th~ fi~th houfe, and naturally fignified religious perfons, or royal
pnefis, be1ng 1n the afcendant, and near upon the curp, \Vas much about
rifing, _\Vhen the fhepherds entered, and drew the priefily kings out of
the eaft to vifit him; the Sun, alfo a fignificator of honour, v•as in con·
juntlion of Venus, who had dignity in the ninth, and. \Vith the Flying
Vulture, a royal fiar, and the famou·s Fomahaut,- by latitude, was
\vithin ·his beams, with thefe tranfits accompanying thefe honourable
direttions. Firft the mid-heaven was nearly coming up to the oppofi-
tion of the Sun, and the afcendant was haUening after to the quartile of

But that \\'"hich came nearefi to the purpofe, \vas the 1'Ioon to the con·
junClion of Algol's Head, at the end of t'h'elve days and odd hours, at the
very point of time as the \vife men came. Now· this .A.lgol's Head is a
fiar of Saturn and Mercury, and, though it be a mifchievous fiar, yet
it fignifies preferment, though it be witl1 a vengeance at the heels of it.
And fo it was here. For, the \vife men being ·gone, Herod, by tneans
-of their con1ing, plotted ChriH's murder, ~n~l forced him to flight.
1'he mid-heaven alfo to the oppolition, and the afcendant to the
'qUartile, of the Sun, aEted much {uch another part as Algol's Head did, .
,giving .hon?ur of kings, though not 'vithout a 1nifchief in it. But. ~he
Moon 1n tnne of the ~un .~nd 1\!Iercury, argued a~ aptilefs ?f the nat_tve

And this needed no more anger than from what direClions gave the pre..
ceding honour, as the Moon to Algol's Head, at thirteen days of age;
for .here Herod plotted his murder; and the mid-heaven to the oppofi-
tion of the Sun at an hundred an'd eighty-five days end; and the afcen-
dant to the quartile of the Sun at two hundred and two days end;. and .
to Mercury at three hundred and fifty-two days end; for all this while
wa~ our Lord and blelfed ,~aviou r a Hranger in a firange land, and an
exile who durfl not fhew his head, neither durH his parents be known,
who, or ,vhat~ or where, he \·vas. The Sun to Mercury as lord of the
twelfth houfe', fignifies a milchief by means of private enemies; a[ld yet_,.
.as Mercury was aHb lord of t~e ninth, it helped out of that mifchief, by
.means of a long jo~rriey: ·with thefe alfo accompanied the Part of For-
tune to a quartile ofthe Moon at two hundred and ninety-three days end;
and· the mid.heaven to the oppofition of Mercury at one year's end and
one hundred feventy-two days: and laftly, the afcendant to the quar-

(for fo long cQntinued our Saviour's exile in Egypt.) But when the
Moon entered into terms of Venus in Taurus o o, at two years of age

Jupiter to the North Balance 'vith latitude: ..and at three years. and
thirty..'five days came Jupiter into his own terms: 'and a_
t four years and

clfe very great wrongs from his cncn1ics. But Horn1s Jafl not for ever:
the afccndant came to Jupiter, at eight years and one hundred and fixty-
fix daxs, and gave him a very halcion time; and he then lived in much
Jove ofneighbours and kindred. At ten years and one l~undred and fiftr-
t\\'O days, l1e fecms to have encountered Iome more nnsfortunes, or cHe
his mother bore them for him, by means of the Moon falling into the
pit called the Dragon's 'fail. But within three n1onths after, Jupiter
con1ing to the trine of Venus gave him great content, \vhether it \Vas by
tneans of fome long journey, or by reafon of the pleafure of his lludies,
or both: however, it was a pleafant time, and the \Vorld feetned to \\'cl-
come him \vith fome of her favours.
.
But, at the end of t\\'elve years and fome three months over, he began
to be taken notice of publicly for his great 'vifdom and parts. Venus
was lady of his afcendant, and alfo pnncipal fignificatrix of his mind.
And, at twelve years of age and fifty-t,vo days over, fhe carne, by di-
reaion, to a fextile of the l\ioon's difpofitrefs of his honour and ad-
vancement; which is as much as to fay, ll1e brought hitn to be v.·ell
accepted for his inward '\Vorth, and excellency of mind, amongfl: men
of power and authority. And the virtue of this good direElion
wrought to purpofe at the paffover after, at the latter end of ~1arch,
about fome forty-one days after the direaion happened. But, from this
time forward there is no quefiion but he was every year more and more no-
ted and admired, ·as he came yearly up to the feafi at Jerufalem; for at
t\velve years and one hundred and nineteen days, ~..hich \vas but a month
after the paffover, the Part of Fortune came to a trine of Jupiter 'vith
latitude, and about feventy-four days after to the fame trine ''tithout
latitude; and at one hundred and fixty-nine days over t\velve year~
carne up the afcendant to a trine of Saturn out of the ninth houfe, \\"ith
lat~tude, and eighteen days·after that to the fame trine '\Vithout latitude;
apd thefe are direEtions to credit a man, amongfl: ·ancient and ferious
people, to purpofe. . But that 'vhich hit neareU upon the very \veek,
was the direaion of the ninth houfe unto the trine of Jupiter 'vith
latitude, which ha-
ppened _at !he end of t\velve years and one h~ndred
and one days, at the begtr.ntng of April, prefently after the paffover
\Veek; and the fame houfe came to the fame trine \Yithout latitude about
forty days after. But, however, the direaio'ns preceding and fucceeding
all concurred to heap UE the glory of his difputation amongfi the doaors.
Alfo thefe kind of directipns made him dexterous at his calling too, in
building houfes, and following his bufinefs ferioufiy, and '\VJth great

·year after, the Moon to the contra-a'ntifcion of Ve:Qus was ilr either to
himfelf or.his mother, or both; And at over feventeen, the Sun fell
;under the ·contra-antifcions of Sat!Jrnt and that feems to have been
grievous to his reputed father. At fixteen years and ninety-eight days,
the ninth houfe came up to the body of Saturn; and then ·no·doubt but
he was luHiciently unhappy in his grave counfels, and ·met with n1ore
derifion than attention.. And they, who formerly had applauded his wi£:..
.-dam, would be apt enough now to betray their own weaknefs, in chan-
ging t~eir Hory. -- Yet Venus coming to the fextile of t~e Suh a little
.after, 1n the fame year, ~ would not only allay much of that difpa-
ragement, but alfo would be raifing friends amongll the more prudent
fort of po,verful perfons, to reprove and bridle the licentious lips of en-
vious·and upbraiding tongues. At eighteen years and three hunored and
fixty-one days the afcendant happened upon the trine of Venus, and
that 'vas an healthful and a pleafant time, cleaving off the reproaches of
Saturn and envious people. At twenty-two entering, the Part of For·
tune fell into the lap of Venus in the fifth houfe, and rendered a time
religioufly pleafant. And at twenty-two years and one hundred and
thirty-fix days, the ninth houfe got.out of the clutches of envious Saturn,
.and encountered a trine of Venus, in the fign Gemini-: And this un-
doubtedly·gave hitn to fee favoury fruits of his good counfels and grave
admonition, to his great contentment. But towards the year ending,
the rvioon coming to the quartile of Venus interrupted the pleafant pro-
grefs·of his affairs: And, ·in the twenty-third year well entered, he met
with great oppofition, as well fron1 men jn .power as the rabble-rout,
greatly ga1nfaying his facred conv~rfation, and this by means of Jupiter
fall~ng under the Moon's oppofition, both without and \vith latitude,

fell upotJ the ,q uartile·of Saturn; and this adminiH~red unto him much

John the Baptifl entering into his minillrr. Jefus feems greatly to have
been an·rontcd by people of all forts. It is vcrv likely too, th:~t old J ofeph,

nifies parents. And \vhether it "·as \vhen Saturn cJnlc to the oppo!ition
of the Sun, or no\v that the Sun can1e to the quartile of the Moon, \Ye
cannot certainly detern1ine; but n1uch about this time it feems he h:ft
this \v·orld for a better.
But no\v the time dnl\VS on, ''rherein Jefus began to fhe\v himfelf the
ChriH; at this time he \Vas baptized of John in Jordan. Ifis Jdngdom
\Vas not of this \Vorld, neither 1Nas his miniflry of men, or· by n1an's
authority, but by a divine commiffion; and by figns and wonders it was
confirmed to be fo. We cannot therefore expeCl influence from heaveo
for thofe things which corne from beyond heaven; nor mufi \Ve expea
a cotnrniffion froln the flars for thofe miracles he aaed as it 'vere in
defiance of them. And, as for \rhat applaufe foJlo,ved -by virtue of thofe
miracles, \ve mufl Jook for the rea!on of it from the Maker ofall things,
rather than from any created being, though never fo much exceeding
all other creatures.. Yct, for fuch natural paiTages as amongCl: his rni- ·
racles did accrue, v/e cannot debar nature from executing her office Hill.
And firfl:, \fe find him thru!l: out contemptuoufly and rudely at Nazareth,
_ \vith great fcorn unto his facred funchon; infon1uch that he removed
his houfehold upoh it unto Capernaum. And in this great affront his
n1other alfo feemed nota littleconcerned, who removed her houfehold with
him, from \Vhere fhe feems to have been bred and born, unto a Hrange
place. Now at this time the mid-heaven, the fignificator of Chritl•s
honour and his mother's perfon, came to quartile of the Moon, \\'hich
very fitly fuits with all that happened. The direClion came up on the
fixth of November, before the t'venty-eighth year \vas quite run out.

funaion, came to a trine of Mercury, lord of the ninth. This happened
at twenty-five days over t\\"enty-nine years of age, much about the
time of his entrance into his miniUry. And, though we cannot fay

hundred and twenty-two days, about the beginning of Augufl; at which
time his neighbours of Capernaum began to deride his minifirr,, and the.
p,harifees, .complying with the Herodi(\ns., made him fly the country;
and,·Ia.Hly, the afcendant to the oppofition of the Moon, with ·latitude,

But, to purfuc the r~fidue of his perfon, as \Yell as his condition, \'te
find, that Libra, a cardinal fign, of temper fanguine, hot,. and moifl,
afcends; and Jupiter is in the afcendant, near the po1nt of rifing, at birth,
in a fign of his 0\\'11 nature; and Ven.us, lady of the afcendant, in Aqua-
ries, a fanguine fign too, do all befpeak him to have been a perfon ofa very
level temper, and of a fanguine cornplexion. Venus, in trine to the·
a(cendant in the houfe of SC\turn, endued him with a fober cheerfulnefs
in his converfation: and Saturn, being in a fanguine fign too, in trine ,
of Jupiter in the afcendant, from the ninth, or houfe of ingenuity and1

thus Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn, are moU excellently united in hin1
'vith the beU of afp\~as. 'fo thefe we n1ay add the Ivloon, with almofl
a moiety of her orbc in her exaltation, and there in rrine of the Sun and
Mercury. The Moon is the great millre(l{ of life and nature, and the
trines to the Moon do gratify the native, even as firongly as if they fell
into the afcendant. Hence therefore is he anned frotn the Sun \V-ith a

pofe to dellroy a nativity fo oppofite to Jupiter and the afcendant; and,
being Hrong withal, he feems to threaten all good qualities with an over....
turnJ infufing nothing but choler, fury, and n1alice, into the native's
head; and, difpofing of the Moon, he makes her fo too. The Sun alfo
looks upon the cufp afcending with an evil quadrature, and fuch as ufu-
a.Ily renders a native 1nuch more proud and arnbitious than either w·ife or
good-natured; and Mercury, complying \vith the Sun in the fame afpeEl,
.e ndeavours to incline this f~cred perfon unto theft and lies. But ·what
now? ·Was Jefus thus? or rather does not AHrology belie him? No,
neither.. For, had theie evil afpeas courted an or~inary nature unto
evil tnanners r.aturally, yet would they not have forced him, but he
xn1
ght have overcome all by gracious habits. But much rnore than this
muH:we note in our ever ble!Ied Lord Jefus Chrifl:. For, he being_born
'vithout fin in his nature, the heavens wrought upon him in a different
tnanner of influence from what they do by us. For, feeing that the divine
nature withheld fo as no fin could enter him, the worn of afpeas (for
matter of qualification) .became the befl: unto him. For, by how much
an oppofition or a quartile is a fl:ronger afpea than a fextile or a trine,
n1ay they be withheld from doing harm, they muft needs afpea with the
greateft force of their virtu~s. And thus the oppofition of Mars, falling
~nto .his head, inHead <?f fury and choJ~r, adminiH~red the grea~e_r courage ·.
1n htm; and the quartile _
of the Sun, tnfiead of pnde and ambttton, gave
him the greate~ majefly and wifdom; and the quartile of ¥ercury, inHead
of lies, gave him the more prodigious wit; and the Moon wjth Algol's
Head, inHead of peevifh, made him the more foberly wife. But we muil. ·
remember, that, though ChriH could not fin, yet die he could. And
thus therefore oppofitions and trines, and evil fiars, were as evil to him,
, in as a high a degree, as unto the n1eaneft of us; for in all things, faving
fin, was he as we are. ,
. . .
Next proceed we to his body, only fo as to compare that too with our
fcheme. For, though we have no proof either of his fiature or his
colour, yet may we oe bold to fay (by rules ·of art) that, Libra afcend..
ing, he \vas fomewhat inclined to be tall and fair: but this was the lefs,
few degrees of that fign afcending, and they in terms of Saturn: elfe
is there nothing to except, unlefs the Moon, with Algol's Head, may
be thought fomewhat to abate from both. Jupiter in the aicendant

'dren, has a rich jewel in it; and the loi·d thereof looks p1eafingly upon
the afcendant, ,which ,argues he had a body-i~1fficiently fruitful for iffue.
The lady of the afcendant alio in the houfe' of children, in trine to the
·lo,rd of that houfe, and both in gooil aijJect unto the houfe of.~arriage
and the lord thereof, do all agree, that it \vas no hindrance in nature
'vhich fehdered our Saviour wifelefs or childlefs. No, it \vas his great
gravity, .or ratlier his infinite piety, "vhich, for the kingdom of Heaven's
iake, .led him to defpife nature's treafures. And hence catne it to pa!k,
that th~ church \vas His only .fpoufe; and by her hath he a numberlefs
offspring of holy ·faints unto his children. . The lord of the .fixth
is iti the- afcendant, an.d the great fort\lne; 'vhence were his fervants
true and faithful; only .one Judas (when that fixth houfe came b)' di-
reCtion to , the quartile of ·Mercury, in the entrance of the houfe of en-
mity). ·fatally bctr:ayed hiLn; and the refr, tnore out of fear than for
falfehood, foriook hitn and fled. .The lord of the ninth is very low, and
in quartile of Jupiter and Mars, and in conjunc;tion of the t\velfth lord;
which rendered his friet~ds men of lo\v c_ondition, and befriending him
Inoi·e by night than by day; as being terrified by 'mighty enetnies, and
not encouraged by any ou~ward promifes from· himfelf. The lord of
the ~hird is in the houfe of enmity, ai1d thence rendered moil ·of nis
neighbours bitter and envious, efpecially during the times of ill direc-
tions operating. Only. Jupiter, having dignities in that houfe, made
pther of his ~neighbours and kindred as rriuch his friends. Lafi:ly, the
Suh upon the cufp of the fourth feems fitly · to comply with that. iove-
reignty which ·ai:teilded upon liis death, and .appeared by his refurreB:ion
and afcenfion int9 qeaveil. When Adam .entered,. the Sun was juft
upon fetting.~' vVheil Jefus Chrift was incarnated, he \VaS jufi upon
rifihg. But at his birth he ·was at loweft. For it '¥as not the Sun 9f-
the Firmarnent, but the Sun of Righteoufnefs, who arofe 'vith healing
!n his wings. . · ~
Such was the fortutie 'of our Saviour, during his progrefs through this
earthly V\'orld; and fuch \Vere the qualities of his human mi)fd, even,
as the frars defcribe them; ·and .fuch \vas the complexion of his hu-
~an body, juft has the heavens do befpeak. And, though we never fa\V
his perfoh, or any true portraiture of ·the fame, ,yet knovv we, by the
fcheme of his pativity, that he _
was a man fomewhat tall 9f frature, of
an oval face,. of a ruddy complexion, bet\vee~ fair and bro\vn,. of a
grey eye, yet fharp ahd piercing, of a bright brown hair, · of an high

logy. ' And that thofc canons arc true, .it is no final! evidence, in that
nll the kno,vn paffagcs of his life fo punctually comply 'vith them.
And, be thctc cauons true, (as \\'C know by multitude of experience that
they arc certaiuly to,) then it appears by thcfe canons, that at miduiglu
t.)f Occeiuhcr the tv.'cnty-fifth day, \vas 1668;~ years complete. fiucc his

Jefus Chrift falJs on the t\vcnty-fifth day of December. His life points
out the very moment of titnc \Vbcn;on he came into the light. And the
fchcrne of the hca ~.:ens to that Inotncnt !s a true piCture of his life; and
' i\.1ch as no n1oment can the\v again, in any hundred years time, before
or aftet.
To thefc tnay be added, the fratne of the heavens at his death, fo fitly
fuiting \\'ith the time of the great bufinefs in. hand, and defcribing \Vhat

'vhich \Vas at that point of tin')e the fourth houfc, or the bottom of hea-

\Vhat is meant by Eletlions, is nething more than projcCling a fchcme ·
of the heavens, to find the feveral pofitions and configuratious of the
planets, on any given day, 'vhereon \VC propofe to begin any bufincfs of
Jmportance, to take a long or }nterefiing journey, to rnakc overtures of
xnarriage, or to purfue any object 0f our hnppincfs or advantage; for the
purpofe of chufing, what is vulgarly called, a lucky ti1ne to beg;n, that is,
when the influx of the principal fignificators'is fuch, as lhall correfpond
'vith the defires of our O\Vn 1nind, and \Vith the bufinefs, \Vhatevcr it may
be, \Ve \Viih to take in hand.

Part, that I 1night not be laugh~d at; vvhich I mull: o\vn the abfurclity
and folJy of tho.fe, who, on every ·ludicrous and trivial occafion, have
reforted \vith religious folemnity to this cufiom,. have given but too
tnuch occnfion to infpire; yet I will nO\V take leave to hope that
enough has been faid to !he\v, that in our more importa11t concerns, and
~n the real and heqrtfclt preturbations of our minds, upon the com-
mencement of any arduous and extenfive undertakii1g, it may be as ''ell
to choofe thofe feafons \vhen the be{t and 1nofi favourable influences of
the heavens concur,.as \V hen they put forth the moll: noxious and difcor-
dant irradiations. To a 'thinking mind, there cannot be a rnotnent's he-
fi~~tion, fince no man in his fenfes wot1ld prefer a fiormy tetnpefl:uous
day to ride out for pleafure, to thofe difiinguifhed by calmnefs and fere..
nity; nor \Vould he choofe an intenfe frofiy morning for the pleafures
of a cold bath, \vhich is luxuriant only in a milder feafon ; and yet all
thefe differences in the \Veather are produced by the varied ppfitions and
changes of the planets,. by an influx and efFeCl: upon the utnbient 1nattcr,
Which \Ve Call llO more fee than \Ve Can the· )nflux prQdUced by the fame

order of tinJes, (q fitly appropriated to all human concerns, that the
Scriptures pioufly recon1mend a due obfervatiou of them, and which the
P£1hnifr declares, are beautiful in theirjeajo11s! ,..
Thofe therefore, \vho \vifh to confult the heavens, previous to any.
important undertaking, iliould projeCt: the horofcope for that preci1e
time when they feel their inclinations molt completely bent. upon en-.
gaging in the bufinefs. This \Vill iliew them_ the particular influence of

T HE meteorological part of Afirology is that 'vhich enables us,
by a certain \vell-kno\vn influence of the planets, fecondcd by
obfervation and experience, to afcertain the caufes of th~ different
qualities of the air·
, the generation of meteors, thunder, lightning,
and all the various phenomena.qf the·heavens; \Vhence the prediClions
of the weather,.of the ternperature and quality of the four feafons of the
year, and of the profpect of a healthy and plentiful time, or of plague, ·
pefiilence, and famine, are neceffarily deduced.
This part of the fcience like\vife comprehends the doCl:rine of
eclipfes, comets, bla~ing frars, and the great conjuClions of the fupe-
rior bodies; whence the revolution. of etnpit'es, the fate of kingdoms, the·
renovation of cufioms, and the civil and political-- fluCtuation of all the'
provinces, frat.es, principalities, a~d commonwealths, upon the furface
of the globe, are fought out and predicted. We thall therefore arrange
thefe (peculations_under their refpeCl:ive heads, and ' confider them dif-
tinClly in the ord~r they fiand. -

Thefc exhalations, having penetrated the middle region, and attained
\tnto the height of the clements, are circun1volved \Vith a Otmy. matter,
oily, and apt to be inflamed. Thus having affumcd a body. it is vio.. ·
Jently carried about \Vith the air, until \\'ith the tnotion and vicinity of
the fire it is inflatned; and then, nouri!hed vvith tnorc cxhalatious conti-
llually dra'rvn unto it, it burns and converts itfelf into divers forms, ac-
cording to the difpofition of the matter then generated.
But others appear to fall, and flide through the air; the lightcll: part
bein·
g confumed, or dra\vn a\vay by fome other means, or the levity of it
being unable to fupport the gro!fcr part, lets it_dcfcend oblique]y through
the air; and, thus enlightened, is termed a falling fiar. Some conceive .
that this meteor afcends not fo high, being of a grofs body, (yet hot and
il:riving to afceud,) but is repulfed ~y a col~nefs of the middle r~gion, or
the moifinefs of the clouds; and fo, by reafon of its o\vn \Veiaht, and
by the oppofirion of the element, it is thrown dQwn again. The fubfiancc
of it is like a jelly, tranfpare~1t, lucid, and apt tQ be. iJJtJminated.
Fiery tneteors are ufually moved, by the region they are in, from caft
to \vcfi, according to the raptile motion of the fpheres; though Seneca
affirms that he perceived o~e which moved parallel to the horizon, from
the north by the wefi into· the fouth, and fq by the eall: into the north
again. This is by no. n1eans improbable, ftnc;e many lucid meteors move
\Vith the air, and .are impelled by the matter which nourithes them ; as
n1ay l>e fee.n by fire .in fiubble. A~1other \<.ind of m~teors are feen to
remove fuddenly from one place to another, Gafting forth fparks like
fire, and are by f<?me termed goats; whilfl: other$ ~gaiu appear fixed and
immoveable, both in refpeet to latit~de and lqngit.ude. Th'efe are ge-
nerated in any part of the heave~1s, and. (!t aU titl)es of the year ; but
rarely, in cold coun~ries, at. a1_1y o~her- tin1~ than autumn; for then the
heat is {ufficient to raife up the matter, and the temperature of the air is
apt to fuffer the. exhalations. to dravv' to it a £limy 1natter, \vhich cannot
e.xift in the fpring time,. the heat not being ..then fufficient to elevate
them. And in fi.tmmer, the exhalatiohs are not fo grofs, becaufe the
Sun's heat diffipates thof~ vapours, and rarefies the air; and, if it could
be dra\Vn together, the midd~~ region is fo cold, that it c;annot afcend to
the upper; and the winter quarter is fo cold and moifi., ~nd oppugnant
to fuch exhalations, t.hat it is quite unapt for the generation of meteors
Qf this kind.

~ard parts, by the ~oppofitioh and colctnefs of the out\vard air. Be.fides, the
. fire, and all combufiible t~ings, will burn more violently in w_

; and; the colder the,weather is, the more it '.vill fcorch. The-
reafon in all thefe _is the fame; fince the fire is found to·gro\v more. vio._
l~nt by how· much the. n1ore it is oppofed By the contr-~ry .qualjty of. the:
fubdued cofd. The cafe is the fame in the middle region of the.air ;~ for,
the upper part is made hot by the yjolent motion of it; a·nd by its prox-
imity to.the element of fire; and the ~ovv-er region·is made·.hot by reflec-..
t1
on of,the Sun beams; '\vhence the cold'included bet\veen them becotnes·_
the more violent in .proportion as the lower regiot~ is inflamea by the.
Sun's refleCtion, and by that means is cold_

Thefe divifions or portions oftlie air have no:determii1ed [pace; nor hath
t.he water in refpect of quality; for, by the.·motion ofthe celefr_
ial bpdies~
both cold and moi!l:ure being..drawn together, the element of water will
increafe., by which the·air mufi: of nece{fity diminifh. So, ~y the con-.
junction of heat.and moifl:ure, the fphere of water wjll·be ditninifhed; and"
the air as much.increa.fed. By this ·means the air more abounds in fum-·
mer than, in \Vi.nter, and theJwater more in \Vinter than·in fummer; ancf
thus the middle region-of the air is· occafionally contt;aCl:ed. and .dilated,·.
and is c~nfequently greater ·at one ~~me· than auoth~r-. ,
By the heat of the Sun-beams, and influence of the ftars; meteors are·
.elevated to the middle·.region of the a1r. Thofe vvhich py nature are tem--

OCCn \Vrtter firft, it 'Vould have been fooncr reduced. 1"hefc vapours,
or thick exhalations, dnnvn up irito the middle region of the air, are
ofte~l digell:cd and turned into \Vater, and fro1n thence. difiilled do\vn ]ike
tnill:s, or in very fm~~ll drops; for the greatetl: rain is fuppofed not to fall
far through the air, but out of the inferior part of the lo\ver regio~•··
It is generally conceived, that the rain \vhich falls from the middle
t:egion dcfcends in little orbs, \Vhcreby to pretervc itfelf, and to refit1:·
·the violct~ce of the air through \vhich it pafTes;. and it becorrlC~ finall, .
by rcafon. of the difiance and titnc it occupies in falling. For hail dc-
monfirates both the bigncfs and. rotundity of the drops which from
·hutnid exhalations, dra\vn up into the middle region,.are there convert-
ed into \\'ater; and, itntnediately as the drops difl:il dpwn, they arc con·
tratled. into ice by the coldnefs of the air, in that part \vhich is called
hail, deprived from the High Dut~h hagell, or from. the 1-febre\v cg~ll,,
\V hich lignifies congealed drops.. ~
In the \Vinter feafon-it is.. feldom obferved to hail, becaufe tlie cold itn
tl1e middle region is ·more ren1its than in \Varm weather; and in tummer-
time it is feldom obierved in any very hot day, becaufe the heat of the··
lo\ver region \vill not permit it to pafs, \Vithout diffolving it. before it
r.eaches the earth. But. in the. fj~ring, and in autuLnn,.\V·e frequently fee,.
and are fubjecr ..to, hail-ftorms; the heat being then fufficient to elevate.
the matter, and .yet not fo violent as to diffolve it in its fall. Someti1nes,.
ho\vever,.it happens that very large hail-ftones are precipitated at 1\iid-
fummer, or in. the very hotteft feafons; and thefe hail-fiones are then
the.greater·, if the ele;ated matter be fufficient, by ho\v much the more ·
its nature is oppofed by the lower region, made hot by. the reflection of
the Sun; for in all· times of the year, and in· all countries, there are more ·
and greater. fl:orms.of hail obferved.to fall in the day than.in the night.
There is unqucfiionably a fiery nature included in hail-fiones, very dif-
ferent from the heat of that fubtile vapour "·hich occafions it to afcend
the middle region; for by the force of contraries it is evidently congeal-
ed, as may be illull:rated by the fimple quality of fait, vrhich, being hot
aud dry,. is made of 'vater \vhofe natural. temperatures are diretlly oppo-
{ite; being cold and moifi: in open weather, or by the fire-fide, or in the
fummer feafon. Take a handful of falt and mix fome filO\.V \Vith it; ft.ir
"
them together till they incorporate; and they \vill immediately contract
thetnfelves into ice; \Vhich is done by antiperifrafis, or repulfion on every

The lower region of the ait·.receives all the-fermer qualities by nec~fftty
according tp the·\fever_al feafons of tl].e year; and by the means already
tnent~oned there are exhaled fr9m ti!e earth moift and crude vapours;
~he groifer parts being earthy, al1~ containing but little heat, they are un-
able to afcend to the middle reg1on; yet by the help of that heat, and
the attraB:ive virtue of the celefrial orbs, they are raifed above r&e earth,.
and there oftent.imes congeal ~efore they can be cliffolved into water.
Thefe are called frofts, whereof there be many kinds, according to the
, matter exhaled, and the temperature of the feafon. ·At fome times of the
. year, the ground in the mornings \¥ill be hoary, like the head ·of thytne,
and the grafs crifpeq with the froft; at other times rime-frofi, or con- .
gealea mifis, hang pendanf on the branches of tr-ees, or elfe black or wind
f1·ofis, which are not fo wholefome; for they confifi: of grofs and earthy
vapours, 'exhaled out of more undigefied humours, and are not fo eafily
difcdvered by the fight as by th~ fenfe of feeling.
\
•
There are other vapours exhaled, which are called mifts, derived from
· the mixture of air and water. .0 f thefe there are feveral forts; fame are
.thin and :fierile, and have not tnoifiure fufficient to 'beget water, nor is ·
the heat in them-fufficiently prevalent to elevate the grois humours, and
caufe them to afcend; but they hang upon the earth until the Sun rifes;
th~n he u'fually chafes thetn away, and, being diffipated, it becomes a
fine day.. · ·
Be(tdes· the ab_
ove, there are grofs n1ifrs or fogs, \Vhich are more
·earthy than the former, compofed of crude and undigefred vapours,
dra\rvn from corrupted places, out of fens and_\¥et mar!hy grounds.
Thefe are very unwholefome,.and unpleafant to the fmell; in proportion
·either to the noxious fiagnate waters from whence they were extraCted,
·Or to the putridity of the.air, occafioned by. a long continuance of calm ~
moifi weather. , ~
,
There is an0ther exhalation called· de,v,~ \vhich is a liquid vapour,
:extracted from w:ate~ or earth. This hath an affinity to frofr, as rain
hath to fnow; and are alike in the material caufe; the efficient eaufe
bein'g attributed to the ftars, and to the eoldnefs of ·the air. The
devvs are conceived to be very earthy and ponderous; for they do
11ot afcend' high, .but are converted into a watery fubA:ance ·a1moft
as foon as extracted, being obferved much more upon lo\-v and wet
grounds than upon high and dry hills; aud thicker tlpon the hum-
ble ihrub than upon trees of an high and exalted ~at\lre like the loftyr

The ufiml time of thefe de\vs is in the evening ; the heat of the Sun,
i1cclining, being then unable to fupport the n1ctcors \Vhich he raifcd in
the d.\y; nnd, on his deferring the hcn1ifphc.rc, thofc that "'ere n1orc ele-
vated nutll. like\vifc fall. 'fhc hotter the day, the greater are the exha-
lations j and the nights nrc then ufually colder, to convert them into
\vatcr. All dc\vs arc obfcrvcd to be greater at the Moon's incrcafing;
but greatefl of all at the fall. The fcafon of the year is to be conlidercd,
and the 'vcather; for the hotter the day is, the colder \viii be the night,
by reafon of the fhado\v \vhich the tcrrcfirial globe then makes; as is exem-
plified by.the fhadcs of trees, or of any other interpofed body, \vhich are
colder in fummer-tin1e than in \Vinter, in refpeCl: of the air in general.
For in fl1ado\vcd places, in the heat of fummer, the air, as in oppolition
to the heat., is found to contract itfelf into a groffcr body ; frotn \Vhence
it appears that the \vhole element of ail· is by nature cold.
There is a dew that flies in the air like fmall unt\vified fi1k ; \vhich,
falling upon the ground, or on pl~nts, converts itfelf into a form like
fpiders' \vebs. The matter they conlift of is an earthy and flimy vapour
or exhalation, fotnething dry; and they are found equally in fpring, fum...
mer, and autumn ; but in thefe northern countries they are moft frequent
\vhen the Sun is near l.ibra, the days being then temperately \Varm, the
cart~ not exceeding dry, nor yet overcharged \Vith moifture.
There is alfo another fort of de\v, called honey-de\V, which conftfts of
earthly exhalations mixed \Vith wateri01 vapours ; and rnany fuppofc them
to be exhalations from plants and fl.o\vers; and this more evidently appears
from fugar-canes, and divers kinds of Indian reeds, "\vhich have, in the
morning, dews hanging upon them, in tafl:e refembling honey; and argue.
by their f\veetnefs, that they are extraCted from the plants. Thefe honey-
dews afford plenty to the fiores of the indufirious bee; nor have their
purveyors much labour or trouble to procure their loading ; but, though
thefe .honey-dews arc good for bees, they are defl:rud:ive to tnany kinds
of animals, as !beep, g~ats, deer, and the like ; and are in general inju-
rious to aU fruits and blooming flowers; efpecially to hops, grapes, and
corn ; .and often blafr them in their prin1e. It \Vas for the purpofe of di-
verting the(e evil effects, tnat Numa, one of the Roman kings, fuperfii,.

airy and \Vatery exhalations. For, if more ·rainbows than one appear at a
time, it is certain that they are produced by refleCtion of one another;
but the ·-colours in the fecond \Vill be weaker than thofe in the firft; and
the third -rainbow will be more palid thln the fecond, if there happen to
be three, 'vhich is very feldom : then the colours in the fir!l: will be coun-
tercbanged i~ the fecond, and the third,again like the firfr. The arches in
the clouds or rainbow ufually continue longer than the circles about the
Sun, becaufe the di!l:ance in thefe are-fo great, that his beams cannot fo
f-oon diffipate the exhalations ·\Vhich -caufed them. Rainbows in the night-
tim~ ar.e exceeding rare,, b.ecaufe they are made by the _
Moon, 'vhofe
beams are too \veak to caufe fuch reflections upon any cloud at fa·great a

The Aurora IJorcalis, or Northern I~ight, is nn extraordinary meteor,
or lun1inons appearance, fuc,ving itfc)f in the night-time, in the north...
ern part of the heavens. lt is ufnally of a rcddifh colour, inclining
to ycllo\v, and feuds out fi·cqucnt cotrufcations of pale light, 'vhich
fccn1 to rife frotu the hori,zon in a pyran?idal undulatingform, and lhoot,
~vith great velocity, up to the zct~ith.
The Aurora Borealis nppcars tnofi commonly in form of an arch ;
chiefly in the fpring and uutun111-; after a dry year. ~rue arch is partly
bright, partly dark; but generally tranfparent. And the matter of •
'vhich it confifl:s is alfo found to hayc no effect on the rays of .light
,~hich pafs through it. D.r. I-Tan1il~on obferves, that l1e could J?lainly
- d1fcern the fn1allcft fpcck tn the Pleiades through the dcnfity of thofe
clouds \vhich fortned part of the Aurora Borealis, in 1703, without
the leaft diminution ofits fplendour, or increafe of twinkling.
This kind of meteor never appears near the equator, and \vas fo rare in
England, that none are recorded in our annals fince that remarkable one,
November 14,) li74, till the furprifing Aurora Borealis, 1\farch 0, 1716,
"\Vhich appeared for three night~ fucceffi.ye}y, ana put the '\t\7hO}e kingd~m
into the utmoft confiernation, terrifying brutes as well as men. Indeed
the horfes '\vere fo frightened" that no fences could keep them in the
inclofures; it was in1poffib!e to travel in the evenings, and the road-
waggons, and all other carriages, 'vere obliged to lie by ilumediately
as the Sun \Vas do,vn. In .the year 1707, and 1708, fiye fmall ones
'Were obferyed in little more than eighteen months; but they have no
comparifon with the above. Hence it Jhould fecm, ·that the air, or
earth, or botl.1, are not at all times difpofed to produce this phenomenon,
for though it is poffible it 1nay happen in the day-ti1ne in bright moon..
fuine, or in cloudy 'veather, and fo pafs unobferved ; yet that it fliould
appear fo frequent at fome times, and fo feldon1 at others, cannot \veil
this '\vay be accounted for. That in ~farch, 1710, 'vas Yifible to the
_
,vcft of Ireland, and the confines of Ruffia, and to the eafr ofPoland;
extending at leafi ncar thirty degrees of longitude, and from about the
fiftieth degree in latitude, over almofi: all the north of ~urope: and in
all places at ,the f4\Ille time ~t exhibited the like 'vondcrous appearances.
~iany attempts have been made to affign the caufe of this phenome-
, non. Dr. Halley itnagines the ,,·ntery vapours, or ej(luuia, rarified ex-
ceedingly by fu~terraneous fire, and tinged 'vith fulpburcous firean1s,
,:\vhich 1nany naturalifis have fuppofed to be the caute of earthquakes,

1vhich, by a firong and quick friCtion, emit light in the dark : to which
fort of Hght this feetns to have a great affinity.
The celebrated lVI. de 1\fairan, in an cxprefs treatife·on the Aurora·
Borealis, ·publiihed in 1731, affigns its caufe to be the' zodiacal light,
... "\vhich, according to hin1, is no other than the Sun's atmofphere : this·
light happening, on forne o~cafions, to rncet the upper parts of our air,
on. the fide of the lirnits where univerfal gravity begins to act mo.re'
forcibly towards the earth than towards the Sun, falls ,into our atmo-
fphere; to a greater or lefs depth, as its fpecific gravity is greater or Iefs
<;ompared with the air through which it paffes. 1VIr. Fuller thinks the
caufe of the Aurora Borealis not ovvjng to the zodiacal light, as 1\I. de
1\f~ira:p. fupp'ofes; but to particles of out atn1ofphere, driven beyond its
limits by.the i1npulfe of the light of the Sun. On this fuppofition, he·
endeavours to a~count for the phenomena obferved concerning this light..
He fuppofes the zodiacal light, and the tails of con1cts, to be owing to.
a fitnilar caufc. This light fomctimes a1)pears re1narkably red, as it
happened Dec. S, 1737, of which there ""\\-rere a variety of account&

Ever fince the identity of lightning, and of the electric tnatter, has

cation of a~rial meteors in the principles of electricity ; and they feem to

formed ofele.Cl:rical matter. Befides the rnore obvioUS· and kno\YD ap-

that the tournzalin is kno\v n to en1it and auforb.the electric fluid only

Pofiti,-e and ncgativ·c elcCl:ricity in the air, ,,,.jth a proper quantity of·

other tneteors, fo1nctin1cs fcen in a (crene fky. 1\Ir. Canton has fincc~
contrived to exhibit this tneteor by tneans of the ·Torricellian vacuum, in
a gl1fs tube about thtee feet long, and fealed hermetically. \Vhcn one·

of this contriYance, for exhibiting the appearance ofan ./lurora Borealis

930 AN ILL 'USTRATION
.All this, bowever, appears to be ·little more than the conjectural
{peculation of modern philofophers. 'The ancients,. it is plain, never
faw this phenon1enon ; nnr did it ever occur in thejr days, fince no
mention whatever is made :of it in their writings, nor is any notice
taken of it in the records of the tnoderns, until the year .J 574, which is
the firfr time, I believe, .the-A?lrora ·Borealis ever made its appearance
in the world; ·.and, .being ·a new phenomenon in nature, rnuH un-
doubtedly have1
·been produced by fome great conjunilion, or by the vio.:.
lent .heat ~of fame irivifible cpmet, ·or by a variation in the frame and
fyfiem ..of.the world, ·or bf the heavenly bodies, which at that particular .
rera mufi ·h<!ve taken place, artd which frill continues, at times, to pro-
duce the fame luminous and fiery appearance.
Blazing fiars, ·are fiery luminous appearances, generated in the upper
· region of the·air, and formed into a body, whence they take an oblique
direCtion '\Vith aflonifhing velocily, and dcfcend to the earth. rfhe light
.they convey will.fon1etimes exceed that of the 1\foon, as V\ras the cafe

·to fouth, very near the ftnface of th~ earth, and was fuppofed to fall into
the fea.· T.hcir appearance is at once b~autiful and tre1nendous.
Sigriior Beccaria, in one of his philofophical papers, makes tnention
-of a very remarkable one, which appeared about an hour after fun-fet,
and direCted its courfe itntnediately towards the fpot "\Vhere he and fame
friends were walking. It gre\V apparently larger and larger as it ap-
proached,' and went off very I)car thetn ; when it left their t~ccs, hands,
and clothes, '\vith the eartli, and all t~1e neighbouring objeCts, fuddenly
.illun1inated '\Vith a diffufed and lambent light, 'vithout any vifible noife.

hnve.h:ft philofophcrs tnucb in the dark, Thofe \Vho lived before Arif-
totlc accounted for them by fuppofing the heavenly fpaces full of an
infinite ntunbcr of fiars i and tnany of them too rernote, or too fl)'lall, to
have ever cotnc under the notice of atlronorncrs ; thcfe invifiblc fiars they
fnrthcr fuppofcd to move b)C their O\\ n pr0pcr motion every \vay; finifh-
ing their coudcs in very unequal times. And a comet, according to them,
\vas a vall: heap or afTetnblage of thcfe little fiars, meeting together, by
rcafon of the inequality of their modons, and uniting into a vifiblc mafs ;.
\vhich mufl: again difappeJr, as thofc ftus fcparated, and each proceeded
in its courfc. But: ho\v thofe fiars fhould thus n1ect, coalefce, and fonn
a body, \vhich in aJl politions of the Sun fhould refemble a tail, and again
feparate, is totally inexplicable. This opinion Ariftotle overturned, by
fubfl:ituting another in its fiead: he infiHed that comets \Vere only a. kind ·
of tranlient fires, or tneteors, confifiing of e~halations raifed to the up-
per region of the air, and there fet on fire, far bclo\v the Moon,s courfe.
But neitheF is this hypothefis more juft than the other ; for, on this prin-
ciple,. the light of the comet, being independent of the Sun, \Vould be
difperfed every \vay alike, \Vithout any appearance of a train, or tail,
\vhich is contrary to the phenon1ena. Moreover they are obferved at the
.fi1me tin1e in places en the earrh very remote from each other. Befides,
the modern afl:ronomers \Vho have n1eafured the difiance bet,vcen the
comets and the earth, find thJt the comets have no fenfible diurnal paral-
]ax; \Vhich could not be, \vere they not tnuch more rcn1ote than the
Moon, whofe parallax is fenfiblc: and yet, as they have a fenfible an-
nual parallax, they are not fo remote as the fixed ftars. Tycho Brahc
'vas the firft among the moderns, \Vho after diligently obferving the comet
of 1577, and fi~ding that it had no fenfible diurnal parallax, affigned.it
its true 'place in the planetary regions. ·
Hevelius, from a great number ofobfervations, propofes it as his opi-
nion, that the con1et~, like the folar n1aculre, or f.pots,· are formed and
condenfed out of the groff'er exhalations of hi? body. In \Vhich notion
he agrees nearly \vith l(epler, 'vho maint4tins, that cotnets are generatei
in the rether in vafl: numbers, like fi!l1es in the ocean ; though they do
not all become vifible, either becaufe of their i(nallncfs, or becJufc the}~
lie a long time uuder the horizon.
But Sir lfaac l'c\vton has f11e\vn tl1e fallacy of this hypothefis, by
proving that the comet of 1680, in its pa!fage through the neighbour-
11ood of the Sun, \Vould have been diHipated had it confilled of exhala-
tions of rhe Sun and planets ; for the heat of the Sun, it is allo\ved,
is as the Jenfity of his rays, i. c. reciprocally us th• fquares of the

.difrances of places fron1 the Sun; Wherefor.e, fince the diftance of that
con1etjn its perihelion, Decen1ber the 8th, \vas obierved to be to the dif-
tance of .the earth from the Sun nearly as 6 to I ooo ; the Sun's heat in
' the ·comet, a't that titne, was to his heat ·with us at Midfulnn1er, as
IOooooo to 36, or 28000 to 1. And again, finding by experi1nent that
the heat of boiling water is little more than three times the heat ofour dry
earth', when expofed to the Midfurruner's Sun ; and affuming the heat
of red-hot iron to be about thrre or four times as great as that of boiling
~vater ;, he thence concludes, that the heat of the dried earth, or body of
the comet in its perihelion, muft be near 2009 times as great as that of
red-hot iron. ·
Such an immenfe heat once acquired in its perihelion, the con1et mull:
be ·a long tin1e .in cooling again. The fame author computes, that a
globe of red-hot iron, ,of .the ditnenfions of our earth, \vould fcarce1y be
cool in · soooo years. If then the co_
met be fuppofed to cool 100 times
as fafr as red-hot iron, yet fince its heat was 2000 J times greater, fup..
pofing it of the bignefs of the earth, it would not be cool in a million of
\years.

James Bernouilli, in,his Syfl:ema Cometarum, fuppofes foo1e primary
planet revolving rout}d the Sun in· the fpace of four years and one hun-
dred and fifty feven days, and at the difiance from his body of 2583
femidiameters of the magnus orhis ; this planet, he' concludes, either
from its vaft di.france or fmallnefs, to be invifible to us; .but, however,
to have, at various difiances from him, feveral fate11ites moving round
him, and fometimes defcending as lo\V as the orbit of Saturn ; and that
thefe becoming vifible to us, when in their perigreum, are what we caiJ
comets.
Des Cartes advances another, opinion -; he conjed:ures that ..con)ets are
only fiars, formerly fixed, like the reft, in the heavens ; but which, be-
co~ing by degrees covered with maculre, or fpots,~ and·at length wholly
robbed of their light, cannot keep their place, hut are carried offby the
vortices of·the circumjacent fiars ; and, in proportion tq their magnitude
and folidity, moved in fuch manner as to. be brought nearer ·the orb of
Saturn ; and thi1s, coming \>Vithin reach of the Sun's light, rendered
vifible. 1
· But the vanity of a11 thefe hypothefes ·abundant1y appears from the
phenomena of comets ; the chief of \Vhich are as follow : tft. 1·hofe
comets, which move according to the order of the ligns, do al1, ·a little
before they difappear, either advaqce fio\ver than ufual, or elfe go·ret1"o-

grade!, if the Earth be bct\vccn them and the Sun : and more f\viftly, if
the Earth be fituarc in a contrnry part. On the other hand, thofe \vhich
proceed contrary to the order of the figns, proceed rnorc f\viftly than
ufual, if the Earlh be bet\\·ccn thetn nnd the Sun ; and more flO\\' ly, or
go retrograde, \vhen the Earth is in a contrary part. ~d. So long as
their velocity is incrcafed, they n1ovc nearly in great circle~ j but to-
'vards the end of their courfe, they deviate from thofe circles ; and, as
often as the Earth proceeds one way, they go the contrary \\'ay. 3d.
They move in ellipfcs, having one of their foci in the centre of [he
Sun; and, by radii dra\vn to the Sun, defcribe areas ·proportionable to
the times. 4th. The light of their bodies, or nuclei, increafes in their
recefs from the Earth· to\vard the Sun ; and on the contrary. decreafes in
their recefs from the Sun. 5th~ "rheir tails appear the largeft and
brightefi: immediately after their tranfit through the region of the Sun;
or after their perihelion. 6th. "fhe tails always decline from a ju!l op-
po1ition to the Sun to\vards thofe parts which the bodies, or.nuclei,
pafs over, in their progrefs through their orbits. 7th. This declina-
tion, ccettris paribus, is the fmallefr, \vhen the heads, or nuclei, approach
nearefr the Sun; and is lefs, ftill~ nearer the nucleus of the comet, than
towards the extremity of the tail. Sth. ·The tails are fome\vhat brighter, ·
and more diilind:ly defined, in their convex than in their concave part.
9th. 1~he tails a)\vays appear broader at their upper extreme than near
the centre of the comet. 10th. The tails are al\vays tranfparent, and the
fmallefi: fiars appear through them.
Thefe are the chief phenomena of comets; ·\vhich it ·is evident, can-
not eafily be reconciled with the \Vild nofions of the ancients, and the
"veak conjectures of many of the moderns. Indeed, there \vere fome.
Pliny tells us, among the ancients~ \vho, " had j\.lfter notions ; 'vho
u ~ook thefe :!tars to be perpetual, and believed they .moved in their
" proper orbs; but 'vere never feen, unlefs \vhen left by the Sun."
Apollonius Myndius declared, that he took comets for regular fiars;
and ventured to forctel, that one day the periods and la\VS of their motion
'vould be difcovered. And more fully Seneca, ~refr. Nat. lib. vii. cap.

his predietion V\·e have fee~ accomplifhed in our days, by the great Sir
lfi1ac Newton ; \V ho1e doCtrine is as follo\vs :
..fhe comets, he fays, are compact, folid, fixed, and durable, bodies;
in one word, a kind of planets ; \vhi~h tnove, in very oblique orbits,
every way with the grcateft freedotn; perfevering in their motions, even
againfi the courfe and direction of the planets ;- and their tail is a very
thin flender vapour, etnitted by the head, or nucleus, of the comet.
ignited or heated by the ~un. T.his at once folvcs all the foregoing
phenomena: for, " It is evident, tbat thofe \vhich proceed according to
u · the order of the figns, a little· before they difappear, n1ufi move tnore
'' fio\vly, or appear retrograde, if th~ Earth be bet\vixt them and the
" Sun ; and fwifter if the earth be in a contrary part. On the contrary,
" thofe proceeding againft the order of the figns," &c. For fince this
courfe is not among the fixed ftars, but among the planets; -~s the mo-
tion of the earth either confpires with thetn, or goes again!l: thetn ; their
appearance, '\vith regard' to the Earth, mufl: be changed; and, like the
planets, they mutt fometimes appear f,vifter, fon1etimes flower, and
1ornetimes retrograde-
. " When the comets move the fvviftcfl:, they muft
" proceed in firaight lines; but in the end of their courfe, decline,"
&c. Becaufe, .in the end of their courfe, \Vhen they recede al~oft di-
rectly from the Sun, that part of the apparent n1otion \vhich arifes from
the parallax rnuft bear a greater proportion to the \Vhole appare-nt
motion.
The comets n1ufl: 1nove in ellipfes, having one of their foci in the· c~n­
tre of the Sun. Becaufe they do not wander precarioufiy froth one
fictitious vortex to another; but, tnaking a part of a folar fyi~em, return
perpetually, and run a confiant round. Hence* their elliptic orbits be..
ing very long and eccentric, they become invifi~le \vhen in that part
moft remote from the Sun. Frotn confidering the curvity of th~ paths
of cop1ets, Sir Ifaac·concludes, that, \vhen they difappear, they are much
beyond the orb of Jupiter; -and that in their perihelion, they frequently
~efcend below the orbit of Mars and the inferior planets. The light of
their nuclei mu!l: increafe in their recefs from the Sun, and vice CZ.Jt~fa..: ·
Becaufe, as they are in the regions of the planets, their accefs to\vard the
Sun bears a confiderable proportion to their whole diftance.
'
From obferv:uions of the comet of I 68o,. Sir Ifaac Ne\vtoii found
that the vapour in the extremity of the tail, January 25th, began to
afcend from the head before December 1 1 ; and had therefoie fpent
~ore than forty-five days in its afcent ; ~ but that all the tail 'vhich ap:

'vhen the con1ct \Yas ncar the Sun, afccndcd prodigionfiy fv..·ift; and at:.
tcr\\"ards continued to afcend \Yith a motion retarded by the gravity of
its particles; and by that afccnt incrcafcd the length of the tail ; hut the
tail, not\vithftanding its length, confifled almoft \vholly of "apours,
'Yhich had afccndcd from the tirnc of its perihelion; and the vapour
\vhich afcendcd firft, and cotnpofed the cxtrcn1e p~trt of the tail, did not

fron1 us to be vifible. Hence alfo, the tnils of comets that arc !hortcr

heads they had at the beginning, continue cafily to tnovc .along \vith
their heads through the celefiial regions; \Vhence alfo the vacuity of
thofe regions is argued.
Their tails mull: appear the largefl: and brightefi in1n1cdiately after

'fhe nuclei, \vhich we occa:fionally call the heads.and bodies ofcon1ets,
vievvetl through a telefcope, fhew a very different L:1ce fron1 thofe of the
fixed ftars, qr planets. 'I'h,ey are liable to·apparent changes, which Sir
lfaac Newton afcribes to changes in the atn1ofphere of comets: and this
opinion was confirtncd by obfervations of tpe co1net in 17•14. Stur1nius
tells us, ·that, obferving the comet of 1oso with a telefcopc, it appeared
like a coal di1nly glowing, or a rude mafs of tnatter .illuminated \Vith a·
dufky fumid light, lefs feniible at the extretnes t_han in the middle; ra-
ther than as a ftar, which appears with a round'difk, and a vivid light.
Hevelius obferved of the comet of 1001, that its body was of a yel-
lowi!h colour, very bright and confpicuous, but without any glittering
light: in the middle was a denfe ruddy nucleus, almofi equal to Jupiter~
encompa!fed with a much fainter thinner matter. February 5th its head
was fome\vhat bigger and brighter; of a gold colour; but its light more
dufky than the refr of the fiars : here, the nucleus appeared divided into·
feveral parts. February oth, the di£k was leffcned; the nuclei fiill. exifl:-
ed, though lefs than before: one of then1, on the ]ower p~rt of the difk,
.on the left, n1uch denfer and brighter thari the ·refi ; its body round, and
rept~efenting a very lucid little ftar : the nuclei fiill encon1pa1Ted with
another kind of thatter. February 1oth, the bead fo1ne\vhat more ob-
fcure, and the nuclei more confuted, but brighter a;t top than bottom.
I~'ebruary .13th, the head din1inifhed-much, both inrnagnitL~de and bright-
nefs. :1\'Iarch 2d, its roundnefs a little i1npaired, its edges lacerated, &c.
!\larch 28th, very pale and exceeding thin; its n1atter much difperfed;
and no diftinet nucle'us at all appearing. .- ...
W eigelius, who faw the cotnet of I50,i~ the 1\Ioon, and a little
cloud illutninated by the Sun at the fi1me time, obferved that the J\1oon,
through the telcfcope, appeared of a continual luminous furface; but
the comet very different ; being perfeCtly like a little clo.ud in the hori-
zon, illun1inated by the Sun. l?rom. thefe obfervations it was, that
Hevelius concluded ~omets to be like tnaculre, or fpotsJ forrned out of
the folar exhalations: , ·

The efiin1ates that have .been given by Tycho, Hevelius, and forne
others, of the tnagnitude of comets, are not fufficiently accurate to be
depended up~n ; for it .does not appear~ that they diftinguiilied be.t\vecn
the nucleus and the furrounding atn1ofphere: "fhus Tycho con1putes
that the true diameter of the comet in 1.5 77 was in proportion to the
diameter of the earth as 3 is. to 14. Hevelius made the diameter of
the comet of_1062 to that of the earth as 52 to 100. 1'he diameter of

the :ttn1ofphcrc is oft~n ten or fifteen tin1cs as great ns that of the
nucleus: the Jonncr, in the comet of 1G82, ' vhcn u1cafured by fJunr-
ficacl, ,,·as found to be t\vo rninutcs, but the dtantetcr of tltc nucleus
only clc\·eu fcconds. Sotne comets, fron1 the apparent n1agnitude and
difhtncc coinpared, have bccnJudgcd to be n1uch larger than the 1\Joon,
nnd even cc1ual to fomc of the prirnary planets. 'fhc diatnetcr of that
of 17.,14, '''hen at the di!lancc of the Sun frorn us, meafured about one
n1inutc, and therefore its diatnctcr tnufi be about three tin1es the dia-
xneter of the Earth: at another tirne the diarneter of its nucleus ' vas
nearly equal to that of Jupiter.
"fhe lengths of the tails of comets arc various, and depend on a Ya-
riety of circumfiances. Longomontanus mentions a comet that in.
1018, Dccetnber 1o, had a tail ab_ovc one hundred degrees in length ;
that of 1oso, according to Sturmius, about the 2oth of Noven1her,
was but f1nall; at mofr, not exceeding t \Venty degrees in length; in a
]ittle tin1e it grew to a)ength of ftxty degrees, after "\Vhich it d\Vin<JJed
very fenfibly. The comet of 1744 h'ad a tail '\vhich at one time appeared ·
to extend above fixteen degrees fron1 its body ; and which, allo\ving
tbe Sun~s parallax ten feconds, muft have been above t'venty-threc mil--
lions of miles in Iength.
Sir Ifaac Newton 1he-\vs,· that the atmofphere of comets '~ill furniflt
vapour fufficient to form tbeir tails; this l1e argues from that \Vonderful
rarefaction obferved iFI our air at a di!lance from the earth : a cubic inch
of comrnon air, at the difiance of half the Earth's dian1eter, or four
thoufand miles, 'vould necefiarily expand itfelf fo £1.r as to fill a fJ.>ace
larger than the whole region of fiars. Since then the coma or at-
m.ofphcre of a comet is ten tirnes higher than the furface of the nucleus,
counting from the centre thereof) tbe tail, afcendmg much higher, m.ufi:
neceffarily be in1menfely rare : fo that it is no 'Yonder the fiars fhould
be vifible through it.
Now, the afcent of vapours into the tail of the comet he fuppofes
occafioned by the rarefaCtion of the matter of the atmofphcre at the
tirne of the perihelion. Smoke, it is obferved,· afccnds the chirnney by
the itnpulfe of the air \vhcrein it floats; and air rarefied by heat, afcends
by din1inution of its.fpecific gravity, taking UI) the fmokc al~~g \\~ith
it; '\Vhy then {hould not the tail ofa ~o1net be fuppofed to be ra1fed after
the fan1c manner by th~ Sun? for the fun-beatns do not act on the
tnediunlS they pafs through any other\vife than byreflection and rarefac-
tion. The refleCting particles, then, being '\Yarn1ed by the aCtion, \v!ll

again warm the rether 'vherewith they 3:re comp0unded ; and tbi~, rare-
fied by the heat, \vill have its fpecific gravity, wher~by it before teniJed
to.defcend, dimini!hed by ~he rarefaction, fo as to afct:nd, and can~y
along with it thofe refleCting particles whereof the tail of the comet is
compofed. This afcent of the vapours '!fill be promoted by their cir-
cular motion round the Sun; by n1eans whereof, they will endeavour
to recede from the Sun; while the· Sun's atmofpbere, and the othet tnat-
ters in the celeilial {paces, are ~ither at reft, or nearly fo ·; as having
no motion but what they receive from the Sun's circumrotation. Thus
are the vapours rai{ed into the tails of comets in the neighbourhood of
.the Sun~ "'-Vbere the orbits are moft curve ; and where the con1ets~ being
within the denfer attnofphere of the Sun, have their tails of the greateft
length.
, The tails thus produced, by preferving that motion, and at the fatnc
time gravitating to\vard the Sun, wil11nove round his body in ellipfes, in
like manner as their heads; and by this means, "Vvill ever accompany,
and freely adhere to, their head. In efteCl:, the gravitation of the va-
pours towards the Sun \Vi11 no more occafion the tails of the comets to
for£:1.ke their heads, and £1-ll down to\vards the Sun, than the gravitation
of their heads \viii occafion then1 to·fall offfrom their tails; but by their
·cotnmon gravitation they will either fall down together to the Sun, or
be together fu(pended or reta1;ded. This gravitation~ therefore, does
not at all hinder but that.the heads and tails of comets may receive and
retain any pofition towards 'Cach other, which either the above-men-
. tioned caufes or any other may occafion~ 'fhe tails, therefore, thus
produced in the perihelion of comets, 'vill go off, along with their heads,
into remote regions ; and either return thence, togetl1~r \Vith the comets,
after· a long feries of years; .. or, rather, be there loft, and vani!h by lit-
tle and little, and the comets be left bare; till at their return, defcend-
ing towards the s.un, foine little ihort tails arc gradually and flowly
produced from the heads ; 'vhich, afterwards, in the perihelion, de-
fcencling into 'the Sun's atlnofphere, will be ilJlmenfely increafed.
. .
The vapours when t4eyare thus dilated, rarefied, and diffufed through
all the celefiial regions, the fame author.obferves, may probably, by little
and little, by means of their O"\!Vn gravitY., be attracted qown to the pla-
nets, and become. intermingled with their atmofpheres. lie-adds 1ikc-
'\vife, !hat, for the confervation of the vvater and moifiure ofthe planets,

finefi, fubtilefi, and. the heft, part of our air, and \Vhich is abfolutely
requifite for the life and bciug of all things, cotncs principally from the
cotncts.
·On this principle, there· fccms to be fome foundation for the popular
opinion of prefagcs from comets; fince the tail of a comet, thus inter-
·mingled with our atmofphcrc, may produce changes very fcnfiblc in ani-
mal and vegetable bodies. Another ufe \vhich he conjeCtures comets m,ay ·
be .defigned to ferve, is that of recruiting ·the Sun with frelh fuel, and re-
pairing the confumption of his light by the ftreams continually fent forth
in every direttion from that lutninary. In fupport of this conje~ure he
obferves, that comets in their perihelion may fuffer a diminution of their
projectile force by the refifiance of the folar atmofi>here; fo that by de-
grees .their gravitation tovtards the Sun may be fo far increafed as to pre-
cipitate their fall into his body.
There have been various coujeClures about the generation of the tail
of comets. Appian, Tycho Brahe, and fomc others, apprehended that
they \Vere produced by the Sun's rays tranfmitted through the nucleus of .
the comet, \vhich they fuppofed to be tranfparenr, and- there refracted as
in a lens of glafs~ fo as to form a beam of light behind the comet. Des
Cartes aceounted for the phenomenon of the tail by the rarefaaion oflight
from the head of the cotnet to the eye of the 1peCtator. .Mairan fuppo!es
that the tails are formed out of the lutninous matter that compofes the
Sun's .atmofphere; M. De la Lande combines this hypothefis \Vith that
of N e\vton above recited. l\1r. Ro\vning,·\Vho is not i:'ltisfied \Vith Sir
1faac's opinion, accounts for the tails of comets in the following manner.
It is· well kno\vn, fays he, that, \vhen the light of the Sun paffes
through the atmofphere of any body, as the earth, that \Vhich paffes
on one fide is, by the rarefaCtion thereof, made to converge to\vards th:tt
\Yhich palfes on the oppofite one; and the convergency is not \vholly cf-
fetled either .a't the .entrance of the light into the atrnofpherc, or at its go-
ing out; but, beginning at its entrance, it incrcafcs in c\·cry point of its
progrefs. It is alfo agreed, that the at1nofpheres of the co1ncts are very
large and denfe. He therefore· fuppofcs that, by fitch tin1c as the light

of the Sun has paffed thro~gh a confiderable part of the atn1ofphere of a
comet, th.e rays thereof are fo far refraCted ~owards each other, that they·
the~ begin fenfibly to.illuminate it, or rather the vapours floating there.
in, and fo r'enqer that part they have yet to pafs through vifible to us: and
that this portion of the atmofphere of a comet thus illuminate_d appears
to us in form,of a beam of the Sun's·Jight, and p'lffes under the deno-
mination of a co~et's tail. · r •
.
We ?ave an enquiry into the caufe of the t~ils of cotnets, by Mr. ·
Eu'"'
ler. · He thinks.. there is a great affinity bet\veen thefe tails,. the zodiacal
light, and the Aurora Borealis; and that the common caufe of them all
is the aCtion of the Sun's light on the attnofphere of~ the cotnets, of the
Sun, and of the Earth. He fuppofes, that the ilnpulfe of the rays of
light on the atrnofphere·of comets .may drive fotne of the ~finer particles
of that atmofphere far beyond its limits; and .that this force of impulfe,
combined.with that of gravity·towards the comet, would produce .a tail~; I
which would ahvays be in oppofition to the Sun, if the comet did not
move. But the motion of the comet in its orbit, and about its axis, mufl:
vary 'the pofition and -figure of the,~ tap, giving it a curvature, and devia..
tion fro.m a line .drawn from the ~entre of the Sun to that of the comet.;
aud that this deviation \vill be gr~ater, as the orbit'of the comet has the
greater curvature, and thatthe motion of the comet is more.rapid. · It may
even happen,~ that the velocity of the comet, in its perihelion, may be fo
great, that the force of the Sun's rays may produce a new tail before the
old one can follo\N; in 'vhich cafe the comet n1ight have tv·lO or more
tails. · The poffibility of this is confirtned by the comet of z744, \\'hich
was obferved to have feveral tails \vhile it was in its perihelion.
.
• Dr. Hamilton u~ges feveral objections ~gainft t~e Newtonian hypothe-
fis; and concludes that the tail .of a comet is formed of matter \vhich hath
not the po\ver of refracting or reflecting the rays of light: hut that it is
a lucid or felf...fhining ·fubil:ance, and, from its fimilarity 'to the Aurora
Borealis, ·produced by the :fatne caufe, and a proper eleCtrical .phenome-
non. Dr. Halley, !eemed inclined' to this hypothefis, when he faid, that
the fireams oflight in the Aurora Borealis~fo much J;efembled the long tails
of comets, that at firfi fight they 1night \vell be· taken for 'fuch: this
light feeq1s to have a great affinity to -th:at which the effluvia of electric.
bodies emit in the dark. '
M. Fatio has fuggefied, that fome of the comets have their-nodes fo
very near the annual orbit of the earth, that, if the earth ihould .hap-
pen to be found in that part next the node, at the time of a comet's paffing

gi,·cn: \Vhcncc iuch tranfits of con1cts \viii afford the bcfl: means of dc-
tennin ing the di!l:ancc of the Earth at1d Sun.
The comet of I -472 had a parallax above t\\'enty times grcntcr than
the Sun's: and, if that of 16t 8 hnd co1nc do\vn in the beginning of ~larch
to its dcfccnding node, it \vould have 'been much nearer to Earth, and '
its.para11ax tnuch n1ore notable. But, hitherto, none has threatened the
earth \vith a nearer appu]fe than that of 168o: for,. by calculation, Dr.
Halley finds, that, November 11th, I h. 6 min. P. M. that comet \vas
not above one '(etnidiamctcr of the earth to the north\vard of the \vay of
the earth; at \Vhich time, ·hag the earth been in that part of its orbit,

their falls acquire fuch a velocity, as that they may again run oft- into the
remotefl: regions: ftill1noving up\vards \\'ith fuch a perpetual tendency
as never to return. But the.frequency of their appearance, and their de-
gree of velocity, \vhich does not exceed \vhat they might acquire by their
gravity tO\\'ards the Sun·, feems to put it p_
afi doubt that they move, planet-
like, in elliptic orbits, though exceedingly eccentric ; and fo return
again, after very long periods. The apparent velocity of the comet of
I 4 i2_, as obferved by Regiomontanus, \Vas fuch as to carry it through
forty degrees of a great circle in twenty-four hours: and that of I 770
was obferved to move through more than forty-five degree in the lafi:

AN ILLUST. RATION
thefe which follow: 1. In cop_
fidering the courfe of the cotnets, with
reo-ard to' the fixed fiars, they are found 'to keep a confiderable time in
th~ arch of a great circle, i. e. a -
circle ''vhofe plane palfes through ./the
centre ofthe earth: indeed, they deviate a little fro1n it, chiefly tO\Vards
the end of their ,appearance; ·but this d~v.iation is common to them .,vith
the planets. 2. ·comets, as well as planets, appear to move fo much the
· fafier as they are nearer the earth; and, wh~n they are at e·qual -difiances
from their perigee, their velocities are·nearly the fame.
By fubtraCl:ing from their motion the apparent inequality of velocity
occafioned by their different difrances ~rom the earth, their equal motion
might be found ;..but we.fhould not be certain tqis motion were t.heir.true
one; becaufe they might have,confiderable inequalities, not difiinguilh-
able in that fmall part of their orbit vifible to us. I~ is, indeed, probable
their real ·motion, as well as that of the p~anets, is un~ual in itfelf:
and hence we have a reafon "vhy the obfervations made during the ap-
pearance of a comet cannot give,the~ull: period of their revolution•
.
· There are no t\vo different ·planets whofe orbit,s cut the ecliptic in' the
fame a~1gle, whofe n~des are in t_
he fam~ points·of the ecliptic,' and \Vhofe
apparent velocity in their·perigee _i~ 4:he fame: confequently, two comets
feen at djfferent times, ·yet agreeing· with all thofe three circumftances,
c;;tn orily be .one and the fame comet. And this.\vere the comets of 1577
and 1.68o obferved to do, and thofe of ~ 652 and I 698; not that this ex-
act ' agreetnent, iil thefe circutnftances, is abfol~tely necelfary to deter~
mine them the fame comet. M. Caffini finds the Moon herfelf irregular
in· them all: acco~·dingly, he is of opinion, there are feveral \vhich difa...
gree ~herein, and yet may be a~counted the fame.
The great ohje,B:i0n againfl: the return of comets, is, the rarity of their
appearance, with:regard ·to ·the nuiJ?.her of revolutions affigned to them.
In I 702, there was a comet, or rather the tail of one, feen at Rome,
·which M, Caffini takes to be .the fame with that obferved by Arifiotle,
and that fince fe.eu in r'668~ which \v.ould imply its period to ·be thirty-
four years. Now it may feem ftrange, that a fiar 'vhich has fo lhort are-
volution, and of confeqttence fuch freguent returns, ihould be [o feldom
feen.-.t}gain, in April, of the f~me year, 1 i0.2., a comet was pbferved by.

that ~f 1 664, both by reafon of its motion, velocity, and direction. M. de.
{a Hire took it·to have fame relation to another he had obferved in 1698,
which M. Cafi1ni refers to that of I 652. On this .fuppofition, its period

\vithout fl:raining, or allo\viug 1nauy irrcguJaritics.
l\1. de la Hire propofes one general ~Hfficulty againfi. the 'vhole fyftctn
of the return of comets, \vhich \vould ieetn to hinder any comet fro.m be-
ing a planet: and it is this ; that, by the difi)ofition.ucceffarily given to
their courfcs, they ought to appear as large at firfl: as at lafi ; and ahvays
incrcafe, till they arrive at their greatefr proximity to the earth : or, jf
they ihould, chance not to be obfervcd, as foon as they become vifible, for
\Vnnt of attention thet:'eto, at leafi it is in~poffible but they mufr frequently
1he\v thcn1felves before •they have arrived a·t their full magnitude and
brightncfs. But he' adds, that none \vere ever yet obfcrved till they had
arrived at it. Yet the appearance of a comet in the month of O Ctober
1 723, \Vhile at a great diftance, (o as to be too finall and din1 to be
vie\ved \Vithout a telefcope, n1ay ferve to remove this obftacle, and fet
the comets, ftil1, on the iame footing \Vith the planets. Sir l faac N ew-
ton fuppofes, that as thofc planets \vhich are nearefr the Sun, and revolve
in the leafi orbits, are the finnllefr; fo, among the cotnets, fuch as in
their perihelion come nearefi: the Sun are the fmalleft, and revolve in
fmaller orbits•

Dr. Halley has given us a table of the aftronotnical elements of all the
comets that have be<:n yet obferved \Vith due care; \vhereby, \Vhenever a

foretold. This table conta~ns the aftronomical elements of t\\'enty-four
comets, on the fuppofiti~n that they moved in parabolas; though he
thought it extretnely probable that they rea1ly moved in very eccetitric
ellipfes, and confcquently _

rrhere are many things in the comet of I 532, obferved by Peter Appian,
,\,hich intimate its being the fame \Vith that of 16o7, obferved by Kepler
and Longorpontanus; and \vhich Dr. ,Halley himtelf again. obferved in
I 68 2. i\.11 the e'lerncnts agree, and there is nothing COntradiCts the opinion
but that inequality in the periodic revolution, \vhich. ho\vever he thinks is
no more than may be ~ccouuted for from phyfical caufes: no more in effect
than is obferved in Saturn; the r:1otion of vvhic~ planet .is fo dill:urbed by
the reft, efpecia.Hy Jupiter, that its period is uncet=tain for feveral days to..
gether: to \Vhat errors thcu may not a comet be liable, \vhich rifcs to al- '
moll: four titnes t9c height of the planet Saturn; ar1d \vhofc ·velocity,. if
but a little increafed, would change its elliptic orb into a parabolic one?

vVbat farther confirms tbe ideritity~ is the appearance of auother con1et
... in the futnmer ~o( 1456, \vhich;; th.ough obferved by n_
one 'vith accuracy,
yet, by -its 'period and the manner of its tranfit, he concludes to be the
fame; a1id thence veutured to foretel its return -
in the year 1 7g8~ or·the
. beginning 9f the ·next year: and titne has verified the· prediCl:ion. It ap-
peared in ·
iv1arch I 759· Halley alia thought that the ~omet of 1.68o .\VU3
the £11ne that ·\Vas obferved in r 1o6, 531 ,. and in the forty-fourth year
before Chrift, .\V hen J ulius C~far was murdered; and that its period was
five_hundred and feventy-five. years. Mr. ·Dunthorne, ·in:- the .Philoiophi-
cal Tranfactioi1s, -vol. xlvii. has endeavqured to ihe\V, from a MS. iu
Pembroke-hall I..,ibrary, that the comet .of 1 1o6 could not be the fatne.
\vith that of I 68o. , But M. de. ]a Lande adopts the opinion of Dr.
Halley.
- To detertnine the place-and courfe of a comet., obfet7Ve the diftance of
the cotnet from t\¥9 fixed fiars \Vhofe·Iongitudes and latitudes a·re kno\vn: _
from__ the-diftances .thus found~ ca~cnlate tne place of the comet by trigo-
.nometry.; ,and, by repeating the ~bfervatio~1s a.nd operations for fev~rat
days fu.cceffively, the courfe of the co1net \Vill be had. 'vVe might alfo
determ-ine the courf~ of a comet mechanically, \vithout any apparatus of
inftruments, by the following ingenious tnethod, \vith a thread, \vhich.
we o\ve to Longomontanus. ·Obferve four fiars round the co~ct, fuch
as that'the comet .1nay be in the interfeftion of.the right lines that join
the t\-vo oppofite frars; \vhich is eafily found by means ofa thread p·laced
before t.he eye, an(! extended.over-againft the ftars and comets. Find thefe
four ftars upon a globe, and extend · two threads ~rofs\vays, frotn one
.corner to the other of the fquare fpace defcribed by the four ftars, and the
central point where the threads interfeCl-each ·other will give the plac~ of
the comet. This practice being repeated for feveral days, the con1et's
courfe \vill be had on the globe; vvhich courfe will be found to be a great
circle, .from any t\vo points whereof it will be eafy to find its inclination
to the ecliptiC,· and the place of the ,nodes, only by obferving \Vhere a
thread, ftretched through the two -
points, cuts the ecliptic.
.
Such is' the.do.c1:rine of comets, as lai~ down frotn titne t0 time both by
the ancient and modern philofophers:. but which, like tnofr othei· abfl:rufe
phenomena, is founded pretty much upon conjeCture and arbitrary concep--
tion. Should the cotnets of I 264 and 15s6 (\\·hich are fuppofed to be the
fame) appear in or about the year I 848, it will confirm a great ·deal of
the foregoing fpeculation, as to t___heir poifeiling a determinate place in the

eccentric, arc nevcrthclefs definable, and fuch as may hereafter throw
great light upon philofophical di!quifitions.
Dr. IIallcy coujecrurcd, that tbc comet obicrvcd by Apian in 1532, \vas
the fame as that obferved·by £-levelius in i 66r ; if fo, it ought to have re-
turned in ri90, but it has 11cver been obfervecl. But M. 1\fechain having
colle8:ed all the obfervatious in 1522, and calculated the orbit again, found
it to be fcnfibly different from that determined by Dr. Halley, \vhich ren-
ders it very doubtful \vhether this \vas the comet ~~hich appeared in I 661;
aud this doubt is increafed by its not appearing in 1790. The comet in

Of E C L I P S E S•.
An Eclipfe, from EV.r,~•;, of eV.ti'7To, to fail, fignifies a failure or priva-
tion of the light of one of the luminaries, by the interpofition of fome
dark or opaque body falling bet\-vcen it and the eye, or bet\veen it and·
the Sun. The Moon, being a dark and opaque body, receives her light
from the ,Sun by refleCtion; which is proved by her incrcafing and de-
creafing in' light as ihe is'nearer or farther offfrom her conj~I}Cl:ions \vith
the Sun. _At the ecliptical conjunCtion, ,or new l\1oon, the Jark body
of the Moon paffes direCtly between the Sun and us, \Yhich hides that:
luminary from our (Ight, and this conftitutes an eclipfe'"of the Sun; but
at an ecliptical oppofition, o'r full Moon, the Sttn, the Earth, and the ·
Moon, are in one direCl: and diametrical line; the <lark globe of the
Earth, being then bet\veen the Sttn and l\1oon, deprives the Moon of·
the Sun's ltght, vvhereby '!he becomes darkened an-
d eclipfed, having no .
light of her O\vn. The line· or. \Vay \Vherein the Moon makes her con-
ftant periodical revolutions croffes the ecliptic ,yherein the Sun tnoves..
at an angle of about five degrees; the diftance of thefe lines confi:itutes
the Moon's latitude; and the places in the ecliptic \Vhich thefe lines in-
terfeCl: arc called the Moon's nodes, or the Dragon's Head and Drag~n's·
Tail. Thefe interfecrions do not ahvays happen it~ one place of the.
3cliptic, but move once through the fame, contrary to the fequel or fuc- .
ccffion of the· figns, in eighteen years and two hundred and t\venty-..
five days.
If the Moon at full be difiant from· the·Dragon's Head or ·Tail 1norc :
than fifteen degrees, there can be no eclipfe of the l\foon; and, \Vhen at ·
the time of the change the Moon is n1ore than.nineteen.degrees difiant·

Eclipfes of the Sun ar.e vari'ou's both in quantity and quality, ·being
beheld from different parts of the earth; \vhere he ~vill appe.ar partially
eclipfed t9 a fpetlator on the north fide of his body, and tota11y to a '·
. fpe~atol" on his fouth,fide; whilft to others he will appear a~ ~he fame
inftant not at all eclipfed. The reafon is, the Sun in his ecllpfes is not
darkened; but only hidden from our fight by the interpofition of the Moon,
"vhofe various parallaxes produce this diverfity in the Sun's eclipfe.

..·T~e eclipfe of the Moon, on the contr'!-ry, appears the fa.me to all parts
of 'the earth, and to all people -above whofe horizon fhe is at that titne
elevated; for, w~en lhe is deprived of the 'light of the Sun, ihe becomes
really d'arkened. To efiimate the quantjtics of the eclipfes of either lu-
minary, their diameters are fuppofedly divided iilto t\velve equal parts,
called digits, becaufe, th;eir diameters appear to fight about a foot in
length ; to that, when the N1oon obfcures half the Sun's diameter, he is

Amotigfl: the creleilial phenomena, the doB:rine of eclipfes .takes pre.- .
cedency; becaufe from their obfervations the primary founda,ti<;>n of
the \Vhole body of afiron6~y is demonfirated and confirmed. Hence the
folar eclipfes 1nanifefi th~ l\1oon to be· Io\ver and lefs than the Sun; . the
lunar eclipfes prove_ that the earth is liot founded infinitely bel<?\V ·us,
but that ~he heavens under us are difiant from the earth as far _upwards, _
in .refpeB: qf our antipodes, as they are here; and confequently that t_
he
E~r.th is not cubical, pyratnidal, nor cylindrical, but on ·every fide per-
fe.crfy _round, or ter,minated· by a globular figure;. not only becaufe t~e
fhadow of the Earth in the Moon's body·~s ahvays and on every part obfer-
ved. to' be 'round, but alfo becaufe thofe who live eaftvvard number·more
hours from their ~eridian,~ for the beginning or-ending of an~y eciipfe,

~in~ting in a .fJlarp 'point'; arid the fame place of the Moon's tranfits to

The true and certain place of the Moon cannot be had by any infiru-
n1ent \vhatioever, bccauic of her parallaxes. Nature, or ra..ther..thc Cod
. of 1
1
lature, hath therefore fupplied this defeB: by her eclipfes; ·for the
l\1oou pofited in 1nedii.r tellebris is then underfto~d to be oppofitc to the Sun,.
by vvhich means the motions and mutations of the l\1oon are found out
and rationally demonfirated. And, as by lunar eclipfes \Ve gather, that
the Su1i is far greater than the Earth, and the Moon lefs, fo by folar
eclipfes \Ve demonftrate th~ difrance of the luminaries from the Earth to
be different, and to be moved in eccentrics or epicycles; \vhence a rule
is fouri~ for meafur.ing the difiancc of the Sun and Moon from the Earth,
together with the rnagnitudes of the feveral celefiial bodies.
Eclipfes of the I\1Qon only happen in the tin1~of full ivioon; becaufe
it is on]y then the Earth is bet\Veen the- Sun and rvroon : nor do they hap-
pen every full Moon, by reafon of the obliquity·of the Moon's \vay \vitb
refpeB: to the Sun's; but only in thofe full ~1oons v.rhich happen either
in the uodes, or very near the1n, \Vhere the aggregate of the apparent fe-
tnidiameters of the Moon and the Earth's fhado\v is gr~ater tha,n the lati-
tude of the Moon, or the difian<;e bet\veen their centres. -
The xnoft confiderable circumfi:ances in the eclipfes of the Moon are,
'rhat, as the futn of the fetnidiameters of the Moon and Earth's ihado\ll
is greater than the aggregate of the femidiameters of the Sun and l\'loon,
. (that, \Vhen Jeafi:, being Sf; and this, \Vhen greateft, fcarcely 3};) it is
evident, lunar eclipfes may happen in a greater latitude of the l\1oon and
at a greater difl:auce from the nodes, and con(equently, are more often
obferved, in any one part of the Earth, than folar ones;. though, \vith
refpeet to the 'vhole Earth, the latter are more fr~quent tha~ the fanner,
becaufe the Sun"s e~liptic limits are greater than the 1\1oort's•
.
Total eclipfes of the Moon, and thofe of the longeft duration,' hap-
pen'in the very nodes of the ecliptic; becaufe the fectiou of ·the Earth's

There may.likewife be totol eclipies vvi~hin ~ little difiance of the nodes;
·but, the farther, the lefs their duration; farther off frill, there are only
partial ones, and at le1igth none at .all, as the latitude and 'the feinidia-
meter of the .Moon, ·together, are .either lefs, eqlial to, or greater, than the
femidiametet of the fhado\v, A lunar eclipfe, that is both total and

though a~ firft, the Moon be more \vefterly than the Earth's lhadow,
,yet, her proper motion being f~rifter than the h1.me, ihe overtakes and
o.utgoes 'it; .The Moon even in the middle of' an eclipfe, has uf~ally a
faint appearance of light refembling tarnilhed copper; yvhich Gaifendus~

Sol~r eclipfes, being an occultation of the Sun;s body occafioned by
an interpofition of the Moon between the Sun and the Earth, are diftin-
guifhed, like thofe of the Moon, ~nto total and partial, &c. to "'hich muft
be added a third fpec~es, .called annular.. As the Moon is fo"~nd to have a.
parallax of latitude, eclipfes of the .Sun only happen when the latitude of
the Moon, viewed from the· Earth, is lefs than 'the a·ggregate of the appa-
rent femidiameters of the Sun and Moon. Solar eclipfes therefore only
happen ·\V hen the Moon is in ·conjunCtion with tJle Sun, in or near the·
nodes~ i. e. at the lle\v moons. Confequently, the tne1norable eclipfe
of the Sun, at our Saviour's paffion,--h.appeJ1ing a't the time of full moon,
when the $un aQd Moon are in oppofition, \Vas preterna~ural. Befides
the darknefs in total eclipfes of the Sun never lafrs above four minutes in
one place; . wherea~ the darknefs at the crucifixion lafied three hours,
(Matthew xxvii~ 45·) and overfpread at leaft all the land of Judea.
·.
· But though the New ¥oon pafs between the Sun and the Ea~th, yet is
not there an eclipfe every Moon'; becaufe the Moon's way is not pre-
eifely u.nder the ecliptic, but is place~ obliquely t~ereto, interfecting it
twice in every period. So that eclipfes can only be occafioned in fuch
1'{ew Moons as happen in thefe ir:tterfeCl:ions or nodes, or very near them.

in one place it is total, in another it is only partial. Ana farther, that
the Moon, ~vhen, in her apogee, appears much lefs·than the Sun, as hap·
pens- mofr fenfibly vvheu ·he is in perigreo; the cufp of the lunar fhado\V
uot then reaching the Earth, fhe becomes in a central conjun&ion
\vith the Sun, yet not able to cover his difk, but· let3 his \Vhole limb

'vhich does not happen at the fame time in all places \Vhere it is ·fcen;
bu~ appears more early to the wefi:ern parts, and later to the caficrn, as
\\,.ill hereafter be further explained.
.
In tnofr folar eclipfes, the Moon's difK is covered \\'ith a faint da,vning
light; \vhich is attributed to the refleftion of the light from the illumi-
nated part of the Earth. In total eclipfes of the Sun, the 1v1oon's limb
is feen furrounded by a pale circle of light; \Vbich fomc aftronomers take

the atmofphere of the Sun; becaufe it has been obferved to move equally
\vith the Sun, and not with the Moon; and befides, th'e Moon is nO\V'

the apparent magnitude or difk of the Sun is. nearly the fam~ '"'ith that

What has hitherto been faid regards the phenome11a of an eclipfe of
the ·Sun, as ·they appear to a fpecrator on the Earth's furface, in whofe
zenith the·!v.loon then is, and \Vhere there is no refratl:ion to alter the true
latitude of the Moon: but, when the l\1oon has any latitude, there the
procefs of .ca1cillating the appearances of a folar eclipfe \vill be fomewhat
more cotnplex, on. ac<;ount of the V'!riation of the Moon's latitude and
longitude for every different altitude, and confequently for every momept .
ofthe eclipfe. ·..
..
.... .
The#beft way of reprefenting a folar eclipfe, is by a projeCtion of the
earth's difk and of the feClion of the dark and penumbral fhadows as
they appear,· or,would appear, to a fj>ectator at the difiance of the Moon
in a right line joining the cent~es of tn~ Sun and the Earth. Jn order to
this., we are to £nd the dimenfions of the apparent ~emi-diameters of the ,
earth, dark'ihadow, and penumbra, at the diftance of the Moon. As to
the firfi, viz. the ·Earth's femi-diameter, it is equal to the Moon's hori-
zontal parallax. That of the dark ihadow is thus efiimated: Let C in
fig. 5, be the cen~er of the Moon, D B its diatneter, D H B its dark
iliadow, and K. A L the penumbral cone. Then let E F be the dia- ·
rueter of the penu1nbra at the earth, and I G that of the -
dark fhadow,
·and draw C G and C E; then is the angle C G 'B=B H C+G C H,
and I fo G .C H::;=B G C-B II c; that is, the ·apparent felni-diat:neter
of the dark fbadow is equal to the difference between the apparent
fetni:..diameters of the Sun and Moon. And in like manner the angle
E·c H ==== D E C+D A C; that is,. the apparent fetni-diatneter of the ·
penumbra, at the Earth, is equal to the fum of the apparent femi-
diatneters of the Moon , and Sun.' Now the femi-diameter of the Sun
and Moon, and alfo the Moon's horizontal parallax·, are already calcu-. ·
lated for their various diftances from the Earth ; and for the leaft, mean~ ,

that if the Moon, \vhen ne,v, be at the difiance Q G from the node, the

node, and begin to come in at the fouth poie of the Earth, 'vill go a lit-
tle northerly at each return, till at lafi: they.quite leave the Earth at the
north pole.
;
.
To exemplify this matter, it may not here be amifs to examine fame
of the mofi: ~ remarkable circumfiance5 of the return of an eclip(e men-
·tl9ned in Mr. Smith's ingenious Diifertation, \vhich happened July 14-t
I 748, about noon. This eclipfe, after traverfing the voids of.fpace frotn
the creation, at Iall: began to enter the Terra Aujiralis Incognita about
eighty-eight years after the Conquefr, which was the lafi of King Ste...
phen's reign ; every Chaldean period, namely, 1 8 years 1 1 days ,7 hours
43 minutes 20 feconds, as above-~entioned, it has confrantly crept more
northerly, but \Vas frill invifible in· Britain before the year I 622, ~·hea
on the 3oth of April it began to touch tbe fouth parts of England about
t\vo in the afternoon; its centrala:ppearance rifing in the American South
Seas, and traverfing Peru and th~ Amazons country, through the Atlant~c
ocean into Africa, and fetting ·in the Ethiopian continent, not far from
the beginning of the Red Sea.
•
Its next vifible period was after three Chaldean revolutions, in 1676,
on the firfi: o_f June, riling·central in the Atlantic ocean, palling us about
nine in the morning, 'vith four digits eclipfed on the under limb; and
fetting in the gulph of Cochin China in the ~afr Indies.
'
It being now near the folftice, this eclipfe -""'as vifible the very next
return in 1694, in the evening; and in two periods tnore, \V hich was in
1730, ou the 4th of July, \Vas feen above half eclipfed juft after fun-rife,
and obferved both at Wirtemberg in Germany an~ Pekin in China, foon
after \vhich it \Vent off. Eighteen years .more afforded us this eclipfe
again, \vhich happened the I 4th of July, 1748. The next vifible return
happened 011 the 25th of July, I 762, in the evening, ab9ut four digits
eclipfed; and, after two. periods more, it was vifible again, on ·the 16th
of·Augufi:, t8oz,. early in the morning, about five digits, the centre cotn-
ing from tbe north frozen continent, by the capes of Norway, through
Tartary, China, and Ja-
pan, to the Ladrone Iflands, where it went off•
..Again, in I 82o, Augufi 26, bet\vixt one and two, there \:viJl be ano-
ther return of this eclipfe at London about 1o digits; but happening fo
near the equinox, the centre will leave every part of Britain to the weft,
enter
OJ! ASTROLOGY.
enter G'cnnar~y at Embden, palling by Venice, Naples, and Gr:-tntl Cairo,
and fct in the gulph of llaffora near that city. It \Vill be no more vifible
till 1874, \vheu five digits \vill be obfcured (the centre being nov1 about
to leave the Earth) on September 28. In 1892 the Sun \vill go do\Vn
cclipicd at London, and again in I 928 the palTagc of the centre will be in
the e:t•pan.fiun, tnough there \vill be t\vo digits eclipfed at London, Otlober
the 31ft of that year; and about the year 2090 the \vholc penumbra \vjll
be \Vorn off; whence no more returns of this. eclipfc can·happen till after
a revolution of tcu thouf:1nd years.
Fro1n thefc remarks on the entire revolution of this eclipfc, \Ve may .
gather, that a theuC1.nd years, more or lcfs, (for there are fome irregulari- .
ties that may protraC1 or lengthen this period roo years,) complete the
whole terrell:rial phenomena of any fingle eclipfe: and fince 20 periods of
54 years each, and about 33 days, comprehend the entire extent of their
revolution, it is evident that the times of the returns will pafs through a
circuit of one year and ten n1onths, every Chaldean period..being ten or
eleven days later, and of the equable appearances about 32 or 33 days.
Thus, though this eclipfe happens about the middle of July, no other
fubfequent eclip!e of this period \\'ill return to the middle of the fame
month again; but' wear confiantly each period ten or eleven days for-
ward, and at laft appear in winter; but then it begins to ceafc from af-
feCting us.
Another conc]ufion from this revolution may be dra\vn, that there will
feldom be any more than t\vo great eclipfes. of the Sun in the interval of
this period, and thefe follo\v fometimes next return, and often at greater
difiances. That of 1 71 5 returned· again in 1 733 very great ; but this
prefent eclipfe will not be great till the arrival of I 820, 'vhich is a re-
volution of four Chaldean periods: fo that the regulations of their cir-
cuits mufi: ·undergo new cosnputations to affign them exactly.
Nor do all eclipfes come in at the fouth pole: that depends altogether
on the pofition _of the lunar nodes, which \viii bring in as many from the
~J..~panfutll one \vay as the other: and fuch. ec]ipfes \vill wear more foutherly
by degrees, cont;ary to what happens in the p_refent cafe.
The eclipfe, for example, of 1736, in September, had its centre in the
expanfittn, and· fet about the n1 iddle of its obfcurity in }3ritain; it \vill \vear
in. at the north pole, and in the year 26oo, or thereabouts, go off in the
eJ:panfunJ on the fouth fide of the Earth.

l<!tus in Afin, 'Nhcre Thalc.s then refidcd. That year correfponds to the
585th year before Chrifi; '''hen accordingly there happened a very fignal
cclipfc of the Sun, on the z8th of May, ani\vcring to the prcfci1t 1cd'i of
that 1nonth,* central through North 1\mcrica, the fouth part~ of France,
lta1y, &c. as far as Athens, or the 10es in the ..t'J~gean Sea; \vhich is the
f:'lrthefl: that even the Caroline Tables carry it; and confequcntly rnake
it invifible to any part of Afta, in the total charatler; though I have good
rcnfons to btJieve that it extended to Babvlon, and went clovvn central
~
over that city. vVc are not ho\vcver to imagine, that it \Vas fet before it
pa!fed Sardis and the Afiatic to,vns, where the predictor lived; becaufe
an invifible eclipfe could have been of no fervice to demonfirate bis ability
in afironomical fciences to his countrymen, as it could give no proof of
its reality.
For a farther illufi.ration, Thucydides relates, that a folar eclipfe hap-
pened on a futntner's day in the afternoon, in the firfl: year of the Pelo-
ponnefian 1\.var, fo great that the fiars appeared. Rhodius \Vas \'iClor in
the Olympic games the fourth year of the £1id \Var, being alfo th~ fourth
of the 87th Olympiad, on the 428th year before Chrift. So that the
eclipfe tnufr have happened in the 431 fr year before Chrifi; and by com-
putation it appears, that on the 3d of .t\ugt1ft there \Vas l fignal eclipfe
\vhich \vould have paifed over Athens central about fix in the evening,
but \vhich our prefent Tables bei11g no farther than the ancient Syrtes on
the African-co~fi, above 400 miles from Athens; vrhich, fuffcring in that
cafe but 9 digits, could by no means exhibit the. retnarkable darknc1s re-
cited by this hifiorian; the centre therefore feems to have pa!fed Athens
ab9ut fix in the evening, and probably p1ight go do\Vn about Jernfalcm,
or near it, contrary to the confiruB:ion of the preient Tables. 1 have
only n1entioned thcfe things by way of caution to the prefent afironotners,
111 rc-corn!)uti_ng ancient eclipfes; and refer them to cxa1nine the eclipfe
• . The reader may probably find it difficult to uoderfiand why Mr. Smith lhould reckon this
rdipfe to have been in the -+th year of the •8th Ol!fmp1ad, HS it was onJy in the end of the third
year: aml alfo why the 2ith of l\1ay, in the 5~5th y~ar before Chrift, thou1d anfwer to the prcfent
1oth of that month. But we hope the fullowing explan:ltion will remove thefe difficulties. Tho
month of May (when the Sun was eclipfed) in the sSsth year before the firfi year of Chritl, which
was a leap-year, fell in the Ja~ter end of the third year of the +Slh Olympaid; and the fourth year
of that Olympiad began at the fummer foHl:ice following; but perhaps Mr. Sn1ith begin~ the
years of the Olympiad from January, in order to make them correfpood more readily with Julian
years; nnd fo reckons the month of May, when the cclipfe happened, to be in the fourth year
of that Olympiad. 'rhe place or longitude of the Sun at that time was g :g degrees 43 miuutc:s

In Afironomy, eclipfes of the Moon are of great ~fe for afcertaining
th~ periods of her motions, efpecially fuch eclipfes· as are obferved to be
alike in all circutnftances, and have long intervals of time between them.
In Geog;raphy, the longitudes of places are found by eclipies, as alrea-
dy
fhewn ; but for this purpofe eclipfes of the· Moon are more ufeful than
thofe of the Sun, becaufe they are more frequently vifible, and the fame
lunar eclipfe is ofequal largenefs and duration at all places where it is feen.
In Chronology, both folar C!nd lunar eclipfes ferve to detennine exacrly

"in every eclipfe \vith rcfpca to its quantity, the places \Vhcrc it is vitibJe
(if of the Sun), and the time of the day or night ; that it is itnpoffiblc
there can be t\vo folar cclipfcs in the courfc of n1a-ny ages \vhich arc alike
an all circumfianccs.
O'f the FIGURE and l\10TION of the EARTI-I, the CliANCil~ of
SEASONS, the CAUSE of EARTHQUi\KES, &c.
'l..hc Earth, among Afironomers, is confidered as one of the primary
p1anets; and its figure \Vas accounted by fotne of the ancients to be like
that of an oblong cylinder; by others, of the fonn of a clrurn, and by
others to be flat. :But the moderns have demonftratcd it to be nearly
fpherical, or rather an oblate fpheroid, flatted to\vards the pole••.
Before we enter more minutely into thefe [peculations, it \Vi 11 he pro-
pt!r to defcribe the various circles of the globe, and to explain its feveral
divifions and boundaries, as \Vell imaginary as real~ in order to give all
my readers a perfeCt idea of the fubjett before them. For this purpofe l
nave fubjoined a plate of the Armillary Sphere, \vhich is an artificial con-
trivance, reprefenting the feveral circles proper to the theory of the
tnundane '"'orld, put together in their natural order, to eafe and affifi:
the i1nagination in conceiving the conftitution of the fphercs, aud the va-
rious phenomena of the celcfiial bodies. For this purpofe the Earth is
placed in the centre, pierced by a line fuppofed to be its axis, the
upper point of \V hich is fixed in the ar~ic, or north pole, and the lo\ver
extremity in the antarCtic, or fouth pole; \Vhence the two fi11all circles
defcribed near thefe points are called the arctic and antarCtic circles.
The outer circle, in \vhich the axis or poles of the \Vorld are fixed,
reprefents the n1eridian, or fuppofed line over any given place, to \vhich
\vhen the Sun comes, it is then rnid-day, or noon. The broad circle,
\vhich crolfes the \Vhole, and divides the fphere into t\VO equal parts, is
caHed the horizon; becaufe it divides the heavens and the earth into t\vo
equal parts or hemifpheres, called the upper and the )o\ver, the one light
and the other dark. It like\vifc detennines the rifing and fetting of the
Sun, lVIoon, or fiars, in any particular latitude; for, \Vhen any of thcfe
appear jufi at the eafiern part of the horizon, \Ve fay, it rifes; and, \vhen
it does to at the \'lefl:ern part, \Ve iay, it !ets. From hence aHa the lati-
tude of the Sun and fiars is reckoned, \vhich is their height above the
horizon. The poles of the horizon are the zenith and the nadir, or the
points immediately over our heads and under our feet, dian1etrically
oppofitc to each other, in the upper and lotvcr hemifphercs. The inner

wide circle reprefents the zodiac, the middle line of \vhich is the ecliptic~
or Sun's \\'ay in the zodiac, from \vhich he never departs. It is not fo
'vith the Moon and the planets; for, though their confiant '\'ay is in this
circle of the zodiac, yet they continually deviate- from its centre, or
i ecliptic line, frotn horth to fouth) and from fouth to north; which
Jeviations are called their latitudes, and their extent each \vay deter-
tn1nes the \vidth of the zodiac.. Tl)e two circl~s within the zodiac,.
\vhich interfeB: each other at right angles, confiitute t~e equin'oetial co-
hire, and the equator, or equinoCtial line. The points where tbefe cir-
cles·interfetl: each other, divide the quarters in the y~ar. That \vhich
paffes ' through the two equinoxial points, detennines the equinoxes;
and that \Vhich pafies through the poles of the ecliptic, determines the ,
folfiices. When the Sun -is in the fidl of them, viz. in the fpring, March
2oth, it is called the vernal equinox; · and when in autumn, Septetnber
23d, it is- called the aututnnal equinox; at both 'vhich times, it is equal
day ~nd night all-over the world. So like\vife, \Vhen the Sun is in the other,
and at his greateft afcent above the equator, and ieen1s_ to defcribe the
tropic of Cancer, it is called the fummer folftice, and n1akes the longeft
day; and on the contrary, 'vhen he is at the greateft defcei1t belov'v- the
equator, and feems to defcribe the tropic of Capricorn, it is called the
\vi.nter foHl:ice, or fhortefr day. Thefe tropics are t\vo circles defcribed
one imn1ediately under and next adjoining to the a1·Clic circle; and the ,
other, that nex~ above the autartric circle. They are difiant frotn the
equinoCtial t\Venty-three degrees tvventy-nine mi_nutes. That oq the
north fide of the.line is called the tropic of Cance~, and the fouthern
tropic has the name ·of Capricorn, as paffing through the beginning of ·
each of tho{e figns.
. .
It muft here likewife be noted, that the Equator, or Equinoctial Line,
paffes throl1gh the eafi and \vefi points of t-he horizon, and at the meri-
dian is raifed as much above the horizon as is the completnent of the
Jatituqe _
of the place. From this circle, the latitude of places, w~et.her
north or fouth, begin to be reckoned in degrees of the meridian; but
the~ longitude of places are reckoned in degrees of the equator itfelf. AJl
people living on or under this circle, which is ca!led by geographers and
navigators the Lint?, have their days and nights confiantly equal: and
this is the reafon \V hy, when tbe Sun .enters t\vo points where the
ecliptic interfeets the equinoB:ia1, and is exactly upon this line, natnely,
in the fpring and autumn, as aboveotnentioned, that the days and nights .
beco.me of equal duration all over the globe. All the ftars direCtly under
this circle have no declination, but always rife due eafr, and fet full weft.
The 'hour circles are dra\Yn at right angles to it, paffing through every

Having prc1niicd to lnuch by \\'ay of explaining the fphcre, 1 thall uo\v
proceed \\'ith the fubject inHnediately before us.
1"hnt the l~arth is n fj>het ical body, mny be dcmonfrratcd from the
follo\v ing atnong other confiderations. J. All the appearances of the
hcnvcns, both at laud and at fca, arc the fi1me as they \VOttld bejf the Earth
"'.'ere a globe. 2. In cclipfes of the IVIoon \vhich ar·c caufed by the fha-
do\\' of the l~arth falling upon the l\1oon, this thado\v is ahvays circular,
and a body can be no other than a globle, \vhich in all fituations cafis a
circular 1hado\v. 3· Several navigators have failed quire round the globe,
fteering their cour{e dirctl:ly fouth and \Vefr, till they came to the ~1a­
gellanic Sea, and from thence to the north and \Vcfi, till they returned
to their port from the eafi; and all the phenomena \vhich lhould natu-
rally ari{e fron1 the Earth's rotundity happened to them. Befides, their
method of failing 'vas alfo founded upon this hypothefis, \Vhich could
never have fuccecded fo happ'ily, ifthe Earth had been ofany other figure.
It is true, the furface of the Earth is not an exatl: geometrical globe, but
then the inequalities are fo inconfiderable, that the highcfl: Jnountain
bears no greater proportion to the bulk of the Earth than a grain of duct
does to a comtnon globe. The figure of the Earth then \Vas reckoned by
- mathematicians and geographers as perfectly fpherical, excepting the fn1all
iaequalities in its furface, of n1ountains and valleys, till an accident en-
gaged the attention of Sir Ifaac Newton, and ~1r. Huygens, \vho de-
monfirated, from the la\vs of hyd.rofiatics, and the revolution of the Earth
about its axis, that its figure -\vas not a true fphere,. but an oblate fphe-
roid flatted to\vards the poles. 1v1onfieur Richer, )V hen at the iOand of
Cayenne, about five degrees difiant from the equator, found that his clock,
\Vhich at Paris k·ept true time, no\v lofr t\\'0 minutes and t\Venty-eight
fecon~s every ·day. N O\V, though heat \Vill leugthen pendulums, and
confeq\lently retard th~ir motion, it is certain the heats of CaJenne \Vere
n~t fufficient to folve this phrenomenon, \:vhich can flovv only from a di-
minution in the pre1fure of gravity. For, as the Earth revolves about
its axis, all its parts \vill endeavour to recede from the axis of motion, and
thereby the equatoreai parts \V here the motion is quickefi: \Vill tend lets
towards the centre than the refi; their endeavour to fly ofl; from the axis
about \vhich they.revolve taking ofr.. part of their tendency that \vay;
fo that thofe parts \vill become lighter than fuch as are nearer the poles.
The polar parts, therefo1 e will prefs in to\vards· the centre, and raife
the equatoreal parts, till the quantity of Jnatter in the latter is fo far in-
creafed as to cotnpeui:'lte for its lightneCs, and an equilibriutn be rell:ored.
On \vhich account, the form \Vhich the Earth alfumes \vill be that of an

oblate fpheroid, wbofe lhorter~ axis palfes througl1 the pol~s. By , irtue
only of the rotation of the Earth about its axis, the '"ejght of bodies at
the equator is lefs than at the pole.s, in the proportion of 288 to 289.
From .hence arifes, as before 9bferved, a fpheroidical fonn of the Earth~
ar1d from that fpneroidical form arifes another diminution of gravity at
the equator, by \Vhich, if the Earth vvere hotnogeneous throughout, bo-
dies at the equator would lofe one pound -in I r 21, and- fo, on both ac- ..
:ounts taken together,. the gravity of bodies at the pole? \vould be-to tl~e
iame at the equator .as 2 30 to 229. From \vhen:ce, tf \Ve fuppofe the·
gravity of bodies \vithin the Earth to be ·directly as their diftance from
~he centre, thofe numbers \vill alto exprefs the relation bet\\teen its polar
and equatoreal diatneter. This is upon a fuppofition .that the Earth \vas
at firfi fluid, or a .chaos, having its folid and fiuid.parts confufedly mixed
together; but )f we fuppofe .it at Hrfl: partly fluid and . partly dry, as it
now is, fince we find that the land is very nearly of_the f~n1e figure with
the fea, except raifed a little to prevent its being overflo\ved, tbe Eart_
h
n1uft frill be of the h'lme form; for otner\vife the major part of the \Vater
\Vould flo\v to\vards the equator; and fpread itfelf like an inundation over ~
all the lat1'd in thofe parts. This theory met \v·ith great oppofltion from
Monfieur Caffini, \V ho, having meafured the meridian of France, declared
(v;ith great reaibn likewife, if the obfervations h~d been corre¢1') that the
Earth, inftead of being flattened,. \Vas lengthened tovvards the poles, that
is, infread of being an oblate it was an oblong fpheriod, higher at the
poles by ·about ninety-five n1ilcs. So \'\'ide a difference, between philo-
fophers of fo high rank, detennined at length the King of France, at an
cxpence becoming a monarch; to e1nploy .t\\'0 companies of·mathemati-
ciaus, the·one to tneafure the ·length of a .degree of the meridian at the
equator, ·and the other the length of a degree at the polar circle, that by .
comparing them togethei·, and \\'ith the length of the degree of France, it
might be kno\vn 'vhether the Earth \Vere oblong.or flat. towa~ds the poles.
It is certai~, if the lengths .o( the degrees of latitude decreafe as we
go from the equator to\vards ·the poles, then the axis is greater, and the
figure an oblong {pheriod; but on the ~ontrary~ if thefe lengths increafe
as you remove to\*.'ards the poles, the axis is lefs than ~ diam~ter at the
equator, and confequently the figure an oblate fpheriod. This lall: ap~
pears, as \vell.by the-theory .of Sir Ifaac Newton, to be ~he true figure~
as it does by the refpetl:ive menfurations of thefe tn~thematicians, which
\vere performed "\vith furprifing exaCtnefs. The figure of the ~arth be-
ing thus deter!nined, \Ve nex~ proceed to thew the _
triple means whereby
it is agita_te~ and governed _
in its tnotion, and \vhereby night and day, and ·
all .the phrenomena of the fenfons, are produced.

In the firfi place, the Earth is found to have :i Jiur11al tnotioli round
its O\Vll axis, fro1n \vefi to call:, \Vh~ch it perfonns in t\veuty-four ho\tr •
and thereby occalions the perpetual fucceffion of days and night:;. It is
cycry \vay agreeable to rcafon, that the J~arth fhould revolve about its O\Vll
axis, to ac:·count for the appearance of fi1ch a vail: nutnbcr of fiars, \vhich
fccm to pcrfonn their revolutions round the earth in t\vcnty-four hours;
for the motion of thefe fiars, \\'Cre it real, \\'ould be incredibly f,vift, and
beyond all in1aginntion, becnufc their difiance in refpeCl of us is almoft
infinite, and the orbit they have to run round fo prodigioufly great, that
they 1nu!l: n1ove at leall J oo,ooo miles in a minute.
'The Earth has, fecondly, an alrnua/tnotion round the Sun, \vhich it
performs every }'Car, \vhercby it produces the different fcafons, and the
Jcngtbening and fl1ortening Of the uays. ]t being 110\V an efiabJifucd

\vhen the Earth feen frotn the Sun is in either of the points r or ~, a

cide \vith_the common fetlion of the equator and ecliptic, and \vill then

it is in the plane of the equator. But the L'lme line is alfo perpendicular
to the circle \vhich bt>unds the light and darkneis, and.therefore the axis
of the. Earth \vill be in the plane of that circle, \vhich \Vill therefore pa!s

Sun; .bu't, in V1, it makes. a ·right angle .\vith the· line S P, \vhich joins
the cetltre of the Sun and Earth. And becallfe the line SP is not in the
plane of tl~e -equator, but in that of the ecliptic, the angle BPS, which
the axis of the Earth B A makes with it, .,vill not npw be ·a right angle,
but an oblique one of 66f degrees, \Vhich is the fame \vith the incliua..
tion .of the axis to the plane of the ecljptic. . Let the angle SPL l?e a
right angle, apd the circle, bounding light.and darknefs, will pafs through
the point L, and then the .arch BD, or the angle BPL, \vill be 2 3i de-
grees, that is, eqt!al to the cotnplement of the angle BPS to·a right angle.
Let the angle B P E be a right angle,:and then tne .line PE will be in the
plane of the equator. Thet:efore, becaufe the arches BE an~ L Tare equal,
each of then1 being quadrants, if the common arch BT be taken away,
there will remain T E equal to LB, equal to 23~ degrees. Take E·M equal
to E ~' and through the points M and T defcribe two parallel circles, T C,
M N; the one rep.refents the tropic of Cancer, and the other the tropic of
Capricorn. And, the Earth being in this fituation, the Sun \vill approach
the neareft that it can come to the North Pole : he \Vi1l ihine perpendi-
cularly ·on the point T, and confequently will be vertical to all the in-
habitants under the tropic of Cancer, when he cotnes to their meri.:.
dians. It is ·manifeft that the. circle \vhich bounds light and darknefs
reaches beyond the North Pole B to L: but towards the fouth it falls
fhort fo the South P.ole A, and reaches no further than F. Through
L and F, let t\vo parallels to the equator be defcribed. "'Thefe \vill re-
.. prefent the p<?lar circles, and, while the Earth is, in P, all that traB: of
it which is included \Vithin the polar circle K L continl}es in the light,
not\vithfianding the con!l:ant revolution round the axis. On the contrary,
thofe that lie 'vithin the antarCtic circle remain in continual darknefs.
· It is alfo manifefr, that all the parallels bet\veen the equator and the
arCl:ic- circle are cut by the circle bounding light and darknefs into un-
eqaal por~ions, the largefl: portions of thefe circles remaining in the ligbt,
and the finalleil: in darknefs ; but tbefe parallels which are to\varJs the
antarCtic circle have their greateft pottibns it1 darknefs~ and their.lea~ in
light; and the difference of thefe ·portions' \\'ill be greater or le(<;, accord-
ing as ·the circles are nearer to the pole or to the equator. Therefore
when the Sun is feen in Cat)cer $, 'the inhabitants of the· northern ~e- .
mifphere will have their days at the longeft, and their nights a,t the

,':vhereas, \vhen .the Sun .is .in the eighth degr.ee of Cancer, his diameter
is but thirty-one minutes forty feconds-. - Hen~e it is evident, that the
Sun is really nearer to us in the mid!l: of winter than it is in the midfl: of
fumtner: but this :feems .a paradox to many, \vho think the Sun mufi:
11eeds be hottefl: when it is nearefi: to us, and that the Sun is apparently
more difiant from :us in December than in June. As to the Sun's being
hotter, it is true, it is fo to alf thofe places which receive his rays directly
or :perpendic~larly ; buf ZQ.Je find his heat abated on account of the obli-
quity .{)f the rays, and his fhort continuance above the horizon at that
tim~. And, as to his ·diftance, it is only \vith refpecl: to the zenith of

the place, not the centre of the earth; fince it is plain the Sun n1ay
approach the centre of the earth at the fiune tin1e that it recedes from
the zenith of any place. And, agreeably to the Sun's nearer difiancc in
the \vinter, \\'C obfervc his npparcnt motion is then quicker than in the
fummer; for in the eighth degree of Capricorn it is about lixty-one
aninutes per d:-ay, but in the eighth degree of Cancer his motion is but
fifty-fcven n1inutes per day. Accordingly, \VC find the fummer half-
year eight days longer than the \Vintcr half-year, as appears by the fo1lo\Y-

The difference iri the t\vo half-years is - - 8 Days.
For, the Sun,s attracting force being one part of the caufe of the planet's
motion, and this force always increafing and decreafing in the inverfe
ratio of the fquares of the difiances, it is evident the velocity of the
planet \Vill al\vays be greater the nearer it is to the Sun, and v~ct veifa.
In this manner the Earth's r:notion round the Sun is invariably continued,

fomc, and the deprcffion of others, towaras the end of the deluge, this
mafs of water fell back to\vards the lo\vefi parts of the earth, into lakes
and ot!1er cavities, into the channel of rhe ocean, and through the fiffurcs

Mr. Whifion, on the contrary, in his New Theory of the Earth, fup-
pofes the deluge began on the 18th of November, in the 2365th year of
the Julian period, that is, 2349 years before the Chrifiinn rera; that
a comet defcending towards its perihelion, in the. plane of the eclipric,
paffed quite near the globe of the earth the very fi1me day that the deluge
began : he nfcribcs to the univerfal deluge all the changes and a.Itcrations
that have happened in the furface and in!ide of the globe: he adopts the
hypothefis of Dr. Woodward, and indifcriminately n1akcs ufc of all the ,
obfervations of this author, \Vith regard to the prefent fiate of the globe.

to occailonfan univerfal deluge, the waters of .which \Vould eafily cover-

whole ,deluge, to thefe waters only, for. ~greeably to Scripture, he affirm~
that the earth, .upon the approach of the con1et, vvould no doubt feel the
force of its attraCtion ; fo that .the fluid, contained in the great abyis,.
would be agitated by fo violent a flux and reflux, that the iuperficial cnrft
of the earth col:lld not refift it, but _
be broken in feveral places, and the _
internal \Vaters diffufed over the furface, '' and the.fountains of the great
deep broken up.u Mr. \Vhifron, to difpofe of all this vvater, fuppofes,
that as foon as the earth, in continuing its courfe, had got fome \Vi:lJ. front
the comet, the effects of its ·attraCtion, the flux and reflux, ceafed in the
great abyfs, and then the fuperior ·waters \ver~ violently precipitated
·through the fame paffages by which they came out; the great abyfs
fwallowed up all the fuperfluous .waters, and its cavity.\vas found capable
enough to receive, not only the \vaters \Vhich it had already contai11ed,
but alfo of thofe vvhich the tail of the comet had ]eft behind it; fince
during the time of its agitation and the burfiing of its cruft, it had en-
larged the fpace by breaking down, on all hands, the earth that environed
it. It \yas, in like manner·, at this time, that·the eC}rth, \vhich till then
\Vas fpherical, became el1iptic, occafioned not only by the effect of the
centrifugal force caufed by its diurnal revolution, but like\vife by the
action of the comet ; and that becaufe the earth, in pafiing through the
tail of the comet, \vas fituated in fuch a manner, th~t it pr~fented its
equatorial parts to this body; and becaufe the force of the comet's ·
attraCl:ion, concurring with the cel!trifugal force of the earth, took
a\vay· thofe parts of the equator \Vith fo much the more facility, as the
cruft \vas broken and disjoined in a vail: many places ; and becaufe the ac..
tion of the flux and reflux of the abyfs made .a more violent impreffion
upon the parts under the equator than any \vhere e]fe.

Dr.. Halley refo1ves the deluge into the !hock of a comet, or fome oth~r

by it in the fea, he obferves, would be fufficient to account for all thefe

to naturalifis ho\V far the fame caufes, \vhich mufi. have produced not
only the mixtures, but the cavities and fiffures in the earth, have been
the inlet and caufe Jike,vifc of earthquakes and volcanoes. Earthquakes
confiU of a violent agitation or trembling of the earth, gencral1y attended
\Vith a terrible npiic like thunder, and fometimes \Vith an eruption of
, :fire, water, \Vind, &c. ·Volcanoes are hollo\v, fubtcrraneous, combufiiblc,
mountains, v1hich vomit forth fire, flatnc, afhes, cinders, &c. Earth-
quakes and volcanoes are both accounted for upon the fame principles,
and may be thus explained. Thofe countries \Vhich are hollo\v and
fubtcrraneous, and \vhich natura11y yield great fiorc of fulphur and nirre,

bling in the bo\~lels of the earth, and lifting up the .ground above it; fo
as fometimes · to n:1ake a n1iferable havock and devafiation, till it gets
vent or a difchargc. 13urning n1ountains and volcanoes are· only fo many
(piracies fcrving for the difcharge of this fubterranean fire, when it is
thus preternaturally affen1bled. And where there happens to be fuch
a firuCl:ure and conforn1ation of the interior parts of the ea~th, that .the·
fire n1ay pafs freely ~nd \vithout .impedi1nent fron1 the caverns therein, .
it affen1bies into-thefe ·fpirals, and then read1ly and eafily gets out fron1
tin1e co tin1c \vitbout £11aking or diiturbing the t·arth. But \Yherc a
communication is wanting. or the paffages are not fufficieotly large and
open, fo that it cannot come at the fttid fpiracles \Vithout firft forcing and
ren1oving all obftacles, it heaves up and !hocks the earth, till it hath
made its ,v,ay to the mouth of the volcano ; \V here it rufhes forth,
fometin1es in tnighty flames, \Vith great.velocjty, and a terrible bellow-
ing noife. Earthquakes arc fometimes confined to a narrow fpace, which
is properly the effeCt of the re-atl:ion of the fire, and they ihake the earth
juft as the·explofion of a po\\'der-magazine caufes a fcnfible concuffion at
the difiance o'f fe\~eral leagues. 'I'bus a violent eruption of· Etna \vill
caufe an earthquake over all the ifland of Sicily; qut it never w jl] extend
to the diilance of three or four hundred leagues. ln like manner, when
fame nev1 vents of fire have been forn1ed in mount Vefuvius, there are
felt at the fame time earthquakes at Naples,. and in the neighbourhood
of the volcano; but thefe concuffions have never fhaken the ·Alps, nor
been communicated to France, or other countries ren1ote from Vefuvius.
Sometimes they are felt at confiderable difiances, and fhake a long traCt
of ground \vithout any eruption or volcano appearing. We have in-
fiances of earthquakes which were felt at the fame time in England, France,
Gern1any, and even in Hungary, and thefe extend ah.vays a great deal
tnore in length than in breadth; they fhake a traCt ofground with more or
·Jefs v.iolen~e in different places, in proportion as it is remote from the
fire; and they are ahnoft a)ways accompanied \yith a dull noife like that
of a he~vy catriage rolling along \Vith great rapiduy. · :
Dr. Woodward· gives us another theory of earthquakes. He endea-
~ours 'to :!ho\v, that the fubterraneous heat or fire, which is continually
elevating·

verted frorn irs ordinary courfc by fon1c accidental glut or obfirutl:ion ia
the po,·cs or paffngcs through \\'hich it ufed to afccnd to the furfacc, hc-
cotncs by fuch tncans preternaturally aCfcrnblcd in n greater quantity than
ufual into one place, and therefore cnuf~· th a grc:,t rarcfattion and intu-
mcfccnrc of the \\·ater of the abyfs, putting it into grent comn1otions nnd.
difordcrs, and at the (tnlc tin1e making the Jikc efiort on the earth; \Vhich
being t:xpanded upon the face of the ahyfs, occaGons the agitatioo and con-
cuffion \Vhich \Ve call an earthquake.
But Dr. Stukelcy has introJuced a nc\v notion in the theory of earth-
quakes, and has endeavoured to prove th.H they arc caufcd by electricity.
l-Ie urges a variety of objcCJ:ions ngainfi the foregoing hypotheli$, vvhich
afcribcs earthquakes.. to fubterraneous \vinds, fires, vapours, or any thing
that occafions an cxplofion, a~d thus heaves up. the ground. He thinks
there is no evidence of the cavernous firucture of the earth, which thi.$
hypothefis requires ; but that, on the contrary. there is rcafon to believe
that it is in a great meafure folid. Earthquakes have alfo frequently
happened \Vithout any eruption of fire, vapour, fn1okc, or fmell, \Vhich
he thinks is utterly inconfifient \Vith the iuppofition of their being oc-
cafioned by any fubtcrraneous vapours; efpecially in cafes 'vhere the
{hock is of confiderable extent; befides, this is a caufe altogether inade..
quate to fuch an effcCl:; for a fubterraneous po\ver capable of moving a
furface of earth only thirty tni1es in diatneter, mufi be lodged at lcafi:
fifteen or t\venty 1niles belo\v the furface, and move an inverted c:one of
folid earth, \vhofe bafe is thirty tnilcs in diameter, and its axis fifteen or
t\venty 'miles, \vhich he judges to be abfolutely impoffible; ho\v much
more inconceivable, then, that any fuch power could produce the earth..
qi1ake of 1755, \vhich \vas felt in various parts of Europe and Africa,
and the Atlantic Ocean; or that of Afia Minor, A. D. 17, by \vhich
thirteen great cities \Vere defiroyed in one night, and \Vhich 1hook a
mafs of earth three hundred miles in diameter, in order to \vhich the
moving po\ver, if it had been internal fire or vapour, muft have been
lodged -t\VO hundred n1iles belo\v the furfacc 1 Farther, in earthquakes
the effeCt is infinntaneous; \Vhereas the operation of elaflic vapour and
the difcharge of it muft be gradual, and require a long fpacc of time;
and, if they \Vere o\ving to explolions, they muft alter the furface of the
country \\'here they happened, dellroy the fountains and fprings, and
cnange the courfe of its rivers, 'vhich is contradicted by hifiory and ob-
fer\'ation. To all \vhich it is added, that the firokes ,vhich l~1ips rcceh'e

· nk·a~e motion ··of a much· greater velocity than any heaving of the ear~h
under the fea by"the elafiicity of generated vapours, which \Vould onJy
pro.duce a gradual 'fwell, and not an impulfe of the ,water, refembling a
thump againfi th'e botton1 of a (hip. or !lri~ipg agaipfi: ,a rock. Dr.
St'UK~ley, finding the-common :hypothefis infufficient, \yas led to con-
clude that earthquakes \Vere proper eletl:rical !hocks; and a parti-'
t!Jlar furvey of tbe phenomena, that either precede or attend them~
tonfir~ned tnis 'opinion: he obferved that the \Veather WUS ufually dry
arid ·'vvarn1 ~ for fo_
n1e time before an earthquake happened, and t~at the
furface of the ground is thus previoufiy difpofed for that kind of elcc-
. trical vibration in ,\vhich it confifis; w hiHl: at the fame.. titne, in forne
pla'ces ~ where earthqu'akes have happened, the internal parts, at a fn1a1l
d,epth below the furface, are moifi and boggy; and thence he infers, that
they reach very little beHnv the furfacc. He adds, that the fouthern re-
gipns are more fubjeet to earthquakes than the northern,. on account of
the.greater \-Varmth and drynefs of the earth and air, which are qualities
fo nece!faiy to electricity:. It \Vas alfo-. obferved, that, before the earth-
quakes at London in 1749, all vegetables we~e remarkably for\vard; and
eletl:ricity is \velt kno\vn to quicken vegetation. ..fhey vvere like"vife
preceded by frequent and fingular appearances o.f the aurora borealis and
au!lralis, and by a yariety of other rneteors \V hich indicate an eleB:rical
fiate of the atn1ofphere. Dr. Stukeley apprehends, that1 ·in this !hue of
the earth and air, nothing more is neceffiuy to produce an earthquake.
t.han the approach of a non-eleCtric cloud to any part of the earth, when
in an highly-eletlrified fiate, ..and the difcharge of its contents upon it;
and that, as the difchnrge from an excited tube occafions a comrnotion
in the human body, fo the ·fhock, produced ~y ·the difcharge bct\\'een ,
t'he cloud and 1nany miles in con1pafs of folid earth, muft be an earth-
quake, and the fnap from the contact be the noife attending it. He
fuppofes that a large black.cloud, which fudden1y covered the bemifphere .
a little before the earthquake of 1749, might have occafioned the tbock,
by the djfcharge of a fuo\ver.- · 'I'he noife, it has been obferved, ufually .
precedes the fhock; vvhereas, if the concuffion depended.upon a fubter-
raneous eri1ption~ it muft have been quite the contrary. 1'he flames and
fulphureous fme1ls w,hich fometimes attend earthquakes are more eafily
accounted for, as Dr. Stukeley thinks, f~·om the fitppofition of their be-
ing el~Cl:rical phenomena than on any other hypothefis. 1"he fudden
, _
extenfive agitation, both of ']and and \Vater, occafioned by "
earthquakes,

and finally fron1 the effects \vhich they produce on \veak confiitutions,

vibratory !late, \V hich prepares then1 to give or receive rhat fnap, #tnd
{hock, \V hich is called an earthqu~1ke; but this he thinks as difficult to·
account for as n1agnerifn1, gravitation, mufcular motion, nnd many other
fecrets in nature. Several circtunfiances have been remarked by other
· \vriters, \V hich confirm the theory that fuppofes earthquakes to be elec-
trical phenomena. Signior Beccaria, \Vhofe name often occurs in the
hifiory of electricity, agrees \Vith Dr. Stukelcy, in fuppofing, that earth-
quakes are eleCtrical phenomena; but he in1agincs "'that the eleCtric
matter \vhich occafions them is lodged deep in the bo\vels of the earth;
and if in this iituation its equilibrium £11ould by any tneans be defiroyed,
fo that th~ heft method of refioring it (ha1l be by the fluids burfting its·
\vay into t~1e air, and traverfing feveral miles of the atmofphere to come
to the place \vhere it is \Vanted, it n1ay eafily be conceived, th:lt violent
concuffions n1ay be given to the earth, by the fuddcn paffi1ges of thi~
po\verful agent; and that the electric fluid is Iometimes coJiected
in the bowels of the e<lrth, he thinks probable froln. the appear-
ance of ignes .fatui in mines, which fometitnes happens, and is very
probably an eleCtrical phenon1enon. 'fhis ingenious philofophcr ob..
ferves, that, if t\vo pieces of glafs, indofed in a thin piece of metJl, be
held in the hand, 'vhile a Ltrge {hock is fe~t through them, a firong'
concuffion or vibration \vill be felt, \vhicb fometin1es breaks them to
pieces. Mr. Henley, another excellent electrician, has diicovercd a me- ·
thad of increafing the effctt of the explofion upon glafs, (o as to afford a
very natural idea of an earthquake. Bet\veen rhc ends of t\vo \vires, laid
on a piece of glafs, \Vith their extremities pointing to each other and
about an inch diflant, through \Vhich the diicharge is to be made, he
places a thick piece of ivory upon . the glafs, and on the ivory a \Veight
at pleafitre, from one-fourth of an ounce to fix pounds; the ghtfs is
broJ<en by an explufion into innun1erablc fragments, and fon1e of it is
reduced into an impalpable powder; the weight is lhaken by the explofion,
and fometin1es thro\vn off from the ivory. In this cxpcricnent, if the .
glafs is very thick, fo that the force of the cxplo!iou is not fufficicnt to
break it, it \V ill be found marked \Vith the mofi lively priftnntic colours.
'fhe appearan~c of an earthquake n1ay he alia reprefcntcd by caufing the
exP.lofion of a battery to pais over the furfacc of any fubfianccs on \vhich

:fmall flicks or cards are placed, which will never fail to be f11aken, and
often be thrc)\vn do\vn, by the explofion; or, by tnaking a difcharge over
·the furface of \Vater, in \vhich cafe the report \Vill be much Jouder than
\vhen the difcharge is n1adc through the air; and a hand plunged deep
.into the \Vater \viii feel the concufiion; and we may add, that the fpark
\vhich paffes over the furface of the water in this experiment bears a
great refen1blance to thofe balls of fire that have fotnetitnes been feen over
the furface of the fea or land in the time of an earthquake. . Dr. Prie!lley
contrived various methods of exhibiting the phenon1eila of earthquakes.
He made the eleCtric flafl1 to pafs over \Vet boards fwimrning in \Vater,
over either of thefe· feparately, or over both at once, on \vhich piilars,
&c. \vere ereCl:ed; and thus, \vhile the board reprefentcd the earth, and
the water the. fea, the phenomena of both du~ing an earthquake \Vere
exhibited at the fatne time. Dr. Prieftley, the ingenious hifiorian ·of
electricity, after having largely recited the obfervations of Dr. Stukeley
and Signior Beccaria, does not abfolutely decide which of thefe t'\VO phi-
]ofophers has advanced the more probable opinion concerning the feat
of the eleCtric tnatter \vhich occafions earthquakes; but he thinks a more
probahle general hypothefis than either of thetn may be for,n1ed out of
them both. - Suppofe, fays he, the electric matter to be fome \vay or
other aCC!Jmulated on one part of the furface of the earth, an~, on ac-
count of the drynefs of the feafon, not eafily to ditfufe itfelf; it may,
as Signor Beccaria fuppofes, force itfelf away into the higher regions of
the air, forming clouds in its paifage out of the vapuurs \vhich float in
the atmofphere, and occafion a fudden fuower. \Vhich ,may farther pro-
mote the pa!fage of t,he fluid. ,.fhe \vhole furface, thus unloaded, \vil1
receive a concuffion, like any other conduCting fubfrance, on parting
""'ith, or receiving, a quantity of the electric fluid; the ruihing noife
will Iikewi1e fweep over the \Vhole extent of the country; and, upon
this fuppofition alfo, the fluid, in it~ difcharge frotn ·the country, \viii
naturally follow the courfe of the rivers, and alfo take th~ advantage of
any eminences to facilitate its .afcent into the higher regions of the air.

The earthquake \vhich h:1ppcncd in Sicily in the year 1692-3, ns rc-
l.ltcd by Mr. 1-lartop, F. llurgos, nnd '\rin. Donajulus, is one of the
n1oft fatal, and exhibits th~ n1ofl Luncnrablc catallrophe of the kind
recorded in hillory. It extcnJcJ over the \v hole ifland ; nod even NapJc
and Malta \Vcrc atfcCl:cd by the ihock. It \\·as one of rhc fccond kind tncn-
tioncd by ,\rifiotle and Pliny, viz. a perpendicular pulL1tion or fuccuO:ion.
~rhe 1notion \\.~\S fo rapid and violent, that no body could fi:tnd upon
their legs ; thofc \Vho lay on the ground \Verc to!fcd frotn fide to /ide as
on a rolling billo\v, and high walls leaped fron1 their foundations many
yards difiant. 'fhe mifchicf it did is an1nzing; almoll: alJ the buildings
in the country \Vcrc thrown do\Vt). l.,ifty-four citi<:s and tO\VOS, be!iJcs
an incredible number of villages, were either defiroyed or greatly da-
n1nged. \Ve fi1all only infinnce the fate of Catania, one of the n1o!l
f~unous, ancient, and flonrifh ing, cities in the kingdom, the reCidcnce of
fcvcr,ll n1onarchs, and an uni\'erfity. This once h1111ous, now unhappy.
Catania, to ufc the \vords of F. Burgos, had the greatefr !hare in the
tragedy. F. Anton. Scrrovita, being on his \Vay thither, and at the dif-
tancc of a fe\V miles, obferved a hlack cloud, like night, hovering over
the city; and there arofe from the mouth of Mont Gibello great fpires of
flame, \Vhich fprcad all around. '!"he fea, all of a fudden, began ro
roa-r, and rife in billo\VS; and there \vas a noife as if all the artillery in
the world had been at once difcharged. The birds fl~\V' about afionif11ed; .
the cattle in the fields ran crying, &c. His and his companions, horfes
fropped iliort, trembling; fo that they \Vere forced to alight. ·rhcy
\Vcre no fooner off, but they were lifted from the ground above t\VO paln1s;
when, ca!l:ing· their eyes to\vards Catania, they \Vith an1azen1ent fa,v no-
thing but a thick cloud of dufl: in the air. 'l'his \Vas the fcene of their
calan1ity ; for of the magnificent Catania there \vas not the lea!l: footficp
to be feen. S. Bonnjutus a1Tures us, that, of 18,914 inhabitants, tS,ooo
peri{hed therein. The fan1e author, from a computation of the inhabi-
tants, before and after the earthquake, in the teveral cities and tO\vns. finds
that near fo,coo perifued out of 254,900.
Jamaica is remarkable for earthquakes. The inhabitants, Dr. Sloane
informs us, expeCt one every year. 'fhis author gives us the hifiory of
one in 1687 ; and another horrible one in 1692 is defcribed by fe\·eral
anonymous authors. - I1;1 t\VO minutes time this !hook do\vn and dro\\"ned

and the port of Calais in I>eru, in 1-746, which lafl:ed fifteen n1inutcs,
and demolifhed 1nofi of the buildings in the city. and defl:royed mofi of
the inhabitants, and f'vvalJo\ved up feveral !hips then in the port; that of
London, in 1749; thofe in 1750, felt in 1nany parts of England ; that
of 1 777, felt in the north of England; or that at Li!bon, in 1755, though
.this deferves a more particular account than tnany others of rnuch lefs
confiderable extent and duration.
The three preceding years had been remarkably dry, infomnch that
fo1ne fprings of \Vater were totally loft; and the predominant \Vinds \vere
eafi and north-eafi, accompanied \Vith various, though very fn1all, mo-
tions and trembJings of the earth. The fpring of the year 1755 \\'as very
rainy and ~vet; the weather on the day preceding the earthquake, \vhich
happened on the 1fi of November, \Vas clear and uncomn1only \Vann for

quake happened at Cadiz 'vas as cl~ar and fcrene as the finefi fuintner-day

fiderably dan1aged. 'The effeds of this earthquake,· in violently agitating

Of the T I D E S.
1·bc l~ides arc t\vo periodical n1otiqns of the \Vaters of the fea, called
alfo the flux and refluxt or the ebb and flo\v. \V·hen the 1v1oon is in
the firtl: and third quarter, i.. c. \\'hen !he is bc\v and fuJI, the tides arc
high and i\vift, and are called Jpring-tide.r-\vhcn the is in the fecond
and laft qttlrter, the tides are lo\vcr and flo,ver, and are called Jltap-tide.t.
· In the phenomena of the tides, the fea is obferveJ to flo\v, for certain
hours, frotn fouth towards north; in \vhich n1otion, or flux, \vhich latl:s
about fix hours, the f~a gradual1y f\vells; fo that, entering the mouths
of ri~·crs, it drives back the rivcr-\vaters to\vard their heads, or 1prings.
/\fter a continuul flux of fix hours, the fea fccrns to reft for about a
quarter of an hour; after \Vhich it begins to ebb, or retire h~c-k ag~in.
fron1 north to fouth, for fix hours more; in which time, the \Vater
ftnking, the rivers refume their. natural courfe. 'fhen, aftf::r a feeming
paufe of a quarter of an hour, the fca again begins to dlo\v1 as before;
and thus alte~nately. 'I'hus does the fea ebb t\vice a- day, and flo\v as
often ; but no~ in the fan1e hours thereof.. 'J'he period of a flux and
reflux is t1vvelve hours forty-eight minutes, fo that the tides return later
and later each day, by forty-eight minutes, or three quarters of an hour·
·and three minutes. Now t\velve hours forty-eight minutes is a lunar
day; i. e. the Moon paHes the Earth's meridian later and later each day
by forty-eight minutes. So that the fea flo\VS as often as the .i\loon
paffes the t\VO tr.eridians of the \Vorld, nan1ely, thlt above and th.:1t
belo\V the horizon! and ebbs as often as ihc palres the horizon, both
the caflcrn and \Vefiern points thereof. 1·his farther ag~ecn1ent we
like\vife obferve bct\Yeen the Moon and the fea, thc:tt the tides, though
con£lant, are not equal ; but are grcatefi: \vhen the Nloon is in conjunc-
iion or oppofition, and leall: \vhen in quartile thereto". But thofc tides

And thefe £1me effeCl:s are ·obferved throughout n1oH
·of the coa!ls of Euro11e; only that the tides ·are fo much· the· lefs, and ·
·· happen later,' as the: coafis are the more northerly.'
. Thefe phenomena of the tides are adrnirably accounted for from the
principles of gravftation. All that is_ requifite to their folution is, that
the Ea-rth ·2nd Moon, and evety parttcle thereof, ·mutually gravitate to-
wards each other; the reafonablenefs ·of which affumption is every \vay
apparent. Indeed, the fagacious Kepler, long ago,. conjeCtured this to
be the caufe of the tides. -'' If, (fays he,) the Earth ceafes to attratl: its
\Vaters towards itfelf, all the water in the ocean \vould rife and flow
into the,Moon: the fphere of the !vloon's attraCl:ion extends to our Earth,,
and ·dra\vs up the water..., 'I'hus .. thought Kepler, in his Introd. ad:-
Tl1eor. Mart. 'fhis furmife, for it \Vas then no more, is now abun-
dantly verified in the theory firft amply deduced by Dr. Halley from·
the· N'e,vtonian principles. Hov;ever, \Ve may obferve·, with M. de la·.
Lande, (Aftronon1ie, voJ. iv. Paris, 1781.) t~at feveral of the ancients,--
and among others, PJiny, Ptolorny, . and Macrobius, v:cre acquainted
with the influence of the Sun. and lyloon .upon the tides, And Pliny·
fays expreilly, that,the caufe of the ebb and flow is in the Sun, which at:..
traCts the \Vaters. o~ the ocean; and adds, that the \Vaters rife in propor-
tion to the proximity of the Moon to the Earth. .

&y this fum nnd difference of the Moon's nnd Earth's attraCtion there
\vill· necciTarily cnfue a protuberance or f,vclling of the \Vaters, \vhich
'''c call tides of flood, in the two points A and D direCtly under the
Moon. Alfo in the t\VO points F and J3, as the \Vaters are there mo!l:
attraCted, Co they \vill be hcavic!l, and confequently rife to the leaft
height from the Earth's furfacc, ,,·hence they are called tides of ebb, or
the ebbing of the \Vater. If to the power of the Moon \\'C add that of
the Sun, \VC f11all have the tides confidcrahly augmented at the conjunc-
tion in S, or oppofition in 11, that is, at the new and full Moons,
\Vhich arc calfcd the fpring-tidcs; as thofe \vhich happen \\'hen tht! Sun
is at 0 or P are called' neap-tid(!s, the \Vaters at A artd D being then
lo\vefi, bccaufe the attraCtion of the Moon is then counterbalanced by
that of the Sun. lt is farther to be obferveq, that of the two tides of
flood, at A and D, that at A is greatefi to any place "f jn the northern
latitude, \\·hen the Moon is in the northern figns, and above the horizon:
for the point A is then nearer the zenith of the place G than the oppo-
fite point D is to the fame place at R t\velve hours nftcr\varus; and con-
_fcquently, the height of the tide T G is greater rhan that of the oppofite.
tide Rg. "fhe contrary of this happens \Vhen the Moon is in the
fouthern figns.
That there are t\vo tides of flood, and· two of ebb, fuccec:ding each
other alternately at about the interval o( fix .hours, is obvious from the
figure : and that they happen later each day near an hour, is O\\·ing to
their exatl: corretpondence to the motion of the Moon, \\'hich datly
culminates fo· much later. That they happen not when the Moon is in
the rneridian. bur about three hours after, is owing to the force of the
Moon being then greater than when in the tne.ridian of any place; as the
heat of the day is greater at three o'clock than at t\velve; and the heat ·
of. the fummer is greater in Auguft than nt the 21ft of June. Lafily,
that the grenteil fpring-tidcs happen not at the 21 fr of March and 23d
of September, but in February and OCl:ober, is becaufe, the Sun being
ncarefl the Earth in December, his influence is then Jlrongeft, and fo

: We !hall nmv confider the phenomena of the tides \vhich retn.ain; and
fidl, it is' eviderit, ~hat if P N be the axis of the Earth, ?nd QO the

roid wou~d be fo p3fited a:s to have its longefi axis A B coinciding \Vith
the axis of the earth P N. In this pofition of the fpheroiJ, it is plain, there
could be no fuch th~ng as a tide in any parf of the ocean over. all the earth;
• for every feClion of the fphcroid, parallel to the equator, \\'oulJ be a circle;
coniequently, in any parallel of latitude, the \yater \vould be at an e·qual
diftance fron1 the earth's furface every tnotnent of the diurnal revolution,
or natural day. Suppofe the Moon 'verc rernoved from the direCtion of

\vhat has t\\'O tides of· Hood and t\Vo of ebb every t\VCnty-four hours.
J\nd this difil·rcncc of the flux and reflux \\'ill decrcafc frotn the equ~tor
to the poles.
It h,1s. been alrcadr ohfcrvcd, that rhe greaten clcv,uion of rhc \\'aters
is not \\'hen the lun1inary is in 1he tncridian, bl!t about three hot:rs after,
bccaufc the n1otion corn:nunic:lted to the \Vaters Juring rhc arrival of the
n1cridian is not in1n1cdiatt·ly dcfiroyed, but remains for fornc tilnc, ;tnd
rt!cei\'es a farther augn1ent:ttion from that \vhich is itnprefTcd for about
three liours after. For the Ltn1e rcafon, \VC obfcrvc,. the greJtefi an..l
Ieaft tides happen not on the day of the fyzygy, or quadrature, but on
the third or fourth after; ·the fun1 or difference of the forces of the lu-
n1innrics not being till then ~at a maximun1. Let SF 1~ G, jig. _s, be the
orbit of the IV1oon about the Earth Q.~ 0 P; but, as th1s is nor circu)Jr,
hut elliptical, the centre, of the Earth 'f \vill not be al\\·ays at an equal
difiance fron1 the. Moon; but the lVloon \vill be fometin1es nearefi the
J~anh, as \vhen at S, and fome~itnes farthefl off, as at E. 'fhe point S
is called the pcrigrcum, or perigee; and the point E the apog~um,
or apogee. 'fhe po\Ver of the Iv1oon in her perigee is to that in the apo-
gee nearly as ~r E1 to 1~ S~; and confequently the grcatcfi tides \vill be
on the day of the perigee,· or rather a fe\v days after, for the reafons
abo\~e- n1entioned.
..
Such \Vould the tides regularly be, if the I~arth \\·ere all o\~er covered
\V ith fea very deep, fo' that the "·ater n1ight follo\V the influence of the
Sun and Moon; but, by rcafon of the ihoalnets of fome places, and
the narro\vnefs of the il:reights in others, by 'vhich the tides are propa-
gJted, there arifes a great divcrfity in the eficet, not to be ,tccounted
for \Vithout an exact kno\vledge of all the ·circumfiances of the feveral
places \Vhere they happen; as the pofition of the land, the brcJdth and
depth of the channels, direction of the \Vinds, &c.
For a very fio\v and imperceptible motion of the \Vholc body of "~ater,
\vhere it is (for exan1pJe) t\vo miles deep, \vilJ fuffice to raifc its furf:1ce
ten or t\velv~ feet ;n a tide's time; \Vhcreas, if the £1me quantity of \Vater
'\Vere to be conveyed through a channel forty fathoms deep, it \Vould rc-
quire a very great !trcam to effuet it in fo large inlets~ as are the channel of
England and the German ocean; \vhence the tide is found to fet
fl:rongell in thofe places \vherc the fea gro\vs narro\ven, the fi1me quan-
tity of \Vater being, in that cafe, to pafs through a ftnaller paffi1gc. 'This

not check it. 'I'his force, being once in1pre!fed upon the \Vate~:, conti-
nues to carry it above the level of the ordinary height in ~he ocean, par-
ticularly \vhere the water meets· a direct obfl:acle, as it does. in St. Ma-
loes ; and where it enters into a long channel, whiGh, runx1ing far into the
land, gro\VS very firaight ·at it-s extrcmit)r, as it does into the Severn fea'
a:t Chepfi.o\v and Briflol. This !hoalne{s of the fca, and. the ir.
1fercur-
rent continents, are the reafons that in the open ocean the tides rife but ·
t9 very fn1a1l heights in proportion to \vhat they do in \V iJe-mouthed
rivers, opening in the direction of the flream of the tide, as it is obferved
upon all the \Vefrem coafts of Europe and Africa, fro1n Ireland to the
Cape of Good I-Iope; in all which a fouth-\veft Moon rflake~ high wa-
ter; and the fame is reponed to hold in the \Vcfl: of i\tnerica. So that
tides happen .to different places at all difrances of the Moon frotn the me-
ridian, and confequently at all hours of t4e lunar day.
It is to be confidered that, in order to allo\v the tides their full mo-
tion, the occari, in which they are pr.oduced, ought to be extended fronl
eafi to' weft ninety degrees at leafi. Becaufe the places, \V here the Moon
raifes 1
n1o!l: and moft depreffes the water, are at that di!tance from. each
other. l-Ienee it appears, that it is on1y in the great oceans that fuch
tides can be produced, and "vhy in the larger Pacific ocean they exceed
thofe in the Atlantic·ocean. lienee alfo it is obvious, \vhy the tides are
not fo great in the torrid zone, bet\veen .i\frica and America, where the
ocean is narro\ver, as in the temperate zones on .either fide ; and \\'{! may
hence alfo underftand, why. the tides are fo fmall in iflands that are very
far difiant from the fhores. It is manifefi ·that, in the Atlantic ocean,
the water cannot rife on one £bore but by defcending on the other; fo
that, at the intermediate difrant. ifiands-
, it tnuft continue at a mean
height betwixt its elevation on one and on the other 1hore. , But \Vhen
tides pafs over fhoals, and ·through fireights~ into bays of the fea, their"'
motion becomes more various and complicated, and their height ·depends -
on many circuh1fiances. ·
The tide that is produced O{l the \Vefiern coaAs of Europe, in the At...
]antic, correfponds to the fituation of the Moon already defcribed. 'fhus
it is high-\vater on the coacts of Spain, Portugal, and the \veft of Ireland,
about t~e third hour after the Moon has paffed the meridian ; and thence
it flows into the adjacent channels, as it finds the eafiefi p1ifage. One
current from it, for example, runs up by the fouth of Eng1and, another
comes in by the north of Scotland; they take a confiderable time to

they fJrfi con1c; and it begins.. to faJI nt thofc places \vhilfi they :tre fiill
going on to others that are farther in their courfe. As they rcrurn, theY.
are not ah)c to raife the tide, bccaufc the \Vater runs faller off than it
returns, till, by a nc\v tide propagated fron1 the open occany the return
of the current is !lopped, and the \Vater begins to rife again. 1 he tide,
propagated by the Moon, in the Gern1an ocean, \vhen fl1c is three hours
pufr the meridian, t:1kcs t\\'clve hours to come frorn ·thence to IJondon-
bridgc; fo that, \Vhcn it is high-water there, a new tide is already carne
. to tts height in the ocean; and, in fome intermediate place, ic mutt be
lo\V-\Vater at the fame time. Confcquently, when the Moon has .north
declination, and \Ve Q1ould expect the tide at London. to be the greatcfr
\vhen the Moon is above the horizon, \Vc find it is leaft; and the con- ,
trary \vhen fhe has fouth declination. At fcvcral places it is bigh..\\·ater
three hours before the Moon comes to the meridian; but that tide \Vhich
the ~loon pufues, as it \vere, before her, is only the' tide oppofite to rhat
which \Vas raifed by her \vhen £he \Vas nine hours paft the meridian.

It \Vou1d be endlcfs to recount all particular folutions. 'vhich pre:
eafy corollaries· fro1n this dodrinc; as, \vhy the Jakes and feas, fuch as.
the Cafpian fea and the Mediterranean fea, the Black fca nnd Baltic, have
no fcnfible tides: for lake~ are gcneralJy fo fmall, that \vhen the lVloon
is vertical fhe attraCts every part of thcnl alike, and therefore ·no part of
the \Vater can be raifed higher than another; and, having no conlmunica-
tion with the ocean, it can neither increafc .nor dimini!h their \Vater, in
order to rife or fall; and feas that cotnmunicate by fuch narro\v inlets,.
and are of fo immenfe an extent, cannot, in a fe\V hours 'time, receive
and empty \Vater enough to raifc Or fi'nk their furface any thing fenfibfy..
To demon1l:rate the excellency of this doctrine~ the example of the·
tides to the port of· Batfha, in the kingdom of 1"onquin in the Eatl: In-
dies, in. 20 degrees 50 minutes north latitude, \Vhich are fo extraordinary
and different from all others \\'e have yet heard of, may fuffice. 'fhe·
day in \vhich the 1\Ioon patfcs the equinoCtial, the \Vater il:agnates there
\vithout any motion; as the Moon removes from the equinoctial, tbe
water begins to rife and fal~ once a-day; and it is high-~vater at the fee-.
ring of the Moon, and lo\v-\vater at her riling. 'fhis daily tide in-
creafcs for about fcven or eight days, and then dccreafcs for as rnany days
by the farnc degrees, till this motion ceafes, \vhen the Moon has fCturncd,
to the equinoctial: 'Y.hen fhe has pa!fcd the cquinotlial,. and declines
"
to\vard the fouth pole, the \Vater rifes and f,t!Js again. as before; but it is,

Sir Ifaac Newton,. in order to account for this extraordinary tide, confi-.

ders .that there are t\vo inlets to this port of Bat(ba, one fron1 the Chincfe
ocean, betwixt the continent ·and the Manillas, the other from the Indian
ocean, bct\vixt the, continent and Borneo. rfhis leads him to propofe, as
a folution of .this phe!lOOlen~n, that a tide may arrive at Batfha, through
one .of thefe· tnlets, ·at the th1rd hour of the. Mo'?n, and another through
the ,other inlet, fix hours after, at the ninth hour of the Moon. For,
\V hile the tides are equal, the one fl.o\v ing in as the other ebbs out, the
\Vater. muft fiagnatc; now they are equal \vhen the Moon is in the equi-
noctial; but, as foon as the Moon begins to decline on the ~une tide of
rbe equator \vith Bat!ha, it has been !ho\vn that the diurnal tide rnufl:
exceed the nocttirnal, fo that t1vvo greater and t\VO Iefs tides n1uft arrive
at Bat01a by turns., The difference of thefe \vill produce an agitation of
the water,- \Vhich w!l1 rife to its greateft height at the mean tin1e bet\vixt
fhe t\VO greateil tides, and fall lo\veft at a n1ean tilne betwixt the two
leaft tides; {o that it 'vill be high-V\rater abont the futh hour at the fet-
ting of the .Moon, and lo\v-water at her rifing. When.the Moon has got
to the other fide of the equinoctial, the nocturnal 'tide \vill exceed the
diurnal; and, th~refore, the high-\vater '~'ill be at the rifing, and lo\v-
\Vater at the letting, of the lVloon. ~rhe L
1n1e principles \vill ferve to
account for other extraordinary tides, \vhich, vve are told, are obfer\'ed
jn places -whofe fituation expofes thetn to. fuch irregularities, and .\vhich
apfear to· admit of no other folution.
· '\tVhen the time of high-\vater at any place is, in general, tnentioned,
it is to be underfl:ood on the days of the fy zygies, or days of ne\V and full
Moon; \vhen the Sun and Moon pafs the tneridian of the place at the
fame titr{e. _Among pilots, it.is cuilomary to reckon the ,time of flood,
or high-water, }:y the point of. the compafs the Moon bears on, allo\ving
three quarters of an h_
our for each point, at that time; thus·, on the full
and change days, in places \V here it is flood at noon, the tide is f:1id to
flow north and fouth, or at t\Velve o'clock; in other places, on the fatne
days, where .the Moon bears I., z, 3, 4• or inore, points to the eafi: or
weft of the n1eridi'an, \Vnen it is high-\vater, the tide is faid to .flo,v on
fuch point; thus, if the Moon bears S. E. at flood, it is faid. to flo\v
S. E. and N. W. or three hours bifore the meri~ian, that is, at nine
o'clock; if it bears S. W. it floyvs S. W. and N. E, or at three hours
after the meridian ; and in like n1ann~r for other tin1es of the Moon's
bearing. The tin1cs of high...,Nater in any p1ace fall about the fi1n1e hours
after a period of about fifteen days, or between one fpring..tide and ano-
ther; but, during that period, tb~ times of high-\vater fall each day later
hy about forty-eight minutes. Fron1 thefe calculations, affified by the.
obfervations of anumber of different perfons' there have been colledcd'.

, the time of the l\1oon's fouthing, and then add the tin1e which the l\Ioon
has palfed the meridian at the full and change days, to tnake high-water .·
at that place; and the fum "'ill ?e the tin:e o~ hign-watet~ on the given

This theory of tides has been extended fo far, as to eftimate the tides.;
or elevation of the waters of the 1\I_oon, pro?uced ·by the a;ttra&ion of
the Earth; thus, let us fuppofc the quantity of matter ( Q.) in the Earth
to be to that in the l\'1oon (q) as forty to one, that is, Q:. q : : 40: 1;
:tnd let us firft fuppofe the Earth and ~1oon of equal b~lk, and rep_refented

Again, let L B be to L ~ as the diameter of the Earth to that of the
ll'Ioon, '\vhich is as 365 to 1oo, then will the force at B be to the force at C

raife the water a·t the ~Ioon C is to that of the Moon at the Earth A as
eleven to one, very nearlx. If the Moon can raife the water here I 0
feet, the Earth can raife.the water there to the height of I 10 feet; but,
. becaufe the 1\IJOOf! a}V\'ays turns about her axis in the fame time as fhe
;revolves about the Earth, the waters (if any there·be) will be raifed on ·
tliis and the opprifite fide, and always continue over the fa1ne part of tbe
1\Ioon~s furface, fo that there can be no different heights of \Vater there..
arid coilfequently no tides, except what finall ones may happen on account

Of the 'V I N D S.
The '"'ind, ventus, is a fcnfiblc agitation of tl1c air) \vhercby a large
quantity thereof flo,vs in a current or ilrcam out of one place, or region,
into another. 'J'he \Vinds arc divided into perennial, Jlated, and 'twriablt.
'fhcy arc a1fo di\'idcd into general ~1nd particular. \Vit1ds perennial, or
col!flant, arc fi1cb as 4ll\\'"ays blow the fa1ne \Vay: of thcfc \vc haYe a
very notable one bet\VCCn the t\VO tr·opics,. blo,ving confiantly frotn eafr to
'vc1r, called the gt'llera/ tradt-'lt·ind. 'VindsJlated, or periodical, arc fuch
as conilantly return at certain times: filch are the fea and land breezes,
blo,vi.ng frotn fea to land in the C\"Cning, and from land to fea in the
n1orning; fuch alio are the jhijting or particular trade..'f.t:indf, v.·hich,
for certain n1onlhs of the year blow one \Yay, and the reft of the year
the contrary 'vay.. \Vinds variable, or erratic, are fuch as blow nO\V this
no\V that vvay; and are now up, no\V hufhed, \vithout any rule or regu-
larity either as to tin1e or place: fuch arc all the \vinds obferYed in the
inland parts of Eng1and, &c. though feyeral of thefe claim their certain
tin1es of the day; thus, the \.Veft \Vind is moft frequent about noon;
the fouth '\Vind in the night; the north in the morning, &c. \Vind g~­
neral, is fuch a one, as at the L'lmc time blo\VS the fame \vay, over a Yery
large traCt. of ground, ahnoft all the year: fuch only is the general trade-
'vind. But even this has ils interruption; for at land it is fcarcc1y fcnfible
nt all, as being broken by the intcrpofition of mountains, valleys, &c.
at fea, near the fhore, it is difturbed by vapours, exhalations, and parti-
cular winds blo,ving from land\vard; fo that it is chiefly confidercd as
general only at mid-fea; and even there it is liable to be ditlurbed
by clouds driving from other quarters. 'Vinds particulat, include all
others, excepting the general tradc-"\vinds. 'fhofc peculiar to one little
canton, or part, arc called topical or provincial wind.r : fuch is the north
'\vind on the weftern fide of the Alps, 'vhich does not blow above one
or t\vo leagues length\vife, and much lefs in breadth: fuch alfo is tbc-
pontias in France, &c. ·
Sorne philofophers, as Des Cartes, Rohault, &c. account for the
general wind fro1n the diurnal rotation of the earth ; and from this ge-
neral wind derive all the particular ones. 'rhe atmofphere, fay they·,
invefting the earth, and n1oving round it, that part 'vill perform its cir-
cuit fooneft \vhich has the fmalleft circle to defcribe; the air, therefore,
near the equator, will require a fome\vhat longer tin1e to perforn1 its cour1e
in, fro1n \veft. to caft, than that nearer the poles. 'fhus, as the earth

.- cccding1y 'light, are left behind; fo that, in refpe& of the Earth•s furfnce,

nion ·feems confirn1ed .by th1s; t9!tt t~1.efe winds are tound only betlveen
the tropics, ~n thofe parallels of l~t1tude wher~· the diurnal n1otion is
f"'·ifteft. But the CQnil:ant calms In the Atlantic fra near.the equator,
the \vet1erly 'vinds near the .coail: of Guinea, an.d the periodical \Veitcrly
·monfoons uncle~ the eq_uator in t~e ln~ian feas, de~]are the infufficicncy
of·this hypothef~s. Betides, ~be .air, be1n~ kept cloie to the earth by the
rrinciplc of gravJty, would, 10 tJmc, acqutre the fame degree of velocity
that the earth's furface moYcs "''ith,.. as \Yell i~ refpeCt of the diurnal
rotation as of the annual ribout the Sun/ '\vhich is abont thirty tin1cs
f'!Viftcr. D.r. 'Halley, therefore fubfritutes another caufe, capable of
prodltcing a like confiant effe~~ not liable to the L'lmc objections, but
agreeable to the kilOWll propcrtlCS of the c)einents of 'Vater itnd air., and •
the la\VS of the motion of fluid podies~ Such a one is the atl:ion of the
Sun's beams upon the air and \.Vater, as he palfcs every day oYer the occ~n,
confidered together with the quality of the foil and the fitllation of the
adjoining continents. ,
,. According to the la·\vs o.f ftatic~, the air ':vhich is.lef~ rarefied, or ex-
panded by heat, and confequcntly ts tnorc ponderous, tnuft haYe a tnotion
toV\'ards thofc parts thereof \Vhich are more rarefied, and leis ponderous,
to bring it to an cquilibriun1; alfo, the prefence of tbe Sun continually
jhifting to the \Veftward, that part to 'vhich the air tends, by reafon of
the rarefaCtion n1adc by his greateft n1cridian heat, is, \vith hin1, carriea
"\YCf~\Vard; and, confequently, the tendency of the whole body of the '
lo\ver air is that way. · Thus a general ea1ter1y "''ind is fcro1ed, \V hich,
being imprefied .o~ th~ air of a vait ocean, the ~aTts itnpeJ one the other,
and io keep movtng t1ll the next return of the Sun, \vhereby fo 1nuch o.f
the n1otion a~ 'vas loft is again reftorcd; and thu~ the caH:erly wind is ~
made perpetual. .From the fame principle it follo\vs, . that this ea_
fterly
wind fhould, on the north fide of the equator, be to th<r north\\rard of the
eafi:, and in fouth latitudes·to the fouth,vard thereof; for near .the line
the air is tnuch more rarefied than at a greateA· difrance fron1 ·it, becauie
the Sun is t\vice in a year vertical thereJ and fl,t no time diftant abo,·e
t\\"entv-three deg~~es and a half; at which di.fl:anc·e the heat, being as
the fi~e of the angle of incidence, is but little fhort of that of th~ per- ·
pendicular ray; "'~hereas, under the tropics, though the Sun flays longer
vertical, yet he is a long time forty..fevcn degrees off, \vhich is a kind of
winter, whcr~in the air io cool&, as that the fummer heat c:lnnot \Varm it
to the fitme degree \\'ith that under the equator. '\'herefore, the air
towards the noitb and fouth being }efs rarefied than that in the Inidd)e, it
follo,vs, that from both fides i't ought to tend to\yards 'the equator: ·,

furface of the globe ,,·arc fca, \VduJd undoubt~lly blo\v quite round the
'vorld, as they nrc founu to c.lo in the At1antic and Ethiopic ol·canc;.
Jlnt teeing that fo great continents do intcrpofc, and br<·ak the continuity
of tltc ocean, regard muft be hhd to the nature of the foll, ~nd the pofi-
tiou of the high rnountains, "rhich nre the t\VO principal canfcs of the
variations of the \\'ind frorn the fermer general rule; for, if a country
lying ncar the Sun prO\'C to be flat, fat1dy, and lo\V land, fuch as the
defc1 ts of Lybia arc ufually reported to be, tlu; heal occafiohcd by the
xeflcxion of the Sun's bcan1s, and the retcntiqn thereof in the h'\nd. is
incredible to thofc \\rho have not felt it; \vhcrcby the air being cxtrcn1cJy
rarefied, it is ncceflitry that the cooler and tnorc dcnfc air lhould run
thither\vards to rc1torc the equi]ibriutn. 'fhis is fuppofed to be the caufc
'vhy, ncar the coaft of Guinea, the \Vind al\V3)'S fets in upon the land,
blo,ving 'vcil:erly infi:cad of caficrly, there being fitflicicnt rca:on to be-
lieve, that the inland parts of .Atiica are prodigi9u1ly hot, Iince the
northern borders thereof were fo very intemperate, as to give the ancients
caufe to conclude, that all beyond the tropics \Vas uninhabitable by ex..
ccfs of heat.
1\ir. Clare, in his 1\Iotion of Fluids,. p. 302. n1enti~ns a fatnilar ex..
pcrimcut, that ferves to illufl:rate this n1atter, as \vell as the alternate
courfc of land and fca breezes. Fill a large dif4 'vith cold \Vater, and
in the rniddlc of it place a .,vater-platc, filled \Vith \varm \Yater: the ficil:
\vill rcprctent the ocean, the other an i11and, rarefying the air above it.
1"hcn, holding a wax-candle over the cold \Vater, blo\v it out, and the
f1nokc \vill be feen, in a frill place, to moYc to\vard the \\"arm plate, and,
rifing over, it will point the courfe of the air, and alfi> of vapour, frorn
fca to land. And if the ambient vtater be \Varmed, and the plate filled
with cold \Vater, and the fmoking \Yick of a candle held over the platc1
the contrary "rilL happen.
Frorn the fi1n1e caufc it happens, that there arc fo confiant calms in
that fame part of the ocean, called the rains; for this traet being placed
in the rniddlc, bct\veen the \Vefterly ''"inds blo\\"ing on the coafi: of
Guinea, and the eaftcrly trade-\\..inds blo\\~ing to the \VCfi:,vard thereof,
the tendency of the air here is indifferent to either, and fa fi:ands in equi-
libria bet\veen both; atid. the \\"eight of tbe in~umbent attnofpherc being
diminiihed by the continual contrary 'vinds blo""ing·frtnn hence, .is the
reafon that the air here holds not the copious vapour it receiycs, but lets
it fall in fo f~equc.nt rains. But as the cold and dcnfe air, by reafon

that tl1is latter riiuft afcenrl·ina continued ftream, as· faft as it rar~fies ; and
that, being afcerided, it mufl: difperfe itfelf, to preferve the equilibrium;
that is, by a contrary cun:_ent, the upper air tnuft move fro1n thofe parts
·wh~re the gre~tefc heat is;· fo, by a kind of .circulation, the·north-eafi:- ·
trade-wind below will be attended with-a fouth-we11:erly wind above; and

That this is more than a bare C{)njeeturc, the a1rnoft inflantaneous

but that ,vbich above all confirn~s this hypotbe1is, is the phenomenon of
· · ~he monfoons, by this means ~ Inoit eafily folved, and \Vithout it hardly
explicable. Suppofing, therefore, fuch a circulation as above, it is to be
confidered that to the nortJnvard of the·Indian o·cean there is every \Yhere
land, within the ufual limits of -the latitude of 30°~ ; viz. Arabia, Perfia-,-
India, &c. which, for the fame reafon as the 1\fediterranean parts of
Africa, are fubject' to infuflerable heats, when the Sun is to the north,

fouth-weft; and, by confequence, fometimes the under current, or \Vind,.

and the heat increafing to the foutb, the north-e~:ft \vinds ~nter, and.

N~\V, an extraordinarj fall of the 1\Iercury in the baron1etcr fho\ving
nn extraordinary lightncis of the atmofphere, it is no wonder if that fore.
tels ftorms. For, if the air be fuddenly· condenfed in any place, its
·ipring 'vill be fuddeu1y din1iniihed :· hence, if this diminution be great·
enough to affeCt the barometer, there will a vlind blo\v throngh the
~condef'1fe4_ a~r. But, fince the air cannot be fuddenly condenfed unlcfs
it have before been much ra~efied, there \vill a wind blow through the air,
as _
it cools, after having been violently heated. In like Ina~ner, if air be
.fnddenly rarefied, ,.its ipring is fuddcnly increafcd: 'vherefore? it ",.ill ,
:flo'v through the contiguous air, .not a&ed _on by tbe rarefying force.
A 'vind, therefore, will blovv ot1t of a place, in \Vhich the air is fud-
rlenly rarefied; and on this principl_
e;1 in all1:>robability, it is, that, fincc
the Sun's po\ver in tarefying the _
air, i.s notorious, it n1uft neceifarily
have a great· influence on the generation of \vinds; which Hkc,vife pe-.
netrate the very bo,vels of the earth, iince n1ofr caves and chafms are
found to en1it wind, either more or lefs. ~I. 1\Iufchenbroeck. has cuu...
merated a vatiety of cautes that produce winds, exi11ing in the bowels of
tbe earth, ·on its furface, in the atn1ofphere, and above it. See Intr. ad
Phil. Nat. vol. ii. p. 1110, &c. · ··
.
The riiing and changin~ of the 'vinds are deterfl?.ined .experimenta11y,
by means_of '\Veather-cocks, . placed on the tops of houfes, &c. But
thefe only indicate \vhat pa:q:es about their o\vn height, or near the fur-
face of the earth: 'Volfius afll.1res us, fron1 qbfcrvations of_feveral years,
that the higher winds, which drive the clouds, are different from the lower
ones, which move the weather-cocks; and Dr. Derham obferves fame-
thing not unlike this, Phyf. 'fheol. Jib. i. cap. 2. 'Iliis author alfo re-
]ates, upon comparing feveral feries of obfervations n1ade of the winds in
div·ers countries, viz.,England, Ireland, Swiilerland, Italy, France.. Ne'v
England, &c. that thewinds in thofe feveral places feldom agree; but, when_
they do, it is commoply \vhen they are ftrong, and of long continuance
in the famequarter; and more, he thinks, in the northerly and eafterly than
in any other points. A]fo, that a ftrong wind in one place is oftentimes
a \Veak one in anotherJ or moderate, according as the places are nearer or
more remote. Phil. Tranf. No. 207 and 321 •

Philofophers have ufed various methods for determining the volocity
of. the wind, which is very different at different times. The method ufed
by Dr. Derham \vas that of letting light- downy feathers fly in the wind,
and.accurately obferving the diftance to which they were carried in any
number of balf-feconds. 'This method he preferred to that of Dr.
Hooke's tnola alata, or pneumatica, (fee Phil. 1-ranf. No. 24. and Birch's

Dr. Hales found (Statical Efr. YoL ii. p:.1ge .325.) that the air ru!hed out
of a pair of fn1ith's bello\VS at th~ rate ot 08·73 feet jn a fecond of time,
'vhcn con1prefied with _
a force equal to the ,,·eight of one inch perpendi_;

'fhe velocity of the air, as it paficd ont of the trunk of his v.entilators;.
'vas found to be at the rate of three th.oufa.nd feet in.a.tninute ;.'vhich is
at the rate of thirty-four tniles in an hour. Dr. Hales :G1.ys,. that the ve-
locity with ~1iich impelled nir paiies out at any orifice, may be deter-
nlined by .hanging a light "Valve over the n0fe of a., bcllo\vs1 by pliant
leather hinges, 'vhich "\v.ill be much agitated and lifted up ~frorn a per..
pendicular to a inore than l1orjzontal poiition.by the for.ce of the ruihing
air. . rrhere. is anoth~r nlore accurate V\ray, be fays, of eftimating the.-
vclocity of air, viz.. by hol<ling the otifice of an inverted. gla1s· fiphon~

prefied in one leg, and raifed in the other, in proportion to the for.cc 'viti~
\vhich the "\Vater is impelled.by the air.
As to the quali.ties.and eftects of· the wind~ it is to oe·obferved, t1lat
a "'\Vind blo-\ying from the fea is. al,vays tnoift: in fummer, it is cold;·
and in ~vinter, 'varm, unlefs the fea. be frozen up.. 'fhis is-demonftrated~
thus: there is a Yapour continually riling oul of all "\Vater,. (as appears=
even hence, that a quantity of water, being left a little while in an open.
vefiel, is found fenfibly ·diininifued,) but efpecially if. it he expofcd to the·

By this n1eans, the air incumbent on the fea becon1es in1pregnated. 'vitl1.

thefe vapours along wi.th them ;:and confeq:uent1y they are al'\vays moift.

fore, blo\ving over the continent, carries but little vapour with it, and
is therefore dry. Farther, the earth in fun1mcr is \varmer than ,,~att,.r

heat of contiguous bodies, that oYer the earth in fun1ruer \vill be \varn&cr·

'\Vinds arc cold in \Vinter. Hence, \Vc fee why land-,vinds 1nakc clc:1r,

which is about 4 degrees farther than they extend to on the African fide;
alfo, to the !outh\\,.ard of the equator, the trade-\\'"inds extend three or four

the Sun is far fouth, the S. E.·wind gets to the eaft, and the N. E. winds .
on this fide of the equator veerp more to the north.
-
Along the coaft of Guinea, fron1 .Sierra Leona to the ifland of St. 'Tho-·
mas, u~1der the equator, which is abov~ five hundred leagues, the fouth-
ctly and fouth-weft winds blo\v perpetually; for, the S. E. trade...,vind,
having paffed the equator, and approaching the Guinea·cqaft within eighty
or a h·undrcd leagues, iriclines to\vard the fhore, and becomes fouth, then ·
S. E. and by·degrees, as it con1es near the land, it veers about to fouth~
S. S. ,V. and in with the land it isS,"\\r. and fometimes W. S. W. Tbjs

called tornadoes, blowing from all points of the horjzon.
Bet\veen the fourth and tc!tth degrees of north latitude, and be~1-veen
the longitudes of Cape-Verd, and the eafternmoft of the Cape-Verd ifles,
there.is a traCt .of fea iubject to perpetual calms, attended with frequent
thunder and lightning, and rains: fhips~ in failing thefe fix degrees., are
faid to have .been fometimes detained whole n1onths.

The three laft obfervations account for two circumftances which ma-
riners experience in failing from Europe to India, and in.the Guinea trade.
The firft .i.s,' the difficulty "\Vhich fhips, in going to the foutl~\\pard, efpe.-
cially in the months ·of July, and Auguft, find in paffing bet\veen the
coafts of Guinea and Brafi], although the breadth of this fea is more than
five hundred leagues. 'fbis h~ppens, becaufe the S. E. "vinds at that
time of the year, commonly extend fome degrees beyond the ordinary' li-
mits of four degrees N. 1atjtude; and, ·befides, coming fo n1uch foutherly, .
as to be fometimes fouth, ·fometimes a·point or two to the \Veft; it then
only remains to p1y to windward: ~nd if, on the one fide, they fteer
\V. S.'V~ they get a -vvind more and n1gre ~afterly; but then there is a
d~nger of falling in with the Brafilian coaft, or ihoafs ; and, if they fi~er
E. S: E. thej fall into the neighbourhood of the coall of Guinea. from
whence they cannot depart 'Yithout running eafierly as far as the iiland.of
-St. 'fhom~s; and, this is the conftant praCtice of all the Guinea fuips.
Secondly, all fhips departing fro_
m Guinea for Europe, their direct
courfe'is_riort~ward; but on this courfe they cannot go, becaufe, th'e coaft
bending n~arly eaft and weft~ the land _
is to the nortb.\vard: therefore, as
the "\Vinds on this coaft are gen~ra~ly betw~en the S. and W. S.W. they
are.obliged to freer S. S. E. or fouth, and with thefe courfes they run off
the ih<?r7; but, info doi~g, tlley alway~ find the 'vinds more and more con-

llaving defcribed the nature and properties of rnetcorolic appearances,
and explained the phcnotnena of cclipfc.:s, comets, &c. \Vith the motions
nnd attractions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun, as they affeCt the tides,
\vinds, nnd atmofpherc, \VC !hall no"v confider their influence, jointly
\Vith that of the ?thcr planets and fiars, in producing the continual
changes nnd mutati~ns in the general aff.tirs of fiarcs and empires; and
in the variations and changes of the \Veather, \vhereby plagues and
pefiilenccs, droughts and inundations, and the confequent calaxnities of
Jickly and di!lrefsful tin1es, are fought out and prediCted; for, all having
the fl1me primitive caufe,· nan1cly. the attraCtive po\ver and influence of
the planetary fyfien1 upon the elamentary and terrefirial rnatter, they nre
alike definable from a contemplation of ~he occult properties of thlt celefiial
influx, which this department of the afrrologic fcience has, in all ages. beell
found to teach. " ·
From what has been pren1ifed concerning the fQrcgoing phenon1ena,
it becon1es evident, that whatever affects the fiate of the air or atrnof...
phere rnuft necef!:1rjly, in an adequate proportion, alter the fiate of the
\Veather; and that, 'by ho\v much the more the e1etnents are impregnated
or charged \Vith eJearical matter, or that the n1otions of· the \vinds are
increafed or diminiChcd, or that the clouds are furcharged \Vith n1oift
and ditcordant vapours, by fo much the mor.e \Vill fl:onny, tempefluous,
and unfettled, \\'cather, be produced. So like\vife, it is equally dcmon-
Jlrable, that, ns the tctnperature of the air, and the fiate of the ambient
and elementary matter, is from time to time varied and changed, or
furchar~ed to a greater ·or lefs excefs "vith any particular quality. fo in a
proportionate degree \vill the animal funCtions and fpirits of men be raifed
or depreiTcd, their minds agitated, and their paffions inflamed; \vhencc
arifc putrid and malignant complaints throughout \Vhole provinces, and
difcord anti malevolence among the different governments and orders of
fociety. And, feeing thefe things are fo, that their caufes are brought
about by the attraction~ and mutations of the Sun, Moon, nnd St,us, in •
their different motiuns and pofitions, and in their conjunCtions and o~l­
pofitions, nnd various configurations among thcn1felvcs an~. \yith the
.Earth; and fince \Ve have ft:en that thefe motions and pofittons of the
planets, and all their different afpects, can be afcertained for any fc:rics
of years to come; fo, it is manifcfi, that, by kno,ving their influences
'"'and n'fefrs upon the air,. earth) 'vinds, and elements, and upon the

conOitutions -and pa.ffions of ·men, a prefage of times and fcafons, of
famines, -peftilences, inundations, and of all great and · univerfal calami-
-~ties arifing therefrom, is fought out, and indifputably e~abli01ed.
This [peculation-is there~ore ?e.lline<:! .to be, the ~rt ?f prog~o~icatio~ by
the rules of ajlron~iny. It 1s dtv.lded tnt? t"vo .pnnc~pal .or Jtft1ntl: parts ;
the one \Vhcreof 1s ca1led gt7[tra'l, or unz.·veifal, becaufe 1t relates to whole
c1npires, nations, or provinces; and .the other local, or p11rticula17, fince ·it
relates only to ·the u·cather applicable to particular and diftintt climates ;
\vhich, ·frotn the foregoing theory of eclipfes, tides, and .winds, it is lna-
nifc'ft, ·rn.~ght·be ~fcer.tained wi~h .very.great de.grecs of exadnefs.
,
..In thefe confidcrations, ·t\V.O ·things are to·be regarded, . as the pr.i'ncipal· .
ground-\vork of the whole, n~mely, the tendency and fanu"liarity .of the
:t\\'elve figns .of the zodiac, ana the planets arid fiars, to the temperature
of the d-
ifferent clitnt1!e·
s.; and .the quali.ties .produced in certain feafons by
the etliptical conjunctions of _the S~n ~nd Moon, an~ by the revolutions
and tranlits of the planets, with the1r nfings and fiattons. - The firft and
greater caufe hath .re~pe& unto \Vholc r~gions, and Choweth ·the uncertainty
<>f national glory and perfection, fo liable to be difiurbed by wars and in..
tefiine ~roil~, or defrroyed by famine, peftilence, earthqua·kes, or in_
undations.
The ~iecondary or inferior <7aufe is produced in certain times, as in the
contrariety of feafons, and their mutations more or lefs in 'their different
quarters_; as 'heat_s or w.inds m.ore vehement o~ ren1ifs! out of their proper
and accuftomed times, \v.hereby plenty, or fcarctty, or dtfeafes, are produced,
as the .caufe and quality !hall .happen· to be. Hence are difcovered the
rympathies exilliqg bet\tveen the motions and configurations of .the planets,
and bet~·een the nlutations and varieties of weather obfervable in tlle fanle
' feafons .of the year; and of the general good or evil attendant on mankind;
all which are· here acccounted for according to tbe principles of natural
reafon. ·For it is an undeniable fact, that e.very difiinCl: property \vill have
its difiinet efleet; and that the knowledge of thefe effeCl.s points out the
property, whether it be good or evil. Thus we kno\v that the property of -
the planets ruling particular feafons, as the Moon-does the tides, \V ill con~
ftantly produce the fame effeCt, when unimpeded with the property or
.influence of other attractive h9di~s ; for then the effective property is
.changed, and can only be determined by ·contenlplating the proper force and
.mixture of the different planets, according to their co-operation and power,
or places in t_he zodiac. ·
In this fpeculation, 1ikewife, not only the natures and mixtures of the
p:lanets.amongft themlelves are to be obferved, but alfo the mixtures of
thofc

thofe qualities \vhich communicate their properties to the planets and
Jigns: fuch as the more powerful influences of the Sun and Moon, ;nd
the parallels of attraCl:ion made with the earth. But, when any of the
planets na di!l:inCl:Jy of themfelves, regard muft foJely be had to their
own proper government and quality. Therefore, if the ftar of Saturn
rules alone, he caufeth cortuptions by cold, confpiracies rn fiates, with
difcontents and {edition. But the influx which 0 properJy fc:izeth men,.
engendering cold and crude matter, produces chronical difeafes and con-
futnptions, colloquntions, rheumatifms, cold moifi. diftempers, agucs,
epidemic fevers, defluxions, &c. \vhich wi11 be the general or prevailing
complaints in thofc countries over which this planet bears rule, and
where his para1lc1s or afpc:Ets in mundo are viubly made. With refped.
to the political government of thofe countric:s, it fiirs up dilfentions
amorigfi: kings and princes, begets viol~nce and contention betwixt ma-
gi!trates and rulers, and anarchy aQd confufion amongll: the people; it
forebodes war, forrow, and defolation, and often terminates in the over-
throw of ftates, and in the death of princes. Among irrational animals,
it moft1y feizeth thofe of the domefiic kind, p~oducing the di1lemper in
horfes and dogs, the rot in iheep, and the murrain amongl1: horned
cattle. Its effect upan the atmofphere will produce mifiy, dark, clofe,
humid; lowering, corrufcuous, weather; or e)fe turbulent, and violently
intemperate; or extremely intenfe cold, durable frofi.s, and fno\v, as the
clime and feafon of the year !hall chance to be. Hence \viJl arife inun-
dations of waters, !hipwrecks, and difirefs at fea, and dro\vning, or
freezing to death ·on land. The fruits of the earth will be diminilhed,
and chiefly thofe which are moll: needful for the fufienance of n1an \-Jill
totally fail, being firuck with blight, fmut, blail:, and milde\V, or
~vercome with floods, -rain, hail, fnow, or frofis, fo that the evil begets
a paucity of the necefl'aries of life, and proceeds to famine.

If Jupiter alone be lor'd of the year, he influences all things to the

epidemic diforders will break out amongft them, and the heat and
drought wiJI prove extremely fatal to horfes. 1..he fruits of the earth
will be burnt up, fodder and grafs for cattle every where defiroyed, and
all vegetation in a rpanner fufpended. Rivers, lakes, and ponds, will be
dried up, the fprings of the earth exhauftcd; and, at the rifi ng of the

faint; dogs \vilr run mad, and epidemic contagion fpread throughout

felicitous and happy marnages, harb1ngers of JOY, of chaldren, and de-
light. Political affairs wi11 now grow mild and peaceful; and the minds
of n1onarchs more inclined to negociations for falnily-alliances, and the
chains of wedlock, than to enforce the favage rage of war, and painful
thackles of in1prifonrnent or flavery. All animated nature will increafe
and multiply, and the ~reatures which do not fly the dominion of man
\vill be healthful and profitable. The fiate of the air \Vi11 be prolific
and ferene, tempered with refrelhing fuowers and falubrious winds,
producing heavy and luxuriant crops of all the fruits of the earth. Ships
fail brilkly ;1nd fafely at fea, and the produce of differcnt climes are \vafted
from fhore to lhore., trebling their value. The fprings and rivers murmur
through the groves, pouring over their moffy banks the beverage of fat-
nefs on the verdant plains, finiJi~g in_all the va.riegated drefs of blooming
fpring. The alternate feafons \VJll fncceed, wuhout turbulent or violent
excefs ; and th.e delicious fruits and ripened corn, gathered into the
garner in plenty and perfection, will influence the rninds of men, while
fitting in fafety and peace under their own vine and their own fig- tre~~

· When Mercury hath alone the dominion, and not allured to the qua-
lity of other bodies by the force of attraCtion, or the mutability of his
own nature, he quh:kens the minds of men, and difpcfes to indufiry and
invention. The conftitution of the air under him will be active and un- ·
fettled, frequen.tly changing in the fpace only of a fe\v hours; and, by
reafon of his proximity to the .Sun, when in his [\vifteft motion, he oc-
cafions drought, and difturbs the ambient by generating \Vinds and va-
pours, thunder, lightning, corrufcations, and dark lo\vering clouds; and
on this account he induceth corruption in animals and plants, particu-
~ar]y fuch as are troft ufeful and profitable to man. In matters of ftate-
policy and government, he infufes artifice and cunning into the conduCt
of princes, gives fagacity t9 minill:ers and difpatch to the deliberations
of council; he protnotes the liberal arts, and for\\'ards the improven1enc
of fcience, rlifpofing aU men to fobriety,., perfeverance, and labour. Jn

immoderate heights; break down their banks, and carry away their
bridges ; inundate the country for miles round, and lay whole towns
. under water; thefe again, as fuddenly fubfide, and droughts frequently
enfue. Hence the di feafes engendered will be quotidian agues, violent
colds and coughs,. eruptions of blood, afihmas, and· confumptions. In
t)le occidental quadrants h~ diminilheth the waters, and in the oriental
fte increaferh them. Under this in"fluence, therefore, when it aas alone,
.. men will experience a mediocrity of good and evil; the fruits of the earth
will in general be fufficient, but vary much in quality and value, accord-
.ing to the mutation of the weather, and as the blights and rains lhall
have been more or lefs general or partial. Peace will for the n1oft part
prevail under this governance; fince the animofities of princes will be
tnore Jikely to cool by negociation, than be inflamed or exhaufied by
the devaftations of war. .

Thus each planet, according to its nature, quality, and force, pro-
cluceth thefe things--, when left to its own proper aElion and effeB:, un-
nlixed with the intiux of other bodies, and the bean1s and copulations
of the luminaries unoppofing or correfponding thereto. But, when one. '
fiar is mixed with another by afpect, or by fatniliarity in figns, then the
effea will happen according to the tnixture and temperatnerit arifi ng from -,
the comrnunication of tbofs: mixtures, which being as it were manifold
and infinite, from the number and diverfities of other ftars and afpects,
they can only be afcertained by ~tteotive calculations,.. founded on ma-
thematical precepts. And, in o~r judgment of events which appertain
to certain difiritts, we ought moft attentively to Weigh tbefamiliaritieJ of
thofe planets which bring up the event ; for, if the planets are benefics,
and conformed to the region . upon which the etfect falls, and are not
overcome by contraries, they tnore powerfully produce the bene.fit ac..
cording to their proper nature, as, on the contrary,. they are of lefs ad..
vantage, if any impediment happens in the famili~Jrity, or their influence
be overcorne by oppofing afpetrs. So again, if the ruling ftars of the
events are malefics, and have fatnilarity vvith the regions on which the
ac~ident falls, or are overcome by contraries, they do 1efs harm; but, jf.
they have no familiarity with thofe countries, nor are overcome by them
that have familiarity therewith, they do much greater harm. As to their
effetl:s upon the difeafes of tnen, they are feized by more univerfal af-
feCtions, having the feeds thereof in their nativ!ties, and receive, by
fympathy in their conftitutions, and anore fenfible operation of tbefe ge-
neral accidents. Thefe con fiderations form the grand outline of this
department of afirology; from which particulars are alone Jdeducible.

Seeing. therefore, that this fpccu la.tion comprizes t\VO different and
difiinEl fubjetls, namely, the general fiate of the \veather; and, fecond-
ly~ the rnutations and revolutions of countries and empires: it will be
proper to confider them upon the bafis already l:tid do\vn, under their
rcfpeBive and particular heads; and, firft,
Of the vV E A T fi E R.
As it is in the air or attnofphcre that all plants and anirnals Jive and
breathe, and as that appears to be the great principle of moll: animal and
vegetnblc productions, alterations, &c. there does not feem any thing,
in aJl philofophy, of m.ore imtnediate concernment to us, than the fi:dtc
of the weather. In effect, aJI Jiving things are only alfemblagcs or
bundles of veffe)s, whofe juices are kept moving by the preffure of the
~tmofphere; and \vhich, by that motiqn, maintain life. So that any al-
terations in the rarity or denfi ty, the heat, purity, &.c. of that, m uft
neceffarily be attended with proportionable ones in thefe. What great,
yet tegular, alterations, a little change of \Veather makes in a tube filled
with mercury, or fpirit of wine, or in a piece of ftriog, &c. every body
knqws, in the common inltance of baron1eters, thern1ometers. hygro-
meters, &c. 3nd it is O\\'ing partly to our inattention, and partly to our
unequal intemperate courfe of Jiving, that we do not feel as great and as
regular ones in the tubes, chords, 3nd fibres, of our O\Vn bodies. It is
certain, a great part of the brute creation have a fenfibiJity, · and fagacity,
this way, beyond mankind; and yet_ \vithout any means or difpofition
thereto, more than we; ex~ept that their vefieJs, fibres, &c. being, in
other refpccts, in one equable habitude, the fame or a proportionable
caufe from without has always a like or proportionable effect on them;
that is, their veifels are regular· barometers, &c.· affeeted only from one
external principle, viz'" the difpofi tion of the atmofphere; \vhereas ours
are aCted on by divers from within, ·as \vell as without : fome of \vhich
check, impede, and prevent, the action of others. But to afcertain the
limits of thefe various affeBions requires atheory of the. \Veatber found-
ed on aftrological and mechanica] principles.
, .
To obtain a proper knowledge of ~he \\'Cather for any given year~
it is requifite exaaly to obferve the ingrefs of the Sun into the firft
point of Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn, at the change or com..
mencen1en t of the four different quarters of the year; togetht:r \\'ith the
conjunaions or oppofitions of the lu1ninaries next preceding the fame in-
grelfe~. Then to the time of the ingrefs erect the fcheme of heaven, and

tion or oppofition, happen in a moifi, dry, or cold, manfion; and of what
planets they are afpe8ed, and like\vife if the ruling planets be conjoined
in fuch a manfion with the lord of the fign of that conjunction or oppo-.
fition, .and the lord of the afcendarit'; as alfo the altJzuten, or general lord
of the figure, not negleCting the fixed fiars of the fidl, fecond, and thi~d,
magniturle, their rifing, fetting, and culn1inating, with planets of the fame
nature, or having conveni~ncy of afpecl o_r radiation. Alfo, diligently
confider the lord of the eclipfe, or ruling planet of the great conjunCl:ion
n~xt preceding, if any do irnmediately precede; which, being truly
noted, obferve carefully \vhat planet or fixed i1:.1r he fuall be corpo-
rally conjoined \Vith, or apply to, next after 'the conjuntl:ion or oppofition
of the Sun and Moon; for according to the nature thereof \vill the feafon
generally be inclined. If Saturn therefore be 'well difpofed in an angle,
and in a tnoifi: aHerifm, without impediment, or applying to another
planet at the time of the Sun·s ingrefs, it prefages temperate .and feafon-
able lhowers, and filleth the heaven with obfcure clouds, efpecially in that
lunation wherein he hath the chief dominion. But if, on the con-
trary, he be impedited, or evilJy difpofed, it portends turbulept fiorms
of wind and rain, and cold, denfe, and thick, clouds, efpecially if Ve-
nus, or Mercury be in moifi Jigns, and behold him froa1 an angle: for, _
i.n that cllfe, there will be much r~in. Jupiter, in fuch a pofitioJ), pro-
duceth winds and rain, with reddilh clouds; Mars engenders yello\v
clouds, thunder, corrufcations, and rain, efpecially in thofe times and
places proper and convenient, and the rather if Jupiter and Mercury give
any tefiimony tl1ereto. "rhe Sun, irradiated in that manner, produces
red ~louds and ngreat deal of wet. 1~he Moon, applying to Venus, and
afruming toe above_prerogatives, brings gentle rain; but, if the Moon ap-
plies to Mercury', or if Mercury be lord and, ruler of the figure with Jupi-
ter, it portends lhowers and violent winds, and·cloudy air; yet fon1etin1es
more violent, and fometimes more remifs, according to the figns, all:erifm,
manftons of the Moon, and the conjunCtions of the other frars, either .
fixed or erratic. And here note, tha't, if the ruling planet be _
oriental,
his effects will appear in the end; if occidental, in the beginning, whe-
ther it be in a revolution~ folar ingrefs, or a lunation.
A fcheme of the heavens, erected for the Sun's entrance into the firft
fcruple of Aries, will, with the 'help of the Moon's principal afpects
and configurations with the Sun and other planets at he~ feveral changes,
determine the general ftate of the weather for that quarter. But, in this
fpecies of prediction, \Ve muft never lofe fight of the influence and at-
traction of the earth, nor of the force and peculiarity of each c~imate

Jar fituation of different clin1ates or countries v:ith refpc:ft to the Sun, and
\Vould have their weather fixed 3nd certain, the fame as their incrcaf~ or
decreafe of d~y or night, were it not for the attratlivc and expulfive force
of the other cclefiial bodies, \\'hich are incclfantly varying that of the Sun
nnd of one another, according to their different pofitions and afpcCls.
Hence it is necelfary, before \Ve atte1npt to give jugdo1ent of the v.·ea-
ther in any particular country or climate, to be well informed of its par-
ticular fituation "'ith refpetl: to land and fea, mountains and vaJJies,
.ifiands nnd continents, caverns and lakes, as well as of its geographical
pofition, with refpet't to the tropics, equinoClial, ecliptic, &c. for, as
every different climate is differently affeC.lc::d by the Sun's influence upon
it, ns well as by the quality of its own· proper foil or cornponent parts,
fo will the atlion of the other celefiial bodies thereupon be more po\\·er-
ful or remifs, as their nature and quality tha11 be found to agree \vith or
oppofe the fiate and ternperature of thofe climates, and the Sun's influence
at thofe times upon the1n. Hence we fee clearly the extreme difficulty
of calculating the weather for England, Ireland, or any of the iflands,
\vhich, being furrounded by the fea, are fubject to tnuch greater varia4
tions of weather than any of the continents or great oceans. The
caufe is apparent. In England, we llnd almoll: every flight configura-
tion of the Snn and M~on, and the rifing and fetting of particular tlars,
\vill change the fiate of the atmofphere almoft infinotaneoufiy; and, from
the proximity of the fea every way round us, and the confequent moift
vapours inceffantly drawn up into the air by the attraCl:ion of thefe bodies,
we become fubjeCl: to wet, cloudy, corrufcuous, \veather, \vhich extends
~ot to any of the furrounding coafi~, but is peculiar only to the jflaod
over which thefe vapours are engendered. And, hence it is \Ve fo often
fee ilio\vers, \vhich, though accompanied \Vith violent thunder, lightning,
wind, and hai1, nre frequently not beard of at a few miles dill:nnce; and that
when, in one 'county, there has been a drought, and the land and corn
almoft dried and parched up, in the next adjoining county they lhall be
vifited \Vi th freC} uent lho~vers, and the fruit s of the earrh be 1uxuriant
and flouriihing. '1 his faCl: rnufi be within every nlJn's obfervation \Vbo
refides in England, and the caufe is entirely peculiar to the country. 'rhc
n1oifi vapours of the contiguou~ ocean are dra\vn up into the clouds one
hour ; and, by the oppofing influence of fome planet or fl:ar then ri fi ng
or culo1inating, are driven do\vn the next; \Vhence it is obviou~~ thlt all
attempts to foretel {uch mutations and chnng~s as theft: are ab{urd and
futile. 'I he object of this part of Afi:rology n1e:1ns only to afct:rtain thofe

{hall clothe the whole face of nature with fl~ecy fnow or hoary froft;

or, from humidity and heat, alall either parch the land, \vhile its fdint-
ing inhabitants gafp for breath, or putrefy its air with peftilential quali-
ties, which ~fends thcrn by thoufands to the grave. ·
The next thing to be confidered in relation to the weather, is the con-
junctions and afpects of the planets. The conjunction of Saturn and Ju-
piter, which ought accurately to be obferved, produces its effeCts in the
1nutation of the air n1any days before and after, in regard of the tardinefs
' of their motions. This conjunCtion happening in hot and dry 01anfions, .
or with fixed fta.rs of that nature, _generally produces drinefs ; increafeth
heat in futnn1er, and mitigates the· cold in winter; but in snoifi figns
it portends rain and inundations. Yet this is diligently to be noted, tbat
the efftas produced by this conjunBion will ~e of the nlture of the rul-
ing planet ; for, if Saturn claims .principal dominion in the place of the
c;onjunBion, and is ele\•ated above Jupiter in refpeCt of latitude, it denotes
n1any difeafes, and much evil in general;. but the contrary, if Jupi-
ter prevails. So likewife thefe t-wo ponderous planets being in oppofition,
quartile, trine, or fextile, is a fign of continuance of feafons; but for
the moft p~rt they bring forth impetuous ·fiorms of rain and hail; parti-
cularly ha.ppening in the fpring time, in moift afterifn1s, they produce tor..
bulent air; in fum mer, hail and thunder; in autun1n, \\1
inds and wet; in
winter, obfcure and thick clouds, and dark air. .Saturn and l\1ars in .
conjunction, quartile, or oppofition, and Jupiter giving _
teftimony, ufu-
ally prefage \vinds and rain, hail, thunder, lightnings, and corrufca.:.
tions, accordi11g to the feafons of the year; for, in the fpring it portends ,
wind, rain, and thunder; in fummer, hail and thunder; in autumn, via..
lent rain; and in winter, dirninution of cold. But above all, obferve the
ruling planet, and, according to his nature judge. Saturn and the Sun in
conjunCtion, quartile, or oppofition, is apertio pottJrUm, efpecially if it
~appens in a 1n~ift confiellation; for then, in the fprif!g time, it threa-
tens dark and heavy clouds; in fummer, hail, thunder, and remifiion of
heat'; in autumn, rain and cold; in winter; froft, fnow, and cloudy
weather. Saturn and Venus in conjunction, quartile, or oppofition,
generally produce cold rain and !howers; in fpring, ~they bring forth
rain and cold ; in fuaHner, fudden and hafty thowers; in autumn,, cold
rain, (as,_in fpring or \Vinter, fnow or cold rain.) Saturn, and Mercury
in conjunction, quartile, or oppofition, in dry figns and manfions, bring
forth drinefs; in moift figns, rain ; in the airy, winds; in the earthy,
cold

cold air and drinefs ; particularly in the: fpring, it produces \Vi nd and
rain; in ftunrner, wind and (ho\vers; in autumn, \vind and clouds;
and, in winter, wind and fno\v. Saturn and the Moon, in .conjuntlion,
quartile, or oppofition, affeCt the air according to that part of the afterifn1
\vhercin they ~re conjoined or afpcCl:ed. In the moift figns, it portends
clouds and coldnefs; in the airy, and in Sagittarius and Capricorn, it in-
crc:afeth cold, efpecially when the Moon is of full light; and, \vhen lhe
is void of courfe, it brings forth drinefs; but, iu dry figns, it begetteth
!harp air; and a frofiy feafon, if it be in \Vinter; generally the Moon and
Sa turn fiir up thick clouds and gentle !bowers. ln the fpring it is a
fJgn of n turbid and n1oifi: air; in fun1mer, tnoifiure, with remiffion of
heat, and fometimes hail, if there be any afpect of Mars or Mercury ;
in autumn, it prefages a cloudy air; in winter, clouds and fnow, with
vehen1ent cold.
Jupiter and Mars, in conjund:ion, quartile, or oppofition, change the
quality of the air, according to th·e nature of the figns and fiars to which
they are conjoined or otberwife afpeCled. In hot and dry manfions, it
caufeth great heat; in the moift figns, thunder and rain; but, particularly
in the fpring tirne, it produceth winds and turbulent air; in fummer,
heat, and thunder and lightning; in autumn, tempefi:uous and \Vindy
air; and, in winter, remiflion of cold and temperature of air. But, in
this conj untlion, we muft obferve the ruling planet; for, ·if Jupiter lha11
rule and be elevated above Mars, it fignifies much good and felicity, plenty
of fruit, and fuch things as ferve for the fufienance of mankind, accord..
ing to his benevolent nature; but, Mars ruling, produceth 1nany difeafes,
drinefs, houfe-burnings, and the like. A1fo, Jupiter and Mars, \Vi[h tenl-
pefiuous ftars, as Ar:l:urus, t~e Eagle, Tail of the Dolphin, light ll:ar of
the Crown, &c. fiir up \Vind and hail, and in fu1nn1er alfo thunder;
in v.'inter, he inclinetb the air to warmth, efpecially if Jupiter be then
fiationary. Jupiter and the Sun, in conjunction, quartile, or orpofi-
tion, bring forth \Vholefonle winds and fcrenity; particularly, in fpring
and autun1n, they t]gnify \Vinds; in fuanmer, thunder, and, in \Vinter, n:-
n1iffion of cold. Jupiter and Venus, in conjuntlion, quartile, or oppofi-
tion, do gencra1ly produce ferenity and temperature of air; in the n1oift
figns they protnife gentle lhowers; in· other figns, fair \Veather, \Vholc:!on1e
\Vinds, and fertility of all things. Jupiter and Mercury, in conjunflion,

ti'o portarUIJJ to winds and rain; in the fiery figns they bring drinefs and
warm winds; in the airy figns, fair \\'eather, but \vinds in all feJfons of

hey alter the weather, according to the. quality of the fign and atl:erifn1
which they poffefs; but at all rin1es they generally denote a rnild and
temperate f~afon.
Mars and the Sun, in co~jundion, quartile, or oppofition, in the fiery
figns, portend heat and drinefs; in the watery, hail, thunder, and light-
ning; in the n:iry, clouds; and, in the earthy, violent winds; in the
fpring and autumn, they excite dry winds; in fun1mer, great heat, light-
ning, and thunder; and, in winter, ren1iffion of cold. Mars and Venus,
in conjunCtion, quartile, or oppofition, are apertio portarunz to 1nuch
rain; if it happen in moifl: figns, efpecially in fpring and atJtutnn; in
fummer it engendereth fhowers; in \vinter, remiflion of cold, yet ·o~­
tentimes fno\v \vhen Saturn be·holds then1. Mars and Mercury, in
conjunction, quartile, or oppofition, in \Vinter and fpring, foretel fnow ~
in futnmer, thunder and hail; in autumn, hail and great winds; and,
in fiery and dry figns, they prefage warmth and exceffi.ve drinefs. Mars,
and the Moon, in conjunction, quartiJe, or oppofition, in n1oift figns,
detnonfrrate rain; in fiery, drinefs, red clouds, and fornetimes rain; in
fummer, lightning, hail, and corrufcations. Mars, entering new figns,
very often changeth the air; fo Mars, paffing by Suculce, or Hyades, cau-
feth clouds and moifture. Mars in Cancer, with ,north latitude, in au-
tucnn and winter, bringeth \Varm \Veather, with wind and and rain, and
··.!harp difeafes, if Mars ihall afpect Saturn, Venus, or Mercury. Mars
paffing by th~ Pleiades n1aketh a cloudy feafon, andJ being accompanied
\Vith frars of a tempeftuous nature, as Araurus, the Eagle, bright ftar of
the Crown, Bull's eye, Tail of the Dolphin, Procyon, Fidicula, Scorpi-
on's Heart, Virgin's Spike, &c. rifing or fetting tvith thern, fignifies a
turbulent, windy, and oftentitnes a fultry and unwholefome, air.
The Sun and Venus in conjunCtion commonly produce moifture; in
fpring and autumn, rain ; in fumm'er, QloWers and thunder; in winter~
rain. 1-he Sun and Mercury in conjunction, in the airy figns produce
\Vinds, in the watery figns rain, in the fiery drinefs and warm \\'inds,
(hurtful to mankind.) The Sun and Moon, in conjunClion, qu~rtile,
vr oppofition, in moift figns, portend rain; in fiery figns, fair weather, ..
but generally it alters the air according to the nature of the ruling planet
and the nature of the feafon. 1'he conjunCtion, femi-fextile, and (ex-
tile, of Venus and MercuryJ infer ftore of winds, and wet; and, in
\vinter, fnow; provided they be altnoft equal in motion; Venus in the

tC'rids anuch rain; if he be in the houfc of Saturn, it !hews but little; in
others, but a n\ediocrity. In the revolution of the year, \vhen Venus.
Mercury, and the Moon, are found in moift man fions, it portends much
rain. At the ingrefs of the Sun in tropical figns, if Venus (haJJ afpcct the
Moon from a n1oifl place, it is a token of n1uch rain, or, if Mars from
Scorpio lhall afpeet Venus, it portends_likewife rain. When the Sun is
in Aries or 'T'au rus, i f Vcnus be then retrogr;1dc, the fpring \Vi Jl be
n1oifl:. 1 he Sun in the tenus of Mars increafeth the heat in fummc.-r,
end drinefs of the fprings 'in winter. In the conjunCtion or oppofition
preceding the entrance of the Sun into Aries, and al fo in the ingrcfs it-
felf, if the l\1oon behold Saturn, and both be in moifi figns, it is the
pre(age of thick clouds, or foft and gentle lhowers continuing long;
but, if Venus or Mercury behold Saturn, then the rain will be tnorc:
vehen1ent, and of )ong continuance.
If, in the autumnal quarter, more retrograde planets be \Vith the Sun
than in the other feafons, \vbich in the \Vin ter following \Vill become di-
rect, it is a fign of great drinefs. When the Sun enters the eighteenth de-
gree of Scorpio, if Mercury be in a n1oifl: place, it is a fign of rain; and
obferve alfo the pt1nct that is then abnuftll of the figure ereaed for that
moment, and pronounce judgment according to his n1ture and polition.
Venus in \vinter, direEl and oriental of the Sun, fignifies but little rain
in the beginning of \V inter, and anore t1ore towards the end. \Vhen
Venus applies to Mars in Scorpio, it brings rain itntnediately. \Vhen
the Sun, !Vlcon, Venus, anci 1\llercury, are all conjoined together, it ar-
gue~ continual iliowers that dly, if the Moon beholds thean from fome
other place, or if lhe be in oppofition to thern. When at the time of
the conjunCtion or oppoiition of the lun1inaries, Venus lhall be in an an-
gle, it is a certain fign of rain; the lord of the afcendant in. a \Vatery
fign begetteth rain.
~·o detern1ine j udgmcnt of the porticular ftate of the air, we mull con-
fider thefc fix things: firll, at the tin1e of the conjunEiion, quartile, or
oppofition, of the 1uminaries, to obferve the planet that is lord or almu-
ten; for, according to his quality and nature, \vill the feafon be inclined.

afpea. And, lafl:ly, to confider to which of the planets, or fixed ftars,
the lord is firft joined, or of whom he is· beheld. Thefe things . being
well confidered, judgment may be given as follows~ nan1ely, if the lord
of the conjunCtion, quartile, or oppofition, be of a moifi nature, and the
planets in rnoift places, and the faid lord alfo be joined to fl:ars or planets
of a moifi nature, and the Moon_after feparation fhall conjoin or have af-
petl with a moift -
planet, the nature of the titne will be wet and rainy ;
if all incline to drinefs, it will be dry; if to \varulth, pronounce ha.t
weather; if to cold, cold weather. The nature of the time \Vill then
chiefly be moved, \vhen the l\Joon, after conjunaion, quartile, or op-
pofition, 1l1all be conjoined by body or any firong afpeB: to the figni-
ficator. And, when th~ Moon comes to the fign afcending of the con-
junaion, quartile, or oppofitio·n, the time \vill be changed according to
the quality and nature of the fign and afterifm.
Daily experience lhews, that the weather is much varied by·the fitua-
-tion of the winds ; for, according to their different bearing is the feafon
much inclined, fometimes to hail, rain, and fnow, and again to fair
weather; wherefore I thall ftate tbofe afpec1s which are found to attraB:,
raife, vary, or alter, the pofition of _
the winds, as they alternately rife or
fet in parallels to the different bearings of the earth~ Befides the[e,
there are the lateral and collateral winds blowing between thefe points,
which partake more or lefs of the quality of the foregoing, as t~ey ap--
proach or recede·from them. In the figure of the Sun's ingrefs into any
of the cardinal figns, or conjunCtion or oppofition of the lutninaries
preceding, or monthly lunatioo, obferve carefully what planet is predo-
minant in the figure; and ·their pofitions one to another mutually, as
before ftated, \Vill give a near conjecture of the wind.
Saturn is the mover of the eafiern winds, Jupiter of the northern,
Mars of the wefl: and fouth, Venus of the fouthern, and Mercury ac-
cording as he fhall be conjoined with others; the Sun and Moon of the
wefiern winds. 'fhe quality of the winds, and their bearing, is alfo
known from their pofitions in the figure i for, the planets with ~latitude
and fouth declination, from the mid-heaven, move the fouthern winds
to blow. From the i11zu11J cceli, with latitude and northern declination,
the northern winds; the oriental planets move the eafiern winds, but
the occidental the wefiern winds; and, when they are weak, they attratl
or caufe the intermediate winds to blow.
Alfo the fituation and ql;Jality of the winds are gathered from the lati-
tude of the Moon, as ihe inclines to the north or foutb; {o the figns do

nlfo den1onfirate the winds: for Aries, Leo, and Sagittary, excite the
north· welt winds; Taurus, Virgo, nnd Capricorn, the foutl1;eafi ; Ge-
mini, Libra, and Aqu~rics, the north-eall; Cancer, Scorpio, and Pifces,
the fouth- \Veft. Like,vife, from the application of Mercury to the othc:r
planets, \Ve may in fome meafure prognofiicate the quality of the wfnds;
for, if Mercury apply to Saturn, it produces great winds, clouds, and
rain; if to Jupiter, n1ild \Vinds; if to Mars, \-Varm \vinds; if to Mars
and the Sun, warn1 and hurtful winds; if to Venus, cold winds.
Alfo the rifing, culminating, and fetting,. of the fixed frars, with the
Sun) Moon, and other planets, alter the !late of the winds in the follow-
ing manner: Regulus, or the Lion's Heart, fetting \Vith ·the Sun, excites
the \vefi winds to blow many days together. 'fhe rifing of Pleiades \vith
the Sun moveth the eafi \Vind. The fetting of· ArElurus fiirreth up the
(outhern \vinds. The {etting of Pleiades \Vith the Sun excites the north-
eafi wind. The rifing of the Dolphin \vith the Sun alfo produceth wind.
The rifi'ng·or fetting of Ardurus, (the head of the former twin,) the
fouthern belly of Pifces, the ftar of the 'friangle, with the Suo, Saturn,
Jupiter, Mars, or Mercury, begetteth \vinds. The fetting of Hyades
troubleth both fea and land, efpecially wben Mars and Mercury give
tefiin1ony. If, at the time of the matutine fetting of the Dolphin, there
be fhowers, there \vill be none a.t the rifing of ArCl:urus. The riling of
the Haedi produces rain. The matutine rifing of the greater Dog beget-
teth heat, troubleth the feas, and changeth all things.
The great Ptolomy, from many years obfervation, deduced the folJo\7-
ing effects from the fixed fiars riling with. the Sun. Orion's Girdle, rifin()'
with the Sun, n1aketh a turbid air. Tbe fetting of the Cro\vn pre~
fageth tempefis. Syrius and AquiJo, riling in the evening, produce tem-
pefis. .The fetting of Regulus caufeth the north. \Vind, and fornctin1es
alfo rain. The fetting of the Do1phin produces \Vind and fno\v. The
fetting of Vind.emiator moveth the north-eafl: wind. The riling of the
Ram's...Horn brings forth rain and fnow. 'The vefpertine ri13ng of Arc-
turus portends tempefts. The riling of the Pleiades n1aketh the \Veft
wind to blo\v. The vefpertine fetting of Syrius produceth the fouth

fageth rain and the fouth \•;ind. The vefpertine fetting of the Pleiades
nloves the fouth wind, terminating in the weft. The riling of the Suc-
culre brings rain. 'fhc rjfing of Orion n1aketh the \Veil: wind to blO\V~
The n1atutine fctting of ArCturus pro1nifcth g,ood weather. The n1atti-

fnow, as alfo with the tail of the Goat and head of MeduCt. His riling
\Vith 'Aldebaran and the ftars of Orion moveth wind, rain, thunder. and
lightning. When he rifeth with the cloudy O:ars in Leo, wi_,.th Orion~
with the tail of ~eo, the light ftar of Hydra, the Crown, or the ll:ars
in the forehead of the Sc9rpion, it portends a cloudy feafon. The

with the fiars of the nature of Saturn, he produceth cold rain. or fno\v;
wjth the $tars of Venus, rain and moifiure; with the ftars of Mars,

whether it be fair or foul; but, if it.fhifts often in changing its pJacc-, it
prefageth rain quickly after to enfue; but, in ti1nes of frofi, it is a fign
that the \Veather is about to break.-Whirlwinds prediEl approaching
fiorrns of. rain and hail·;. thefe w.inds are kno~n by raifing the dufl: or
any light n1aterials, and they are oftentime$ fore~unners of great tem-
pefis, for it· is a \Vindy exhalation driven obliquely. upon.the horizontal
plane, and forced down by the coldnefs or moillure of the lower region.;
this repercufiion of the air caufeth chin1neys to finoke \vhich do not at
other times, and forclhews great \vinds.-Sometirnes whirl\viods are

-Thunder and lightning in winter in hot climates .is ufual, and hath

Such \Vas the pofi~ion of t~e he~vens a.t the time of the Sun's en..
trance into the firft potnt of Anes, be1ng the commencement of the fpring
or vernal quarter of 1789, whic~ happe~e? !hat year on the 1
9 th of
March, at 15 h. 52 m. or, accord1ng to CIVIl tsme, at fifty two minutes
paft three o'clock in the morning of the 2oth day, for which the above
fcheme is accurately calculated. ·
In drawing judgment of the !l:ate and temperature of the weather from
this figure, \Ve muft not only confider the afpeCts and configurations of
the luminaries and planets, but note the quaJity of the figns and tripli-
cities \vherein they are pofited, and what will be the chief or predomi"'!' ·
nant influence of the fuperiors. After which, the afpeCl:s o1uft be regu...
larly fet do\vn in fucceffion til1 the commencement of the next enfuing
quarter, when a figure of that ingrefs muft alfo be calculated, and con..
fidered in.. the lame n1anner as the preceding, together with the place of

weather \vill be pretty accurately afcertaincd, for any length of time that
the calculation is 1nade.
At the comn1encement of the (pring quarter, we find the cold ponde .
rous planet Saturn jufl: depattcd from an almoft abfolute rule and govern-
ment in the watery fign Pifces, and in no afpect either "'ith Jupiter or
the Sun. This is a demonfirable proof of the inteofe coldnefs of the pre-
ceding quarter; for, fince Saturn is of a hardening allringent nature, the
waters n1ufi be congealed, and a cold durable froft evidently dillingui!hed
the commencernent of the year 1789. But the cafe \Vas materialJy dif-
ferent towards the approach of the verna] equinox, when the Sun entered
jnto the fign Aries; at which time the cold influence of Saturn \vas mi-
tigated by a trine afpeEl of Jupiter, and by the encreafing fi:rength of
the bean1s of Sol. Neverthelefs, fince there are five p1anets configurated
in \Yatery f1gns, and the influx of Saturn not entirely abated, and alfo,
fince \Ve find the preceding provential Full Moon in &t watery fign, \Va
fafely concluded that the fpring .quarter muft for the firfi part be cold
and wet; the wind, leaning mofiJy to the north and eaft, occafioned fleet,
nnd fnow or hail intermingled with rain; towards the middle, \Vefierly
gales of wind, and fiorms of rain and hail; but n1oderate to\vards the
end, \Vith the. \Vind moftJy do\vn to the fouthern point of the con1pafs.
The follo\ving afpects) particularly of the Sun and Moon, will lhevv the
precife variations and general inclinations of the \veather on each of thofe

of the figns \vherein thefe afpeCls are 1nade, and judge of them according
to the following rules, \\'hich, fron1 obfervation and experience, are
found pretty correct. ·
The fign Aries al\vays inclines to thunder and haiJ, becaufe of its equi-
noxial prefence; but the divifions thereof caufe fomethiog rnore or lefs,
according to the nature of fixed fiars that are in Aries; for its fore-
parts 010Ve fllOWers and v.·inds; the middle partS are temperate; the
latter parts are hot and pell:ilential. Moreover, the northern parts are·
hot and corruptive; the fouthern, freezing and cold. Taurus partici-
pates of both te1npers, and is fomewhat"\V~rm: the fore· parts, and chiefly
about the Pleiades, produce earthquakes, clouds, and winds; the middle
parts n1oill:er and cooler; the latter parts and about the Hyades are .fiery,
and caufc lightning and thunder. Further, its northern parts are tem-
pernte; the fcuthern, diforderly and moveable. Gemini is generally
.temperate: the firfi parts ll)Oifl: and hurtful, the middle parts temperate.
the latter parts are n1ixed and diforderly. !vloreover the northern parts
create earthquakes and \vind; the fo·uthern are dry and burning. Can-
cer is gentle and warn1 ·: the firft p1rts and about the Prrefepe are fuffo-

'fhe fignificators which take precedence in this departn1ent of the oc-
cult fcience, and the governing afpects, having already been amply ex-
plained, it will in this place be only neceifary to lay down the general
ground ~f its· theory, and to offer fome recent exampJes in jull:ification
of its practice, and in proof. of its utility. .
After the impreffive influx of the planetary configurations, the uni-
yerfal and particular effeets of comets, eclipfes, and great conjunctions,
are .next to be confidered in this {peculation. Comets, indeed, rarely
appenr; but, whenever they do, fome great and ligna] event has always
been remarked to follow, and of the nature and quality of thofe figns
and Jnanfions of the heavens where they fonn perfect afpetl:s with the
earth;- but which is moil fenfibly felt in thofe countries or fi<ttes t<?
which the nucleus· or tail of the comet is at thofe titnes apparently di-
"~tled. 'fhere the particular effea becomes univerfal, and overfpreads
that whole region \Vith dt{olation_
, difordcr, or farnine, according to the
ftate and quality of the comet, and its pafition with regard to the Sun.
'fhe manifefiation of its e.ffeEl will be in proportion to its proximity to
ihe earth ; and 'the revolution or event will i[nmediately fo1low. Hence,
\Ve have feen recorded the unhappy defolation of whole provinces, either
qeluged by inundations of water, engendered and {ent forth fron1 the .

lienee the depopulntion of fiates, the extirpation of whole families, of
difcontcnts and infurr~C\ions an1ongll: the people, and finally a change in
tJ1c politics nnd governrnent of the country.
·1 he influence of Eclipfcs upon n1undane affc1irs l1as been much
quenioncd by fome tnodcrn nuthors of no {mall \Veight in the literary
Jcnle j but 1 beg lt"ave to remark, that the n1ofi perfect of human beings
are at befl: but imperfeCt, lnd confequently fubjcet to be f\vaycd by pre-
judice, and to adopt falfe notions of whatever doclrines they oppofe.-
'fhat fuch is the cafe \vith thofe authors \vho deny the force of ecJipfes..
requires nothing n1ore than unprejudiced enquiry and experimental ob-
fer\'ation to p.rovc. The precifion with 'vhich they are foretold, and the
farniliarity of their phenomena, fcen1s to ]eff"en their importance, and to
take off frotn their external avvfulnefs and grandeur; but their effect
upon the 2tnbient, and confequently upon the aft~irs of the world, \viii
be ever found to remain the fame.
1~he effects of ec1ipfes arife not merely from the obfcuration of light,
btlt frotn.their pofition, the quality of the figns wherein they fall, and
of the fignificators \Vith \vhich ·they are conjoined. Hence their confi-
deration is diverfe, of \Vhich one is 'local, and by it \Vc knov1 over v;hat
countries eclipfes will happen, and the !lations of the in1pulfivc planets
aCling \Vith them, \\'hich \viii be either Saturn, Jupiter, or lVlars, \\·hen
ftationary; for then they are fignificative. Another confideratjon is teJ::-
poral, by \Vhich \\'C know the time \vhen the event prefaged \vill happen,
and how long its effeCt will continue. Another is gEneral. as in \Vhat
~ind or quality the event \vi11 be cornprehended. And laflly, JPtcJ:;z/, by
which is forekno\vn what the event lhall be that .\viJI happen. To digeil
thefe feveral fpeculations, we muft careful1y coni!der the ec1iptical place
of the zodiac, and the countries or ftates \vbich~ according to that place,
have familiarity vvith the Trigon; for thofe will unquefl:ionabJy be moil:

.The fec.ond conlide_ration is .temporal, by which .we know the time·
\vhen the events ihall happeh, and hp\v long th.ey vrill continue. 1·his
\ve furvey after the following manner. 1~ eclipfes -\vhicb are made at the
fan1e time, feeing they do not fall every where alike, nor fultain ·univer··
't{llJy tbe fame degrees of obfcuration, nor continue alike in point of tinle
nt any two given places; it is neceffary to ereCt a figure under the eleva-.
tiori of the pole of that particulat place for which its effetl is to be cal-
cula.ted. By means of this, we exaClly fee the beginning, middle, and end;
of the e~lipfe, nnd the content of its duration; by whic~ the time is
}~no,vn \Vhen the portended event will begin to happen. If the eclipfe ·
be of the Sun, {o mahy years ate allowed for the event as the ohfcuration
~eafured hours; but, if an eclipfe of the Moon, infiead of years fo n1any
n1o.n"ths are to be accounted; becaufe_of her proximity to the earth; and
quicker influence. The beginning of ~he evellt and the general intention
are kno\Vn frpnl t_
he fituation of the eclipfe with refpect to the ecliptical.
line", and the angles of th·e figure. If the middle tin1e of a folar eclipfe.
falls in or near the afcending hprizon, its effect \vil~ begin to app~ar, in
that country over which it is elevated, in the firfi: four months after its.
app~arance; but its greateft effe~ will happen in the firfl: tbir9-part of
that- given time. Should the middle time of the Sun's eclipfe fall in or
near t"he midheaveo, the event will ~ot begin till the fecond four-months1
and the intention or grand effe~ will not take place till the fecond third-
part of the time given• . And fo likewife, if the middle of the eclipfe
happens in or near the weftern horizon, the effeCt will take place in the
t.hird four-.months after, and its intention or greater force in the _laft
third-part. thereof. But, in eclipfes of the Moon., the time is equated
differently:; for, if they happen in or near the eall:ern horizon, their ef...._
feet will fall upon the pla.ce over which they are elevated almoft imme-
diately; and, if in or near the nleridian, within a week or ten days; or,
if in.or: near the weftern horizon, t!len their influence will be felt within a,
fortnight or twenty days after; and the general intention or moft vifibJe.
influence will ·in ~acb cafe almoft infiantaneoutly fucceed•

h.,ppcns to the ecliptic line, the more forcibly will this influence and
cflt:Ct be found to opcrJtc. So like\vifc the planets or llars, concerned
in the influence of eclipfes or other configuration~, happening in 3n ori-
ental quarter) bring a 1nore in1medbte appearance of its effect; \vhile an .
occid~ntal pofition retards and keeps it off. After the farne manner, by
obfcrving the ccliptical ne\v and full Moons, and their quJrtile afpeas,
and ho\v they unite \\'ith or behold the principal place or n1edium of the
cclipfe, the P'rticuJar tinlcs in \vhich the effeCts of cclipfes \vill increafc
or diminifh are fought out and difcovered. According to \vhich \vc find,
thnr, \\hen ll:ars erncrgc, or are relieved from the ol>fcuration of the Sun-
bcan1S, and incrcafc in light and rnotion, their influence and po\VCr in-
cr('afes; but, \Vben a planet is ftationary, and flo\v of motiofJ, they caufe
the greater intention of the accident. And hence it is that Saturn )lnd
Jupiter, being flo\vcr of motion than the refi of the planets, have much
n~orc ~nfluence and power upon the particles floating in the ambient, and
confequently upon the minds and paffions of men.
The third confideration is to define what kind or fpecies -tviJJ {uff~r
under the efFe(.ts; and this is judged from the form of the figns and their
property; and fr_om the .quality of the fiars~ both fixed and \vandering,
that are pofited 1n the itgn where the echpfe happens, or in the anolc
preceding. The Almtiten, or lord of the cclipfe, is thus to be co;fi_
dered, and n1ay be thus taken : of the wandering tlars, \vhich ever hath
moil affinity to the place of the eclipfc and angles of the figure, and ap-
plies or recedes, according to vicinity and appearance; hath n1ore re-
fpe& to thofe that have fan1iliariry of afpect, and is either lord of the
houfes, trigons, exaltations, or terms; iuch alone· i~ to be conll:itut~d
lord of the eclipfe. But, if feveral planets "are found nearly equal ~nd
alike in power, We e)etl him to the don1inion \Vhich is mofi angular, or
that hath greater fan1iliarity of action. So far it is the rule \Vith the pla.
nets. But of the fixed fiars, \Ve chufe the brigbtefi of the firfi: magni-
tude, \vhich at the time of the eclipfe hnth comn1erce \Vith the preced-
ing angles, and j s neareft to the ec1iptica) conj unCl:ion. \Ve a1fo prefer
that \Vhich at the ecliptic hour is in a vifi ble fituat ion, either rifing \vi th,
or cultninating upo~, the angle {ucceeding to the pl.tce of ~be cclipfc.
-By the quality ot thefe, and the figns \vberein they fall, are for the
moft part judged the kind and quality of the accident portended. If
they fall in figns of human fhape, the effeCl:s \Yil1 fall on the hun1an fpe-
cies; but, if they are not of human lhape, but of tcrrcllrial, or four-
footed, it is evident th.e n1isfortune will fall upon that fpecies of 3ni1nals.
- If the fiars and conftellations partake of their nature, \Yhich fly the do-
minion of n1an, evil \vill occur by their means; but, if the affinity be by
No. SS• 12 E 1
thofe
.AN ILL US T R AT I o·N
thofe which are· fubfervient to man's ufe, it argues the evil will arife
thro~ugh them, as a murrain, rot1 or epidemic difeafe. Moreover, if the
. ruling places fall in or near the Eagle, or fimilar confiell~tions, the evil
will fall on volatiles, and fuch chiefly as are apt for the food and fufte-
nance of man; but, if they fall in or near the Dolphin, ·the effetl:s will
happen at fea, and defi:ruCl:ion is portended to the fleets and navies of that
country over \Vhicb the influence bears the greateft rule. If they happen
in tropical or equinoCtial figns, the evil comes by intempe\rate feaions,
and by inundations of many waters. If in the 1nidheaven, they threaten
evjl,to the reigning powers of that country over which they prefide •
and a vifib1e alteration either in its government or laws commonly hap-
pens. But the quantity or importance of the event is known fro~ the
greatnefs of "
the obfcuration, confidered with regard to the fignificators
or ru1ing planets which have dominion wi~h the eclip{e. For occidental
configurations made tq folar eclipfes, or oriental to lunar, dimini{h the
effeCts; whereas, on the contrary, oriental afpeets made with folar
eclipfes, and occidental with lunar, greatly augment them•
..
The fourth and laft confideration is, the knowledge and prefcience of
~he effetl:t whether good or evil ; and this we know, from the virtue of
~he fiars ruling or claiming dominion over the principal places of the
figure; and, froln the mixture which t~ey have with each other, and with
the influences of the eclipfes over which they have dominion. For the
Sun and Moon, as it were, rule and g~vern the fiars; becaufe they have
a certain power and dominion over them. And the {peculation of the
mixture of the ftars, as they are fubordinate to each other, manifefis the
quality of their effeCt; and hence it is that the effective power is deduced,
\vhether good or bad, from the temperature of thofe fignificators which
hold the dominion and produce the effect, agreeable to _the1r own yroper
nature .and quality, as hath been heretofore abundantly ffiewn.
. .
'fo reduce what has been {aid into pratlical obfervation, we will re-
vert back to the foregoing fcheme or figure of the heavens, erected for
the Sun,s entrance into Aries, in the fpring of the year 1789. The figns
and .fignificators in this horofcope are to be confidered in the fame man-
ner' and with tbe fame quality and influence, as in a nativity ; only their
properties, inftead of being applied to the faculties· of an individual, are
to be con:fidered as the reprefentatives of Princes and States, and ·holding
the refpeClive influences over them, by virtue of their peculiar quality
and affinity to thC?fe quadrants and parts of the terrefirial globe, as hath
been tefpeBively allotted them, . and which is fully explained in the in-
troduCtory'part of this work.

~~he fchetne being ereCted for the meridian of London, of courfc its
nppli<.:ation ::.pplies llloil: nearly to the aff3irs of this country; but in a
i<·condnry degree to our natural enemies and :1llies, and to the general
r,ffJirs of the northern hemifphcrc. For, if great exaanef.s be ~vHhed in
any p3rticnlar calculation, the fchcme mull: in all fuch cafes be ereclcd
for the precife latitude of the place or pro~incc to which the Cl)cu)ation
1norc immediately appertains; and, \vhere any firuggle exifis, or event
is foreboded, betwc~n any t\Vo particular fl:ates or empires, the fafefi
\Vay is to erect a fcheme for the o1eridian of each, and to exarnine l hcnl
by the fan1e rules as have been laid down for comparing a rcvolutional
figure \Vith the radix of a nativity.
In the figure before us, \Ve find twenty-feven degrees fifty-two tni-
nutes of Capricorn afcend the eaO:ern horizon; with thirty minutes of
S:lgittarius upon the cufp of the midheaven; which in1ports in a gent-ral
view peace and honour to the governrnent of Great Britain. Saturn "'c
find is lord of the afcendant, in conjunCtion \Vith lVlars, lord of the
ninth and fecond houfes ; and Venus, lady of the third and eighth, in
familiar congre(s with Mercury, lord of the fourth. fifth, and eighth,
houfes. 1'hefe are configurations particularly interefiing and impoctant;
and, being in the watery fign Pifces, they forepode amazing ftruggles and
contentions upon the continent; in which France, Germany, Rulfia, and
,.furkey, \\'ill be moll. c.Cfentially concerned.
No\.v, if we examine the introduBory part of this \Vork. plge Ioo, &c.
\ve Chall find Great Tartary, Sweden, Ruflia, &c. under the fign Aqua-
ries; and that Mufcovy, Saxony~ Turkey, &c. are under the fign Capri- -
corn; and are conftql;}ent1y reprefented by the afcendant of this figure,
and by the ponderous pJanet Saturn. The countries under the fign Scor-
pio and Aries, \vhich are the houfes of Mars, are EngJand, France, Ger-
many, Poland, Denmark, &c, and therefore Mars becomes lignificator
of then1, and, being in conjunCtion of Saturn, forelhews violent debate
and contention het\veen them. Thofe countries that are under 'fnurus
and Libra are Ireland, R uffia, Poland, South of France, Aull:ri3, &c. :1n·d
therefore under the pl~net Venus; and the places under Virgo and Ge-
1nini are Fl4nders, Amc::rica, &c. with the .cities of London, Paris, Ver-
failles, Lyons, &c. and Mercury, being lord of thefe figns, mull: of ne-
ccffity more or lefs unite thofe po"'ers in this counfel of fi.ate, held in
·the \vatery triplicity. And, as Jupiter di{pofes of all of them, nnd is in·
-his own ex~ltation in the figo Cancer, nod in tpe fixth hou{e, it repre-
{ents in a moft extraordinary and pleafing manner the peculiar fiate of Great
Britain, which he difpofes to peace· and acpity \Vith all the contcoding
ftates i particularly as Jupiter is in his eir~ntial dignities•

AN ILLUSTRATION
The fign Cancer, wherein Jupiter is pofited, is the fign under \vhich
the city .of Confiantinople is feated, and therefore reprtie~ns the Grand
Signior; and, as Jupiter is pofited therein, it declares h·e· wilJ not be
<iverthrown or. conquered, though a!failed on all ficies by powerfuI ene-
n1ies; hut, what is worfe, I find there will be occnfiona1 infurrections
amongll: themfelves, which is declared by the Moon's approach to the
oppofition of Jupiter; but, as the Moon is difpofcd of by Saturn, and
in fextile to her difpofitor, and her difpofitor beholding Jupiter with a
good trine afpect, it declares that the evil which J'l3th been tlirred up by
the enen1ies of the prefent Signior lhall be d~feated and eventua1Jv done
away by his fucceifor, \·Vho \Vill con1n1ence his reign in the tnidfi of thofe
troubles, \Vith the moft vigorous preparations for \Var, though his incli-
nation is for peace; which will be at length brought about by the aid
and interpofition of thofe powers pointed out by Mercury, Venus, Mars,
and Saturn, \Vho are all in conjunCtion in the afcendant, in the digoiries
of Jupiter, IV1ars, and Venus; ~nd thefe three planets declare that Great
Britain !hall be the principal aCtor in bringing all animofity to a conclu-
fion between Sw·eden, France, Ruffia, Denn1ark, and the Grand 1'urk.
.This appears to be the natural interpretation of the eftect of thefe four
planets in the afcendant, in the vernal equinox; but, to know when thefe
matters will come to pafs, we rnuft have recourfe to new figures for the
Sun's entrance into the next two tropical points, and the equinoB:ial
fign Libra, and lnuft likewife obferve th~ preceding full Moon, and the
new Moon fucceeding, according to the doElrine of the immortal
Ptolemy, heretofore laid do\vn ; as well as to obferve the dignities and
debilities of the planets, whence particular judgment will arife the (acne
as from the' dire8ions in a nativity, apd afford pleafure and fatisfaction
to the fpeculative mind.
The fignificators which reprefent the Court of France lhew a difpo-
fition to difiurb the; peace of Great Britain, through the infidious and
ambitious views of a female, who takes the lead in ftate..affairs. 1'he
aCtive pofition of Venus and ~ercury, conjoined in this fcheme~ denotes
inuch refileifnefs and infi:ability in the counfels of that country, \vhich
feen1s diftracled by the arbitrary will of the Gallic ~een, hert= reprefented
by Verius, upheld and afiified by.light, volatile) tiale-ferving, men, pre-
note~ by Mercury, the c~:eatures of the ~een, \vho, from motives of ava-
rice, and views of an1bition, will be forward to raife cabals; to oppofe
the cotntnon hopes and interefis of the people; to plunge the nation inlo
difcord and contef!tion, and eventually to bring about difput~s with their
neighbours, or wafteful war an1ong themfelves. Saturn, the fignificator
p.f the French J(ing, being_ united in a friendly conjunCtion with Mars,

that unhappy counby fectn inclined to fhnkc ofl', \rith the fhackJcs of
ilavery, 1nifery, and \\'nnt. In fine, here is every profpc&, front the

and illuHrious 1nen in church and Hate, preparatory to a re,·olution or
change in the affairs of that cn1pire, 'rhich 'rill at once aftoniflt aud
fGrprife the furrounding nations.
,
England, I am happy to fhy, has every profpcef of hannony and peace;
and, fron1 the fupcrior ftrength a1id clevntion of her fignificators, 'vi11 give
~a,vs to her enetnics, and peace and profi>crity to her allies. She \\·ill he

call in qqeftion the exprefs 'vol'ds of our Saviour hitn{elf, and give the
lie to authors and atteftators ofthe fi.rj-t-reputation and charaCter. Indeed,
the fo~rce of Revelation, and th~ doctrine of C hrifr, depend enti r~ly upon
·our opinion of the exifience. of fpirits ; for th~t, being confeifed·or doubt-

Thofe perfons, 'vho have tal~en pains to coi1te1nplate the nature and

A
sit is agreed by aU authars, ·and achnitted in the creed of. all fects
. and perfuafions of people, that, before tbe·fall, the feafons and elements
'vcre in-one unalterable ftate of perfection and hannony; fo the condi-.

In this action of the fiars upon _tnan, it leaves the 'vill and the foul
totally unconUrained; \\'hilft the body or corruptible part only is influ-

ofth(! fia1~~, or the po"rcr of the clen1ents, is found to produce in our na-

plain thern through all the tracks of occult fpccu1ation and fcience.

~~ro illufirate this ~xtraotdinary practice' of the ancients, I fl1~1l here
confider the nature .of the·'vorlcr of fpirits, their quality and office, and.
the afl1nity ~,vhich they hea-r to this 'vorl~, agreeable to the doCtrines·
laid dp\\'11 by tho1e ancient authors, \Vhofe "\V'Orks .are 110\V rarely to

· })laincd the nature and fituatipn of the dept_nted fpirits of n1cn, _after their
receis frotu this life. 'fhe 'vorld of_ 1{>irifs, iays this author, is neither·
]_leaven nor l1e1l, but a place or fiate bet,vixt both, into which 1nan i•n-
lpediately enters after death ; aud, after fiaying thc_:re a certain ti1ne,. longer
or fhoiter, according to '"hat his pail: lite had been in this \\"orll~, 1Je is
either receiyed ·up. into heaven, ·or caft dow·n into hell. It n1uft be
noted here, that tl.1is intern1ediatc fiate has nothing in it of the pro-
bationary kind; ~ fot· that is all over "rith the life of this "\\rorld ; but is a
i1ate of a feparation or reducing every one to his o\\·n proper prevaiJ-

There is a very near Colntnunication nncl co1Tcfpo1ldcncc bct,\·ixt the
fpirit nnd rcfpiratiou, and the 1notion of the heart ( /yflole), bct\\'ixt
thinking and rcfpiration, and betwixt the affeCtion of love and the heart;
fo that, 'vhcn thef~ t\~·o tnotions ceafc in the body, a fcparntion prcfcntJy
enfucs; for thefc t.wo 1notions, Yiz. that '\'hich is rcfpiratory in the
lungs, and that 'vhich is called the fyftolc or (:ontratlilc po\rcr of the
heart, are the l\\'0 . UOlldS of ~Inion, 'vhich ·whCll broken, the fpirit is
left to itfelf, and the body, being tleltitutc of life frorn the fpirit, be-
coincs cold and ·putrefies. That fo inti1nate a conununication iubfifis
betw·ccn the lnnnan fi)irit and rcfpiration, and the heart, is, becaufe all
the vital tnotions in this '\·orld depend thereon, not only in cotmnon,
but alto in every particular part of the body,
'fhe fpiri.t of a 1nan rctnains fame little time in the body after all figns
of li1e difctppear, but not longer than till a total ceflation of all po\\'er in
the heart enfucs, \vhich'varies according to the nature of the difcafc he
dies of, for the •notion of the heart continues long after in fon1c, but
not fo in others; but, as foon as the total ceffatiou of it happens, the rc-
fufcitation of tnan con1menccs,, and this by the fole po\rer of the Lord.
By refufcitation here is n1~ant the liberation of th~ fpirit of a n1an from
his body, and the introduCtion of it into the 'vorld of fpirit..;, and corn-
Jnonly called l{efurrec1ion. That the fpirit of a 1nan is not feparatcd
fr-on1 his body before all n1otion and po,ver in the heart entirely ccafcs,
is becaufe the heart correfponds ·to the affeCtion of love, ,,·hich is the
very life of Jnan, for it is fro1n love that every one derives his vital heat;
thcr~fore, fo l~ng as this conjunCtjon lafts, fo. Jong .the corrcfpondencc ·
continues, and Jt lS frotn correfpondcncy that the fpu·1t aCtuates and COin-
n1unicates life to the bodv.

that angels in heaven arc fron1 the lnunan race. 'fhis alfo tnore c\·ident-
ly appears frorn 1nan's being denotninated man froin his fpirit, an~l not
fro1n his body, and becaufc the eorporeal forn1 is an adjunct to the fpirit
after its fortn, and not contrarhvifc, the forn1cr being but the clothing of
the latter. 1\~foreovcr, the fpirit is the fole nloYing po"·cr in n1an, aCting

l·efpohding to the third heaven) fpiritualizes or fanetifies his virtues,

a.nd p_raetifed in accommodation to fociety and tranfitCtions in this 'vorld ;
and tl1erefore, though _it remains 'vith man for fome tirne after de~th, · yet
it is not long continued in, .as not being fuitable to the nature· of a fpirit,
for the follo\ving reafons: firfi, becaufe a; fpirit thinlts and fpeaks from:.

interior rec~if~s of his fpil·it, exercifes rule over his outward econon1y,
prefcribing la\vs thereto, ho'v to fpeak and act in order.to conciliate the-
good 'vill and favour of other~, and that by a coirftrained external beha-
viour. 'Thefe confiderations may ferve to fhow, that this interiqr ftate·
of liberty is not only -the proper ftate of the fpirit of a maiT after death,
but even in this life. 'Vhen a.(pirit has paffed into this fecond or interior
ftate, it tl1en appears outwardly what tnanner of 1nan, he had been in this
world, as he no\v acts from his proper felf; thus, if ~e had been a wife

and 'vifdom in his words and aCtions; as being freed frQm thofe corporeal
and eartl1ly e'mbarraflinents \V}J.ich nad fettered and obfcured.the in\vard
operations of his mind, whereas the bad man evidences greater folly than.·
before; for, 'vhilft in this \VOrld, he fa{hioned his external behaviour by

but th~ough the kno,vledge· of fpiritual good atid truth, and their oppo-'·
fites, evil and falfehood, whieh can only .cotne frotn previous inftruCtion..
As to good and truth in a civil and 1noral feufe, co1nmonly called
jnftice and fineerity, the(e may be ·}earned·from the la,vs of nations) and·
from converfation in vjrtuous co1npa.ny; but fpiritual good and truth, as
ingra.fted ·principles in the heart, are only received by the teachings of a·
divine light: for though they are literally fet forth~ iu th:e fcri.pture; and
the doCtrines .
of the Chriftian churches·· founded thereon, yet they only
gain:-the effi..cacy·of a vital principle. front a celeftial influence manifefting·
itfelf in a confcientious obedience to the divine laws, as pro1nulgated in
the written ·word, an.d that in refpect to the .divine authority of.thetn, and
not from felfifl1 and 'v'orldly motives; then a n1an is in the·heavenly life~
or in heaven, even 'vhilfi in this \Vorld.
The \vay of conveying inftructi~u in the other world differs-from· that
on earth, inafmuch as truths there are colnmitted not to the memory, bitt
to the life; for the me1nory of fpirits is in their life's principle,·and they
receive and imbibe only what is conformable·ther~to ; for fpirits are fo
many 'hu1nan fotms of thei1~ ow~ affe&ions.. As the- nature of fpirits is·
fuch; therefore ·they are continually· infpired with an affection for truth
for ·the uies· of life ; for the Lord has fo ordered. it, that.every one fi1ould
·· love the ufes tbat accord 'vith their particular gifts and qualities: which-
love is likewife heightened by the hope .of their becotning angels ; for in
heaven all1
particular and fingular ufes have relation to the general ufe·or .
good of the Lord's kingdom, and may be confidered as fo many parts of -
one whole, fo that the truths 'vhich they learn· are both .truths and the
ufes of truths conjunCtly: thus the angelical fpirits are prepared for hea-
ven. The affeCtion or love of truth for the purpofes of ufe is infinuated
into them many 'vays not known in this 'vorld, n1ore particularly by
various· reprefentations of ufe.:under fuch delightful forms as affeCt both
their minds ·and fenfes 'vith unfpeakable pleafure; fo that, when any fpirit
js joined to the. fociety for 'vhich. he 'vas prepared, he then enjoys life
moft when heis in ·the exercife ofits proper ufes. Hence it n1ay app~r, ,

for exa1nplc, in good n1en this equilibriun1 is afl'ecretl by the aCtion· of the ·
good principle,·and tlrc re-aCtion of• the evil principle ; but in bad nten,
evil is the agent, and good ·is but the~ re-agent:' That there is· a fpiritual

'fhe heaven~, in lhc general, arc difi.ingui1l1cd into t'YO kitlgdom,; the
one of ,,,.hic:h i.i called the ccJcHial, the oth<!t· the fpiriLual, kingdo1n. 'fhc
hells likewite arc clifiiuguilhed into two kingdon1"; the one of \\'hich is
oppofitc to the celcfiial, the other to the fpiritual. 'rhat which is op-
pofite to the celcH iu1 is in the 'rcH, and they \\'ho belong to it arc called
genii; and that 'rhich is oppofitc to the ir)iritual Jtingdonl i:; in the
north and fouth, aucl they \rho belong to it arc called evil fpit·its. AU
in the celeftial kingdon1 excel in love to the Lord, and all that are in the
hells oppolite to that kiugdotn are under the prevailing pow·cr of fclf-
]oy·e; all that helon~ to the fiJiritual kingdotn arc diHinguit11cd in cx(·el-
lc·nce by love to their neighbour, and all that arc in the hells oppo{itc to
this kingdotn arc 1lavcs to the love of the 'vorld; fo that love to the
Lord and the lo,.,e of felf are in the fiunc diatnctrical oppofition to each
other as the loYe of our neighbour and the love of the 'vorlcl. Effctlual
provifion is n1a.de by the Lord, that no po,vcr of evil, fron1 the hells that
arc in oppofition to the cclcfiial kingdont, may reach the fubjctls of the
~ fpiritual kingdotn, as the confequence in that cafe 'vould be the fubv·cr-
fion of th_e !attcr.' 'I'hus ~oes the Lord keep the balance bet\\·i•t good
and e,·il in his O\Vn hand for the prefervation of his kingdoms.
:As good and evil, truth nnu falfehood, are ofa fpiritual nature, fo alfo is
that equiliuritun in 'rhich confifis the po\ver of thinking and '\Tilling the
one or the other, and the liberty of choofing or rcfufing accordin~1y.
'l'his liberty, or freedo1n of the 'rill, originates in the divine nature, but
is given to every n1an by the Lord for a property o.f his life, nor does he
eyer take it back again. This good gift to man is to the end that. he 1nay
he regenerated n.nd faved, for '~"ithout free 'rill there is no falvation for
hitn; but that he aCtually poffefics it, he 1nay knO\V front the operations
of his 0\Vll Jnind, and Vwhat pafles ill\\rardly in his fpirit, he being alJ)e to
think and choofe either good or evil, 'vhatever reftraints he 1nay be under
fron1 uttering or aCting the latter part in refpeet to law·s divine or hutnan.
N O\V this in\vard experience evinces, beyond a thoufand arguu1ents, that
liberty belongs to n1an, as his fpirit ·is his proper fclf, and it is that
'vhich freely thinks, ":ills, and choofcs; confequcntly, liberty i·.; to be
citin1ated according to the inner man, and not from 'rhat he 1nay be out-
\rardly through fe<ir, htunan rcfpeets, or other external rcfiraints.
'fhat n1an 'rould not be capable of being reforn1cd or regenerated 'ritlt-
out free ""ill, is becaufe he is .by the original confiitution of his nature
boril to evils of every l<ind, 'vhich 1nuft be reanoved in order to his 1~11-
,:ation; and that can only be by his kno\\·ing, O\rning, renouncing, and
abhorring, them. 1
fo this end} he 1nuH be inftruCled in the nature of

munication, or by the power of 1uagical rites and ceren1onies of any claf.c.;

authors admitted, that infinite numbers of the angelic hofl: are e1nployed
for the glory of God, in 'v-atching gver and l)roteeting the pur£uits of

the vulgar arc naturally addiCted and prone to bclit•\·c. l~ut, if we ri;;htl~,

n1uft look upon the fitnilitude of light and darkncfs, in this outward \\·orld,

that it rctnoves itfclf to fon1c other place or country, hut the hrighlncf.1
of the. light oYcrpo\vcrs and 1\\·allo,rs it up, Cc; that. though it difappear.)
yet it is as abfolutely there as the light ilfclf. 'fhc f:1.n1c fitnilitude is
alfo · to be confiucrcd in the dcfeription of the habitation~ of good evil
·beings, that arc rea11y in one another, yet not <:ontprc.hended of one

gers to each other. A fitnilitudc hereof "·c have in the faculties of hu-
Jnan life, confidered 'vith refpeet to the cndo,,·Inents of the foul in the
jufi., ·and in the 'ricked; for to be good, pure, and holy, is rca:IJy Iirc-
fent as a quality-in potentia 'rith the depraved foul, although at that in-
Hant ··the Joul be clothed 'rith abp1nination, fo that the eye \Vhich
fl1ould behold God, or goodnef~, is put out. Yet, if the foul 'rould but
cotne out of itfelf, and C!~ter into another fource, or principle, it n1ight
conte to fee the kingdonr of heayen 'vithin itfelf, arcon.ling to the Scrip-
ture and .1\{ofcs, "the word is nigh thee, in thy heart, and irl tlig nzoutll."
.
True it js, that the devils, or fallen angels, cannot all alike 1nanifeft
thcntfelvcs in this aftral "·orld; becauic the nature of fotnc of thc1n ap-
proaches ucarer to the external quality than others; fo that, althoughpro-

whereas no.'v ~ll tllefe 'enjoyments are free ·atnongft 'mankind; which
~royes, that it is extremely hard ~ for infernal fpirit_
s to ·appear jn the
third principle of this world; ri:!ld as difficult a.~ for a man to 1ive under
)Vater1 ·or fifhes on the fhore.. Yet \Ve ·1nuft grant, that, 'vhen t1'le ilnagi•
nations and·eatneft defires ofthe ·,vicked have ilirr.~d :up the centre of hell
. wjthin thetnfelves, lhen the devil hath accefs to this world in their
defires·,,. and continues_here to vex and totment them, fo long as the
~\'engtl1 of thofe defires 1·emain, 'rhich \Vas the1irft: attt-ac1ive caufe.
Th~ . caufe_ofthe pau~ity of app~a~·anoes·of evil fpirits in thefe_days,
is the -fulnefs ·of time, and the brightnefs of Chriftianity, difpelling the
~ifts: .of herefy and idolatry, as the Sun doth the fogs, 'vhicl1 vanifh on
its appearance; not by any violence or cotnpulfion, but from a ~aufe hn-
pl'anted in the natutc of things and their oppofites. Even fo the king-
do(n ,of light, ,as it overfpreads the foul in · po,ver and doniinion, clofes
up the centre of darknefs, and fcatters the influences of the devil befol~e it,
\Vhb becomes as -it 1vere enti~·ely pqflive as to the 'vorks and ''ill of man.
In the"time of' 'the law·, 'v·hen the wrath and jcaloufy ofthe Father 'had
the.'do1i1itiion in the·kingdom of nature, infernal fpirits had •nore ca(y ac-
cefs to .mankind than they no'v pave;'for, before the incarnation of Chdft~
the~anger of God '.Vas unappeafed, and had more do1ninion over fhe foul
of.rtlah, which 'vas lhen ·at greater diftance fron1 the divine goodnef.s;
confequently the devils could 'vith more .facility·fpring ~1p in the element
of \vrath, an~ manifeft themfelves in this outfvarcl principle ; beeanfe
the v~ry idea and bafis ofhell is founded on the 'vrath of God, which is
the only channel by 'vhich the devil is conveyed into this '\\'·orld.. So~
whe·n the miracles of Chrift began to manifeft the1nfelves in the 'vorld,
t4e multiplicity of diabolical appearances, and poffe!fed \Vith the devil~'
began infenfibly to decay and vanifh. It is true, that the greateft inftances
kno\vh ofthe temptations and po,verof Satan~ 'vere exercifed in that fpace
of tin1e bct\vixt the incarnation and c111Cifixion of our Saviour; yet it is as
certain~ that the~ devil knew he had but a iliort time longer to uphold l1is
li.ingdom here, and therefore he etnployed all his flrength and forces to
to1~ment thofecaptive and n1iferable fouls to \vhonl Chriit can1e to ~preach
deliverance. But, after the partition-\vall \Vas broken down, and the vail
of 1\tiofes, and the \vrath of God, ·were removed, there 'vas a fenfible .and·
vifible decay of Satan's po,ver in the-lforld ; 1o that, though it be pof-
fible, even in thefe days, by a r~nunciation of the falvation of Chrift, -
and by becoming a difciple of the devil, to hold correfpondence. ·with~
9r :to be wholly poffeifeil by, him; yet thefe things happen fo rarely, a!1d ·.

pretended fo to be, there ts great roorn to doubt the truth of fuch aficr·
tions, though apparently 'vcll authenticated.
But, not\vithfiancling that the coming of Chrift has thus c:urtailcd ·
\he po"·ct· of the devil over nll Chriftian countries, yet fuch nations ns
have nevc1· embraced the Chrifiian faith, but purfuc the ancicntfupcrtiition
and idolatry, arc ftitl deluded and bewitched by hint, bccaufc, the centre
of truth and light never having been a\vakcncd in thcrn, the po\vcr of
Satan eafily prevails to fcduc:c thctn to wortl1ip things vifiblc, inftcad of
tl1c true God: for, 'vhcrc moil: darkncfs and fupc.rftition is found, 'vhe-
ther in religion or pcrfonal underHanding, there his po,vcr is a.h,·ays tnott
})redon1inant. 'fhus it is no\v 'vith the mifc,·ablc inhabitants of the
grcatcft part of Afia, and the uncultivated and ferocious parts of Africa
and Arnerica; yet \VC have hopes that the goodnefs of Providence, in l1hs
O\Vn flt and appointed fcafon, \viii, through fome favourable channel,
comn1unicatc the light of the Gofpcl to thofe mi[et·ablc beings, \vhcrcby
the f11ocking iden of feeding on human flefh, of devoting one another
to defirutlion and flaverv, and of purfuing the infinuations and 'vorks
of the devil, ntay he totally abolilhed, and every part of the habitable
globe be united in the ackn(nvledgtnent of one God, of one Saviour, and
of one liberal, candid, and impartial, Chrjftian perfuafion.
.As to the different fl1apes a'nd forms of the dcviIs, it is fuggcftcd by
Scripture, and adJnitted by all 'vritcrs upon the fubjeet, that they ,~·ere
an{\yerab1c in 1nonftrofity and hideoufncfs to the fuperior rank they held
in heaven, and to the enormity ofthe offence ~rhich ,\·ns the caufe of their
fall. Thus, in l~evelation, Lt1cifer, as the leader and prilne apofiatc, is
tetmcd the g-reat dra.tton, and Icing of the devils. And hence it il) con-
ceived, that thofe ,~,ho belonged to the fuprcrne hierarchies in heaven,
and \\'"ere the fnretnoft to rebel, 'vere, i1nmediately on their expulfion
frorn the renhns of blifs, transfor1ned fro1n angels of fplendour anti glorr,
to devils in the fl1apc of dragons, crocodiles, ferpents, tigers, aud the
Iike; fo that the moft pervcrfc and potent among the de\~ils pofiefs the
mofl ugly UJld fri~htful of the befiial ihapcs, but a thoufand tirnes n1ore
terrific and frightful than can poffibly be conceived fron1 the n1ofi fero-

rial diftinClion to be 1nadc bet,vecn the -apofiate angels nnd the datu.ned
fouls, wh1ch have dcfcrtcd God in this world, and become inhabitants of

AN ILLUSTRATION
The manner and feafons 'vherein apparitions and ghofts appear are as
v~rious as they are uncertain. So1netimes, before the perfon to 'vhvtn
they properly belong departs this life,. they 'rill, by external vifible prefen-
tation of then1felves, forc\varn him of the time or day ·whe~ein death f11all
approach him. Sometimes the apparition of a perfon 'vill appear to its
beloved friend; hu{band,.·,vife, or relation, at 1nauy tho~fand miles dif:_
tance, .to acquaint thern of its departure fron1 this life; -\vhilft other,vife
t.he party 'vould be totally ignorant of this event. And it has often been
}(no'\vn, that 'vhen' rio one individual of the k.indrcd or fatnily of the
de~eafed J)Ct:fon has been vifite~ or dift~rb~d by it, or even Jnade ~enfible
ofIts appeartng, yet'to fon1e of 1ts moft 1ntnuate or beloved acquaintance
it difcovcrs it{elf, and importunes ~hen1 to perforn1 fome ceremony or
pro1nife, that it 1nay be ad1nitted into reft. At other times it ditcovers
lome treafure ,vhich 'vas hidden by the deceafed party ; or elfe fon1e
murder \vhich it.had con1mittecl. But the tnoft frequent catife of their
returning, is \vhen the party himfelf hath been privately murdered; for -
fuch is the poifonous malice and rancourous fpirjt of n1urderers, that in-
nocent blood, thus inhtunanly fpilt,. crieth up to heaven, and the departecl
fpirit cannot rcfi till the 1nurder be made 1nanifeft to the \vorld, after
,vhich difcovery it is received into reft. This is the rca.fon ,vhy, for
tnany years together, ghofts co'ntinue, to be feen' in one particular place,
ever 'vatching for fit opportunity to difcover or n1ake kno\vn the caufe
of their appearing; but 'vhich is often attended 'vith great difficulty and
delay, as \vell on account of the natural timidity of htUn3:n beings, as for
'vant of the prcper organs of corporeal voice and touch in the fpirit,
\vhich, being no part·of their quality or effence, is procured \vith great
difficulty, a·nd at heft but inarticulate, doleful, and in broken ar.'cents.
rrhat this·· is true, the ufual manner of their appearance in·a great mea-
fure proves; fQr all that they are able to effetl, if they have been Inur-
dered, is to appear near the place \vhere the body li,e·s, and to tee1n a~
1
if
they funk~ .do·wn or van~fhed in the fame; or el~e to appear in the form
of a1nurdered corpfe, 'vith mangled body, and bleeding 'vounds, difhc-
velled. hair, and convulfive countenance; .but it is rarely J{no\v~ that
fuch apparitions have plainly fpoken, or uttered, by 'vords, either the
ti1ne and place of their murder, or the caufe, manner, or perfon's name;
unlefs the perpetration of.t~e de~d be mark.ed with circutnftanees uncom-
monly horrid ancl execrable, in \vhich cafes~ I .an1 ~old, the remetnbrance··
of the fan1e doth fo much more po,verfully operate upon the faculties of
the apparition, as to enable it to fran1c the funilitude of a voice, fo as to
clifcover the fatt, and give fome leading-clue to dete& aud"punith the .
'vicked perpetrator.

a 1nan to continue "rith his head under \Vater, or for the inhabitants of
the \\1atery cletncnt to be ptaeed upon dry lantl. But it is only the appa-

their defired reH:, 'rithout the poffibility of returning to this fnblunary
'rorld .again, but in the capacity of angels of Jight, to execute t~~e divine
miHions of the Deity. .
In the ,vritings of Plato, there are 1nany ftrange and 1ingular rcprefcu-
tations of the apparitions. or departed fouls of men, \rith accounts of their
torments and purgations, the· caufe of their returning, 'rhat their na-
ture and C1nployn1ent arc, their fubftancc and property, food and nourif11-
n1ent; from all 'vhich that great philofopher and hiitorian \ras induced
to believe, that, 'vhen the fpirits of good and exemplaty 1nen returned, it
'vas to perfons of a like habit and difpofition 'vith then1felves, \raming
then1 in their flcep of certain dangers or mal_evolent defigns forn1ing
agaii1ft. then1; or clfe conveying heavenly doctrines or ingenious inven':
tions to their n1ind, for the honour of religion or the good of fociety.
And in like n1anncr, if the ghoft of a \vieked and execrable character re-
turned, it 'vas to thofe of a profligate and abandone"'d courfc oflife, "..hon1
it inftigates, aileep or a\vakc, to· the in~·cntion and exercife of notorious
villnnies_, to blafphetnies a~ainft G·od, ·and to fedition, rapine, and Jnur-
der, atnongft n1en. The difciplcs of Pythagoras eftablithed an opinion
uot very diftercnt fro111 this. They held that there "·as a continual
tradutlion and trantn1igration of fouls frotn one fiate to another, t iH
they becan1e deified at lafi; .and that they frequently appeared to per-
fons of the H1n1c bent of ntind and inclination, .to inilrucl and forC\\·arn

the Oracles of old proceeded fron1 fuch·fpirits ·as had been the ghoft~ or

To make a vegetable more quickly yield its _fpirit, take of \vhat vegc- ·
table you pleafe, \Vhether it be the feed, flo\VCrs, roots, fruit, or leaves;
cut or bruife them (mall, put. them into wann \Vater, put upon them

jn the fame manner·as beer ; then difiil th'cm, and they \vill yield their
fpirit very eafily. Or clfe take of \vhat herbs, flo\vcrs, feeds, &c. you
pleafe, fill the head of a frill there\vitb, then cover the Jnouth \Vith
coat:fe canvas, and fet on the fl:ill, having firfi: put into it a proportionable
quantity of .fack or lo\v \Vine; then. give it fire, and it \vill quickly yield
its fpirit ; but obierve, that, if the colour of the vegetables' is '''anted, you
1nuft take fotne of its dried flo\vers, and fill the note of the frill there\vith,
anti you \Vill have the exact colour of the herb. •
To elucidate this procefs \vith better effect, I have fubjoiued a plate

N o\v this effeCt, though very furprifing, will not appear- fa" much a·
, ·fubject of our afronilhment, if we do but confider the wonderful po,ven
o'f fympatby, \vhich exiil:s throughout the whole fyfiem·of nature~ where
every thing is excited to beget or love its like, and is dra.
wn after it, as..
fhe loadftone dra\VS iron ; the male after the female.; the- evil after the
evil; th~ ·good after the good; which is alfo feen in \vicked~ men and"
their purfuits, and in birds and beafrs of prey; where the latnb delights~
not with the lion~ nor the iheep in the fociety of the. wolf; neither do .
men whofe minds are totally depnived and efrranged from God, care to
adopt the oppofite qualities, which are virtuous, innocent, and juft•.
Without contemplating thefe pri11ciples, we ihould think. it incredible
that the .grunting or iqueaking of a little pig, or the fight of a fimple
:fheep, 1hou1d t~rrify a mighty elephant!· and yet by that means the Ro-
mans put to flight Pyrrhus and all his ho{l. One would hardly·fuppofe~.
that. the ·crowing of a cock or the fight of his comb, ihould aba!h a
puiifant lion;. but experience has proved the truth of it to all the \vorld..
vVho ,vould imagine that a poifonous Jfer-pent could not Jive under the
fhade of an afh..tre'e ;. or that fome men, deficient neither in·· couraO'e,,.
ftrength,. or c9nfritutio~1, fhould not be able to endure the )fight of a
cat ? and yet thefe things are feen and .kno\Vll to be fo~ by frequent obfer-
vation and e'xperience. The friendly intercourfe ~etv1ixt a fox and a fer-
pent is. almpft incredible ; ana how .fond· and loving the lizatd is to .
tnan \Ve read in ,every treatife on natu.ral hiftory,.;. \vhich is not far, if
nny thing, behind the fidelity of a fpaniel,.and !Dany·other fpecies of dogs,.
whofe fagacity and attention to their mafter is celebr~ated in an infinite
variety of wcll-fourided though ahnoft incredible ftories.~ The amity be-.
twixt a caftrel and a pigeon is remarked by tnany anthoFs ; particularly
how furioufl.y the ~ftrel will defend a pigeon fron1the fpa'rto\v-havvk, andf
other inimical birds. · In the vegetable fyfiem, the operation and'virtue of

'The lily and the rofe rejoice by each other's ftrlc; \YhiU1 the fla" aud the

earth or 1nould, the fame fyn1pathics and antipatlues are prcfervcd. Ani-
mated nature, in every clime, in every corner of the globe, is nlfi> preg-
nant \vith fin1ilar qualitiec ; and that in a tnofi \Voudc:rful and admirable
degree. Thus \Ve find that one particular bone taken out of a carp·s
head \vill fiop an hemorrhage of blood, \\'hen no other part or thiug in
the tame creature hath any fimilar effect. The bone alfo in a hare's foot
infiantly mitigates the molt excruciating tortures of the cratnp ; yet no
other bone nor part of that animal can do the like. I tnight alfo recite
infinite properties \Vith \Vhich it has pleated God to en,!uc the fonn and
body of man, '''hich are no lefs worthy of adtniration, and fit for this
place, had \Ve but limits to recount them. Indeed I do not ktlO\V a much
znore remarkable thing,_(\vere it as rare as it is uow .illatneful1y prevalent,)

by which \Ve fee a matt fo totally overthrown, that not a fingle part or
. member of his body can .perform its funtl:ion or office, and his under-
finnding, me1nory, and judgtnent, fo arrcfte.d or depraved, that in every
thing exc-ept the thapc, he becomes a very beafi! But \Ve find, from
obfervations ho\vevcr important, ho\vcver 'vondcrful, ho\v inexpli-
cable or mirac11lous, foever any thing 1nay be, yet if it is common, or L1-
m1liar t~ our fcnfcs, the \Yonder ceafes, and our enquiries end. And
hence it is, that \Ve look not \vith half the adtniratiou upon the fun,
moon, and frars, that \\'e do upon the mechauifm of a globe, ~.vhich
does but counterfeit their order, nnd i5 a mete bauble, the \Vork of 1nen·s ·

Und~r the veil of natural tnagic, it, hath pleafed the A)mighty to con..
.ceal many valuable ~nd excellent gifts, · wh!ch .common people either·
.think miraculous or next- to itnpoifible: And yet in truth, natural ma-
gic is nothing tnore than the workmanihip of nature, made tnanifefi by
art ; for in tillage, a~ nature p1~oduceth corn and herbs, fo art, being
nature's handmaid, prepareth and helpeth it forward .; in 'Vhich times
and feafons are materially to be 'confidered; for annus, non arv.us, producit
arijlas. Aad,,though thefe things, \vhile they lie hid in nature, do rpany _
of the!n feem impoflible. and miraculous, yet, \vhen they are kno~'ll
and their fimplicity revealed, our difficulty of apprehenfion ceafes, and the
'"onder is at au end; for that o!11y is \Votiderful. to the beholder \vhereof
. he can conceive no caufe nor reafon, according to the faying of Ephefius,
lvfiraculum folvitur tt11rle videtur eJ!e tniracu!ttm; yet vve·often tee perfons
take great pains, and put themfelves to vaft expence, to d!tcover thefe
-jmpalpable tracks of nature, from 'vhence pecuniary atlvantages feldom
refult; '(o that a man mull: not learn philofophy to grow rich; but 1nufl:
get riches to learn philofophy. There is unq-qefti~nably much praife
due, and great.indull:ry required, for obtaining a competent kno\vledge of
natural magic ; (or to fiugg~rds, niggards, ·and nar.row-rni.nded men, the,
fecrets of nature an~ never opened, though the ftudy of thetn is c.ertainly·
conducive to the glory of God, and to the good of fociety, by more vifi- '
bly manifefiing the omnipotency of his works, and by fkilfully applying
them to man~s ufe and benefit. Many philofophers of the firfr eminence,
as Plato, Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, &c. tra~·elled through
e~er;y region of the known \Vo~ld for the accomplifhment of this kind of
kno\vledge; a.nd at their return, th~y publicly preache~ and taught it.
But above all, ~~e learn fl·om facred and profaue hifiory, that Solomon '~'as
the greatefr proficient in this art of any either before or fince his time ;
as he himfelf4ath dec]ared in Ecclefiafres and the book of vVifddm, where
he fait?, " God hath given me the true fcience of things, fo as to kno\V
~' hovv the \vorld .~as made, ·and the power of the elen1en ts, the begin-
" ning, and the .end, and the mid{[ of times, the change of-.ieafons, the
"courfes of the year, and the fituation of the frars, the nature of human
" beings, and the quality of beafis, the power of winds, and the ima-
" ginations of the mind ; the diver6ties of plants, the virtues of roots~
'' and all things whatfoever, whether fecret · or kho,vn, manifefi: or in-
" vifible." And hence it was that the magi, or followers of natural
1nagic, were accounted wife, and the fiudy honourable; becAufe it con-
fifis in n~thing more than the moil: p'rofound and perfeCl: part of natural
philofophy, which defines the nature, caufes, and effeCl:s; of things.

Ho\V f:1r fuch inventions as arc called charms, amulets, periapts,
and the like, have any foundation in natural mugic~ may be '''orth our
enquiry ; bccaufe if cures arc to be effeClcd through their medium, nnd
that \Vithout any thing derogatory to the attributes of tha Deity, or the
principles of religion, I ice no reafou \vhy they fhouJd be rcjefted \vith
that inexorable conte1npt, \vhich levels the \vorks of God \\'ith the
folly and wcaknefs of men. Not that I \vould encourage fuperfiition,
or become an advocate for a farrago of abfurdities; but \vheu the fimpli-
city of natural things, and their· cffctls, arc rcjeClcd merely to encourage
profeffional artifice and cJnolument, it is prudent for us to difiinguifh
bet\veen the extremes of bigottcd fupcrfl:ition aud total unbelief.
It \Vas the opinion of, many eminent phyfician~, of the lid} ability and
learuing, that fitch kind of charms or periapts as confified of certain odo-
riferous herbs, balfamic roots, 1nineral concretions, and metallic Cub-
fiances, might have, and mo{l probably poifcffed, by means of their
ftrong tnedicinal properties, the virtue of curing or removing fuch.")coln-
plaints as external applications might efFeCl, and \Vhich are often ufed
with fuccefs, though without tl?e leafr furprife or admiration ; becaufc
the one appears in a great tneafure to be the confequence of manual ope-
ration, \Vhich is percept,:blc and v!Jible to the fenfcs, 'vhiHl the other
acts by. an innate or occult po'\ver, \vhich the eye cannot fee, nor the
mind fo readily comprehend ; yet, in both cafes, perhaps., the_effeCl: is
produced by a fimilar caufe; and confequently all fuch remedies, let them
be applied under '\vhat form or fiyle they may, are \vorthy of our regard;
and ought to excite in us not only a veneration for the fimple praClice of
the ancients in their medical experiments, but a due fenfe of gratitude
to the vvife Author of our being, \Vho enables us, by fuch eafy. means, to
retnove the infirn1ities incident to mankind. 1\'lany reputable authors,
particular1y A. Ferrarius; Alexander Trallianus, Aetius, Otlavianus, i\Iar- ..
cellus, Philodotus,Archigines, Philofiratus, Pliny,and Diofcorides, contend
that not only fuch phyfical alligations, appenfions, periapts, atnul.ets,
charn1s, &c. vvhich from their materials nppear to imbibe and to diftufc
the medical properties ,above defcribed, ought in cert~in obfiinate and
equivocal diforders to be applied·; but thofe like,vife, " ·hich from their

jnfallible evidence. in -the hiccough, which is·· infrantaneouOy ·cured by
any fudden effeCt of fear or furprife ; fo like'Arife algues and many other tna-

ftagnation wrought upon the rnafs of blood Dy imtnerging the body in the

unable to mov~ eitber hand or foot, have through the fudden fright of
fire, or the houfe falling in upon tben1, forgot their infirmity, and run
away \Vith as much activity as though no fuch 1nalady had exified. See-

c·onfederacy, and aCl: by the medium of aerial or infernal fpirits.. To that ·
mind, \vhich has but flightly contetnplated the works of nature, . it mu:fl:
be abundantly evident, that the great and good God. which fufrains and
governs the univerfc, hath in the \Vorks of creation mercifully afforded
us a nattiral retnedy for all our infirmities; and it is repugnant .to common
:fenfe, and incompatible \Vith religion and morality ; nay, it would· itn-
ply a deficiency either in the goodnefs or po\ver of the Deity, were· we
for a mpment to adtnit the neceffity of charms,. amulets, or any other
inventive cures or benefits to men, refu!ting from a compaCt with fpi!"-

the ·external objeCt or pretence be what it may, it is not only con,.
trary to nature, but highly offenfive to the Deity, and nearly. allied
to the :Chocking fin of idolatry, by applying the works of God ·to
the power of the devil. For this reafon, it is impoffible to he too cau-

'veil-authenticated letter to that prelate.
A UTJIENTIC CoPY of a LETTER ftnt to the Blfoop of Gloucefl~r, by the
Revere11d "A1r. Arthur Bedford, Mi11ijler of Ternple Church, i1J Brijlol.
My LoRD,. Brijlol, Augujl 2, 1703·
Reing informed by Mr. Shute·of. your lord!hip's defire that I ihould
comn1unicate to you what I had kno\vn concerning a certain perfo1?, \Vho
1vas acquainted \Vith fpirits to his O\Vll dcfiruB:ion, I have made bold to
give you the trouble. of this letter, hoping tny defire to_grati(v your
lordfhip in every particular n1ay be an apology for the length thereof. I.
had fonnerlv CYiven an account to the.late Bifhop of Hereford, in \\'hich
.I ,:)
there are probably f(nne things contained, \vbich I do not no\V remen1ber,.
'vhich, if you1: lordlhip could procure from his lady, (\vho no\V lives near
Glouccfter,J ,v.ould be more.authentic.
About thirteen years ago, 'vhilfi I \Vas curate to Dr. Read, reCtor of
St. Nicholas in this city, I began to be acquainted \Vith one 'I'homas
Perks, n tnan about t\venty years of age, \Vho lived \Vith his father at
MonO'atsfield, a aunfinith ; and contracted an intimacy \\'ith him, he
being not only·a ~ery good-nat~1red mati, but.extrcm_cly fk~lled in_nlathc:-

.' metry, gauging,. furveying, a·fironomy, and algebra ; he had a notion
of the' perpetual tnotion, much like that wheel in Archi1nedes's' Mathe-
tnatical Magic, in \Vhich he had made fome improvements, and which
he has held \Vas dernonftrable from mathematical principles, ·though I
could never believe it. I have feen an iron wheel, to which he intended
to add .feveral things of his own invention, in order to fini!h the fame;
but, thinking it of no llfe,. and being other\yife unfortunately engaged,
it \vas never perfeCted. lie gave himfelf io much to aftronomy, that he
could not only calculate the motions of the planets, hut an eclipfe alfo;
and demonftrate any probletn in fpherical trigonometry from n1athema-
.tical principles, in \Vhich he difcovered a clear force of reafon. vVb'en
one Mr. Bayley, minifrer of St. James's in this city, endeavQured to fet
-11p a mathematical fchool, I advifed him·to this ~ho1nas Perks, for an
acquaintance, in \V hom, as he told me, he found a greater proficiency
in thofe .ftudies than he expeCted or could have imagined. After this he
applied himfelfto afl:rology, and \vould fometimes calculate nativities and
refolve horary quefiions. When by the providence of God I \Vas fettled
in~ Temple p~riih~ and not having feen him for fon1e time, he came to
.J.ne, and, \ve being in private, he afked my opinion very ferioufly con-
cerning the la\vfulne!s of converfing with fpirits; and after I had given
my thoughts in the negative, and confirmed. them "~ith the belt reafons
I could, he told me he had confidered all thefe argutnents, and believed
they only related·to conjurations,· but there was an innocent f~ciety with
thetn \vhich a man might ufe, if he 1nade no compaCts \vith them, did
no .harm by thei1· 1neans~ and \Vere not ct1rious in• prying into hidden
.things; and that he hitnfelf had difcourfed with them, and heard them
fing to his great :!atisfaCl:ion; and gave an offer to me a,nd Mr; Ba.yley at
another ~ime, that, if we vvould go with him one _I1ight to l(ingf,vood,
\Ve fhould fee them, and hear them both talk and fing, and talk with them
\vhenever vve had a mind, and \Ve ihould return very fafe ; but ·neither
of tlS 'had the courage to venture. I told hin1 the iubtilty of the devil
to delude 1nankind, and to t,ran~forn1 himfelf into an angel of light; but
he \\7
ould .not believe it \vas the devil. I had feveral conferences vvith
nirn upo1J this fubjeCt, but could neyer convince him, in all which I '
could never obferve. the leafl: diforder of .tninc;l, his difcot1rfe b~ing very

ationa1, and I .propofed (to try ~itn) a quefiion in aftronotny relating
to the :projeClion of the fj)here, which he projeCted aqd refolved, and
did after\vards demonfrrate from the mathetnatics, fo as to demonfirate at
~the fame time that his brain \vas free from the leafi tinCture of madnefs
and diftraetion.-Having this opportunity of a1king him feveral partici.l-
lars, concerning the n1ethods he ufed, at,d the difcourfes he had vvith
them, he told me he had a book whofe direCtions he followed, and ac-

cordingly, in the dead time of the night, he \\'Cilt out to a crofs \\'ay, \\'il'h
a Janthorn and cnndlc coufecratcd for this purpofc \Vith fevcral incanta-
tions. I..Jc had alto con1ccrated chalk, confiHing of fevcral mixtures, \vith
\vhich he made a circle at_\V hat ddlaucc he thought fit, \Vithin \vhich no
fj)irit had po\vcr to enter. After this· he invoked the fpirit by feveral
forms of \Vords, (iornc of \vhich he told n1c \vere taken out of the holy
Scriptures:t and thcrcf()re he thought them }a,vfu), \vithout confidcring
ho\v they tnight be wrcfictl to his defiru~ion ;) accordingly the fpirits ap-
peared to hin1 \Vhich he called for,- in the thape of little maidens, about
a foot and half high, and played about a circle. At firfi he \\'a5 fomc-
\Vhat affi·ighted, but, after fame finall acquaintance, this antipathy in
nature \Vore oft~ at,d be becarnc pleafed \V ith their cornpauy. He told
tne they ~,okc \Vith a very lhrill voice, like an ancient \voman. I Ie a!ked
thcn1 if there \vas a heaven or hell? they faid there \vas. He a!ked them
\Vhat place heaven \Vas? 'vhich they defcribcd as a place of great glory
and happine!s; and he aiked them \Vhat he11 'vas! and they bade hin'l afk
no queftions of that. nature, for it \vas a dreadful thing to relate, and the
d~vils believe and tremble. He further aikcrl then1 \Vhat method or·order...
they had arnong themfelvcs? they told hitn they \Vere divided into three
orders ; that they had a chief \Vhofe refidence \vas in ·rhe air ;· that he had
feveral counfellors 'vhich vvere placed by him in forn1 of a globe,. and he
in the centre, \Vhich \Vas the chicfeft order; another order \vas etnp.Joycd
in going to and from thence to the earth, to carry intelligence from thofe ·
lovvea: i}Jirits; and their O\VIl order was on the earth; according to the·
dir~C1~ons they fhould· receive fro1n tho"fe in theair..
This defcription \Vas very furprifing, but, being contrary to tlie account
\Ve have in fcripture of the hierarchy of the bleffed .angels, made me con-
clude they \Vere devils, but I could uot-convince hin1 of it. He told me
he had bade t~etn .ling, and they \vent to fo1ne difiance behind a buih,.
from whence he could hear a· perfeCt concert of fuch exquifite mufic as.
he never before heard; and in the upper part he heard tomcthing very
harih ·and fhrilllike a reed, but, as it was managed,, did g~ve a particular
grace to the rcil:.
About a quarter of jlt year after he can1e again to n1e, .and:,vithed he hnd
taken tny. advice, fot~ he thought he had ·done that \vhich \\'Ould cofi: him
his life, and \Vhid1 he did heartily rcpeut of; and indeed his eyes and
. countenance iho\ved a great alteration.. J. afked him \vhat he had done.
He told me that, being. be,vitched to his acquaintance, he refolvcd to pro·
ceed farther in this art, a~d to hnve fotne familiar fpirit at his comn1and,,
according to the direelions of his book, 'vhich \Vere as follo\YS :--

co.ntinued there in a.[,veat till break of day, and th~n they left him, and
from t1;u~t time he W(\S never well as long as he lived. In his ficknefs he
came frequently to Brifiol, to c~nfult with Mr. Jacop, an apothecary in

This poor deluded young man, it is very apparent, had no evil defign,
but entered into this infernal affociation for no other motive than to gru...
t ify au idle cu~iofity; the coniequencc of \vhich \Vas that he under\veut
the moll: indcfcribablc tcr·ror and fright, \vhich at firft deprived hi1n
of his hca1th, and eventually of his life. 1 have no doubt but the cir-
cumfiance of dijhflicving the txijlcllce of fpirits (\vhich I apprehend
is more or lcfs the cafe \Vith ~oft people) \Va3 the firfi, if not the
only, induccrnent that urged him to tnakc the experiment. There nrc
many infiances of a fimilar kind, equally \Veil founded, and as fatal
in their confequences, \Vhich might be here adduced, to fho\v the dx:cad-
ful effetls of being led "'vay by a prefumptuous or a hardened mind, to
difuelicve the \\'Ord of God revealed in a thoufand paffages of fcripture,
\V here this infernal intercourfe is ferioufiy forbidden ; but 1Jincercly hope,
nnd have reafon to believe, that this cxaanple \vill operate as a fufficicnt
bar againft all fimilar enquiries, where it is once read, and the melan-
. choly confequences duly confidered. Wherefore Jet me entreat all my
readers to fiifle every inordinate dcfire, "'hich might unguardedly prompt
then1 to folicit an intercourfe ~ith fuch dangerous company; not to at-
ternpt the conjuration of fpirits of any defcription or order ; no, not eveJt
out of joke or bravado, or for fun or frolic ; for the devils are continu-
ally going about "jee!li11g 'l.uho1n they 1nay devour;" they are ever on the
watch, and ready at hand to catch at every thought that might be tur.Red
to their purpofe; and, when they have once fo far fuccceded as to occupy
the fmalleft place in the rr1ind, I fear it \vill prove no ea(v tafk to difpof-
fcfs tbc1n. ·
Let it ever be remembered, that the firfl: afiaults of \vicked tpirits
are ufually made upon our fenfual defires, \Vhereby they infinuate tbero-
felves into our very appetites, enticing our inclinations, and depraving
the tnoral faculties of the mind; until they become, as it \vere, incorpo-
rated \vith our nature, 1eading us in!enfibly fro1n folly to vice, until a

as fpiritual compaCl. \vith the devil. 'rhefe confiderations, 1econded by

plore the fpirit\.1al and infernal kingdoms, and to expofe_the iniquity, as
"'ell as to explain the theory, of f:1n1iliarity or con1patl \Vith them. And
in. doing this, I have {crupuloufly avoided giving thl! elfential fi>rms :tnd
