  		      2259.        Josefina M Mother NDE       6/26/2010.      Secondhand NDE 4658.       From Venezuela. Original in Spanish, translated by English by Simon.      During an emergency operation for a burst appendix, she suddenly found herself positioned as an outside observer in a corner of the operating room. From there she watched the entire process...  
   NDE from burst appendix.   

    2258.        Diane C NDE       6/21/2010.      NDE 4626.       From Canada. Original in French, translated by English by Kathy.      At that instant, I felt myself floating in the air, lying horizontally about three-quarters of the way up, that is to say a few feet from the ceiling. I wasn't moving at all and none of my senses was working. I was very content and would have wanted to stay there it was so peaceful. I was in danger but didn't know it at all. I saw a big tunnel right in front of me, very near and it was very, very brightly lit. The tunnel was at least ten feet in diameter and was just a few meters away from me. The light was very, very intense. It seemed to have a very thin veil in front of the entrance and there was an extremely bright light behind it.  
   NDE from allergic reaction to medication.   

    2257.        Tami C Probable NDE       6/20/2010.      Probable NDE 4493.             Despite all the frantic comments, and people rushing about, I felt nothing, but pure peace and no pain, and felt like I was floating. I remember thinking, 'I just want to go to sleep.' A voice quickly said, 'No, it's not your time.'  
   Probable NDE due to pulmonary emboli.   

    2256.        Jean E NDE       6/20/2010.      NDE 4492.       From New Zealand.      They wheeled me out of the birth suite and to the operating theatre, and it was then I left my body and started to float. The ceiling disappeared and I was looking at myself being wheeled along on a trolley from a great height down what seemed to be an endless corridor. I felt extremely calm, and found the whole experience wonderful and life changing. I kind of plopped back into my body when the anesthetist started giving me an injection.  
   NDE due to bleeding after delivery. Interesting that her NDE ended when anesthesia for emergency surgery was started.   

    2255.        Cindy D NDE       6/20/2010.      NDE 4491.             I then remember 'standing before GOD'. I can only describe GOD as a huge ENERGY presence radiating LIGHT so intense and brilliant you could not look. Even though I had a sensation of 'standing before God' I was not in a body or any type of form. There were many other 'PRESENCES' around as well, but again nothing to 'describe' as far as visual or audio goes, just an awareness. I was aware of the presence of LOVE. I was 'told' that 'All there is - is LOVE. There is nothing to fear. All that matters is LOVE.' LOVE being so pure again there are not really 'words'.  
   NDE due to horseback riding accident with head injury.   

    2254.        Laura S NDE       6/20/2010.      NDE 4490.             After that I was looking down and watching. It was a cold winter day but I was not cold or warm. I could see them take me from the car and put me in an ambulance I watched them but was okay and happy but somehow I know I had to return and I did in the ambulance.  
   NDE at age five due to auto accident.   

    2253.        Leigh H Probable NDE       6/20/2010.      Probable NDE 4486.             I was alone in my room and suddenly there was the appearance of a figure in bright light at the foot of my bed. It was so bright it awakened me. The figure approached the side of my bed and took my hand; he then said 'It will be alright.'  
   Probable NDE associated with heart attack from retired minister.   

    2252.        Jim W NDE       6/20/2010.      NDE 4485.             I saw my life pass before me in rapid succession. Suddenly, it was like my body was physically lifted out of the water and was now standing on solid soil.  I saw my mom and dad playing in the water, not noticing that I had almost drowned.  At some point after this, I had a remembrance or knowledge of being in heaven before I was ever born, and being offered a selection of a time to come live on earth. I chose the time after WWII because I thought it would be a great time to live.  
   NDE at age 6 due to drowning.  Shared 58 years later.  Interesting remembrance of pre-mortal existence.   

    2251.        Adeline N NDE       6/20/2010.      NDE 4481.             I went through a tunnel with a light at the end, and came out to a beautiful scene.  I was suddenly aware of two friends who had passed recently.  They were asking (beckoning) me to come over.  I didn't hear voices but I heard them.  I must have known what that meant because I said I couldn't come now because I had three little kids at home who needed me.  
   NDE due to post-operative complication.  Shared 61 years later.   

    2250.        Tim B NDE       6/20/2010.      NDE 4479.             The next thing I remember, vividly, is a scene of the ambulance and three people working on me. It was a real scene viewed abnormally and I remember hearing voices, but not really caring very much. I heard the people restoring my vital signs and one of them said, 'He's paralyzed.' What was strange is that I observed this whole thing from a perspective of looking down onto my body and the back of the ambulance from behind and above, about twelve feet or so above and twenty feet or so behind the ambulance. It was very vivid, I could see and hear everything, but felt detached.  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    2249.        Paul F Probable NDE       6/20/2010.      Probable NDE 4476.             In my private hospital room after surgery I first saw my room fill with light - then, I felt a Wonderful Love pour over me - I was in ecstasy. I don't know how long this lasted as time was irrelevant.  
   Probable NDE following surgery by former minister.   

    2248.        Tammy F NDE       6/20/2010.      NDE 4474.       From the UK      Although I couldn't actually see my feet in my head, I was aware that I was out of my body, looking down at my own body - but standing, not laying prone. My body lay crumpled on the floor. I was wearing all white clothes in my new state. I looked left to the front door, trying to get my bearings and not understanding what I was seeing. I then looked right to the back door, which was open from where my ex-partner had ran, thinking I was dead. I had an unbelievable feeling of warmth and love.  
   NDE due to strangulation.   

    2247.        John H Probable NDE       6/20/2010.      Probable NDE 4472.             I viewed myself (out-of-body), lying on a stone pedestal in a warmly-lit cave. Although not even knowing why I was in this position, having no memory of the accident, I thought to myself, 'Do I really want to go back to that crap?' I answered 'No', and the voice of my maternal Grandmother, nothing visual, just her very distinctive voice, to whom I was close, responded, 'John, you've got to go back!' I walked through a void, came to a singular white light, hanging adjacent to a black, seemingly felt-covered garage door with no windows or handles. My perception is that I spent about a total of two minutes at this door, turned perpendicular, walked away - and woke up to the doctor!  
   Probable NDE due to auto accident.   

    2246.        Alison M NDE       6/20/2010.      NDE 4471.             At the time I had this thought, it felt like large hands were laid on both my shoulders from behind, almost in a comforting manner, and I felt the most amazing sense of peace come over me. I knew I was at the end and I was okay with it. I didn't have flashbacks or any time to think of what I was leaving behind. I let out the most relaxed sigh of my life and it was as if I slipped out of myself into a comforting darkness. I still tell people to this day that it was the most peaceful moment of my life.  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    2245.        Ray G NDE       6/20/2010.      NDE 4469.             Then I entered a state of complete calmness. I realized I was dying and wasn't afraid of it in any way. I started reflecting about my family and that I would miss them and that this was such a silly way to die. I seemed to be just entering a peace yet I was thinking clearly and calmly as I was bouncing down the river. I almost didn't want to come back.  
   NDE due to drowning.   

    2244.        Jimmy W Probable NDE       12/19/2009.      Probable NDE 22232.             Then one night the roaring and the sensation of drowning was much worse. Then I was above the bed looking down in the dimly lit room at my mother and another lady, with me lying in the bed glistening with sweat and looking very tired.  The next instant I was outside looking down from above at my house.  I slowly started to move higher, away from my house looking back as the house grew smaller.  At some point, I stopped ascending and as I hovered there, I was aware that I had no physical body and there was no sound.  It was as though only my eyes had left.  I don't remember being afraid and I thought, so this is what my house looks like from high above.  
   Probable NDE from rheumatic fever.   

    2243.        Donald W NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 22230.             Just after they smashed my face with a rock, I felt myself raising from a horizontal position and slowly rising from the surface to an upright position. Floating, so it seemed, completely aware of what was happening. Although I could see nothing I could feel every part of my body down to my waist. Although in the dark I seemed to know which way was forward or backward. In essence, gravity and three dimensions seemed to still be in play. I noticed an utter peace and feeling of non-concern and was of a blissful state I will never forget. I was fully aware what was happening to me and then I thought of my soon to be wife, asleep at Kona Shores waiting for me to come home and I remember asking myself what she would do now.  
   NDE due to criminal attack.   

    2242.        Joyce O NDE       6/20/2010.      NDE 4468.             I could hear and see the doctors talking. I heard my mother, John and Dolly, my brother-in-law and sister. I was in a state of wonderful peace where there was a very bright light starting out like the top of a huge ice cream cone and ending at a point. My soul began to move very quickly through the light to the end of the point. There was a figure at the end of the point with outstretched arms. All of a sudden, there was total blackness.  
   NDE due to suicide attempt with medication overdose.   

    2241.        Sue E NDE       6/20/2010.      NDE 4466.             The next thing I remember I was looking down at myself. It was as if I was on the ceiling. I could see them still sticking needles in me to start even more IVs. I saw there were at least four bottles of fluids hanging and going wide open. I remember them asking for blood and hanging that. I could not feel any of this and did not have the severe pain in my kidney area. My mother came in the room and I remember thinking how beautiful she was, and how well dressed, but how awful the camel wool dress she was wearing looked on her. I have such a clear memory of the shoes, purse, dress she was wearing. I was devastated at how upset she looked and it was as if I could feel how she felt.  
   NDE due to gunshot injury.   

    2240.        Jill C NDE       6/20/2010.      NDE 4464.       From the UK.      I was in a place of incredible light.  This was not the sort of light we are used to on earth.  There were wonderful patterns and golden lights enveloped me.  At the same time, I was enveloped in the most incredible knowledge of unconditional and benevolent love.  
   NDE due to kidney failure.   

    2239.        Alex A NDE       6/20/2010.      NDE 4463.             I felt like I was made out of energy and air. I raised up my arms and hands so I could see them. They had a very slight glow to them. They were not flesh, but energy and air like. They were not see-through. My arms still had hands and fingers. I opened and closed my hands to make fists. At this point, they had pulled my body out of the water and laid it against a tree. Upon seeing my body lying there, I started to hate not being in my body. At this point, I was floating about forty feet up. Every thought was I hate being like this, I have to get back into my body somehow.  
   NDE at age eleven due to drowning.   

    2238.        Jennifer W NDEs       6/20/2010.      NDE 4462.             Suddenly, I found myself in a dark place and two beings of very white light, one male; one female came and held me in their arms. It was the first time in my life I had ever experienced love. They held me for a very long time. They told me that God is love, something I had no knowledge of. I feel like they were my true parents, my spiritual parents. I was so confused, what is this love, who is this God you are talking about. I didn't want to come back, they told me I had too.  
   NDEs at age three to five due to abuse.   

    2237.        James C NDE       6/20/2010.      NDE 4460.             Arriving there I first saw someone that looked a little like me.  When I asked who this person was, I was told it was my brother. At that time, I never knew I had a brother that had died. Soon, we were joined by two other people who were introduced as another brother and sister, a set of twins that had also died. I met and saw many of my bloodline down through the ages.  
   NDE due to illness at age eight. Was declared dead. Account shared sixty-three years later.   

    2236.        Courtney NDE       6/19/2010.      NDE 4459.             I lost consciousness, then I felt myself rise up, and I was looking at myself. I could hear the doctors and nurses calling me and I could see my husband and my new baby. My hubby was looking so helpless. The room looked slightly different, like it was hazy. I keep yelling, 'I am here, I am right here!' but no one could hear me.  
   NDE due to blood loss during childbirth. (JL note: the drug given was most likely epinephrine, not ephedrine.)   

    2235.        Perry D Probable NDE       6/19/2010.      Probable NDE 4458.             I started to rise up off the bed, peaceful. I saw a beautiful light all around me, going up like a tunnel. I heard music being played by two angels. Harps were strumming. Finally, I heard a voice asking me, 'Are you ready?' It was a deep male voice. I remember saying' No, I'm not ready.' Right then, I started on a descent back to a bed. I just remember, no fear, the most peaceful state ever. There was beautiful, calming music.  
   NDE due to motorcycle accident. Interesting that experience is the only thing he remembers during a period of amnesia.   

    2234.        David M NDE       6/19/2010.      NDE 4457.             The strangest thing that I recall (as if it happened yesterday), was that, although these medical people were suddenly working frantically to revive me, that I had no concern at all for my wellbeing as I knew that I was okay throughout the entire episode. I found myself suspended about four feet or so above all this activity and immersed in bright light beyond me, but somewhat equally as bright to my sides as well. I was very much at peace and was dumbfounded about what all the confusion was on the medical table (upon which I was physically lying), below me. I distinctly recall my thoughts of, 'Well if you doctor's would just do this (or that) that I would in fact be fine.' Of course I have no medical background but at that moment it was clear to me what they were doing wrong.  
   NDE due to illness.   

    2233.        Gary T NDE       6/19/2010.      NDE 4456.             All of a sudden, everyone was gone and there was this bright, bright light (all I could think of was from what I heard about the bright light that this was it) so I said aloud, 'OH SHIT!' Then one of the nurses that were standing next to my head said to me, 'WHAT!'  
   Probable NDE due to heart attack.   

    2232.        Shelly NDE       6/19/2010.      NDE 4455.             The only thing I remembered for my NDE was there were two or three hooded shadows facing me, one was trying to touch me and I kept slapping at whatever he was trying to grab me with. It didn't look like a hand but more like a hooded sleeve. The weird thing about my NDE is that I was GIGGLING while trying to slap it away, when I think I should have been scared!! I wasn't scared though. I couldn't get it out of my mind afterwards and was very depressed for months that I was met with a hooded creature.  
   NDE with atypical content due to truck accident.   

    2231.        Robert S NDE       6/19/2010.      NDE 4454.             I experienced a view of myself from outside of the shower on the bathroom floor looking back into the shower at myself lying there. As I looked up, I could see an image of an individual in a glowing gown. The image was slowly raising upward. As I panned up further I saw a very bright silver/metallic like button in the middle of the chest of this robe/gown. The robe/gown was lightly illuminated and the button was laser like in the center of chest. I noticed that as I panned up further the image had its hands stretched out to the sides with the palms up.  
   NDE due to fainting with head injury.   

    2230.        Winnie S NDE       6/19/2010.      NDE 4453.             Then I experienced darkness and then proceeded to the indescribably bright light. The scene was a pastoral setting with brilliant colors but not distinguishable as flowers or objects. Approaching me were beings that I can only describe as individual entities that appeared to be bright, not earthy beings, familiar but not identifiable to me. They welcomed me and the light presence gave a feeling of love and peace and knowing that I have never felt before. The communication was not in words but in thoughts.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    2229.        Jeff W NDE       6/19/2010.      NDE 4452.             When I saw the car front end about two feet away everything positive in my life ran through my brain like a high speed camera. The next thing I could remember was that I was an entity in the sky. As the entity, I had no thoughts about the actual person who was in the accident. The feelings I had of the entity was that it was powerful and somewhat all knowing. Even though I turned into this entity, I felt no connection between who I am as a human and whom the entity was.  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    2228.        Gay L NDE       6/19/2010.      NDE 4451.             I was aware of the doctors and nurses working on me at the time, I had a warm feeling and saw God. It was not a face only a bright, bright light. I asked God if I was dying, and when he only held me and did not answer me I knew that I was not going to die at that time. It was the most comforting time I have ever felt. I was not afraid in the least, I had no desire to go, but on the other hand no desire to stay. I saw one of my children and my dog who were at my home at the time.  
   NDE due to allergic reaction.   

    2227.        Karen A NDE       6/19/2010.      NDE 4450.             I found myself in a void; complete darkness. I had no sensory feedback: complete silence, darkness, no smells, no feelings, and yet a very strong awareness of only myself - as though I was watching myself from a close distance. My body was perfect, undamaged. I was overwhelmed by the total aloneness and had but one thought, 'This dark place I am in cannot be heaven and, therefore, I must get out.'  
   NDE due to auto accident. Interesting understandings from a frightening experience.   

    2226.        John S Probable NDE       6/19/2010.      Probable NDE 4449.             They put me on a ventilator and into a medically induced coma. I was near death, but not officially dead. I knew I was dying and was fighting to stay alive. I remember just feeling tired of fighting. I was half out of it all the time, I guess due to the medicine to keep me in a coma. All of a sudden, my alertness was greatly heightened and I was on an elevator going up. The doors opened and there were some people there. I didn't know them but I had a certainty that one of them was a relative of mine; he was in charge of my entire family line. There was another person there that was a person in charge. I was given the choice to stay on earth and live, or the suffering could end and I could go to a very comfortable, pain free, place. I thought about my children being left without a father and profound sadness settled over me as I knew that I would have to come back if it was up to me.  
   Probable NDE due to severe illness.   

    2225.        Linda A Mother NDE       6/19/2010.      Secondhand NDE 4448.             This is how mom related her experience to me: She felt like she was in a tunnel. At the end of a tunnel was a bright light. She kept moving toward that bright light. Once she got to the bright light, she felt a presence behind her and knew it was Jesus. In the light, she saw her father (my grandpa) and his brother (great uncle) sitting at a table. (They both had preceded her in death in the early 1970's.) She looked at grandpa and said, 'Dad, I want to come with you.' Grandpa turned around and spoke to someone - whom mom knew was God although she could not see him - and when he turned back to her, he said, 'It's not time.'  
   Mother’s NDE due to post-surgical complication, as told by daughter.   

    2224.        Gail D NDE       6/19/2010.      NDE 4447.             During my surgery, I awakened and was floating. I could see myself near the ceiling of the surgery room. I was pleased with my appearance and youth. I entered a tunnel near the side of the surgery room ceiling very cautiously, but kept one foot at the outside of the opening. I only wanted to look in. I looked up and saw a light at the end, which was very soft and moved back and forth. Some electrical currents ran through it and it was somewhat milky in appearance. It was as if some forms of life were in the currents.  
   NDE during surgery for tumor - heart stopped during surgery.   

    2223.        Greg L NDE       6/19/2010.      NDE 4446.             I felt an immediate attraction and curiosity about this state of where I was, and wanted more. The soothing mesmerizing beauty of the light captured my soul and gently I floated higher and higher. I drifted with purity, fully trusting, completely engrossed, full of energy, clear thinking and more alive and aware then at any time in my life.  
   NDE due to electrocution.   

    2222.        Ted S NDE       6/19/2010.      NDE 4445.             I was swimming in a pool and removed my life jacket. I then was trying to find the edge of the deep end when I slipped and went under the water. I tried to grab a woman's swimsuit; she felt it but seen nothing. I blacked out. When I come to, I am floating above the pool with a spirit or ghost beside me. I ask it why no one is helping me (I can see everyone around my body and hear everything they are saying, still thirty-two years later like it happened today)? The being floating with me tells me without moving its mouth or saying anything that, 'The world is not as loving as you think.'  
   NDE at age ten due to drowning.   

    2221.        Jeffrie D Probable NDE       6/19/2010.      Probable NDE 4443.             I kept watching the huge light over my bed and somehow I slipped off from the bed into warmth, wellness and felt happy and I was not afraid - didn't hurt; just drifting away. Suddenly it was as if something caught me and I opened my eyes and tried to move my left arm and couldn't because it was taped to a board with the needle delivering blood. I was SHOCKED because I had been away from there!  
   Probable NDE as a child.   

    2220.        Valerie H NDE       6/19/2010.      NDE 4441.             The operating room had windows very high toward the ceiling and there was a woman sitting on the tile sill. She was wearing a white drape and very pretty with short dark hair. She was smiling at me and I went over near her, watching what was happening below. She nodded to me and I took off like the speed of light down corridors of the hospital and into a room where my husband and mother were waiting. The room had a brown leather and metal recliner and my mother was buying a Dr. Pepper from the vending machine. She and my husband were talking.  
   NDE due to complication of c'sarian section surgery.   

    2219.        Nathan I NDE       6/19/2010.      NDE 4440.       From the Philippines.      I saw a bright light and had fast flashbacks of the faces of my offices at Philippine National Bank. Then I woke up with people helping me go to the hospital just beside our house at Sta. Ana, the St. Anne's Hospital. I remember that I saw my body on the pavement from above when I was unconscious.  
   NDE due to being hit by van. He is an attorney in the Philippines.   

    2218.        Larry C NDE       6/19/2010.      NDE 4436.             Suddenly, I was in what I call the white room. I found myself above looking down at my mangled self under the collapsed air stair. No voices, no ghostly forms just a very pleasant experience. Then my name being called by my landlord - who told me later that when he walked into the hanger and saw me mangled under the pile of steel, he threw up. He said that he hadn't seen anything like that since WWII.  
   NDE due to three thousand pounds of material falling on him.   

    2217.        Joseph L NDE       6/19/2010.      NDE 4435.             It was at this time that I noticed that I was floating above my car a few feet. I remember vividly saying to myself this must be what dying is all about. I was feeling EUPHORIC, it was an absolutely incredible feeling. I could see myself in the driver's seat, bloody hair, floating higher yet, with people gathering around the accident. I was no longer a few feet above the car. I was more like fifty or sixty feet above the car and it was at this point that I noticed that I had no arms or legs and I could not see any other part of my body, but my thinking was very clear and my feeling still EUPHORIC. It was the greatest feeling I have ever experienced in my entire life.  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    2216.        Louis L FDE       5/16/2012.      FDE 16040.       From Canada      The Earth was so beautiful. I remember seeing the large brown areas, the continents and thinking the color was wrong. I expected the land to be green like the mountains where I lived. There was so much was brown. I realized that with different climates, not everything was green. The oceans were amazing, so large, and the clouds were everywhere in different shapes. I turned to look around and saw stars, like you would see in the night sky, but there were so many more of them and they were so bright. And also so beautiful that for a moment I forgot about the Earth. One of the stars started to become larger and seemed to move towards me. The light from the star was very bright. Within the light, I could make out a human shape, a staff, and possibly a robe. I could not make out the facial features because the light was so bright, but I don’t have a sense that I was looking at a man or a woman. I had a sense of a benevolent intelligence, and gender wasn’t relevant. There was an intense feeling of joy and safety. This new place was safe for a distressed child.  
   Fear death experience from a fall that happened as a child.   

    2215.        Ralph B NDE       6/4/2010.      NDE 4429.             My mother came to me being held by a man with a plaid colored skull cap. She told me I would marry, have two daughters, and my girlfriend (whom we had never met) would break her leg... It turns out the man with a red beard was my Great Grandfather, a rabbi who by the touch of his hand could heal the sick.  
   NDE due to boiler explosion and burns.   

    2214.        DeeRay G NDE       6/4/2010.      NDE 4428.             It seemed like I was knocked through myself and it was sweat and swaying. My wife was at the sink and I told her I felt weird. I turned to her and she knew that I was having a heart attack. She set me down. As she did this, I started to float up. My mind was racing fast as I thought of my mom who passed away thirty years ago.  
   NDE due to heart attack.   

    2213.        Grace N Probable NDE       6/4/2010.      Probable NDE 4430.             I was given sleeping pills and after taking them I awoke and felt much time had passed so I took more. I felt I was in a room with bright white walls. I saw no walls but felt they were there. There was what I felt to be an authoritative being in the room with me. I didn't see him but felt it was a man. I felt so much love, peace, goodness. It felt I was wrapped in this love. I was raised by loving parents but this was far above anything I had ever known. Suddenly I was jarred by a voice saying, 'Do you want to stay or go with me?' It was like the voice had spoken a few times but I didn't hear it so now it was a strong voice. I wanted to go so badly; but I was a single mother with four small children. I started to try to explain this and how much I wanted to stay in this love.  
   Probable NDE due to accidental sleeping pill overdose.   

    2212.        Tony B NDE       5/30/2010.      NDE 4424.             My surroundings were filled with light and I was floating looking down on my body, my relatives who were present at the time of the accident and the paramedics. I felt peaceful and simply observed as if from the ceiling of the room (kitchen) where I was.  
   NDE at age two due to burns. Shared fifty-eight years later.   

    2211.        Tim D NDE       5/30/2010.      NDE 4423.             After I passed out at the end of my bed I floated out of my body, up and over my body somewhere near the ceiling. It was light in my room and as I was floating I notice my arms were out stretched and I recall thinking I could feel the oxygen flowing through my body, I thought how cool,  I don't have to breath, the air goes right through me. I also noticed the temperature; it was like summer time, those rare nights when the outside temperature is exactly the same as your body temperature.  
   NDE due to unconsciousness from multiple illnesses.   

    2210.        Michael C NDE       5/30/2010.      NDE 4422.             Suddenly, a warmth overcame me and I felt a total calmness. When I was about to open a door at the end of a white hallway, an alarm brought me out of my bliss.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest. Multiple NDEs in a short time.   

    2209.        Hilde B Probable NDE       5/30/2010.      Probable NDE 4419.             Feelings of belonging. She was part of all there is. She was home.  
   Probable NDE shared in the form of a poem at age 84.   

    2208.        Steve W Probable NDE       5/30/2010.      Probable NDE 4418.             At that moment all the pain I felt was gone, the weight of the world lifted. It started like floating in a hot tub and quickly beyond anything I have ever felt or imagined. My body began to float up and I was aware of the angel the color of the room and the now empty bucket. This was and remains today the greatest experience of my life. The absence of weight and pain, pain one doesn't even know is there. I can remember thinking this is where I want to be.  
   Probable NDE due to motorcycle accident.   

    2207.        Jerry M NDE       5/30/2010.      NDE 4417.             I was completely conscious from the moment I found myself a hundred feet above my car accident and realized I was looking at myself in the car. I knew immediately I was dead and several questions came to me and was answered at the same time they were asked.  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    2206.        Kathy W NDE       5/30/2010.      NDE 4416.       From Australia.      All this time I felt like I was accelerating toward the light and as I approached I felt myself unfold like a flower, although I had no body. As I unfolded, I felt it, the Love, which was like nothing I have ever experienced before. Even now, I cry when I talk about it as my system feels like it's going to overload from just the memory. I was enveloped by this light and felt one with everything, all seeing, all knowing. It certainly wasn't what I understood of God as an entity, but maybe it was better. It gave new meaning to that saying that God is Love. The love was like an energy that connected every molecule in the universe.  
   NDE at childbirth.   

    2205.        Chris W FDE       5/30/2010.      FDE 4415.       From Canada.      I'm not sure if time slowed down, or that my thoughts and cognitive processes were so incredibly fast. As I fell toward the ground in the space of what might have been two minutes, it is as though my whole life was compressed and replayed in the blink of any eye. I remember two or three distinct images of the whole experience and the rest was just a blur. It was as if my mind was operating in two spaces, in one part, I was trying to control the helicopter, and in the other, I was having the playback experience. In the logical part of my mind I had come to the realization that if the wind shear situation did not abate, I would crash and be killed. In a distant and disembodied way I was wondering if it would be painful. During the event, I was not afraid.  
   Fear death experience during near helicopter crash.   

    2204.        Manon L Probable NDE       5/5/2010.      Probable NDE 16037.       From the Netherlands.      As a seven or eight week old infant I almost died of sudden infant death syndrome. My mother told me that she went into the room to feed me and that I had turned blue and felt limp. She felt something heavy fly away through the room. She called my father who picked me up and patted me and told me to come back.  The next thing I was crying.  They kept me for observation in the hospital for some time, but I was ok after that.  The memory that I have always known, and I am almost thirty five, is that of a bright light.  It was like looking into the sun but not sharp to the eyes, coming from that source. There was a feeling of encouragement.  To these events and feelings I have always connected my wish to do something that is of real use to other people.  Growing up, I didn't have the words to describe that memory, feeling, and wish. Until recently, I have never heard people in my surroundings speak about such a thing in their lives. When my mother told me the story of what happened when I nearly died, I put one and one together and realized what had probably happened.  
 
      2203.        Paul L Probable NDE       5/11/2010.      Probable NDE 4414.             During the experience, I was a spirit floating in a void above my body. I could see my body lying in bed. I was moving toward this Gateway that had a bright light coming from it. I looked back at my body and then at the Gateway and it became clear to me that if I went into the Gateway I would not go back to my body. I choose life.  
   Probable NDE from Sepsis. Interesting distinction between the hallucinations he had been having and this experience.   

    2202.        Charles D NDE       5/11/2010.      NDE 4411.             Then there was no light and I was floating above my body. It looked like it was an orange or bold color. I thought for a minute, 'Oh I am on the other side.' Then I heard the words 'leave me.' From that moment, I saw my body again. I said to myself, 'Wow, I'm floating and oh I don't hear that stupid ringing in my ears.' Then I zoomed back into my body. 'Whoa, was I dead?' Sara said that my heart stopped, I stopped breathing, and let out a gasp of air.  
   NDE from low blood-pressure.   

    2201.        John C NDE       5/11/2010.      NDE 4410.             'He can't stay here,' I saw the old man say. It was his voice I heard earlier. 'He's got to go back.' Go back? Back where? It seemed that the woman and old man were engaged in a conversation about me, but all I could think about was where I could be going and where I came from. It seemed all I had to do to be with those people was 'project' or 'wish' myself there. But this 'back' business bothered me to the point of distraction.  
   NDE from fainting.   

    2200.        Joke P Probable NDE       5/10/2010.      Probable NDE 4532.       From the Netherlands, original in Dutch translated to English by Annelies.      While I have these thoughts, I'm being sucked in further. Slowly I float upwards into the beam of light, which is getting narrower and brighter. My eyes and body are drawn towards it, and I let myself go completely. I'm moving in an infinite oasis of peace and safety. I'm floating slowly through a space of intense peacefulness, in a soft color of grey/green. It embraces me. I'm part of it. I'm one with it. The voices are fading. I hear them in the background, but they don't reach me. About halfway I reach other surroundings, where the soft grey/green color becomes bright, light grey. It's more beautiful than where I was before. At this point, I stop. I see an almost invisible boundary between the spot where I am and where the beautiful, bright light begins. I'm at the end and at the beginning. The doorway looks inviting.  
   Probable NDE from going unconscious when head hit the concrete.   

    2199.        Begona VA NDE       5/9/2010.      NDE 4565.       From Venezuela. Original in Spanish translated to English by Simon.      I felt no pain, everything went dark all of a sudden and I found myself ascending a tunnel at great speed. At its end, there was light, but I never got that far. I heard someone's voice from behind me calling me by name repeatedly.  
   Beginnings of a NDE from childhood.   

    2198.        Etienne NDE       4/24/2010.      NDE 4584.       From France. Original in French translated to English by Kathy.      I learned what we become after death and of course my life is completely different now.  
   NDE from heart attack.   

    2197.        Soledad NDE       4/23/2010.      NDE 4547.       From Spain. Original in Spanish translated to English by Simon.      The pain and suffocation seemed to have disappeared.  'Someone' was approaching me from behind and I could sense this being on the left side. He or she told me not to be afraid, and explained that they had come to take me away. When I heard this, I felt joy and relief.  
   Child NDE from pneumonia.   

    2196.        Jacque M NDE       4/23/2010.      NDE 4570.       From Canada. Original in French translated to English by Kathy.      Suddenly, I'm surprised to find myself fully awake and feel a great joy, blissfulness; I'm in a space/time that in no way resembles life on Earth. I understand that I've died. I smile with wonder and say to myself, 'Oh, it's like this!' I don't see anything much, and heard nothing either, but I feel an intense well-being, a sense of wonder in an immaterial world, exalting and serene, that seems to function according to superior values, entirely unknown in the Earth world. It isn't made up of individuals and I can melt into it, I already belong.  
   NDE from surgery complications.   

    2195.        Trevor J Probable NDE       4/23/2010.      Probable NDE 4539.       From New Zealand      It was then that I noticed that behind the three was a door and through the gap at the bottom of this door I could see a most intense light. The light did not spill into the room where I was but was totally contained on the other side of the door except what I could see through the gap. It was the whitest light I had ever seen, much brighter than any light on earth, and yet it did not hurt my eyes. I was still floating at the ceiling all of this time as well. I was fascinated by the presence of this light, it was though it was a 'being' of some sort and it radiated everything that was good and I still experienced the same beautiful feelings.  
   This book details a probable NDE from cardiac arrest.   

    2194.        Gayle V NDE-Like Experience       4/23/2010.      NDE-Like Experience 4396.             All I remember from that point of time was traveling at a high rate of speed upward through a darken tunnel. I had not made this decision; I was within the Will of another. This tunnel was a winding spiral of circling ribs; I was being propelled upward through. It reminded me of an umbilical cord through which I was being propelled, not touching any of the surrounding membranes but at high speed moving ever upward, leaving the darkened world behind and entering a world of a greater light. The light became even brighter as a moved upward. Only a moment later, I stopped. Surrounding me was the presence of warm radiant light; it was holding me, comforting me, loving me, and enclosing me in perfect rapture, an area of pure soothing brilliant golden white light. I was totally at peace.  
   NDE-Like experience from exhaustion.   

    2193.        Juan M NDE       4/8/2010.      NDE 4530.       From Spain. original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon.      I remember seeing myself in a place where everything was light. I did not look behind me but I noticed that the light shone on everything around me. I could not differentiate between the floor and the ceiling, that is, everything was light, a very bright light, strange but not uncomfortable. I did not know how I had come to be in this place, but it has always seemed to me that I came there at incredible speed, as if I had been through a tunnel or passageway at immense velocity, and ended up there, but this is just a feeling, as I could not see any passageway or tunnel.  
   NDE from fainting. Interesting example of earthly events 'intruding' into NDE.   

    2192.        Cheryelle B NDE       4/6/2010.      NDE 4406.             I then felt the most peace I have ever felt in my life. My mother was there to meet me and told me I had to come back that I was not through.  
   The beginnings of an NDE.   

    2191.        Paul C NDE       4/6/2010 &amp; 4/22/22.      NDE 4404/9383.             I was surrounded by a very, very intense white light, and it seemed to crackle, almost 'electrically,' so to speak. The light encircled my form; it wrapped around the contour of my body, as I recall. All this was against an extremely dark background. It was unclear where I was or what kind of room or space I was in, other than the darkness, then the bright light surrounding my form, sitting up at ninety degrees and screaming loudly. I cannot say with certainty if I was positioned slightly higher than the view of myself on the table, but I think I might have been. I was certainly not below that level, and definitely not 'floating' above my body. I was seated comfortably in a chair, simply dispassionately and objectively observing what was taking place.  
   NDE from heart attack.   

    2190.        Fifi T Probable NDE       4/6/2010.      Probable NDE 4402.             To describe further, I was standing in space, but I did not see a horizon. There was no atmosphere as there is on earth, no limited vision or degradation of colors farther out. There was no sun. Light was emitted in everything and out of everything. The city looked something like pictures I have seen of Jerusalem, the city glowed, every molecule was lit, I felt this light in me, part of me, and I was part of it. In this light, I felt incredible, indescribable love and forgiveness that only God can give.  
   Probable NDE from sleep apnea.   

    2189.        Christopher H NDE       4/6/2010.      NDE 4401.             The horror of trying to breathe but having all air squeezed from my chest while wide awake haunted me for years and still does to a lesser degree. But amazingly once I blacked out, I remember flying and being so joyful. I was so happy and there were some loving presences there next to me. At the time, I thought it might be Jesus but there was no name and the bright white light was the main feature. This was many years ago but as I write this much comes right back to me. I recall definitely NOT wanting to leave this loving place. I felt so happy and wanted.  
   Child NDE from car accident.   

    2188.        Florene W NDE       4/6/2010.      NDE 4398.             I remember as I floated upward many tiny lights that twinkled all around me and I was just 'out in space'. I was not afraid or anything like that.  Looking back now, I did not even question anything. All of a sudden, I was in the most beautiful place that I have ever seen (and still have not seen).  I was looking down into a beautiful 'stream' of flowing water - the water was a blue that I have never seen before, it was coming down off of a small little cliff and the water, when it hit, sounded like my fine crystal when you 'ping' it with you fingernail.  
   NDE from childbirth complications.   

    2187.        Viva T NDE       4/6/2010.      NDE 4397.             Then there was One star of incredible dimension, brightness, beauty, majesty. As I was drawn toward it (combined with earnest choice), I could see complex shapes and colors. (Words don't describe it – I have tried to draw it.) I could see dimensions where the colors and shapes were overlaid one on another (like translucent immense precious stones fitted together to form a complex multi - doesn't describe - dimensional impression of a Most Loving Being that drew me to Him, invited me in, and pointed the Way to the Light. ALL wisdom and love was conveyed via unheard thought transmission from that Being (Jesus?). That light was a yet far distant point that I immediately (in combination again of will and being drawn) directly myself to with all earnestness with the conscious goal of uniting with that light (or perish?). As I approached, the light grew larger, brighter, compelling until I was suddenly thrust into it (beyond a sense of boundary) with indescribable speed.  
   NDE described by Nurse with a PhD.   

    2186.        Khat H NDE       4/6/2010.      NDE 4394.             looking down at the surgery. I heard someone calling my name and when I finally focused on where it was coming from, I saw a tall white man that looked like the paintings of Jesus. I walked over to him and he gave me the feeling of calm and serenity the closer I got to him. When I finally reached him, he told me that I had to go back. I did not understand why I had to leave. He took my hand and told me 'It is not time for you to come to me Khat.' I began to cry and begged him to let me stay with him, but he refused. As he was comforting me, he led me back to the space above the operating table and told me that I still had many things to do before I could see him again.  
   NDE from childbirth complications.   

    2185.        Sammy M Possible NDE       4/6/2010.      Possible NDE 4393.       From Australia.      Left body, felt really warm and comfy, started heading for the Light when my voice said 'It is not your time, you have things to do.' Knowing that I had to get back into my body, I focused on the pain and suddenly I was back. A nurse said ' We lost you for a while.' I said, 'I know!'  
   Very brief possible NDE from an accident.   

    2184.        Joyce J Possible NDE       4/6/2010.      Possible NDE 4392.             All of a sudden, a very bright, white beam of light came down through the water and lit up the bottom of the pond in front of me, not right in front of me but just at a distance. A peacefulness came over me and I felt very light as if I were just quietly floating towards it, of course I was in the water with an inner tube around my hips. I remember being aware that I wasn't panicking (scared) or struggling anymore. I wasn't afraid of it; it was more that I was curious. I could see the plants and fish illuminated on the bottom of the pond by it; before the beam of light appeared I couldn't see anything.  
   Child possible NDE age seven from drowning.   

    2183.        Mabel G Probable NDE       3/27/2010.      Probable NDE 4391.             I flew through space in a tunnel with lights streaking on each side (my soul left my feet and proceeded upward through my head and out). I flew thousands of miles per second and felt protected from evil and harm by the colorful lights. At the end of the tunnel was a light, which was Jesus' robe.  Suddenly, I was standing in the valley of the shadow of death with a small stream of water running at my feet.  On the other side, facing me was Jesus! His hands were held out to me; his face expressed love.  
   Probable NDE from a difficult childbirth where she met Jesus!   

    2182.        Rebecca M NDE       2/18/2010.      NDE 16025.             Then, she found herself in a big hall. Something said her name, and a ‘Book of Knowledge’ opened to her name.  Images were projecting on to a wall of a time when she was a small girl.  There were conversations with others.  She could feel the emotions of others as they were feeling them.  She saw the effect that she had on other people.  It was like a life review.  She saw the good and the not so good effects that she had on others.  She realized that she had an effect on everything in the world.  Mostly, she learned to be kind and give love to others.  
   Interview with and NDEr.   

    2181.        Marilena R NDE       2/26/2010.      NDE 4442.             I was shown scenes from my life all at once - past, current, and future. I don't remember the exact details of what I saw, but the entire experience changed my life after that. I made up mind to do all the things I had always dreamt of doing, to forget about religious beliefs, to do good and help others, to not have any regrets when my time to go came, and to be true to myself above all else.  
   NDE from drowning.   

    2180.        Holly V NDE       2/26/2010.      NDE 4390.             The tunnel was surrounded by darkness, which was not surprising for some reason.  The darkness appeared to be infinite. Then as I flowed quickly through this shaft, I realized there was soft glowing light in the distance ahead. Maybe like city lights appear long before you can see the city, more like a glow reflecting off the darkness. Then as I looked to the side, I began to see images of my life (guess that is the life review).  
   NDE due to infection after miscarriage.   

    2179.        Tracy M NDE       2/26/2010.      NDE 4388.       From Canada      The place I was is a hill in Marysville where my grandmother used to pick sunflowers. The grass was so lush and so green. The air was so perfect, moving yet still. Colors had intensity I have never known. I could see and know all these things with my entire being. A dog's tail weaved through the tall grass. A beautiful fuzzy puppy wagged her tail at me.  
   NDE due to blood loss during delivery.  Inspiring reunion with her recently deceased pet dog.   

    2178.        Michael G NDE       2/26/2010.      NDE 4387.             Then I saw this large, golden orb in front of me, suspended in the blue. It was close enough to touch, but I didn't. Its surface undulated, like the sea - rising and falling. Immediately, I thought, 'This is the sun,' but then remember saying, 'I am so sorry.' Instantly, without word, I was corrected. This 'orb' in front of me was no 'thing,' it was a personality. I don't know what it was. It didn't speak to me. It just was so beautiful to look at and be with; I didn't want to leave its presence.  
   NDE due to drowning at age nine.   

    2177.        Ericka S NDE       2/26/2010.      NDE 4386.             I remember it was dark, pitch black. I am terrified of the dark in life but I had absolutely no fear. It was neither hot nor cold but I was aware of a tingle. I knew I was dead. I knew I had no body. I looked at myself and was there, but not. My son's father was there, he had committed suicide a few years before and at that time, we had been on terrible terms. All I felt from him was absolute love all I felt period was complete love and peace and knowledge like I was full.  
   NDE due to alcohol overdose and MDMA poisoning.   

    2176.        Dan A NDE       2/26/2010.      NDE 4385.             I had run out of oxygen. I was alone and scared in complete darkness when suddenly I saw a little tiny pinpoint of light. As I stared at it, the light became brighter and larger and closer like I was moving toward it, or it was coming to me very rapidly from a far distance away, until it was so large and bright it was like a wall of light. Proceeding into the light I was immediately filled with the light, the most amazing peace, warmth and joy! I have never felt such an amazing feeling ever in my life. My eyes adjusted to the brilliant bright light and I realized that I had entered into a magnificent splendid giant hall or building, the walls emanated this pure bright light and filled everything it touched so that there not a shadow, sad or mean thought could exist, just pure love and joy.  
   NDE due to being crushed by cement wall.   

    2175.        Madonna M NDE       2/26/2010.      NDE 4384.             I felt no sense of needing to breathe, or of cold, but recall initially noticing how dark it was, relative to the bright winter's day outside. Suddenly, I could see from above, myself falling. I will never forget the vision of myself in my yellow ski jacket and extra long striped scarf, my long blonde braids and scarf floating over my head. I was calm watching myself, no thinking anything strange of feeling anything but completely in control and serene. I spoke aloud these words: 'I'd better get back down there.'  
   NDE due to falling thru ice while ice-skating at age 9.   

    2174.        Esteban M NDE       2/26/2010.      NDE 4383.             The next thing I know is that I am standing in a field and the grass was the greenest I have ever seen. I also saw that the sky was the bluest I have ever seen. Then the clouds were the whitest I have ever seen. It was so peaceful and the sun was shining brightly, even though I did not see the sun. I could feel the wind against my skin. I remember that it was very calm and I felt so serene and at peace.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    2173.        David W NDE       2/26/2010.      NDE 4382.             After a week when I went to have half of my staples removed, I asked the surgeon if he played Mountain in the Operating Room. His response was the question, 'Looking down or the light?' He said that many of his patients have reported these events and yes indeed he did play a Mountain CD during the surgery.  
   NDE at time of open heart surgery- OBE over body and saw his heart restarted during surgery. Surgeon confirmed a song was played in the operating room that he was aware of.   

    2172.        Hal R NDE       2/26/2010.      NDE 4379.             I came to the end of this 'hallway' it opened up to an infinitely large space. In this space, there were an infinite amount of what I could describe would be souls communicating with each other simultaneously. I was in awe at the magnitude of thoughts being communicated between these souls. I could focus in on one area and pick out the 'conversation'. What I really mean was that thoughts were directly spread between these souls, no words were spoken. I did not see anything, including any light or darkness. I could just sense these communications and I was overwhelmed, not by fear but by joy.  
   NDE due to bicycle accident.   

    2171.        Michelle H NDE       2/26/2010.      NDE 4377.             All sound stopped. There was no feeling in my body. It was dark. I was not in a body. I was AWARE I was in the dark. I was aware that I was observing and actually thinking. I thought, 'Huh, that's it huh.' I experienced only a moment of fear before I faded back into a body full of pain.  
   NDE with void experience that left her ambivalent about the intent of God and the afterlife.   

    2170.        Chamisa H NDE       2/26/2010.      NDE 4376.             I observed a Being of Light instantly entering this holographic space.  When he came, I was washed with a flood of love and forgiveness for everyone and everything. I even loved the earth and all its beauty and the animals on the earth and 'felt' the spiritual process we are all in, and how we are literally tied together as brothers and sisters needing to be unified in love and care.  
   NDE due to accident and severe hemorrhage. Shared by retired nurse. Astonishing verified information received during NDE that she could not have otherwise known.   

    2169.        Tim V NDE       2/26/2010.      NDE 4375.             When I looked at them from close up, I could see into their brilliance. I could see their features. One of them was my grandmother and the other was my dad. They were made of light. It was them but much younger and more perfect. My grandmother proceeded to welcome me home, not to worry we will take good care of you were her exact words. This was not speech; it was more like telepathy. I really can't describe the overwhelming feeling of peace, love, joy and RELIEF!!! I was finally back home.  
   NDE due to illness with unconsciousness.   

    2168.        Maria F Probable NDE       2/26/2010.      Probable NDE 4374.             I felt as if I was above them, seeing them working on me. Next, I remember seeing my husband and five year old daughter in the room outside the operating room. They seemed upset. All of a sudden I was going through a dark tunnel, but with flashing speed, and straight ahead was a very bright!!! light. Then I was in a meadow with beautiful flowers surrounding me. The colors were so vibrant! I felt peace and love surround me. I looked to my left and there was a splendid man in a white robe, with shoulder-length hair, beard and mustache. Then he was in front of me. There was a bridge separating us, and he communicated in telepathy. I understood that I could go no further.  
   Probable NDE at childbirth.   

    2167.        Elizabeth L NDE       2/26/2010.      NDE 4372.             And space is exactly what it was. It was the color of Montana sky, had no walls, ceiling or any type of perimeters. There were a few very white clouds here and there and I recall looking around for some kind of tunnel or exit but at the same time hoping I could be in this place forever free of emotional and physical pain, or stress, it was fabulous indeed. But as I thought about being able to stay where I was, I heard a powerful voice, heard isn't exactly the right word. I seemed to feel/hear/sense it in my thinking part of my brain. It said, 'NO, not now, later, you have much yet to do.' I was sad to be back in the physical part of me and am still wondering what I should be doing.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    2166.        John D NDE       2/26/2010.      NDE 4371.             I was totally conscious, but didn't know where I was, totally void of light yet I could still see - I was aware of myself and I don't remember having a body, just a consciousness. I looked around or at the darkness, it was right in front of me and far away, then it was like looking at a black canvass with no beginning or end and it was silent, at first. Then sounds I really can't explain, I became aware of presences, coupled with the darkness becoming textured and streaked with ashen grays and a burning, scraping sound. I heard screaming and crying. I never saw what was causing it but with each streak I became more terrified and knew I wasn't in a good place, and whatever was trying to come 'through' the darkness, meant to do me harm.  
   NDE due to truck accident. Experience was frightening.   

    2165.        Matt E Probable NDE       2/26/2010.      Probable NDE 4370.             As I drifted out to the street, I looked at my neighbor's porch, laundry line, and the home next door with the Chevy parked in the driveway.  I figured Randy must have been off from work, often he worked nights. I started to drift down the road but the house at the end was not visible just a lighter area of fog like something out of twilight zone. As I got nearer, I came to the realization I did not want to go.  
   Probable NDE from apparent respiratory arrest from unknown cause.   

    2164.        Jon B NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4369.             We didn't speak verbally with mouths. Instead, it was telepathic. In my mind, I would receive a sentence or phrase from them and then I would interpret that as sound. The difference being that in the real world when we hear speech we hear each word one at a time. But in my experience I heard the words all at once. It was very strange but also very easy and familiar. From what I can gather, they were trying to gauge my state-of-mind. They asked me if I was all right and if I understood what had happened to me.  
   NDE at age three from drowning.   

    2163.        Joann P NDE       2/25/2010 & 7/4/2011.      NDE 4366/5263.             Following behind us were two Cherubs, very small, short curly hair, naked, neither sex, one was solid pink and the other one was solid purple. It was like they were trying to keep me entertained and they did. I was trying to catch or touch them with much laughter and giggles. They were fluttering around us like humming birds. The scenery changed to a beautiful landscape of green valleys and hills. To the left I could not see, but I could hear the laughter of children playing. I wanted to go there. I heard a voice in the distance saying, 'No! You're too young.'  
   NDE at approximately six months old from choking and passing out. One of the youngest age NDEs ever shared with NDERF.   

      2162.        Suzanne RP NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4365.             There was a light tunnel of light and I was in the light. I did not have to go to the light. I didn't hear anything around me. I saw at the end of the tunnel of light my maternal grandmother who had passed away in 1976 and I was in my mind reaching up to her to pull me up and she just shook her head. She didn't say anything. Then, the tunnel at her end closed and was black.  
   NDE from criminal attack at age seventeen.   

    2161.        Gary S NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4363.             I was walking towards these human shapes, I could not make out faces but everybody was like sort of waiting to greet me. I felt like I was coming back home and the feeling of happiness coming from the human shapes present was so overwhelming that I have never in my life felt so wanted and loved. In a morbid way, I was mad that I came back because I felt like I had known and loved them all my life. It felt like I was coming back to a place that was a part of me that made complete.  
   NDE from heart attack.   

    2160.        Alfred H NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4362.             It was completely dark and void of sounds. I 'felt' completely immersed in an emotional cacophony of positive feelings. I have never felt as good when in my earthly body. I am convinced that I was in the presence of the Holy Spirit, even though I don't know the 'why' of this. There was absolutely no concept of time, pain, sorrow, fear, or anything negative that is associated with the human experience.  
   Three NDEs from cardiac arrests.   

    2159.        Mark H Possible NDE       2/25/2010.      Possible NDE 4360.             I remember having an incredibly powerful fear of death before my surgery - a fear which vanished after my experience and has never returned. I had the nurses pray for me right before the surgery. I found myself in the presence of a heavenly light, which I was not allowed to enter, but only barely touch and observe. When it touched me, I was bathed in ethereal music. I not only heard this music, I became a part of it. There was life in the music - God was there. It flowed through me and me through it. There was more ecstasy in the music than any one single human could tolerate. I knew at that point that the music we play here on earth is simply a reflection of this 'source'. I felt more 'awake' than I had ever felt, as if this earthly life was but a dream and true consciousness happens after death.  
   Possible NDE during surgery. Remarkable description of encounter with unearthly music.   

    2158.        Robert B Probable NDE       2/25/2010.      Probable NDE 4358.             When all was seen I was again filled by this Goddess with tenderness until I again nearly burst and was told that, 'Every act of kindness matters.' Before I was sent back, I asked how long was I here and is this what it would be like for everyone else. I was told that I was there for seven years and that each person would see only what they could understand when they came to her. Some would see her as Jesus, some their fathers or moms, every imaginable deity as well.    
   Probable NDE due to surgery complication.   

    2157.        Mike K NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4356.             I remember seeing the ship from high up at least a hundred feet or more as the ship seemed small. I remember feeling as if I really didn't want to go back. The voice I heard left no doubt that I was to go back.  
   NDE due to debris from nearby plane crash.   

    2156.        Liv T Probable FDE       2/25/2010.      Probable FDE 4353.             I heard the most beautiful voice when I was out of my body 'Your name is Liv not Di.' Simple and funny I know that was my Angel's ways of reassurance as I had things to do still and they sent the man in the car to shield me, as well as allowing me to walk and talk and see the criminal that hit so he could be stopped. I know The Angels are humorous and loving and they have guided me throughout my life and they tell me always to keep things Light.  
   Auto accident. Interesting angelic encounter.   

    2155.        Mark K NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4352.             It was then that I realized I was out of my body about ten feet above the table looking down. That freaked me out a little and then my whole life flashed before me. It was like the scales of Justice. I could see the bad things on one side and the good on the other. I could no longer see me on the table, but I was on the bottom of a very beautiful colorful (like fire opal) blue, red, yellow translucent wall. As I floated to the top and looked over, there were five people standing on the bottom of the other side, dressed in white gowns.  
   NDE due to complication of surgery to manage shotgun injury.   

    2154.        Art L Probable NDE       2/25/2010.      Probable NDE 4351.             As I got closer to this light, I felt at peace. I felt love and knowledge. As I got closer to this bright light, I noticed the silhouettes of people with their backs toward me. As I got closer these two silhouettes, they turned to face me. I knew that they were my great uncle and aunt. I drifted past them as I approached this source of light, which grew brighter. I also felt like I knew the universe. I had an understanding of everything. Someone approached me from this light.  
   Probable NDE due to accidental overdose at age seventeen.   

    2153.        Ellen H NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4350.             I then went to a very beautiful place. There were people all about the same age, twenty-five to thirty.  They were walking in different colored long robes. There was a beautiful fountain, and the gate was one I could not get into. I wanted someone to let me inside. It was as if no one could see me. It appeared to be a place of learning. It was very beautiful. Next, I remember a male voice telling me, more in my soul than audibly, that I did not belong there yet.  
   NDE due to suicide attempt at age fifteen.   

    2152.        Michael O NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4349.             Coming out of the carnival and through the entrance was my kid sister Allison. I have never been so happy; I could not stop crying with joy. Allison had passed away in 1992 at the age of twenty-three from a brain aneurism. She was in Med School at the time with a very promising future. It was devastating for us. When Ali, approached me, I really knew I was home. We sat at a little table outside of the carnival talking for what seemed like forever. She was so wise and calm.  
   NDE due to kidney failure.   

    2151.        Joe NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4346.             I experienced a beautiful, tranquil light, feeling of total peace and serenity at the time of the accident.  
   NDE due to accident, very briefly described.   

    2150.        Oliver W NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4340.             I was transcending to a grey whitish light and started to travel through the tunnel. I was looking down the tunnel, which was transparent. I saw little black dots, I can only assume that these dots were nothing more than souls, these dots were everywhere and the cross over I can only compare it to the River Jordan when I got through the tunnel.  
   NDE due to insulin reaction.   

    2149.        Larry T NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4338.             I was in a tunnel with a light at the end of it, a very bright white light. I had always thought of a dark tunnel, but this one was more similar to what is described in the Kabala.  It was a geometrical tunnel of multicolored lights.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    2148.        Leonard S NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4337.       From England.      I found myself next to a railroad, it was dark but for a bright light and noise which became a Steam train going by me. It had as passengers some people who in life had been mean to me.  Quickly I ran through my entire life as a series of pictures and sounds.  I could take the train should I wish to; I was able to catch it but did not and started to walk into a tunnel to follow the train. At the end of the tunnel was a great light.  
   NDE from criminal attack.   

    2147.        Paula D Daughter NDE       2/25/2010.      Second-hand NDE 4335.             She says she 'flowed' through a brightly lit tube. When she saw her grandfather and another person she did not recognize, she felt a great deal of love and warmth and a sense of belonging. But her grandfather told her, that it wasn't her time. She felt confused. She told me that he very firmly said, 'Go Home.'  
   NDE due to pulmonary embolus, shared by her mother.   

    2146.        Jonathan G NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4333.             There were other people behind them.  I couldn't focus on them because of a bright light coming from something like a worm hole/cornucopia/horn of plenty shaped object behind them. There were figures of people rushing out of it toward me but I couldn't tell who they were due to the extreme brightness of the light coming from that object. I then became distracted by figures to my right which were all my former pets (dogs and cats that had died) climbing over each other to get to me, they gave me the impression of me just getting home from a long trip as they seemed very excited to see me.  
   NDE due to heart attack.  Met deceased parents and pets.   

    2145.        Richard R NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4332.             Then I realized that everyone was smiling, just a little Buddha-like smile and fear swept over me and I tensed and looked around for an attack from behind. Then I began to feel waves of love and peace flowing through everything. I felt I wanted to relax and flow with the Waves! Then the fear of the unknown seemed to fill me and I got scared!  
   NDE due to explosion on ship during Vietnam War. Interesting variant NDE content.   

    2144.        Paul O NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4331.       From Ireland.      I literally flew out of the top of my head. I found myself travelling in an upwards direction in total darkness but with a marvelously wonderful sense of wellbeing. I was cocooned in what I perceived to be a spherical form. My initial thought was, 'If this is being dead, I like it.' The joy of freedom from my body was as intense as it was immense. I perceived I was travelling at great speed but I had no references by which to measure how fast it was. I was being cared for, looked after, I felt very secure. I was travelling towards some place I was not aware of.  
   NDE due to car accident.   

    2143.        Jeff NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4330.       From Canada.      Through the seconds of my darkened vision, I saw what seemed like multiple bright lights surround my body's shape. The colors were very bright, yellowish-white color mixed with a neon blue.  
   NDE due to falling off hood of car at age sixteen.   

    2142.        Kenneth J NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4329.             In the meantime, I was watching them from up above, I heard all they said and saw all they did. I asked them later if that what I had seen and heard was accurate. Two emergency medical technicians were there. They told the others three or four times, 'He's dead.' I suddenly got a big breath of air and was back in my body.  
   NDE due to coal mining accident.   

    2141.        Jacqueline H NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4324.             I was eating breakfast with my then husband. We were talking and laughing, when a piece of biscuit was caught in my throat. I couldn't breathe. There was no pain, but I was scared not being to breathe. I remember gasping for air, and then everything went grey. I saw light grey everywhere. It was slowly getting darker, and darker, going from the grey to almost black. I heard a voice, or a muffled sound I thought was a voice that said, 'We are not ready. Not yet.' At that point, it started getting lighter and lighter, and woke up with my husband sitting in front of me with tears in his eyes. His mother was behind me pounding on my back. I gasped for a breath of air, and yelled at her to stop. I then said to my mother-in-law and husband, 'It doesn't hurt. Dying doesn't hurt.'  
   NDE due to choking.   

    2140.        Jerry G NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4323.             I floated up above, watched, and listened to the whole procedures until they revived me. I had gone into shock. Anyway, later I repeated my experience to my roommate verbatim and he was amazed as to my accuracy. There was no fear during my experience. It was the most calming time of my life.  
   NDE due to episode of unconsciousness after surgery.   

    2139.        Ken W NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4322.             I couldn't see myself and had no body part, like a hand, that I could hold up in front of my eyes (no eyes either) to confirm what I was, but I assumed that I was one of them. I was floating above the ground like them. I could move about effortlessly like them. All I had to do was think to move. As I buzzed about, they seemed to tell me to settle down because I was new and didn't know how to move about yet. They weren't using words, but I could clearly understand them just as if you would easily understand 'watch out' in a language you didn't speak. Thought, knowledge and memory were not linear, one thing after the other, but all at once. The amount of sensory intensity would have overwhelmed me minutes ago in my human body, but this was way cool. I could see and hear and conceive in ways that were inspiring and wonderful.  
   NDE due to inner tube accident at age fifteen.   

    2138.        Timothy N NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4321.       From Denmark.      The next thing I remember is that I am lying on the bottom of the water looking up into the mirror like surface of water above me. I'm not scared because now there are light stripes and beings (maybe angels?) beside me and I'm now looking at my body from above, there is also music - sounds like thousands of bright voices singing in harmony - I just want to be here forever! I will never ever forget this - this is so real  
   NDE at age four from drowning.   

    2137.        Tonya R NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4314.             The experience defined me and I, in turn, used it to guide my children. I do not limit this experience to my children but to everyone who I can feel will accept that there is unlimited joy to follow if we can allow ourselves to understand that this life is only the life we must get through to get to the joy of our true existence that waits for us on the other side. I also let them know that who we are and allow ourselves to be is the way to get there, to that beautiful un-limiting place.  
   NDE in the intensive care unit after surgery.   

    2136.        Deepak Y NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4313.       From India.      I felt darkness, no horn, no traffic sound nothing. Just I was feeling very light, there was no pain, nothing and vomiting going on and I was not having any feeling for that. My earlier life was coming to me in PowerPoint presentation type images. Then darkness, I was feeling free.  
   NDE due to intestinal bleed.   

    2135.        Rajnish K NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4312.       From India.      As I started rejoining both ends of the electric wire. I got an electric shock (I did not wear any gloves). It was like a knife-like particle inserted into my finger and it speedily entered my body towards my leg. I cried as loud as I could. My mom listened to me and started crying. I became unconscious laid down on the floor. Fortunately, the bare wire fell from my hand and I was saved. Between these almost ten to twenty seconds, I felt I was out of body, I felt that my body was lying down; if my mom removed the wire from my hand she could save my body. I really did not want to lose my body. I felt that I was telling to my mom to stop crying and remove the wire from my body's hand because I was unable to do so. I also felt that my mom was not listening to me but I did not know why.  
   NDE due to electrocution.   

    2134.        Lee K NDE       2/25/2010.      NDE 4310.             From high in the air I watched her holding my still body as she screamed for help, screaming that her baby was dying. I remember feeling sad that my mother was so upset, but at the same time, I felt very peaceful. I watched the scene from inside the apartment and could only see the back of her. Very quickly, I was laid on the sofa and several adults surrounded my body. I watched from high above as one neighbor initiated rescue breathing. I had felt nothing but peace until that point.  
   NDE at age three due to illness with febrile seizure and aspiration.   

    2133.        Tami C NDE       2/13/2012.      NDE 16023.             In March, 1984, I was six months pregnant, and awoke with severe pain in my leg.  In preparation of going to the emergency room, I began to feel faint. I felt like I was going to pass out.  I recovered within a few minutes, and my husband quickly drove to the emergency room.  While in the emergency room, I was lying down, and began to feel faint again.  The emergency room staff quickly wheeled me into an emergency room where they began to frantically ‘work’ on me.  During this time, I could hear them say, ‘We're losing her and the baby's heart rate is dropping.’  A nurse also apologized to me as she told me that I was going to feel tremendous pain while sticking a needle in my wrist to take blood and measure the oxygen level.  I felt nothing but pure peace and no pain. I felt like I was floating.   I remember thinking, ‘I just want to go to sleep.’  A voice quickly said, ‘No, it's not your time.’  The emergency room staff administered a dose of heparin since they determined that it was a blood clot.  Once this was administered, I awoke and felt excruciating pain.  Unbeknownst to me, a doctor took my husband aside, and told him that my daughter (yes, she was born a month later at three pounds, eleven ounces) and I were not expected to live.  A few days later, I had an X-ray that revealed two pulmonary emboli (blood clots on the lung), which they believe happened during my fainting episodes.  
   NDE from pregnancy complications.   

    2132.        Sergei Probable NDE       2/21/2010.      Probable NDE 4413.       From Canada. Original in French, translated to English by Kathy.      Suddenly I was propelled outside of my body and I could see the emergency doctors and another doctor come try to revive me. I could see around me. Everything was very bright and in sharp focus, no blurry vision. Then, looking at the scene I felt myself pulled into a vacuum that I couldn't see, everything was moving so fast. Then suddenly everything went black. For a moment I thought, hey, where is this, where am I? Then a great fright overtook me.  
   Probable NDE suicide at age twelve. Experience occurred in Russia.   

    2131.        Carol M NDE       2/12/2012.      NDE 16022.             I personally had weird complications after giving birth. I had lost a lot of blood. I was in the recovery room and holding the baby but felt like I was going to faint and told my sister to take the baby. I blacked out but could hear my sister calling for the nurse who came in and took my blood pressure. I heard her call out to the doctor, ‘don't leave yet.’ He answered, ‘what's her blood pressure?’ She said, ‘zip.’ There was a flurry of activity that I watched from above. I was floating at about the height of a filing cabinet or maybe a little higher. I was quite interested and expected to see them get out paddles or jab a needle into my heart. Instead, they jabbed a needle into the intravenous bag that was hooked up to my arm. In a few seconds, I was ‘back in my body,’ not overhead.  The next week during my first post-natal check-up, I asked my doctor why he jabbed the bag and not my heart. He explained why, but then said, ‘how did you know that?’ ‘Because I was watching from above.’ He said there was no way I could have known that since I had virtually no blood pressure. My heart, I believe, was still beating, but I don't know.  
   NDE from childbirth complications.   

    2130.        Lana C FDE       6/19/2010.      FDE 4438.             I had no vision whatsoever. I heard the flutter of wings, like the sound of a flock of birds taking off. I looked to my right to see what the noise was. I saw about thirty to forty angels descending from the sky. They descended so smoothly. They were all talking amongst themselves, so I couldn't understand what they were saying. It was like when a crowd of people is talking, and you can't make out what they are saying because too many people are talking at once. Their magnificence was like nothing I had ever witnessed.  
   Fear-death experience immediately prior to serious auto accident.   

    2129.        John Co NDE       1/29/2010.      NDE 16020.             I remember this as if it happened yesterday.  Dad had given me this liquid to clean scuff marks off the back of the car’s front seat. My parents were inside their apartment, entertaining old friends from out of town.  At one point, I got a little dizzy, so I stopped and sat up in the back seat and rolled the window down to breathe some fresh air. It was very cold outside. After a few minutes, I went back to work and that was the last thing I remember. They say when I passed out; my face fell right on a cleaning rag.  In my dream, I was at least forty inches above and at an angle to the rear of the car. I was lying face down on the driveway and Dad was straddled on me, giving artificial respiration. Our friends were standing by, but Mom was not there. I suppose she had gone to call the ambulance. Then I floated in space and went by three very bright moon-like uninhabited planets, each full of large craters.  All these years I have kept this a secret, feeling no one would believe me. This chemical was used, also, to clean typewriters and I never could stand the smell to this day. I do believe I have guardian angels that have helped me get this far. I believe my Mom and Dad are always around. Perhaps the angels back then were our friends, who were about to leave, but wanted to see the new car.   

    2128.        Ivette GM NDE       2/17/2010.      NDE 4407.       From Belgium. Original in French, translated by Jacqueline      I had the feeling of many colors, as if there were lots of colorful balloons everywhere, like if everything was color, and soft music, vivid, so beautiful, even though it was not really like the music we know here. I was separated from that huge procession, which was now in front of me and suddenly wider, at about ten meters. The first people at the front were my husband holding my children's shoulders, my daughter on his right, and my son on his left side. They had a huge smile; I felt that everybody was happy for me. When I could see them well, when I perceived their state of mind, their great joy, when they gave me their smiles and all that joy, the distance between everybody and I was shortened in an instant, and I was going to meet every one of them and they were coming to meet me, sliding.  
   NDE from respiratory arrest.   

    2127.        Juanita C NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 22195.             We hit a mountain head on and rolled three times. I floated up and saw two brick walls beside me. I was on asphalt.  To my back, it was really dark.  There was a tunnel in front of me and a dim light of fog.  Then my boyfriend called my name floated back down to my body.  
   Brief description of NDE due to car crash at age 17.   

    2126.        Desmond F NDE       2/4/2010.      NDE 4295.       From France. Original in French, translated by Jacqueline.      I am now fine. I am feeling intensely and immensely well, lying there.  I think so, for I am both spectator and actor of the stage. I am both inside and outside, so am I lying down? I don't know. I was bathing in a soft light around (or in front?) of me.  There were some familiar and extremely caring presences lean on me. I have no concept of time passing. I have the feeling that they tell me something although I hear nothing, I am sure there is a communication, though unable to mention any content or formal expression of it. As for what I feel - everything is serenity, benevolence, love - I bathe in the fullness, I dare say perfect happiness.  
   NDE from heart attack.   

    2125.        Jorge V NDE       2/4/2010.      NDE 4271.       From Mexico, Original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon A.      As soon as I was under anesthesia, I started seeing images of my life, right back to childhood. I saw my parents, my six brothers, my children and their mothers. I went back over many stages of my life, until I came to a stage when I began to see the things I had done wrong, but passing before me in a very rapid succession.  
   Surgery-related NDE.   

    2124.        Connie T NDE       2/4/2010.      NDE 4307.             I found myself in a field of brightly colored flowers, with the sensation of a river flowing just beyond the flowers. The whole area was enveloped in a very bright yellowish light. Just on the other side of the river was a huge crowd of beings with no discernable faces or other body characteristics. I had an overwhelming sense of welcome with the impression that they were beckoning to me to join them. Although I didn't actually see her, I was aware that one of them was my grandmother who had passed away about ten years before. I can recall vaguely wondering if my father was in the crowd (he died when I was eleven). I didn't actually speak to anyone, nor did I hear any words spoken to me. It was more just a very brightly colored vision, with sensations of joy and welcome.  
   NDE due to faint following surgery.   

    2123.        George W Possible NDE       2/4/2010.      Possible NDE 4308.             Once I was out for the count I started seeing strange beings and my life on another planet with all my friends and family. They told me that we live forever but we had to go through death after every life. I was told our death provides light and energy to the universe and after we provided the light and energy for a bit we come back. I saw so many things and it was like they all happened at once. In the beginning I was very afraid, bad things kept happening, but as I progressed through the experience it became more and more peaceful.  
   Possible NDE due to seizure and pneumonia.   

    2122.        Janice H NDE       2/4/2010.      NDE 4306.             As I was being crushed by the car, I felt myself being squeezed so hard that my breath was leaving me and I thought to myself, 'Oh God, I am going to die.' About this time, I was being levitated to the sky. I looked down where my body was lying and my right leg was all twisted. I saw the two people that were traveling with me crying and were very upset over my injuries. The ambulance had arrived and the attendant was administering help to me. I watched them do what they could but I could not understand why everyone was so upset. I was feeling wonderful and happy. I knew that this was a wonderful thing that was happening to me.  
   NDE due to auto accident. Shared fifty-eight years later.   

    2121.        Al G NDE       2/4/2010.      NDE 4305.       From Croatia.      Strangely, I did not feel any danger, even though I could hear thunder and see big waves hit the ship. The only thing I could feel was peace and satisfaction, pleasantness. I was happy, first moment of happiness after a couple of years. I felt divine. I felt like I'm the nature itself. It felt like I'm floating in air for hours and hours, and then suddenly I heard a voice of the woman I love (even though she left me two months before that, I still love her) telling me to be strong, to make it through. That voice told me to get up, open my eyes and to live; because it is not my time yet to leave this life.  
   NDE due to head injury. Heard former lover tell him that it was not his time.   

    2120.        Gary T NDE       2/1/2010.      NDE 4304.             I then remember looking down on my body and my brother standing over me crying and pulling my hair to get back up the stairs. I saw my mother run down and pick me up crying and blowing air in my mouth, I remember thinking why is she doing that I'm okay. Then the next thing I was in my body looking up at my mom and then I was unconscious in a coma for two weeks.  
   NDE due to fall with head injury at age four. Gary is now a Registered Nurse.   

    2119.        Joe A NDE       2/4/2010.      NDE 4303.             I remember seeing myself from above as I lay there. I saw myself lying there and the other boys gathered around me. It seems like it only lasted a few seconds. I remember having a strange feeling of seeing myself lying there. When I came to, all the boys that were running with me and the boys practicing on the other baseball field were standing around me. The coach had them carry me to the gymnasium where the high school principle met us.  
   NDE due to head injury.   

    2118.        Sandy M Probable NDE       2/4/2010.      Probable NDE 4300.             They said they were going to rush me into surgery as soon as the doctor arrived whom they had already called. They told me they would have to perform a dilation and curettage procedure and they would put me out. In the Recovery Room I was speaking to a being that I had the understanding was the Lord Jesus Christ but he didn't say he was but I just 'knew' who he was because of the comfort and peace, I was in. I was conversing with the 'Lord' and I said what I thought was out loud, 'Thank you for being with me during this,' and I just had such a warm and cozy feeling, really calm and at peace.  
   Probable NDE following miscarriage.   

    2117.        Bonnie VB NDE       2/10/2010.      NDE 4299.             Then I looked up and I thought the little light up above came on (the refrigerator was not plugged in so there actually was no light). It was very tiny and then I felt myself leaving my body, going up through the grates, and into the light. I was being pulled up through a tunnel that opened into the most beautiful white light that I could ever describe. When I was fully into the light, I realized it was the most incredibly beautiful light that I had ever seen. It seemed to have a personality that was beyond belief loving. I was happy just being in the light. I remember then that I heard a voice that I thought was the light that surrounded me. Without having a body, somehow, I talked to the voice. I was shown that the white light was really made up of all the colors. I was shown the zillions of colors in the light, more than I have seen on earth. They were all beautiful.  
   NDE from asphyxiation at age four. Shared by retired college professor sixty-three years later.   

    2116.        Nostra J NDE       2/4/2010.      NDE 4297.             I felt exhausted and deeply relieved to sit down.  Then it seemed I was in some other place.  There was a lot of wind there and the wind made a lot of noise. I saw that I was in a tunnel.  I seemed to be floating through the air, propelled by the wind. I was very calm.  There was no sense of worry or fear.  I was willing to go where this wind would take meà Experience was definitely real.  It has been 19 years since this experience.  Plus I know I have a poor memory that has plagued me since a child.  But I have never forgotten anything that happened to me that day.  
   NDE due to apparent faint.   

    2115.        Patricia M Probable NDE       2/4/2010.      Probable NDE 4293.             The water seemed white and all else was this grey sort of color, but transparent too. My father was standing on a hill by a big building with lots of windows, but I couldn't see in the windows because they were blacked out. My mother and father looked the same, but different too. I need to say that my mother and father have been dead for a number of years. This place was so peaceful and wonderfully beautiful that I never wanted to leave. I was so happy.  
   Probable NDE in ICU after emergency surgery for colon rupture.   

    2114.        Kathleen B Death Bed Vision       2/2/2010.      Shared Death Experience 4290.             When he arrived next to us, I realized that this was Jesus and he was talking to my grandfather and I was answering him for my grandfather. I felt my grandfather's fear leave him and Jesus outstretched his hands to take my grandfather's hand in his. At the very moment God/Jesus took my grandfather's hand, I felt God touch my hand and I suddenly felt/knew this tremendous sense of peace and forgiveness and universality. I felt how all things were connected.  
   Exceptional experience of transitioning with her dying grandfather into the afterlife. These types of experiences, along with shared NDEs, are among the strongest evidence that what happens in NDEs is what happens at the time of permanent, irreversible de   

    2113.        Elizabeth S NDE       2/2/2010.      NDE 4289.             Then as I gazed at the sun, it kept coming closer to the window, getting larger, speeding up, and getting brighter. My thought was that the earth and the sun were about to collide and I was witnessing the end of the world. The ball of light came through the window with the sound of a swift wind, and I saw an awesome image of illuminating white light who was Jesus.  
   NDE due to complications of delivery.   

    2112.        Jennifer B NDE       2/2/2010.      NDE 4287.             I was completely relaxed and pain free. I felt filled with love and peace, as if I was exactly where I was supposed to be. I also noticed that my thoughts were extremely clear, very unlike my usual self. I wasn't floating long before I noticed a field of stars below me. They formed a sort of curtain that divided where I was from somewhere else. I knew I would be able to go to them if I just thought about doing it, but right after I had that thought, a male voice spoke to me in my head. He told me that if I went past the stars I wouldn't be able to come back. I remember thinking, 'I'm not sure I want to go back, it's so wonderful here.' And that was it.  
   NDE due to hypotension, fainting, and blow to head.   

    2111.        Bobbie K NDE       2/2/2010 & 12/22/2016.      NDE 4285/8166.       From Canada, originally from Hungary.      Eyes wide open, guided by the Light, So familiar, so loved, so free. Far from illusion, heading toward the sea. I reach a tunnel, the water is gone, my body no longer in sight. My spirit soars lightning speed ahead. Much to my delight, I am on other side of life!  
   NDE at age four or five from drowning.  Much of it shared as two beautiful poems.   

      2110.        David A NDE       2/2/2010.      NDE 4284.             I was on a hospital table after losing almost all of my blood. Doctors were working on me. I floated out of my body. I glanced back. The doctors had stopped working and were walking away. A nurse was filling out a report. I entered into a tunnel of swirling lights of many colors. Two beings met me, apparently as guides. As we started to continue the journey, the two beings (angels?) stopped and told me that it was not yet my time. They released me and I suddenly re-entered my body. I looked at the nurse and told her that I was thirsty. She jumped back in shock and dropped her clipboard, and then began calling for doctors. The doctors hooked up various bottles through IV tubes, and I went to sleep. I woke up the next day in a hospital ward.  
   NDE associated with combat in Vietnam.   

    2109.        Ray S NDE       2/2/2010.      NDE 4282.             [I] watched as my mother came to the porch and yelled for father my brother and sister crying. As for me? Just calm it was just after Christmas and I got the sheep skin coat that I bugged my parents for - I only bring this up because my brother bought me a purple slush while he was in the store earlier and I could see my dad trying to revive me and the slush staining my coat! So here I am dead and I am upset over a coat! Don't know how long this was all taking; I just know I was slowly rising higher floating in the tree looking down.  
   NDE due to carbon monoxide poisoning at age seven. OBE observations later confirmed.   

    2108.        Dea M NDE       2/2/2010.      NDE 4281.             The colors got more intense and more detailed, turning into patterns and textures and weaving of both color and sound. While I knew that this was not of our world, it all seemed natural and without need for explanation. At some point, I understood the essence of creativity and was given the 'joy stick' of my own imagination so to speak, to create my own visions. It was amazing; whatever I thought became vision, and swirled around me in its own reality. I realized my unlimited potential as a human, I realized the unlimited ability to feel love, and I knew that I was being held in that 'love' and I knew that this was the forever-ness of that love. I knew what it was like to LOVE the way that God loves, and when that happened my 'heart' opened and I could feel my soul touching that of the unseen creator, I knew that 'God' does exist and we are a part of it all.  
   Exceptional NDE due to car accident. Perhaps the most dramatic description of colors ever.   

    2107.        Debbie P NDE       2/2/2010.      NDE 4280.             My experience was marked by the distinct sound of universal joyous laughter that reverberated everywhere about me - surrounding me - flowing through me, an outpouring of such wondrous bliss and happiness, and I was overcome with an overwhelming sense of Great Love - the answer to my lifelong question, always, 'What is our reason for living and existing in the first place?' The Answer from this Cosmic Source was 'To love unconditionally - to experience it, to express it, to share it!'  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest while under general anesthesia.   

    2106.        Sue H NDE       2/2/2010.      NDE 4279.             I thought that I would never have the experience of being near an angel again, when one day swimming in the river I got on a beaver barge, I panicked and couldn't pull myself out of the water, I was submerged with just inches from the surface, no air, starting to fade out,  when I looked up through the water and saw a person standing upon the barge where no one could be supported she put her hand through the water, over my face, pushed me HARD under the barge and through the other side, I jumped up to see if anyone was on the barge, and no one....I do believe in guardian angels.  
   NDE due to burn injuries at age 6 and life-saving encounter with an angel.  NDE happened 52 years ago.   

    2105.        Sylvia D NDE       2/2/2010.      NDE 4278.             àthis was an extreme threat to my life, I was not expected to live. As soon as the aneurysm ruptured, I knew something was terribly wrong. The pain was so severe, and my condition worsened very rapidly. I was at first aware of the seriousness of my condition until I lost consciousness. Then, I was in this very intense, bright light. I am uncertain of the timeline and order of events, but at some point, I was with my deceased grandmother. She was in a field picking green beans, and I was with her. The light almost felt like a very hot summer day, but I felt drawn into this light, a part of the light. There was no pain, no fear, only a feeling of warmth, peace, love, and serenity. It was so wonderful that I wanted to remain in that light. Then, I was aware of others with me, but only recognized my recently deceased mother. She was in a gown of white, I could see her and I reached to touch her but she remained out of my reach. I was told I could not stay, that it was not my timeà  
   NDE due to ruptured brain aneurysm.   

    2104.        Beth B NDE       2/2/2010.      NDE 4277.             The entire experience felt like I was in a higher level of awareness than I had ever been.  This event is crystal clear in my memory and has always beenà Experience was definitely real           When my Grandmother visited and I told her about the man I thought was my grandfather, she listened and then pulled out this picture of him (he was 65 when he died). It was the same man I had visited, but much younger.  He didn't say this to me, but I said something to my Grandmother that convinced her that I had seen him -- it was strange, but I remembered to tell her that the key was behind the stove.  She had lost her clock key, and that's where she found it.  
   NDE due to drowning at age 7 ╜.  Shared 53 ╜ years later.   

    2103.        Grady R NDE       2/2/2010.      NDE 4276.             Just before I hit the van I saw everything in my life, from major to something as small as putting my shoes on.  I saw every little detail, big or small, within a millisecond.  At the time, Cadillac Wagons were used for ambulances.  At no time was I able to see the roof, but it had the number 69 in red on the roof.  
   NDE due to motorcycle accident.   

    2102.        KB NDE       2/2/2010.      NDE 4275.             The river bottom changes constantly so in playing on what had previously been a sandbar; I step off and was over my head in the water. I struggled to gain my footing but began to sink in the water. Eventually I stopped struggling and a feeling of calm came over me. I saw my life (as brief as it was) flash before me. I experienced feeling very peaceful and happy to go toward the bright light ahead. The next thing I recall was someone grabbing me. My sister says she looked over and saw my hair floating on top of the water (my hair was waist length at the time). She rushed over and pulled me out by my hair.  
   NDE at age 8 due to near drowning.   

    2101.        Frank P NDE       2/2/2010.      NDE 4272.             I suddenly fell back and was fully surrounded by an energy of a white light. I have NEVER seen this color white here on earth. It did not hurt my eyes to see it. I felt relaxed with no thoughts of my family or my past. I somehow knew I was in the place I have seen others talk about. I do not know how I knew this. I then had a male voice say to me 'Frank, do you want to go with me or go back?' Without hesitation I said, 'go back'. As soon as I said back, I felt the shock of the paddles come in on my right chest and cross to the left.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    2100.        Bobby H NDE       2/1/2010.      NDE 4270.             The light embraced me, as if it consumed me. It was then I realized that I no longer had the stress of a body - my lungs no longer had to work my intercostal muscles to breath and my heart no longer had to work to pump life sustaining blood to my organs.  I was free of the body and the daily stress of a physical existence.  I no longer felt fear or loneliness, or emotional pain.  There are no human words available to describe this.  It was a total immersion in God's love, in his light, as if in the presence of Christ himself, immersed in the Holy Spirit.  I could see, but not with my eyes, hear but not with my ears, and so on.  It was the most beautiful thing that I have ever experienced in my life, before or since. It was not physical.  It was 100% spiritual.  
   NDE due to falling accident.  Also shares remarkable ADC that happened at the time of his son's death.   

    2099.        William M NDE       2/1/2010.      Shared NDE 4269.             I went to sleep while driving. Then I was aware that we were out of our bodies & quickly flying up toward space, holding hands. We flew straight up for a minute or so when we started to see a park or countryside-like landscape. It seemed to be in twilight, dark, but we could see trees, bushes, etc. Suddenly, four creatures intercepted us. They seemed about ten feet in height & were invisible, but we could see a vague humanoid outline (my best description would be like the invisibility effect in the movie "predator" which I saw some years later. Two flanked each of us and began to gently separate us. They overwhelmed us with a feeling of the highest love & compassion that was well beyond anything we could experience on earth.  
   Rare 'shared NDE' account.  Auto accident with his girlfriend.  The two of them shared part of the experience.  He was sent back, she was not.   

    2098.        Silvia B Possible NDE       1/30/2010.      Possible NDE 4301.       From Argentina. Original in Spanish translated to English by David.      In that moment, my whole life with every single scene that it was composed of passed by very quickly. I couldn't remain in any scene for more than a fraction of a second. My attention was directed towards a very white and brilliant light. I wanted to go toward that place. I felt attracted to it - I felt a strong attraction to the peace and light. It was an experience that the years haven't allowed me to forget. It was extraordinary.  
   Possible NDE during childbirth.   

    2097.        Dorie E Mom NDE       1/25/2007.      Secondhand NDE 16009.             My mother said she remembered the beautiful light and the ‘men’ waiting for her. She was asked whether she wanted to stay or go back. She said she had six children and, of course, with me on the way, she thought she should finish her job on earth and go back. My father couldn’t have handled it all on his own. My father over the years, being an Irish immigrant with a big ego, always talked about that time when the doctors told him she was going to die and he ‘cried like a baby.’ My relatives have told me that my mom was very ill when carrying me. Apparently, she had a bad case of pneumonia.    

    2096.        Amy D ADC       7/17/2007.      ADC 16016.             Next thing I know, I am standing outside the nursing home where Josie lived. The most beautiful golden light was shining above. I was in amazement as I looked at the trees and the light emitting from every leaf. It was autumn. The colors had a vibrancy and brilliance never seen on earth. Next, I heard my grandmother's voice. ‘This place is not-ting but corridors!’  My heart again felt so heavy and I told her I understand and I am so sorry!  I did not see her physically, but felt her next to me. She then told me she was’ leaving’ and wanted to tell me how much she loved me.  Instantly, I felt what she meant and understood the Light.  I stood in awe. Everything conveyed was telepathic and was felt in emotion more than the words. The love exuded was felt full bodied and it was all-consuming.  
   Shared Death Experience (NELE/ADC)   

    2095.        Jack A NDE       11/10/2007.      NDE 16003.             I spent one hundred and fifty five active and healthful years creating art and architecture on ‘the other side.’  The paradise I found myself in was intimately familiar. I also immediately recognized my deceased grandmother, although she had transitioned from life as we know it, some thirteen years before I was born.  
   Amazing NDE art as a result of his experience on the other side!   

    2094.        Marta Y NDE       1/26/2010.      NDE 4251.       From Mexico. Original in Spanish translated to English by Simon.      After this I saw myself floating in the void, and little by little tiny spheres of many colors became manifest, not moving at first, then suddenly starting to vibrate while smoothly approaching me and incorporating themselves with my essence, which made me feel something I can't manage to describe, it was as if I was being tickled. I asked what this was, and a voice said, 'This is the knowledge you have accumulated in previous lives, it was kept from you, but now it will be of use to you.'  
   Very detailed NDE where she met her second son who had not been born yet!   

    2093.        Ludmila NDE       1/23/2010.      NDE 4168.       From the Ukraine. Original in Ukrainian, translated to English by Yulia.      But they did not interested me at all, because I knew everything and I did not have a necessity to use all that information. I was overflowing with the feeling of pleasure, and the feeling that at last I was coming back to the place that was so dear to me. My movement was guided by my interest. There were no words in my consciousness. In my mind, I used only concept, logic and intuition. I moved permanently upwards, my consciousness revealed more and more, and I can describe a condition of my consciousness as an allegorical symbol of a flower of a lotus, which opens its thousand petals.  
   NDE from anemia and a cure after she came back!   

    2092.        Alejandra M NDE       1/23/2010.      NDE 4244.       From Argentina.  Original in Spanish, translated to English by Jacqueline.      Suddenly I was standing in front of a black swirl and moving ahead to cross it - to reach out to a bright light that was getting larger as I moved towards it. I quickly entered that light and saw bright, faceless people with human form, who I did not know but felt they knew me because of the friendly way in which they received me. I had the feeling that one of them was my late uncle that I loved so much. These entities received me with great joy and greeted me by my name, but all this dialogue was by telepathy.  I was not talking, and they did not have voices either. I also remember feeling a sensation of peace, welfare and happiness beyond description. It was as if I belonged to that place.  
   NDE from fainting prior to blood draw. Was aware she needed to return, but did not want to.   

    2091.        Gail C NDE       1/23/2010.      NDE 4268.       From Mexico      I just saw a light like the sun, so bright and clear. I saw this as if I was lying down looking at the sky, but it was not the sun for sure. How could I be looking at the sun without hurting my eyes? I heard children laughing, as if they were playing and having fun. But that peace, that peace was awesome.  
   NDE due to car accident.  From Mexico.   

    2090.        Judy G NDE       1/23/2010.      NDE 4267.             The doctors now tell me that my skin was grey, my heart rate was 20, and my blood sugar was too high to read.  They needed to put an IV in my neck with a temporary pacemaker or I would die.  I told them do whatever they needed to do.  That's when every got really far off in a distance.  I could hear voices, but they were so far away.  There wasn't just one light.  There was a black tunnel-shaped hole with hundreds of white lights literally flying from the tunnel and coming at me, trying to pull me in.  The pull was extremely strong.  I started going toward the lights.  Then something went off in my brain and I mentally blinked my eyes to see if the lights and tunnel would go away.  They didn't go, the pull got stronger.  I was terrified.  I yelled 'NOàI'm not ready...Go away'.  
   NDE from viral illness and severe hyperglycemia.   

    2089.        Carole C NDE       1/23/2010.      NDE 4266.             In the meantime, I saw my body lying there on the bed, from the corner ceiling of my bedroom behind my bedroom door. I remember my friends dragging me off the bed, trying to get me to walk. There were two others with me in the ceiling (so to speak). We were discussing my life. I can remember bickering with them. I did not want to go back to my life. I suppose they were displaying to me all the reasons why I should.  
   NDE due to suicide attempt.   

    2088.        Bill C NDE-Like       1/23/2010.      NDE-Like 4263.             I was not yet sleeping but had my eyes closed. I saw a bright flash. I next remember a dark tunnel and two figures on both sides of me guiding me towards a very bright light. I remember instantly of reading or hearing of people talking about this type of experience when I was younger. I instinctively look to my right to see if I was in a dark tunnel. It was surprised to see stars, but made a point to note this for some reason. There was no fear at all in me. I just glided along with the two figures, one holding each arm. The light was getting brighter ahead of me. Finally, we were near what look like a four tier Golden Arch. Beyond this Arch I can see all my relatives who passed away, especially my Mother. All looked very happy and were all smiles. We could communicate but not by talking.  
   NDE-like experience at time of going to bed not associated with a life-threatening event.   

    2087.        Carol L NDE       1/23/2010.      NDE 4262.             When I had left the planet, I was an entity, sitting on the bottom of a thick black line (as if sitting on the floor in a hallway leaning against the wall) which had beautiful bright white light running the length of either side. I did not have a body and had no awareness of being 'Carol' or having a husband and children, a home and a job. I was waiting and was aware of that. I was patient and not bored at all. Not like me. I get antsy and bored, especially without visual stimuli. I was aware of my essence. That I remember as being very much me. I was just kind of hanging out waiting for a decision. I had no worries or cares and I was so FREE, RELAXED, and CONTENT.  
   NDE due to complication after surgery.   

    2086.        J.H. NDE       1/23/2010.      NDE 4261.       From the United Kingdom      I was aware that there was no linearity to my experience, no attachment almost as though the forces that operated inside it were free floating. In our framework for understanding it, I could say this intense softness wanted me and loved me, as if it was pulling itself to itself with joy, smiling peace, and the most intense softness. Then there appeared in the bottom left corner of my mind's eye a luminescence.  
   NDE due to bleeding after delivery.   

    2085.        S.L. NDE       1/23/2010.      NDE 4259.             Every time I (we) went on a journey, my guardian would say you must go back to your body. I would say, 'No it is too nice here.' This happened several times. Then on our last trip away from my room, my guardian said 'It is not your time. We have other things for you to do. We will come and get you at the right time.' I found myself back in the room with my guardian in a corner. I said I don't want to go back it is too peaceful here. The guardian said in a calm voice, 'It is not your time we, will come when it is your time.'  
   NDE due to unspecified accident at age eight. Shared forty-eight years later.   

    2084.        Miguel RP NDE       1/14/2010.      NDE 4133.       From Columbia. Original in Spanish translated to English by Simon.      I returned to the black tunnel, I don't know for how long, as everything seemed to happen instantaneously. I came again to the light, but this time it was brighter and stronger than the previous times. I got used to the light and saw a clear sky, without sun or clouds, neither hot nor cold. I looked at my chest and could see no damage, and I began to praise God, I was well and I was saying, 'Thanks to Christ for saving me, nothing happened to me.' I was feeling myself and could not believe what I was seeing. I looked up and there was no one there. The floor was brilliant like crystal, and then I saw a person dressed in something like a white nightgown, who came near me but without my being able to see his face and hands, which were shining light. When he was near me, I told him I was working with explosives and they had blown-up on me, but without harming me. He told me to calm myself. I asked him who he was and he replied that he was the Angel Gabriel  
   Apocalyptic NDE with Angel Gabriel.   

    2083.        Eric SV NDE       1/14/2010.      NDE 4255.       From France      At first, I saw everything turning around me and suddenly, everything disappeared! I was in total darkness; everything went black. There was nothing else, but I was not scared.  I felt good, quiet and I was moving fast and straight. I knew where I was headed to and it felt like I was going back home. My only wish was to get there fast! I moved straight into the darkness. Then, I heard someone calling me from behind.  I stopped to hear the voice better because it seemed so far away.  I hesitated, wondering whether to keep on my way ‘out there’, or go to the voice that kept on calling me, again and again.  
   Beginnings of an OBE from a fainting experience.   

    2082.        Louise S NDE       1/14/2010.      NDE 4254.       From Scotland.      I felt very light and floated in the air. The pain had suddenly stopped, the stress that I had been feeling ceased and I felt very relaxed and at ease with the world. I had no worries any more. I felt at peace but aware of my surroundings at the same time. I knew that I was out of my body and I was floating just above it, near the ceiling of the room, I was aware of the doctors and nurses panicking over my lifeless body. I 'looked down' and could 'see' my still body, it looked a very blue color.     I felt so comfortable and serene, floating above my body, no worries, no pain, I felt wonderful. I remember thinking, ‘Wow, this is GREAT!’, ‘What a feeling!’.  
   NDE due to blood loss following miscarriage.   

    2081.        Debbie NDE       1/14/2010.      NDE 4253.             I wasn't afraid at the scene but instead felt an overwhelming feeling of peace and some curiosity. I felt something and looked up beyond the rope. That's when I saw a fuzzy white circle of white light in the distance. It wasn't the sun because I remember seeing that as well. I ‘thought’ at the light ‘Oh no not yet please! I like this one and I’m not ready yet’. At the same time, I felt as though I knew everything I had ever wanted to know, and more, even at that very young age. I knew that whatever happened to me in this life it would all be fine. It was all just life experiences, good and bad. The feeling of complete unconditional love was so very strong I almost didn't want to leave it, but I knew I would be with it again; I belonged with it.  
   NDE due to drowning at age 5.   

    2080.        Amber Y FDE       1/14/2010.      FDE 4256.             For the brief seconds before it occurred yes it seemed like everything was in slow motion then I felt like if I was going to die it would be fine... [The] Experience was definitely real, I thought about it and I have never felt so loved in my life.  
   Fear-death experience seconds before car crash. Experience happened about seven weeks ago.   

    2079.        Sylvia R NDE       1/2/2010.      NDE 4248.             I was out of my body, observing my body lying on the hospital bed and I could hear everything that my two sisters and the nurse were saying. I tried to talk to my sisters to let them know that I was all right but they did not hear me.  Immediately after this, my spirit went through a darkened tunnel, extremely fast and looking upwards, I could see a white light at the end. My spirit went through this tunnel with a ‘Whoosh’ and there I was, standing in the brightest white light I had ever known. The midday sun could not compare with its brightness or stark whiteness.  
   NDE during unconsciousness after surgery.   

    2078.        Mark B Probable NDE       1/2/2010.      Probable NDE 4249.             When I reached my last and final shelter, I felt as though I could go no deeper as I locked the door behind me and waited within the security of my refuge. Somehow, I ‘knew’ that I would remain there and had reached the end of my journey. This last refuge became a fortress different from those before it. It seemed more calm and tranquil there than that of my previous shelters. The pain, which I had desperately sought to elude, was never able to penetrate the walls of this refuge, as it had been able to before. I left all contacts with my physical body far behind and above me where they would remain. leaving only my inner ‘self’, the core of my ‘being’, then separated from the external world far above and outside the new world of my ‘self’ to pass through the walls of this fortress.  
   ICU Experience and Probable NDE.  Lengthy description of severe injury, and epic struggle for recovery.   

    2077.        James S NDE       1/2/2010.      NDE 4247.       From the UK.      Just as I took her weight, everything switched off and I was in total darkness. Then my life memories including ones I knew nothing about flashed through my brain, then it all faded slowly away into total darkness again. The next thing I knew I was standing on what seemed like terracotta sand. Even though all around me was total darkness, I knew I was in a large circular cavern or hall of sorts that had arched doorways, again in darkness, and above me was water with gentle ripples flowing across it. The water was about twenty feet above me and through it; I could see what I took at the time to be a bright moon that was acting as a type of spotlight upon me. I had no pain or discomfort of any kind and my thinking and senses were normal. I felt warm, very comfortable, and very emotional with an overwhelming feeling of love and happiness.  
   NDE due to heart attack.   

    2076.        Dan B NDE       1/2/2010.      NDE 4245.             I began reliving my life. Whilst I was seeing it from my perspective, I was also experiencing my every action as everyone affected by my actions. I could literally feel the concentric circles of 'emotion' going out from me, as they were experienced by each person in turn: I affect John, John affects Ray, Ray affects Sam, etc., and I experienced all of it. I was still frightened and sad about my life.  
   NDE due to episode of unconsciousness and stated heart attack.   

    2075.        Victoria NDE       1/2/2010.      NDE 4242.             I fell into the bath tub which was full to the top with water. As I had hit my head twice, my reflexes were impaired. I swallowed water. I remember could not get out because it was so slippery, my head was hurting immensely and blood was coming out of my nose.  Then in one moment, I just laid there with my eyes open, at peace. I saw myself completely submerged in the water, lifeless.  I watched myself from outside of my body and there was nothing I could do.  When I was in the hospital, I heard people pounding on my chest, saying how young I was. What a time to die, just before the holidays.  
   NDE due to drowning that occurred less than four days prior to sharing the experience.   

    2074.        Laurie C NDE       1/2/2010.      NDE 4241.       From Australia      I thought to myself, I'm dead.  So, this is death.  I wasn't at all frightened, and when I thought about how I should be frightened, a wave of pure love washed through my being.  I felt totally at peace and very safe, and love was in me and around me everywhere.  I was calm and had no thought of the accident.  No pain, just absolute peace.  I remember thinking that I could still think and noticed how alert I was.  Then a voice said to me, ‘do you want to stay or do you want to go back?’  
   NDE due to car accident.   

    2073.        Stephen P NDE       1/2/2010.      NDE 4240.             After lying down for a bit. I started to feel really strange - my body felt like it was sort of preparing for something. My limbs started to stretch and settled back in a certain position, my whole body followed suit. Then I felt myself just drift away and leave my body. I remember that it was a most pleasant feeling. I then felt enveloped in a warm loving peaceful light. At this time I was told that it was not time for me yet, and I felt like I was kind of 'slammed' back into my physical body.  
   NDE due to a seizure.   

    2072.        Robert C NDE       1/2/2010.      NDE 4239.             I tried to assure them I was going into the light but they denied my passage.  They were adamant it was not my time. Then I noticed I was a ball of light. I no longer had the shape of a human being. My consciousness was spherical in all directions at once and I had a god like knowing. Then all at once, I saw my entire life pass before me in minute detail. In fact, I saw much more than words and deeds but how they effected those around me. It was like energy radiating from me that rippled out like a pebble tossed into still water eventually touching everything around it. I saw how my actions hurt others even indirectly. I was devastated.  
   Remarkably deep NDE at age 6 due to drowning.   

    2071.        Marian F Probable NDE       1/2/2010.      Probable NDE 4238.             I noticed a very dark corner on the upper left-hand side of my 'view'. In the center of it was a vivid white light, really not more than a pupil-sized light. It was so brilliant and whiter than any white I'd ever noticed. I knew what it was so I didn't want to look.  But I did look because it was beautiful and pure white and lovely.  
   Probable NDE due to nitrous oxide administration for dental procedure.   

    2070.        Harold B NDE       1/2/2010.      NDE 4237.             The doctor came in and said to my brother, 'He's gone.' I rose out of my body; saw the doctor, my brother, and a friend. Everything in the room was very vivid. I seemed to float into a blinding light and a hand reached out and took my hand. I felt, I guess a rapture-like feeling of peace and serenity. I saw a man in shadows who said, 'You can go back if you want or you can continue this journey.' I wanted to come back. He let go of my hand. I floated back into my body, opened my eyes, stood up, I felt great, and to the disbelief of everyone walked to the ocean with a feeling of pure joy.  
   NDE due to malaria and other illness. Happened in India, though he is not a native of India.   

    2069.        Laura J NDE       1/2/2010.      NDE 4236.             I remember falling asleep, and then I looked down and saw myself on the surgery bed, the doctors and nurse frantically doing something to me. I thought that was very strange and was very curious. I remember seeing me as being very small in a white gown and they were doing something to my mouth. I did not know what they were doing. I was distracted by something over my right shoulder, it was warm, and I wanted to go there. It was like sunshine (I really remember the warmth, but a comfortable warmth-like comforting warmth).  
   NDE due to anesthesia complication at age six.   

    2068.        Sandra B NDE       1/2/2010.      NDE 4235.             The doctor was yelling for me to answer him. I could not even move a finger. I did not know that my heart was gone. I struggled to answer him but I could not nor could I move any part of my body to signal I heard him. After a short time, I left my body and I was looking down at my body. I would say I was about six feet up over my body. I thought to myself, 'I must be dead as I am looking at my dead body down there.' I was very calm and began to move very slowly upwards and it was more and more beautiful into an infinity of light and peace, happiness, I knew I was going to heaven or somewhere very beautiful. I did not want to come back at this point as it was the most happy I had ever been in my life. I felt so loved.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    2067.        Roxana M Probable NDE       12/6/2009.      Probable NDE 22182.       From France      I remember I got out of the bathroom feeling sick and unable to see. When I have arrived into the room, crushed by all the walls surrounding me, I fell down. Slowly, like a feather, and I put my hands down to prevent the fall. Then I just remember that I saw myself from somewhere up above. Then I went, I went with an enormous speed heading to a white shining light on a channel. I remember I could see where I was going. I could see the end of that tunnel, brightly sparkling. When I got there it was extremely white and I remember seeing somebody but I do not know who it was, an old person, I'm sure of that. And we had a long chat. After that I remember coming back with even greater speed than before, and I could see myself down below waiting for me.  
   Probable NDE due to apparent unconsciousness of unknown cause.
