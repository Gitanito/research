I had mine when young, maybe 8 yrs old.  I don't remember all to well but, Dad was teaching me to swim, in the pond on the farm,  something happened and I went under,  I left my body, and was above it, and back some, and could see myself wondering why, I guess.  Everything was green,  except there was a big white light over my right shoulder, behind me some.  When I was removed from my body,  there was a feeling of great rest, or indescribable feeling,  peaceful beyond words.  Then all of a sudden I felt like I was pulled threw a pipe, back to my body and out of the water.   Dad said I had came up for the third time when he was (just) lucky enough to grab me.  Dad was very upset,  and took me to get swimming lessons from then on.  I will add a personnel note to you.  I think this experience helped me get through Viet Nam,  because I had no fear of getting killed, except one, leaving my family behind.  I did about buy the farm a number of times.  Lost 13 buddies one night within 100 feet of me.  Life is really great however and I want to live to be 100 plus,  just to see the families grow.
