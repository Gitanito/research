  		              		Experience Description   

    I was at the hospital having a sodium blocker test  to see what was wrong with my heart. I was awake when I died. I told the doctor that it felt like I was going down a railroad track in a car. In reality, I was beginning to go into cardiac arrest. 

  Within seconds, my life flashed before my eyes.  I  did not like what I saw. In a flash, I was soaring above the great Smoky Mountain National Park. In another flash, I found myself in the middle of a warm, golden field. I heard murmurs and voices. I felt so warm and so loved. The only thing that existed in the world was love.  We were all connected into it one giant energy ball of pure love-source. The Beings, who were with me, told me that it was not my time and I’d have to go back.  I looked at them like they were insane. I thought, 'Go back? What were they talking about? Who would ever want to leave the space of love?' 
  
  As I look around, I saw a vast light all around me. I saw a grid of connection That was like I had a string running through my whole body. The string was coming out the top of my head and  was connected to everything and everyone else. 

  In another flash, I was lying on a cold table in a room with humans dressed in white, who were looking at me.  I could not hear and  did not know who I was. I  looked around the room and was thinking to myself that this was a messed up dream. I needed to wake up and  get back to where I was. Then I saw a monitor with my name on it. Then everything came back. I remembered who I was and what why I was here.  I knew I had been sent back because  my children needed me. 

  After this experience, I did not sleep for two days. I wrote down everything. I wrote why I was here and what kind of person I wanted to change into.  I knew that I needed to move to the great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee. So I moved, got divorced, changed my religion, and learned I had extra abilities. I became kinder and more patient.

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         I do not follow the Jewish religion anymore     

  What is your religion now?         Other faiths- New age.   I am now a Wiccan, Pagan spiritualist. I  now believe in the whole source of vibrations and light.  
  
  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     Nothing that I was taught to believe before  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     Could not practice that religion any longer  

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   It was murmuring voice letting me know that I had to go back  
  
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

  During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     I was raised Jewish and what we were taught about the afterlife was definitely not what I experienced or I learned. I learned that we are here many times. We have many lives and many experiences. It’s all about picking what lesson  you want to learn, learning them, and moving on to a higher source of consciousness  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I learned we are all one giant collective of conscious humans. It’s  like a school. We are all here learning and having these human experiences  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I know that we all come from a source of light and love. Beings like aliens and other Beings exist and are here to help our souls have earthly experiences  
  
Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I am here to speed the message of love.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     We are here to learn lessons to evolve our soul so that we can become higher Beings who are greatly connected to source. We must have these human experiences to achieve the higher levels of consciousness in the universe. Love is the key.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.     I now know how this game on earth goes why we're here what we need to do and that if we don’t learn the lessons we need to learn.  We have to go and do it once more until we have the complete, earthly experience mastered.  
  
  Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     I know when my Final death will come. I know when everyone’s death will come  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     These hardships and challenges occur to help  a person  learned the lessons, consistent with the soul contract.  For me, it’s to step into my power, let go of fear, and embrace love  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     Love is all that is real. Love is what our souls are here to achieve; pure unadulterated love for all. I  think of it as a Christ consciousness or a Buddha consciousness. I feel like they may have been one in the same  
  
What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     I know now what is real.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes  

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It’s hard to explain to people the true meaning of love because that’s all there is. Love is all that exists after this life. Love is wholeness in life.  I don’t think humans or most humans can grasp that feeling  
  
  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I can reach into myself and remember it like my experience like it was yesterday  
  
  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I do readings and can tell someone what they want to know about their future. Or I can just read exactly how someone’s feeling and what’s going on in their life. It surprises me after all these years and even to this day.  
  
  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          It was all meaningful to me; from not knowing who I was when I came back, to the experience of talking with the Beings. It changed my life  
  
  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I have only shared it a handful of times with people. I think  helps them to raise their vibration  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     My whole life has changed from it. It’s definitely real and feels amazing  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I just know it was  
  
  At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Uncertain   That it was a wonderful, life-altering experience  
  
Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Yes  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I ended up getting divorced and moving 2400 miles away
