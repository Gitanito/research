INTRODUCTION.
The publication of the present work, at this
peculiar time, will naturally awaken the curi-
osity of the public mind to a marvellous extent
and as there is existing, among the human family,
so great a diversity of opinion, in regard to the
second appearing of the Messiah, numerous will
be the inquiries in relation to the truth of what
is herein set forth.
The author would therefore briefly state that,
in the compilation of this work, he has studiously
avoided the introduction of any matter except
that which came under his immediate notice, or
which he has derived from authenticated sources.
Vlll INTRODUCTION.
No opinion which he may entertain in regard to
the reality of the mysterious toork, will be ex-
pressed ; his object being to display it before his
readers in the same light in which he himself
beheld it, reserving to those who may favour
these pages with a perusal, the privilege of pass-
ing upon it such a verdict as they may entertain.
With this brief introduction, the work is respect-
fully submitted.
PART I
VISITATION
DISTINGUISHED CHARACTERS.
The existence of a body of people associated
together under the appellation of " Shakers," is
generally known to the public. That a great
deal of prejudice, caused by a misunderstanding
of the true character of that strange people exists,
the author is fully aware, having been connected
with the " United Society of Believers in the
Millenial Church" for some length of time,
during which period he has had a fair oppor-
tunity of arriving at a correct knowledge con-
cerning the doctrines and principles of the people
composing it.
Being desirous, therefore, of giving publicity
to the subject matter contained in this work, by
presenting a plain, unvarnished statement of those
strange and marvellous scenes to which he has
10
been an eye-witue.ss, he trusts that what shall be
here related, will be regarded as the simple truth,
divested of all artificial colouring.
Deeming it needless to enter into a minute
history of the rise and progress of the Shakers,
we shall merely advert to the most important
transactions that have taken place among that
people, in order to bring the mind of the reader
to an understanding of the subject.
Sixty years have elapsed since the establish-
ment of the '* Millenial Church" in the United
States. During that time its increase has besn
gradual, and several thousands of souls have been
gathered to Zion, as it is called. At the present
time, branches of the society are located in the
states of New York, Connecticut, New Hamp-
shire, Ohio and Kentucky: the settlements at
New Lebanon and Watervliet, in the State of
New York, contain the greatest number of
members.
That portion of the society located at Water-
vliet, near the City of Albany, where the author
of this work has resided, numbers about three
hundred souls.
The gifts of God have been manifested in this
people in a very marvellous manner. For a
period of many years they have been especially
II
favoured with spiritual gifts and operations
;
among which may be mentioned, as most pro-
.rainent, the gifts of prophecy, speaking with un-
knov/n tongues, discerning of spirits, and holding
communication with the spiritual world. Very
frequently they are seized with a rapid whirling
and violent twitching of the body, which they are
unable to repress. We have seen numbers in
this manner caught up by some invisible power
and whirled around the meeting room at an
almost incredible rate, some proclaiming the
word of tlie Lord to his people, while others
would be discoursing in unknown language, and
holding converse with angels and other heavenly
spirits.
It is believed that these operations have been
displayed for a number of years ; but, more re-
cently, there has been another manifestation of
God's divine power toward his " peculiar peo-
ple," which, in magnificence of conception, far
exceeds all others, and which, when universally
known, will add much in confirmation of the
general opinion that the Millenial day is nigh at
hand.
It was at New Lebanon that this new dispen-
sation was received, in a communication from the
spiritual world, announcing that the lattei day
12
was near at hand, and would soon be ushered m
by the developing of the strange work promised
by the Lord:—"Behold ye, and wonder mar-
vellously; for I will work a work in your day,
which ye will not believe though it be told you."
*' Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for lo, I
come ; and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith
the Lord. And many nations shall be joined to
the Lord in that day, and shall be my people
:
and I will dwell in the midst of thee ; and thou
shait know that the Lord of Hosts hath sent me
unto thee." '* Yea, many people and strong
nations shall come to seek the Lord of Hosts in
Jerusalem, and to pray before the Lord." "And
this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in
all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and
then shall the end come."
Accordingly, the work began to develope itself
in a manner that nearly astounded many who
witnessed its approach ; but as they, the people
of God, hnd ever preserved tlieir faith firm and
unshaken, in regard to every previous display of
His wondrous power, they were unwilling to
entertain the shadow of a doubt in relation to
this last manifestation. Tliey consequently
laboured in spirit for an increase of faith and
spiritual strength, to enable them to go forth in
13
every gift of God, however mysterious and dark-
ening to the natural understanding, keeping in
view the divine truth, that '* the natural man re*
ceiveth not the things of the spirit."
Disembodied spirits began to take possession
of the bodies of the brethren and sisters ; and
thus, by using them as instruments, made them-
selves known by speaking through the individuals
whom they had got into ; after which they were
welcomed to Zion to hear the true Gospel of
Christ.-
it must be borne in mind that, while the breth-
ren and sisters are under this influence, they seem
unconscious of the fact that they are other than
the spirit for whom they are acting; and even
when the spirits of others have left them, and the
return of their own spirit, to its natural abiding
place, brings them to a slate of recollection, they
retain no knowledge of what has transpired, and
utter exclamations of surprise when apprised of
the fact by those who were eye and ear- witnesses
of the scene.
We shall now proceed to a description of some
of the distinguished individuals who have, at dif-
ferent periods, severally appeared at New Leba-
non and Watervliet, in the State of New York.
George WAgHiNGioN, to whom we ?haU havt
14
occasion to make allusion hereafter, was among^
the first that made themselves known in this
manner.
His spirit had been often discerned, by those
who were gifted with spiritual sight, before he
made his name and purposes known through
one of the brethren, whose body was thus so
signally honoured by the spirit of that illustrious
man.
George gave some particulars concerning the
discharge of his earthly duties while sojourning
upon this terrestrial globe, and concluding with
congratulating himsolf upon the opportunity
availed of entering into communion with those
who were walking in the *«pure Gospel light."
He informed them (the elders) that he was
commissioned of heaven with the important and
responsible duty of ministering to the wants of
thousands and tens of thousands of departed
spirits, who were wandering about in search of
happiness. That he was to conduct the nations
of the earth to Zion, where all, whether in or out
of the body, must eventually come to find salva-
tion. In accordance with this divine commission,
the elders ratified the appointment of Geoige
Washington, who has proved himself a faith-
ful minister indeed, having already sent many
15
thousands to the True Church, where they have
rapidly progressed in the way of God.
In the course of the work we shall notice the
different nations in the order in which they ar-
rived ; but, for the present, individuals of distin-
guished popularity, many of whom have been
dead for thousands of years, will occupy our
attention.
It may be proper here to state that we shall
avoid any unnecessary detail of the conversation
of spiritual individuals ; and shall only describe
such conversation as shall be deemed of an inter-
esting character. This course is adopted in
order to guard against wearying the patience of
the reader.
Many of the statesmen of the American Revo-
lution, among whom John Adams and Thomas
Jefferson were most prominent, have, through
the influence of Washington, appeared ; and by
their acts have proved themselves good believers
in the Millenial Chuich, and faithful followers
of Christ.
General Harrison, whose withdrawal from
earth while in possession of the presidency of
a mighty republic, and whose departure was
accompanied by universal lamentation, has
come to Zion, and, after staling his name and
16
circumstances, has been joyfully weicomed to
an associatioQ wiiii the people of God ; which
privilege he gladly accepted, and is now among
the heavenly spirits who are singing eternal
praises to the Almighty Father.
William Penn makes an occasional visit to
the Shakers on earth, and he- himself is a valua*
ble instrument in the hands of God ; being very
efficient in conducting the tribes of Indians to
the peaceful vale in Zion.
William has at dilFerent times spoken of his
bodily sufferings, caused by the persecution he
received in his native country, England, while
maintaining his religious principles. He de-
scribed his progress through life, from early
boyhood to the period of his death. He spoke
of the struggles he had, and of the difficulties he
had to encounter, in endeavouring to establish
those principles of Quakerism for which he so
long and strenuously contended ; of the opposi-
tion he met with from his father, which was of
such a nature that he was several times forbade
entering his house ; and, likewise, of the hostility
entertained toward him by the leaders of the
established church, which was also of such an
unchristian and uncharitable spirit, that he was im-
prisoned for daring to avow his dearly cherished
IT
jM'iiiciples. He dwelt at some length upon the
grant of land tendered hin:i by King Charles ;
?ind of the establishment of the colony which re-
ceived the name of Pennsylvania.
He expressed the strongest sympathy for the
poor Indians ; and when told of the wrongs in-
flicted upon them from time to time, he niani-
fe«;ted the deepest concern.
William ha>!, bv his maornanimous conduct in
favour of the different tribes of Indians that have
jippeared among *' Believers," so completely
won their respect and admiration, that he is
called *' Father Penn;" and when some new
tribe of the red men mav arrive, and be inclined
to be noisy, they are always obedient to every
request or command of ** Father Penn."
William Penn, who, while on earth, supported
so strenuously the principles of the Quakers, has
become a faithful adherent to the doctiines and
principles of the Shakers; being persuaded that
the latter sect of people, by abstaining from
tleshly works of every nature, live more in the
spirit of Christ than any other sect of religionists
upon earth. He says that he lived up to the best
light received in that day; but that had the testi-
mony of the true Gospel of the Church of Christ
been opened, at that time, he should certainly
}inve espoused it.
18
Napoleon Bonaparte, whose extraordinary
career of warlike achievements have rendered
his name at least immortal, has long since been
called to the home of the faithful.
As the history of this wonderful man is so
universally known to the whole world, it were
needless to repeat the account of his many war-
like deeds as given by himself, when he arrived.
Suffice it to say, he has humbled himself suffi-
ciently to become one of Christ's followers, and
those who could hear him discourse, would
wonder at the mighty change which has been
wrought in that once all-powerful man. Yes,
the spirit of that Napoleon, before whose invin-
cible power nations trembled, is now upon an
equality with the meanest soldiers of his vast
armies. But kings and princes all must come
down from their thrones and mingle with the
dust of the earth.
Stephen Girard, well known as a distin-
guished millionaire of Philadelphia, and the
founder of the magnificent edifice, bearing the
name of the Girard ' College, which is being
erected at Philadelphia, came in spirit, and re-
ceived a hearty welcome.
He gave a very interesting account of himself.
He stated that after he departed this life, he
found himself on the banks of the Delaware
19
river, at some distance below Philadelphia,
where he had been wandering to and fro for
some time, until he heard the sound of a trum-
pet, which attracted him to this place, (Zion.)
He related some incidents illustrative of his
rapid increase in worldly wealth, and gave an
account of his wife, wherein he spoke of the
circumstance related in his biography, concern-
ing the affair between her and the American
officer.
Girard made anxious inquiries about the dis-
position of the property which he had bequeathed
to the city of Philadelphia, and particularly in
relation to the progress of the College; and,
when apprised of the fact that it was not yet
completed, he manifested his surprise in terms
of disapprobation. The Elders advised him not
to trouble himself about worldly matters now,
as he had been called hither for quite a different
purpose, and he must, consequently, be prepared
to receive such advice and instruction as would
render him worthy of an association with the
inhabitants of Christ's kingdom.
Accepting, with a willing mind, the offer of
salvation, Stephen Girard has become a believer
in the Millenial Church,
Mahomet, the celebrated imposter, made
himself known at New Lebanon, and created
quite a sensation. It was an arduous task to
bring his mind to a conformity with the princi-
ples of "Believers," notwithstanding he ac-
knowledged having endured all the torments of
hell, as the punishment inflicted upon him for
his wicked deeds committed while upon earth.
After v/itnessing the order and plan of worship
of the Shakers,—which privilege was allowed
him by the elders, on several occasions,—his
high sensed notions fell, and he could not refrain
from an expression of his admiration of the
beautiful and systematic arrangement of the order
of worship adopted by the people of God. He
admitted that the order of marching was much
superior to that of his best disciplined soldiers;
and he eagerly accepted the profferred privilege
to "go forth in the dances of them that mab
merry."
Mahomet confessed and repented of the sin oj
having deceived his countrymen, and those who
followed him, and who believed his false doc-
trines and representations.
A large number of Arabs accompanied their
leader, Mahomet, and, like him, were highly
pleased with every thing which met their view at
New Lebanon.
.it
21
Not having had the opportunity of being
present where Mahomet made his spiritual
advent, we have presented the preceding brief
account of him, as narrated by one of the elders
presiding over the Society a! New Lebanon.
. Pope Pius came one day, and received a
hearty welcome from the elders of the Church,
who were much pleased at the opportunity thus
aiforded of having a conversation with the head
of the Church of Rome.
The Pope was, apparently, in a depressed
state of mind. He depicted the horrors of hell,
in which, he said, he had been ever since he left
the earth. He stated that he had not been burn-
ing in z.fire^ as understood in a literal sense; but
he described it as a more terrible scourge—a con-
tinual fire of anguish within, which was gradually
consuming him, and which it was impossible to
extinguish or assuage. He was sensible that
this torture had been inflicted as a punishment
for various criminal acts committed upon eartli,
while in the exercise of his Papal authority.
His holiness, the Pope, maintained considera-
^^J|igh sense on the occasion of his first ap-
p^pnce, and, notwithstanding the affliction he
was subjected to, manifested all the dignity
TKShdaut upon the power and authority of his
22
eartlily potentateship. Soon after his arrival,
he was joined by two members of his Ecclesias-
tical Council, who showed the same reverence
for him which they did while existing in the
body, and seemed sflrprised when informed that
all the vast power which the Pope had been
possessed of, formerly, had departed from him,
and that he was now not only in a destitute situ-
ation, but in a deplorable state cf suffering, from
which nought but an honest confession of, and
atonement for all sin, could relieve him.
It was not until a great deal of argument and
persuasion, on the part of the elders, had been
employed, that the Pope manifested a willing-
ness to humble himself to this humiliating con-
dition ; and he pleaded his high rank in extenua-
tion of various scenes of debauchery and sensu-
ality, in which he hesitated not to confess having
been a conspicuous actor.
He urged it as a strange thing that he who had
possessed the Keys of St. Peter, should have to
make confession to those who were his advisers
at this time. He was, however, wrought upon
to such an extent that he finally becam^
vinced of the absolute necessity of acting
the advice of his counsellors, and expressed
23
willingness to unite with the True Church of
Christ.
The Pope, together with his friends, were
then despauched to a mansion at a short distance,
where, they were told, all matters connected
with their future welfare would be arranged.
Several other departed Popes came likewise.
Among them were Leo X., and Clement VII.
All of them acknowledgded the committal of
much crime in their public and private relations
but having repented of it, they have been
gathered among t ;e faithful.
Bishop James Doyle, of tha County of Car-
low, Ireland, was introduced in the room, during
a meeting of worship, by some nuns from a
convent in Ireland. The nuns made a criminal
charge, of a serious nature, against the Bishop.
The Bishop repelled the charge, at first, but,
being overwhelmed with the powerful testimony
of the nuns, he was forced to acknowledge that
he had been guilty of the most licentious conduct
towards some of the female occupants of a nun-
nery in Ireland, where he had occasion to visit
in his clerical capacity.
He was charged with excessive debauchery,
of every description ; drunkenness being a com-
2^
24
mon habit with him. Yet, as the nuns said,
there were few persons without the walls of the
convent that were acquainted with his irregular
habits. The Bishop, however, seemed sorry for
his offences, ar^d, after confessing his sins, gave
promise of great improvement. Since that time
he has b; en a frequent visitor at the meetings—i-
sometimes bringing spiritual presents from the
heavenly hosts. Rapid has been Bishop Doyle's
progress in the way of God since he c^me to the
''Believers;" and so highly is he estimated in
the spiritual world, that he has had conferred
upon him the high situation of Messenger from
Heaven to " Wisdom's Valley," (Watervliet).
Numerous other Catholic priests have been
summoned to Zion, and, when they came, they
were not unfrequently accompanied by nuns, su-
periors, and abbesses, with whom they were as-
sociated. Children of the priests have likewise
accompanied their parents.
Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland,
came to Watervliet, in the month of March last,
but as we were not present on the occasion, we
are unable to give his account of himself. We
believe, however, that he was in quite a com-
fortable state when he came out of the deep sleep
jnto which he had been cast after departing this
25
life, and that he seemed much interested while
listening to the remarks of the elders in relation
to the subject of eternal salvation. Saint Patrick
is now a good Shaker.
Sampson, celebrated in the Book of Judges,
as a m?n possessed of extraordinary streng'h,
came, with a number of the Philistines, whom
he had slain aforetime. Some of the Lords of
the Philistines discoursed about their god Dagon,
which they worshipped with great veneration.
Those of the brethren who were gifted with
spiritual sight, described the Philistines as being
ten feet high, or thereabouts.
Alexander the Great, his father, Philip,
with their generals and officers of state, came to
Watervleit. Alexander boasted of his many
brilliant achievements in the world, and, for a
timei maintained a proud and haughty disposi-
tion. He made some allusion to the events of
his life, and stated that he was convinced that it
was through excessive drinking that his death
had been accelerated. He stated that he had
seen George Washington, and that individual had
directed them to " Wisdom's Valley." On being
made acquainted with the noble character of
Washington, and of the services which he had
rendered to his country while on earth, Alexan-
26
der seemed much interested, and expressed his
desire and determination to cultivate an acquaint-
ance with that illustrious man.
Mary, Queen of Scots, made her presence
known in a bold and haughty manner. She
maintained this proud demeanor for some time,
ridiculing, in the most scornful style possible,
the plainness and simplicity of eveiy thing which
met her view, affirming that she was deserving
of more honour and favour than was bestowed
upon her. It was with difficulty that she could
be brought to entertain a knowledge of her true
situation.
Being questioned as to what kind of a state
she had been in, since leaving the world, she
seemed unconscious of the fact that she had
died, although she said she had endured much
tribulation and affliction of spirit.
Queen Anne accompanied Mary; and they
seemed to enjoy each other's company marvel-
lously well.
Anne was acquainted with Mary's history,
while Mary was entirely ignorant of hers; and
it was amusing to hear these two queens con-
versing about matters and affairs of state, as
though they were still in the body. They were,
however, soon weaaed from their attachmeut to
27
subjects of worldly excitement, and directed
their attention to a consideration of the neces-
sity of adopting measures to secure the salva-
tion of their souls.
Queen Elizabeth has been a *' believer" for
some time. We have little knowledge of the
circumstances attending the arrival of this queen
among the Shakers, save the knowledge of her
having arrived and received faith in the doctrines
of the Millennial Church.
King Charles II., and George I., came
about the same time with other English sove-
reigns, among whom were Edwy and Elgiva.
King Edwy and Queen Elgiva reigned in
England at an early period. They related an
interesting and melancholy story of their devoted
attachment to each other; and spoke of the per-
secution which they received from the monks,
which they had incurred from having married
contrary to their advice and desire. These two
lovers manifested great devotion to each other
upon this occasion, and conversed about the
mutual happiness they were in the enjoyment
of, before being separated by the cruel persecu-
tion of their enemies.
By their story, which was a melancholy one,
indeed, it seems that Elgiva was put to death in
28
the raost cruel manner imaginable ; and that the
grief, occasioned by the loss of his beloved con-
sort, caused the death of Edvvy soon after.
General Brock, the British officer who fell
in the battle at Queenston Heights, during the
last war between the United States and Great
Britain, made himself known at the meetings,
and in his deportment presented quite a dig-
nified appearance.
The general made some statements in regard
to his conduct at the battle, which we are told
corresponds with what is related of him in the
historical account of the affair.
He acted under the impression that he was
still habited in the regimental dress which cover-
ed him when he fell upon the field of glory,
pierced with musket balls.
On the occasion of his first visit he seemed
desirous of attracting the particular notice of
those who were in the body, and seemed much
chagrined when he observed that other spirits
present, at the time, received the same degree
of attention as that which was bestowed upon
him.
General Lafayette has united himself with
the church, and occasionally makes a visit to
his associates in the body. Washington and
29
Lafayette are inseparable friends in the world of
spirits.
Marshal Ney, General Bertrand, and
other of Napoleon's officers, presented them-
selves and conversed gaily and enthusiastically
about the engagements in which they Were con-
spicuous actors.
Nero, the Roman emperor, whose cruelties
have stamped him as a tyrant of the worst de-
scription, entered into the body of one of the
brethren, and discoursed at length in relation to
his past conduct. It was evident that he had
become duly convinced of the atrocity and enor-
mity of his crimes, and was repentant. From
his appearance, we judged that he was afflicted
with intense mental suffering, indicating that the
fires of hell were raging in his bosom.
Osceola, the celebrated chief of the Seminole
tribe of Indians, manifested a very friendly dis-
position toward the '* shiny white folks," as he
termed those who were in the body, and who
conversed with him. This warrior was accom-
panied by several other Indians of his tribe, all
of whom paid much attention to the remarks of
their advisers.
Alexander Pope, the poet, we have under-
stood, has come and associated with the society.
30
Queen Charlotte, of Africaj made her ap=
pearance in quite a dignified and haughty style.
She affirmed that she reigned in Africa, many
centuries ago, and that the state of the country,
while under her imperial sway, was highly pros-
perous.
We have understood that Saint John of Pat-
mos, King David, and some of the Apostles,
have likewise returned from the world of spirits,
and have made themselves known through the
instrumentality of the brethren of the Millenial
Church.
RETURN OF THE PASSENGERS OF
THE PRESIDENT.
Early in March, 1843, the passengers of the
lost steamship President, whose fate has been,
hitherto, unknown, arrived at Watervliet, an-
nounced their names, and related the circum-
stances connected with the loss of the vessel and
crew.
Captain Roberts, Mr. Tyrone Power, the
Rev. George Cookman, and the Messrs. Lans-
DOWNE, with others of that ill-fated ship, suc-
ceeded in "getting in," and communicated the
dreadful tidings in relation to the destrudtion of
31
the vessel, and the loss of all who were on
board.
We can readily imagine the surprise that the
announcement of any information calculated to
throw light upon the subject of the loss of the
President, will awaken, and shall therefore pro-
ceed to give the description of the affair, as
related by Mr, Power, one of the passengers:
" My name is Tyrone Power. My profession,
while on earth, was that of a comedian. I am
a native of Ireland, and was, at the time of this
disaster, on my return to my native country from
the United States, having been eminently suc-
cessful with my business. I had with me a large
sum of money, the fruits of my labour, and was
fondly anticipating the joy I should experience
in rejoining my family. But my fond expecta-
tions were not to be realised, and I was doomed
to a watery grave. After being out a few days,
a tremendous hurricane arose, and the agitation
of the sea threatened annihilation and destruction
hourly. It was, I believe, just after we had
passed out of sight of the George's Bank, that
we were driven, with tremendous force, against i
an iceberg, and the vessel immediately went to
pieces.
3
32
**lt was in the night, and awful was the scene
that ensued. Brief it was, yet, nevertheless,
terrible beyond any thing I had ever conceived
of; so that I feel a sensation of horror while
dwelling upon the scene of that awful night. I
believe I was one of the last that went down;
having seized part of the vessel, to which I clung
as long as possible, not with the expectation of
being preserved from death—no ! the last ray of
hope had departed the very instant the vessel
struck, and we were scalded by the hot steam
—
but I desired to prolong my life a few moments,
to afford me time sufficient to enable me to com-
mend my soul to that God toward whom I then
became sensible I had been too much a stranger.
After performing this duty, I felt an inward plea-
sure which assured me that His mercy had not
been invoked in vain; and I mentally expressed
my regret at not having employed my time and
talents more profitable to myself and acceptable
to him. While the air was rent with the cries
and lamentations of my fellow-passengers, I dis-
tinguished the voice of my dear friend Cookman,
(a clergyman, who is here to speak for himself,)
j^engaged in an earnest and eloquent appeal to
God ; invoking his mercy upon all. In a few
moments I sank beneath the waters, which closed
as
over me; and that is about all the information I
can impart in relation to the dreadful occur-
rence."
Mr. Power made inquiries concerning his wife
and family, and was told by the elders that they
could give him no intelligence respecting them,
for they had never heard of him before.
They endeavoured to console him, by saying
that his family were doubtless provided for, and
exhorted him to turn his attention to the object
for which he was brought hither. He, together
with Mr. Cookman, who, by his own account,
was a clergyman of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, paid particular attention to the remarks
of the elders, and were apparently pleased with
the prospect of soon finding the place of eternal
rest and happiness.
Mr. Cookman rejoiced that he had found the
True Church of Christ. He had laboured under
the impression that the church to which he had
been attached was the right one, but now that it
was made manifest to him that he had, while
upon earth, mistaken the road, he would endea-
vour to rectify the error, by doing all the good in
his power to other wandering souls whom he
should meet while traversing the world of spirits.
34
He was informed that John Wesley had long
since become a *' Believer," which intelligence
he received with exceeding great joy; express-
ing a desire to see and converse with that great
and good man. He was rejoiced to hear that
there was every prospect of his soon being in
the enjoyment of that privilege.
These spirits were then directed to spiritual
elders, by whom they would be assisted in their
onward progress for the attainment of the king-
dom of God.
PASSENGERS OF THE WILLIAM
BROWN.
Shortly after the arrival of the passengers of
the President, some of those of the William
Brown, packet ship, of Philadelphia, made their
appearance. They were principally natives of
Ireland. They described their sufferings in de-
tail, but as the circumstances must be well
known to our readers, we shall refrain from a
repetition of the sufferings of the passengers.
PART II.
INDISCRIMINATE CHARACTERS
OF
DIFFERENT NATIONS.
INDIAN TRIBES,
We believe that the North American Indians,
of various tribes, was the first nation that came
in a body to New Lebanon and Watervliet. The
Indians were first conducted by George Wash-
ington; but since the arrival of William Penn,
and his connection with the church, Washington
has conferred upon him the duty of ministering
to their wants and necessities.
Among the various tribes, were the Mohicans,
the Mohawks, Delawares, Pawnees, Shawnese,
Seminoles, Cherokees, Chickasaws, Choctaws,
Cohocsinks, and many others, whose names we
cannot call to mind at the present time. The
Indians and squaws were said to be about the
premises in great numbers. They seiaom came
into meeting, except when they were called.
3*
36
The manner of calling them into the mee ings,
during worship, was by singing in imitation of
the sounding of a trumpet; when the spirits of
the "natives" would spring into, and take pos-
session of, the bodies of the brethren and sisters.
They all seemed to recognise each other. The
Chief, Chiefess, the Prophet, and the Warrior,
most generally came together. The joy at meet-
ing together seemed to be very animating; and
so great was the noise which, they made by
dancing around, singing, and sounding their war-
whoop, that it was almost deafening. They
were very fond of dancing, and occupied nearly
the whole time, while in the meeting-room, in
the indulgence of that recreative amusement.
They would frequently gratify the company by
singing some of their native songs and ditties.
There was an old squaw there, known by
the name of So-le-an-ti, who was quite a fa-
vourite with her native friends. She would
make frequent visits, and act as an instruc-
tor to the tribes, initiating them in the art of
dancing according to the manner of " Believers."
The Indians showed, by their conversation, a
great fondness for George Washington, or
"Shiny George," as they called him, and
''Father William Penn."
37
An old Indian (we say old, because he said
he was an aged man when he died) alleged that
he came from beyond the Rocky Mountains, and
stated that where he lived there existed a race of
very large animals; and, from the description
which he gave, we were led to the conclusion
that he had reference to that species called the
Mastodon, or Mammoth, the bones of which
animal have been found in different parts of the
United States. This Indian could not give us
information in regard to the amount of time which
had elapsed since his departure from this terres-
trial world into the world of spirits. He seemed
to think, however, that a considerable length of
time must have elapsed, from the fact of his hav-
ing but little recollection of the events of his life.
ESQUIMAUX.
The Esquimaux Indians presented a singular
and ludicrous appearance by moving about the
floor, while in a kind of sitting posture, and per-
forming the actions requisite for the driving of
dogs in sledges, which is a common occupation
with the Esquimaux. They would move about
the floor, give a whistle, and accompany it with a
motion of the hand, as though they were flour-
ishing a whip.
m
Their manner of conversing was by a kind of
gurgling sound made in the throat, and as unlike
any known language as it possibly could be.
MEXICANS.
A tribe of the Mexican Indians, who lived
before the invasion of the Spaniards, came also.
PERUVIANS.
Indians, from Peru, and a tribe called the Ari-
canians, natives of Chili, have likewise attended
the meetings. They came on several occasions,
and spoke of the battles which they had fought
with the white men who came over the water.
PATAGONIANS.
The Patagonians came about the same time
with the other tribes of the Indians of South
America.
LAPLANDERS, &c.
The Laplanders and Greenlanders exercised
themselves with, apparently, skating about the
floor. The scene was extremely ludicrous and
amusing. There were about thirty, of both
sexes,-—the greater number being females,
—
moving about the room with the same degree of
S9
rapidity, and in the same manner, as though they
were actually skating on the ice of their own
dreary countries.
SIBERIANS.
The Siberians came in large numbers. They
appeared to have a melancholy sort of air about
them; walking about with their arms folded
across their breasts, and conversing together in a
doleful manner.
ARABS.
The Arabs visited us very frequently, and the
scenes enacted by them were particularly amu-
sing. Sometimes they would indulge their felo-
nious disposition to a great extent, seizing every
article which came within their reach, and endea-
vour to secrete it.
Some of the Arabs would imagine that they
had their caravans with them ; and it was a diffi-
cult task to convince them that they had left the
body, and were in a spiritual state.
They spoke in terms of adoration of the great
Mahomet, and some of them gave a descrip-
tion of his tomb at Medina.
There were various tribes of the Arabs in the
liabit of visiting; some of them being more civi-
/ 40
lised than others. Some had seen and wor-
shipped the living Mahomet, while there were
others who had never heard of him ; the latter,
as a matter of course, having lived prior to the
birth of the celebrated impostor.
ABYSSINIANS.
The Abyssinians introduced themselves in a
boisterous manner, jumping about and exercising
their lungs to such an extent that they seemed
almost frantic. Dancing they enjoyed very
much. They exhibited a great depravity of
manners, and, for a time, would not listen to
counsel nor advice of any kind,
HOTTENTOTS.
The Hottentots exhibited all the ignorance and
disgusting habits characteristic of them, and were
slow to receive instruction.
WALES.
Only three individuals came from Wales.
They were members of one family. They
seemed pleased when they recognised one
another, for they had been separated a long
time. The family consisted of the father,
mother, and one daughter.
4i
SCOTLAND.
A family from Scotland came ; but from what
part of the country we did not ascertain. They
said there were a great many of their nation
preparing to come, among them several of the
kings, chiefs, and nobles of Scotland. It was
said that King Macbeth was there, endeavouring
to "get in," but he did not succeed,
Ireland:
But the nation which has eclipsed all others,
as far as regards numbers, and the frequency of
visits, is the Irish nation. They have repeatedly
appeared at the meetings, and not unfrequently
remained in the bodies they inhabited pro tem-
pore^ for a period of two or three days.
We have already given some account of the
visitation of Irish priests and bishops.
There were several Irish families that made
themselves known, and recounted their histories.
Several who had been drowned and killed in
different ways, told interesting stories about
themselves. Some of them spoke their native
Gaelic, and others discoursed in the real Irish
brogue.
42
FRANCE.
Besides Lafayette, Napoleon, and others which
we have mentioned, there arrived numerous
ladies and gentlemen of France. A French
gentleman, of the name of Monsieur Guishong,
came in, strutted about with an air of importance,
and flourished his snufF box, of the contents of
which his lady, who was present, partook ; and
they seemed a happy couple, indeed.
One of the queens of England, being present
on the occasion, was bewailing her wretched
condition. She excited the sympathetic feelings
of the French lady so powerfully, that, " sans
ceremonie,^^ she walked up to her husband, in-
serted her hand into his pocket, drew forth his
purse, and tendered a portion of the contents to
the poor, disconsolate queen. The proffered
present was, however, refused by that illustrious
personage, who averred that money could avail
nothing toward relieving her mind of the bur-
den which weighed upon it.
SPAIN.
It is our conviction that there has been but a
very few of this nation called among the Shakers
as yet. We recollect, however, one female
43
spirit, who came, stating that she had received
information from her spiritual associates that
some of the popes were in hell.
GRECIANS.
A party of Grecians, among them being the
Emperor, arrived, and, by their manners, gave
assurance that in civilisation and refinement they
could not be excelled. They lived during the
most flourishing period of that nation's existence,
when the arts and sciences were at the highest
state of improvement.
It seemed to them that they had been in a
lethargic and unconscious state since the period
of their leaving the world ; until awakened by
the sound of a '* mighty trumpet," which at-
tracted them to Watervliet. They seemed de-
sirous of eliciting all the information they could
obtain in relation to their future conduct.
PERSIANS.
The Persians were similar to the Grecians in
refinement of manners, and, like them, eagerly
embraced the Gospel, as they said it seemed as
though something was lacking necessary to the
completion of their happiness.
4
T4
TURKS-
Some of thepe people seemed very ferotiotss
and disagreeable in their actions. The femalesj
when they appeared, invariably covered their
faces with veils.
MOORS;
There came six Moorish spirits, who had been
drowned from a boat in which they were sailing.
But for the recollection of having drowned, they
believed they were still alive, until positively
assured of the contrary.
CHINESE.
The Emperor and Empress of China, with
several princes, mandarins, and officers of state,
were conducted to Zion, and there displayed
their characteristics. They conversed but little.
AFRICANS.
Numerous classes and grades of the African
race have, at various times, visited at Watervliet.
They exhibited all the qualities appertaining to
the natural character of the negro; dancing and
singing with wild delight, and imitating every
45
movement which they observed among the
whites.
There were several who had been slaves in
the Southern States of North America. They
described their sufferinors in such a manner that
o
tears were actually drawn from their hearers*
From the tenor of their stories it would seem
that the most cruel manner of toiture which
could be devised, had been inflicted upon some
i of these slaves, as a punishment for the most
trivial offences.
LOO-CHOO ISLANDERS,
'
The Loo-Choo Islanders made a favourable
j
impression by their quiet and solemn demeanour.
They appeared desirous of advancing in the
true faith; and apparently enjoyed much pleasure
by worshipping God in the dance. One of ihem
sang a very pretty song which was justly ad-
j
mired by all who heard it.
JEWS.
j
The ancient Jews, who crucified our Lord and
Saviour, Jesus Christ, came in great numbers;
,
many of them succeeding in getting into the
^
bodies of the brethren.
I
They stated that since leaving the body, about
46
eighteen centuries ago, they had been wandering
about the earth, during which time they had re-
ceived the conviction that he whom they had
reviled and crucified, was, in verity, the Son of
God.
They asserted that the cause of their unbelief
was the fact of Jesus being of obscure birth
;
while, in the person of the Messiah, they ex-
pected a descendant from the line of kings.
They gave a very interesting account of the
manner of the Crucifixion, and of the disappear-
ance of the body on the " third day." This
corresponded with the Scriptural account of the
Crucifixion and the Ascension.
The Jews conducted themselves with great
propriety upon this occasion, and all of them,
together with the High Priest, evinced considera-
ble interest in relation to the progress of Christi-
anity in this day.
Joseph of Arimathea, who received from the
governor the body of Jesus, and laid it in the
sepulchre, was said to be present on this occa-
sion. He did not succeed, however, in "getting
in," and making himself known, as some of the
others did.
These sons and daughters of the tribe of Judah
expressed much concern respecting their descend-
47
snts in the world ; upon which they were inform-
ed that the poor Jews were scattered far and
wide throughout the earth; and that a large ma-
jority of them remained in the same state of
imbelief in regard to the fulfilled prophecy re-
specting the first advent of the Messiah, not-
withstanding many had been converted to Chris*
tianity. They manifested a strong desire that
those who were now living in the world
should be convinced of their error, and receive
the true faith into their souls, whereupon they
were encouraged by the expressed hope and
opinion of the elders, that the Almighty Father
would infuse his holy spirit into their souls, so
that, in due time, they would be called into the
path which leads to everlasting glory.

NOTE:
HAVING REFERENCE TO MILLERISM.
On one occasion, during divine service at Water-
vliet, the word of the Lord came unto one of the
females, urging upon the inhabitants of Zion to
refrain from questioning the correctness of, or
exercising judgment in relation to the work
which had been given to the world in the name
of Miller, such being the work of God, intro-
duced for the purpose of carrying out his all-
wise and mysterious plans.
This, our readers will readily observe, has
reference to the remarkable revival and religious
excitement which has followed Mr. Miller's in-
terpretation and understanding of the Scriptures
in relation to the termination of the world, and
the establishment of Christ's kingdom upon
earth.
CONCLUSION.
Having thus endeavoured to give a brief
account of this marvellous work of the latter
day, we shall proceed to sum up the whole
matter.
We have adverted to the return of a large
number of spirits, that have existed at different
periods since the creation of the world ;
yet it
is evident, to every reader, that there are still
numbers to return, ere the work can be said to
approximate toward its completion. As it is our
impression that the work is still in course of
progression among the Shakers, or *' Society of
Believers," the probability is, that a vast multi-
tude of spirits have arrived since the author left
the Society. Respecting this, however, he is in
6(S
210 possession of no intelligence to communicate
to hi? readers.
As ihis is the first intimation of this subject
which has been made to the world, various
©pinions, in regard to the matter, will doubtless
be entertained. Those who are acquainted with
the character of the Shakers, knowing them to
be, in every respect, an exemplary and truly
religious people, will, we think, be inclined to
entertain a doubting spirit in regard to the truth
of our statement. For we feel sensible, that
they can scarcely persuade themselves to believe
that such a people, who profess to act in accord-
ance with the divine precepts of the *'meek and
lowly Saviour," and hold him up as a bright
example for all to follow, could be guilty of an
assumption of power such as the Almighty^
alone, can confer upon mortal man.
If confirmation of the facts herein recited may
be required, it is only necessary for us to refer
the inquirer to the members of the "United
Society," either at Watervliet or New Lebanon j
none of whom will feel a disposition to deny the
51
truth of our statement, disinclined as they may
be to the inhabitants of a lost world receiving a
knowledge of that which they are incapable of
understanding. The object which has caused
the matter to be held in privacy, and confined to
the society alone, is, that it was deemed inex-
pedient to apprise '*the world " of these things,
for the alleged reason that the people, not under-
standing spiritual matters, would hesitate to
believe, and it would be, therefore, *' throwing
pearls to swine;" for *'the natural man receiv-
eth not the things of the spirit, for they are
darkness to him."
We have avoided entering into a minute detail
of the actions and conversations of the indis-
criminate spirits of the several nations, as such
a course would, doubtless, prove uninteresting
to the reader. We believe that we proceeded
far enough with our description to show, that, if
the work is not a reality, it is a most faithful
representation of character, and such as would
do honour to eminent stage performers.
6Z
We desire to state, in conclusion, that, should
an interest be manifested in relation to this pub-
lication sufficient to warrant the issue of a
second edition, any additional facts which may
come within the scope of our knowledge, shall
be added to the work, and such errors as may be
delected in this, will be corrected in the next
edition ; our object being to give as full and
accurate a description of the subject as possible.
