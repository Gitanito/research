After I had the drug, I must have dropped. All I remember was flying forward, chest first. 

I was surrounded by black endless space all around me. I stopped flying forward when I realized I was in a different place other than earth. I looked up, there was endless space above like it went on for eternity. I looked down and the black endless space went on forever. I looked left and right and it was the same thing. I wasn't scared at all. Then I looked at my hands, I didn't have any hands. All I could see was not my body but the outline of my body and hands. It was all the colors of the rainbow in stripes or red, yellow, green, blue, purple etc. Then I said to myself 'f$&@ this I'm not staying here!' 

Then all of a sudden, BOOM! I woke up throwing up and saw ambulance people around me, they gave me a drug to counteract overdose. I remember thinking I didn't think you were allowed to swear 'up there' when dead or whatever, but I did. I can draw what I looked like spot on; even now the memory is clear as day. I think I stopped flying when in the tunnel and chose to come back. I changed my life after that.
