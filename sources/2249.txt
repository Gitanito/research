CONFESSIONS OF AMAGNETISER.
CHAPTER I.
TnE desultory, manner in which we hal'e sketched our experience,
with a hasty hand, we hope may find an excuse in the fact of our un-
practiced pen, and the proscrjbed limits in which we write. We have
folll)wed no fixed purpose, but have written that which we have to say
quite at random. The reader will find some curious facts related
here; but all have been expenenced by the author, and that he has
not come to his conclusions without good authority for so doing, and
until proving the matter, we beg you to believe. These remarks, per-
haps might be more properly embraced in a preface, but who readu
the preface of a book ? Very few certainly, and therefore we have
taken the liberty thus to preface our 'confessions.' Looking through .
these 1
specs' dear reader, 'now gather and surmise.'
That there is much truth and much humbug in the science ofl\fag-
neli!<m, if it deserve the name of science, no reasonable man will
doubt ; at the same time it is too true that it is made the agent of
great abuse and impropriety. I am one of those who believe that
there is a certain will within the cultivation of every powerful mind,
which may be so exercised over the dorma11t powers of another, as

to rrnd~r the object or pE>rson, for the time being, subject to the au-
thority or 1d,h of the acti1·c agt•nt. ,
l'or instance, if you, kill() re.ader, ll't•re willing to subject )OUrself
to the power of ;\lngnetism, you must first scat your;;clf, acquire nn
agreeable and quiet state of mind, be perfec•ly willing, or ratlu:r ex-
crt no will n•minst the proce~s, nnd your mind or brain lwcomcs

tricity, and becoming for the time aud until that agency shall cease,
the master of the body of thC' subject, its own mind being 110 longer
actil'e.
I do not design to prove the truth or actual existence of thi:~ sin-
gular agency, and therefore shall not go into an elaborate di:scussion
of its principles, but propose sirnply to throw out such h111ts n!l ~hall
ena!.lc the render to undenannd my ~tory. I do humbly believe I hat
::\faguetism may be made tl)C means of doin~ much good, iu allcvin-
ting extreme pain, in cases of nervous affections, and when it is ne-
crssnry to perform any !'urgical operation, inasmuch as the patient is
rendered for the time being, when in the perfect or rigid state, insen-
sible to all outll'ard feeling or pain. Thus many of the fir;::t phyRi-
cians of Boston and other citic::, can hear testimony to haviug fully
tested the matter in some most trying and important cases of surgical
opcr~ttions, such as amputations and the like.
There nrc thousand:;; of intelligent minds in this city, which being
struck at first by some really n5lounding exhibitions. or proof of the
singular powers of Animal )lagnctism, render at once blind belief to
all it pretends to, and being convinced at the outset,of a hidtlrn or
unseen agency, tht'y arc rcudy to concede e1·ery thing o
its p J\I'C!r that the Mcsmeriscr, in his ingrnuity. may lay down or cc-
l'i~e. Now I ha1·c studied son1c\1 hat thi~ action of the will, the pe-
culiar operation of this agency, and can find it ouly powerful as I ha\·e
nprcsscd, in alle1·inting tJain, as any prompt anodyne might do, nnd
in rendering the subject for the time beiug completely within tloe con-
trol of the :.\lesmeriser.
l\luch has been written and said, and many have borne witnc!ls to
the priuciple of clairvoyance as existing in the magnetised person.
This principle is that of sight aud power independent of cithrr th-:::
subjects natural abilities, or the capacity of the 1\Te~meriser, nnd a
person in this state is beliel'ed to be able to see and describe correct-
CONf'ESSIONS OJ.<' A MAGNETJSER. 7
Jy any place independent o( space ntH! time, without hnvin11 either
c
seen or heard of that place before, and of which the 1\Iesmeriser is
equ.llly igr.orant. 1 hn,·e labored hard, and with those said to he the
best of subjet:ts to pro,ve if this be so, but have never been alile to
find a 1wrson who in any stage of the mngnetic state could perform
t~uch a miracle. On the contrary, I ha,·e ever found that the subJeds,
however acute under the influence, however susceptihlt>, or perfect in
rhi:i state, can only reflect the mind aud power of the Metimeriser, or
the person with whom they are put in communication, hy means of
the ,U.lscneriser, creating a degree of sympathy between them in the
U$ual 111'\nner. ln such a case, the indi•idual put in communication,
takes the place for the time being of the 1\le~meri:<er.
I woald say here that I believe the prescrit.in~ of medicine in cast's
of sickness, by a per.;on in t~•e mesmeric ~tate a perfect hun.hug! for
thi~ rPason. Being- placed in communication with tllf~ ailing person,
the suhject forthwith reflects the sick one':; thoug~•ts, influenced, per-
haps, in some measure by the jurlgment of the Mesmeriser. Fur in
stance, if you are r.onvinced in your own miud that you ar!l nffitcted

ised prrson, f•r examinatinn in relation to your he.tlth, thc1t per:~ •II, as
I!Ooa as the sympathy i& perfet;t1 re:lects your own uait11l, and will saY,,

course of treatment, if necessary, to convince you of the fact. In
nin did the friend declare that the would-be-Doctor was a vile person
and could bear experimenting upon, it was all to no purpose. The
medicine was perfectly innocent, aud as it did not cure, the deceased
was incurable !
This prescribing for the sick through the agency of a mesmerised
person, is carried to a much greater extent in this city than is gener-
ally known. I could mention eight practitioners at this time, now
engnged in this employment. I nlso know one or two married ladies
perfectly conscientious in this matter, pe:sons irreproachable iu mor-
als and standing in society, who being magnetised by their husbands,
prescribe for the sick aml\ng their friends. This be!ng done grntui-
tously, it would seem hard not to award at least the mead ofsincerity
to such. The fact is they are themselves deceived, being told on
their awaking from the tranct'1 or unconscious state in which they
_..., have heen, that which they have said and done, and knowing very
well that they havll not the power to discover these things in the nat-
ural state, they become convinced of the truth of cl<tirvoyance, and
actually practice the art from a sense of duty to their fellow beings.
The point most to be dreaded in this agency of the nervo-vital flu-
id is, that bPing within the reach of nearly e\·ery one, it may not uo-
frequcntly fdll into improper hr.nds. Some are far more powerful
than others ; the ability in this agency being susceptible of an accu-
rate aualysis, a~ it is graded according to the powers of the mind, and
the ability to concentrate the will, and the resolution to be obeyed.
Thus he who possesses these qualities in an eminent degree becomes
of course a powerful mngnetiser. Let a person of strong mind, of
good int$11ectual faculties, exert this power over another, ano the per-
son so afft.tcted will thrive in the very faculties which predominate in
the Magnetiser, while on the contrary, if a pP.rson, say for instance,
who pusse;;ses a poor m•·mory, sha~ frequently mesmeri:<e any one in-
dividual, that suhjCCt will inevitably experience the same inconven-
ience. II~w ~ong the effect may remain 1 will not pretend to say,
but that tlus ~mgular effect will be produced, I know from actual and
careful observation.

CONFESSIONS OF A .MAGNETISER.
CHAPTER II.
As the reader will undoubtedly infer, I have been a practical Mag-
netiser, and for a long time was as much carried away by its supposed ·
capabilities, as ever was the most ardent devotee; but like all who are
determined to prove their belief, let it relate to whate,·er subject it
may, I was not long in 'finding my level.' As I propose to be honest
in this expose, I will frankly acknowledge, that when I found out the
deception that had been practiced upon me, and in which I had been
an innoceut agent of deception to others, I did not do as I should have
done.--In the first place I was ashamed to acknowl~dge my error,
being actuated by a false pride, which led me rather to cleave to false-
hood tha~ to acknowledge my error. And then again it gave rne
sweet pleasure, the practice of this singular agency, inasmuch as by
it I possessed a mysterious power over my subject or patient, who of-
tentimes were of the gentler sex.
Reader, Jet me tell you that to be placed opposite a young and love-
ly female, who has subjected herself to the process for the purpose of
effecting a cure of some nervous affection or otherwise, to look into
her gentle eyes, soft and beaming with confidence and trust, is singu-
lar entrancing. You assume her hands, which are clasped in your own,
you look intently upon the pupils of her eyes, which as the power be-
comes more and more visible in her person, evince the tenderest re-
gard, until they close in dreamy and as it were $piritual affection.-
Then is her mind all your own, and she will evince ffie most tender
solicitude and care for your good. Your will then becom«>s not only
as law to her, but it is the greatest happiness to her to execute your
smallest wish; :ohe is perfectly happy, (unless your natural tempera-

ment and habit differ widely} in the stran;te sympathy that 11011 ext"'t~
octwcr.n you. Self i~ emirely swallowed up in the ~:arnest rec;arrl
th••t actuates the subject, and they will Hop at uo poiut beyond 11 hich
they uny alford you pleasure should you indicate it bj thou~ht or
word.
Now I a~:, is not this a most dangerous agency that can so !SUbject
the must npnght minds to 1he will of the unprincipled and oft~n­
timcs higl&ly immoral practitioner ?
And then 11gain it is the same in relation to this matter of tile nf-
fecuons as. it is in the in~tance of the mind, fot· as it ''ill !Jef!l'l an evil
effecr upon the memory of tho l:iuhject who shall be operated upon
frequcutly by one peculiarly defection in that point, so does it produce
a strange and ardent affection in the subject, wbo shall be magueriscd
uy one of the opposite sex, particularly if he himself be actuated hf
u wi~h to leave such an impression ; and who is there among u::t all
who due!3 not wish to please ? In this conuection, I would ohl!ervt~
thnt I hal'e heard a pnu:titioner openly avow that he could choose hill
wife from among his p:~tients wh<'u he pll.'ased, possessing all he ditl
the poii'N of magnetism to thl: full extent, meaning to acco111plish the
dcsirahlc object when the proper tit11e should arri1 e through the agen-
cy of hi' art.
In lll.t.,;n<:ti~ing l.tl intli,·itlual of t:1e other sex, I ha1·e ever assumed
:uthc ont~et of the operati•m, the must mild and g<:ntle frame of
nrind. I ha\'c e1·er given full play to I he warmth of allcction that ev-
ery refined mind mu:,.t expcrirnrf! toward:~ the fcmal2 heart. And I
!>ave <:ver >e<'u thi:4 fcehng a thousand f'olcl more ardent in the subject.

stRnce of my offence, and that, a:i in duty bounc.l, l was ready, and
should he but too happy to expiate my offence by any re.ttionablc (lCn-
auco she shoulc.l inflict. But the lady was inconsolable or rathrr ir-
reconcilable, and at length findiug to what extent she proposed to car-
ry her r~sentrncnt, I told her 1 would entirely change her feelings to-
wards me if she would gi1•e me her attention for a few minutes.-
Thi::; she ngreed to do, declaring however that it was impos~ible. I
seated myself bcfure her, anc.l in a lew moment,; unc.lalrnust IJefore she

be re1narkably sul!ceptible to the in£lue'lce.
I allowed her to relllain thus for nenrly half an hour, suhject to the
ex1mination of her friends with "hum she wuc; at the time. In the

ty would be thoroughly awakened to the danger of permitting public-
ly the exercise and employment of this agency. The ruin and utter
destruction of many a domestic circle n.ust eventually follow, and in
one case I already know the greatest unhappiness to exist. ThP.re is
no punishment too severe for one who will take advantage of a person
when in the helpless condition to which Magnetism reduces them, and
he who would commit that most heinous offence, would also put his
hand into the subject'3 pocket and abstract wbateYer might be there
of value. His punishment must come sooner or later ; justice abid-
cth her time.
Here is a solitary instance in which we know the culpability of the
operator, and bow many more may there be all around us ? Nay,
there is hardly any one, be he naturall1 ever so strong miuded and
virtuously inclined, that could withstand the 10eries of temptations
hat a practical :\lagnetiser must encounter. I have found tllis so,
and although I call my l\Iaker to witness that I have never betrayed
confidence placed in me by the mennest thing in existence, so far as
any nctual deed of sin is concerned, yet ha\·e I followed the art as I
have before said for the sake in a great measure of the delight expe-
rienced in fomale society, while in the exercise of the power of Mag-
netism. I could recount in thi~ connection and in illustration of mv
pO!ition, scenes that would move the most stoical person on earth. ·

CHAPTER Ill.
.l\1r. Sunderland not long since astonished our good cihzens by a
boast that he could magnetise a certnin numhcr of his audtt>nce
while lecturing to them, and in proof of this assertion, he agreed on
the next evening, to throw several of thr. audience into the mesn1eric
state, each one thus effected to be a perfect stranger to the speal<er,
(l\1r. Sunderland himself.) Now my purpose in alluding to the c~se
is, to show the reader how much the imngination has to do in the
matter. Here are an audi1•ncP. of :>ome two thousand people, princi-
pally composed of the middling cla~~es of the community, all absorb-
ed with the wonderful experiment th~y are anticillating.
The lecture, commE>nces by telling them,with much confidetH'P that
certain members ofthe body before hun will soon fall a$leep. Well,
now it is very strange if there are not some in so large and hrtereo-
genous a compound of human nature, weak mindl'd enough •o have
their nerves affected by this announcemf>nt. They beconae agit~ted,
watch intently the speakf>r, and sure enough they do become affectl?d.
Entering into the spirit of the lecture, e~ch expecting that it naay be
he or she that is to be affected, become maQ"neti>ed in reality. This
reasoning i\Jr. Sunderland must ackno,,lcdgP. himself, to be corrrct;
.and thus we account for what has bccu as:,erted by many to he the
most ~>ingular experimeat ever publicly made. Thea e i~ one still
more singular, yet explainable on the same :grounds, relative to the
imagination.
Let any one make a bow-knot of ribbon and pin it to the wall on a
range with the eye of any naturally nervously inclined person, tell
them to look intently upon it and it will magneti'>c them; ten to one

my happiness was alre:~dy too perfl•ct in the sweet being ll<'fore me
to express such a feeling. She would not spare me a moment 'io
leave her, hnt nestling by my side seemed happy only then. Ir you
never experienced such a scene, you caunot fully appreciate the feel-
ings ofthe operator ; he cannot act independent of this dependency;
this ::ffcction ~o regardlessly sho'' n I.Jcfo1e husband, friends and all!
There was n perfect abandon in the exhihition of regard on the partof
the sui.Jject that I never saw in any other case or instance. I t is a
singular expression ( kuow, and poets s1y that we can Jove truly but
once, yet I ha,·e Jo,·ed, n}E', and \\ith my \ibolc heart an hundred
times, while in l'uch a sttuntion as I ha,·e just described. It would
be a ~toical heart indeetl that could resist such tcmptati?ns, and not
give play at least to the impulse of the heart in the affections for the
moment.
Again I al-k, is it not a oangerous agency that will so net upon, and
even control the strongest minds? You can make but one reply to
this query.
I sat one afternoon in my room, when a gentleman entered accom-
panied by a young and beautiful female; it was his daughter. lie in
formed me that from the effects of a :-.erious fright :ibout six months
previous, she had ne\'er ~ince enjoyed a single night or indeed an
hour of natural :.Jeep.! Tint the effect of anodynes however potent
or simple had ever been to throw her into a wakeful p~t half torpid
state in which she T>ould apparently forget lwrsclf, while her eyes
wert• still wide open. Ile wished to try the elfccts of magnctisJil.-
Hc observed that he had very little faith in the art, but that he
was unwilling to leave any reasnnaule rP.medy untried and therefore
he had called upon me. After a few moments con,·crsation, I found
by experiment that the young lady was perfectly susceptible, and after
announcing the fact a~ked if J should proceed. IT u, ing the consent
of both, I commenced at once. Here again I cut loose every cord
that bound my heart. I threw my whole soul into my eyes, and the
ohject before me was one whose personal beauty called every powec
of admiration into action.
She was but just seventeen, and possessed of ns perfect form and
features, as one may ha\·e dreamed of, but nc,er seen. Strange f
infatuation-! could hn,·e worshipped the lovely girl at that moment,
when I saw how wholly she was in my power, how confiding she was,
how thoughtful of my every movement, and seemingly jealou:~ lest I
16 COt\l'ESSIONS 01-' t\ l\IAGNETJSER.
should remove even my eyes from her person. Well, she cnjoycd a
aound and refreshing slt!ep, for such is the effect of the rnngn(:tic in-
fluence; the p·1rent saw it and was happy. At the expiration •of a lit-
tle more than an hour, I awol<e her iu the usual manner. V\'hen she
left the room, ~he did not do a~ ,he h:.d entered it, careless of its oc-
cupant, myself. Ah no! her eyes were l>ent blushingly upon the
ground, and her heart was in IllY keeping !
From that moment, 1 felt convinced, and believe so still, that there
is created through this agency of magnetism, not only a feeling of
affection in the heart of the subject, but that there is ai!'O a corres-
pondinr sympathy aroust>cl in the breast of the operator. Day after
day that young and beautiful girl came to my rooms and was operated
upon, unknown to her parents. Singular as it may appear to those who
do not understand the effect of this agency upon the nerves, the first ex-
periment entirely cured her, and her natural sleep returned to her at
night as heretofore ! She was bound to me by this new sympathy
over which she had uo control, a11d w:1s unhappy unless we met at
least once a day.
Ho1v I loved that gentle, thoughtless girl! I was about five years
her se:Jior, and our dispositions were singularly alike. Time rolled
on, and this tender and gentle girl was d:1ily more and more attached
to me by our frequent meeting. I was poor; her wealth placed me
far belo~v her, but her fond parent wished only for his child's happi-
ness-and but u few monts intervened iu our more mature acquaint-
ance, when we were married! From that hour I forswore magnetism,
which all my experience showed me could be made the agent of so
much evil. Although my wife had first been won by a stranae and
hidden agency, yet now she lo1·ed me through the natural chan°nels of
the heart's affection, and I was h11ppy indeed!

CHAPTER IV.
We had been married about three years; m
.v dear Eugenia and my-
self; and I defy the world to produce a happier couple or fa sweeter
home. '\Ve sat one evening reading aloud to each other, our little
boy asleep in the cradle hard by, when a sen•ant entered and handed
me a note. I read the singular contents which were as follows :
Dear Sir:
You were once a practical l\Iagnetiser. I know you discarded
the pra~tice of the art from principle, and therefore I do not fear to
trust you, for I too understand its principles. I hope you will once.

row noon at the hour of 12 .l\1. at the .Exch<lnge Reading R oom. I
will there speak to you.
RespectfuJIy,
One who needs your aid.
To R. S. EsQ."
Placing the note in my pocket, I continued my reading, but my
wife interrupted me by asking the purport of the letter. I turned the
subject adroitly, determining to find out the object and purpose of the
wnter before I made the matter •known even to rny wife, her from
whom I had no secrets. 'fhe letter was written in a bold and manly
18 t.:ONFESSIONS <;F A ::\I.\G.N£TISER·
hand, and I felt no ~mall degree of curiosity to l;no11 1ts author,
wlirrefore I :nrnitl!d somewhat impntiently the coming of the <~Jfpoint­
ed time, when 1 resol ,·ed to meet 11 ith the writer as Ito had propo-
sed.
The appointed time arrived, and at the place designntcd I met with
my unknowu correspondent. lie was a young and gentlemanly look-
ing person of some two and twenty ye:tr$1 and struck one at first sight
as n gcntll•man at henrt, and in erery particular. He proposed that
II'C should take a hotel hard uy1 and there disCUSS tJJe UUSiiiCSS upon
which he had acldres,ed me on the previous night. I a:>sented, and
followiug him to the Exchange Cotn~c Ho<~se, we were soon close by
our~t·lves and deep in conversation.
1
Ynu received my note of ye~terday ?' he asked.
'I did.'

cd that you will l>e doing good therei.Jy ?'
1
If convinced, 1 am.'
c l\Iay ! confide in you ?'
c Most implicitly.'
'I thank you sincerely.'
Here followcd a pause, as I awaitt>d for him to open the subject-he
at length ol>sened, after much he!'itation :
' I know not what to say.'
'If I can serve you consistently with my honor and self-respect,
speak freely,' said I. 'You need POt hesitate to make known your
wishes. I uuderstand you to speak in confidence.'
· Extending his hand to me, 11 ith warm and eloquent language, he
thanked me for my kindness and proceeded to say :
'From my earliest remembrance, I hn,·e lo1·ed and heen betrothed
to Helen 'V---, a~ hir and lo1 ely a l.Jemg as nature {;I'Cr blessed.

sence, another suitor, attracted by the lnrge fortune she commands,
has well nigh supplanted me 111 her afii.•ctions, and by his cunf.tant ot-
tentiou~ will, I fear, eventually, if he has not already completely alie-
nated her love from me. He ulre:uly ahsorbs her whole attention by
his ingenious manreuvres and agreeable accomph:.hments.'
'.N<>W l\1r. \V-- leaves his daughter to choose freely for hersPif,
and though he favors my suit, yet he will use uo argument I know with
Helt!n in my fa, or. Thus 1 nm left to look on terms ami sec my~lf
supplanted by one whvm 1 know to IJe unwarthy. Now tell me :~ir,
canuot magnetism be made to operate here to my advantage, aud also
for the ~ood of the lady? I have thought of every other mode to ae-
compli:;h my purpose, but cannot succc<'d. Now I know that you oi!r
carded the art from a con,•ictiou of tis evils, and we l>oth know th:\t it
contains some truth~, and perhaps imporaut ones too, notwithstnnd
ing the sea of humbug it is made to fioat in-therefore I have deter-
mined to consult with you in thi,; matter. Can JOU, w1ll you assist

sistent, a'> I bare l>cfore ol>·<.:rved, with tr.y sense of self-respect ;:nd

'Do you renlly heliere that this agency may be mndc to accomplish
my most earnest wish?'
Properly €X<'rcbcd-yes'
c D1u I not kuow your indepPndencc in pecuni:1ry matters I would
offer ynu any sum of money, would you but promise to try the cxper

'J f I WPre to rccei,·e p:~y for snch :m engngement, I should break a

tice ofthi:~ ngency.'
' llut will you con;~ent to nid me?'
'You have stated the ca:.e to me honestly?'
'I will sweur it.'
After a few muments thought, aud some ordinnry enquiries of h1m,
relati\'e to the matta, I wa:s well satisfi,.d with his auswerll, and agreed
to urulertuke his plan, which was was to endeavor to fix the afiections
of Helen upon himself, aud to alicuHe them from any other object,
I found tl. at :llthough he had never b<'· n nble to magnetize himself
yet he pcrleclly understood th~ principles of the art, which h~ explain..
ed upon philosophical principles, and iu the only reasonahl~ man-
ner. Our plan was ui fvllows. I \\ 1:; to be introduced into tl1e famil1

of Mr W--- as n friend of !.\lr. I\1 ilton, who had so lou;: heen en-
gaged to H elen. I was then to endeavor, if possible, to accomplish
my purpose in part without any open operation that might excite sus-
picion-or at least 1 was not to attempt any thing opeuly, until I
11hould have obtained such influence over the lady as to ensure suc-
cess.
On a certain erening accordingly, 1 was introduced into th~ family
of Mr. W---, :111d was at once struck with the great personal beau-
ty of Helen, as w~ll as charmed with the accomplishments of h<-r mind.
But through all and every point, I could dt1tect the one failing of fick-
leness. Said I to myself, if I can be the agent of fixing h<'r purpo~e
and affections, and thus add stability of purpose to her nffcctions, I
shall certainly be doing a good act. And so I resohed to attempt to
accomplish my objE'ct, let the result r•rove to be what it might. I n
this frame of mind and thus purposing, 1 addressed her with a feel-
ing almost of admiratifln for her beauty of pc>rson and mind:
'1\liss \ V---,' I said to Helen, ' I thiuk I never saw a face in
which the science ofPhysiogrwmy could so plainly be proved as in the
Jnstnnce of yourl'elt:'
'Iudeed sir, arrd pray how would you interpret its legends as the
bierologi..ts say of the ancient inscriptious1'
The reader will at onc.-e perceive that my ohject in entering upon
the suhjE>ct of Phy:~iognonry was to <'nnl>le me to rest my eyes much
upon her face, and thus get her nttention, and albO if possible to rnake
roy~elf in some degree agreeable.
'1\l :ry I be nssured ofgiving no offence if I trauslate freely, and as
the text shall strike me7' I continued.
'i\lnst certainly; and I shall he much amused to see my mind, and
peculiarities of dispo~rtion reflected before me, as in my person from
n mirror. ll•ll can thio:~ bP. po~;.il>le 1 1 have never had much faith in
Phr·ingnomy, C.,r I have often been cJcccivPd by it.'
'You shall :>re how correctly 1 will ~peale, and then decide for your-
Eelf as to the correctness of the :;cience, which is the only one, by the
by, that is not made the foundation for some species of humbug.'

CHAPTER V.
I n \O tnlcen especial care to inform myself relative to the general
character of l\liss Helen W--- through 1\lr. Milton, but aside from
that iuformation, I could read in her beautiful countenance so undis·
guist'<l and open in its exprc~sion, nl•arly every decided trait of char- ·
acter "he possessed; I bPgan upon this theme as I have before observ-
ed, for the 1•urpose of establishing a friendly relation between us, and
u a good co\·er under which I might approach her, for as to any open
exhibttion ofmagnetism, I knew that she in common with many others,
abhorred the idea, believing it only the im·ention ofdeceivers.
Wtth my eyes fixecl earnestly upon her face, I said, 'I read here
that yuu nrc very frank.'
'Thank you,' said she.
• Nay, you are too much so.'
'Thank you again, fcJr nc>w I believe I may expect something like
truth. J see you do not wish to n.•uer roe.'
'You gi\·e your confidence at once, and without considering either
the northiness or the 1111\\orthiness of the object.'
'l\l.1y be so,' she ~aid, thoughtfully.
' You :ne fond of music.'
'The•c instruments might signiry that,' said she, pointing to a harp
and piano that ornam~n:ed the room.
'True, but they do not say that while you love to play upon them,
are not able to accompany them with your voice, I think you cannot
sing. Am I right, lady!'
' Very truly spoken.'
'I mean to be understood that while you are fond of music, yet you

play mechanically, and still there is no Inc:, of harmony in your dispo-
sition. Your harmony of eye, if I may so e'<press myself~ l hhould
~a'y exceeded your harmony of sound. You love to sec coJ.,r:; cor-
rectly l>leudcd; that is, iu good taste, and much eficct, a well painted
landscape.'
'I do above all thingo;.'
All this time she was looking intently upun me, and had e1 ru takea
a nearer seat, though apparently without understanding or eitlwr rcal-
izlllg that ::.he did so, so interested had she bt·coule. r contirnH'c! with
my eyes resting upon her with nil the respect, yet tender feeling ex-
pressed in them that I could command.
'You are l'eryfond ofnew things,' said I.
' \Vho is not, pray ?'
'I think that, for instance, now you hare become familiar with this
harp, you would prefer any other style of the instrument to the one
you po~sess.'
'Why, I had thought of tins withir1 this I'Cry hour; say, Mr. Mil-
ton, is uotthis friend of yours a conjuror?'
' To gi1•e this trait or pr"pensity the proper name, I should sny that
you are fickle in your regard for ant ohject, and sometime,, (you
know I am translating, not originating,) changeable, nay, quito ~;o iu
your purpose.'
'Frank, upon my word.'
'Have{ olfendcd?'
'No sir, I gave you liberty at the out~et.'
'But I see you do not like my interpretations.'
'Perhaps I ought to like it,· said she half to herself, while ::.he toyer!
with her fan; 'I fear it is but too true. (io em, 11ir, if you ple.l"C.-
1 h:td rather you had spoke thus, th1u to think you would flatter me.'
'You are I'cry affectionate,' I continued, 'aucl lo,·e more than reve-
rence your parcnt~-your regard is as freely given as your confidence .
and I should say you were much too ready to share both wnh tho,.r
who are almost strangers to you.
She smiled eoqucLtishly.
'You are gh·en much to the ide~l, anti often build Cltnlt:auT. t'"'l
Espagne, forming glol'.'ing pietur<'s in a fairy future that ne1rr glude
your eyes.'
'You Itnow what. Pope says touching this matter of present happi-
ness; do not all enJOY much by anticipation 1'
CONFESSIONS OF A MAGNETISBR.
'Very true; hut I would speak of this castle-building propensity as
posse,siug a large share of your thoughts. I can sec by your eyes
that you as~ent to the truth of what I say.'
During the wholl." of our com·ersation, I had remained with my eyes
mildly hent on the pupils of hers, and at this stage of the conversa-
tion, I :;aw the usual change taking place. The moments flew fast,
nnd within the hnlf hour from the commencement of our com•flrsation,
Heleu wns in that half dreaming, half wal<eful situation which precedes
the pt>rfect state under the magnetic influence. This was as far as I
dcsignt>d to ~o at this time, yet emlea\·oring strongly to impress upon
her feelings a regard for me; then slipping a moment behind, by the
usual pn!>ses and exertion of the will, I pa~sed off the fluid, and she
revived, while I pretended to cros! the room f•H a book. As she be-
came again completely conscious, she smiled most kiudly on me, ob-
sen·ing,
'I cannot have fallen asleep. •I really beg your pardon. It is
most nnaccountablc. \\'hy, I never was so atr~cted before;' and
poor HPlen blushed with mortific3tion.
We took our leave, but with a still deeper blush, Helen asked me
to call again, and she bid us botll good night with more than usual
courtesy.
A~ we left the house ~Ir. l\Jilton remarked,
'W•·ll, you have certainly bPgun well and succeeded wonderfully;
thank hea\·en, no nne appeared during the conversation, else we might
have heeu suspected.'
' H nve no fear,' I replied, 'I shall u~c all caution in this case, in
which I hnve become deeply interested.'
'You have cPrtainly won her good opinion.'
'It is all I designed to do on my first \·isit, hnt I have found her
peculinrly susceptible, ancl think success is sure.'
'It is strange i cannot acquire Lhe art.'
'You can \l·ith proper understanding as to the application of the
will, and you mu•t forthwith take some IPssons of me, for it will be
well that you should become an active agent yourself, in accomplish;
ing our desired end relative to Helen.'
'I phcc myself under your control, and shall obey implicitly your
instructions.'
'Come to my study then to-morrow at noon.'
'I will be 11unctual.'
CONi''ESSIOXS OF A .MAGNETISER.
And we parted. 1 was highly pleased thns far with the :ahcnture,
and promised myself more enjoyment at least, in carrying out the plan
we had proposed.
.1\tr. 1\lilton was pu~ctual at my study the next day.
'How have you been accustomed to allect your subject,' said I to
him, ' or rather, in what way have you endea1·ored to do so, for you
tell me you have uerer yet succeeded 7'
'First placing my subject in the usual position, and seating myself,
I have taken the hands, and forthwith set myself to will that the sub-
ject should fall asleep, exerting all my powers of mind to conquer
the brain or will of the subject.'
'\Vrong, all wrong, and the plan that has caused thousands to fail
in their attempt. T he subject must be one of the most susceptihle
class who can be thus subjected. Now I care l'ery little about taking
the hands or even touching the subject personally, though I believe
that by so doing you may hasten tl1e effect, and perhaps heighten it.
Now 1 have always endeavored, at the outset of an operation, toes-
tablish between myselfand the subjects, the greatest degree of confi·
dence, and give rise in their minds to a feeling or kindness, in short.
to create a mutual sympathy between us. I then proceed to will
mildly, yet resolutely, combining in my mind a purpose and determi-
nation to succed, with the most affectionate regard for the suhject.-
Then follows almost instantly the result; success is almost cenain.
If, on the contrary, you will harshly, and with all your resolution to
conquer the brain of the subject, your power must be very strong in
the first place, to enable you to overcome the natural repugnance that
such a course will gi1•e birth to in the feelings of the patient at the
moment; ior as you are exercised by a feeling of resentment as it were,
a determination to beconqueror, so must their feelings partake in some
~egree of the same spirit, at least, until they become perfectly magnct-
IzeJ. Follow, therefore, th(' opposite plan in future, if you would
iucceed. I have hopes that you will succeed in this manner.'

CHAPTER VI.
\Vue:-; I p&rted from young :.\Iilton, we made an appointment to call
again at tht: residence of Helen's parents, in pursuance ofour purpose
on the following Thursday. Evening came, and with it my new com-
panion at the appointed hour, and we started for the residence of Mr.
W--. After being announced, we were soon admitted to tht· pres-
ence of Helen, ancl the gracious smile with which she received me in
particular, showpd th:lt I w:1s already a favorite in her he:ut. I should
here observe that I was unkno1vn to the family, nor was I likely to
meet with any one here who would recognize me, and trusting to good
luck, I passed for a young unmarried man, and therefore the repeti-
tion of my \ isit at so early a day caused no particular notice, and pro-
uably no reflection on Helen's mind.
We found her surrounded by the aristocratic sprigs and young fops
of the town, whose mustached faces likened them vastly to the ape
tribe, a!beit those comparatively respectable genus do not wear theae
'attaches.' They were mostly ofthat cl:1s~ that carry their brains in
their pocket, and their accomplishments on their person. My new
friend :\Iilton stood little chance among such fellows; he was a quiet
well informed, and .indeed, thoroughly educated young man, though
in the matter of fashion he was perhaps inferior to those about him, a
most desirable deficiency too, if Helen's companions were taken aa
a model.
Helen immediately evinced an undisguised preference for our soci-
ety, and so decided too, as to elicit the remark ofseveral of the fops
present, one of whom ouserved:
'Who the deuce is this 1\Ir. S--1'
COi\'FESSIONS OF A .:\L\GNETJSER.

0un of the Caoailc,' put in a third indi~nantly.
'Guess he':s from J(am-$/.:at-1.-cr !-ha, ha, ha!' said another Iittlc
fop of a fellow, so tightly laced that he could hardly reco1·cr himself
:.fter the exertion oflaughing at l1is own wit!
Helen o1·erhearin<r these remarks did not hesitate to show them by
c )
her rouduct that she wished a priralr interview with us. This was
doue adroitly, and with the skill of n courtier.
One l>.v one they dropped away, before the hour became lat~, and
bavin;.:- patiently awaited the departure of the llst, 1re were again on
such a footing that 11 e l>oth felt perfectly at home. I enjoyed a hear-
ty laugh nt the Jeaye-taking ofthe little fop, he who had so nearly ex-
tingui::.hed himselfin the exertion attendant upon laughing at his own
wit.
After onu ofthe most stiff and appro1•ed l>ows, he wa\'ed his hand
ga·aciously to Helen, saying:
' Bou soir, any dear l\liss \Y--, bon soir,' and thus he repented
tho only French phrase he knew perhaps a halfdozen times. I doubt
if the !ellow could hare ~pelt that. At length he bowed himself out.
'\\•,.IJ, Mr. Necromancer,' said Belen to me.
'Vall him rather a professor of Physiognomy,' said :;\Iilton; • did he
not read you well ?'
' I think ht> did,' said Helen thoughtfully.
• You acknowledge tho potency of the science, then ?' asl;cd 1\lil-
ton.
' I t is incontrol'ertible.'
• There were some points, perhaps, thnt .1\Jr. S-- dad not speak
of,' Mid .Milton; ' would you llll\'e him Rtil l iurther translate the story
of your oren and tell-tale countenance, Ilelen 1'
Milton spoke tenderly, and I could see from the intonation of his
voice, nud every expression, that he lo1ed her.
'There is one poiut,' satd I, 'as our mutual friend, ::\Jr. ::\Iilton has
suggested, upon 1rhich I would speak more fully if I felt nt libcrty.-
Mj o >jcct at lea~t is a good one.'
'Yo•t ha1·e full permi~sion, and indecrl I e~en esteem it a favor, you
ha1•c treated me so frankly.' '
'My object in warning you against that, which I, as one h:n·ing
studit!d the science, a t once recognize, is because I think you nrc not
aware of possessing the trait yourseJ(.'
CONFESSIONS 01" A l\IAGNETISER. 27
' I am all curiosity, pray go on,' said Helen.
'You rememb<:'r, perhaps, that I spoke of a fickleness of character
\'hich you possess; e~cuse me, I am now acting rrofes~iooully ,' said
I, with mock gravity; 'it is the only point in your general character
tbat I can read, which I would change one iota, Wf're you dearer to
me thnn life itself; but that is a fault.'
I pau~ed a moment to S<'e what effect this decided anuouncemeot
would h:)ve upon hl·r. She turned he•· hca<t from me, aud when I
again met her eyes they were suffused with tears. Supp1c~~ing all
appearance of outward cmllliun, she said:
'I lee! this to be a compliment, though I know you do not mean it
as such.'
'There are few that arc chnJgca.ble with but one great fault,' Ire-
plied.
'You arc very cnndid with me, and I feel strangely willing to listen
to that from your lips that I should not have hearkened to cveu from
Henry,' refcring to young :\Tilton, to whom she looked kindly, and as
if at a lo:-s to account for lh<' singularity of this matter.
'Are you conscious of posse~sing this failing?'
'I am.'
'A sin acknowledged is half repented.'
'Ye><, this fault is mine,' answered Helen.
'I thank you, lor I ha\C certainly a sumed u situation that I have
no right to; yet :o;till with your permissiOn it may perh<1ps be made of
good is~ue. I say I thank }ou, for eren the candor that leads you to
confess this is also depicted in your face, and you hal'e thus un11 itting-
ly bore testimony to tl.e truth of the science.'
During the time of this conver~ati~n J had bent my eye:> constant-
ly, and with the tenderest cxpre~sion upon hf'r, and in a few moments
more of ~cnt:ral remark, I hDd again completely magnetized her!
1 then placed her hands in those of l\Jr. ?IIilton, formed the counec-
tion or sympathy in the usunl rnnnner, und directed him to operate as
I had already instructed him. If<: thr.n conceutrated all his powers
into his will, and desire LO plcn~c, which was tempered by the most
ardent lo1·c. In the meantime I wit:1drew by degrees my own \1 ill
from her hy the usunl exertion of the will and the passes, nnd thus he
gained hi~ own power upon her. Had we not all three been of near-
ly the samP temperament, this might not hn1·e been accomplishrd, but
as it was, it succeeded pc•fcctly, and Ilelen was now completely in
the power of 1\lr. 1\Iilton.
CONl'I::S::iiO:\S OF A MAGNETISER..
~Iy ohject was attained!
He followed implicitly my directions, employing every tender sP.n-
sibility of his heart, perfectly happy in the effect, for Helen ~Showed a
warm affection for him while thus uuder the innuence. He awoke her
gradually, and as she revived he retreated frorn her so as not to excite
ht'r suspicion.
'Did I faint?' asked she.
' Slightly so,' said we both.
'Just forgot your~Self,' continued l\lihon; 'but you ha\'e now quite
recovered yourself, I think, Helen.'
'I am; but how v~ry singular.'
'Sba!l I ring for your maid 7' asked Milton.
'No, I am quite recovered, dear Henry!'
I fairly jumped from the floor with joy at my success. Drar Henry
-that was the word. Dear Henry 1 I was greater at that moment
than Napoleon.
Let me f.·m you, drar I-Jelen,' said 1\liltl)n.

Fr.O;\l n transaent acquaintance I became the most intimatt· friend
of \{r. Milton, and I need not add al:;o of Helen, who really cousider-
ed me as her best friend. She did not understand the agcucy by
which ht~r inconstancy was cured, but rather attributed it to a con-
sciousness ofpossessing the fault as portrayed by Mr. S--, the Phys-
iognomist, (my,;eJf,) and her own inclination to o1·ercomc and conquer
it. She was completely cured, and you ne1·cr saw a couple more de
voutly attached to each other. The secret agent had done its duty
and had its rffect, and was still in operation. If we can once create a
feeli_!)g of sympathy between two pcr:;ons of a proper condition, leave
alone the re~t-there will soon be Jovl' there.
Reader, between ourselves, Hrlcn '\IV-- and Henry Milton were
married not long subsequent to this. There was a rich and arnple for-
tunc w<-nt with the bride, and I felt no envy, for they were so design-

with rearts moulded for each other's sphere ofhappiness. They were
married, I say, and I still w11s esteemed the same friend as before, and
ther~ was e1·er an earnest invitation from ~lilton to \'isit him as often
as I met him in the street.
Like an intemperate man who has resolved to banish from him the
intoxicating cup, and who by some accident has agam got ta:;te ofthe
fatal enemy, 1 was exercised by a strange desire to put again in prac-
tice my power aud propensity. I had sworn an oath never to do so
for pay, bm I longed. for the excitement and srcret gratification that I
had ever e:<.pirienced while in the practice. 1\ly adventure with Bel-

In thr!:> frnmc of mind I called one day on JJelen, now Mrs. 'Triton,
at her new hornr. She received mo 11 ith nil kindness, nud 1 could
see tln1t she felt towards me anything but the cold and ordinnr.v ti·iend-

\\.hat wns to be done 1 I could not rcsi~t the temptation. I found
that uncon:;ciou~ly J loved that gentle 1111d lovPly womnn. I now felt
its fu ll force, nncl by its strange agency she nlso re1•ealed the !!nme re-
gard fur me. 1 hnve before alluded in the,e pngrs to the belief that
the operator in this secret agency is drawn in no small degree towards
the subject, at the same time that lhey e1·ince the most earne~l rq;ard
for the opernwr. In this case I prol'ed the truth ofthe principle with-
out at first realizing 11.
Whnt could I do 1 my whole soul w:ts entranced, yet I knew the
:-in I was committing, nnd still I persevered, ancl drank in the tran-
:;ieut hl;ss of guilty lol'c-guilty 7 doubly guihy; for had I uol a wife

been in. llut there was still my influence len upon her that I could
not remove. Her large and lore bcamin~ eyes were bent nfl'cction-
:llely upvn me in earnest lu1·c. I wa~; hnlf dolirious with ~uwthere<l
pa~~ion. I toolc her huud, ·pressed it to my lips, ;:nd clcchreJ my loi'C
freely.
What was the con,equence1 I looked for contempt-to be upbraid-
ed. ButT had not calculated upon the potency and extent ofthe pow-
er I had exercised. She loved as deeply as myself, the pns~iou was
reciproc:•l. She sank her head upon my breast and 11cpt; at length
rcco1·ering in some measure from her (·xcitcd feelings, she !aid:

'Apparently,' said she.

The incident puzzled me amazingly. I was not in the habit of

CHAPTER. VIll.
As the principal object of this little book of confessions or rather
more properly speaking, this expose of magnetis'll and i1s e1·il effects
is designed and hoped to do some good in forewarning and thusfore_
arming the public against this hydra-headed agency, I cannot refrain
from a~ain calling your serious attention to the evils that may be
producE'd through its agency, and refer you for proof to the two last
chapter'i. Ought its public practice to be tolerated, and in the hands
tOO of designing and sensual men? not possessing the least degree
of shame.

a while over Helen. •
•But you lls.ve told me,' said he,' that this is not necessary after
having once Ol'ercome her brain, you said the effect would remaih
until another should affect her.'
'Yes, yes. I did tell you so, but you know the peculiar manner in
which we effected our object and J fear that some of my own will re
maiDs to the exclusion, in part, ofyours.'
'I did not thin!( of thal.'
' Perhaps you had better operate once more.'
'I will.

'As I have feared,' said I.

lateJ, and 1\l.ich took place between Helen nod myself, nor should I
ha1 e c1 cr alluded tu it again, but for tho hope of doing good by show-
ing the evil infiuence of this agency. I should pt>rhaps here :;ay that
another inducement for me not to lterp it secret, or fear to wound the
feelin:;i of other:~ by making it known, is that 1\lr. i\lilton himself has
since deceased, while hi:; wife, a young nnd handsome widow, with a
fortune, resides near Bologna, in lluly.
In the public C.)>hillition of mesmerism there i'l always more or less
deception practiced. I have seen some most monstrous impositions
minglrd with the few f:lcts that were made manifest to the audience.
Many seeing some f.1irncss and the truth rcsultiug therefrom, or as I
ha1•e before had or.casion to say, finding that there is actually :1 secret
agent, and of which they c:1n take no cognizance through the medium
of th,.ir senses, they are ready to admit nil.
Dr. Colyer, who lectured in this country for some time, was a per-
fect monomaniac on this subject.' IJcaclstrong and impetuous, he c·ver
defeated his own object, and findi11g he had but poorly succeeded in
pr01 ing tltl' truth of the art, in showing it naked to the public, he forth-
with, like many practitioners or this time :llld at this wrt-ing, endeav-
ored to irl\'est it with a l':lSl cloak of humbug, so that almost every
sensible person became disgusted with the \Cry name of 1\lagnNism.
All the truth that there is in the art can easily be explained on ratiorr
al and philosophical principles, and any one who seeks to under-
stan•! it will find th:lt it so;ltl c~ases to be a mystery after a little ex-
aminatron and :;tudy a5 to its general principh·s.
IINI'Cn protect us from the pre~cnl usc to which this a;;ency is
put. If you hen! of a person who prncrices \lcsmerism as a husine~s,
look well to his moral character hcforc you trust him; see that ho
is \\hat he 11houlJ be befor.: you place any confidence in him, and if
you will take the advice of one who !.nows the tricks of the trade you
won't trust to it at all. It i, dangerous ground to trrad upon; I think
l have shown it in my 'confc...,ions' thus far, and that the little gootl
it may possibly do is far more than count~rl>nlnnced by the se:1 of
trouhlc and misrry it may girc rh;e to, and that it is now crealing !rom
day to day.
I once asked a practitioner:
'.How can you thus impose upon the publici'
'Oh, it's not imposition,' said he, 'its only experiment.'
'Rather :1 costly one ~omctimcs,' said I.
:!6 CONI<'ESSIONS OF A .MAGNETISER.
'Am I not" in for it," regularly established?' snid he; I take good
care to do no mischief, and tt.us keep a clear couscieuce.'
There is too much ofthis; there are too many in this trade, and the
pobltc should be warned, that they may guard ag::<inst imposition and
the evils that it may lead to.
The life and adventures of its author and discoverer is somewhat
significant of thP. principles of the art. We prOJIOSe to give a very
condensed sketch of it, purposely to show that the learned men of his
time, as ripe scholars as those of the prcseut day, made light nf the
whole matter. Aud we cannot refraiu from sayiug that if any one
should have succeeded 11r could have done so, it was the indefatiga-
ble and persevering Anthony Mesmer-a man whom no obstacle bar-
red from carrying out his purpose and plan. A man who wns obliged
to fight inch by inch with the medical faculty all over the world, in or-
der to establish what liult> truth there was in his art. Had not Mesmer,
as many of his disciples have done since, endeavored to mystify the
matter, by U:!eless ceremonies and practices. But the disciples have-
followed the master.
Anthony Mesmer was born in Sweden. After attaining to the title
of l\f. D., and having ballasted his ship with the florins of a wealthy
Yl>ling widow, who was but too happy to change her name for the title
of 'Fran Doctorine,' he started on the voyage oflife. He was strong-
ly addictei:l to the study of the magnet and its powers, and what be
termed human electrtcity. At length he stumbled on Animal l\Iag-
netism. He conducted all his experiments with the utmost f;ecresy
and mystery, thus seeking at the outset to clothe the art with a cover-
ing of humbug. After wandering about over a greater part of Eu-
rope, and endeavoring, but in vain, to make proselyt~s, we find him,
in the year 1778, in Paris, where he was endeavoring to establish
himself and his science, but in vain. Nevertheless, it appears on good
authority that the Frllnch :.:ovenunent offered hint an annutty ofl'rren-
ty thousand livres for his ~ecret. Thisolfer Mesmer refused, and what
was the rea~on he adduced for not accepting of it? T!tc ft:ar tlwt it
migltt fall into tltc lumcls of those zolto would ma/;e an improper usc
ofit!
Very ronscientious truly, and yet in less than a tweke month from
the tirne he made this answer to the French go1·ernment, he formed a
aecret society known by the name ofHarmony, if ou r memory serves
us right, at Versailles, when any one, after paying the sum of one huo-

dred Louis d'ors was admitted. Then, after taking a solemn oath to
keep inviolate the secret, was admitted into the arcana of Animal
Magnetism. This speculation is said to have afforded to 1\tesmer the
respectable sum of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Animal
Magnetism having now become the property of the public, was prac-
ticed by clergymen, chevaliers, ~c. In the course of time, many not
content with the revelations already made, overthrew the whole, and
reared such a structure of falsehood and humbug as best suite'd their
own fancy. Mesmer himself was obliged, for some of his sinful acts
in the operations of his art, to seclude himself from •ociety, and esca-
ping to a small town, he died in obscurity.

CHAPTER IX.
I WAS knowing to th~ particulars of n most ingenious robbery com-
mitted through the agency of mesmerism. It 1s n story which I be-
lieve, for a wonder, never found its way into the papers, the party who
was made to suffer on the occas1on, being somewhatsensitive upon the
point.
I was at the dinner-table of Howard's Hotel, Broadway, New York,
sometime in the fall of 1842, where, sitting after dinner, and talking
over the wine, thert> re111ained togethe r three individuals, r.nd directly
opposite to me, so ncar that I could not choo5c but hear evf'ry word
oftheir conversation. One of them, us I afterwards learned, was a
lawyer of New York, another a merchant from the ;;outh, and the third
a forl•igner of what nation I knew not, for he spol;e lilte a native.-
.Apparently, by chance the conversation turned upon Magnetism,
which subject was then the rage in all the Atlantic cities, and in the
mouth ofevery one fond of an argument for or against. I ha1·e noti-
ced that this suhject comes up periodically bdore the public, and ac-
tually rages once n yf'ar, say generally during the long winter even-
ings; perhaps I have been somewhat influenced in writiug my c-onfes-
sions just nt this timP., that I might be in sea~on to serve as a straw in
the scale, at the present time.
'You deny, then, the fact of the mesmeric stale.; said the little for-
eigner.
' In toto,' said the lawyer.
<Nothing but humbug,' said the merchant.
CONFESSIO~S OF A ltiAGNETJSER.
' You can't me:tn that.'
'Never was more in earnest.'
' Nor f,' said the Iawyer.
39
' Now ifI were in the habit of betting,' said tile little foreigner with
a great deal of sanctity, I would lay a wager that I could convince
you as to the actual existence of the mesmeric state in two hours
time.'
'Will you bet upon that,' said the merchant.
' Well, I don't like to bet-its against my principles. I don't care
though, you are so particnlar in the case. I bet you, if you please,
an hundred dollars that I will prove this to you in the time I have spec-
ified.
'Done,' said the merchant.
'Is it a bet?' asked the lawyer.
'Yes,' answered both.
'On this condition,' continued the little foreigner. ' We will all
retire into a private room, and--stay,' said he,' perhaps we can in-
duce this gentleman to participate in the experiment,' alluding to me,
'he being a strnnger to UJ all, shall bt" the judge, if he will so oblige
us.'
''Viii you honor us?' asked the lawyer.
Feeling an interest in the affair, particularly relative to the experi-
ment, I agreed to the propo~ition, and we retired to a pri,•ate room
together. I was personally a stranger to each of the company; in fact
we were all strangers to each other.
The stakes (two one hundred dollar bills) were produced and pla-
ced in the hands of the lawyer, who al:so was to be the subject for the
operation, and the prc'timinaries being all arranged, the little man com-
menced.
lie was very ingenions in his mode of proceedure, commt'n<!in:r by
endeavoring to mystify his subject by his singular manipulations and
mumbling talk, operating like one who knew well all the truth there
was attached to the pmctice, and a vast deal of the sham nlso. I
watched him shre"·dly, for I understood the trade as well as he. A
little more than an hour having passed in this manner, and just as we
were getting prett.Y tired of the nonsense we were witnessing, the ope-
rator pronounced the lawyer to be a~;leep. And so he was.
' Arc you convinced?' asked the foreigner.
'I will experiment first,' said the merchant.
4.0 CONFESSIONS OF A MAGNETISER.
And after satisfying himself that his companion was nctuully in an
unnatural state, to say the least of it, he said:
'I have lost, that's a fact.'
' You acknowledge it?'
'! do.'
' The stakes are mine 1'
'Decidedly,' said the merchant.
'And, Mr. Judge,' said the mesmerizer, you too award the palm to
me1' This question he put to me apparently to make all sure.
'You have won the bet,' said I.
'I'm satisfied; now I'll awake him.'
He proceeded forthwith to awalte ham by the usual means while
the merchant remarked to me rather soully,
'It's the devil's doings.'
'I think not,' said I, 'unless it be that the operator is after that
school. I believe I can explain the matter to your satisfation.'
'Spare your breath-it can't be done.'
' Have patience,' said I, and I proceeded to show the cause and ef-
fect of the phenomenon as to its truth and deceptions.
'Place two bricks side by side,' said I, 'one shall be heated to its
utmost capacity, while the other shall be as cold as it can be made
to be. Place these together and the heateu brick being the most ac-
live agent, will entirely expel the cold from the body it is joined to,
and both will become of a like temperature.'
'What is the applicability of this, pray 7'
'I will show you.'
'I see a flaw in your Smiles already.'
'Perhaps so, but it will serve me for an illustration.'
'Two individuals are placed together-the will and power found
in each is illustrated by the heat and cold. The one is instructed to
become perfectly passive, him r show you in the cold brick-well-'
· 'But it is not well, I tell you I see an absurdity in this.'
'No matter-you will understand my purpose. I'll acknowledge it
a flaw. Well, I say the other exercises his will and mind to its utmost
capacity and tension; in him you have the heated brick. The tem-
perature of the two will asaimulate throngh the power of the nervo-
vital fluid, and the dormant will, must be overcome by the active
agent.'
'This is certainly reasonable.'
CONFESSIONS OF A llfAGNETlSER.
' It is all the philosophy of the art.'
'You understand it then!'
'I clo thus f11r.'
'J have never seen the matter in this light before.'
'True, it is clothed in so much humbug and nonsense that all ·rea-
sonable minds have become disgusted with it; but then there is some
reason and philosophy in the art, nevertheless,' said l.
'By this time the luwer awoke tfrom the trance, he had been in
and was compelled to admit that he had been thrown into the uncon-
ciolls state by the little foreigner, call it what he might.
' I have lost,' said the merchant to the lawyer.
'It appears so to me,' said he rubbing his eyes.
'You all acknowledge that I ha1•e won them!'
' Yes, yes,' ~vas the response.
Whereupon the lawyer took the two bills from his vest pocket
where he had placed them, and handed them both to the operator,
saying: 'you have got that sum doubled at cheap cost.'
' A Iribute to science,' said the discipie of Mesmer, who took an
early moment in which to bow himself from the room.
I sat after his departure talking with the other two gentlemen, while
the time slipped unconsciously by, and the gong sounded for te:~.
'Ve s:!ated together at the table, where we expected to meetour a mes-
meric friend, proposing to induce him still farther to experiment for
our gratification. I had drtermined to show him up, or rather charge
him with the foolish mystery that he endeavored to cast around the
an, and offer to magnetise him, without touching him, for I had al-
ready become convinced by observation that he was very sus-
ceptible. But when we come to look about for him, he was gone.
' Waiter 1' said I.
'Sir.'
'\Vhere is the gentle!J}an who sat opposite at dinner 7 I mean
the little man with large whiskers.'
'Gone, sir.'
'Oh, ho, left has he 1'
'Yes, Sir.'
'Eastward 7'
'No sir, by the Southern line.'
We were liomewhat disappointed nt this announcement, but talk~d
o\·er the theme still, while we retired to the smoking room, and in-
deed most of the ei'CIIing until we retired.
I hnd got fairly cscoused in my bed, pulled the clothes o1·rr my
head to shut out the noi~e that c1·er rages till mid:1ight in a New York
hotel, when suddenly 1 heard a loud ab~upt knock at,rny door. Throw-
in~ on a loose gown, I opened the door, wondering whnt could have

door almost suspcctiu~ foul play, so loud and impatiently was the

into the room.

'Certain of it.'

'Not once.'
'I mused for a moment and the truth flashed upon my mind at once.

CHAPTER X.
Abom si~ Ulonths subsequent to this date of the theft or robbing
that I have just related, I was passing a few weeks in New Orleans
on busines.~; the city of Creoles and masquerade balls. I happened
to step in one day at the supreme court, where I found a case was
trying in which the plaintiff was a highly respectable and wealthy,
citizen; the defendant was a little Frenchman named Perrot, a pub-
lic lecturer.
The charges were just being read to the court as 1 entered and sat
fot·th, that whereas the prisoner had seduced the plaintifP;; wife from
his bed and board, and also taking with her through the connivance
of the said Perrot, certain sums of money, valuable articles etc. In
short to place the whole matter in a nut-shell, he bad seduced nn hon-
est woman to elope with him, and to take from her lawfal husband
certain articles of value and sums of money.
The court put the usual questions through the cleric
1
Prisoner at the bar, are you guilty or not guilty?'
'Not Guilty,' said the little F renchman.
CO:'iFESSION::i OF A 1\tAGNETISER. 45
' As soon as he 'had spoken, I at once recogntzed the mc~meric lec-
turer who had robbed the lawyer at Howard's hotel.
' Brought up at last,' thought I.
The case interested me so much, that I attended the court through
the whole trial. •
It appears that Perrot resorted to New Orleans, as a good field for
his operations, immediately after IC!aving Now York. His ftrst plan
was to commence a series oflectures upon mesmerism, which ht: fol-
lowed up very successfully, as it regarded pecuniary profits. He ha~
become acquainted by some means, in the family of the plaintiff, and
through the agency of the power of magnetism, succeeded in aliena-
ting the affections of his victim, and in accomplishing his purpoEe as
set forth in the indictment. Being pursued, he was caught, and forth-
with brought to justice.
I called upon the plaintiff and related to him that which I have told
to the reader relati,·e to the robber at Howard's hotel, and also told
him that I was ready to swear to the identity of Perrot, and although
1 did not wish to enter into any prosecution, still if it was necessary
to call in question the former character of the prisoner, I was quite
ready and willing to givt' my e,·idence to that point.
Perrot had been enabled throurh his ,,·ealth which was of no mean
character in amount, although obtained in tho vilest manner, to en-
gage the first and best counsel, and in the absenr.e of certain neces-
sary evidence in the case, the plaintiff was very likely to loose the
cause. The wife had not as yet been found, and herein lay an impor-
tant item in the show of evidence.
The case stood thus, when I spoke with the counsel who tha next
day asked permission of the CQurt to introduc<.' evidence showing the
former character of Perrot. The court ruled the matter as admissi-
ble, notwithstanding the learnpd efforts of the opposite counsel to de-
feat it. In fact Perrot had adduced evidence as to his good charac-
ter at the outse!. I was called to the st:tnd.
46 CONFESSIONS OF A l\IAGNETISER.
I stated, as it had occurred, the story and particulars of the rob-
uer.v at New York, and I did not spare the Frenchman iu relating ev-
ery minutia that I thought might show his true character; aud when
I left the stand, I cou~d sec by the expression m the counlt>nances of
the jurors, that they had made up their mind, and that the 1nesmerizer
, would get justice done him.
The coun~el for the plaintiff summed up the evidence to the jury in
behalf ofhis client in a few words, telling them that the case was too
plain to them, for him to go into deLails. Their minds were already
made up, and the evidence admitted.
l n the due cour$e of procedure, the judge pronounced these words:
Jaques Perrot, the jury find you guilty of the several charges al-
!edged against you, and as laid down in the indictment.
And the little disciple ofl\1esmer was sentenced to n lodging in t}te
States prison at the State's expense, for a series of years, and there
he is still serving an apprenticeship to the trade of stone-cutter, in a
stone establi~hment.
Thus ended my acquaintance with Jaques Perrot.

Such i~ thr. wickedness this secret agent is often made the instru•
ment to accomplish- such the class into 11hosC' hands this power of
.:llagnetism has too often fallen. I met not long after with my friend
the lawyer, who had lost his money hy Perrot. I told him the slory
of the l\lesmeriser's comiction, and he declared that he was content
to father his los<~, so that the rascal wn,; brought to justice. I a~ked
him what he now thought oDiesmerism? he replied:
c Its puwtrs arn incontro,·crtbile.'
I undcNood the remark, for the lawyer had experienced a loss of
auout nine hundrel! and fifty dollars.

"ho rend them as a warning to them against imposition in a like case.
I ask :~gain, is not an agent that is so capable of abuse, and who!'e
powers are so perverted, a daugcrous one?
A case strikes me at this very moment of a practitioner in this city,
whose apparent standing in the commuuity should place him abo•c
suspicion, and yet that man is guilty to Otlr certain lmowleoge. It
may have been the peculiar influence of this singular agency that has
seduced him to evil: but evil he is, and it cannot be denied. 1 will
relate one case in which innocent trust has been betrayed, and then I
think I shall have said enough to convince those who have read thue
far this little expose, by one who knows the tricks ofthe art, that .Mag-
netism, or rather the practice of it, should no longer be tolerated, un-
less in certain cases, und then in proper hands.
A young female, a nati1·e of OM of our manufacturing towns in this
vicinity, came to the city, seriously alfccted by a nervous coanplaint,
and by the advice of her friends resolved to adopt a cou1·se of Mes·
meric treatment for her complaint. She accordingly placed herself
111 the hands of a practitioner. The application prored very success-
ful, and in the course of a few weeks she was entirely cured. of her
illness, whether through the agency entirely of .Mesmerism or other-
wise I cannot say. The female \1 as far from home; the operator
knew this; the power of Mesmerism had had the usual effect to cause
her to place all confidence iu him. She was entirely in his power,
nnd the black-hearted villain betrayed her.
What course is there left for her to adopt 7 But one, if ju!'tice is
to be done; and that is, to mal<e public the injustice and the ,·dlainy
of her betrnyer. But in so d 1in~, !\he would have to encounter the
scorn of the world, wh&se finger ofcontempt would be pointed at her.
She rather mourn!> o,·er her misfortune in secret than thus expose
her Oll'n shame.
This is n single cnse, but by no mcnns a solitary one.
I contend that it is the natural consequPnces ofthe practice ofl\fcs·
CO~FESSlONS OF A MAGNETISER. 4~1
merism to lead to results like this :-nd e\·en worse than any I have in-
sta~ced. Its practice must inevitably give life to all the latent tic-
sires in the naturally pasJionatc heart and disposition of man. The
trust and confidence, nyc, and affection too, that it gives birth to, I
h:nc shown by example is fatal to the peace of mind of the 1-ubject,
11nd oftentimes to that of the operator, unless he be of a llnrdened
heart, aud then worse consequences ensure.
The practice of )Jesmeri$tn was carried to such extent in France
at one time, and its deleterious effects became so manifest, that the
further practice of it was forbidden by law, and very justly too, for
even those scarcely beynnd the nge of childhood had assumed 1ts pow-
ers, while yet so youPg ns not to be able to understand its principles,
and thu'> oftentimes serious mischief w;ss done. \Ve may rf.'a~onably
fear the approach of a like trouble with us, and would it not be rrefer-
able to check the e\·il in its infancy? We have already suffic11.'nt ex-
;~.mple of it~ evil consequences.
A few cases of iniquity as connected with the practice ot Mcsmer-
i~m. have l:ltely come before the courts of our common\\'ealth, and
one in p1rticular of recent dnte. ThP. expose ofits pernicioul' prompt-
JUg~ in the cases alluded to, will no doubt hare a beneficial (•ffcct up·
on the mind ofthe community, and it is earnestly to be hop• d that
public opinion will at length put dowu the practice of it, and if necee-
~:~ary, that the law will prohibit its public exhibition.
How many domestic circles have been rendered miserable t1 rough
its agency. How many tender hearts blighted and deseneJ. Ho"
many acts ofdepravity and heinous crimes may be traced to its s<'cret
influence. Have I not then done justice, and justice only, in lllaking
public my opinion, after having at lust a general experienrt' 10 the
practice. after being introduced by the !mowing ones into the ~ccrets
of the art?

prove the positions laid down by us, and thu3 satisfy themse:h <'S as to
