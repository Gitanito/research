  		              		Experience Description   

    I was suffering from gallbladder stones. The pain-attacks were very painful. Many times, I was shouting at the medical staff in the hospital to 'please kill me'. My boyfriend called the ambulance at night again and I was taken to hospital for the umpteenth time. Every few minutes, I was getting a painful attack. A few nurses had to hold me down on the bed because I couldn't stand the pain and was screaming my head off.  I didn't recognize the sounds that were coming from me as I never before was in so much pain, and I've been through so many physical ailments that cause a lot of pain. 
  
  When the pain was coming, I was trying very hard to leave my body because all I wanted was to die.   I imagined myself  as a bubble and trying to squeeze out of my body. With every attack of pain, I was mentally pushing that bubble out more and more.   After about 4 hours, I finally managed to do that. The bubble finally squeezed out and I left. 

  The very first thing that hit me was the noise. I could hear everyone at once who were talking, thinking, and praying. But I was able to understand each one of them, which I found amazing. I didn't have to single them out to know what they were talking or thinking about. I was still aware that I was in hospital. I could hear the nurse across the room talking to one of the patients at the same time as somebody talking on the phone. It was all happening at the same time but it wasn't confusing at all. Then I was transported to another corridor in a different part of the hospital.  I saw a couple walking there and conversing. I remember the man was wearing a yellow shirt. 
  
  I don't recall a sudden shift after that. I just suddenly realized that I understood everything. It was a big 'aha' moment. I could understand physics, math, chemistry, and all the formulas that went with that understanding.   I realised that I didn't have any questions. I suddenly understood my purpose. I saw how everything together made a perfect sense. It's difficult to describe where I was because it was as if I was approaching the universe at a great speed. And at the same time, I was amazed at being able to understand absolutely everything.
  
  Then I got this amazing sense of unity. It felt like the whole universe was in me and I was in the universe. I could feel every person living in me and me living in each of them. Then I had this very strong awareness that I'm in God, God is in me, therefore I'm a part of God. I felt very excited, humbled and in euphoria. And then, suddenly, I was very quickly sucked back into my body as  I  felt a very strong pull downwards.
  
  Immediately afterwards, I started excitedly telling my boyfriend about my experience.  He was in the hospital room with me the whole time. I asked him to go to a corridor with a yellow line. In this hospital, the corridors have coloured lines for each department. I asked him to  find the couple I saw who I described earlier as  the man in a yellow shirt. I told  him to  ask them if they were talking about what I heard. But he didn't do it. Hhe didn't respond at all.  He was just staring at me, not saying a single word. He wasn't expecting me saying all those things and he was just in shock.
  
  I was sent back home in the morning with pain-killers, only to have another gallbladder attack 2 days later...
  
  I was very emotional for the next few days, I went for a walk to the woodlands just few minutes away from my house. When I left my house, my neighbour's dog was barking. I walked towards a windmill which takes over 25 minutes to reach it. When I got there, I could still hear the barking. The whole walk seemed ethreal. I couldn't stand the noise. I could hear every insect, every ant and every bird, munching away, buzzing, and flying. The colours were extraordinary. I've never seen so many shades of fresh green before. I looked at the leaves and I could see the nerves running through the leaves. My vision was so sharp and clear. I was in awe looking at all the details.  I had to cover my ears, although I enjoyed the views, I couldn't stand the noise around me.
  
  I arrived at the pond, sat on the bench, and looked at the swan. I felt myself as having the same life with it, just a different expression of it. I got so emotional that I started crying. I was feeling very grateful for the swan, the trees that surrounded me, and for the pond. I was having a 'wow' moment, feeling a complete oneness with the nature which made me extremely happy. I  couldn't stop crying.  
  

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

  Date NDE Occurred:   	 April 2, 2013  
  
NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        No.           Illness, trauma or other condition not considered life threatening   

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  I saw a couple walking down a corridor in a different part of the hospital. I could hear what they were talking about. I could also hear a nurse giving treatment to somebody else and somebody on the phone.  I lost awareness of my body  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I didn't have to ask myself if I was dreaming, I knew who I was and I knew what I was experiencing. I didn't think about the past or the future. I was in the moment and that was all that mattered. I understood how the universe worked and yet I didn't question how I knew.  It was a normal state of mind, although I was amazed.  
  
At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         After passing through a tunnel of light  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     It seemed that my shift from one place to another was immediate as I don't recall the time in between. I was one place and then in another without actually getting there.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       During the experience I could see very vivid colours that I didn't know existed.  There were  so many shades of colors that were blending in and out.
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      The hearing was the very first thing that hit me. I could hear ALL the people in the world talking and thinking at the same time. It was very noisy, but I could understand each of them individually.  
  
Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, but the facts have not been checked out  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     It wasn't a tunnel made of walls, it felt like I was being shot out of a torpedo and speeding up towards the universe. The closer I got to the end of it, the narrower it got. But at that time, I was thinking that I was going through a tunnel.  
  
Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         No  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Uncertain   I was up in cosmos, the blend of light and colors were amazing, so I guess it was an unearthly light.  

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     Being up there in the universe was mystical and unearthly to me. There was no one else around, but I had a great sense of calm and peace.  
  
What emotions did you feel during the experience?         I was in awe, felt humbled, in euphoria, amazed and just had a huge 'wow' moment, realizing that I understood everything.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe.     I suddenly understood the laws pf physics, math, chemistry, and astronomy. I saw formulas flashing in front of my eyes and I knew what they were. I realized that I had no questions about anything and that all the answers to everything were in me. These answers  included my life purpose and how everything intertwined together. It all  made  perfect sense. I even knew how the universe worked. It is a shame that I can't remember.
  
Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Other Christian     

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     Christian before, spiritualist now.  

What is your religion now?         Other or several faiths   Spiritualist  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     Being a Christian, I would accept to see Jesus and a choir of angels singing 'Hallelujah'. I didn't know that you can get all the knowledge at once. I never have thought of being able to hear everyone talking, thinking and praying at the same time and yet being understand and feel each of them individually. I was taught that God was in us, but never actually felt it the way I felt it during the experience. I also never before experienced such a unity with the universe and everyone else here on earth.  
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I'm not a Christian anymore, I'm spiritual.  I don't think that meditation is a sin anymore. It is scary what I believed before. I'm happy to contact those who passed away and either receive or pass on a message from the other side.  
  
Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I felt I was a part of the universe. At the same time, it felt that the whole universe was in me. We were contained within one another.  It is  difficult to explain. The universe contained me and I contained the universe.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I had an amazing sense of unity with God. I felt God was in me and I was in God. We were inseparable.  
  
Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

  During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   As mentioned before, I knew and understood everything. I realized I didn't have any questions as all the answers were in me.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     I understood my life and my life purpose. Unfortunately, I cannot remember it. Everything made perfect sense and I fully accepted it.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.          I was just aware of it. I didn't have questions about it because I knew there was a life after death.  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     Same as above, I understood why I went through everything in my life. The knowledge left me when I came back though.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     I felt loved by the universe and God in me. I also was the love for the universe and God.  
  
  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     My instincts are stronger and I have a strong connection with animals. I have the ability to pass on messages from those who passed. I have  vivid dreams that always come true. I'm grateful for every experience that comes my way, as I understand now that it is what I planned and agreed to before coming here. I forgot to mention a very important point - I started believing in reincarnation, which for a Christian is strictly a big 'no-no'.  Although, I don't think I am Christian anymore because I rather think of myself as spiritual.   
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes My friends are spiritualists and I can freely share with them what I experience.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   I can see where I was during the experience, but it wasn't anywhere I could compare it to. I also had no idea how much time had passed; I knew I was still me even though I couldn't see or feel my body.  

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  It was a life changing experience for me, even though I didn't realize it fully until I started developing spiritual abilities.  I remember it like it happened yesterday, all the details are still there even though 6 years have passed.  
  
  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I mentioned them before, I'm becoming a medium. I communicated with animals a few times and was able to hear them in my head. I have amazing experiences during meditation.  I can help others with their problems after either meditating or sleeping.  
  
Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?   The amazing sense of unity I felt and having access to the universal knowledge. 

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I told my boyfriend but there was no reaction from him at all. It wasn't until few years later when I met spiritual people, I shared my experience with them. They understand as they have their own experiences, they share with me, so I'm very grateful for having them around me.  
  
  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   As a teenager, I read Raymond Moody's 'Life After Death' that I considered at the time as a forbidden book by the Christian church that  I was a member of. I felt guilty reading it, but it caught my attention. Everyone around me was saying it was the devil's work, so I believed them.  
  
  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I knew it was real because for a few days after the experience I still had very heightened sense of hearing and my vision was very heightened too.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     The experience changed my beliefs and my views of life and death. If it was just a dream, surely it wouldn't have changed me drastically the way it did.  
  
  At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   I left my body few times, but didn't go into space. I was just hovering above the bed seeing myself there. It starts with body vibrations and it's up to me if I give in or not. I sometimes leave 'markers', for example I threw a pillow onto the floor when it started, and when it was still there in the morning, I knew it was real.  
  
  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         It may sound weird, but sometimes when I'm about to go to sleep, I get into the state where I can hear things that I normally wouldn't be able to hear. I don't hear cars on the road when in my house, but when I get into this special state, I hear them. I'm also able to state the car's speed, direction and size. I can hear the kitchen clock that is in the sitting room between my bedroom and the kitchen. I hear  things like that.  
  
Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         NO, everything was thorough.
