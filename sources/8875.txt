  		              		Experience Description   

    Both experiences, one of hell and the other of heaven, happened when I was a child.  
  
  Even as a child, I had done some bad things and was slowly getting deeper into sins.  One day, I was lying on a couch at home and experienced a seizure-like event.  I was foaming at the mouth and passed into another realm.  I felt like I was falling into deep darkness, like a bottomless pit. In this place,  there was nothing good. I was surrounded by  every negative thing  like sorrow, hate, disappointment, and whatever negative emotions you can imagine. Only negative things existed in this realm.  I was falling and falling.  The worst part was that somehow I KNEW there was no bottom.  e I was wishing I would hit the bottom, die and end the misery. Yet, I knew it will go on forever.
  
  I woke up from the 'seizure'.  I had several of these attacks.  There was a lady who came to help mom with housework and she was a believer in God.  She saw me one time,  prayed for me, and commanded the evil to leave me. The seizures  stopped.
  
  Several years later, around age  16 and after doing more bad things, I was on the brink of suicide. I met several Christians who helped me find Christ.  I became a Christian,  attended  church regularly, and was even volunteering.  One day, I was ushering and helping with collection baskets.  I'd been feeling joy and happiness since I became a Christian. But for some reason that day, I was really miserable.  I was wondering if there was an unrepented sin, but I could not find any.  I prayed.  While standing in the church aisle, a tiny laser-like beam came out from the Cross hanging at the front of the church.  The light hit me in the center of the chest.  The Light spread through my body, cell by cell, and where the light was, the joy was restored.  In fact, it was more than Joy.  It was everything good, happy, joyful, peaceful, and loving.  It was all the Good things you can imagine.  The Bible says in heaven, there's no sun, as the Son Himself was so bright that He lights up the whole place.  I knew then it will be worth everything to get to Heaven.  Jesus gives several parables and stories, where He says that heaven is worth selling everything on earth.  I knew it would be true.
  
  I rarely told anyone my experiences, other than a couple of times.  I think it's meant to be for me mainly.  I take to heart the passages in The Bible that say  if they will not believe after hearing the Word of God (the Bible) and they won't believe even if someone dead is raised right in front of their eyes.  There's even an example of when Jesus raised Lazarus and many believed.  Yet, some went to the Pharisees and they conspired to kill Jesus as well as Lazarus instead.

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        No.         The first time (hell) - seizure like.  The second time (heaven) - standing in the church  
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Both pleasant AND distressing  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  I would say I was not passed out but was  not paying attention to other things.  There may have been things happening, but I would not have noticed.  I don't know how long it took but with the Heavenly experience, no one else seems to have noticed anything unusual and life went on as before.  
  
How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        Normal consciousness and alertness   see above  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         Sort of.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     I don't know how long it was.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       same  

  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      same, I think. But it was a long time ago.

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe.     I somehow KNEW the bottomless pit was endless.  Also, I knew what Heaven would be like, although I've only experienced a tiny fraction of it.  
  
Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Protestant   I was brought up in a Christian tradition but not a 'born again' believer at the time of experiencing hell/abyss ('bottomless pit').  I had recently become Christian when I experienced heavenly light.  

  Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes.     Probably more faith.  
  
What is your religion now?         Christian- Protestant     

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I had some knowledge of the Bible but until then, I could not have imagined or believed what hell and heaven were really like.  I remember thinking I will not wish hell on even my worst enemy.  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     How can you live the same after that?  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I knew what the Bible said is true.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Uncertain     I don't remember, but I realized Heaven would be worth everything.  If I could put it in a pill, people will sell everything to get it.  Yet it's not addictive like the earthly drugs.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.     Yes,     I knew Heaven and Hell are real.  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     Yup, see above.  

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I probably treat others better.  

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   There are no words to really adequately describe it.  I did my best to convey what it's like but heaven was way better than I can convey in words.  The opposite is what I can describe for hell.  
  
  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I think the memory does fade but these experiences seem to stay in my memory compared to other events. It is as if it's a gift from God for me to help me in this 'life' on earth.  
  
  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I pray and God answers and sometimes have miraculous healings.  I've experienced other miracles like weather changing and even time going backwards.  
  
  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          I don't know.  
  
Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Few people.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I have no doubt they were real.
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I probably had a glimpse of the true eternal reality.  Our current 'reality' is probably a shadow of what's to come.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         There is nothing I can think of now  
  
  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Good questions. Though the questionnaire is a bit tiring but some questions jogged my memory.
