as an additional source of revenue to
the state. But when I consider the de-
light with which stories of apparitions
are received' by persoos o£ all ages, and
of the most various kinds of knowledge
'+ and ability, I cannot help feeling some
degree of complacency, in offering to
tftct: mnarkers and rraders of such stories,
i \~lew. of the suliect, which may ex-
tend their enjoyment far beyond its for• .
mer limits. It has given me .paint() see
the most fearful and ghast~y commence-
ments of a tale .of horror reduced .to
, _mere common events, at the winding up
of thlr=book. I have looked, also, with
much compassion, on the pitiful instru- ·
ments of sliding pannels, trap-doors, -~QC/r·

belief in supcrnatur~l occurrences. So
.haCkneyed, so exhausted had _all arti-
ficial methods ·of terror become, that
one original genius was compelled to
convert a mail-coach, with its lighted
lamps, into an apparition•
. Now I freely offer, to the manufac-
turers of ghosts,. the privilege of raising
them, in as great numbers, and in as
horrible a g~ as they may think fit,
without offending against true philo&o-
p~y, and even without violatin·g proba-
bility. The highest flights of impa-
tion may now be indulged, on this
subject, although no loop-hole should
be l~ft ·for mortifying explanations, and
for those modifications of terror, which
completely baulk the reader's curiosity,
and disgust him with a second reading.

Another great convenience will .be found
in ' my system; apparitions may ·.be :
evoked, in open da~at noon, if the ·
case should be urgent, in the midst of a
field, on the surface of water, or in the .
glare of a' patent-lamp, quite as easily,
as in the 'darkness of chaos or old night.'.
Nay, a person rightly prepared may see
ghost&, while seated comfo~ab~y by his
library-fire, in as much- perfection, as"
amidst broken tombs, nodding ruins, and
awe-inspiring ivy. To-thote unfortunate
persons, who feel a real dread of appa•
ritions, I hope ro offer considerations·
whic;h will quiet their fears, and will.
even convert the horrors of solitude lnto
a source of rational amusement. .But:I ·

ceive that the best supported stories of
,apP,aritions .may be ·completely account-

To render this inqui.ry.·more perspicu-
ous, I shall consider,
_I. The general law of the system,
to which the origin of the spectxal im-
pressiops may be r~ferred:
II. The pro?f of the existence of
morbid impressions o( this nature, with-
out any sensible external ~gency:
Til. The application of these prin-
ciples to the best-authenticated examples
of apparitions. ·

It is a well-known 'law of the human

chases illuminated manuscripts, and &rly
editions on vellum, for _sums so trifling,
that he cannot conceal his joy from the
imagirntry vender. -
Dr. R. Drirwin seems to· believe, that
it is from habit only, and want of atten-
tion, that we ·do not see the remains of
former impressions, or the muactt ooli.J
tantes, on all objects.• Probably, this
is an instance, in which the error of
external sensation is corrected by experi~
ence, like the deceptions of perspective,
which are undoubtedly strong in -our
childhood, an~ are only detected by
tepeated observation.
" After having looked," says Dr. Dar-
•• wiri, " long at the meridian sun, in
" making some of the preceding experi~
•-
• ments, till the disk faded into a pale
~· blue, I frequently observed a bright
" blue spectrum of the sun -1n other

" objects all the next and the succeeding
"day, which constantly occurred when
" I attended to it, and frequently when
'-'I did not atterid to it. When I dosed
" and -covered my eyes, this appeared
,__of a. dull yellow ; and at other.times
" mixed with the·colours of other objects
" on which it was thrown." •
It is scarcely necessary to mention-the
well-known-experiment of giving a rola"!
tory motion to a piece of burning woad,
the effect of which is to exhibit a;com..:
plete _
fiery circle to the eye.
- To this principle of a renewal of
impressions formerJy made by ditfercnt
objects, belongs the idle amusement of
tracing landscapes, and pictures of vari...
ous composition, in the discoloured spots-
of an old wall. This may be truly called·
a waking dream, as it is composed of
the shreds and patches of past -sensations:;~
yet there are, perhaps, few persons who•

have not.occa.Sionally derived entertain-
-meat from it. . It is probably on the
same principle, ·that we are to account
for the appearances of armies marching,
in desart and inaccessible places, which
are sometimes beheld by the inhabitants
of t!Je vallies, in mountainoll'S regions.
The accidents of light and shade, and
the interposition of partial fogs, or clouds,
produceihe ~me effect on the eye, as
the.discoloured patches .of the wall; and
. the rolling..of the mis~ adds motion to·the
spectral images.
In ·like .manner, recollected images
are attributed to .the. moving lights, in
the splendid exhibitions of the Aurora
Borealis. The Icelander beholds in them
Jhe spirits of his ancestors ; • and the
vulgar discern encountering armies, and
torrents of blood, in the.lambent meteors
of a winter-sky.·. The humble diversion

The giant was ·.seen to occupy the
· suinmit of .-'3'.·. mountain, at certain
periods,· to :~he ·inexpressible amaze-
: ment of the inhabitants of the valley,
and of travellers: After many years of
alarm and wonder, a passenge1; while
he \Vas·contemplating the dreadful·appa-
rition, was obliged to raise his · hand
quic~ly to his head, to secure hi~ hat
·from being carried away, by a .gtJst of
covered by thick £l~uds. J\~c~nding ali th~t m~ment
the gra~ite rocks call~d the. Tempel$kanzel, there
appeared before DJe, though at a gru,t distanc~. to·

the gigantic figure of a man, a~ if ata~ding Qn a large

wind. _The giant immediately perform-
ed a similar motion ; when the travcller
bowed, the giant bowed in return ;_ and
after various experiments, it was ascer-
tained, that the portentous appearance
was nothing more than the shadow of
the traveller, reflected from a dense
white cloud, opposed to the sun.
I remember to have heard, many
years ago, .a relation ·of a similar nature,
oh the Broken confined the prospect. In these
douds, soon after the rising of the sun, I saw my own
shadttw, of a monstrous size, move itself for a couple
·of seconds in clouds, and the phenomenon disappeared,
Itis impo$sible to see this phenomenon, except \Vhen
the sun is at such an altitude as to throw his rays upon
the body in a horizontal direction; for, if he is higher,
the shadow is thrown rather under the body than be-
fore it. In the month ·of September last year, as I
was making a tour through the Hari with a very
agreeable party, and ascended the Broken, I found an
· excellent account, and explanation of this pheno.-
menon, as seen by M. Haue on the 2Srd of.May
1797, in his diary of an excursion to that mountain.
I shall therefore take the liberty of transcribing it. ·

from a gentleman, who underwent the
deception.
He was benighted, while travelling
alone, in a remote part of the highlands
of Scotland, and was compelled to ask
shelter for the ~vening, at_a small, lonely
hut. When he was to be conducted to
his bed-room, the landlady observed,
with .mysterious reluctance, that he
would find the window very insecure.
•• After having been here for the thirtieth time,"
says M. Haue, '' and, besides other· objects of my
attention, having procured information respecting the
above-mentiont~d atmosJ>heric phenomt>non; I was a~
length so fortunate as to have ~he pleasure of seeing it.;
and perhaps my description may afford satisfaction to
others who visit the Broken through curiosity. The
sun rose about four o'clock, and the atmosphere being
quite serene towards the east, his rays could pass. with-
out any obstruction over the Heinnichshohe• In the
south west, however, towards the Achtermaunshohe,
a brisk west wind ,carried before it their transparent
vapours, which were not yet condensed into thick
heavy clouds. About a quarter past four I went to•. -
wards the inn, and looked round to see whether the

atmosphere would permit me to have a free prospect

On eiamination, part of the wall ap-
peared to hav_e been broken dowu, to
enlarge the opening. After some en-·
quiry, he was told, that a pedlar, who
had lodged ·in the room a short time·
before, had committed suicide, and was
found hanging beh1nd the door, in tbe
mornmg. According to the superstition
of the country, it was deemed improper
to remove the body thr.ough the door of
the house; and to convey it thro-ugh
to the south lrest; when I observed_. at a very great
. . · distance towat:ds tbe Achtermaunghobe. a ·human
figure of a monstrous size. A violent gust of wind
ha...ing almost carried away my hat, I clapped iny
hand to it b.f moving my arm towards my head, and
t~e colossal figure did the same. The pleasure which
I felt on t~is discovery .can hardly .be described; for
I had already .walked many a weary step ia the hope
Qf seeing this shadowy image without being able tQ
satisfy my curiosity. I immediate~y made another
movement by .bending my body, and the colossal
fig~re before me repeated it. I waa desirous of doing.
the same thing once more, but my colossus had ·
, vanished. I remained in the same position, waiting

removing part of the wall. Some hints
were dropped, that the room had been· .
subsequently haunted by the poor man's
spirit.
My friend laid his arms, properly pre-
pared against intrusion of any kind, by
the bed-side, and retired to rest, not
without some degree of apprehemion.
He was visited, in a dream, by a fright..
i paid my respects to it a second time and it did the
same to me. 1 then called the landlord of the Broken;
and having both. taken the same position which I had
taken alone, we looked toward the Achtermaun11hohe,.
but saw nothing. We had not, however, stood long,·
when ·two such colossal figures were for~d over the
above eminence, which repeated our compliment by
bending their bodies as we did; after which they·
vanished. We retained our position; kept our eyes
fixed upon the same spot, and in a little the two
figures again stood before us, and were jQined by a
third. Every movement that we made by bt:nding our.
bodies, these figures imitated-but with this difference,
that the phenomenon was sometimes wea~ an.d faint;

When the brain is partially irritated, ·
the ·patient fancies that he sees spider.;
crnwling over his bed-clothes, or person;·
_or beholds·them covering the roof and
walls of his room. If the disease in-
c~eases, he imagines that .persons who
are dead, or absent, flit round hi5 bed ;
that animals croud into his apartment,· .
and that all these apparitions speak to
him. The§e impressions take place,
even while he is convinced ()f their
&llacy. All this occurs sometimes,
~itheut any degree of delirium.
I had occasion to see a young married
woman, whose first in4ication of illness
was a spectral delusion. She told me,
tliat hef apartment appeared suddenly
· tc{·be filled ·with devils, and that her
terror impelled her to ·qui( the house
witn· great·precipitation, · ':Vhen she was
br.Ought back;· she saw· the whole stair-
case occupied by' diabolical fbrms, and .
was in agonies of fear for ~veral days.

After this :first impression wore ~ft she
heard· a voice tempting. her . to seif-
destruction, .and prohibiting her fr9m
all exercises of piety. Such was the
account given by her, when ~he was
sensible of the delusion, yet unable to
resist the horror ofthe impression. When
she was nearly recovered, I had the
curiosity to question her, as I have
interrogated others, respecting the· forms
of the demons \\ith which they had
·been alarmed; but I never could obtain
any othel" account, than that they were
s~all, very much deformed, and had
horns and claws, like the imps of our.
·terrific modern romances.
I have been forced to listen with
much gravity, to a man partially insane,
who assured me thanhe devil was lodged -
in his side, and that I should percei,vc
him thumping and fluttering there, in
~ manner which would perfectly con-
l'ince me of his presJ!nce.

Another lunatic believed that he had

him in his stomach~ He resisted the

he should set the foul fiend at liberty.
I overcame his resolution, however, by
administering an emetic in his food.

Such was the force of this memorable
fit of national insanity, during which
torrents of innocent blood were shed, by
the misguided judge_s and juries, under
the impre$sion that they were actually
invaded by a_legion of devil&; the part
of which was really performed by them-

nine hundred criminals to the stake._
· His book is one of the most remarkable
productions of credulity; for the mon-
strous absurdities which. it contains are
supported by juridical proofs, most of
which evidently proceeded from spectral

torted by torture.
My ·edition of this work, which is
become very rare, -was printed by Vin-
·centi, at- Lyons,,in 1595. It is entitled,
DlEMONOLATREIA. The trials appear to
have begun in 1583. Mr. Remy seems
to have felt great anxiety to ascertain the
exact features and dress of the demons,
with whom many of the persons sup-
posed themselves to be familiar. Yet
nothing transpired, in his examinations,
which varied from the r usual figures
exhibited by the gross sculptures and
paintings of the middle age. They--are

" the consequence of a diseased state of
" the nerves and an irregular circulation
" of the blood."
" It being a matter of considerable im-
" portance that an incident of this nature
" should be observed with the strictest at-
" tention, and related, together with all
'' collateral circu~?stances, with the most
" conscientious fidelity, I shall not omit
" any thing of which I retain a clear
11 recollection. The truth of what'I am
" going to advance will not require a far-

"my physician and was daily informed
'' by me of every trifling occurrence and _
" change that happened, is still living,
"and.wilJ, ~y all who know him, be most
" readily admitted as an unobjectionable
11 witness. During the ten latter months of
" the year 1790, I had experienced seve-

" I had, in 1783, been suddenly taken
".with a violent vertigo, which my phy·

" on by a sedentary lite and a continual

"was successfully removed by means of
"a more regular and strict diet; particu-

" which had most powerfully affected my
11 moral feeling, to be capable ofattending

" sent immediately for a physician, the
"phantasm_continued about eight mi-

" half an hour; the physician ascribed
" the apparition.to a violent mental (!mo-
,, tion, and hoped that there would.be no
f' return, but the violent agitation of my

" appeared. I was by myself when this

This is one of the extreme cases of
delusion, which a man of strong natural
judgment has ventured to record of him-
self. Cardan, who fancied himself vi-
sited by supernatural impulses, never
produced so marvell.ous a story.
Cardan, however, describes himself as
amused, in l~is youth, with recollected
images, similar to those which I haye
described, in the first chapter. Before
he left his bed, in the morning, he saw
-~ succession of figures, compos~d of
brazen rings, like lirlks of mail, (though
he hap never seen mail-armour at that
time,) moving, in a circular direction,
upwards, from right to left, till they
disappeared. Castles, houies, anifi?.als,
trees, men in different dresses; trum-
peters, appearing 'to blo\v their trumpets,
though no sound ~as heard ; soldiers,

this heroine, published ~y Denys Gode-

and elevation of mind. When she in-
duced Charles VII. to the bold attempt
.of procuring his inauguration at Rheims;
she described the celestial voice as having
said to her, while she was engaged in
prayer, Fille, va, va, je seray a ton aydt,

· of ' Second-Sight.' Much has been w~it­
ten on this subject ; .I shall therefore
only mention two instances, which will
prove that the spectral 'impressions cer-
tainly take place; of their prophetic
nature, there may be different opinions.
'
A gentleman connected with my fa-
mily, an officer in the army, and cer-
tainly addicted· to no SUpt!rstition, was
_ quartered, early in life, in the middle
of the last century, near the castle of a
'gentleman in the -North of Scotland,
who was supposed to possess the Second-
Sight. Strange rumours were afloat, re-
-
specting the old chieftain. He had
spoken to an apparition, which ran
~ong the battlements of tR.e house, and
had never been chearful afterwards. His
pl'ophetic visions excited surprize, even
in ----that region of credulity; and his
retired habits favoured the popular opi-
nion. My friend assured· me, that one
day, while he was reading a play to the
\
THEORY OF APPARlTIONS. 65
ladies ~r the family, the chief, who had
been walking across the· room, stopped
suddenly, and assumed . the look of a
Ster. He rang the bell, and ordered
the groom to saddle a horse; to proceed
immediately to a seat'in the neighbour-
hood, and to inquire after the health of
Lady--; if the account was favour- ·
able, he then directed him to call at
another castle, to ask after another lady
whom he named,
The reader immediately closed his
book, and declared that he would not
proceed till these abrupt orders were
explain~d, as he was confident that they
were produced by the Second-Sight.
The chief was very unwilling to explain
himself; but at length he owned, that
the door had appeared to open, and that
a little woman, without a head, had
I
entered the room ; that the apparition
indicated the sudden death of some per-
son of his acquaintance; and the only
two persons -who lfesemhled the figure.,
were tlH~se -ladies, after whose ·healtla· he
. had sent !to .inquire.
-A few :Sours afterwards, the servant
returned; with an account that one of
the ladies had died ·of an apoplectic tit,

At another time, the chief was con-
fined to his bed, by indisposition, and
my friend was reading to him, in a
stormy ·:winter-night, wh-ile the .fishing-
boat, belonging to the castle, was-at sea.
The old _gentleman repea~edly ex-pressed
much anx.i.ety respecting his people; and
at last exclaimed, my boat is lost! The

MAltTIN, wh.o has given avery parti-

was .troubled, during four or five years,
.with •the constant appearanceof her own
Una.ge .before ·her, the back ~eing turned
.towards her. No event was connected '
with this ipectral impression.
But one of the most remarkable Seers
on record, was joHN BEAUMONT, who
published a ' treatise of spirits, appari-
tions, witchcrafts, and other magical
practices,' in T705. He appears to have
been a man of a hypochondriacal dispo-
. sition, with a considerable degree of
reading, but with a strong bias t~ credu-
lity. His collections of stories are enter-
taining; but my business is with his

·ha,·e exchanged the narratives of Beau- ·
mont's reveries, for those of Tasso !
To this class of morbid perceptions,
belong also the visions of Christopher
Kotter, and Drabicius, which made a
considerable noise in the seventeenth
century. They wet·e published by Co-
menius, aided .by very ghostly engrav-
ings, under the title of I Lmt eTenebris!
I must refer to Bayle, for many curious
observations respecting the tendency of
these prophetic rhapsodies : my business
is only with th~ faculty of spectral re-
presentation.
For this reason, I shall not notice
Drabicius. As a man of superior infGr-
mation, he might be suspected of politic
views, in his pretended visions : but
there· 'can be no doubt that Kotter was
sincere in his enthusiasm, and was as
muc~ a Seer as any second-sighted pro-
phet of the Hebrides." ·

Kotter•s first vision was detailed by
him, on oath, before the magistrates of
Sprottaw, in ·1619. While he was tra•-
velling on foot, in open day-light, in
June · 1616, a man appeared to him,
who ordered him to inform the civil and
ecclesiastical authorities, that great ~viis
were impending over Germany, for the
punishment of the sins of the people;
after which · he vanisl:ted. The . sa~e
apparition met him at different times,
and compelled him at length, by threats,
~o make this public declara;tiQn; .
After this, his visions assumed a! ~.ore

IN medicine, we have fine names, at
least, for every &pecies of disease. . The ·
peculiar disorder, which I have endea-
voured to elucidate, is tem1ed generally

impressions, from the wandering mote
before the eye, to the tremendous spec•
tre, · which is equally destitute of exist-
ence.

It is unnecessary to my purpose, to
pursue the subdivisions of ·this affection,
which have been traced by nosologists.
I shall only mention one extreme spe-
cies, called the Lycanthropia, in which
the patient imagines himself to have
become a wolf, abandons society, and
takes refuge in the woods•. These im-
pressions have no doubt been produced,
or strengthened by narcotic potions, of
byoscy~mus, datura stramonium, and
Qther deleterious infusions, either igno-
rantly taken, or maliciously adminis-
tered.
But we may well be surprized to find,
that impressions of this kind are regis-
ter~ . under the title of experimental
philosophy. .Dr. Garmann, • in his
chapter on the ghosts of the deac4 in-
forms us, that 41 when human salt,

"of a man, was placed· in a water-dish,
(I and covered with another plate, there
" appeared next morning, in the ·mass,
" figures of men fixed to the cross."
Another philosopher relates, that, ~hen
fresh earth from a church-yard was put
into an oblong .plate, after the perform-
3nce of certain ceremonies, a thousand·
spectres were visible in it.
During ·the sixteenth century, prepa-
rations from the human skull were fa-
vourite remedies : the moss which was
found on skulls long-interred, and the
bones · reduced to powder, were often
prescribed. In a very respectable work,
. WEPFER~s Histori£ Apopleclicorum, there
is a dissertat~<m ·on this subject, by Dr.
Emanuel"Krenig,•· in which he asserts,
that on those nights when the human
skull was· pounded in the apothecary's

house, the family was alarmed by un-
usual noises, by clappings of the ·doors
and windews, by groans, and other
indications that the spirits of the dead
were abroad. .
I ha,·e never found that any effects of
this kind were attributed to the MUMIA,
a favourite remedy of the same period:
that is, the flesh of mummies, which
were imported from Alexandria, and
which was swallowed in the form of
pills or boluses, by the noble and rich,
in Europe. 'Fhe medical writings of that
time are full of accounts of.this horrible
and useless practice, which was at length
discontinued, when 'it was found that
the Alexandrians, instead of diSinterring _
the embalmed mummies of the ancient
Egyptians, contented themselves with
exporting the putrid carcases of Jews, ·
to which theyhaq easier access.•

In this manne1· was anthropophagy
sanctioned by physicians, even as late as
the reign of Louis XIV. while some
writers affected to doubt, whether the
practice had ever existed.
§ Ill.
From the. principles- which l have
established, the reader will easily proceed
' with me, to ac,count for the most im-
posing relations of apparitions.
I have shewn thatamorbid disposition
of the brain· is capable of producing
spectral impressions, without any exter-
nal prototypes. The religion of the
ancients, ·which peopled all parts of
nature with deities of different rank5,
exposed them, in a peculiar manner, ·
to delusions of the imagination ; and I
·have had occasion, i~. another essay,•

to mention the· influence which the doc-
trines of Plato have exerted~ in this
resoect, even .since the establishment of
6
ohrislianity. From recalling images by
an art of memory, the transition is direct
..,.. beholding spectral objects, which
. . ' . .
have been floating in .the imagination.
Yet, even in the most frantic assemblage
• o(. this n~e, no novelty appears. T.he
spectre may be larger or smaller; it may
be.compgunded of the parts of dUferent
animals/; ~ut it,:is always framed from
the recollection .of familiar, though d~
ebrdantimages•
The simple renewal of the impressions
of form or voice, ~ the case of parti-
cular friends, is the most obvious, and
most forcible of these recollections. .. Of
this kind, seems to have been the cele-
'brated apparition of Ficinus, to Michael
Mercato, mentioned by Barotlius.

My observations on this subject may
'
be strengthened, by observing the great
prevalence of spectral delusions, during
the inter..regnum, in this country, after
the civil war, in 16+9. The melancholic
tendency of the rigid puritans of that
period ; their occupancy of.old family
1eats, forn'iea·ly the residence of hospita:.

the arts of confederacy. This point, I
trust, is now decided.
An apparition which made some
noise, about the beginning ?f tJle last ·
century, that of DESFONTAINES, seems
to have originated in a fit of deliquium,
connected strongly with the recollection
of a friend.
··n was published in the Journal de
Trevour, in 1726, and its outline is as
follows.
Mr. Bezuel, when a school-boy of 15,
in 1695, c~ntracte~ an intimacy with a
y(n~nger boy, named Deifontaines. After
talki.qg together of the compacts which
hav~ been often made ·between friends,
t~at in case of death, the spirit of the
deceased should revisit the survivor., they
agre~.~ to form such a compact together,
and .they signed it, respectively, with
their blood, in 1696. Soon after this
THEORY OF APPARITIONS: 119
.transaction, they were separated, · by
Desfontaint!s' removal to Caen.
li"l-iuly, 1697, Bezuel, while amusing
himself in hay-making, near a friend's
house, was seized with a fainting fit,
after which he·had a bad night. Not-
withst_
anding this attack, he returned to
the meadow next day, where he again
underwent a deliquium. He again slept
ill. · On- the succeeding day, while he
was observing the man laying up the
hay, he had a still more severe attack.
" I fell into a swoon : llm.t. my senses:
If one of -the footmen perceived it, and
•• called out 'for help. They reco\'ered

" but I knew him not.
"They helped me tq go down the

"cause I saw Desfontaines my school-

" had again a fainting fit : my head got
" between two steps, and· I ~gain lost
' 4 my senses. They let me down, and
of set me .upon a large beam, which
"served for a seat in the great Place de
" Capucins. I sat upon it, and then I
" no longer saw Mr. de Sortoville, nor
." his S<"rvant_s, though they were present.
" And perceiving Desfontaintl near the
" foot of the ladder, who made me- a
" aign to come to him, I went back
" upon my seat, as it were to make
"rQom- for him; and those who saw
" me, and whom I did not see, though

that Rulmore 0'Rely the then sheriff,
had a hand in commanding the murder
of those said persons, for that he saw
him write ·two notes which he Sent to

and those persons who were present also
affirmed, that the bodies of those thirty
persons drowned did not appear upon

there can be no d6ubt. The actoL:s in
such bloody scenes are liable to tre--

rendered horrible by the repetition of
the shrieks and .cries which had assailed ·

The appearance of bodies, sitting up-
right in .tht~ water, was ·no deception;,
though it contributed by its horror, to
the illusions of the .ear. This terrific
visitation has occasioned much alarm,
under similar · ci,rcumstances, even in
modern tiin:es. We are told, that after

But there is ghostly authority for the
,division of a goblin, equa:l to· most of
Glanville's histories, though I cannot
now recover, the names of the parties.
The relation came to ' me, however,
from a friend of one ofthe~eers.
Two elderly ladies, resided, each in
her ancient castle, adjoining to the other,
·near the borders of Scotland. While
they were · beguiling ·a tedious winter
evening, with accounts of their domestic
policy, the:COnversation insensibly turnt:d
on the c;ubject of their household.ghosts:
for at that time, every venerable old
mansion had an established resident of
that nature, who was as well known as
the family-crest.
' Every evening, said one of the
• Sybils, I perceive the bust of a man,
' in one of the rooms, which is distinctly
,. visible, down to the girdle. ·

-·.;' And we,' cried the other dame,
~have the rest of h~s person .in our
'-castle, which perambulates the house
' every night; till this moment, I could
4 not imagine hoiv the heai and shoulders
' of the figure_ were disposed of.'.
I have thus presented to the rec1der,
those facts which have afforded, to my
own mind, a -satisfactory explanation of
such relations of spectra-l appearances, as
-cannot be refused credit, without re-
moving all the limits and!!t!Upports of
human testimony. To disqualify the
senses, or the veracity -of those. who
witness .unusual appearances, is the ut-
most tyranny of prejudice. Yet, who,
till within the last fifteen years, would
have dared to assert that stones fell from
·the clouds? Livy had regularly re-
corded such events, and . was-ridiculed
for supplying those most CW'ious facts,
which must otherwise have been lost. tQ
natural history,
In like tinanner, I concei.ve·that -the
unaffected accounts of spectllll visions
should engage the attention of the phr.
losopher, as well as of ~he physiciall'.
Instead of I"e!IRFding these ·stories w~th
the horror of the vulgar, ,pr the disdain
of the sceptic, we should examine them
accurately, and should ascertain. their
exact relation to the state of the. brain,
and of the external senses.
The terror ofnocturnal illusions; wouhi ·
thus be dissipated, to the infinite .rel:ief
of many wretched creatures; am. the
appearance of a ghostwould be.regarde6
in its true lightr,t as a symptom.0f·bodiLy
distemper, and of ·little more conS&
qwmce than the head-ach and shivering
attending a common catarrh.

There is reason: to· believe,. that many
persens sutfe11 silently, fr(j)m th-ese imag&
nary visitations, who are deterred from
divulging ·their distresses, by the~ ridac•

with which complaints of this nature are
commonly treated. When the proper
distinction is established, admitting the
reality of the impression, but explaining
its production in the mind alone, all
difficulties of this kincl.may be remo.Jed,
and the apprehensions of the vmonary
may be readily quieted.
Lastly, by the key which I have
furnished, the reader of history is re-
leased from the embarrassment of reject-
. ing evidence, ·in some of the plaine~t
narratives~ or of experiencing un~asy
doubts, when the solution might be ren-
.dered perfectly simple.
