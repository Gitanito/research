 Continues the volume numbering of Human Faculty.  Rocine (1855-1943), who prefixed his name with "Doctor" because he had a Ph.D. in Mental Science from the Haddock & Holt Institute in San Francisco, on which see Human Nature (San Francisco), was born in Sweden and after the turn of the century began to publish  in Chicago a series of books on "Mind-Training," "Heads, Faces, types, Races," "Syngesis" (on the sexual center in the brain), etc.  As with many of his contemporaries, sex ("Conservation of Sex-Vitality") played a prominent role in Rocine's ideas on mental training and development, but Rocine also emphasized  and claimed to be able to distinguish "types" ("calcium men," "sulpher type," etc.) of humans, a judgment that he then coupled with ingestion of "food that contains the elements of life" for each type.  The journal is the continuation of the physiognomist and character-reader L.A. Vaught's Human Faculty, which Rocine took over when he moved in with Vaught's widow, Emily, after Vaught  died in May 1903.  The couple ran the Human Science School (V.G. Lundquist, Pres.) which offered the degree of Doctor of Human and Divine Science.  This was an endeavor set up by Rocine under his original name; apparently the Lundquist brand had residual value and could not be abandoned.  Character reading was a natural development of physiognomy and phrenology and, in its passage through the self-development / self-improvement side of New Thought, led in turn to  "scientific" character analysis, claimed expertise in efficiency, and modern "Human Resources" departments.  Advertised in Betiero's Oriental Mysteries, 1903 ("Deals with Mental Science in a surprisingly way.  Positively practical.  Highly illustrated");  in Henry Edward Lane, Diagnosis of the Eye (1904)("Something new.  More than up-to-date.  Away in ADVANCE of others"); in Soundview, December 1906 ("best journal on character reading and self-development");  and  in Human Nature, March 1905, bundled with Prof. Lundquist's correspondence course in Scientific Character Reading, through the Human Science School of Chicago.  Rocine went on to write for Occult Digest, Mystic world, etc., and to promote his Lessons on "Mind Training."  Smithsonian Institution; Palmer College of Chiropractic; LOC.
