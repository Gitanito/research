  		      2384.        Ross D Probable NDE       4/18/2008.      Probable NDE 31783.       From Australia      I knew I was flying through space at a terrifying speed. It seemed to go on for ages. There was a lot of other stuff to see on the way but it is a bit hazy now after all these years. Anyway, I turned up at this really bright bush garden type of place and I hadn't felt that good in my life before or since. Next thing my granddad turns up and told me I had to go back I said no way in the world am I going back there, you've got to be joking then two other blokes turn up and they had a sort of talk about it (they weren't talking it was like mental telepathy, you only had to think it).  
   Severely ill with osteomyelitis. In garden type of place. Grandfather appears. Was told he needed to go back.   

    2383.        Eugene W NDE       9/27/2010.      NDE 4711.             Then I saw her, my Nana. She calmly stepped into view from the fog.  She said, 'YOU are NOT supposed to be here!' I remember being happy to see her, but sad that she was sending me away. I didn't understand why. She said, 'Chipper, you have 2 sons to raise, and if you don't go back they will not be right, they will be bad boys,' I said, but Nana, I have only ONE son at home, she said 'No, you have two!' (Genie was pregnant, but I didn't know then)  
   NDE from motorcycle accident.  Interesting that severe brain trauma from the accident delayed the memory of the NDE for a couple of months.   

    2382.        Sheba M NDE       9/27/2010.      NDE 4707.       From Australia.      The first thing I see is an endless field/meadow of the most beautiful flowers. I told myself 'Oh this is the Garden of Eden.' (In my mind, there was no doubt about this.) Then right next to the flowers was a huge pipe/tunnel, kind of reminded me of an underground drain only massive. I immediately went into the tunnel - not walking - just floating upright and I could hear a 'whooshy sound'. I again told myself 'Oh, this is the tunnel, I must be dying.' I went further in and then in the far distance I saw the light.  
   NDE from anaphylactic shock.   

    2381.        Michele NDE       9/27/2010.      NDE 4705.             As I looked to my right, in a higher plane I saw a city. It was not in clouds but higher. The cathedrals were in Mideast fashion with a light blue dome with gold circling the top. They were numerous. I was aware of the presence in soul of my grandmother, grandfather, best friend. They were joyful, and unlimited in their understanding of my presence. They were happy to see me - acknowledged my presence from a distance in the city of domes. I wanted to see their bodies, as I knew them. However, I knew their soul and recognized them through their light's expression. There were objects of light passing in between, fleeting, quickly, they thought and they were.  
   NDE from pregnancy complications and burst appendix.   

    2380.        Deborah K NDE       9/27/2010.      NDE 4703.             I was enveloped in love, complete and unconditional love and compassion, with a gentleness I had never felt before in my life. I felt cushioned and cradled as if I was the most precious of children. After observing the scene below, I realized there was a Presence with me, a very powerful but totally loving Being. I did not see anyone, but knew He was there even though I did not know for sure who it was. It was at this time I was given a choice, not through words, but telepathically, just KNOWING. I could continue in this bliss and come back Home, across some sort of barrier I could sense was very close by, or I could return to my body, with all its pain and uncertain future. Oh, how I wanted to stay in that bliss! Although the choice was the epitome of compassion and loving, I nearly scoffed at its cruelty. 'Thanks a lot,' I said sarcastically to myself.  
   NDE from car accident. Evidential OBE; Came back for her children.   

    2379.        Annette W Probable NDE       9/26/2010.      Probable NDE 4699.       From Canada.      I was floating in the air over my bed. My father was beside the bed in a chair, his elbows resting on his knees, chin resting in his hands. He had on an off-white long-sleeved kind of dress shirt like they wore in the seventies and somehow I knew that he was praying for me. I remember trying to make sense of the bars and ropes that were attached to me. My right leg was up in the air and a cast on my left. I remember thinking that I was looking down at me, 'Strange,' I thought, 'why don't I care?' I remember feeling intense love for my father and then I was somewhere else.  
   Probable NDE from auto accident.   

    2378.        Mary J NDE       9/26/2010.      NDE 4697.             Then I woke up and I was in a tunnel of clouds going round and round and a brilliant bright light at the top. I felt a peace and joy I have never felt before. There were others there with me. I looked up and saw someone dressed all in white almost floating down. I saw his face and it was my brother, Billy, who had died in 1990. He smiled at me, reached down, and took my hands and I smiled back at him. He looked like he did when he was in his mid-twenties. We started going up towards the bright light, like we were just floating up. I saw my three granddaughter's heads, as if they just stuck their heads inside the tunnel and they were saying 'Nana, don't go,' their voices sounded distorted, as if they were far, far away, but I wanted to keep going and we did.  
   NDE from surgery complications.   

    2377.        Eric S NDE       9/26/2010.      NDE 4696.             During this period was the 'life review' (I use this term very loosely). There was no judgment. With increased awareness, I simply remembered all of my life. I let go of all the things I loved, all the people I loved. There was no regret. It struck me as remarkable that the most painful moments of my life were the ones I most treasured when the pain was gone. There's a reason for this too. And no, I still don't remember.  
   NDE from criminal attack.   

    2376.        Monique F NDE       9/26/2010.      NDE 4694.             I saw my whole life flash before my eyes like pictures in a spinning wheel from left to right it was so fast, starting from the present going back to the past. I kept seeing Jason's (my boyfriend) face, and I was saying his name. Later mom told me I was screaming his name at the top of my lungs several times. Then I stopped breathing, my eyes rolled up in my head and she gave me CPR. Then it disappeared, and I saw what I believe was God's outline, with a bright light behind him. I truly believe I saw him, I asked him not to take me repeatedly, and that I was going to do better with my life if he would give me another chance.  
   Passed out from not being able to breathe.   

    2375.        Lance H Probable NDE       9/26/2010.      Probable NDE 4693.             I faintly remember starting to panic, but then the area began to get really bright almost animated in a sense. I remember staring at some seaweed that was swaying in front of me and being at ease with my surroundings. The scared feeling went away when I felt like I was no longer alone down there - it was surreal I guess. I didn't exactly SEE a presence, but I DEFINITELY FELT IT. It also felt like time slowed and I was in my own kind of heaven.  
   Child drowning Probable NDE.   

    2374.        Lillian H Probable NDE       9/26/2010.      Probable NDE 4685.             . . .beautiful lawns of green and pink, trees of petals falling like snow, diamond and gold like homes in a distance. Large rock by the entrance with the man in a beard on it. Flowing blue gown of the lady who seemed to float not walk to me. Her eyes were large and I did not see her mouth move.  
   Probable NDE from brain aneurysms.   

    2373.        Sam A NDE       9/26/2010.      NDE 4683.             I was flying across my Grandfather's property and noticed how beautiful everything was but was headed straight to my Mother and Sister who loved me totally. As I continued to admire the property, I noticed that I could see through my arm. Hmm, how strange. Then I looked back and could see a guy leaning over in the room I just left, needing my help. So, reluctantly, I went back, pressed my fist into his stomach and he started breathing again. Then I realized. I was trapped back here again.  
   NDE from heart attack.   

    2372.        Robert H NDE       9/26/2010.      NDE 4659.             I found myself coming up from behind and above my neighbor as she was walking down the hospital hallway. I noticed that she was carrying a McDonald's bag in her right hand. I can't say I followed her very long, and did not know where she was going. It really didn't feel unusual at the time, it just was. Noticed her clothes (jeans, shirt, etc.), and the cleanliness of the hospital. Don't recall any voices or noises.  
   NDE from severe pneumonia with an evidential OBE.   

    2371.        Sequoia H FDE       9/26/2010.      FDE 4651.             I was aware of train tracks and how my train tracks were coming to an abrupt end. It felt like I was in the 1800's in the middle of nowhere just as train tracks were laid in the American wilderness. I was very clear that this was 'the end of the line' for my life and me. The vision was more factual, than emotional as if I were watching a movie.  
   Waking vision prior to impact. Her scream was an intervening action that changed the outcome of her vision.   

    2370.        Flora A NDE       9/26/2010.      NDE 4681.             Flashes of colored light appeared as I moved through the tunnel.  There was wonderful music. I moved toward a light - dull at first, and then larger and brighter. Some robed individuals - in brown robes with hoods, met me. I am not aware of knowing them. We had a lot of conversation that I have never been able to remember. I saw my grandmother standing off to the side, and there was some conversation - again, not recalled. (At this time, my grandmother was in the hospital still alive). I could see past the hooded figures to a meadow. I wanted to keep going and enter the meadow, but the figures would not allow it.  
   NDE from falling.  Her grandmother was alive and in the hospital at the time of her NDE, but died shortly thereafter.   

    2369.        Sandra H NDE       9/26/2010.      NDE 4679.             I saw images that told me what I hate the most in others are those qualities I to have but do not see them in myself. I fit very neatly into all the areas I profess to hate in others. Love was the key to everything, acceptance and love. Also there was a lot of 'talk' about my making a decision, the results of the decision. If I returned to the body with pain and paralysis or left for good what would happen. Cannot remember everything often was in void then back out floating near the ceiling, lying above my body, zipping to sneak a look at my charts by floating above the shoulders of the doctors, then back into the void again.  
   NDE, void experience from brain hematoma.   

    2368.        Mark K NDE       9/26/2010.      NDE 4676.             I then saw a man in an earthen, light and dark brown dual cloth robe.  He was looking me in the eye from two hundred yards down the beach. As I noticed there was a colossal eggshell textured ROOF over the sun and the ocean, and all of the planet I felt I was on, but I felt it was not earth as I know my planet.  I kept my attention on the man as he walked all the way to me.  When we were face to face, I was focused on his radiant light blue eyes.  
   NDE from toxic coral poisoning. Woke up dead after twenty-nine hours in the morgue.   

    2367.        Farley H Probable NDE       9/26/2010.      Probable NDE 4675.             I specifically remember being in a foggy tunnel with someone at the end. No conversation was had but I remember being at peace with all things (including myself). I felt I was being asked to move towards the object but for whatever reason I did not.  
   Probable NDE from surgery complications.   

    2366.        Justin U NDE       9/26/2010.      NDE 4671.       From the UK.      Many events in my life I experienced, but not from how I remembered it, but from the point of view, I experienced it from how the people, animals, environment experienced it around me. I felt it as my own. The times I had made others happy, and sad, I felt it all as they did. It was very apparent that every single thought word and action affects everything around the entire universe, and indeed us including trees, plants, and animals too. I have been a long term vegetarian since about eighteen years old and I know this was appreciated and is a good choice in life. Spiritually it seemed to show proof of respect for all life, and even seemed to balance some of the negative and wicked things I have done in my life. In the Life review we judge ourselves; no one else does, the light/God did not, but with no ego left and no lies, we can't hide from what we have done and feel remorse and shame, especially in the presence of this love and light.  
   NDE from auto accident.   

    2365.        Jim B Probable NDE       9/25/2010.      Probable NDE 4669.             In October 2009, I was in critical condition with the H1N1 Flu. I was in a coma for three weeks, double pneumonia, total respiratory failure, intubated, and a medically induced coma. During this coma, I remembered nothing when I awoke except that a man approached me and took me by my right arm and stated, 'Walk with me'. When walking he stated to me 'Your job is not finished, you must go back.' This experience occurred in a total white area - as the inside of a Ping-Pong ball. During this period of my coma, the doctor had told my wife to expect the worse, as they could do no more. At one point during the coma (I believe coincides with my experience) I began a miraculous recovery as stated by my doctors.  
   Probable NDE from H1N1 Flu.   

    2364.        Roger F NDE       9/25/2010.      NDE 4667.             I knew instantly where I was and understood that this reality (Home) was where I had come from and had now returned. There came sensations of boundless love and boundless understanding. I was everywhere and everything in the universe, yet I was somewhere in particular (everywhere IS somewhere). The present, the past, and the future (all sense of time as we understand time) was combined into something I call, 'the Eternal Now'. In that eternal instant, a wave of love seemed to wash through me. Then came the Light. I was in it, part of it, and I understood it completely.  
   NDE from heart attack.   

    2363.        Elaine S NDE       9/25/2010.      NDE 4666.             I know that I coded. They had to use paddles on my heart. My intestines laid out and cleaned. Packed back together with gauze and given multiple meds. They did not staple me closed. Left open to drain and what's the use - covered which bandages. I don't have a time frame here. I know that I left my body. I floated up to the ceiling. Looked down at it but wasn't interested in it. I know that I floated home to see my daughters and husband. My husband, at the time, was Ron. He would swear that he was shocked to see my 'ghost' standing in the bedroom while he was in bed at night.  
   NDE from peritonitis, good OBE description.   

    2362.        Cynthia DM NDE       9/25/2010.      NDE 4665.             But as soon as it was over and I saw that I liked myself and had been a 'good' person, I totally relaxed and floated almost to the top of the water, face down. It scared my teacher and the other students so badly that the teacher jumped into the water with her clothes on and pulled me out. I had to be resuscitated. But I knew from then on that 'Judgment Day' was actually the day that WE see our lives like that, before we die. And I know that the object of life is to make sure that little movie is as pleasant as possible to view!  
   NDE from drowning as a teenager.   

    2361.        Christian D NDE       9/25/2010.      NDE 4662.       From New Zealand.      Then, I will try to explain as best I can, I was encased in love, warmth, light and felt happier than I ever have before or since. Everything and all that is good was in this light. In the light was a seemingly uncountable crowd of people who are my ancestors and relatives that have left here over the ages and are now there. I recognized the ones who have been here in my time here and at the front were also my dogs from throughout my time here. I felt absolutely that they were family that I had known forever and were there to bring me home.  
   NDE from an accident where he saw all his dogs he had prior to this experience.   

    2360.        Lisa C NDE       9/25/2010.      NDE 4661.             I looked forward and there was a bright, bright, beautiful light further up the pathway. Looking at the light it was as if I were in a tunnel. It got bigger on my end and getting smaller towards the light. The sky was the most beautiful; I mean the most beautiful blue color I have ever in my life seen. The blue was similar to the color of this page website, but unbelievably beautiful. I felt so safe, so calm I think the color made me feel this way, or maybe the light itself. I started to walk up the pathway towards the light. I was thinking man if this is how it feels to die; this is a piece of cake (exact thoughts). It felt so peaceful, so quiet, no noise, not even a breeze.  
   NDE from heart arrhythmia.

      2358.        Mike Y NDE       9/25/2010.      NDE 4655.             I passed out and immediately found myself in a large tube with highly polished sides that were like graphite (pencil lead). The sides were extremely polished and smooth. My conscious feelings were ecstatic. I was out of pain and felt absolutely WHOLE! My whole being was elevated and I felt better than anything I had ever experienced. As I went through the tunnel my whole life experience flashed in front of me, I would say every experience, and I saw how God had made them all work towards His good and perfect plans. I felt totally loved, accepted, secure, and happy.  
   NDE from illness and going unconscious.   

    2357.        Donavan S NDE       9/25/2010.      NDE 4653.             I entered an almost lime green world. I was in a store, just running up and down the aisles. I guess I was supposed to be shopping and I thought the lady was mad at me because I was misbehaving. She took me to the door (an old wooden turnstile type). She had a striped dress on and her hair was up like they used to wear in the 1950's. She was very beautiful. She implicated something like I couldn't come in the store right now and shut the door behind me. I heard no voices.  
   Child drowning NDE with atypical imagery.   

    2356.        Pamela K NDE       9/25/2010.      NDE 4649.             What exultant bliss! I realized that I had a choice to recognize and rest in this truth of who I really was and stay on the 'other side' or I could continue to re-enact the 'game' of being an imaginary personality. With the dawning of that realization I mentally 'turned' around again and saw a Light that was brighter than a million suns but which didn't hurt my vision. It radiated the most all-encompassing unconditional Love I've ever experienced. The Light 'felt' sentient - it had Presence - God - and the feeling of the love it emanated was like that of the father in the Bible welcoming home his prodigal son.  
   NDE from sleep apnea.   

    2355.        Jack NDE       9/25/2010.      NDE 4646.             The doctor kept slapping me on the cheek trying to keep me awake, afraid I would go into shock and die. I suspect that I flat-lined. I felt my soul leave my body. No more praying. It was a total, euphoric, out of body experience. I guess you could say heavenly or angelic. Picture that you are part of a cloud of smoke above your body but take away the smoke. All that is left is the soul. No pain, no sense of feeling, no sight, and no smell just the existence of the soul. But it exists.  
   NDE from blood loss.   

    2354.        Frank C NDE       9/25/2010.      NDE 4645.             Next, I was at a place where the sky was a golden yellow.  There was a gate to my left. I felt so at peace, in no pain and seemed to be aware that this was where I wanted to be. I believe I was just outside the gates of Heaven.  
   NDE from breathing stopped.   

    2353.        Star K Probable NDE       9/25/2010.      Probable NDE 4635.       From India.      In the world where I was, everything was bright white and gold. There were numerous small temples. Suddenly I appeared in a small white temple with statues of Jesus, Mary etc. Beautiful music was there.  A voice called out names of saints and holy people, this went on non-stop. All of a sudden, I appeared in another temple, there is a huge statue of Ganesh (an Indian God). It is so big and bright white, which is unusual in India. I heard a beautiful song. The last name mentioned was the name of a local saint that had lived at the spot. Ramana Maharishi - that's when I woke up.  
   Had leptospirosis. Describes awakening, but then was very sick.   

    2352.        Dan P NDE       5/2/2010 & 9/25/2010.      NDE 4633/4782.             I clearly remember being in another state of existence. I was in a short line, speaking to Jesus.  Amazingly, he took as much time with each person as needed. I learned a lot from listening to the conversation of the person in front of me. It was clear I would be passing through a doorway or portal to ‘heaven’, but then the experience was over.  
   NDE during cardiac arrest.   

    2351.        Stephanie R NDE       9/25/2010.      NDE 4630.             At first I didn't panic and tried to get to the surface but the waves kept me under. The pain in my lungs came first from holding my breath, then when I couldn't any longer I started gulping water and sucking it up my nose, the pain was a terrible burning. Then my ears were making a whooshing sound and felt like they would with the worst earache I ever had. The next thing I recall is a total silence and being in a white bubble that totally encased me. The pain was gone completely and I could breathe freely. The bubble was filled with what I can only describe as thousands of tiny stars like a fine stardust that was the most beautiful sight I had ever seen or have ever seen to this day. I felt totally safe and warm, it was the most protected I had ever felt.  
   Child NDE from drowning.   

    2350.        Nelson B NDE       6/20/2010.      NDE 22275.             I was hovering about thirty feet into air when two guys in baseball uniforms pulled over and took me out of car and placed me in the back of their pickup truck. One of them gave me CPR while the other one drove to hospital. Hospital attendants came out to truck and put me on gurney. As the gurney went into the emergency room, my perspective was still about thirty feet above. I was one or two floors above my body looking down on the emergency room staff trying to resuscitate me. I recall all instructions of the doctor, color of nurses' hair, names of the people who were given instructions. They used the paddles before they figured out I had coffee in my chest. They made two incisions and stuck tubes in my chest. Coffee was draining out onto the floor. Additional procedures were performed before the paddles restarted my heart. When this happened, my recollection ends.  
   NDE from ruptured esophagus while driving.   

    2349.        Sandra V NDE       6/20/2010.      NDE 22271.             At that moment I also saw a vision of my daughter that at that time I was not far enough along to be medically told I was having a girl, but I knew that I was having a baby girl and I saw her, I saw what she would look like and everything. I then remember seeing my husband’s face and that was the last thing I saw in the darkness. It was like I opened my eyes next but when I opened them I wasn't me in my body anymore, it was me looking at my body from the other side of the windshield.  
   She was pregnant at the time of the accident and met her future daughter on the other side.   

    2348.        Sally K NDE       2/12/2010.      NDE 22261.             I decided that we would ride on the hood of my sisters' car to dry off faster.  I don't remember falling off the hood, but my friend said she tried to get my sister to stop and she wasn't paying any attention.  I was drug at least a quarter mile down a dirt road.  I remember all of the sudden I was sitting on the very top of the car, and I was looking down at myself stuck UNDER the car.  I watched myself for a little bit and never saw myself move.  I was in no pain at all as I sat there.  
   NDE with a good description of OBE.   

    2346.        Wanda A NDE       9/13/2010.      NDE 4636.       From Puerto Rico.      Then all of a sudden, everyone in the room disappeared and the room was filled with the most beautiful white light, it engulfed everything, and at the same time the struggle my body was having with death left me. I could only feel overwhelmingly fine, at peace, surrounded by love, the purest love, unconditional total love. I knew I was 'dead' and told God that if it was time for me to go, I would go happy and willing but if He had something else I needed to do, I would go back. Just as soon as I had that thought, everyone reappeared in the room, the nurses, doctors, my sister praying.  
   NDE from Nurse living in Puerto Rico.   

    2345.        Eric NDE       9/13/2010.      NDE 4634.             The first thing I saw or noticed I was in a void are a huge bubble with black and orange jagged lines, I remember looking all around up, down, all around, and that's all I could see. From that I was yanked from the lines by like a umbilical cord into outer space that pulled me into a huge brain looking center, I would say heaven's emergency room. I remember lying in a room with two hospital beds.  I remember a lady, how she looked like us with bigger black eyes.  I remember right away she knew I wasn't supposed to be there (this was communicated to me without her saying a word I guess basically mental that I totally understood) and I was sent back in a flash.  
   Four year old bit an electric cord.   

    2344.        Betty J NDE       9/13/2010.      NDE 4632.             I viewed everything - floating beneath the tree. I saw my husband and me lying in the driveway. I saw the lady in her curlers and robe run from her house. I was not frightened - just very curious. I looked at my left hand, turning it over and over amazed that I had a form. I could feel the rain falling on me. I saw the ambulances coming- and noticed that one was a Ford and one a Cadillac. For some reason it seemed important to look at those models. I came to as they were putting me into the ambulance.  
   Two NDEs, one from going unconscious and the other from a car accident. What she saw in the OBE phase was verified.   

    2343.        Teresa C NDE       9/13/2010.      NDE 4631.             All of the sudden I was surrounded by pure, bright, brilliant, Heaven white. It was white, but not earthly white. Seriously, there are no words that can explain the beauty of colors in Heaven.  I was in a cell. It was made of brown metal. I had a tan 'potato bag' on my body as a form of clothing. I had brown leather bands 'belts' around my neck, waist, wrists and ankles. I believe at first I was somewhat confused. There was love all around me. Much more love than a person can feel here on earth. One by one, those thick brown bands fell off. The door to the 'cell' opened. I walked out and fell to my knees. I couldn't look up. I knew it was Jesus. I was in the presence of the Lord.  
   NDE from pulmonary embolism.   

    2342.        NS C NDE       9/13/2010.      NDE 4628.       From Sweden.      Next what happened was that I was just raised out of my bed. I met a kind of CEO or executive director (like in a company) and others, I was not allowed to see my life review, they scrolled my life review behind me to the left, but I could see the lights from it a little in my surroundings, very kind of them. I got a smile from God a little later. The thing next was that God and those others disappeared away, and they dragged before me a place, there was a boundary and I got to the boundary I was allowed get a little inside. I saw kindness and familiarity in the most convenient way. There were no humans for me to meet in that world, no animals and no insects, only plants, the green things. There were mountains with snow, pure things, a lot of things to do; I loved the world they wanted to give me, very kind of them.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest. Some atypical elements in experience - might be due to some extent to language issues.   

    2341.        Amie B NDE       9/13/2010.      NDE 4625.             I felt a TREMENDOUS sensation of Joy. I was happier than I had ever felt in my entire life. There was no pain, only this entirely consuming feeling of Joy. I felt like laughing it was so powerful. The light was golden and bright and I could hear this music that is totally indescribable. It permeated the air - came from everywhere and nowhere - and is unlike any music I've ever heard on earth.  
   NDE due to respiratory arrest following surgery. Interesting in that she heard beautiful music from 'everywhere' though she is deaf in one ear.   

    2340.        Tammy G Probable NDE       9/13/2010.      Probable NDE 4623.             My hearing was muffled too and I told them - I felt I was dying or would be brain damaged - I was still very conscious and couldn't understand why I hadn't gone under already but still experiencing this horror. Everything was happening so fast and so slow at the same time. Just after the people in the room, including my husband (who was talking to me) turned into the silhouettes, everything disappeared for a second and the next second I was looking at Space! I saw a black sky with pinpoints of light - like a black velvet curtain with tiny pinpoints of light. I was still conscious and not in a dream state - I was just 'looking' at this before me. Then the next thing I could see everyone starting to come back into view - their black silhouettes were slowly turning back into features again and I was so relieved and said to my husband, 'I can see you again!'  
   Probable NDE due to allergic reaction.   

    2339.        Stuart F NDE       9/13/2010.      NDE 4622.             I do not remember having a problem with the water, or breathing, or any panic. I just 'all of a sudden' was in a great bright, cloudy, very blue skies, area and I was standing on what one might call an escalator and it was going up. It was very pretty and I was as calm as you can be. There was no sound. Nothing was moving, I did not see any other persons, but the area was huge like standing in the middle of a desert except that it was white clouds and blue background. I have forgotten much about the period before I went swimming, and remember little about the immediate afterward except that once the water came out of me and I regained consciousness I was surrounded by aunts all hugging and kissing. They were all terrified. I had no idea what had happened except that it was nice.  
   NDE due to drowning at age six. Shared sixty-five years later.   

    2338.        Shawn M Probable NDE       9/13/2010.      Probable NDE 4621.       From China.      The sky was so red, it was not the blood red, and it was very spectacular! There were a lot of red clouds, the land was red too, so I went ahead and I came to a red river, the water was so beautiful and red, so far I feel relaxed and happy, a particular emotional experience! Firstly, I saw a person who I didn't know at all killed in the river. (After I told the story to my grandfather, he said his grandfather was killed in a similar place, and all of the details were almost the same! I was surprised.) There was a ferry and a boatman there.  
   Probable NDE from suicide attempt.   

    2337.        Patty P NDE       9/13/2010.      NDE 4620.             I then noticed I was at the ceiling of the car. There was a golden light all around me. I felt calm. I was in communication with two 'beings' that I couldn't see but felt their presence. They seemed to be part of the golden light that surrounded me. We communicated about something. I'm not sure what the content of the 'conversation' was. I remember feeling that they were telling me something important. I don't remember what the message was.  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    2336.        Harold T NDE       9/13/2010.      NE 4617.             I came up a second time and was trying to get the lifeguard's attention but went down with more water in my lungs again. I was suddenly out of my body. I recall a total lack of fear. A matter-of-fact feeling that is difficult to express. It was like my body was a distant memory. I was trying to communicate with the lifeguard. He was a young boy and talking to a young girl. They were talking about going out to have a dinner and then a movie. I said look, look. I'm over there drowning. I could see my body floating below the surface across the pool. The guard remained inattentive except to his female friend.  
   NDE at age eleven due to drowning. Shared fifty-seven years later.   

    2335.        Nancy RB Probable NDE       9/13/2010.      Probable NDE 4616.             I fell out of an attic onto a concrete garage floor head first. My mother said that when she came to the doorway of the garage, my body was blue and I was not breathing. I remember having an out of body experience right after I fell, because I was standing in the attic looking at my sister as she came around some boxes, saw me lying on the floor, and climbed down the ladder yelling for my mother. Then I was at the opening of the attic, looking down on myself on the garage floor. Then there was nothingness. The next thing I remember was being in my body, lying on my mother's bed, hearing my mother crying and screaming and feeling my body jerk and twist violently over and over again.  
   Probable NDE at age two due to head injury.   

    2334.        Gregg S NDE       9/13/2010.      NDE 4615.             It was about this time that I became aware that I was observing this event from an elevated position in the room, on top of a bank of lockers. At the time, I was confused as to how I could be in two places at once and immediately realized that my consciousness was not in my body. Two medical technician types came and started to pull me up off the floor in a rather brisk manner. I watched in amazement as my body reacted by unfolding my arms from the crossed position on my chest, which caused the two medical technicians to collide above my body. This all seemed very comical to me at the time. In fact the entire matter was funny to me.  
   NDE due to Novocain reaction. Two other experiences as well.   

    2333.        Patricia M NDE       9/13/2010.      NDE 4613.             I was in the lake in a large tire inner tube, but unable to swim.  I slipped out of the inner tube, head first into the water.  I remember nothing except knowing that I was at the bottom of the lake and wondering why I felt no discomfort or the sensation of the inability to breath.  I laid there, looking up through the ripples in the water, and felt very calm and peaceful, thinking this situation was beautiful.  I did not feel my body, but was very aware of the presence of what I believed was the sun shining through the water.  I then felt very warm, and the "sun" became more and more brilliant until it seemed to surround my body.  I continued feeling warmer and having a sense of amazement at the beautiful place, I was in. The light and warmth from the sun enveloped my body.  I was drawn to this light and thought, "This is the most beautiful place in the world".  
   NDE due to drowning at age five. Shared fifty-six years later.   

    2332.        Guy B NDE       9/13/2010.      NDE 4612.             I don't re-call seeing a tunnel with light - but I do re-call a feeling of calm and warmth and pure peace. I knew I was dead, and remember thinking to myself 'this isn't bad.' One part of me didn't want to leave my family - but at the same time, I didn't want to leave where I was. It's hard to describe, but it was the most beautiful experience, I was so at peace, it was like I was enveloped in pure love  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    2331.        Shari G Possible NDE       9/13/2010.      Possible NDE 4611.             I was undergoing surgery for removal of an ovary when I found 'myself' above the operating table sitting on a bar attached to the ceiling. I was aware of the people and the body on the operating table, but was not at all interested in what was going on. There was a 'being' next to me - I could not see this being, but was aware that it was there. I was blithely swinging on the bar, like I used to do as a kid on the monkey bars. The emotional feeling was one of complete freedom, contentment, and happiness - something which I will never forget as I tend to be somewhat of a tense person.  
   Possible NDE. OBE during surgery.   

    2330.        MHT Probable NDE       9/11/2010.      Probable NDE 4716.       From the Netherlands. Original in Dutch, translated by Annelies.      Suddenly I felt a serene tranquility. I can't move my body, the headache is gone and it is good, everything is peaceful and calm. I have a feeling of intense HAPPINESS. Nothing can compare to this feeling, no relaxation through music, nothing at all. Everything inside me has been switched off, how wonderful not to feel pain or sorrow. Suddenly I feel I'm back on my bed and I'm immediately conscious of everything around me. I don't feel so tense anymore; I feel a kind of deliverance.  
   Probable NDE due to sepsis.   

    2329.        Peter B NDE       9/11/2010.      NDE 4610.             My first experience was a feeling of floating. I didn't see my body, but I knew that I was not in my body. On my right, there was the sound of a large crowd, voices that were so numerous, I couldn't tell if I knew anyone, but it sounded like a happy party. A tall wall separated me from everyone. To my left, I saw a tunnel of a sort, the walls seemed to be turning and I was slowly being drawn into it, not quite sure if I was supposed to go into it. Eventually I started down the tunnel and saw a brilliant light that glowed so bright, that I couldn't see a face but a silhouette of a man. I knew he was the Lord.  
   NDE due to pulmonary embolus.   

    2328.        Samantha K Probable NDE       9/11/2010.      Probable NDE 4607.             It was as if I blinked and suddenly I was standing in front of Jesus and my (deceased) mom. Everything was dark except them. I felt so good and happy - an indescribable peace physically, mentally and spiritually. Jesus just smiled but said nothing. My mom spoke to me even though her lips didn't move - it seemed telepathic. She said, 'Sam, it's not your time yet. You have to go back and take care of your dad and Damien (my son).  
   Probable NDE from illness.   

    2327.        Frank T Probable NDE       9/11/2010.      Probable NDE 4605.             At several times during the surgery, I was aware of events that were occurring in the operating room. I was also aware of the presence of my deceased grandmother, which gave me a strange sense of peace.  
   Probable NDE during surgery after severe trauma.   

    2326.        Gail T Probable NDE       9/11/2010.      Probable NDE 4604.             I remember my first thought being, 'No wonder humans are so depressed all of the time, bodies are so Heavy.' I had no eyes but could see. Yet, there was nothing to see. It was not dark, nor light. It just was. I felt as though I could stay there forever and need nothing. I felt that I could just be, and need nothing else. There was such calm and peacefulness that I wanted to stay.  
   Probable NDE due to apparent loss of consciousness.   

    2325.        Rita T Probable NDE       9/11/2010.      Probable NDE 4586.             As they hooked me up to the drip to put me under, I experienced a falling down a long white tube and I could see their faces looking down their end of the tube. I came out into a black partial void. I could see wispy cloud like material. I could see only in front and to the sides of me. I had no body but I could see as though I did. I had no memory of any family or friends or any previous life. I felt myself moving upwards at about a forty-five degree angle. I had no fear of falling or fear of height. As I was moving upward I saw a very large area of condensed light that coated me in such a feeling of love that I thought to myself (even though I had no brain that I could sense) if this is what it is like to die then I can't wait. Then inside my mind there was a voice that sounded like it could be taken for a male or female that said, 'No, we are not ready for you yet. There will be more pain. You will become a nun.'  
   Probable NDE during dental surgery.   

    2324.        Carlos A FDE       9/11/2010.      FDE 4602.             In the pitch blackness setting I found myself begging a non-present God to let me stay and remember telling him I was too young to die. Immediately after the thought of my daughter arose in my thoughts and I felt sadness for her as I thought my time was ending. Subsequently I told God I had to take care of her since I was her father and provider. Immediately I saw images of my life as if someone did a slideshow of my life entirely. When my daughter's images showed up, I felt love and sadness. I continued begging God and all of a sudden I left the pitch black place and it was as if I woke up again.  
   Fear-Death Experience from untreated Hashimoto Thyroiditis, panicked and left his body.   

    2323.        Carol S Possible NDE       9/11/2010.      Possible NDE 4601.             I remember going in and out of being awake phases, but at one point I do recall feeling so at peace, being in a field of the most beautiful flowers, blue sky, peaceful light emitting all around me. I recall being alone in the field and having no pain, just a wonderful, wonderful warm experience where I wanted to stay.  
   Possible NDE from child-birth. Definitely an OBE though.   

    2322.        Julia J NDE       9/11/2010.      NDE 4599.             I fell onto a playground area. I saw myself sitting on top of a climbing frame, observing my body on the ground below. My grandmother, who had been deceased for several years, was with me. I remember my mother was present, crying and being comforted by a neighbor. I wasn't feeling any emotion; it was a very detached feeling.  
   Child NDE from falling on the playground. Experiencer is now a pediatric and hospice nurse.   

    2321.        Stanley P NDE       9/11/2010.      NDE 4598.             One by one the souls were pulled into the physical universe but there seemed to be a voluntary nature to the participation. This was an extremely interesting experience since I witnessed everything from the beginning, formation of stars, etc. But as the physical universe evolved and as my soul was pulled into the universe I seemed to focus on just the Earth, but saw and experienced it on a micro level, having simultaneous, complete knowledge of every bit of earth especially of any living thing, including the smallest microbes in the soil or ocean. It's difficult now to remember the feeling of being simultaneously aware of every living thing. Along with the total history of the earth I saw and experienced my little part in it, thus seeing my own life and death.  
   NDE from going unconscious. Amazing universal experience!   

    2320.        Ronald M NDE       9/11/2010.      NDE 4597.             The actual event I can recall perfectly because it has never left my emotional life and has led to lifestyle changes. From darkness (coma or death), I experienced a grand soothing luminous energy. If there is any definition of a 'love-light shining' this would have made the perfect video. I began to rise, or a feeling of being lifted through the light. The light seemed to surround me as a secure feeling, so bright, but so inviting. Ahead I could see a Being, not an angel with wings, but identifiable as a human. Also, as I noticed the Being, my perception of approaching seemed to resemble the travel through a tunnel. However, upon my arrival to the power of the presence, the Being said, 'It is not your time.' And I felt as if I did not want to return, or leave this feeling of bliss.  
   NDE due to hyperglycemia from diabetes.   

    2319.        Steven H NDE       9/11/2010.      NDE 4594.             I had a thought, I know I play guitar, I'll wiggle my fingers, and so, I wiggled my fingers on my left hand. As I did, I turned my head to look at my fingers. (I was lying on my back.) I looked down and saw myself (body) in the fetal position, lying on my left side. I was about five to six feet above my body. I did not panic, nor did I feel any fear. What I felt was 'the peace that surpasses all human understanding.' It is hard for me to describe. It was at this point the two silhouettes turned their heads (slightly) and turned towards me. I heard no audible words, but they told me 'Go to sleep. Everything will be alright.'  
   NDE from smoke inhalation.   

    2318.        Dave G NDE       9/11/2010.      NDE 4593.             I remember saying, 'I feel so good and all the pain is gone.' It wasn't just the pain of the heart attack, I felt free of pains I didn't even know I had. I felt wonderful, so light and free of 'everything' physical. I remember saying, to myself, 'If I close my eyes I am just going to slip away.' I closed my eyes and, suddenly, with a physical shock, I was out of my body, standing, alone, in a gray darkness. I stood there for a bit and looked around but while I could see my naked body and feet, I couldn't make out anything else. I remember saying, 'God, is this where I am going to spend eternity?' Suddenly, to my left, I could make out a 'cave?' (Best way I can put it) entrance which was as dark as anything I had ever seen. I really had a feeling of fear and apprehension and knew I didn't want to go there. At about the same time I had a sense of absolute peace and saw a 'path' leading off and up to the right, which had begun to get lighter. I began 'moving', not walking, just moving, like on the moving walkways in some airports towards that path.  
   NDE void experience from cardiac arrest.   

    2317.        Julian D NDE       9/11/2010.      NDE 4592.             During my life review, I understood that I had hardly begun to experience what I had incarnated this time to do/learn, and that I had a choice to either go back to my broken body as an adult, or to await another incarnation to pick up where I had left off. I was shown what was going on with Earth people at that time/place where I had just left, and what would be taking place over the next roughly fifty years. I decided that I did not want to do a re-run of my childhood and young adulthood again, and to return to the damaged body.  
   NDE from car accident.   

    2316.        Virginia D NDE       9/11/2010.      NDE 4591.             When I crossed over, I met the council and God of the Universe. I viewed my life and several events and realized that we are all one with the Universe so when I hurt someone I was really hurting myself and even more so I was hurting every soul in the Universe. I realized I was pure white light and each soul had a different hue, but I could see them. Many times other souls could not make the viewing so they would walk away from the light.  
   NDE from heart-attack. Interesting life review.   

    2315.        Priscilla C NDE       9/11/2010.      NDE 4589.             As I went into this coma/or whatever you may want to call it I was not in the physical body but in a spiritual body. I saw these unearthly beings that were trying to pull me to their side. They were pulling at me from both sides and I was in a struggle with them not to go over to their side. I struggled very hard to get away from them. I cannot describe them at all. As soon as I got away from them, I saw a very bright, bright light and I began to move at the speed of light.  
   NDE due to unconsciousness from hypoglycemia.   

    2314.        Eric H Probable NDE       9/11/2010.      Probable NDE 4588.       From Australia.      Being a young child, I was physically in pain by the jabbing of sharp hospital instruments. I remember looking at the operating light above me and looking into it. At the moment of time and instant, I could see what seemed like colorful jelly fish like beings. They were a living form radiating imminent light. Beautiful. There were hundreds, maybe thousands, or even millions. At the same time, I could still see the doctors, nurses and surgeons working on me desperately doing what they had to do. These beautiful colorful radiant jellyfish-like beings felt like to me that they were waiting for me. They were rainbow colored but could change colors of the light that radiated off them. It's indescribable. I have never seen them in this world.  
   Child Probable NDE from ruptured appendix.   

    2313.        Cynthia T NDE       9/1/2010.      NDE 4764.       From Canada. Original in French, translated to English by Magalie.      Right after they left, the room looked like it was fading away and as I was telling the nurse about it everything went white - as if I was blinded by a strong light. I could hear everything, even the nurse who was on the phone asking for medication. It was like fainting but instead of being dark, it was sparkling white. I felt like I was floating on a cloud and it felt so good, it was an amazing sensation - until I came back in my body.  
   NDE from childbirth complications.   

    2312.        Captain David Perry NDE         6/4/2010.      NDE 16044.               
   NDE from 1796   

    2311.        Kathy G Possible NDE       8/18/2010.      Possible NDE 4743.       From France. Original in French, translated to English by Magalie.      After being in labor for nineteen hours my baby was stuck and the doctor decided to do an emergency cesarean section. When they were ready to cut, the epidural wasn't working anymore so they put me under anesthesia. I found myself in a very bright hallway, very beautiful and very cozy. At the end of the hallway, there were some figures, which I couldn't make out but they were calling me by my first name and asking me to live, telling me that it was time; I had to go. At the same time, someone was slapping me in the face, calling me by my last name and asking me to wake up.  
   Probable NDE from childbirth complications.   

    2310.        Sara NDE       8/13/2010.      NDE 4700.       From Paraguay. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon.      Everything started to lose shape, fading. I could just see the outlines of things, which then started to shine, until everything became a light, growing stronger and stronger and changing from bluish to white. From the darkness, I felt a mixture of very unusual emotions, a feeling of peace, tranquility, happiness, joy - I felt safe, sure, in unity with everything, a part of something immense.  
   NDE from loss of consciousness and seizure.   

    2309.        Alberta L NDE       8/10/2010.      NDE 4582.             I went through a tunnel and into the brightest light that you can imagine but it was not blinding. It was so calming and filled with love. It was a thousand times better than the love you experience on earth. Everything was white when I passed through the light. I saw a bunch of people dressed in white robes. They were communicating without talking or moving their mouths and floating without walking. A figure came close to me.  It was my great grandmother.  
   NDE due to allergic reaction from anesthetic during c'sarian section delivery.   

    2308.        Terry M NDE       8/10/2010.      NDE 4581.             I have a bit of a memory about me being rushed through double doors and after that - nothing. The next thing I recall is a sensation of floating in a void, a grey like substance, and experiencing incredible peace, the absolute absence of any kind of fear. This experience would be interrupted by nurse Amy (she was one of the emergency room nurses) or Dr. Lee, (emergency room MD) calling my name and I would achieve a bit of consciousness. I would return to this 'void'. I became mildly aggravated with the medical types for calling me back.  
   NDE and other experiences. Experience described in most detail was from illness following surgery.   

    2307.        Diane L NDE       8/10/2010.      NDE 4580.             I was at the local beach with my sister. It was a balmy summer day with waves about three feet high. I had decided to go into the water, which was warm. I then went body surfing. I started tumbling under the water. I kept trying to right myself but could not. Suddenly, I was watching myself roll. I was not upset I felt peace. I was in a large expanse of black watching my life flash before me. I looked down and somehow I was righted upwards.  
   NDE at age fourteen due to drowning.   

    2306.        Trevor FB NDE       8/10/2010.      NDE 4579.       From the UK      In fact, there was a great sense of calmness.  I knew with great certainty that there was nothing I could do about it.  The situation was entirely out of my control and therefore I could relax and just observe very closely.   My point of vision was above and slightly to the rear of my head.  I noticed (I use the word 'notice' advisedly as I don't feel I 'saw' it) a loose circle of what I can only describe as 'stillness' or 'clearness' that was a mild distortion of the air, fabric of vision, in front of me. There was also a strong and overwhelming sense that beyond that was a very bright environment but I neither saw it nor experienced it.  
   NDE due to heart attack.   

    2305.        Ellen N NDE       8/10/2010.      NDE 4577.             I realized that I was no more than an eye or something with vision, which was me, and I was on top of the lights in the surgery room. Then I realized it was me and I was looking around and suddenly I looked down and there I was looking at myself laying on the surgery table The doctor was pounding on my chest trying to revive me. Then I realized that I was looking down at my body and for just seconds I knew what was going on. I felt as if I was the smallest entity imaginable almost like I was the smallest water drop but with thinking abilities to recognize myself as being almost a spirit of some kind. But when I had realized that I must be dying the next thing of acknowledgment was when they were waking me up out the anesthesia.  
   NDE under general anesthesia.   

    2304.        Sally P NDE       8/10/2010.      NDE 4576.             Then I was in an unrecognizable 'place', feeling very comfortable, not concerned or worried. Felt 'presence' and feeling I could communicate, but not speech nor hearing. My overwhelming and only concern was that although the feeling of love and peace was enormous, I needed to return to earth to raise my daughters of seven and four. What came back from the presence was, 'Whatever you need to do you will do.' That made me feel even more relaxed. I enjoyed staying a while longer and feeling the overwhelming love flood over me.  
   NDE due to infection.   

    2303.        Michael O Probable NDE       8/10/2010.      Probable NDE 4575.             I knew him better than I knew anyone in the room. It was as though I had known him forever. He looked at me and gave me a choice to stay or go. Without hesitation, I said let's go. I was ready. I had been battling illness for three years. I had been through chemo, and tons of drugs. Not to mention the worst pain ever with what I was currently experiencing. I looked back with no regret, knowing that my family could not lose in the end. I was tired and wanted terribly to be with this being. He solely cared for me and loved me so much. I made my choice to go.  
   Probable NDE due to illness.   

    2302.        Crystal M NDE       8/10/2010.      NDE 4572.             The next thing I remember, was being surrounded by the most beautiful light that human words can never explain. There were two slender beings with me, talking to me. I could not make out any features because the light coming from them was so intense. One was a little shorter than the other was. At that time, I knew exactly who they were. I do not believe that I knew them on this earth. I remember communicating with the light all around me. I knew it was God. I could touch the light and it was communicating emotions and thoughts to me. I have never felt that much love and utter peace. I had this overwhelming understanding that EVERYTHING was exactly as it was supposed to be. Everything that was or is was just perfect.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    2301.        Teri R NDE       8/10/2010.      NDE 4571.             Then I emerged from the tunnel into an indescribable place of peace and tranquility. There was the most beautiful Being of White Light there. With the level of understanding I had at the time, I saw that he took on an image so that I could relate and feel comfortable but that his true essence was Light and Love. He appeared to me as an older man with long gray hair and a beard. But what stood out above anything else was that he loved me unconditionally. The feeling of being in his presence was something that felt like I was 'home' - in a sense that I had never known. I saw that my true essence was also this energy of love but as he reviewed my life with me, I received the understanding that I was the one who removed myself from the benefits and bliss of love by the anger I felt over some experiences I had had growing up. I saw how important it is to project feelings of love instead of the energy I was projecting through my emotions and feelings about life.  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    2300.        Lylia P NDE       8/10/2010.      NDE 4568.             As I faced a door, I touched the handle. The handle was extremely warm, and I pulled my hand away. Then the door vanished. My first house fire occurred a year later. Then, I was placed in front of a large chair, with a strict looking woman on it. Then my mother went to court a month later with a female judge.  
   NDE at age three due to head injury. Interesting future visions.   

    2299.        JC Possible NDE       8/10/2010.      Possible NDE 4563.             I was alone in my room in bed the day after the open heart surgery. I was wondering if my adult son was in the waiting room. Immediately upon that thought, my consciousness/awareness was moving down the hallway in Hopkins. 'I' was about five feet above the floor and passed over a gurney. I found myself in the waiting room. I looked around and noticed two little (petite/small boned) black girls around five years of age sitting together in one large chair. They appeared to be twins. They were very neat and had braids. One had a book she was looking at. The other was sitting slightly behind her and looking over the other's shoulder at the book. I looked for my son. When I saw that he wasn't there, I said to myself, 'There's no reason to stay here.' Immediately upon saying that, 'I' was back in my bed.  
   OBE possible NDE after heart surgery.   

    2298.        Melissa C NDE       8/10/2010.      NDE 4562.             The next thing I remember was being up by the ceiling, wondering why I could fly. I saw the mint green tiles with the black tile border around the top of the ceiling; I looked up, and saw a clock. I'm certain this was a span of only seconds. Then I looked down and was observing my own surgery. I was small, so I had no clue what was going on. I was a shy child so I thought to myself, 'I will just stay here and be quiet.' At that moment, the surgeon and staff seemed to be in a panic, but I was distracted by the sounds of a playground to my right.  
   NDE at age four from complication during surgery for perforated appendix.   

    2297.        Margie A NDE       8/10/2010.      NDE 4561.             I instantly left the room. (It was a huge room-that was strange; I worked at the same hospital and there wasn't a room like that anywhere.) Now I was moving in a wonderful soft pinkish-golden presence. The presence with me was Love and Peace and I was wrapped inside. It was quiet and so beautiful that I wanted to stay there forever. Outside of this presence was a golden light.  
   NDE due to childbirth. Shared forty-eight years later.   

    2296.        Arnaud S NDE       8/10/2010.      NDE 4690.       From France.  Original in French, translated to English by Magalie.      I started playing the 'choking game'. I was near a pond in the schoolyard, surrounded by my friends. I felt myself going and then I only remember seeing everything that was happening around the pond and myself. The notion of time did not exist. It was like I was floating above the scenery: my friends were speaking and laughing while two other friends were holding me. I felt a kind of warmth, intense wellbeing and felt as if I had total knowledge of everything. When I came back I was told I was unconscious for about ten seconds and that two friends had caught me as I fell.  
   Beginnings of a NDE from choking.   

    2295.        Sandra K NDE       8/8/2010.      NDE 4560.             Finally I looked up to see if she was okay. That's when I noticed I was hovering just above our bodies, about where the roof of the car was. I again answered my sister's cries but this time I could see myself knocked out with my head in my chest. I was outside my body long enough to realize that she couldn't hear me because I wasn't in my physical body therefore I had no vocal cords. What was weird though was I could hear my voice just as I did when I was in my body.  
   NDE due to car accident.   

    2294.        David B FDE       8/8/2010.      FDE 4557.             There in front of me was a very large body of yellow and white bright light. I remember the colors and the distinction of the two colors, like clouds. In the middle of the light was my mother smiling. My mother has a beautiful smile and this was her finest smile. It was from her waist up; she looked younger, about thirty. Her head was moving slightly and she was looking at me. This image was about thirty to forty feet in front of me angled up. The image was about ten to fifteen feet tall. I was not afraid - virtually no thought except thinking how beautiful and loving my mother was.  
   NDE vs Fear-Death Experience from near drowning. Experience began while he was frantically swallowing water, suggesting possibility that this is Fear-Death Experience. Experience included a living person (his mother) which is very unusual.   

    2293.        Dani C NDE       8/8/2010.      NDE 4556.             I had consumed a large amount of pills and alcohol. When I came to, I was floating above my body. It was a very neutral feeling initially. I remember it being dark. I started to ascend towards light and feeling joy - although that word does not do justice to what I was feeling. Then I was told to go back. It is not your time. I remember feeling sad. I have no conscious memory of going back in my body. I woke the next day, ill from the side effects of the poisons I had put in my body.  
   NDE at age fifteen due to suicide attempt.   

    2292.        Anne R NDE       8/8/2010.      NDE 4553.             June 21, 1957, I turned fifteen years old. A week later, after going to the mailbox to mail my grandparents a thank you note, I was strangled and then kidnapped. I later came to in a cornfield. SOMETHING told me to pretend I was dead. I was aware someone was there - later I heard him start to leave. He said repeatedly, 'She's dead, she's dead.' All I wanted to do was go to sleep. While I was 'asleep', I saw blue sky and lots of very bright light in the background of a 'spiritual' figure (a man - GOD?) in flowing red robes commanding me in a very stern voice: 'Anne - get up!' I just wanted to sleep. He again commanded me to get up. Somehow I did. I stumbled through the corn and later came to a dirt road. Why I turned right instead of left, I don't know. I soon saw a farm house and collapsed in their yard. They called the ambulance.  
   NDE at age fifteen due to criminal attack. Message in the NDE likely saved her life.   

    2291.        Joni P NDE       8/8/2010.      NDE 4552.             She said I was to stay there with her and I asked her if this was school. She said it was something like a school, which made me happy, as I wanted to go to school like my three older sisters. She took my hand and led me down a path into a very beautiful place. Everything was perfect, rolling hills, green grass and a stream running nearby. She said she was not sure if I were able to stay, she would have to leave me for a while to find out. I was not allowed past a certain place. On the other side, it looked like there were crystal buildings which I thought must be the school.  
   NDE at age four due to illness. Shared seventy-three years later.   

    2290.        Joel H NDE       8/8/2010.      NDE 4551.             Suddenly, my consciousness was ripped from my body. I was hurled through a corridor-like tunnel that I could see through. Outside were thousands of planets that I passed at a tremendous speed. At the end of the tunnel, was a pinpoint of light that was growing larger and larger. My emotional state was that I was experiencing a very relaxed and loving feeling; in fact, I felt like I was a Prince coming home.  
   NDE due to heart attack.   

    2289.        Paul H Probable NDEs       8/8/2010.      Probable NDEs 4549.             1954, 1997 - Both experience of void and reaching incredible light, all colors, almost to boundary line. Experiences later, e.g. 1974, sudden access to every book I've ever read, many human languages, whatever search terms, photographic - then whoosh-like feeling, back-into-body, seated near four other people, talking, who did not notice that I had 'been gone'... Synesthesia - hearing colors, seeing sounds.  
   Probable NDEs due to illness.   

    2288.        Anita C NDE       8/8/2010.      NDE 4543.             During a dental procedure there was a bright light that I rose up to and was subsequently fully engulfed by. A very calming male voice told me I had a choice to move on further into the light or stay in my present element. I was looking down and was able to recall the tops of the heads of all the medical personnel in the room. I was briefly considering going further into the light.  
   NDE due to anesthetic complication at age seven. Experience shared sixty-four years later.   

    2287.        Maria C NDE       8/8/2010.      NDE 4541.             I clearly remember seeing myself walking through a tunnel. While I walked, well, it was like floating more than walking, I felt peace, no worries, angelical music, and a bright clear light like a star, like a diamond. At the end of the tunnel there was this man, he looked just like the pictures we see here of Jesus. He took me by my hand and said to me, 'This is not you time.'  
   NDE due to brain hemorrhage.   

    2286.        Scott R Probable NDE       8/8/2010.      Probable NDE 4538.             I experienced civil war soldiers marching along a long walkway upwards. I was told that it was not my time to go. My feeling was of purgatory or hell. But there was more too.  It that I cannot put to words. It was as though I had more to do and to prove my worthiness.  
   Probable NDE due to injury from an exploding water main.   

    2285.        Connie P NDE       8/8/2010.      NDE 4536.       From the UK.      I see the grass - it's incredibly lush and green - and I know it is late spring or early summer. I know the air is full of pollen and the flowers are blooming. It's warm and the sun is brilliant. I see the skirt, all the way down to the ground, as the woman walks towards me. I look up very slowly and see her face. I see and feel nothing but love, peace and understanding.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest during surgery.   

    2284.        Rachel L Probable NDE       8/8/2010.      Probable NDE 4535.             When I blacked out, I began to fly or fall down a flight of stairs into a wall, and right before I hit the wall I immediately stopped before impact. I began to float and found myself in an old English pub, dimly lit, with an old bartender wiping down glasses. He nodded to acknowledge my presence, and then I woke up to a doctor saying, 'Welcome back'.  
   Probable NDE due to septic shock with atypical content.   

    2283.        Dick M NDE       8/8/2010.      NDE 4534.             I turned or was turned away and found myself in a 'tunnel' of light, bright but at the same time 'soft' around the edges. I was proceeding down (or up) through this tunnel and I saw a figure, not describable, and this figure said, 'Go back; it's not your time.' I did not want to go back and the voice repeated 'Go back. It is not your time.' Then the voice said 'You have had enough.' I knew that the voice meant alcohol.  
   NDE due to alcohol overdose.  After NDE, he no longer drank alcohol.   

    2282.        Johnny H NDE       8/8/2010.      NDE 4526.             I saw my grandmother, grandfather and two uncles that had passed. It was in an area with green grass and a wooded background.  My grandfather and two uncles were a chrome swing with purple seats. My grandmother was standing with one seat on the swing with no one in it; I tried to get in the swing seat but could not. I ask my grandmother to help me on the swing and she said no that I could not stay I had to go home. I could smell my grandmother's perfume something I had not smelled in twenty-seven years and my grandfather's laugh.  
   NDE due to accident.   

    2281.        Robin W FDE       8/8/2010.      FDE 4525.             I felt as if I was looking at the steering wheel turning one direction and then the other at a fast speed. I could see the steering wheel from above and see myself in the driver's seat. The most profound thing I remember is the sense of utter peace and joy - a feeling that is truly indescribable - and one I have never had since. It was a calm joy and happiness, as I watched from above.  
   Fear-Death Experience immediately prior to auto accident.   

    2280.        Sally L Probable NDE       8/8/2010.      Probable NDE 4522.             As I drifted, I felt so peaceful and LOVED. I smelled roses before I got there. When I looked around, I saw the rose garden with every different color you could think of. I was in a place that was bright with glowing light.  There was love all around me. I heard music and angels singing. A tall man came and asked me if I wanted to go on or back. I think he asked me twice. I said I want to go back. I think I must have been told I would get married and start a family. I might have wanted to stay otherwise. It was so beautiful. I know it was heaven. I was scared to die until then. I will never forget the place of unconditional love.  
   Probable NDE due to anesthetic complication   

    2279.        Michael A NDE       8/8/2010.      NDE 4521.             I was already looking down on myself. I pulled out of my body at the time the board was placed under me. All of a sudden, I was back in my body looking down at my feet.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest. He is blind, and was partially blind at the time of this experience.   

    2278.        Kathy W Probable NDE       8/8/2010.      Probable NDE 4520.             There was a figure sitting under an enormous tree and other small figures, children, were gathered around. The figure (male) - (funny I don't remember a race or hair color just illuminating light) had a pure white robe on. It was not the man Jesus, but He was God/Creator. Others would probably have thought of Him as Jesus. He told me without words to come to Him. I went to Him, He was familiar, and He held me and comforted me. I have never felt so safe, loved unconditionally and the pain - it was gone!! Oh, and that lovely sweet scent - roses, lily of the valley - like every flower in the world surrendered one note of its being to create the perfect scent.  
   Probable NDE at age three due to illness.   

    2277.        Dorothy T NDEs       8/8/2010.      NDEs 4517.       From Canada.      The second time, like the first, I found myself in a tunnel of sorts. It was made up of light. If I looked directly up I could see that the light was made of many, many colors, (at age 6, I didn't know about spectrums) but the light ahead and around me was white, beyond white, beyond anything that can be described as white. I remember thinking 'I'm back' and feeling relief.    
   Two NDEs. One at age six due to blood loss and another at age twenty-three due to coma.   

    2276.        Debra B NDE       8/8/2010.      NDE 4516.             I feel this floating sensation - I wasn't in my body. Next, it was really dark, like a tunnel floating toward this light and as I was floating further on the light was getting bigger and brighter. Next, I saw my mom (she died in 2000) and she was standing in front of the light. She was wearing this white gown and it looked as if she was glowing. She had her head down and her eyes up staring at me and we were communicating in our minds. It was as if we could read each other's thoughts!  
   NDE due to head injury (thrown from car).   

    2275.        Lisa T Probable NDE       8/8/2010.      Probable NDE 4515.             I can remember the light and I heard voices but the voices were drowned out by a baby crying - I think the baby was my cousin's son who had died. Shortly after this happened I had a dream that my mom was holding that baby showing him to me.  
   Probable NDE due to suicide attempt with drug overdose.   

    2274.        JM Probable NDE       8/8/2010.      Probable NDE 4527.       From the UK.      After the 'film' finished, there was a lot of discussion (which I did not really seem to be part of) about whether I had 'followed' my life path and overcome the tasks set to me. After some debate the consensus was that I had not and I was informed that I was to be 'sent' back for another try.  This time, I would need to make some changes and put my life on a different track. I was escorted by one of the members of the 'council' out of the clearing to an area, which was quite non-descript in appearance, like being surrounded in a kind of mist. The mist grew more intense until I dissolved into it.  
   Probable NDE while undergoing surgery.   

    2273.        Maurice B NDE       8/7/2010.      NDE 4687.       From France. Original in French, translated to English by Magalie.      I could hear myself calling to my wife and then, I emerged from my body which was crumbled on the floor like a blanket. I was in absolute darkness and I was coming near a bright and intense white light. Suddenly, I came back into my body and it felt as if I was sucked back in it. The shower head had fallen into the bath, the water was sprinkling on my lower abdomen and it felt as if I was urinating on myself. I woke up, lying on the floor, with my head against my chest. My wife turned off the water so it wouldn't flood the bathroom.  
   NDE from pain-related unconsciousness.   

    2272.        Alexandra S NDE       7/1/2014 & 8/7/2010.      NDE 7282/4680.       From France.  Original in French, translated to English by Kathy & Marguy.      I was thinking of many things at once: of my parents, of my life, of the life that I would have had. Then I had a feeling of leaving my body, of floating. I could see my body curled up in the shower. I could see everything. I could hear everything but I was looking at my body. I only had eyes, no body and I could feel myself rising, rising then the black hole.  
   NDE from electrocution.   

    2271.        Misericordia AC Probable NDE       8/7/2010.      Probable NDE 4695.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon.      I saw a tunnel with a light, which drew me towards it. I could see myself in silhouette, going towards it. I saw Jesus, young and with a beard, as I have since seen him in the image of the Divine Mercy. He was saying, 'Come.' I saw some moments from my life, which caused me to feel repentance. I said to him, 'Not yet, give me more time to repent.' I heard, within myself, 'Everything you have confessed is already forgiven and forgotten.' Then I could hear my father's prayer for me, saying it was not yet time for me to die.  
   Probable NDE from pneumonia.   

    2270.        Roselyne L Possible NDE       7/29/2010.      Possible NDE 4678.       From France. Original in French, translated to English by Kathy.      Then, I saw. I was above the operating table! And my body was floating in a tunnel, at the end was a light that was growing bigger, I could see shadows at the end of this light and my body stopped floating, I was content, I felt like continuing on my way. But a voice told me I had to go back, that I was needed. When I came to a pain, ripped my body, I felt like I was in a vice and that someone was pushing on my stomach, and at every pressure, I heard music, a tango, and with each rhythm of this tango, pain in my stomach and chest. Then I heard nothing.  
   Possible NDE due to childbirth complications. Non-clear life-threatening event.   

    2269.        Charlie D NDE       7/25/2010.      NDE 4510.             I seemed to drift away and then suddenly, I accelerated not with my body but with my spirit or essence. I went up through the ceiling, into a path/tunnel that led to an all-knowing, all-loving, comforting, and peaceful light.  This light was a familiar, yet embracing light. The tunnel/path had silhouettes of beings on the other side of some undefined boundary I could hear sounds but not intelligible. This place was free of pain and I felt I was one with all. I had arrived to a place without pain. My vision was 360 degrees it was profoundly beautiful.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest following car accident.   

    2268.        Helen D NDE       7/25/2010.      NDE 4507.             They said they couldn't answer everything for me at this time, they said to try to explain would be difficult, beyond us, because what we humans think is only an ant-like piece of what it all is and means. They did answer the religion question. They said there is no right or wrong religion. It is what is in your heart that counts. They also said that our purpose on this earth is to love.  
   NDE at age nine due to drowning.   

    2267.        Mary S NDE       7/25/2010.      NDE 4506.             Then all of a sudden, such peace came over me it was wonderful. I could see my arms floating in the water - I was above. A lifeguard finally got to me (I don't remember this part) but when he got me out of the water I could see my body in his arms. My swimsuit top was pulled up and I saw him pull it down for me. (Later this was verified.)  
   NDE at age ten due to drowning.   

    2266.        Frederick F NDE       7/25/2010.      NDE 4505.             Then my grandfather met me.  I was so happy to see him! He had already died, but he was as real when he was alive. I am still in shock today but it is and still is wonderful to dream and remember the experience. My grandfather was wearing a long white robe that almost glowed or was illuminated with the whitest white you could believe. There were a lot of other men and women wearing the same robes and they were talking to people. Some had street clothes on and some had something like a spirit-like cloaking that was also beautiful. While we talked and walked in this beautiful valley, he told me that I could not stay and this was my preview of what was to come, that he loved me very much, and that my time was up.  
   NDE during surgery.   

    2265.        Nettie P NDE       7/19/2010.      NDE 4503.             I had a terrible childbirth that should have been a cesarean section, but when the doctor arrived and realized it was too late, and both the baby and I were already in danger. It was too late for a cesarean section so they did a quick forceps delivery and apparently, I was 'dead' at the time. I clearly remember floating above and watching them work on my son to get him breathing, cleaning him up and passing him from relative to relative while they worked on me, and I kept asking people to hand me my baby but nobody answered me. The following day they gave me three units of blood when they realized they had not given me any transfusions and I could not sit up without fainting. My mother insisted I had not been speaking to anyone and could not have seen anyone doing anything to my son because I had been 'dead' at the time.  
   NDE at time of delivery.   

    2264.        Heather M NDE       7/19/2010.      NDE 4501.             I left my body and saw myself seizing including graphic physical unpleasant visualizations. I was tied up. I was told while I was unconscious, to envision a rope and climb up it. I pictured myself at the bottom of a deep pit, or black tunnel with a light at the top. I pictured a rope and physically felt as if I was climbing up it toward the light (life.) I did also feel the general impression it was a choice to do so. When I reached the top, I regained consciousness.  
   NDE due to cocaine use with seizure.  Atypical content.   

    2263.        Anne O Probable NDE       7/19/2010.      Probable NDE 4495.       From Canada.      I didn't feel sad while looking at the scene, no feeling whatsoever. I then found myself in a very bright place, outdoors; I remember a very blue sky, and a large, bright gold gate with extending fence as far as I could see. There was a table in front of me with two people standing behind it, they looked at me then down at the table and told me I couldn't stay. There was no question about my destiny, I had no choice, and I understood.  
   Probable NDE at age six or seven due to scarlet fever. Shared seventy-five years later.   

    2262.        Mark H NDE       7/19/2010.      NDE 4494.             I just kept wanting to tell him that 'I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm up here,' but he never looked up. It was frustrating that I couldn't tell them, because I thought if they knew I was fine, they wouldn't worry about me down there anymore. Then as he was slapping me, I started to move slowly towards my body. I remember like it was today that I said 'No, no, no!' many times, but you can't really talk. I was going back very slowly and all I could think of was 'No!' This may sound crazy, but as I got down to the floor, I actually laid by myself head-to-head and toe-to-toe and 'slid' back inside. I remember it so well and then I woke up as he was yelling my name.  
   NDE at approximately age ten due to apparent head injury.   

    2261.        Norbeto G NDE       7/19/2010.      NDE 4664.       From Columbia. Original in Spanish, translated by English by Simon.      I felt myself immersed in an absolutely unfamiliar space. I recall a great clarity, where there was no light, but where I was the light. I could not hear music, but I was the music. Nor did I perceive harmony and peace, but I was exactly those things. The overall feeling was of being part of a Great Whole, where what existed was the Universe without stars, but where everything was light, joy, and love.  
   NDE from accident.   

    2260.        Patrick H NDE       7/17/2010.      NDE 4674.       From Luxembourg. Original in French, translated by English by Kathy.      When I told Saint Peter that I hadn't gone through anything strange, and that my parents had mistreated and neglected me, I still don't know how I came up with such precise words, he said he understood why I felt like staying, he told me I had to protect my big brother and a little sister yet to be born. Then he bade me farewell and I went down again at an incredible speed for about a minute.  
   NDE at age two who was blind at the time.
