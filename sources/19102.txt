uh so this is uh really going to be an
exciting afternoon because what we&#39;re
going to go through
uh
is
really
deep understanding
of what
the applications are to what you learned
last night
how many people were able to meditate
this morning some
and did anyone everyone feel that they
could get into this quiet state an
expanded state some
see how many people
yeah maybe half two-thirds
uh it&#39;s also fun to do it in water so if
you sit in the pools or sort of and and
just sit and meditate there&#39;s a hot tub
where i&#39;m staying that i did that in
yesterday afternoon
it&#39;s it&#39;s just very relaxing
and just enjoy it make have fun with it
what this session is about is taking the
understanding and the experience you&#39;re
beginning to have
in meditative states
remembering that meditative states
uh
are really for the purpose of
experiencing the true nature of what&#39;s
already there
it&#39;s really about allowing yourself
to get out of the way of yourself
does this make sense
and
it reminds me of this great story from
the
ancient sufi tradition where
there was a a master teaching his
students how to uh walk on water
and levitate across the water
and there was a guy there and he was
going uh
i&#39;m afraid of drowning and i&#39;m heavier
than the water and i&#39;m going to get out
there and sink and this and that and the
other thing and it was all ego and fear
and fear and ego and ego and fear and
more fear and ego
and the master turned to him and said
leave thyself behind
and then walk upon the water
so you leave yourself behind
and then do anything it&#39;s the zen
of meditation it&#39;s the zen of contact
and it&#39;s also the zen of remote viewing
it&#39;s incredibly easy if you&#39;re child
like
and playful with it and just let it flow
as opposed to being so serious and
diligent we&#39;re going to be very serious
and deal because we&#39;re adults now
so there&#39;s a childlike playfulness with
this that needs to come into it where
you can just say oh i can do this
because you can and if you believe you
can you will and it&#39;s interesting
because uh what they&#39;ve done with random
number generators
uh where they&#39;re spitting out zeros and
ones in a 50 50 distribution under
random conditions when people put their
awareness on it
and they just go wow this is cool
there&#39;ll be this huge spike
consistently way against any
probabilities and say a zero or one
depending what they&#39;re intending but the
next time the person tries in many cases
because they then the ego kicks in and
goes wow i can do this and then and then
they intellectualize it
it plummets
why is that it&#39;s because the self
the ego has gotten in the way of the
flow consciousness does this make sense
all right get it
so same thing with ce5
when you&#39;re making contact and
communicating with these interstellar
civilizations
there is there&#39;s sort of a grace and a
zen of doing it where you just know you
can do it and if you believe you can do
it you will
and if the ego kicks in and you start
intellectualizing it and editorializing
it
it blocks that flow of non-locality
and the same thing for remote viewing
if i want to remote view my
youngest daughter and
and wife right now in richmond
i just click into and see where they are
and i know what they&#39;re you know just
boom it&#39;s easy simple
yeah oh yes in real time on the fly
driving down the highway we&#39;re the
police
haven&#39;t had a ticket in 30 or 40 years
to just click
like virginia you&#39;re talking fascistic
you know we&#39;re talking the fascistic
state of virginia well we had a rental
property in richmond
and there were some college dudes who
were renting it smoked a joint they came
in with a swat team tore the whole door
apart i got a notice listen to this
about governmental fascistic behavior
emily and i got a notice
that we
would be arrested
if anyone smoked in one of our rental
properties again
pot
because we were the owners of the
property and we were facilitating drug
use this in the city of richmond in
virginia i&#39;m talking about jack-booted
thugs
so don&#39;t get me started about this kind
of stuff but
you know i need a serious xm channel and
unplug me it won&#39;t be purdy
all right
yeah
so uh
no but you can use this anytime anywhere
and this is this is what&#39;s beautiful
about the understanding of it and one of
the one of the stories i like to tell is
um the the
near-death experience i had
and afterwards i went gosh there&#39;s got
to be a way to have that cosmic
consciousness experience
without having to die
you know i said you know it was great
that i died and
came back i guess um although i&#39;d prefer
to stay out where i was it was so
beautiful
beautiful
but
to be on this plane in the material
world at this time in human evolution
stuck in a reductionist material
you know
brutalized world of industrial schlock
wasn&#39;t great and i i wasn&#39;t happy about
it and so i said i need to find a way to
get back to that so i started searching
for things and i found this meditation
course and i&#39;ll never forget the guy did
the puja and we sit down
and
we&#39;re sitting
and
he gives me the mantra
different from the one i gave you guys
when i gave you the very advanced one
and
i&#39;m there in this quiet state
and go into and i just transcend
into pure consciousness and i completely
transcended
everything receded and i went into this
pure unbounded mind it was so beautiful
and blissful
and after and afterwards he says okay
let&#39;s open the eyes and he looked at me
he says you transcended didn&#39;t you and
i&#39;m eight i just this is on my 18th
birthday june 28 1973
and and and he i go wasn&#39;t what we were
supposed to do
i see i didn&#39;t i hadn&#39;t over thought it
to the point that i had to make this a
big gashrai
you know like some kind of a you know a
huge big deal about it i just thought
well yeah this is normal this is natural
why not sit and do it
and so most people overthink it but also
they don&#39;t believe they can do it and
that&#39;s the beginning of
programming yourself for failure so what
we want to do is hit the reset button
reprogram ourselves for success for
being able to do it and if you believe
you can do it you will and all i&#39;m going
to do is help you remember
who you really are
and give you some techniques that
facilitate the sharpening of that
ability
that&#39;s really all i can do the rest
you&#39;re doing yourself
but this one i&#39;m sharing right now is
key to understanding
the psychological and even physical
dynamics of consciousness and
non-locality and how it can be
manifested
whatever the city is
s-i-d-d-h-i-s
the cities
whether it&#39;s remote viewing which is a
pop culture term for an ancient
the ability to be a seer of a remote
place or a remote time into the future
or
levitation or materializing objects or
communicating with interstellar
civilizations and having contact these
are all cities
and they&#39;re all easily accomplished if
you understand the science and the
fundamental knowledge of consciousness
it&#39;s nature
and how you begin to manifest it
by basically
being childlike and letting it flow
through you and having fun with it
and knowing you can do it
as soon as you accept that and get out
of the grim i don&#39;t know
i&#39;m not ingo swann and i can&#39;t do that
you know if you&#39;re programmed that way
and you believe that about yourself
there&#39;s nothing i can do to help you
so
empower yourself to be who you are and
that is
uh
become
the person that you actually are and let
this other rubbish fall away leave
yourself this kind of stuff of yourself
behind and walk upon the water and let&#39;s
fly together right
all right yeah
so that&#39;s
that&#39;s an important dynamic and uh
if you take nothing away from this
entire weekend besides these techniques
and what i just said
it will hold you in very good stead
and there are enormous practical
implications for this um
how many people in here are medical
doctors or are what i call critical
like pilots airline pilots doctors i&#39;m
just
life and death special forces folks
er nurse love you
my knee our nurse love them love them
love them love them they&#39;re awesome
worth their weight in uber platinum
believe me believe me
when i left the hospital where i was and
chairman the nurses all wept because we
were such a team and i was kind of when
the really
nasty surgeons and orthopedic people
would abuse them i&#39;d go in there and
just stand behind them and go
leave my nurses alone and this one
little one had a bad case of lms
which is little man syndrome
uh
i literally picked him up
ejecting him out of the room anyway
chairman of surgery anyway so
nurses are awesome so those of you who
are in critical remember that
there&#39;s science
and there&#39;s objective knowledge and
intellect
and then there&#39;s the consciousness that
can sense and feel and know and if you
develop this ability you will save lives
more lives
and in your normal everyday work whoever
you are i mean if you&#39;re a teacher and
you&#39;re dealing with a student
intuiting what that person needs and
what you need to teach and do
there&#39;s a level where we have our
intellect and scientific knowledge which
is totally valid but it can be greatly
augmented by the primary
operating system we have and this this
expanded aspect of consciousness
and i remember the time there was a 26
year old male that came into the er with
um the flu
he had all the symptoms i see the flu in
parentheses
and he had all the symptoms of the flu
and fever chills he had nauseated and
myalgias and
and it was flu season so the nurse put
him in a regular room because he had a
bad flu ah some amantadine and out the
door you go
um
otd out the door
i went in there and you know how golden
retrievers can kind of have been trained
to pick up melanomas and stuff i&#39;m kind
of like that so
i went in there and i saw
felt sense in his head
a brain tumor
and you can&#39;t just blurt that out to
someone with no objective findings or no
objective find there&#39;s no neurological
findings nothing
and so
i ordered thank god i didn&#39;t have to go
to the
medical
nazis and gatekeepers in the government
and insurance companies i just turned to
the nurse and i said i need a stat ct of
the head cat scan of the head
and it was great it was it was this
country nurse who went well dr greer he
only has the flu
and i said
and her name was bubbles we call her
bubbles i said bubbles just do it
and so they did and i explained that
there&#39;s just some things i wanted to
check out i was you know very
well the radiologists usually you know
were very slow to get back to unless it
was something really bad and critical
and i get a call back
emergency call back from the radiologist
uh he has a massive astrocytoma
which a type of brain tumor that was
like a pancake between the skull and on
top of the brain but he&#39;d crawl so much
pressure it was he was herniating his
brain stem causing his fever hitting the
chemotactic trigger zone for nausea and
vomiting
and everything else we had no focal
neurological findings pupils
function motor sensory it was just that
so it masked as a flu
and if i had sent him out the door
he probably would have herniated and
died within a day or two
and he went to emergency neurosurgery
and is alive now and fine he used to
come in you know months later and with
his kids he had two children and the
neurosurgeon interestingly called me and
said
uh hey steve what how
why did you even get a cat scan on this
guy i wouldn&#39;t even have thought to get
a cat scan on him i said well i just had
a hunch
i couldn&#39;t tell him that i had remote
viewed a brain tumor
i mean i&#39;d lose my license
but this is what we need to be teaching
our children
and our you know doctors and our phd
people so that we don&#39;t say
you know it&#39;s not a choice it&#39;s not this
uh this
ridiculous choice people make it&#39;s
either between science and objective
means of of exploration and knowledge or
consciousness development and intuition
it&#39;s both together and when you put both
together
you know that&#39;s who you want to have as
your physician
or your pilot
or your whoever so this has enormous
practical applications above and beyond
or maybe not above and beyond but in
addition to being ambassador to the
universe because if you develop this
capability it&#39;s going to inform and
influence every part of your life no
matter what you&#39;re doing
no matter how trivial and mundane it may
seem to be
um
or you know another a few years ago i
was driving through
around glacier national park
and i was going
near helena
and i&#39;m driving along the highway
and almost like an override vision came
into my my mind
why is there oh i&#39;m not meditating boom
two cars in an intersection with a
really horrific accident
about
45 minutes an hour later i came to a
four-way stop like they have all around
here very dangerous intersections by the
way
out in the country of uh
and
there was a suv a suburban that had run
through a stop sign and broadsided ford
taurus and tourists who had come in from
germany who were going to glacier
national park both of them were dead on
the scene immediately
and the others were close to that and i
was the first person to get upon this
accident now i was so convinced i was
going to come across this i started
looking around the car for straws
bandages rags clothes anything i would
have because i knew that this was going
to happen and it did and so anyway we
got the helicopters in and i was there
with the paramedics and the other two
people lived but that that is just one
example and and i could give you
thousands of examples like that and it
isn&#39;t that you know this isn&#39;t something
everyone can begin to do where you
function in an awake state
and it has implications for
avoiding disasters
or having wonderful things happen or
being just
incredibly efficient and effective in
what you&#39;re doing in your day-to-day
work and life but when you&#39;re talking
about interstellar contact
see they&#39;re operating on that level all
the time
because they&#39;re civilizations that have
existed that where they&#39;ve had complete
abundance
let&#39;s let&#39;s talk let&#39;s back this up for
a minute
we&#39;re working and i&#39;ve actually out here
had about half a dozen meetings with
high net worth corporations and people
seriously interested
in funding and moving forward with free
energy zero point energy
stuff amazing
and
let&#39;s say that in a generation
there is no more poverty on the earth
and pollution it&#39;s just like a nightmare
i mean it&#39;s like
the you know the era of uh slavery or
the stone age or whatever
or the inquisition
all that becomes a historical footnote
and our civilization is functioning the
way it should have been for the last 100
years what i call this lost century
with that level of abundance
and no pollution or footprint on gaia
will be very gentle because it&#39;ll be 100
recycling and eventually we&#39;ll get to
what i call trans-dimensional
manufacturing
do you want to know how ets make things
should we get into that because this is
actually a consciousness assisted
technology
so
you know
this microphone and all this stuff has
been we cut down a tree for this
the metal was dug out of the earth
you know neanderthal like
and it&#39;s melted down made into metal
and then it&#39;s riveted together in bolts
and screws
trans-dimensional interstellar
civilizations which means the ones that
are here
and have exceeded the speed of light
have mastered the sciences of
trans-dimensional
manufacturing to wit
they are able
to create a standing resonant
sonic
energy field
that is almost like an architectural
blueprint of something like 3d printing
but this is like four or five d printing
get it
and in that resonant field
then
materialize
the object the spacecraft the piece of
clothing
from
the trans-dimensional
interface energetic interface
with
the subatomic
space-time matter
so that the molecules the atoms the
structures everything in that is coming
out in is coming through into this
dimension of
from that deeper interface
from another dimension an energy field
and it just materializes it now the word
materializes no one thinks what that
means it&#39;s to make material but you&#39;re
assembling it from these elementals i
call them the elementals that are
sub-sub-sub-sub-atomic and then weigh in
past the even zero-point energy field
which is infinite energy as tesla said
the direct sea as professor direct said
but in that pluripotent state
you can recruit pure gold
pure platinum
iron any metal and biologicals what have
you so
you can then
manifest that
and
what you have just heard i would say a
handful of people on earth know even in
classified projects it&#39;s highly
compartmented this is really way past ts
sci
top secret special
compartmented intelligence
but that&#39;s how they happen and this is
why you know when occasionally after
we&#39;ve hit a scalar weapon
electromagnetic weapon and made one of
these craft crash
and downed them by the way we&#39;ve been
doing that the early testing of it was
roswell
that that spacecraft or two of them that
crashed was the result of a quote radar
dome this fbi document that we got and
put out which is now the number one
viewed document on the fbi website
um now and it&#39;s an official document
from a field agent writing to jager
hoover talking about what happened at
roswell and that apparently it crashed
because
of a new radar system we put in well i
can assure you that an interstellar
vehicle and there are two of them who
are doing surveillance of our only
atomic bomb
squadron in the world which is where
roswell was at the time in 1947
doesn&#39;t crash because we have a new
radar system it was a radar system that
had embedded in it a longitudinal scaler
faster than the speed of light weapon
system
which we&#39;ll get into if you want to hear
the if you&#39;re a physicist won&#39;t talk to
me but most people basically
the light you&#39;re looking at is a wave
you know that a laser is like a green
laser is that wave length all
synchronized
coherently coherent light
longitudinal electromagnetic systems are
a point and longitudinal there&#39;s no wave
component
and there are multiples of the speed of
light and that has been weaponized
got it
so that&#39;s what happened at roswell
um
and has then been developed and deployed
and by 1965 we&#39;re on platforms in space
targeting interstellar vehicles and
downing them that&#39;s why there have been
many of them that have crashed they
don&#39;t you know these things don&#39;t come
through intergalactic space and go oops
i can&#39;t really navigate the jet stream
and crash in the the andes
all right
so between 1965
and 19 i&#39;d say 95 or so and that 30
years there was an there&#39;s a
geosynchronous
satellite net
with detector systems
that then track and target
interstellar vehicles
and can down them now of course you know
the kill rate use a terrible term
military term isn&#39;t 100 percent
but it&#39;s very dangerous
um and so this is what&#39;s out of control
in the deep black projects at the
pentagon dia saic egng raytheon
i know the guys who worked on this
system i&#39;m not speculating here
so
this then
you have to understand that what i&#39;m
talking about the et
civilizations visiting here
might be very reluctant to interface too
overtly in 3d because once they come out
of
once they step down
the resonant frequency from
transdimensional
fields into 3d space-time
they&#39;re basically like shooting fish in
a barrel
at this point and we need to stand those
systems down
and that&#39;s what i&#39;ve been asking my
medium actually the central purpose of
my meeting with the general who&#39;s in
charge of the defense intelligence
agency
was to ask him to work to do that but he
was not
briefed or read into those projects and
had no access to them they were beyond
the reach of the head of the defense
intelligence agency which is basically
the a big operation like the cia but
it&#39;s within the pentagon
um
is this
how you all heard this before anyway i
don&#39;t know how much of this you&#39;ve heard
but it&#39;s very important for you to
understand the media we&#39;re operating in
but going back to this concept of
consciousness assisted technology so if
you&#39;re connected and you see
what you want to manifest you can
connect to a
technology that creates this resonant
and sonic deep sonic field that then
materializes that object
so not initially but say you know i
don&#39;t know how many years into the
future
we&#39;re not even going to need to be
having mining operations
or manufacturing
or anything that damages the earth it
will simply be this kind of
high-tech
4d
5d manufacturing forget 3d manufacturing
so
this is this is how they&#39;re doing it now
a very comical i just insert a comic
relief that kind of makes this very real
for people i don&#39;t know if this is too
abstract
or i&#39;m trying to articulate something
that&#39;s a very advanced science and lay
term so that you can follow it do most
people follow what i just shared yeah
okay
at the end of this session we&#39;re going
to have a question and answer you can
drill down with your questions we can
clarify
we&#39;re going to try to take about an hour
for question and answer today this
afternoon
um
if we have another mic if not you just
shout it out and i&#39;ll repeat it
so there is this man and jack valet
actually reported this in a book but he
had a third hand account
and back in the early 60s there was a
gentleman
who was a captain of a contract vessel
for the navy
in the south atlantic where we were
testing our intercontinental ballistic
missiles
and so we were firing them down down uh
range
and
he his ship was to go in there and
retrieve them and then mark where they
hit and see how accurate their guidance
systems were for hitting a target
when we were trying to perfect these are
hydrogen bomb delivery uh
you know the the missiles
that are hydrogen bombs and uh this this
man
was on a
the captain of this contract vessel was
equipped with brand new radar systems
and what have you for tracking the
missiles well they kept having
e.t craft show up on it
and
this at this one point um it was one
evening
there was one on radar
and his guy called him and says look
i&#39;ve got a
an unknown here on
radar
and they called it into their control
center which unfortunately gave the
military the ability to triangulate
location
and they hit this object with one of
these scalar weapons and it dropped he
said they saw it drop just like a rock
straight into the ocean
so he was vectored into the point of
impact of this et vehicle
and got there first
and there were um
the only thing left on the surface of
the ocean
was about a six-foot
ejection pod
and when they got it open
there were four
uh extraterrestrial
biological
life forms human beings people in it and
the rest of the craft had gone all the
way down to the bottom of the ocean
which apparently was thousands of feet
deep in that area
whether they retrieved that i&#39;m sure at
some point they did
so he was ordered to take it on board
and put the bodies in the ship&#39;s freezer
um but but he started describing these
little beans to me so well they were 39
inches tall
about a meter very precise
um they had the skin of a sicilian i&#39;m
quoting i&#39;m not trying to be racist or
ethnic or either or this is an old you
know
captain
dude you know a salty guy
and
they had a very attractive they were he
said they were handsome little men
but they had no hair and no pinna
this is the pinna are chimpanzee ears
you like monkeys
we&#39;re monkeys you&#39;ll see
they didn&#39;t have pinna but openings and
they had a very fine sort of mouth and a
very slight nose
very uh
you know but he said they were quite
attractive and and beautiful eyes
almond-shaped eyes um white with a
a dark center
uh but they were all dead unfortunately
and uh
and you&#39;re saying what does this story
have to do with what i was just sharing
with you about consciousness assisted
technology and interstellar
manufacturing
the reason this man called me
and jack vale never got a chance to
actually talk to the to the captain of
the ship he heard it i think third hand
and headed in his book a passport to
magol whatever it was
passport to something
yeah magonia
well
this man was so freaked out not by i
mean of course
he was freaked out by the fact that
there were et&#39;s he didn&#39;t know that at
the time and then a bunch of badass
people came up in a submarine
and surfaced by a ship and came on board
and threatened everyone on the ship with
death termination if they spoke of this
so much so that even when he had to have
surgery at one point and some intel
person went into surgery after when he
got anesthesia to be sure he didn&#39;t
speak of this
that&#39;s the folks i work with i have
several hundred men and women a few
women like that in my network but he was
too afraid to come forward publicly he
was convinced he&#39;d be
terminated i told him he wouldn&#39;t be
but you know i can&#39;t force someone to
take that risk
so
and i said well that&#39;s all very i&#39;m glad
to have this information he says but
that&#39;s not why i called
i said earlier why&#39;d you call
and he said well
i thought you might be the guy who can
answer something that&#39;s been bugging me
for 30 years
30-some years this was back in the 90s
i said well what&#39;s that he says
these handsome little men
had metallicized uniforms on
and we couldn&#39;t get them off
there were no zippers and there are no
buttons and there was no way to put them
on or off
i said well no they don&#39;t need zippers
and buttons because they use a sonic
field
that is created and i beg and that&#39;s
described but i just described all of
you about how interstellar
extraterrestrial civilizations that are
transdimensional
and interstellar and can go from one
star system to here on earth manufacture
things
and i went very carefully through and he
says oh my god that&#39;s the only thing
that makes sense
and that&#39;s the only reason he called me
because this had been bugging him for 30
some years how the hell did they put
these suits on and off so it&#39;s these
little things that stick in your mind if
you&#39;re in a special operation like that
because it didn&#39;t make any sense he
could he&#39;d get his mind around the fact
that we&#39;re et craft he could get his
mind around the fact there were
different people in the cosmos he&#39;d kind
of looked into that after this happened
he couldn&#39;t wrap his mind around how
these damn uniforms were put on and off
but now you know
and so does everyone listening
so memo to silicon valley you want to
really do some high-tech stuff
give me a jingle
seriousdisclosure.com
send a message we&#39;ll do it with by the
time my grandchildren are
in in one generation we&#39;ll have a
civilization that you won&#39;t look
anything like ours
let&#39;s do it
you know because i&#39;m a pretty old guy
now i mean i started this project when i
was a young whippersnapper and 35 years
old i was talking to michael
the other night it&#39;s kind of emotional
imagine being 38 years old briefing the
director of the cia on this stuff
yeah oh that&#39;s a heavy lift for a
30-something so you know a heavy lift
like you don&#39;t know what happened at
that meeting but so you know we have to
figure out how to move this or i have to
pass this on to a generation because you
know i won&#39;t be around for more than
another 30 or 40 years
we don&#39;t have 30 or 40 years anyway you
know we got to get this done sooner
but we need people to understand what
the sciences are
and also what the interface is between
consciousness and mass consciousness
making smooth this transition
because this is the biggest change
in the history of the human race and the
reason the remote view what i&#39;m going to
teach you some of these techniques the
reason it&#39;s so important that you
understand the power
of the meditative state that when an
individual plugs into this expanded
state of consciousness but with other
people
that they are harmonically
friendly loving unified with the effect
is exponential
versus one person
and they&#39;ve done this again with the
random number generator experiments for
example if they have one person putting
their awareness and intending it to spit
out more ones and zeros there&#39;s a
certain effect if there are two people
that love each other or that are friends
and connected and they do it it&#39;s not
twice as much it&#39;s exponentially ten
times as much or whatever and they&#39;ve
documented this so imagine when there
are hundreds of people like we have here
and thousands listening
doing the meditation we did last night
for the healing of the earth or on these
long one-week trainings i take people to
the point where we go into the command
center
of the cube at lockheed martin skunk
works up here in the desert or the
uh majority committee on intelligence
the so-called majestic group and i named
them and i named the facilities and all
the underground bases and we go to them
one by one by one putting infinite love
and infinite forgiveness and infinite
light and this higher consciousness into
every heart and soul
that&#39;s what we do
no no anger no hate forget that that&#39;s
the old you&#39;re not
no problems ever saw by the
consciousness that created it don&#39;t
approach this from the point of anger
and hate now you can be strong
and you can be a spirit warrior
and don&#39;t be a wimp have courage
but don&#39;t give in
i sound like a star wars
freak don&#39;t give in to the to the dark
side of that you know
uh
at the door
luke
so you you want to stay with that that
positive life-giving energy even when
you&#39;re dealing with people who are in
these special operations and that&#39;s how
i how i roll
um without fear and without hate and
with full forgiveness and understanding
now i mean some people are just
sociopathic or psychopathic enough
they&#39;re refractory to everything and
those are the hard-liners in this group
but through what we&#39;ve been doing with
the disclosure project and our mass
meditations and our contact
when i first briefed the director of the
cia
only about a third of this group was in
favor
of anything i was suggesting
now it&#39;s 70 percent
it&#39;s a big
now the other 30 25 30 percent are the
hardcore
psychopath sociopaths that just don&#39;t
flat out kill and eat their own
and that&#39;s unfortunately what happened
to bill colby the ci director who was
helping me
um
in the 90s when he was going to hand off
a free energy device and
some
not a small amount a
moderate amount of of seed funding
around 50 million dollars to get the
technology out to the public massively
disclose it
and the week he was going to meet with a
member of my board they found him
floating down the potomac river
and
if the problem with that is that he
was not known to me at the time that he
was killed i was only it was a blind
date
and therefore we could not extend
disclosure protection to him
friends let me listen carefully in one
anyone
listening
do not think you&#39;re going to be off the
radar of the sector of the intelligence
committee working task with this issue
no level of encryption no level of
patents no level of spy versus spy
talking in gibberish code over a phone
is going to frustrate their knowing
everything you&#39;re doing in real time
and the only protection there is is
strategic protection which is massive
disclosure and public transparency of
everything you are doing
the quickest way to get killed doing
this stuff is to do it secretively
if you do it in full view
you&#39;re completely safe why
because the people who are in these
covert programs the last thing they want
to do is be called red-handed in a wet
works operation wetworks or
assassinations a wet works operation
with the whole world watching
that&#39;s why i&#39;m still alive
and there&#39;s a conscious aikido to this
you know every ceo and high-tech person
and billionaire i&#39;ve met with wants to
do the technology monetize it have
patents keep it secret do the r d and
secrecy like you&#39;re developing another
piece of rubbish like this cell phone
this is junk chunk it&#39;s of no real
significance at all not going to change
the world you can it&#39;s a telephone that
you can talk on like in the
1900 early 1900s except it&#39;s wireless
using the same frequencies of a radio or
what have you it there&#39;s it&#39;s nothing
it&#39;s nothing
trillions of dollars into nothing
we&#39;re talking about doing something
that&#39;s going to change the operating
system of the whole planet in
consciousness and conscious intelligence
but also consciousness-based
technologies and technologies that are
over unity zero point plugged into
and now that you can&#39;t do with the
strategy that of being in the box
of venture capital you have to basically
create
a different consciousness around that
entire initiative so if there are any
high-tech people here or any high net
worth people here or you know of any
have them listen to this part of this
weekend
because we have to help gaia who is
being killed by us the earth
mother earth and you cannot do it with a
paradigm that&#39;s led to her destruction
so the paradigm of doing this as a
intellectual property and secret
the only way you&#39;re going to get that
out
is
uh if
you convince this other hardcore element
within the uh
intelligence community and and corporate
world
that they they should give up thousands
of trillions of dollars of asset base
utilities on coal and oil so that this
happens and they don&#39;t want to do that
and believe me there&#39;s no bill gates
can&#39;t take on this multi-trillion dollar
element bill gates has no money at all
compared to these guys
so
what can take them on
the masses of people knowing about it
the lab doing it is live streamed on the
internet it&#39;s done fully open source
in the instant you hit the sweet spot in
the resonant frequencies of a free
energy device the entire world knows it
and dozens of academic centers reproduce
it in real time you squeeze the
toothpaste out of the tube so hard and
so fast no one can put it back in and
the whole world knows about it at each
step
in fact if someone said here&#39;s a 100
million venture capital fund the first
thing this is the plan i&#39;m putting
together i&#39;ve been meeting with people
this week about this and todd i&#39;ve been
sending emails this morning about it so
there&#39;s a few billion dollar
funds reaching out to us is it they all
have the wrong strategy or most of them
because they&#39;re trying to recapitulate
the model that works for a cell phone
app
and i&#39;m going this isn&#39;t a cell phone
app
you know everyone thinks we built a
better mouse trap
and the the world would be at a path to
your door i said no murder incorporated
is going to beat a path to your door
and i have seen groups that have had 100
million dollars in an operating device
and they&#39;ve all vanished
every single one of them i&#39;ve watched
this for 25 years why
they&#39;ve done it secretively
they&#39;ve done it with intellectual
property or trade secrets the public
doesn&#39;t know they exist and when that
tree falls in the woods nobody knows it
we would do it in a way so that if some
goons came in to interfere with what we
were doing the whole world would know
and if they got in our way i&#39;d say
go and burn down the god damn
operations center here that did it
in other words you have to they&#39;re
terrified
of the public knowing about this and
getting behind it
and so if you&#39;re developing a technology
in secret or in confidence
or with non-disclosure agreements in
place
or with whatever
you&#39;re on the playing field of the
secrecy
that these devils are the master of
they&#39;re the masters of that
and so it&#39;s like the national
reconnaissance office that runs all the
super secret spy satellite they say we
own the night if you go to their
headquarters over their headquarters and
i tell people we need to own the light
the light of disclosure and doing this
openly transparently
for humanity
now the people say well then how would
the people get an investment back on
their funds well first of all if they&#39;re
worried about an investment back
and they&#39;re already a billionaire they
probably have a mental illness but
um
and and don&#39;t want to just do something
philanthropic for the world but let&#39;s
assume we want that i said let&#39;s let
let&#39;s have let&#39;s have
because i mean come on i mean how much
money do you need i mean geez you know i
mean after you have 100 million you
really can&#39;t spend it all before you&#39;re
dead
um
and we&#39;re talking about thousands of
billionaires today on the planet and
tens of thousands of centimillionaires
that have hundreds of millions and these
are the ones that are acknowledged
there are other people who are
unacknowledged that have more
so
look at it this way
does everyone know what the internet is
you know how it came about
no it was an al gore
he said i invented the internet
it&#39;s darpa the defense advanced research
projects administration and the
department of defense developed it
by the way
they still run it on own it it
it
penetrated it
um
but the internet
which is really very open source
everyone can get online
for free right
or you pay a subscription but the
internet itself
is free
and it&#39;s open source
well linux is open source
but the
f that foundation of a technology the
internet has then spawned
applications computers
apps
websites e-commerce that are worth
trillions of dollars
so what i&#39;m trying to have these folks
understand
and you can be my ambassadors to reach
out to them
is let&#39;s do this as
in place of darpa
because the government is not going to
do this because they&#39;re hopelessly
corrupt
and penetrated by corrupting influences
it&#39;s the biggest ricoh in the world
racketeering influence corrupt
organization
right the biggest mafia in the world so
the government is not going to do this
ever
therefore there is no equivalent of a
darpa to do this for us therefore let us
create our own
organization and entity that takes the
place of darpa to create this open
source
zero-point free energy
platform where it&#39;s shared openly
and then that same group
would then be able to take that
knowledge and do all the thousands of
vertical and horizontal applications
what do i mean by that
look at the globe
there are a billion motor vehicles on
the road every one of them need to have
a free energy electric motor in them
you can&#39;t count the trillions of dollars
that represents in manufacturing and
development
every single thing that takes energy
your heat pump
turns is turned in into is being run not
off the grid but it has one of these
systems built into it that heats and
cools your house
your home itself is running off
a zero point energy system well you got
100 200 million homes in america alone
but you take the whole world you&#39;re
talking about you know a billion homes
that need this
this is makes the marshall plan to
rebuild europe look like nothing
and so people who are worried about
like a golem with my oh my precious ring
my precious
precious bro
precious
no no no no no no that consciousness is
just ridiculous not only will that get
you killed it won&#39;t succeed and it&#39;s a
childish strategy and the reason is
childish is that if it&#39;s open source
and you&#39;re there there aren&#39;t enough
corporations extant
to
retool and build up the infrastructure
to replace the billion
motor vehicles
the billion homes
and then every other
you know vertical
not just geographical but vertical
application for example
this thing
you use it for a little while it&#39;s dead
what if it had a miniaturized zpe solid
state system in it
and there and and there was no battery
in it or a tiny little one just as sort
of a discharging
release of energy it never has to be
plugged in
your pc never has to be plugged in
your refrigerators manufactured ships
from the factory
with a
motor it has a motor in it now but the
zip is a zero point energy motor
all of those things
are
the when i&#39;m talking about these
different applications any one of which
is hundreds of billions to trillions of
dollars
in revenue
and those can then be patented
but the basic energy source and how it
works needs to be open source does this
make sense to folks
just like the internet is open source
and i&#39;m trying to convince
people who are high net worth ceos
individuals and also inventors to leave
behind this spook model of
of keeping an intellectual property have
it a trade secret we&#39;ll be so cute we&#39;re
going to out fox
the secret government we&#39;re going to
take the patent for it and divide it
into 100 patents and they won&#39;t know
what we&#39;re doing
by the time you&#39;ve had that thought and
it&#39;s emanated from your cortex
classified projects know that&#39;s what
you&#39;re going to do and i&#39;m not kidding
because they have technologies that that
are at that level
of spyware
therefore leave that whole paradigm
behind
do it massively do it open do it now do
it yesterday
and then we&#39;ll regain in a few years the
lost century
and we&#39;ll have a new civilization on
earth
beautiful that&#39;s what i recommend
now
getting back to consciousness i know i
went on a sidebar but i just wanted to
say this because
i can get off my chest
therapy you&#39;re my therapist also
there&#39;s a lot of stress doing this by
the way yeah it&#39;s the only person who
knows is my wife
uh really
but we&#39;re we&#39;re in a position right now
where if we have
the plan to do that we need the
consciousness
of all you folks
doing it with us not only watching
networking but also in this meditative
state giving protection and guidance
and it works it&#39;s like the power of
non-locality of mind for prayer or
intercessionary all that really does
work they&#39;ve done studies and you know
larry dossey and who i know i mean have
documented how that works
and so we need everyone to do this at
every level whether it&#39;s conscious
technological financial what have you
and that&#39;s what it&#39;s going to take to
move the earth off of its path that is
headed towards extinction
onto a path that goes forward for half a
million years of advanced civilization
that becomes interstellar
and this is the choice i call this the
choice
and if we sit together and look at the
world around us it&#39;s really obvious that
this is the choice but
we need to have people who articulate it
so all of you need to be ambassadors to
the public articulating this this is why
i&#39;m trying to give you the lexicon and
the concepts so you can go out there and
explain this
or share this video with folks
and the remote viewing capability is
also important to guiding this path most
of what i&#39;ve achieved personally in my
life was seen in a lucid dream or a
meditative state before i ever spoke of
it or did it all of it
starting when i was 18.
and in fact when i started the center
for the study of extraterrestrial
intelligence
i was in a deep meditative state at
night
i was actually in the the the
this big house we had um
in the upstairs master bedroom den with
a fireplace and i was on the futon
because we had little babies who were up
and i had to work a 24-hour non-stop
shift in the er
but
so i was in that room and i was i went
in i was going to sleep and i was
meditating and suddenly i went into the
state of consciousness and in the right
hand corner of the room to the right of
the fireplace
was this beautiful
golden white spherical object
and it was interstellar but also cosmic
conscious god consciousness level of i
mean these are the primogenitors of life
on earth
from whence we have come
and i connected to this
conscious
communication sphere
and
just
mind-melded with it set up and wrote
down everything that&#39;s happened from now
till then everything we&#39;ve done
that&#39;s how it happened that was in 1990
august of 1990. so
that&#39;s what each of us can do
in our lives and
it it&#39;s something that gives so much
power to what you&#39;re doing and so much
safety but also effectiveness
and efficiency
so if you&#39;re wanting to be on a ce
hello
if you&#39;re wanting to be on a ce5 contact
team this is what you really want to do
you want to be able to be in this state
of consciousness
go back to what we were talking about
about 45 minutes ago this
flow consciousness of joy
and
remote view distant
places or the ground around you or
underneath the ground
because they can be
underneath the ground yeah
and connect to those
beings
and invite them into
a meeting
and then see how it happens how it
unfolds
it may be 3d it may be fourth d it may
be 10th d
it may be electronic it may be visual it
may be an orb it may be a full
spacecraft it may be an extraterrestrial
biological being that materializes right
there outside your circle or inside your
circle
everything i&#39;ve just said has happened
on these expeditions
but
it doesn&#39;t really matter how they appear
the key is understand
why
what is it what does it take on the part
of the team
so the team needs to be able to have
this understanding of consciousness as
operative and become you become
proficient in meditation and then
proficient in the ability to have your
eyes open and at the same time remote
viewing and also be coherent as a team
that last thing is a very difficult one
because of the human ego structure
i tell people you don&#39;t need the cast of
thousands out with you
you can do it by yourself but i actually
recommend that it be with you know
anywhere from three to eight people you
get bigger groups than that the ability
to get coherence and where everyone&#39;s on
the same page decreases exponentially
it&#39;s just the nature of it has
unless they&#39;re incredibly evolved large
group it&#39;s very hard to find
so i recommend a smaller group that go
out and do this and work on this
together as opposed to the great big
group
and when you get into that coherence
together and deep consciousness together
it is an exponential increase in
the attraction
that the interstellar civilizations will
have to you because they&#39;re looking for
not just individuals today to contact
they want groups of people because
that&#39;s setting up the morphogenic field
for all of society to have contact you
understand we&#39;re the pioneers we&#39;re the
tip of the arrow
and we&#39;re creating that wave form by
doing this as a group that&#39;s why i
started the ce5 initiative in 1990
and as we do that as in as in a group
format
it begins to model in deep consciousness
subconscious levels
and affects
all of human society to be able to
accept
contact openly without fear
and without it running into the star
wars scenario
so the power of the ce5 effort is based
in this group coherence
this is making sense the folks
and that&#39;s what i want you to understand
and you know sometimes small is
beautiful
a smaller group of people is is really
very effective so wherever you live you
know you can get on our website
siriusdisclosure.com and you&#39;ll see that
there&#39;s a free app that you can download
to see where there are other people in
your area now memo there those of you
joining it who don&#39;t put an email
address in or a text number or something
there&#39;s no way for someone to get hold
of you so go back in there and put in
even just get a hotmail account or open
another account just for that so that
people can network together that&#39;s the
whole point of the app
but if you look at that there are now
people on every continent and all over
the world thousands
but and so you can find people wherever
you live to do this i don&#39;t care if
you&#39;re in india or
africa or argentina
it&#39;s amazing when we launched it a
couple years ago i just saw the whole
world light up with the sea city
triangle logos on elk continents
beautiful it&#39;s beautiful so that kind of
mass consciousness is
what&#39;s happening now imagine if that&#39;s
happening
when we do this and we we&#39;re going to
try to incorporate this entanglement
app
that adam curry is working on into our
new
training app the cse training app which
is a separate app there&#39;s a small fee to
get downloaded
most of it goes to the itunes stores and
the app developer very little to us
but it will have
in it these tools
like a built-in random number generator
training system for you developing this
non-locality of consciousness
and
ability to affect
as a consciousness assisted technology
and we&#39;re very excited i mean the
conversations i&#39;ve had with adam curry
are that there&#39;s enormous uh
synchronicity in him rolling that system
out now when we&#39;re wanting to start a
second version of our contact app
in the meanwhile
there are things that you can do
meditation wise and practice wise to
sharpen your remote viewing ability
and that&#39;s what i want to go through uh
uh some of these
sort of exercises
all right and and and they&#39;re they&#39;re
all really very beautiful and simple and
they&#39;re they&#39;re
really based on they&#39;re they&#39;re limited
by your imagination and how many of
these you can set up
and in fact let me just say something
every opportunity
everything that happens every event
stimulus that happens in your life every
day is an opportunity to use
non-locality of consciousness
to sharpen your skills
what i mean by that the phone rings
instead of looking at the caller id take
a second between the second ring and the
third
to sense and feel who&#39;s calling
seriously there&#39;s a knock on the door
before you open it to look
sense feel with your heart your mind
your senses your conscious field that is
omnipresent who is it
you see what i&#39;m saying
you&#39;re driving down the highway
someplace you&#39;ve never been
what does the around that curve and over
that mountain what am i going to see
when i get there
now i call this on the fly remote
viewing real time remote viewing where
you lit begin to live and practice that
mindfulness it&#39;s really fun it&#39;s playful
it&#39;s fun and the more you do it
you&#39;ll find that the time frame of of
your accuracy begins to to
you you collapse time frames and your
accuracy goes up exponentially
mainly people don&#39;t do it because
they&#39;re too
lazy to change their habitual way of
doing things
yogananda once said
mainly the reason people don&#39;t develop
spiritually spiritually is spiritual
lassitude laziness and a lack of
spiritual adventuresomeness
so be adventuresome and be playful
and you will find that once you
understand what consciousness is there&#39;s
almost an infinite number of
opportunities
in any given day
to practice this ability now there are
spectacular peak experiences like seeing
a brain tumor in someone and saving
their life i&#39;m glad i was able to save
that man&#39;s life
but there are other things that maybe
seem trivial but they help you develop
and sharpen that ability and here&#39;s the
beauty of that when you begin to give
yourself to it freely and let it be flow
consciousness coming through you in a
playful childlike way
when you get a correct
remote view and intuition
and it gets fed back to you
that&#39;s positive feedback loop and the
more that happens the more you go i can
do this this is real oh my god you see
what i mean and then that heightens your
confidence and the more confident and
relaxed you are that you can do it the
more you&#39;ll be able to do it more and
more so it begins to snowball
and that&#39;s what i found when i was a
teenager when i started practicing these
things
these techniques and and having these
experiences
when i would have something that would
happen it&#39;d be very accurate i&#39;d go
wow that does work and then it happened
again and i then became going well
then i had no question i could do it and
once all doubt leaves your mind
and you actually believe in the truest
sense of the word it&#39;s not just believe
you know
it&#39;s a knowingness that this is possible
and you affirm it
then there&#39;s no stopping what you can do
don&#39;t look to me
and people or ingo swan or guru this or
maharishi that or dalai lama here or
whatever to do this for you
i always tell people don&#39;t do this
spiritual codependency trip
the last thing i ever want to be is a
guru
or whatever whereas people are going and
you know do this for me i said well go
do it for yourself you lazy sack
no i mean i do actually even when i&#39;m
leading things i&#39;m actually going into
each individual and augmenting it and
that&#39;s what a teacher does
but
so last night i&#39;m sure a lot of you may
have felt that
but i&#39;ve done this for decades
you know actually
but you really want to own this yourself
because you don&#39;t want to have other
another person be a crutch for you
the other thing is don&#39;t think that just
because you&#39;re not ingo swan anybody
know who ingo swan was the guy a very
fantastic remote viewer but got taken in
by sri and the military and i used to
spend time with him at his home before
he passed away and
brilliant man
very intuitive incredibly accurate
but he regretted i have a beautiful
letter from him where he&#39;s talking about
what we&#39;re doing with the c seti
center for the study of extraterrestrial
intelligence uh close encounters of the
fifth kind initiative was the ultimate
application taking seriously
the not only the et presence but
utilizing in a way that&#39;s incredibly
practical
and
the highest application
of
this science of consciousness
uh to the world situation into the
cosmic moment we&#39;re in he loved it um
and one of my problems is when people
look at the folks like that they sort of
then
idolize them as somebody that&#39;s a
it&#39;s it&#39;s like trying an inventor trying
to find
an element that doesn&#39;t exist i call it
unobtainium so this is not
this is not attainable this is
unobtainium
and they get into that mindset and this
is the danger of people who are
put forward as adepts because it steals
the power from people
of thinking that they can do everything
that they&#39;re doing so look at it this
way anything i&#39;ve done anything a
vedic master has done anything that
the dalai lama can do anything that
ringo swan did
every single one of you can do
every single one of you and don&#39;t give
me any excuses
no excuses
so
feel that you are capable of doing this
have a very positive playful approach to
it and you can do it
now here i&#39;m going to share in a moment
a few of these sort of techniques
and
when you&#39;re first starting out it&#39;s you
know most people
uh
need some things to just sharpen their
ability and i want to go through
a
over the next half hour or so
and then we&#39;ll take a break
uh uh the sort of the atmospherics of
this first
and then a few little techniques
you
