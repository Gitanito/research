Experience Description:   

After I fell, I felt a tightening in my chest as I attempted to get up. After that I felt like I was skiing again and it was very peaceful and serene. Suddenly it felt like I fell again and I was out of control when my eyes opened I saw my feet kicking as if I was trying to stop myself until I realized I was not moving at all. When I stood up, I was not sure what had happened at first - meaning I was disoriented and there was nobody near me, except the people passing above me on the ski lift. Once I realized that knew I had fell and I was out. My body shook and I returned to skiing to catch up with my partner who stated that we were apart for four to five minutes.
