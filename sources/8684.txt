  		I am currently married   		to my karmic soul-mate and together we have many children from a blended   		marriages. We have experienced the karmic relationship that has been   		many challenges, highs and lows, learning and growing from each other.   		Love is present.

  		At my new job, my first   		day&nbsp;was the day that I met my twin soul. No accident. My life has never   		been the same. I walked over to where some employees were standing. I   		said hello, and then turned to my&nbsp;left and I laid eyes on him. My world   		stopped. I seemed to have lost my hearing. I was amazed. I didn't turn   		away. I was shameless. I was in total awe. I did not blink. I could not   		stop taking in every centimeter, every inch of him. My love. My baby.   		There he was.

  		We erupted in odd   		conversation about our highest passion immediately... the other   		employees just looked at us and walked away, not sure what to think. The   		job didn't matter, who was there didn't matter, what day of the week   		didn't matter, what I was wearing didn't matter. I felt totally seen by   		him.&nbsp;I felt naked in the sense that he saw me, and I relished in it. He   		was looking at me the same way. He was chuckling, laughing...like he   		knew! That made me so nervous. I felt like I was high. I was not acting   		as I normally do. I was almost having an out of body experience because   		I was observing myself, truly amazed in my behavior. I wanted to take   		his hand and walk out of there and start our life, our passion, and   		start doing what&nbsp;our purpose is on this planet. What we are here for. we   		finally found each other.

  		&nbsp;I knew this within 2 to   		3 minutes of conversing with him. Then I got scared. I totally snapped   		out of it after 20 minutes of talking excitedly with him. I tried, and   		still to this day, try to manage my behavior around him. I try not to   		interfere with his life. He was married too, at the time. It has been   		months now, since this experience. Quickly, I will give an account of   		the 'strangeness' of this union. We have so much to say to each other,   		we&nbsp;were 'updating' each other in the beginning...then it became about   		our future.

  		We&nbsp;were both unhappy and   		unfulfilled in our marriage, even though we love our spouses. Our signs   		had coincidences, birthdays, places we traveled, our choice of partners   		based&nbsp;physical appearance, and races, our likes, opinions, goals...are   		the same. Too many to mention.&nbsp;Our first kiss (which was inevitable)   		felt as though&nbsp;I was kissing myself.&nbsp;I couldn't believe it. When we look   		at each other there is a liquidity in our eyes, I seem to enter him, and   		come back out. Like a flow of our energy. I get 'sucked' in without any   		choice.

  		&nbsp;We totally know each   		other. We finally found each other. We know someday we will be together.   		We already know this. We have spoken about 'what are we going to do   		now'? Because it was too obvious we found each other. Our conversations   		were like we were 'picking up' where we left off.

  		His marriage has ended.   		Quite suddenly. Being there for him, and also giving him space has been   		a dance. I feel his pain when&nbsp;I am not around him. When he laughs it is   		music to my ears. His voice is like the heavens open up and angels are   		singing, when he speaks.&nbsp;I have an unbelievable listening of him.&nbsp;   		Strange protectiveness, yet totally certainty of his individuality from   		me. There is no jealousy, no anger. He is more important than any human   		being alive to&nbsp;me. But I know I am apart of him. So this 'oneness'   		creates a completeness that I know no one else could fill.&nbsp; We have   		decided to wait to consummate our union. When there is no one that would   		be hurt.

  		The only pain I feel is   		not being with him, talking, or seeing him. Physical heart pain. My love   		was instant and complete from the beginning. He looks at me with me so   		much love in his eyes it is overwhelming and unbearable.&nbsp;I see future,   		earth, eternity, life, death, birth, heaven in his eyes. I see God. I   		have never felt so in tune with myself, or another human, or my purpose   		like&nbsp;I do now.

  		He looks at me with the   		same awe and amazement. I see how I affect him. This letter has been so   		general considering how much more there is I could say about this, but I   		would have 12 pages! I have no idea if we will be together soon, or we   		have to wait for a time. So many things are happening so fast. I feel   		totally torn. I have a good husband. But, I know he is not my twin.   		Being without my twin is impossible. I was so afraid to lose him in the   		beginning I would cry and cry. I have not told him, but we have allluded   		to it. We&nbsp;say there is 'magic'. I thank God everyday for bringing him   		back to me. Now I know perfect love. I cannot wait to see what the   		future holds for us.        </body>
