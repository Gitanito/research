  		              		Experience Description   

    In 1976 I was in a near fatal car accident. I was young and somewhat foolish. I was living in Colorado at the time and visiting my parents in New York.  I had travelled with my roommate, who was also from the area. A young lady, who I was interested in,  invited us to a party. At the party I had some alcoholic drinks. Although I wasn't drunk, I decided to act more intoxicated than I was.  That way I could say that I needed a ride home and could leave my mother’s car at the young lady's house.  Then I would have an excuse to come back the next day. I had a few more drinks and then my roommate and I drove back to my parent's house. When I was almost there I remembered that my sister needed the car in the morning to go to work. I asked my friend to drive me back to the party.  He didn't really want to go back, but I reassured him that I was fine to drive and told him about my plan so I could see the young lady the next day when I picked up the car. He understood my reasoning and drove me back. 

  Needless to say, I did not make it back to my parent's home because I fell asleep at the wheel and and drove into a very large tree. Later on looking at the pictures of the car and couldn't believe I survived. There was only a small chunk in the tree where the car hit it. 

  I remember seeing my body leaning against the tree and a police officer was crouching down, looking at me. I was floating above the accident scene. I was also surrounded by white light, where I saw my body despite it being night time.  I did not feel like I was going into the Light as much as I was already in the White Light.  I had a feeling that everything was okay even if it was beyond what I could understand. I did feel a gentle breeze moving me upwards. I had the feeling that everything was alright. I felt really good, benevolent, full of love and compassion. All of a sudden, I heard a voice say, 'You have to go back, your Father wants you to stay.' I felt that the voice was an all-knowing authority and that it was all right that I was going back into my body. After the car accident, I was unconscious for three days.    

  When I woke up, my journey began.   During my NDE, I went into my Soul Level. During the time that I was out of my body, I was my true spiritual self. Since my conscious mind was not limiting what I could know and understand, I was able to know and understand everything all at once. The feeling I had that everything is all right is the truth.  In some of the traditions that I have since studied, they talk about the divine ocean of love and compassion. My experience was more like a white sky of love and compassion. 

  Saying that I had a feeling that everything is all right might be understating it. It is a knowing that myself, everything, and everyone is REALLY all right and good. When I am in touch with this feeling, I see a lot of all right and good in others and in everything. As I am writing this it sounds small compared to what it is. But it is gentle and caring in a way that does not impose itself on others or anything. In one way this feeling is subtle but cannot be denied. It is a general direction with a knowing that the most wonderful, most loving, and the most compassionate experience is felt by moving in that direction. That feeling is ahead and here in the moving toward it. 

    I had an experience that I did not really pay very much attention to at the time. I didn't understand the impact it would have on my life until years later. I mentioned my experience to one of the professors after a workshop I taught there. She asked me to speak to her class that she taught on Death and Dying. I was happy to do that. I like teaching and thought I could teach about spirituality, one of my favorite subjects. 

  I started to do research to be prepared. I also posted a notice online that I was going to be talking about the near death experience and got a big turn-out. 

  During my research, I could see that the near death experience was a turning point in my life.

  After the car accident, I started to meet a lot of people that had near death experiences and like me, it was because of their experience that they had become interested in Spiritual studies. Some, like myself, had developed astute intuition and sensitivity to the energy of others, a connection to a feeling of benevolence that is present everywhere, and experienced this energy in their hands when touching others. At that time, I did not acknowledge how amazing this is. My desire to learn more about this benevolence was stronger than my understanding that it was unique and wonderful. I wanted more. 

    Looking back and after years of studying Spiritual phenomenon, I know during the NDE that my spiritual seeing and healing abilities were activated.  Since then, my life’s journey had become about connecting to this great source and serving others.   When I work with someone, I can see this light in them that is all right and good. I also can see how to connect them to that light both energetically and psychologically.  I have a natural ability to know what to talk to them about to open up their consciousness and conscious mind to allow them to connect with this source of benevolence and well-being and it heals many things.

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         No     

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Jewish.   I was born into a Jewish family. Had some education.  
  
  Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I started a journey that has evolved over the years.  
  
  What is your religion now?         Christian- Other Christian.   After my NDE, I felt a strong connection with Mary and Jesus. I have since studied many religions. I spend years studying Sufism and still feel a strong connection to those beliefs and that tradition. I do Tai chi, yoga and meditate  
  
  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I had always had a connection to mystical experiences, mostly when watching or reading science fiction or in my religious education while growing up. I was always taught that these things are not true and are stories. I still felt chills inside when hearing them. I have seen some amazing things and facilitated healing that is amazing. When I am doing it, it seems all normal when I think about it afterwards.  
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I was all about the practical life before and now I am all about the spiritual  life.
  
  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   I heard a voice say to me, 'You have to go back, your father wants you to stay.' I knew this was from a very caring, loving voice of great wisdom and knew that the father they referred to was God. I also felt a very strong presence of Jesus looking over the whole process.  
  
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I sensed their presence  

  Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         Yes   I experienced Jesus. I felt a very strong presence of Jesus. At the time, I did not know exactly what it was. Not too long after the experience, a Sufi Sheikh talked to me about Mary and how she was so open to  Jesus and the Christ. Then, I knew that is what happened.  
  
During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I was in a place that felt like there were many consciousnesses;  some were more individual and some were all-encompassing.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I felt three distinct beings and more of a place. One was the presence of God, the second was Jesus and the third was the teacher or guide (but much bigger) who was telling me to go back.  
  
Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

  During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I had, and still have, a very strong knowing that I do understand and that I can help people understand. Sometimes I work with people and their physical ailments are healed in a moment. It is really cool. There is a part of acceptance and loving that is wonderful.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     I knew the purpose of life and that I had a mission to help others to know this. It is hard to put into words but I still have that. Actually, putting into words takes away from it because it is so big. I know that if I do my best and speak from a place that is connected to that incredible love, then people get it. It has happened many times. I think trying to put what I do  into words, limits the experience because it is so big and can be so many things.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.     Yes.     I knew that I exist outside of time and the physical level and that there are many levels.
  
  Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     I had an understanding that I can heal people through touch. I have spent my life since the experience learning how to use this and understand mentally the whole thing.  
  
During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     Again, hard to put into words. But love is what everyone is looking for and is the purpose of everything. Love heals anything and everything.  
  
  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     I have spent my life since learning and practicing spirituality.  
  
  Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I had some close friends who were freaked out by the change in me. When I started being open about it, those friendships ended. I don't think so much about the story of the experience but by the actually change in myself since that time. As I have learned to accept my gift, it has become stronger. I think the feeling people get with me is that I can see things, and even more so, because what I see is a great positive thing.  
  
After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I remember it. When people ask if the experience was true,  an illusion,  my imagination, or some psychological phenomenon, I say I remember what I remember. I know it to be true even if there is no way to prove it. I know what has in my life since my experience.  
  
  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     My main gift is that I can help people either connect to this wonderful thing we are talking about or heal physically, mentally or emotionally. What I can see, know or feel varies from person to person. Sometimes I see what has happened in the past, sometimes in the future, past lives, blocks or imbalances in the body,mind or emotions, energy bodies, family line, etc.  
  
Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The feeling of Love that I can connect to. That I am loved spiritually more than I can know in my mind.  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Not too long after my experience, I meet a Sufi Sheikh. He would talk about death and how it was like the spiritual journey. I studied about it then. I also meet a lot of people who had near death experiences but did not talk about mine very much. I didn't even think about it much for years. I started sharing about mine a couple of years ago. People are open to it. Some of the people that are/where close to me had a hard time with it. About two years ago when I was teaching a class,   the woman who invited me mentioned that she was teaching a class on the process of life and dying. I mentioned that I had a near death experience and she invited me to give a talk about it. I posted something online about teaching the class and got a lot of interest so I started sharing my story more.  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I didn't think about it much except that I had this knowing, desire to know more and an ability to help others. 
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I know what I know and what I can do. It has taken a while to feel comfortable with it.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   Meditation, when I work with someone and I have meet others who can also.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         No  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I think you did good.
