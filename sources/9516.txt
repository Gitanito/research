I could not bear the burning pain

and wanted to die.

Delmar, my husband, held me in his arms.

I begged him to let me die.

I knew that he could not bear

seeing me in that much pain.

He held me closer and closer.



No more pain.

Death is merciful.



Zoë was leaving her body,

soaring through pitch black space

of profound peace.

Reaching her own origins,

at the beginning of time,

No words can describe those

Feelings of belonging,

She was part of all there is



She was home.



There was no tunnel of light,

no angels to greet her.

Protected and content

She was granted a glance

into life after death



For a split second?

For minutes? She doesn't know.



She was whole.



She had to return to her body

To finish a task. 

of forgiveness, 

to heal and to love ,



Knowing that soon she has

to leave the body again, 

for a new beginning.



Comfort



Like an atom, neutron, or proton,

soul is the smallest particle there is

and the most powerful of all.

Soul is eternal.

Zoe is life, and a name for soul.
