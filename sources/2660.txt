FOREWORD
"Thought, which is free, cannot be bounded
by any limits. The true motion which lies
at the foundation of everything, is the mo
tion of thought. All that arrests the motion
of thought ... ij false."1
The first edition of this publication
which appeared in 1927 under the
title: "Normal and Supernormal
Telepathy," met with such a gratify
ing reception and aroused so much
genuine interest that I am encouraged
not only to revise but to add consider
ably to the subject matter of the book,
especially in the interpretation of the
symbology of the figures. In this
chapter I have made somewhat free
use of the works of such distinguished
1
Tertium Organum by P. Ouspensky.

Bragdon, Mr. Edward Churchward,
Mr. Will Durant, Mr. P. Ouspensky,
Gerald Massey, and Rudolph Steiner,
to whom I wish to express my grati
tude. The data thus obtained has en
abled me to give a much more compre
hensive view of Geometrical Telep
athy than would otherwise have been
possible.
I present this revised edition of
"Normal and Supernormal Telep
athy" primarily to revive the subject,
but especially to invite investigation
and co-operation. If this can be ac
complished my time will indeed have
been well spent.
The Author.

GEOMETRIC TELEPATHY
"l only intend to impart one single Idea and yet I
can find no shorter way of expressing it, than this
whole book."
WELVE years have elapsed
li since my first tentative effort
i 1 to invent a system to demon
strate that mind could actually reach
out to mind independently of any
known channels of sense by using
geometric figures as vehicles of
thought transmission.
I began by some experiments.
First I selected a few figures such
as the Circle, Triangle, Square, Poly
gon, and the Cross in its display of the
Schopenhauer.

Open Cube. Then I invented a code
based on what I knew of the symbol
ism of the figures with an original
system of transmission; and on Sep
tember the 7th, 1926 I sent a telepath
to a lady residing fifty miles away
from my home, having previously
notified her to be ready to receive the
message at a certain day and hour. It
reached her in five minutes in two dif
ferent planes, and finally it arrived
in the Plane-form of the construction
figure itself.
Thus, the impression of the parts
was first presented to her mind, while
that of the figure followed.
She did not see it by any form of
clairvoyance or by actual normal vi
sion. Not at all. I should have been
greatly disappointed had she done so.

What happened was that she suddenly
knew the significance of the commu

Unmistakably she knew
it.
When she wrote me of the experi

I
realized she was an excellent
subject — having learned the art of
concentrating without tension — and

I
arranged for further experiments.
During the first week six mes
sages out of ten registered correctly,
and the code enabled her to decipher
the telepaths, the experiment having
been accomplishehd without the use
of

plained the system to her and she
willingly consented to collaborate
with me. This lady happened to be
of an extremely receptive nature, and
being a musician of great ability she,
also, had learned the art of concen
trating. All of which was in her fa
vor, and very fortunate for me.
I told her she was to begin by ban
ishing all thought from her mind and
completely relaxing without the slight
est tension. She was able to do so
with no difficulty. I mention the fact
because few people are able to do this
without considerable training, and
even then they do not always succeed.
But my friend happened to be very
expert both in concentration and re
laxation.

of going into another room and clos
ing all doors between us to send her
a telepath, she looked incredulous.
And no wonder.
However, I did so.
When I returned she seemed even
more incredulous.
"Well, what did you get," I in
quired, "anything?"
"It seems impossible," she replied,
"but I distinctly feel as if you sent
me a Square."
"Correct. I did send you a Square."
She was amazed.
Then, still dubious, she continued:
"Yes, but do you suppose I could
send you a message in the same way."
"Let us try. But of course you must
select a different figure"

After a little more explanation and
rehearsing, I again left the room, and
five minutes later I received a Tri
angle.
"You sent me a Triangle," I an
nounced upon returning.
I never saw anyone more surprised.
"Why I did — I did send you a
Triangle," she almost gasped, so great
was her astonishment.
We discussed the subject pro and
con for half an hour or so, both feel
ing excited and triumphant.
"Then this is true!" She could
scarcely realize it even after she had
put it to the test.
"Yes, it is true. And some day the
whole world will admit it."

she prepared to take her departure, "I
was wondering —when I reach home
if you would be able to telepath me
in the same way."
"I am sure I could. At least we
might try. I am quite willing if you
are."
"It would be some little distance,
you see."
"Distance makes no difference
whatsoever," I explained. "For when
mind contacts mind, space is annihi
lated. Is it not a convention after all?

not matter whether you are in the

away."
"I should like to try it," she decided.
"It is so incredible, so utterly amaz
ing and impossible, and yet . .
"
"Yet you have just put it to the test
with perfect success."
"Even so, I am unable to under
stand how it can possibly be done."
"Probably no one will ever under

Let us be satisfied with the verifiable
fact that it does and can."
Clearly she was impressed.

done so.
After ten minutes the phone again
sounded.
An excited voice rang out: "I
know you sent me a Circle," it said,
"not one, but half a dozen. I felt as
though the room was full of them —
Circles, Circles, Circles! Did you
send me a Circle?"
"I sent you a Circle," I replied.
But when — later on — some of my
well-meaning, incredulous friends
said : "Perhaps it is true, though what
possible use is it?" I probably felt very
much like Benjamin Franklin, who,
when demonstrating his lightning rod,
answered this same stupid question
with the historic reply: "What's the
use of a newborn baby?"

Telepathy! A mere toy.
That was, and has been, the con
sensus of opinion.
A parlor game!
Yes, perhaps, in its present stage of
development.
But they said the same of Marconi's
wireless apparatus when it was first
exhibited :
"All very well and good, very inter
esting, very intriguing. A delightful
toy. But what is the use of it?"
Well, time has shown the use both
of the lightning rod and of the wire
less. I do not think anyone can chal
lenge the truth of that statement.
In this elementary textbook it is not
my intention to go into the history of
Telepathy. Frankly, so far as I know,

it has no very extensive history — as
yet.
In his introduction of a book on
Telepathy and Clairvoyance by Ru
dolph Tischner, Mr. E. J. Dingwall
says : "Telepathy was unknown as a
demonstrable fact before 1882, when
the classic series of experiments with
the Misses Creery were conducted by
Sir William Barrett, Professor Henry
Sidgwick, Mr. W. F. H. Myers, and
Mr. Edmund Gurney. Since those
days the Psychological Research So
ciety has published a great number of
cases, both those in which the faculty
appeared spontaneously and also
those where experimental methods
were employed."

as containing valuable data on mental
phenomena of various kinds.
But between 1885 and the present
time Telepathy really does not seem
to have been brought very conspicu
ously to the fore, although I am in
formed that recently some very able
investigators have delved into Telepa
thy with considerable success.
It is for this reason perhaps more
than any other, that I have decided to
revise my former textbook entitled:
"Normal and Supernormal Telepa
thy" published in 1927, as I hope now
to be able to furnish much more in
formation on the subject, and to offer
suggestions that will positively enable
the serious student to demonstrate the
fact that normal Telepathy actually

exists here and now, and with study
and patience can be proved.
Questions are repeatedly asked me
somewhat as follows :
"If there is really anything in it
why has it not been investigated by
the scientific world? Why has it not
made more progress since 1885?"
Questions such as these and many
others.
Well to me the answer is obvious,
and it is my chief reason for revising
my original book.
Telepathy has advanced so slowly,
because very few investigators seem
to have realized that you can only
transmit Concepts, not actual words,
telepathically, and that it is only the
Image arising from the Concept

You may concentrate on an object
such as a chair, house, table, or book
for the rest of your life without being
able to telepath it—normally. Of
course if the subject is hypnotized,
he will be able to read your mind, for
then both of you will have entered into
that mysterious realm called the Sub
conscious, about which we know so
little and hope so much.
This is mind-reading. But I am
talking of something quite different :
What I claim
is,
that two normal
individuals cannot telepath words

organs. What they can do, however,

course we cannot see them. How
ever, no one can deny their reality.
In Telepathy it is just these abstrac

the image we can transmit. Natur
ally each special Concept must be
mathematically adapted to the appro

nificance, symbolically representing
to the consciousness that which is not
perceived.
Just as a color contains within its
prismatic rays many, many varieties
of hue, so the Concept of a word—a

of the Concept itself.
Thus both thought and feeling may
combine in the imagery of the Con
ceptual telepath.
And here we have the reason we
cannot telepath actual words.
The Image they form in the mind is
too concrete.
At first glance dealing with such
abstractions seems complicated. But
it is not really so. On the contrary it
is all quite simple and logical once the

told) in 1927, with the hope of being
able to obtain some sort of status for
Telepathy, as I well knew that until
a little further knowledge of its laws
and the conditions governing them
was established, no more progress in
the future could be made than had—
apparently —been in the past.
I confidently believe, however, that
this book does contain at least the nu
cleus of an elementary system of
Telepathy, and while it approaches
the confines of the mysterious realm
of the Subconscious, its approach is
normal, in full waking conscious
ness, and solely through the quasi-
mathematical process of geometry,
lifting it I hope out of the realm of
superstition for all time.

As we all know, radio signals are
propagated by waves in the ether,
originated by setting up high-fre
quency oscillations, radiated from an
aerial.
Telepathic signals are also propa
gated by waves in the ether, originated
by setting up high-frequency oscilla
tions, but in the present geometric
system, radiated through the medium
of human vibration.
These vibrations being common to
all mankind, are destined in the fu
ture to be utilized in various and di
vergent ways, totally unsuspected in
this day and generation. At present,
however, and for our purpose they
are to be considered solely in their re
lation to Telepathy.

THE THOUGHT WAVE 21
To send a telepath, it is first neces
sary to concentrate for a few moments
upon some outstanding quality of the
person for whom it is intended; next
to fix the mind on the nature of the
message to be conveyed, and finally,
to encase the thought in an appropri
ate geometrical figure, imaging it
well in front of closed eyes, and then
with all the mental energy possible
sending it forth in this special figure,
through the ether, which will serve as
its vehicle of transmission.
Now to do this is not so easy as it
sounds, because it will be found that
it is riot a simple matter to keep any
of the figures —especially the Trian
gles—motionless. These seem to hold
within their three lines the sum total
of all the movement in the universe,

The investigator will soon experi
ence a novel sensation because he will
realize two strange factors in relation
to the experiment: the first is that the
figure itself, if not actually a living
thing certainly may be classed as a liv
ing element. The second factor will
be the discovery that it is unmistaka
bly impatient to be off and away on its
telepathic errand, hence its inherent
restlessness.
I defy anyone to keep an Isosceles-
Triangle motionless for five minutes

ject to the will. Over and over again
it will swerve from side to side. In

A liquid has the added power of lat

Of course there may be other books

Gerald Massey, but those ponderous

SYMBOLOGY OF THE FIGURES 45
I shall begin by describing the sym-
bology of the Triangle, as it is said to
be the basis of practically all the other
figures. Hence it is very important in
Telepathy, especially as—apart from
the Isosceles-Triangle — it is perhaps
one of the very easiest figures to tele-
path.
This figure may be described as be
ing the very epitome of activity, rest
lessness and movement — even the
movement of the waters of the ocean
and the ripple of the waves. Indeed
all the Triangles partake of a super
abundance of movement. They may
be summed up in their relation to
mundane affairs as eager, kindly, very
anxious to be helpful, quick, construc
tive, and invariably the messengers of
good cheer and hope.

It is indeed heartening to receive a
Triangle.
If I speak of them as actual living
Entities, it is because I believe they
are. Otherwise how account for the
instinctive intelligence they display?
But when I say living Entities I refer
to their activities manifested cosmic-
ally as living elements.
When you receive a Triangle tele-
pathically it will invariably mean that
things are moving towards a success
ful issue. But it signifies a great deal
more than movement.

THE EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE
Let us now consider the Equilateral
Triangle, not only from my own view
point but from that of the distin
guished writer Edward Churchward,
who says : "The Equilateral Triangle
symbolizes the Creator, and as the
Creator dwells in heaven, it must nec
essarily symbolize heaven also, for,
where the Lord
is,
there
is
heaven.
Wherever or whenever the Equilat
eral Triangle
is
met with in ancient
writings or inscriptions,
it
is
either in
reference to the Triune Godhead, or
heaven, or both." Indeed "the com
pounding of the symbols—the Tri

which entwined religion with sci
ence."1
Apart from the above symbolism,
the Equilateral Triangle has, of
course, in common with all the fig
ures, certain distinctive attributes in
relation to mundane affairs, depend
ing on where, when, and in what man
ner used. Therefore the Triangles in
general may be synthesized as indicat
ing union and activity of various
kinds and degrees : union of Spirit, of
faith, ideas, purposes, love, friend
ship, marriage, life, death, in fact
union in activity in every sense of the
word. All of which must be taken
into account in the formation of tele
pathic codes.

52 GEOMETRIC TELEPATHY
The symbology upon which tele
pathic codes must be based is really of
vital importance and cannot be ques
tioned or overlooked either now or in
the future. And remember the image
of the figure (which is what we tele-
path) being a concept is "depicted by
imaginary mathematical lines and can
have no sides at all, being merely a
phantom of the mind, to which if sides
be imputed, these must be the sides of
the object it constructively repre
sents."1
One could not have a better explana
tion, or so it seems to me, of the inex
tricable relation between concept and
word—the intangible and the con
crete.

are in truth no greater abstractions
than the abstract ideas in general as to
evolution and physical development
—e.g., Gravity, Matter, Force, on
which the exact sciences are based.
"The same idea of the reality of the
subjective and the unreality of the ob
jective universe is at the bottom of the
Pythagorean and Platonic teach
ings."1
Hence if the student of Telepathy
can accept the fact that the concept of
a word is the eternal verity, and the
word itself merely the effect of a cause,
he will see exactly why it is the image
conjured by the concept that will con
tact the mind—in itself an abstraction
—more readily than would a spoken
word.

It has been the misconception of
this fundamental idea which has
proved such a stumbling-block to all
progress in Telepathy.
One is apt to regard abstractions as
illusions, dreams, vapors, all that is
intangible and unperceived, whereas
in reality they are more real than the
ground upon which we walk.
Again I insist that when mind
reaches out to mind it must do so in
its own media, which most certainly
is not that of the objective world.
Symbolically then—I quote from
"The Secret Doctrine"— "the Equi

the phenomenal plane Father-Mother-

in the supersensuous world. This
symbol is demonstrated by the fact
that everywhere whither the foot of
ancient man has ever journeyed, one
finds the universal male and female
glyphs entwined in the Triangle and
the Square. Indeed, the use of geo
metrical figures and the frequent allu
sions to figures in all ancient scrip
tures, as in the Puranas, the Egyptian
Book of the Dead, and even the Bible,
must be explained by the fact that—

It has been proved that space is an

actually exist. What then is there to
keep mind from contacting mind in

Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Hence it is really not too much to
say that the material world and all it

There may be truths which exceed common-sense, but
there are none which contradict mathematics."
Eliphas Levi.

The Circle may be said to be the
symbol of the Universe and that is
why in a broad sense it typifies com
pletion and perfection. But for the
purpose of Telepathy let us consider it
somewhat in its relation to the limita
tions of the human race, which we
see in its circumscribed line of cir
cumference.

THE CIRCLE AND THE SQUARE 59
There is no denying the fact that as
human beings we are not wholly free
agents, although we may think we
are. For instance, we cannot change
the race into which we were born,
which may be black, white, yellow or
red. Neither can we change the par
ents to whom we have been assigned,
our caste or our heredity. Heine put
it very aptly when he wrote : "Already
in my cradle was the line of mark laid
down for all my life," and Schopen
hauer insists that while Will, as a
whole is free, it is only the "Universal
Will, and not that of mankind, which
circumstance and experience prove to
be confined within the circumscribed
line of the Circle."
A paradoxical figure indeed !

That
is,
it
may be said to symbolize
the perplexities and limitations of hu
man understanding and action on
earth, whereas throughout all space
it
is
the symbol of universal nature.
In other words, we may consider
the Circle as representing the All,
both in its relation to life and to hu
man destiny.
In describing the figures
I
am tak
ing into consideration the fact that
while their complexities do not wholly
apply to our present immature tele
pathic system, we must not lose sight
of the certainty that inevitably in the
course of time the "baby will grow

those who succeed us may be greatly
helped and encouraged by the infor

So while in Normal and Super
normal Telepathy I merely listed
the Circle as being a figure of com
pletion and of happy prospects, I am
now better qualified to present it and
all the various figures in a much more
diverse aspect.
Insofar as any mundane affairs are
concerned the above definition still
stands, and we sum up the Circle as
representing the happy attainment of
a life well spent on earth because,
when the Circle is complete every
debt of retribution shall have been
fully paid.
But even in the mundane aspect of
Telepathy it is important to remem

the invisible circles."1
We read also in "The Secret Doc
trine" of what is called the "Circle of
Necessity," and this would apply
largely to birth and re-birth on earth.
It is "based on the idea that all human
ity must pass through it by living
many lives, rewarded or punished by
such re-birth for the suffering en
dured or crimes committed in the for

It is well to mention the "Circle of
Necessity," although we shall not
have much use for it here. In human
as well as in Divine existence, there
can be neither accident nor chance.
So in the Circle we have primarily,
completion whether of a weary round
of births and deaths or of the move
ment of the planets, or the creation of
the universe. It may also be likened
to the well-known and greatly to be
desired "Wheel of Fortune," for cer

success, love, happiness, and hope.

and most sacred significance. As

In Telepathy of a mundane charac

will be demonstrated in Chapter VII,
it will be shown that all tenseness is
absolutely inimical to success. So in
telepathing I suggest actually facing
the north, south, east or west, as the
case may be. In this way much of the
natural tenseness due to space-con

with time and experience it will only
be necessary to visualize the figure,

of any kind. The thought creates the

of an unfolded cube. Of course there
are many, many kinds of crosses that
we might select, for it is the most an
cient of all the symbols and its origin
can be traced back into unfathomable
ages. Indeed, I doubt if the Cross
has not existed in some form or other
since the very beginning of time, and
I question if the world could have ex
isted at all without it. Certainly not

solid and impregnable. So while the
attributes and shape of the Cross are
subject to movement and change
throughout the course of evolution,
concurring with periods, races and
civilizations, the figure itself is as im
movable as the Cause from which it
primarily emerged.
In the four arms of the Cross, we
have also symbols of the four ele

well as the four cardinal points,
north, south, east and west, and of the
four seasons: spring, summer, au

THE POLYGON
The Polygon is usually drawn as a
plane-closed figure, having many an
gles and hence many sides, especially
one of more than four angles.
It is what might be termed a disin
tegrating figure.
Primarily it may be said to repre
sent an obstacle, or an obstruction,
though in its purely physical aspect
it points to hereditary deficiencies,
imperfect blood circulation, and
functional disorders of various kinds.
Consider its form. Its outline is
not symmetrical. It usually lacks
regularity of line or angle. It is an
emblem of general misfit due to cer
tain hereditary causes but not wholly

so because, while the Polygon may
and must be interpreted to apply to
defects of a functional nature, the
aftermath of these shortcomings are
often the outgrowth of the personal
application of a warped outlook on
life applied to material affairs, as well
as to the abuse of the physical body.
True, the Polygon-man has a sinis
ter background and the tools fur
nished him to hew out his material
destiny are not only inadequate but in
the main defective. On the other
hand, he may have a very high form
of intelligence which is generally
misdirected. And such would apply
to matters both of a moral and mate
rial nature.
He might choose the better way if
he wished to do so.

But he rarely does. The handicap
is too great, for the Polygon-man
clearly indicates spiritual as well as
moral defects passed on to an unfor
tunate being by ancestors of whom
the least said the better.
We can only explain this apparent
defect and injustice by the age-old
law of cause and effect.
The Polygon is no doubt a disinte
grating figure, though it does not nec
essarily spell disaster, and it certainly
affords a wide and useful experience
for humanity at large.
And is not wide and useful experi
ence an asset after all?
Telepathically, it may be summed
up to mean "fundamentally defect

A most mysterious and inexplicable
geometrical figure, the shape of which
is shown in the cut under Chapter IX.
It is like no other Cross I have ever
seen. Indeed, it appears a veritable
travesty of a Cross.
The top is formed by a reversed
Triangle. Thus, instead of construc
tive activity there is disintegration
and decay. It is a symbol of the
breaking up of all old conditions. The
base of the figure is a Polygon. It
stands square and firm and indicates
the irrevocability of the descent of
the human soul into matter and its
crucifixion thereby. The reversed

In mundane Telepathy it would

In a more general sense one sees
exemplified in it the dissolution of

government, creeds, all that concerns
the illusory existence of earth life and
physical institutions.
It is a significant and undeniable
fact that right down through the ages
the Cross has always stood a veritable
monument of sacrifice and pain. But,
added to this, in the Polygon Cross
we have structural deficiencies as well,

pointed Triangle, while those point
ing toward the earth are emblems of
water or the moist principle of water
and its ceaseless movement.
Another aspect of this Star is that
of magic.
Throughout the ages it has been
used as an insignia of ceremonial

In Chapter IX the figures listed
may all be telepathed in their Plane-
form as drawn, and there will be no
attempt made to transmit those de
scribed (and not listed) under the
chapter headed "Symbology," as these
would require wave-measurements.
Therefore I do not recommend them
for experimental purposes here as

something which is not and cannot be
perceived normally. Such as an ab
stract idea of a horse, or of a country,
or of a man. Words such as honesty,
truth, whiteness, and so on may be
telepathed. The codes should be
formed largely, if not exclusively, of
abstract words, because they create in
the contemplative mind the image
necessary to conform to the funda
mental requirements of any given
figure.

Telepathy are so vitally important to
its success, it is imperative that the
investigators should not confuse the
consciousness —or that crust of the
consciousness we habitually use—
with any of its vehicles, such as the
brain or the mind. For instance,
when the consciousness or the Self is
functioning in the mind—as it invari
ably does in Telepathy—it thinks a
Thought, so to speak. Thus the mind,
being the natural home of the Self,
the Thinker is imperishable, and it is
in no way affected even when the self-
consciousness is withdrawn at death.
All that happens
is,
that Normal Tel
epathy extends into Supernormal Tel
epathy, for the mind continues to
function although the brain and body
die.

The point I wish to stress is (as Mr.
Ouspensky so well expresses it in
"Tertium Organum") the following:
"It is necessary to regard conscious
ness as distinct from the com
monly understood psychic functions:
thought, feeling and sensation. Thus
consciousness —be it this or something
other—is a background upon which
thoughts, feelings and sensations re
veal themselves. This background
can be more or less bright. But as
thoughts, feelings and sensations have
their own separate life and can be re
garded independently of this back
ground, so can it be regarded and
studied independently of them.
"It is important only to establish the
fact that thoughts, feelings and sensa

The Lune Illusion. Change.
The Lune applies
chiefly to the feminine
sex and to the feminine
element in nature. It is a
very personal figure,
self-centered and somewhat caprici
ous and selfish. Insofar as material
affairs are concerned it symbolizes in
stability, change, reorganization, lack
of coordination, prudence, and espe
cially practicality. It may be said to
be capricious and unreliable in the
extreme; vague, dreamy, emotional,
and imaginative. It might be
chosen to represent either genius or
insanity. It is not dependable, wise,
nor can it be wholly trusted. Here
today, gone tomorrow, sums up the
nature of the Lune. Moon-people

The above examples will, I hope,

It is not sufficient merely to know
that a certain figure has manifested.
Of course that is the first essential.
The second is to be able to decipher
its content. Otherwise, what comes
will be somewhat similar to receiving
an empty trunk. This is only accom
plished after considerable practice.
But it can be accomplished. I know,
because I have done it many times.
However, you are not to expect your

without words, sound, or sight, the
recipient of a telepath merely knows

Thus the figures being so closely
entwined with our lives both spiritual
and physical we cannot extricate our
selves from their influence, try as we
may. Indeed they seem to be a part
of our Being.
It is true I have been advised to con

Because, I cannot lose sight of the
very pertinent fact that "before the

Hence our geometrical figures
have a deeply religious and metaphys

And so numbers lead into a very
labyrinth of mysticism. Indeed there
is more symbolism in numbers than
in aught else on earth.
Of course I realize that what I am
chiefly concerned in demonstrating is
the conceptual Idea behind words or
groups of words synthesized and in-
interpreted to convey short telepathic
messages. But to do so one must nec

Free translation of Review by Jean
Meyer :
" 'Normal and Supernormal Telepathy'
is a little book at once simple, modest, and
very, very interesting. It deals with the
transmission of thought between the living.
"The first chapter explains the thought-
wave. It insists upon a point never before
advanced and little known, which is that
'words cannot be telepathed; that the mes
sage must be sent in its appropriate geomet
ric form, because every thought of which
the human mind is capable has its root in
the geometric figure, which figure serves
as its vehicle of telepathic transmission.'
Here follows an explanation, very logical
and clear, illustrating the geometric se
quence found throughout all nature, and in
all creative thought. Then ensues a de
tailed list of geometric figures selected to
convey the telepaths indicated in the book.
