one of my first cases coming out of law
school was for NBC to establish the
right of journalists to protect their
confidential news sources I did the
amicus briefs for the New York Times and
The Washington Post and also for CBS and
ABC and it was at that time that I began
to realize that there was this close
working relationship between the board
of editors of the New York Times and the
national security community that there&#39;s
conversations going on all the time
between the the board of editors and the
national security people and we actually
got an affidavit from Teddy Sorensen
saying that oh yes the national security
statement CIA and everybody consult
regularly with the New York Times to get
them not to tell information about
covert operations that were engaged in I
was surprised to find that out at that
point I began to do an investigation
about this as lawyer for The Times now
in for NBC and found out that there were
42 full-time Central Intelligence Agency
or NSA people employed by the major
national news media and they had a whole
entire project called Project
Mockingbird and that they were deeply
embedded with it with the major national
news media and they were constantly from
their point of view safeguarding that
the information that was going to be
allowed to get out and it was quite
clear that they viewed themselves as all
part of the same basic fraternity they
all shared in the patriotic vision of
the Central Intelligence Agency being
able to go around the world the things
we had the biggest challenges with on
the Pentagon Papers case is they didn&#39;t
want to reveal the fact that there was a
massive assassination program going on
and it was being funded by heroin
trafficking you know to keep it away
from the congressional funding
investigations to Center I thought this
was terribly newsworthy think to tell
about but it was beyond the pale that
was not to be talked about here
you know you can talk about how bad the
Vietnam War was and even the fact that
they lied about the Bay of Tonkin
incident but not this
