the question of technology the
technology we&#39;re looking for we have a
couple of that are in pursuit close
pursuit or technologies that we know
there are thousands of inventors and
groups around the world over the years
who have been victimized by a new energy
suppression and the Federation of
American scientists in 2010 I wrote a
report on this their national security
project that over 5100 patents had been
seized dr. Tom Boland was witness to
this when he was at the Patent Office
and we have his interview however most
people in ever even gets to that they&#39;re
just working on something covert
programs monitoring as been rich of
Lockheed skunkworks says there are no
private conversations anywhere on earth
they go in and they just cease it or it
begins to emerge and it gets tied up in
a legal or business entanglement and
usually the business that is doing this
it&#39;s a front for the intelligence
community and/or the cartels involving
oil fossil fuels petro dollar
macroeconomic interests who want to keep
this secret so if you have been a victim
of this we want to hear from you just
like if you have been a victim of a
covert host abduction or mutilation
event if you have been a perpetrator
working on behalf of the US government
or a corporation to acquire these
technologies and keep them secret we
want you to come forward and tell your
truth and you will be protected as you
do this so those that&#39;s another category
witnesses we want now when we&#39;re talking
about a system that&#39;s operational we
have a team of people it&#39;s backed up out
of Europe by thousands of engineers and
if you have a legitimate operational
system or can build one up because you
done so in the past very quickly and by
very quickly I mean within the next
couple of months we require the
following it must be able to be
transparently tested and then from the
plans independently reproduced and
proven we are not interested in secret
black boxes at all you must be willing
to cooperate with a project of this
technology being open sourced and
provided to the world without patent or
intellectual property limits this does
not mean and this is the first time in
my 26 years I can state this listen very
carefully this does not mean that you
will not be compensated if you put your
life&#39;s work in this you will be
compensated and I&#39;m not going to talk
about numbers it&#39;s not appropriate but
let&#39;s just say any reasonable amount can
be Priven provided to you and then
lastly it has to be closed-loop what do
I mean by closed-loop it has to be
something that from the input power that
starts the technology whether it&#39;s a
battery or capacitor system or whatever
it is has to be run from the output
while the device is still carrying
running something in the real world with
wattage power a practical operating
system but it cannot be plugged in to a
wall if it&#39;s plugged into a wall it has
to be unplugged it has have a power up
unit that stays charged so it is a
free-standing continuously running over
Unity quote free energy system now free
energy is actually the wrong term
because you&#39;re actually pulling energy
from this almost infinite or perhaps
infinite field that Tesla described of
whether it&#39;s zero-point or quantum
vacuum you can argue about what it is
and the same thing with LAN R but it has
to be closed-loop it has to be
transparently tested and we must be able
to independently reproduce it at our
cause not yours
and you must cooperate with it being
massively disclosed our goal is at least
1 billion people will learn about this
system whatever
system is and I&#39;m fairly confident that
we can do this now the reason for that
is that once a hundreds of millions or a
billion or two people know about it
doesn&#39;t matter if the mainstream media
won&#39;t report it because their lackeys at
the of the agency the intelligence
community because with the social media
and the internet which was nowhere near
as developed in 2001 as it is now it
will be out there moreover we have
identified a number of household name
celebrities we&#39;re extremely interested
in this and who could have their home or
car running on such a system there&#39;s no
way to stop the public knowing about it
at that point
now this strategy is a complete sort of
an Aikido where you take the energy of
secrecy intellectual property the sort
of golem like my precious with the ring
and you just put it out to the public
and and this is completely frustrates
all the traps that are been set by the
corporate and intellectual property
patent and intelligence community to
seize and suppress these technologies we
have mapped out dozens of strategies
that those who want to keep these
technology secret have used and the
strategy we have developed will
frustrate all of them but it requires a
completely different thinking than what
is normally done in Silicon Valley for
example with intellectual property or
the new Apple iPhone is more secret than
the National Security Agency&#39;s
algorithms it is taking completely the
opposite approach where it&#39;s fully
disclosed massively the instant we prove
it is legitimate now that is key we do
not want to disclose something that is
not legitimate one last requirement the
technology must not have either a
extremely rare and therefore non
commercially viable materials in it
meaning that you can only make ten of
them in the world because we need a
billion of them
and it cannot have hazardous materials
in it or as a byproduct of its operation
including radioactive or other hazardous
materials so these are the criteria that
we are looking for so if you are
listening and you know someone who may
have this system the technology or you
yourself does please contact us at
energy in like en ERG y at serious
disclosure that come that&#39;s energy at
serious disclosure comm and we will get
back to you as soon as we can
