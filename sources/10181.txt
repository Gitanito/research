It was a balmy summer day with waves about three feet high. I had decided to go into the water, which was warm. I then went body surfing. I started tumbling under the water. I kept trying to right myself but could not. Suddenly, I was watching myself roll. I was not upset I felt peace. I was in a large expanse of black watching my life flash before me. I looked down and somehow I was righted upwards.
