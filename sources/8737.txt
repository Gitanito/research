  		      2837.        Douglas H NDEs       9/25/2011.      NDEs 6014.       From Canada      Then I became aware of something like a tunnel, and I remember feeling drawn toward it. I could see a small light at the end of the tunnel, and as I moved toward it, it seemed to get bigger. It looked just like a tunnel opening. As I entered the light, it felt like I became a part of it. The light felt like it passed right though my body, and when it did, it gave me such a good, calm feeling.  
   Two NDEs, both due to accidents.   

    2836.        Pauline L NDE       9/25/2011.      NDE 6012.       From the UK.      I then saw my grandson who hadn't been born yet. My daughter had been pregnant for just a couple of months, and we didn't know what sex the child was. He said to me, 'Gran gran, please go back, or I won't be born!' He held my hand and I felt the love. It was overpowering.  
   NDE due to brain hemorrhage. Remarkable conversation with unborn grandchild who told her to return to her earthly life or he would not be born. Awareness of five more children to be born in the future.   

    2835.        David D Probable NDE       9/25/2011.      Probable NDE 6010.             I had a serious liver disease and I was taken to the hospital by my sister. I heard them tell her that I did not have long to live. I saw a priest and nun over me, giving me Last Rites. I went to another place.  About as much as I can say about it is that it wasn't our world, although it was in the same location. The presence of Jesus within a mist, or cloud, was all around me. I was told He had things for me to do. Still in that other world, I was introduced to all the other patients on the floor. When I awoke the next day, I knew everyone's names. They thought I was nuts, or looked like they did, anyway.  
   Probable NDE due to severe liver disease.   

    2834.        Donna NDE       9/25/2011.      NDE 6008.             I said to myself, 'Huh, I thought that one was supposed to last longer', and headed up in a light cloud. It felt so perfect. I felt like I was going home and I felt comfortable and joyous with no doubts at all. It was like every cell of my body was happy and light and felt right and I have never felt so accepted.  
   NDE from criminal attack.  Remarkable apparent life-saving Divine intervention, and apparent hellish NDE immediately following in her attacker (the attacker’s second hellish NDE)   

    2833.        Sandra Z NDE       4/16/2011.      NDE 22555.             Instantly, I was standing behind myself. I saw my dad jump up and I saw my own body leaning back in the chair.  I saw my little sister fly off my lap into the counter and into the person sitting in front of me. On the floor to my left, there was a little kids' block with the letter A on it, and as I watched myself faint, I could see that my body, or my head, WAS going to hit that block. I thought, ‘That is going to hurt!’ Next, my dad was on top of me, smacking and shaking me. I came back into my body. When I looked up and saw my dad, I reached behind my head and there was the block.  At that time, I could only cry, because I was so confused, having no real knowledge of these things or of God. There is no way anyone can tell me that this did not happen. I was a innocent child. Much later, I told my father the truth, and he understood completely.  
   NDE at age 10 due to loss of consciousness from unknown illness.   

    2832.        Kelly S Possible NDE       9/18/2011.      Possible NDE 6002.             We were just getting close enough to hear this wonderful music, when the entity said it was time for me to decide to go back or to go forward.  I had just had the thought that my husband would not begrudge me this chance, when I was yanked back and slammed back into this world, with bright lights and pain.  
   Possible NDE due to experience while under general anesthesia.   

    2831.        Angela Probable FDE       9/18/2011.      Probable FDE 6000.       From Canada      There were no words spoken at any point.  Although I know these were a male presence, I remember not being able to see their faces. I distinctly remember feeling a hand, a physical hand, on my own, and feeling that my life was now spared, that I was now safe. Once on the shore, I remember looking back into the water and along the shoreline. There was no one there except for people visible off in the distance and back at the hotel.  
   Probable fear death experience and STE during life-threatening risk of drowning.   

    2830.        Fergus NDE       9/18/2011.      NDE 5371.       From Ireland.          I could clearly see myself on the gurney and three nurses shouting and slapping me. I could feel the dread of one of the nurses as she called for something. I was not feeling any pain at all, as I watched them trying to revive me. When they started using a defibrillator on me, my body felt nothing. But with every hit of the defibrillator paddles, I could feel myself being sucked closer and back into my body.  
   NDE due to suicide attempt.   

    2829.        Lexy Probable NDE       9/18/2011.      Probable NDE 5370.       From Bavaria.      In the beginning, the tunnel was glowing gently, but then it became more and more intense and bright. I experienced a feeling of depth and dimension. My speed increased as I approached the light at the end of the tunnel. The intensity of the colors deepened. In addition, I was now full of an expectant joy. A sense of warmth penetrated me, through and through.  
   Probable NDE at age six in association with ether anesthesia for surgery.   

    2828.        Francisco R NDE       9/17/2011.      NDE 5330.       From Columbia. Original in Spanish. Translated to English by Maria.      In that precise moment, I started to see myself from above. There was no pain any more, no cold, no hunger only tranquility and an immense peace. I saw my body being hurt by the electric current, but I did not care at all. The feeling of peace was so overwhelming that I did not need anything from this world. I realized that I was dead and that my body was just another nail that had fallen. I understood I had neither body nor eyes but my consciousness was intact, and I felt I could perceive the world with something close to omniscience; it was as if I knew everything. Then I started to leave. I could see the universe very far away at the end of a tunnel. Then I had this feeling ’wait a minute, I am dying and I have had no sons nor have I had a girlfriend and I wanted to have all that!’ I did not want to die without having had a full life!  
   Teenage NDE from electrocution.     

    2827.        Marsy C Probable NDE       9/14/2011.      Probable NDE 5307.       Original in French. Translated to English by Jean Peter.      The problem was that I did not know when to push. I was extremely tired just lying there quietly. After a moment, I felt I was out of my body. This was an unfamiliar feeling, extremely weird. I was conscious, I saw myself on the delivery table, and my husband was next to me. I could see the midwife and I could see that the weather was good out the window. But I was/felt out of my body, as if my body were separated from my soul. It seemed as though my body and soul was two different things; my body was below and I was above, seeing everything. The room was very bright.  
   Beginnings of a probable NDE from childbirth complications.   

    2826.        Glenna C NDE       9/10/2011.      NDE 5367.             I had this real sharp pain. It was just not going away – I could not even breathe. I'm telling you, this pain was so great that I knew I was having a heart attack !!!  I could not even reach the phone to call for help. 'This is it,' I thought. 'I'm going to die here by myself.'  The pain was getting worse and worse, and soon I could not even breathe. Then there was this real bright light. I had never seen anything like it before!  It was so soft!  I was drawn to it.  I remember there was this guy whose face I could not see.  But I knew him, and he knew who I was.  As I looked around, I saw people sitting in this room that was like a tunnel.  They all knew who I was, but I didn't know them. Either that or I could not tell who they were, for they had no faces, or maybe their faces were just in shadow from the bright light.  They were talking to me, asking me questions, asking me why don't. I just stay here.  
   NDE due to heart attack.   

    2825.        Kristy G NDE       9/10/2011.      NDE 5366.             I was a passenger in a car and we were hit head-on by another vehicle. I remember seeing its headlights coming towards us. I was talking on the phone with my mom at the time and we were arguing about something. I just felt really still for a minute, then I saw a long dark tunnel with a light at the end and I walked through it. I saw my body in the car and felt my sister tug on my hair saying, ‘Kristy, don't leave me. I need you.’ So, I returned. I did not want to leave. I went back into my body and my eyes did not feel like my eyes any more, they felt ‘different’ (I have been legally blind since birth). I went to the emergency room and just wanted to sleep. The doctor said I had a mild concussion and a broken collar bone.  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    2824.        Deborah D Probable NDE       9/10/2011.      Probable NDE 5364.             As soon as I remembered whatever it was I heard a sound and I knew from the sound that I was dying as I traveled down a tunnel. At first, it was dark as I continued to hear the sound but then I saw a small bright light come closer to me and get brighter. More than bright light, I knew it was GOD. The further I traveled the warmer and happier I felt. I was going towards the bright light. It is where I wanted to be. There were people there on my right side that knew me. It felt like I knew everyone. They were talking to me without words. They told me I did not belong there but I wanted to stay.  
   Probable NDE due to nitrous oxide overdose for dental surgery.   

    2823.        Michaele S NDE       9/10/2011.      NDE 5363.             We were 'moving' through a vastness (I have no other word for it) and it is at this point that language is just not enough.   The vastness was not empty and yet it was! We arrived at what the being said (with a wave of his arm) was Love. ‘This is Love. It is always here, always streaming toward you, never diminishing, always loving you. All you have to do is be open to it. Receive it. This will heal you’. In that moment, I thought it meant my body healing. It did mean that but it was also about so much more and I learned this in the years following my experience. I have never found a way to truly describe what I saw there and resort to the only explanation I can give for something that defies our limited language. LOVE was boundless yet contained no color and all color, nothing and all things, it was tangible, dense, mysterious, and light. It was everything and nothing. It was an actual presence but not personality. It was all shape and no shape. I felt so joyous in the most peaceful quiet way, very grounded and accepting.     
   Remarkable NDE due to car running into a moving train.   

    2822.        Catherine M Probable NDE       9/10/2011.      Probable NDE 5362.             I was able to see it for a second, and realize that they were all pictures of my life. I don't remember what the picture was that helped me realize this. Something tells me that it was a picture of me and a family member when I was a small child, but I have no evidence or remembrance to back this up, I just remember thinking that.    
   Probable NDE at age 17 due to passing out from alcohol intoxication and hitting head.   

    2821.        Barbara E NDE       9/10/2011.      NDE 5361.             As I settled into the love without condition, I realized more and more how utterly and absolutely intelligent light was. The sheer level of creativity and intellect was emotionally and psychologically beyond comprehension. I knew that because light was telepathically melded with me, allowing me to sense at least a minute degree of what was contained within. There was so much thought and information that it felt as if zillions of scrolls of data about the true nature of reality just kept unraveling. I was lost and overwhelmed and had no comprehension of what it all meant. Yet the central message came through loud and clear. Reality is SO much larger, multi-layered and multi-dimensional than we realize. Consciousness is able to experience so much more than what we commonly practice. Everything has purpose and meaning.  
   NDE due to unconsciousness at time of illness.   

    2820.        Angela E NDE       9/10/2011.      NDE 5360.             They said to me, 'you are not supposed to be here.'  I got a little scared at that time and thought I was going to get in trouble. There was a door there; it was closed. I remember someone opened it and I was so excited to see that person. They seemed full of love and kindness. That person that opened the door made me feel safe. They called for someone else to come through it. They then closed it back.  I remember sitting there and getting a bit anxious for it to be my turn to go through it.  
   NDE at age 4 due to unconsciousness secondary to likely near heat stroke.   

    2819.        Margaret V NDE       9/10/2011 &amp; 10/16/2010.      NDE 5358/4844.       From Canada.      I was brought into the ER by ambulance. I don't remember very much. I do remember being in the hospital and being brought into a room. I was there only a few minutes, or so I thought.  I remember being aware that my chest was feeling different from usual.   I also remember that, at the time, I was wondering if it was my body that I was looking down on because I was also looking around and seeing no one. I said, 'Um hum, I don't know where everyone is but something is happening here. I don't feel right.'  Next thing I see is that I am in a dark room. It wasn't round, it wasn't square; it was just very, very warm, very beautiful, and very, very black.  
   NDE due to heart attack.   

    2818.        Karen M NDE       9/10/2011.      NDE 5357.             Off in the distance I could see a light. As I watched, it started moving towards me, getting closer and closer. I actually cannot say if I was moving towards it, or if it was coming towards me. But I do remember that I was not afraid, in spite of the strangeness of what was happening. I could feel the warmth from the light, which was not like any light I had ever seen before. It was bright, but at the same time, it didn't hurt my eyes as I looked into it.  I felt happy and unafraid. The light had just come to the point where it was starting to surround me, when it started to back away.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest during emergency c'sarian section surgery.   

    2817.        Regina D NDE       9/10/2011.      NDE 5354.             It is difficult for me to describe what I saw. My view bobbed up and down as if I were floating. It didn't look like a color, or a black and white, video. There were bits of color but the lines between colors were not totally clear. It was almost like a fuzzy picture with the different colors floating and bobbing around. There was a lot of commotion and noise that seemed to be muffled.  
   NDE at age 6 due to drowning.   

    2816.        Tracy D NDE       9/10/2011.      NDE 5352.             He looked so perfect, and so at peace. I can't really describe how awesome, calm, and perfect he looked. When he passed, he was 73 years old and all grey beard and moustache. As he appeared before me, he was much younger: in his prime with thick, wavy, bright deep red hair, as he had when he was younger, only much more vivid and intense. Any imperfection or flaw he had was sculptured, chiseled away, to a smooth perfection. HE LOOKED PERFECT, BEAUTIFUL AND CONSUMED WITH PEACE AND JOY AND OVERFLOWING WITH UNDERSTANDING AND LOVE (I could go on and on).  
   Remarkable NDE. Met deceased father- contributor had to make a difficult decision to end life support for his father. His father directly addresses this.  A must read for anyone who has struggled with end of life decisions for a loved one.   

    2815.        Oscar O NDE       9/10/2011.      NDE 5350.             I remember when I stood before my biologic father for getting into some mischief.  I had a sense of dread and fear because I knew the circumstance was going to earn me a spanking.  But this review with the light never once did I have this same sense of fear, it was as though I was being shown what happened in that scene and then what the outcome was.  
   NDE due to drowning at age 11. Encounter with Jesus and life review.   

    2814.        Adam N NDE       9/10/2011.      NDE 5349.             I was above my body looking down at it.  I saw him and what he was doing to me. He was yelling and shaking me and telling me to wake up. My lips looked very blue and dark. Even though I wasn't in my body anymore, I felt like I could feel my heart stop. It was calming as soon as the beating ceased. I was exactly who I am now only without a body. Everything was the same, but I was just a consciousness, not a body.  
   NDE due to drug overdose.   

    2813.        Jason P FDE       9/10/2011.      FDE 5346.             I floated there bordering on consciousness in a huge pool of blood until I was poked by a huge tiger shark. Then the shark poked me again. That's when I had a life review, and was lifted out of the water by a faceless, glowing entity, and flown to shore in an instant. No one ever saw the entity but me.  
   Fear-death experience at age 14 due to surfing accident and encounter with a shark.   

    2812.        Anne-Cécile NDE       9/7/2011.      NDE 5296.       From France.  Original in French, translated to English by Simon A.      I left my body.  I was drawn, sucked, through a passage, like a tunnel, towards an intense white light. The space was not wide, but it was like a roadway.  I was following along it towards the light. Suddenly I had a thought about my boyfriend, with whom I was in love. Immediately, I found myself back in my body in my car.  
   NDE from car accident.   

    2811.        Julianna NDE       8/28/2011.      NDE 5345.             I then became aware of being surrounded by a bright white light. I found myself standing on one side of a canyon that stretched out as far as I could see, to the right and to the left of me. Looking down, as far down as I could see, it was all pitch black. I noticed that the source of the light seemed to be on the other side of the canyon. It seemed so close, and yet there was no way for me to get to it. I began to panic. I wanted so badly to be one with the light.  
   NDE due to heroin overdose at age 16.   

    2810.        Roberta W Probable NDE       8/28/2011.      Probable NDE 5344.             I was pulled from my body.  I understood that I was no longer in my body and at the same time I felt a physical resistance to leaving it as I knew that it meant that I was dying. I went through the typical tunnel experience with the light pulling me.  My arrival at the light was a mind-blowing love that I recognized as God.  Then I experienced a mind transfer of information through telepathy and I understood that when we die, we understand everything, which is so very simple that I did not want to leave.  
   Probable NDE during emergency c'sarian section surgery.   

    2809.        Sally E NDE       8/28/2011.      NDE 5343.             I was aware of everything going on in the ambulance, but at the same time, I was in a long hallway.  It reminded me of a hotel hallway, because I was aware of doors all along both sides.  At the end of the hallway was one door that had such a bright light behind it, the rays were seeping out on all sides of the door.  I had no body; just a consciousness.  Then there was a great roaring sound (like a jet plane, just before it begins to go down the runway) and I was suddenly traveling at an unbelievable rate of speed towards the door at the end of the hallway.  
   NDE due to pulmonary embolus.   

    2808.        Karen O Possible NDE       8/28/2011.      Possible NDE 5342.       From the UK.      I was walking toward a beautiful, bright, white light. There were hundreds of people of all denominations walking with me. I wasn't scared; in fact, I felt euphoria and excitement.  It was as if we were on a path, or road. Different colored bright lights were rushing past me, and it was like walking out of a dark tunnel. The next minute, I felt like I woke up on some beautiful green grass that went on for miles and miles. To my right was a river and to my left was a wooden fence that also went on for miles.  
   Possible NDE due to suicide attempt   

    2807.        Donna G Probable NDE       8/28/2011.      Probable NDE 5340.             After many tests to find the hole in my small intestine, I was rushed into emergency surgery at 11:00 pm to repair both the small intestine and the bladder.  As the surgery was ending, my heart raced and then almost stopped. I was on a respirator for twelve hours and in intensive care for a full day. I found myself standing outside the archway of a living room area. (There was no door.) Inside was a sofa. Sitting on the sofa was my grandmother. Standing next to her, talking to her, was my sister Barbara, who passed away last year from colon cancer.  Standing next to her, was my twin sister Diane, who had died at birth when we were born. (The cord had been wrapped around her neck and the doctors could not save her.) Except Diane was not a baby here; she was a grown adult.  
   Probable NDE from surgical complications.   

    2806.        Jack B NDE       8/28/2011.      NDE 5338.             Suddenly, I found myself landing in the sand on an ocean shore. I got up and saw this long bridge in front of me. It looked like it was miles long but it only took me a few steps to cross it. When I got to the end, a man, who seemed to be my grandfather, was standing there. He told me, 'You just need to finish what's started, so get busy.'  
   NDE due to fall and head injury.   

    2805.        Giselle L NDE       8/20/2011.      NDE 5334.             This tunnel was amazing. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It was alive. It was energy, and its color was bright blue! A living framework, geometrically perfect lines, synchronized, moving lines that spun inside each other. So beautiful!  I zipped through it and ended up in the void again, where I found myself staring through a square-shaped hole. I was staring at myself while the doctor and nurses were trying to revive me. I don't like to call what I experienced 'emotion'. My body seemed to be free from all emotion. The word I would choose would be 'bliss'.  
   NDE due to alcohol poisoning.   

    2804.        Ozzie F NDE       8/20/2011.      NDE 5332.             As I stood on my side of the perfectly clear stream that was meandering crystal-clear water over the rocks, I noticed that my place of waiting was like the pasture field on the other side of the stream—beautiful flowers and grass carpeted. When I commenced walking down to cross the small creek to greet and hug Mommy and Sister Bonnie, my sister said, 'Not now Bubby, don’t cross over yet.'  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    2803.        Henrietta K NDE       8/20/2011.      NDE 5331.             I am not sure if I realized it at the beginning, or if I was made aware of it at some point later in the experience, but I was possessed by an insanely intense desire to reach an impossibly bright light that I could see at the end of this canyon. That light seemed to be the source of all the light, all the love, all the goodness, pleasure and peace in all of existence. It was the source of everything. It seemed to be the only thing that had ever mattered. It was contained within everything, it united everything and I was drawn to it as if by a powerful magnet.  
   NDE due to faint and apparent seizure.   

    2802.        Storm Possible NDE       8/20/2011.      Possible NDE 5326.             There was no sound whatsoever. I saw what appeared to be a castle in the distance. It looked like it was made of white, light pink and powered blue sand. There was a drawbridge connected to this castle. I saw Jesus and John the Baptist walking down the bridge reading a scroll, deep into conversation with each other.( at 4 years old I may have known who Jesus was by a picture in our house, but not John the Baptist) I tried to wave Jesus down while running through the clouds. He did not look up at me at all. He waved his hand in my direction as if to say 'Not yet, you are not supposed to be here.'  
   Possible NDE associated with fever at age 4.   

    2801.        Beckie W NDE       8/20/2011.      NDE 5325.             The next thing I knew, I was sitting next to someone way above myself. We were looking down on the operating room where the doctor and six other people were working on me. I remember seeing the light shining on me.  I remember the doctors in white. The person next to me had their arm around me telling me everything was going to be OK.  
   NDE due to cut with blood loss at age 5.   

    2800.        Kelly D NDE       8/20/2011.      NDE 5323.             I had no sense of my body, including my neck, and I saw nothing at first, but I heard music which sounded like the most beautiful laughter of children or I thought, 'angels; the cherubim!' It was more beautiful than any music I had ever heard on earth and I felt that the angels laughed when good things happened on earth.  I felt this was the music of the spheres.  The angels (whom I never saw) were like petals of the Rose that enfolded me with love.  I felt safe, free and certain that this was the gateway to Heaven.  I cannot describe the utter joy and peace.  
   NDE due to car accident.   

    2799.        Donna K FDE       4/5/2011.      FDE 22536.       From Canada      Then they showed me ‘my’ experiences in literally a flash.  I saw my birth, and every moment of my life concurrently - not a slideshow really, but my entire life was visible.  I was shown various things in the normal world (don't know where we were though...), and saw so much more than what I normally see.  The colors were incredibly visible, and every object, leaf, breath was ‘visible’ - I could see everything ‘vibrating’ - it was as though rocks, leaves, the ground, the air - everything was ‘alive.’  
   Fear-death experience with detailed life review and spiritual insights.   

    2798.        Darla M Probable NDE       7/3/2011.      Shared Death Experience 16053.      This light was always visible, even though we were twisting and turning. The light got very bright and large as if the tunnel was ending. And that is all I remember.  I believe I took my baby to heaven. That is why I changed ‘I’ to ‘we’ above.  One of my twins died sometime before the sonogram, and the other twin died shortly after delivery. Yes, I do have the sense that I had him cupped in my hands. I couldn't see what was in my hands, though, I just had this feeling that as I was racing through this tunnel, my whole focus and all my attention was on protecting what I was carrying cupped in my hands. 
   Short shared death experience.   

    2797.        Magdalena M NDE       8/17/2011.      NDE 5294.       From Mexico      I could make out a golden light at the end of the tunnel, like a beautiful sunset. I felt flighty, light and very happy, more peaceful than I ever had in my life.  As I was approaching the light, I could see something like several silhouettes waiting for me.  It was all peace and happiness, but suddenly I could not go forward any more. I felt like something was stopping me and then something was grabbing my hand. I thought of my baby and of my other two daughters.  
   From Mexico, Original in Spanish. NDE from childbirth complications.   

    2796.        Christal NDE       8/13/2011.      NDE 5322.             It was dark in the 'well,' but there was a light (this sounds so lame!) at the top of it. As the light grew brighter, I could make out some people, sort of leaning over, peering in. I saw three of my grandparents. There were two other people who don't seem familiar to me now, but I remember knowing who they were at the time. I felt happy and very glad to see them. They spoke to me, but not with their mouths. I can't remember what they said. I reached my hand up as if to let them pull me out, but my grandmother scolded me, 'Not yet!' she said.  
   NDE due to apparent respiratory arrest during illness.   

    2795.        Lynn R NDE       8/13/2011.      NDE 5320.             I leaned back in a relaxing position, expecting to see my biological Dad, who had passed away a few years earlier, to walk through the curtain and take my hand and lead me through the curtain. I felt certain he was just on the other side of the curtain, (or cocoon like material) and I was content to wait on him to put in an appearance. As I waited for what seemed days, (although I wasn't impatient - just content to be waiting.) I finally looked to my left and downward. I saw my husband standing with my children and son-in-law, who was holding my one grandchild.  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    2794.        Shane J NDE       8/13/2011.      NDE 5317.             I was standing in a field except the 'grass' was like lit up like fiber optics with a bright light on the horizon. I could hear what was going on in the emergency room but, when I looked back, I could not see the emergency room.  
   NDE due to respiratory arrest.   

    2793.        Kay NDE       8/13/2011.      NDE 5315.       From Australia.      I fainted, and next thing I knew, I was in another place. It was a white room, and I was sitting on a box covered in white shag pile carpet.  The door to the left was shut.  I could hear kids playing outside. I had no pain, felt happy and relaxed. I was talking to someone, but I could not tell you whom it was. I got the impression that they didn't expect me there, as the person I was talking to was coming through a door. The door opened to me, and all I could see was bright light!  But then, here on Earth, I heard my brother start to talk to me. He put a cold cloth on my head, and I was back.  
   NDE from fainting.   

    2792.        Helen J Probable NDE       8/13/2011.      Probable NDE 5314.       From the UK.      They came to take me to the operating room.  I felt scared.  My chances of survival were 50-50.  During the operation, I suddenly found myself in this awful blackness.  I felt sick with fear.  It felt evil.  I felt as though I was being dragged backwards down a flight of stairs and my head bounced down each step.  
   Probable NDE apparently while under anesthesia.  Hellish experience.   

    2791.        Charmaine M NDEs       8/13/2011.      NDE 5313.       From the UK.      I followed her again, and this time the experience seemed longer. I met more family members who had passed away, and pets from childhood. I saw amazing flowers that were bigger than we have on earth, and fields of green and blue seas. I also got to see my Mother who was still alive, because I wanted to go home. My Gran said that I only had to think of her, and I would be with her. She could not see me, but I could see her. Again, I was told that this was not my time to die and was taken back to my body. The men who had beaten me were scared and said, 'She is a witch'.  
   NDE due to criminal attack.   

    2790.        Jeff L NDE       8/13/2011.      NDE 5306.             I remember all this as clearly as if it were yesterday. Suddenly, I was looking down at the room from the ceiling, and could see the couch where my parents were talking, the table in front of them, the desk, and the general layout of the room.  My father got up and (I later realized) pulled me out from under the desk by my legs. That was the end of that memory.  
   NDE from electrocution at age 3-4.   

    2789.        Eloise S NDE       8/6/2011.      NDE 5305.             When I turned my head to look at the heart monitor, I realized that I was not breathing any more. I was above my body, up near the ceiling in a different dimension. It was like looking out at a 3D glass window. I tried to figure out what was happening, as I looked at my body below me.  
   NDE at childbirth.   

    2788.        Karen G Mother NDE       8/6/2011.      Secondhand NDE 5304.             It got fuzzy as she seemed to be passing through the ceiling and she could look up at a light. But it wasn't a LIGHT.  It was like an openness; an awakening that her brain registered as a light. She said it felt it was like going home and she felt really good. But then she started to panic. My dad was in Korea and she was worried about who would take care of me on earth. The next thing she knew, she was slammed back into her body.  
   Daughter shares mother's NDE due to cardiac arrest during surgery.   

    2787.        Ellen A Probable NDE       8/6/2011.      Probable NDE 5302.             All of a sudden, I looked over to the ceiling corner of my curtained cubicle; there appeared in 3D color my beloved Dad and brother Joe - both deceased. They were in the form of a HOLOGRAM - transparent but vivid and pretty much life size (maybe a bit smaller). They said nothing, showed no expression, and just looked down at me. Now I was really happy! In my mind I would say they were there for minutes - but who knows.  
   Probable NDE due to blood loss from miscarriage.   

    2786.        Joe W NDE       8/6/2011.      NDE 5301.             My grandfather told me that they appeared that way to me because I would not recognize them in their spirit form. They disappeared and within the cloud, I saw ‘swirling clouds’. I felt a presence in there and tried to clarify whom it was. I could not see a face but felt the presence of Jesus on a throne. I said ‘who are you?’ He replied ‘I am your Lord Jesus ’and I fell to my knees. Jesus said ‘Don't be afraid, I love you’.  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    2785.        Mitchell M NDE       8/6/2011.      NDE 5300.             Suddenly I was high up in the air.  I could see myself floating face down.  I could see my cousin waving his arms and yelling for help, and my dad running toward the water.  I also saw another man jump up and run toward the water.  At that point, I remember thinking that I really wanted to tell my dad not to be so scared, because I was in a safe place.  Then my favorite grandma, who had died several years before, was next to me.  I didn't see her; I just knew she was there.  She said, 'You have to go back, Mitchell, you can't be here yet.'  
   NDE at age 11 due to drowning.  Shared 52 years later.   

    2784.        Kathryn A NDE       8/6/2011.      NDE 5299.             I began to ask, ‘How do I get out of here?  I am so happy to be home!  Get me out of this car!’ I was lovingly told that I had more work to do. I was specifically instructed to take off my seat belt and get out of the car. I was shown something that appeared to me only in my thoughts for that moment, and that gave me the desire to return. I took off my seat belt and crawled through the space where the window used to be. As I began to rise, I asked, ‘How long do I have to hold my breath?’ and immediately the answer came, ‘As long as it takes.’  
   NDE due to car crash with car ending upside down at bottom of stream.  Remarkable for angelic intervention that probably saved her live.   

    2783.        Sabrina E Probable NDE       8/6/2011.      Probable NDE 5298.             I had a bleed on the brain, died and went to Heaven. There, I saw a lot of lights. The souls of those gone before me were the lights. It was like a room carpeted all over with lights. Way up front, there was God! My daughter stood behind God.  She had passed about three years before. I made my way through the lights, and when I got up to the front, the Lord spoke to me. He said, 'I just wanted you to see that I have her and that she is fine.'  
   Probable NDE due to what is described as bleeding on the brain.   

    2782.        Curtis M NDE       8/6/2011.      NDE 5297.             The next thing I knew I was looking down at myself watching the chaos, hearing my name. Then there was light, a wonderful bright light. I was moving towards this bright light. I wasn't cold anymore. I was at ease. I saw figures and heard familiar voices. One in particular was my Grandmother telling me I needed to go back and that my family needed me. Then there was a feeling of calm. A hand touched my shoulder and I felt extreme love. I looked in the direction of the hand and a man's voice spoke. It was the most calming, loving voice. She is right my son. You must go back. You are needed. I didn't want to leave.  
   Heart stopped following back surgery.   

    2781.        Tanya NDE       8/6/2011.      NDE 5295.             Suddenly, I felt my body relax completely. Surrounded by darkness, I heard beautiful, gothic-type music, like angels singing. I felt myself floating – completely at peace – so happy!  
   NDE due to asthma and allergic reaction.   

    2780.        Emily R NDE       2/6/2011.      NDE 22524.             They rolled me into the operating room. The next thing I remember, I saw my body on the table. Then I was in this dark room. I started to turn my head around and that's when I saw the light. I tried to drag my hand and my body toward the light. The next thing I remember, I was in the recovery room. Next, the nurse started pushing the bed toward my room. My daughter was explaining to me what had happen, but I wasn't paying attention. The next morning, I felt so at peace. I was in a daze! The doctor came in and explained what had happen to me. He said, ‘The surgery went well, but there was a problem getting the trachea out of your mouth.’ I had died but started breathing again on my own. I was very much at peace while he was talking to me, but also in a daze. In three days, I requested to go home.  While at home, I started to remember. It was like a flash.  
   NDE due to surgical complication.  Shared about three weeks after experience.   

    2779.        Maria Teresa Possible NDE       7/31/2011.      Possible NDE 5282.       From Italy      I suddenly found myself running down a long black tunnel. In fact, this was my soul leaving my body, running fast inside this tunnel so I could reach a white light, a bright ring. The very moment I reached the light, I turned around and, retracing my steps, ran back through the tunnel at the same speed, until I reached where I had started - only to turn around again and run back down the tunnel towards the light.  
   Teenage Possible NDE due to surgery complications.   

    2778.        Art J NDE       7/30/2011.      NDE 5290.             The next thing I remember is looking at myself and seeing a bluish aura. I looked, I think, straight ahead and saw what looked like a rough cave. It was too dark to see to the end.  Around me was darkness. Although at that point I couldn't move, I could see the sides of the cave. It was pitch black but I could see a cloaked figure with its hood down to its chest. It lifted its, I think, hand, draped in the cloak's sleeve and pointed at me what looked like an abnormally long finger made of, I think, bone, and said, 'You.'  
   NDE at age 8 due to choking.  He's age 15 now.   

    2777.        Burt G NDE       7/30/2011.      NDE 5289.             What I realized was that my dog's feeling of bewilderment was the same bewilderment I felt, looking down at my own body! After a second or so, a sense of peace overcame all my emotions, and I knew I was looking at my now lifeless body. I did not care! It was a relief to know it was over. I knew I was very near Heaven - but almost instantly, I knew I could not stay there.  
   NDE due to advanced Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.   

    2776.        Cate NDE       7/30/2011.      NDE 5288.             The moment my heart stopped the void became deeper and deeper, until it felt like it expanded forever. I sensed that the darkness was about to part and reveal a marvelous light.  Then I felt the presence of my deceased grandfather. I don't remember everything that was said, but basically it was revealed that I could move on if I wanted to, but once I reached the light I would not be able to return to my body. He did not want my life to end though, because I still had some important lessons to be learned in this lifetime. He said that after I learned what I needed to about love that it would be my time to go.  
   NDE due to apparent medication reaction.  Remarkable for awareness her life had been saved multiple times in her earthly life.  Remarkable also for awareness of two men who died in a car accident- she became aware of and confirmed details of the accident.   

    2775.        Tallulah F NDE       7/30/2011.      NDE 5287.             Then I realized I was outside my body looking down on myself. People were coming in and I could not get their attention. I realized I was slowly losing my senses like vision, hearing, etc. and things began to fade.  Suddenly I was moving at a high rate of speed up a tunnel or vortex. Far up ahead I could see a very bright light and it felt like the most beautiful feeling I've ever had as I moved toward it. I got close enough to the light to make out a doorway and the light I was seeing was spilling out from the door, which was only partially open. The door closed and I was in darkness till I came too in the ambulance.  
   NDE due to accident.   

    2774.        Donna M NDE       7/30/2011.      NDE 5286.             When I awoke, I was above looking down at my body with emergency medical technicians and other friends I knew. I spoke to someone asking, 'Why are they crying?' I don't know who it was that I spoke to, nor did I see them. The voice said they were crying over me because I was in a car accident. I kept asking, 'Why?' I didn't feel pain, actually I felt peaceful.  
   NDE due to auto accident at age seventeen.   

    2773.        Stephen Girlfriend Probable NDE       7/23/2011.      Probable NDE/Shared Death Experience 5285.       From the United Kingdom      During the operation, she remembers, she saw me at my home, lying on my bed, and she called out to me by name. Now û at this exact same moment, I was indeed lying on my bed, just dozing a little, when I was awakened, startled by someone shouting my name. I ventured out onto my stairway landing to see who was calling, but nobody was there. I went back to lying on the bed.  Over the next few days, I was able to speak to her and was brought up to date on all that had happened.  A strongly surreal moment for me was when she said, 'I saw you lying down on your bed, and I called out to you.' I exclaimed, 'Oh my God, I heard you call! How can that be? You were 20 miles away!'  
   Probable NDE due to emergency surgery for ectopic pregnancy.  Remarkable OBE with her boyfriend hearing her when she was OBE in his room.   

    2772.        Paul P NDE       7/23/2011.      NDE 5284.             I left my body and went up a tunnel toward a beautiful golden light.  I was in the presence of a spiritual being, Jesus.  He told me that it was not time for me to stay there and that I would go back, that my mom needed me. He told me other things that I cannot remember.  I remember being in the hospital room and realizing that I was not in my body.  I remember seeing a baby. I no longer felt sick or scared. It was very peaceful, and I knew I would be okay.  
   NDE due to congenital heart problem at age 7 weeks.  One of the earliest age NDE ever recorded.   

    2771.        Antonio J NDE       7/23/2011.      NDE 5276.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated by Simon A.      Succumbing to shock after taking drugs combined with strong medication, I lost consciousness and suddenly found myself observing something which was revolving. The most important thing was, wrapped in an incredible peacefulness; I thought to myself, 'So this would be the other life.' And I felt no sadness on that account.  
   NDE from going unconscious from strong drugs.   

    2770.        Colin S Probable NDE       7/17/2011.      Probable NDE 5281.       From Holland.      It was quiet; I heard no sound of any kind. The image faded and I don't know how long I stood there, or what happened next.  
   Probable NDE due to electrocution.   

    2769.        Agnes M NDE       7/17/2011.      NDE 5245.       From France. Original in French, translated by Simon A.      When I separated from my body, I had a feeling of floating.  I had a feeling of total blessedness, a very intense wellbeing. I was floating in surroundings, which were very luminous and soft, rising up towards a more intense luminosity.  
   NDE from childbirth.   

    2768.        Matthieu M NDE       7/11/2011.      NDE 5220.       From France. Original in French, translated by Simon A.      I was floating in a white light, but a white, which is unknown on this Earth. In front of me, the light became more intense, drawing me towards it. I was relaxed and felt wonderfully well. I didn't want to come back at all.  
   NDE from going unconscious.   

    2767.        Michael H FDE       7/10/2011.      FDE 5278.             I was transported to a dimension of void or limitlessness where everything was very quiet and peaceful. I felt an overwhelming sense that this was indeed my death, and it did not bother me in that space one bit. Time was incredibly distorted, and for about ten minutes I watched the void, waiting for what came next. An indigo light appeared as a field surrounding me from the furthest reaches of this 'space' and I became aware that I was a luminous body, transparent and gossamer. This indigo light was very far away but surrounded me on all sides like a bubble.  
   Fear-death experience and other exceptional circumstances around experience.   

    2766.        Sue D NDE       7/10/2011.      Shared NDE 5275.       From France.      Then somebody spoke to me in a loud voice. It was my dad. He said I had to go back because my mission wasn't over yet. I fell back into my body in the bed, with a great sadness. My soul was totally sad, and I could not explain what had just happened to me. I remember getting up out of bed and wondering if I was going to die. The next morning I found out that my dad was in the intensive care unit and had had a massive heart attack. He pulled through and lived for four more years after that. He, by some uncanny transfer, enabled me to live a NDE without going through the death stuff, for particular reasons.  
   Remarkable account of an apparent NDE at the time her father had a severe heart attack.  She was not aware her father was having a heart attack, and he was a continent away from her.      

    2765.        Brandy M NDE       7/10/2011.      NDE 5272.             I began to be pulled very fast down a long, dark tunnel at the end of which was an incredibly bright light. He dragged me back to the bed and kept calling to me and I began to fight this thing that was happening to me. I knew I was dying but did not want to die; I wanted to live so that I could have children. Also, my brother had recently died and that was number two for my father; I did not want it to happen to him again.  
   NDE due to apparent inappropriately prescribed medication.   

    2764.        Joanie S NDE       7/10/2011.      NDE 5271.             I found myself in what I now think of as a previous life. I smelled smoke from a fire I was near, and saw others around me. I looked into another woman's eyes, and I knew her immediately as the woman I called my grandmother in this life. I knew then that our lives had 'danced' around each other since time began.  
   Exceptional NDEs. First NDE due to seizure during delivery. Remarkable description of past life in prehistoric time. Second NDE is shared NDE. Due to blood loss during surgery. The child she was losing at this time said that they would be back soon - and   

    2763.        Leonard S NDE       7/10/2011.      NDE 5270.             I was now on a stage or podium and the light was fully on me. The light penetrated me fully and I had never felt love like that before. Every cell in my body was full of love from the light and I began to laugh and cry simultaneously. I was crying for joy. I knew I was delivered into God's light and laughed at myself for doubting I ever would. And the love kept coming.  
   NDE due to illness.   

    2762.        Mary P NDE       7/10/2011.      NDE 5269.             Now, across from me sat a man; I could see him much more clearly than everything else. He looked Mediterranean û black hair, and the most gentle dark brown eyes I had ever seen (on Earth, at least.) When he began communicating with me, it wasn't verbal. I could hear it in my mind. He explained he came to me dressed as a modern, clean-cut human because he knew me, and (he made a bit of a joke) that if he had come in the "Robes" (his words) that I wouldn't have believed it and would have thought I had gone crazy.  Seems we started having a laughing argument over something, and I realize I was asking to stay.... I knew sitting with Christ and me.  
   NDE due to apparent cardiac event.   

    2761.        Susan C Probable NDE       7/10/2011.      Probable NDE 5268.             I was immediately aware that I was in a different place, in a room somewhere, lying all alone on a stone floor or level slab, and very, very comfortable. It didn't hurt my back to lie flat without a pillow under my knees, like I usually have to do. Anyway, I was lying on this slab, with my hands crossed over my chest like an Egyptian. All around me was dark, but I was bathed in the bright light of a spotlight. The room was the perfect temperature, and I felt no pain whatsoever. I was so comfortable, I didn't want to leave.  
   Probable NDE following surgery.   

    2760.        Harry S Probable NDE       7/10/2011.      Probable NDE 5267.             My soul or spirit made its way through mist and a tunnel. I arrived at the end, facing a solid oak door. Next to the oak door was a spirit, shadow figure who knew me really well. No words were spoken or exchanged. All communication was through mind communication between us. The oak door opened for me. I peered through. It was a beautiful place with music that sounded peaceful and blissful. I was feeling euphoric and wanted to step through.  
   Probable NDE, surgery-related (no further details available).   

    2759.        Gina J NDE       7/10/2011.      NDE 5266.             My first real memory (I say real because the clarity from the moment I was at the doorway was a clarity I've never experienced) is of feeling like it was the first time I'd ever really been alive. In my mind, I instantly knew the meaning of life and the grand plan, and I was thrilled. The plan was so perfect - something no human mind could conceive of. Everything made sense. My place in it made sense.  
   NDE due to accidental drug overdose.   

    2758.        Andrew J NDE       7/4/2011.      Shared NDE 5251.             The Lord then spoke and said, 'Your father spoke to me earlier and did not wish you to die. I granted his wish.' I conversed more with the Lord and my father. This portion isn't something I can remember, but I get the hazy sense that it was just as if we were talking things over, and that they were both consoling me. My memory picks back up at the point where I expressed my anxiety at returning to life. I think I said, 'Well, I'd like to get back down and check on Daniel.' and I gave my father and the Lord a parting hug.  
   Exceptional NDE due to accident. Shared death experience - his father had died in accident, and was with the Lord in the heavenly realm. His father had asked that the contributor not die, and the Lord granted his wish.   

    2757.        Matt H NDEs       7/4/2011.      NDE 5248.             I flashed at my friend Jason and he actually looked up at me for a brief second. I could see my flash; it was brilliant blue and lasted one second. I continued to float away. I couldn't believe what was happening, yet felt extremely well. I had to accept my death. I floated into the blue skies, then into darkness (which I thought was HELL) where I saw bad spirits circling. I prayed that I would continue floating away from them, and not stop where they were. Lucky me, I continued floating upwards, and the white light began to take over everything. I floated towards the center of the light until it completely surrounded me and there I stopped floating.  
   Two NDEs. One at age five due to playground head injury and one at age twenty-five due to blood loss.   

    2756.        Marjorie S Probable NDE       7/4/2011.      Probable NDE 5246.             I was up in the corner of the room, watching all this activity. What I can say is that I felt what I now describe as 'orgasmic' peace!!! I will never fear death because this feeling of peace was just bliss!!! I did not go anywhere or see anyone. I stayed floating in the corner of the ceiling.  
   Probable NDE at childbirth.   

    2755.        Jennifer D NDE       7/4/2011.      NDE 5265.             I remember seeing sparks of light and people at a distance in the pool but recall that they weren't wet and I had a conscious thought that I didn't understand how they could be there under the water and not be wet. I didn't seem to know any of the people I saw. It was not until sometime later that I saw family photos and was able to determine whom I saw.  
   NDE at age six. Contributor is a hospice nurse.   

    2754.  See number 2163.

          2753.        Brenda I NDEs       7/4/2011 & 2/19/2012.      NDEs 5259/6202.             I knew it was my last breath. I had such a peaceful feeling. I can only describe it as 'a peace that passes all understanding.'  Shortly after that nanosecond of darkness, I remember a light so bright, it was as if I were on a very dark stage, having a feeling that someone far greater than any human was appearing before me.  I knew I had died and my soul was telepathically communicating with God.  I remember praying, 'Dear Heavenly Father, I thought I had done something to prolong my life, but it looks as though I have done something to shorten it. Please forgive me for any sin that might be keeping me from Your presence.'  
   NDE at age 52 due to surgical complication, and NDE at age 5 due to drowning.   

    2752.        Sara V NDE       7/4/2011.      NDE 5258.             Then I remember hovering up in the corner of the room. I could see out the window, and it was raining. I could see my body on the table down where the two nurses and the doctor were, and I thought to myself, 'This is very odd!' I felt like I wanted to float out of the room. When I tried, I realized there were three entities behind me that would not let me. These entities were entirely black, and had a human shape. They spoke to me, but words did not come out of their mouths. Instead, we communicated through our minds. They told me I could not leave the room, and that they were there for my safety.  
   Probable NDE at age ten during operation for ruptured appendix.   

    2751.        Patricia P NDE       7/4/2011.      NDE 5256.       Explicit content - not for children.      While I was floating above them at about the height of a rooftop, I was shown a scene of green rolling hills off in the distance, where an ambulance was taking my body away. So I told those two persons that I wasn't finished on Earth yet. They turned towards each other and seemed to be pondering my statement.  
   NDE at age seventeen due to criminal attack.   

    2750.        Jeff Probable NDE       7/4/2011.      Probable NDE 5255.             All I remember since I was no longer experiencing amnesia, was that there was very bright light and everything was white, very bright white. Nothing else. I remember a sheet covered my whole body, head and all.  
   Probable NDE due to auto accident.   

    2749.        Karen R NDE       7/4/2011.      NDE 5254.             I remember feeling this warm, calm feeling and being in a warm light like the sun. I felt at peace and felt like there were others there watching me, but never showing themselves. I felt I was receiving a gift from somewhere. I know I didn't want to come back, because it was so peaceful there. I remember traveling to that same place all three times - but even when I came back to life, I didn't realize I had died until my mom told me later.  
   NDE due to suicide attempt with overdose of blood pressure medication.   

    2748.        Morgan A NDE       7/4/2011.      NDE 5253.             I left my body during this experience, and I found myself with my dog Tramp, who had just passed away a month before. I wouldn't be here now if it hadn't been for Tramp - that dog is the closest thing to me in the whole world. Tramp had saved my life before, and here he was, doing it again - even after he was dead.  
   NDE due to carbon monoxide poisoning.   

    2747.        Bruce NDE       7/4/2011.      NDE 5252.             All of a sudden I was traveling through a tunnel at extreme speed - so fast that I had a sickening feeling. Before I could adjust, I found myself in a very ornate light-filled room with a throne that was very high up. Once again, I had a sickening feeling, but one of a different kind. I wanted desperately to hide from the presence of God, but there was no place to go to get away from his presence. I was shown a review of my entire life, with joys, difficulties, sorrows, and everything in between.  
   NDE from unconsciousness likely due to heart attack.   

    2746.        Swas NDE       7/4/2011.      NDE 5243.       Non-western NDE      My soul flew from the space in between two of those rods. I felt like a bird. I immediately looked back and saw my pale and fragile frame, lying at the base of the window with eyes closed, saliva dripping out of the wide-open mouth and a skeletal right hand that was somehow entangled with one of the rods. I was shocked, but didn't realize I was dead. I then flew above the row of houses in that area.  I saw children playing in the park, telegraph poles, television antennas on the roof of our neighbor's houses and wet clothes hanging on the balcony. As I flew more, I began to see unfamiliar faces shouting from the streets, young men discussing a cricket match.  
   Hindu NDE at age 6 from illness.   

    2745.        Lori K NDE       7/4/2011.      NDE 5241.             I was in the presence of Jesus. We seemed to be in a wide-open space, like a beautiful field or garden behind Jesus. I could see all my dead relatives there waiting for me like my father-In-law and my Grandpa Antonio and my Aunt Lillian and my Aunt Ruby and my Aunt Frances and my Great Aunt Stannie and my Uncle Bob. I recognized many more; I knew them all by their spirit, not by their bodies. They were all happy to see me and waiting for me until I was done talking to Jesus, it seemed like they were behind an unseen boundary.  
   NDE due to being struck by car.   

    2744.        Pierre T NDE       7/3/2011.      NDE 5216.       From France. Original in French, translated to English by Jean Peter.      In my experience, I feel like pure consciousness with no body limitations and no time limit.  I feel that this part of me has always existed, even though the part of me that has been living this life hasn't consciously known about it. I also feel profoundly that the problems I've been having are nothing. Like an iceberg, the greatest part of me, (the 'underwater' part) is this newly felt consciousness.  
   NDE from going unconscious.
