forrow and in~·na~ion.
Every day I found in my route fields aban-
ooned by the plough, .villages deferted, and
cities in ruins. Frequently I met with an-
tiquemonuments; 'wrecks of temples, pa-
... }flees, and fortifications; pillars, aqueduCts,~
fepulchres.. By thefe objeCts my thoughts
were directed to paft ages, and my mind ab-
furbed"in ferious and profo~nd meditation.
, Arrived at Hamfa on the borders of the
· O.rontes, and being at no great diftance from
tl}e city of. Palmyra, fituated in the defert, I
refolved ~o examine for myfelf its boafted

The labourer, ropbed of his little capital,had
not wherewith to fow his field: taxes never-
thelefs became d~e, and he was unable to
pay them; he was threatened with corporal
punilhment, and driven to the expedient of
a loan : fpecie, for want of fecurity, was
withdrawn from circulation; the interefi of
money became enormous, and ufury aggra-
vated the mifery of the poor.

rendered the harvefis abortive, but govern-

fummated, and the country depopulated.

calls to mind the hiflory of the God of the
Chriftians; that is, the fiar of day, of which
they are both of them emblems.," .
At theic words a violent murmur arofe
~Q. ·the part of the Chrifrian groupes; but
the Mahometans, the Lamas and the Hin...
doos having called them to order, the orator
thus conduded his difcourfe.
" You are not to be told," faid he, " in
what manper the rdl of this fyll:em w~s
formed in the chaos and anarchy of the three ·
irft centuries ; how a multiplicity of opi-
nions divided the people, all of which were
embraced with equal zeal and retai:1ed,with
equal obftinacy, becaufe alike- founded on
.ancient tradition, they were alike facred.

the exclufion ofthe refr, which, on account
of their inferiority, were denominated here..
fies; how, and by what means of violence
and {eduCtion this religion was propagated
and gained frrength, and afterwards became
divided and weakened; how, fix centuries
after the innovation of Chriflianity, another
fyfrem was formed out of its materials and
thofe ofthe Jews, and a politic.al and thee..;
logical empire was created by Mahomet at
the expence of that of Mofes and the vicars
of Jefus. _
" Now, if you take a retrofpeet·of the
whole hifl:ory of the fpirit of religion, you
will find, that in its origin it had no other
author than the fenfaticns and wants of
man : that the idea of God had no other
type, no other model, than that of phyfitat
powers, material exifiences, operating good
or evil, by impreffions of pleafure or pain on
fenfible beings. You wi~l find that in the

the ignorance of the vulgar, and by the

Page id. (f). Theber with its hundred polam. The
idea ofa city with a hundred gates, in the common accep-
Jation of the word, is fo abfurd, that I am afionifued the
equivoque has not before been felt• .
I,t has ever been the cufiom of the Eall: to call palaces
and houfes of the great ·by tht! name of gates, becaufe
the principal luxury of thefe buildiiigs confifts in the
fingular gate leading from the fi-reet into the court, at the
farthe!l: extremity of which the palace is fituated. It is
under the veftibule of this gate that converfation is neld
with palfengers, and a fort of audience and hofpitality
~iven. All this was doubtlefs. know~. to Homer; but
poets make no commentaries, and readers love the mat:-
vellous.
This city of Thebes, now Lougfor, reduced to the con-
dition of a miferable village; has left aftoni1hing monu-
ments of its magnificence. Particulars of this may be feen
in the plates of Norden, in Pocock, and in the recent
travels of Bruae. Thefe Il}Onuments give credibility to '
all d1at Homer has related of its fplendour, and led us tQ
infer of its political power and external commerce.·
Its geographical pofition was favourable to this two-
fold object. For, on one fide, th~ valley of the Nile,
fingularly fertile, mufl have early occafioned anumerous
population; and, on the other, the Red Sea giving com-
munication wid~ Arabia and India, and the Nile with
Abyffinia and the Mediterranea~, . Thebes was thus na-

~jliance that procured it an aCl:ivity fo much the greater_,
as Lower Egypt, at firfl a fwamp1 was nearly, if not to--.
Jally, uninhabited. · But when at length this country had
been drained by the canals an~ ·dikes which Sefofl:ri~
~onfiruCl:ed, population was introduced there, and wars
,arofe which proved fatal to the p,owcr of Thebes. Com-
merce then took another route, and defcended to tb<;
point of the Red Sea~ to th'e canals of Sefofl:ris (Set;
Strabo) .and wealth and activity were transformed tq
Memphis. This is manifeflly what Diodorus means1
:when he tclls.us (Lib~ I. feel:. 2.) that as foon as Mem~
p.l}is was efl:abliihed and made a wholefome and ddieiou~
abode, kings abandoned Thebes tq fix ~hemfelves there,
T~us Thebes continued to decline, and Memphis t<?
flourith till the time of Alexander, who, building Alex.
andria on the border of the fea, caufed Memphis to fall
in its turn; fo that profperity and power feem to hav~
defcended hifl:orically fi:ep by flep along the Nile: whenc~
jt refults, both phyfically and hifl:orically, that the exift-
en.~e of Thebes was prior to the~.t ofthe other cities. The
tefl:imony 9fwriters is very pofitive in this refpeCl:. " The
" Thehail~,, fays Diodorus, " confider themfelves as the
" moft ancient people of the eai:th, and affert, that with

carrying on the trade was by means of veffcls with decks
of the fize of our long boats, whic;h were able to pafs the
firait and to weather the dangers of the ocean : but for
this purpofe it was neceffary to bring· ·the wood from
Mount Leban}ls and Cilicia, where it is very fine and in

Thefe veffels fpent a complete year in their voyage, that

to their being detained by the Monfoon :Currents; and
thirdly, becaufe, according to the calculat~ons .of Pliny and

This conquefi: brought Sol01non much nearer to the
tountry of gold and pearls. This alternative of a route
tither by the Red Sea or by the river Euphrates was to
the ancients, what in later times has been the alternative
in a voyage to the Indies, either by croffing the lfthrims ,
of Suez or doubling the Cape ofGood Hope. It appears ·
that till the time of Mofes this trade was carried on acrofs
the defert of Syria and Theais; that afterwards it fell
into the hands of the Phenicians, who fixed its fite upon
the Red fea, and that it was mutual jealoufr that induced
the kings of Nineveh and Babylon to undertake the de•.
firutl:ion of .Tyre and Jerufalem. I infift the more upon

difeafe of the moft fatal nature was occalioned. It follows
·from hence, 1. That all the flat country bordering upon
thefe rivers was originally a marlh; 2. That this madh
could not have been inhabited previoufiy to ~he conftruc-
tion of the banks in quefiion; 3· That thefe bankS could
not have been the work. but of a population prior as to

Egyptian ym- : ·hence his attributes taken from tlle-
tonftellation Syrius, and bis name of Anubis, as well as
that of Efculapius7 having the figure of a man an~ the
head of a dog: hence his- ferpent, which is the Hydra,
emblem of the ;Nile (Hydor, humidity); and from this
krpent be feems te have derived his name of Hermes:r. as
Rmus (with a {chin), in the ortental languages, lignifies
ferpent. Now Bedou and Hermes being the f.lme
names, it is manifeA: of what antiquity is the fyftem
afcribed to the former. As to the name of Samanean, it
is vreflifely that of Chaman preferved in Tartary, Chin~,
and India. The interpretation given to it is, man ifth1
woods, a hermit mortifying theJltjh,. fuch being the charac-
terifiic of this fe£l:; but its literal meaning is cef91iai-
(Sam!oui), and explains the fyllem of thofe who are.
t:alled by it. This fyfiem is the fame as that of the
kaaries of Orpheus, of ·the Elfenians, of the ancient
Anc:horets of Perfia and the whole Eaftem country. See
Porphyry;de Aljlin. Animal. Thefe celeftial and penitent
men, carried in India their jnfanityto fuch an extrem~, as
to wifu not to touch the earth, and they accordingly
lived in· cages fufpended to trees,. where the peopl~
whofe admiration' was not Ids abfurd, brought them
provifions. During the night there were frequent rob-
beries, rapes and murders, and it was at length dif~
covered that they were committed by thofe inen, who,.
iefcending from their cages, thus indemnified themfelves
for their refiraint during the day. The 8ramins, their
1ivals~ embraced the opportunity of exterminating them;
and from that time their name in India has been fynony-
mous with hypocrite. &c Hfll. dtla Chine, in S vols~

The ancient priefb..had three kind of fpheres, which it
may be ufeful to. make known to the reader.
, " We read in Eufebius," fays Porphyry, " that Zo-
roafter was the fira who, having fixed upon a cavem
pleafantly fituated in the mountains adjacent to Perfia,
fOrmed the idea of confecrating it to Mithra (the fun)
creator and father of all things : that is to fay, having·
made in this caver.n fever.tl geometrical divifions, repre-
fenting the feflfons and the dements, he imitated on a
fmall fcale the order and difpofition of the univerfe bY' ·
Mithra. After Zoroafier, it bec~me a cullom to confe-
crate caverns for the celebration of myfteries: tO that in·
like manner as temples were ·dedicated to -the Gods,:
~ural altars tv heroes'and·terreftrial deities,&::. fubterra-
neous abodes to infernal deities, fo caverns and grottoea
were confecrated•to the world, to the uuiverfe, and to the
nymphs: and from bene~ Pythagor!lS and Plato borrowed
the idea of ·calling the earth a cayern, a cave, dt Antr•
Nympharum."
Such was the firft projecHon of. the fphere in relief:
though the Pcrlians give the honour of the invention to
Zoroafier, it is doubtlefs due to the Egyptians: for
we may fuppofe, from this projection being the moft
fimple, that it was the .moft ancient; the caverns of
Thebes, full of fimilar pitl:ores, tend to ftrengthen this·
opinion.
The following was the fecond projection, " The pro~
pbets or hieropbants," fays Bifhop Synnefius, " who had
been initiated in the mylleries, do not permit the com--
mon workmen to form idols or images of the Gods; but·

and natural tbinge, and wifh for prodigies and fables." .
($p. ;, Ca/flit.) That is, the ancient pridls baal armil-
Iary fpb.eres like ours; and this pa4fage, which fo wen
agrees with that of Cberemon, gives us the key to all
their theological aLlroJogy.
Laftly, they had jlat mDMis of tbe nature of Plate II.
with thia difference, that they were.of a very complicated
•ure, bav~g every fiaitious divifwn of decan 'and ilb-
~ with the hieroglyphic. ftgns of their influence.
Kircher bas giYCn us a copy of one of them in his Egyp-
tian <Edipus, and Gybelin a figured fragment in ·his
!look of the calendar (under the name· of..the Egyptian
Zodiac). The.aocient Egyptians, fays the aftrOloger
Julius Firmicus (4Jimr.lib. ii. and lib. iv. c. 16). divide
each ftgn of the Z~iac into three fetl:ions; and each
xetion was under the direaion of an imaginary being,
whom they called Dtcan, or chiif of tm ; fo that there
were three De<:ans a month; and -thirty-three a1 year.
Now thefe Decaos, who were alfo called Gods (Thoi),
regul-.te the deftinies of mankind-and they were placed
particularly in c~rtain ftars. They afterwards imagined
in every tnt three other Gods, whom they called llrllitws;
. fO that there were nine .for every month, and. theM: were
&rther divided into an infinite number ofpowers. (Tile
Perfians and Indians made their fpberes on fimilar plans ;
and if a piaure thereof were to be drawn from ~e de-
Ccription given by Scaligcr.at the ·end of Manw.a$, we
Aould fil)d in it a complete explanation of. their hierogly-
phics, for. cv~y article forms one).

}hade. There is on this fubjeB: a paffage in Plutarch, fo
interefling and explanatory of the.whole of this fyftem,
that we 1hall cite it entire. Ha1•ing obferved that dle
theor.y of good and .evil had at all times occupied the·atten-
~ion of philofophers and theologians, he adds : " Many
fuppofe there to be two Gods of oppolite inclinations, onct
delighti11g iri good the other in evil ; the firfl of thefe ia
called particularly by. the name of God, the fecond by that
of. Genius or Demon. Zoroafter has denominated them
Oromaze and Ahrimanes, and has faid that, of whatever
falls under the cognizance of our fenfes, light is the heft:
reprefentation of the one, and darknefs and ignorance of
the other. He adds, that Mithra is an intermediate be..
ing, and it is for this reafon the Perfians call Mithra the
mediator or intermediator. Each of thefe wods has diftinct
plants and anim~s confecrated to him; for example, dogs,
birdsand hedge-hogs belong to the good Geni~s, and all
aquatic animals to the evil one. .
"The Perfians alfo fay, that Oromaze was born or
.formed out ofthe purefllight; Ahrimanes, on the contrary,
out of the thickefl darknefs: that Oromaze made fix Gods
as good as himfelf, and Ahrimanes oppofed to them fix
wicked ones: that Oromaze afterwards multiplied himfelf
.ru-eefold (Hermes trifmegi!l:us), and removed to a ciiflancc
as remote from t~e fun as the fun is remote from the earth;
d'lat he_there formed flars, and, among others, Syrius,
which be placed in the heavens as a guard and centineJ.
He made alfo twenty-four other Gods, which he indofecl
in an egg 1 but Ahrimanes created an eqt.Jal number on his
par; who broke the egg,-and fro?l that moment good ancl
evil were mixed (in the univerfe). B~ Ahrimanes ia

one day to be conquered, and the earth to be mad~ -~qual
andJmcoth, that all men may live; happy.
Theopompus adds, from- the boob oftbe Magi, t\lat
one of thefe Gods reigns in turn every three tbouf.md
years, during which the other is kept in fubjeB:ion ; that
they afterwards contend with equal weaponsduring.a fimi-
lar portion of time, but that in the end the evil Genius
will f.a11 (never to rife again). Then menwill become hap-
py, and their bodies caft no ~e. The God who mediates .
all thefe things reclines at prefent in repofe, waiting till he
fuall b"e pleafed to ex~ute them." See l.fts and Ofiris.
There is an apparent allegory through the whole of this
palfage. The egg is the i)xed fphere, the world ; the fuc
Gods of Oromaze are the fuc figns of fummer, thofe of
·Ahrimanes the fuc figns of winter. The forty-eight other
Gods are the forty-eight conllellations ofthe ancientfl'here,
divided equally between Ahrimanes and.Oromaze• .The
office of Syrius, as guard and Centinel, tells us that the
origin of thefe ideas was Egyptian : finally, the expreffion
that the earth is to become ~qual and fi;rzqoth, and that the
bodies of happf beings are to caft no lhade, proves that
the .equator was confidered as their true paradife.

other words, the principle of life, the mover .of._

Jupiter? Let us hear the Greeks and Latins explain their
.theology. " The Egyptians," fays Diodorus, aft~r Ma~
natho, priefl of Memphis," in giving names to the five
elements, calledfpirit, or ether, u'upiter, on account of
the true meaning of that word: for Jpirit is the fource of
life, author of the vital principle in animals ; and for this
reafon they confidered him as the father, the generator Q{
beings." For the fame reafo~ Homer fays, father, an4
king of men and gods (Diod.lib. I.je!f. I.)
" Theologians," fays Macrobius, " confider You-piteJ;
as the foul of the world." ~ence the words of Virgil :
" Mufcs let us begin with You-piter; the world is full
ofYou.piter" (Somn. Scip. ch. ·I7.) And in the Satur-

the horizon at the very moment that Perfeus rifes; and .
the ferpents which furround it are Ophiucus and the
Polar Dragon, who then occupy the zenith. This thews
us in what manner the ancients compofed all their figures
and fables. They took fuch confiellatiqns as they found
at the fame tittle on the circle of the horizon, and col-
lecting the different parts, they formed groupes which
ferved them as an alma1iac in hieroglyphic characters.
Such is the fecret of all their pictures, and the folution
of all their mythological monfters. The Virgin is alfo
Andromeda, delivered by Perfeus from the whale that
puifues her (pro-j·quitur.)

found in the name lou-feph (Jofeph). At no great dif- :-
tance is the afs of Typhon (the great the-bear), and the
ox or bull, the ancient attendants of the manger. Peter
the porter, is Janus will\ his keys and b:lld forehead: the
twelve apofiles are the genii of the twelve months, &c.
This Virgin has aCted very different parts in the variou:>
fyftems of mythology: lhe has been the IGs of the Egyp·
tians, who faid of her in one of their infcriptions cited ·
by Julian, thefi"uit I have broughtforth is thefun. The
majority of traits drawn by Plutarch apply to her, in the
fame manner as thofc of Ofiris apply to Bootes : alfo the
feven principal ftars <'fthe the-bear, called David'schariot,
were called the chariot .of Ofiris (See Kirker) ; and the
crown that is fituated behind, formed of ivy1 was called
Chen -Ofiris, the tree of Ofiris• . T~~ Virgin has likewife
been Ceres, whofe myfteries were the fame with thofe of
Ifis and Mithra; lhe has been the Diana of the Ephe-
(~ans; the great goddefs of Syria, Cybele, drawn by lions;-
Minerva, the mother of Bacchu~; Alhza, a chafte vir-
gin taken up into heaven at the end of the golden age;
Thems, at whofe feet is the balance that was put in her
hands; the Sybil of Virgil, who defcends into 'hell, or
finks .below the hemifphere with a branch in her. hand,
