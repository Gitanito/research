INTRODUCTION
The history of this book is in itself an interesting and
amusing narrative. After the publication of The Un
obstructed Universe, Betty informed us that some time
must elapse before she would be ready to give another
"divulgence." So it occurred to me to examine once
again the records of the work Betty did while she was
still here. Twice already they had been combed for
material — the extracts used in making The Betty Book
and Across the Unknown. While those two books
dealt to a large degree with Betty's training, the effort
had been to select material from a viewpoint of univer
sal application. Now another viewpoint might prove
valuable — that of Betty's own education irrespective
of any concern with others than herself.
Perhaps it was largely for my own satisfaction; in
any case I did again go through the roughly million and
a quarter words that were the records of Betty's work
while here. Passages directed at her personally, and no
one else, I red-pencilled. Next I cut them out and
pasted them seriatim. They totalled nearly two hun
dred thousand words. For the first time I read them
consecutively; and realized that, even with no further
arrangement, I had a narrative. Furthermore, it had
growth-interest, it moved, it climaxed — most glori
ously, I thought. Here was obviously a book to be

written. Therefore, as I am a writer of books, I set
blithely about it.
No light job, I realized. I must tell the story as clearly
and simply as possible; I must be accurate, for this sort
of thing depends on its integrity; I must use, of those
two hundred thousand words, only about one-fifth,
lest the reader be confused as well as bored by the rep-
itition necessary for the perfection of Betty's instruc
tion.
My first attempt was to follow chronology and to
quote from the records verbatim such excerpts as
would best illustrate each step of Betty's progress; with,
of course, the necessary editorial connective tissue.
That did not work at all. Betty's instruction was indeed
from simple to complex. But definitely it was not
chronological. Her orderly graduation from grade to
grade was an illusion. My re-perusal of the record made
clear to me that actually, in essence, she was given the
whole thing at once. I can go back now and perceive
that the whole plan and the whole accomplishment is
laid out in the first hundred or so pages. In other words,
Betty was exposed to the entire experience and instruc
tion much as a photographic film is exposed
— sharply
to the dot of the opening and closing of the shutter.
But, just as the image resulting is latent and must be
developed out, so was Betty's comprehension and con
trol latent, and it too must be developed out. Her train
ing was just that.

INTRODUCTION 9
When once I had got that through my head, the rea-
son#for a number of things became clear to me. As, foi
instance, the Invisibles' maddening habit of abandon
ing one subject for another, and yet another; return
ing to each, apparently at random, and certainly at odd
times. Now I was able to see that what my logical mind
had wanted to be a building process, one brick on an
other, was in fact the aforesaid developing-out, the
whole image becoming more and more defined only
as the development proceeded. Whatever might be the
illusion of a step-by-step-graded-school; I now saw,
as I struggled to work out a chronological presentation
of the material, it came about because the Invisibles had
successively brought to major prominence, one after
the other, single details of the whole image, subduing
temporarily all the rest. But never was a detail so clari
fied as to obviate their need for back-tracking. They
were inveterate moppers-up.
Realization that chronology offered no satisfactory
frame for this story cleared my mind for a re-write. To
do this re-write I had to use a card-index system and
from it take all that had been said on any particular phase,
whenever and wherever, and then piece it together in
to a cohering pattern. I had already found that method
necessary in making The Betty Book, but as the latter
dealt only with beginnings, and as this book dealt with
the whole picture, I assumed it to be outmoded. So I
did it in that sequence. For example, in dealing with

some fundamental concept, such as Contact with the
Source, I might find it made prominent from, say, about
page 1 200 to about 1 300, but already on page 4 some
thing had been said so apposite that it must be fitted
into the later, more extended discussion
And that did not work either. If I quoted a passage
entire, it was too long. Worse yet, the new sequence
could not be made to behave any more than had the
chronological method, because
it,
too, skipped about.
My brother Harwood did grand work in searching
records, correlating them, showing their connection.
I
did
a
lot of writing. At last we produced something —
not the right something. None the less we agreed to be
satisfied. And then, as
I
was ready to pass the manu
script on to the publishers, Betty herself, through Joan,
of The Unobstructed Universe, turned
it
down flat.
It
must be done over again.
"You have," said Betty, reinforced by her coadju
tors—I here adopt their own bold habit of putting
a
con
densation, though an accurate one, in quotes — "col
lected an admirable lot of building blocks. Good build
ing blocks. Your trouble
is
that you are trying to use
them undressed for the job, and even yet you are in
fluenced by the chronological order of their delivery."
Now
I
will begin to quote the Invisibles verbatim.

years, over and over again in the same things, with enor
mous elaboration in her instruction. Of course there

were many repeats, and in many places. You cannot
take your readers in three hours over the whole of those
twenty years. Your job is a selective job. You have the
obligation to dip into any portion for clarity. You must
pick out the bits that seem the sharpest illustration of
Betty's systematic travel of the Road — no matter
where they come. The public has to have a straight
line. It just canH be expected to jump over twenty
years!"
That helped.
"Furthermore," the Invisibles pointed out, "you are
not now writing a didactic book, like The Betty Book
and Across the Unknown. This is a drama, and must be
written as such; with three Acts. Act I: How Betty
was taught to tap the Source. Act II: Her actual experi
ence after she had learned to do so. Act III: What she
did with
it,
and what
it
did to her. Only don't present
the narrative as three Acts or three Parts; obliterate the
joints.
"Now," they further instructed, "use what you have
already written as building blocks. Distribute them in
three piles, as they fall under one or the other of the
three Acts. Then go ahead. And slash out all but the
best that applies."
This was the scheme of my final rewrite.

had this
advantage:
I
was in weekly touch through Joan, and so
could submit my results. Betty and her Invisibles did

ferring, changing phraseology. So sometimes there
may be found a slight variance in my quotation and
the original record, or a difference in sequence. And
of course it has been necessary for the sake of both
clarity and ease to condense as of one continuous ses
sion the material scattered over several.
But Betty was right in her insistence on the dramatic
form. The actual process of her development is in no
sense altered by
it;
rather
it
becomes clearer, and more
easily to be followed.
So this book, like the others,
is
a
collaboration. My

Invisibles through Joan for personal supervision and

CHAPTER I

i.
I must write this book for three reasons: First, to satis
fy numerous readers of The Unobstructed Universe —
the third of the so-called "Betty books" and dictated
by her through another psychic after her death — who
demand insistently to know "how Betty got that way";
second, to answer questions from the many who, in one
way or another, are setting out on the path Betty fol
lowed; third, because in her own training Betty was
given a pattern for living which could well be used by
all of us.
For one by-product of The Betty Book, and Across
the Unknown, written before Betty's death, as well as
The Unobstructed Universe, published just eighteen
months after she died, is a widespread interest in Betty
herself. This is more than a mere curiosity as to per
sonality. The latter is well enough defined by what
these books report of her words and thoughts. Rather,
people want to know — to judge by their letters — how
that personality came about. How much was her orig
inal self? How much was of her own volitional devel
opment? How much was due to her training by the In

visibles?f What was that training? As applied to her,
alone, or to be aspired to by others? For of course a
good deal of the teachings in the three books is an ac
count of training methods for mankind in general. In
a word what hundreds of my correspondents say they
want is a biography of Betty.
But not a biography in ordinary definition. Rather
a biography of inner life and development. What made
her what her three books show her to be? After all,
that is the essential aim of any biography — to evaluate
the expansion of a person's life, and to examine the in
fluences and happenings and accomplishments that
brought this person to wherever he or she had landed
by that pausing-time we call death.
2.
As with most lives that grow to an ultimate fullness,
material in Betty's case is embarrassingly abundant.
The difficulty is not of search, but of selection and ar
rangement. The whole record of the work Betty did
in the higher consciousness, both while she was still
here and after her death, runs to two thousand four
hundred single-spaced pages. From the two thousand
done in her lifetime I have clipped those passages that
carried individual instruction. These make over three

hundred pages — all material from which to select. Be
sides, there are, of course, my own recollections of
nearly forty years. And in addition, more than a year
after her death, I came upon a filing folder containing
a miscellany of papers in which from time to time she
herself had set down jottings of her own attitude
toward the work she was doing, and the impression she
had of it.
So, in order to make a start, it is necessary to adopt
a point of view. It must be this: that here is an account
of one person's psychic training for a specific job of
what later, after her death, she was to call "divulgence."
It is quite aside from the purposes
— and also the possi
bilities — to do a portrait or a "character sketch" of
Betty. She was as many sided as she was femininely
elusive. When I think of attempting
it,
I
share her own
impatience with words.
"It's like trying to look at the stars in the daytime,"
she once complained. "It's perfectly clear until
I
bring
it
into the daylight of words, and then it's gone.
I
don't
want to be silly; but the words make one laugh: they arc
so long-drawn-out for the amount of idea in them.
It
is
as impossible to put my world2 into words as
it
is
to put
the ocean in
a
bucket." Again and again
I
remember
her interrupting her reporting to express that despair
over the impossibility of containing such things in

language. Nearing the end of her long experience she
wrote this, in her own person, one of the fragments I
found in her files.
"Seeing the thing makes it too big for words; they
stumble. A condensation of words is a flat crystallized
process. Reality is a rounded thing, that pulses. It over
flows the mold of words. I cannot tell what my words
are doing. I can only radiate myself. That is my form
of expression. Take it from me as I pass: it is yours."
This gives me a glimpse for my point of view. Betty
did radiate herself. For example, many people, seeing
her objectively, remarked oh how naturally and with
out effort she assumed the age of her companions of
the moment. She could join children or old people
—
or anybody between — and become for the time being
actually one of them. And obviously this was by no
taking thought of condescension or adjustment. She
entered their world so interestedly and wholly that she
blended with it.
A friend had two children aged six and four. In due
time the mother presented them with a baby sister; and
the happy idea occurred to her that Peter and Sally
could pick out the infant's godmother. They consulted.
"Can we have anyone we want? Anyone at all?"
they asked.
"Anyone," the mother assured them, wondering
which of a very large family of aunts and cousins it
would be.

THE ROAD I KNOW 10
"Then we'll take Betty White," said they.
Partly because of this faculty, people flocked to
Betty with their problems and troubles. She gave them
tea — and radiated; and sympathized with them in her
•way, which was not at all a coddling way, but as brac
ing as a frosty morning. She seemed almost to avoid
feeding them specific advice; and they went away a
little puzzled over why they felt so much better about
things. Not that she had no specific advice, when it
was really appropriate. Nor that she lacked the moral
courage to speak out in meeting when — rarely — an
almost brutal bluntness would really do some good.
Three days after she had died a man took me aside.
"I want to tell you something," said he. "Do you
remember, a number of years ago, how intolerant I was
of people? About little things, I mean?"
"I certainly do," I agreed.
"And perhaps you noticed that all at once I quit?"
"I certainly did," said I. "Everybody did."
"Well, one evening, after I'd been holding forth
about so-and-so's lipstick, and what's-her-name's
swank and a lot of my usual guff, Betty took me off in
a corner. 'See here, Jim!

said she — and I'll never for

— 'you are just about
the poorest sportsman I know.'

fully. "That put me back on my heels," said he.

"I swallowed hard and asked her what she meant,"
continued Jim.
"
'I'll tell you,' said she. 'You like to put
people into classifications, and then you get mad at
them when they do the perfectly natural things that
prove you were right!

"That," said Jim, "opened my eyes. Do you know,"
he went on somewhat hesitatingly, "there had always
been a word that somehow I had never found the mean

people used
it,
and all that, of course; but what
I
mean
is

he floundered.

I.

"Yeah. And then

"What was the word?"
I
asked.

watching Betty with the playwright's look of specula
tion and analysis, and finally giving
it

"That damned charm!" he muttered, shaking his
head.
For Betty's outer person was just that. Charm —
charm and gaiety. And a delightful wit, that was wit
because of new angles of view, and of modes of expres
sion so original and unexpected that the stiffest for
malist must yield to it. I suppose it carried so far because
it was in no way artificial, or considered, or thought
over. It was Betty's normal language, the way she
thought, and therefore the way she spoke. Like all wit
of that kind, while unforgettable, it is equally unquot
able. In report most of it becomes mere museum mount
ings without the breath of life. But no one was ever
bored with Betty. Even though what she had to say
might be drily statistical, one found himself alert for
what she would make of it. I lived with her thirty-five
years, and — though there was plenty more — in all that
time I was always relishingly entertained, and contin
ually anticipating what next.
However, it was not the outer expression but the in
ner person that made the charm memorable; made it
stick, as it were. Apparently people never forgot Betty.
She made an indelible impress. After her death I re
ceived several hundred letters — and I mean letters
pages long, not mere "notes of condolence." An extra
ordinary number of them were from people who had
met her just once and years before — from twelve to
to thirty-two years before — but who wrote as though

her personality were to them as of yesterday. On my
return home, after her death in Upland in 1939, my
secretary told me that a very aged Negro had hobbled
in to say how sorry he was. "Mis' White, she was
folks" said he. Investigating, I found that this man had
given the windows of our new house their first wash
ing when the builders had cleared out, and that was all
the contact he had ever had with us. The house was fin
ished in 1

Now I am not setting down these things as a partisan
of Betty. I am her partisan of course; but my point is
that so became and so remained everyone who had
even casual contact with her. And, I am convinced, this
has been true, not essentially because of the outer char
acteristics, but because of what she called "radiation."
This power of radiation probably was inborn; the train
ing of her Invisibles was directed toward its conscious
unfoldment. I say it must have been inborn, for obvi
ously there must have been something to work on,
something to develop. So, though this biography is of
the inner, it must be built on a foundation of outer cir
cumstance, and we must deal briefly with the latter.
Betty was a little woman. She always firmly main
tained that five feet was her "official height." For thirty

lars — for herself or her pet charity — if measurement
would prove that claim; and a further offer of one
hundred dollars if she would be measured at all! These
offers she always refused with dignity. Nevertheless
her proportions were so harmonious, and she carried
herself with so spirited a lift of the head that her tiny
stature had its own unique personality. People called
her "exquisite"; I suppose that was the adjective most
often used to describe her. Also she seemed to have the
secret of perpetual youth. Until her last illness at fifty-
nine, her figure was as slender and well-formed; her
hair as soft and abundant and brown — she never had a
gray hair; her skin as smooth; her cheeks as shell pink
as at twenty-five. This is not my own — and fatuous —
opinion, but the occasion for wondering remark by so
many of her friends that I have to believe it factually
true.
"Why!
" exclaimed a visitor, seeing her in bed with
her hair about her on the pillow, "she's just like a little
girl!"
The statement of all this would have slight impor
tance, were it not for the possibility — worth consider
ing — that this too may well be the "outward and visible
sign" of that inner thing she called radiation — her de
velopment of which we are to deal with in this book.

tive endurance. Before my marriage I had led a rather
unusually venturesome life, in all parts of the world,
and this I continued afterward. And Betty went along.
Horse and pack in the Sierra and Rockies; the cattle
roundups of Arizona; afoot and back-packing in the
trailless back country; canoe travel; fourteen months
of safari in Central Africa; years of cruising along the
Pacific Northwest coast. Nor was she taken along as a
considered and pampered sightseer. Naturally I eased
things for her when I could, but often it was not possi
ble to ease things at all. These were no play trips. The
mountain travel was before the days of made trails and
guides: we carried everything we needed — even to
horseshoes — on horseback, for five months at a time;
we slept without cots or tents; and sometimes rode
fourteen hours of a day, and then cooked and made
camp. Arizona of those days had no dude ranches: Bet
ty slept on the ground, and arose at four to a real
cow-puncher breakfast of thin, greasy fried-steak and
soggy soda biscuits, and saw no more food until night
fall; and in the hours between rode the breakneck lava
doing her full share in the cattle drive. On foot trips in
the woods she carried her own appropriate back-pack.
The safari of her day in Africa was no modern Cook's
tour of prearrangement: we took our bearers from the
savage tribes. As for Alaska — well, one day she went
out on a shore excursion with Charley, who is six feet
one and weighs a hard hundred and eighty pounds.

Charley promised to take good care of her. On their

Her steady coolness and courage were probably also
manifestations of an inner quality. In strenuous out
door life there must be emergencies. She met them. If
the nature of the show was one — a lion muss-up for
instance — to which she could not contribute, she was
behind the guns, where she belonged, and keeping
quiet. When there was something she could do, she did
it,
calmly and efficiently. Sometimes that something
took coolheadedness, sometimes real courage. Once in

lay immobile the eternity before I could get hold of a
rifle. Of a wild and stormy day that kept me close to
an ailing and uncertain engine of the little cruiser she
and I conducted for some years up the British Columbia
coast, a violent sea threw her against the spokes of the
wheel where she stood at her post, breaking two of her
ribs. I did not know this until we reached a port, three
days later.
"Why should I tell you?" she answered my re
proach. "There was nothing to be done about it."
Suffering — of others — tore her heart; but she could
cut steadily and coolly into human flesh, when a back-
wood's accident made minor surgery necessary. I've
seen her cut a deeply imbedded fishhook from a man's
arm with entire coolness and dexterity, a lot calmer
than the man himself — until afterward! Then she
wailed.
A curious and interesting angle to this is that she
came to it not only without preparatory training or
experience, but with what ordinarily would be called
a handicap. She was raised in Newport, with subse
quent backgrounds of fashionable hotels in Bermuda,
Florida, Jamaica, California. From babyhood to the
very noon I married her she was tagged about by a
personal Negro "mammy," who dressed and undressed
her, and picked up things after her. Her education was
in an "exclusive" girls' school, where, she later con
fessed, she learned "the whole of nothing."

So, for a honeymoon, I took her into the Sierra
where she slept on the ground and no tent; ate camp
food of my cooking; and got along by way of ward
robe — for four months — on what she could stuff into
one small duffle bag. This seemed to me then a nice
easy trip! I had been up in the Hudson Bay region, car
rying everything I owned on my back; and here we had
horses to do the carrying, and I did the cooking and
hard work, and all Betty had to do was sit a horse and
look at the scenery — and — oh, yes — make the bed and
help pack and do the laundry and maybe wash dishes
occasionally when the horses strayed! Taking a lot for
granted in the beginning, only years later did I realize
that I was favored with a very miracle of adaptability.
For Betty had a good time always; a joyous, zestful,
outflinging good time. She always had that, right
through life. For her the world was, indeed, full of a
number of things. She scorned the thought that it could
ever be otherwise. "Old age?" she answered someone's
pessimistic objection. "But why old age at all? Old age
is when you stop looking at things!

Sometimes, to tease her, I would describe her as the
world's greatest mongrel, and to prove it I would gab
ble, almost in a breath, as it were, the catalogue of her
mixture.

One gift, that she had always possessed, was greatly
developed, or perhaps only more clearly disclosed, by
the life she led with me. That was her kinship with ani
mals as well as with human beings. She understood
them, and — more important — they understood and
had confidence in her. Often I have rounded the bend
of an Alaskan river to see Betty, sitting on a cut bank,
talking to a raven beside her. On my appearance the
bird would at once fly away — though I was, perhaps,
a hundred yards distant, and Betty but two or three
feet. We were having a good deal to do, at that time,
with the big Alaska brown — sometimes called Kadiak
— bear, and as we were taking moving pictures and not
killing, the camera demanded much shorter range than
the rifle. While these animals by no means deserve their
reputation for ferocity, they are to be treated with
respect. One day Betty, walking upstream, met one of
them, somewhere between twelve and fifteen hundred
pounds of live bear, walking down stream. She stopped,
drew herself up to her full five feet (?), and pointed a
commanding finger.

CHAPTER II
EVERYBODY IS PSYCHIC
/.
There may have been, in the world's history, others
who have been as rigorously and systematically trained
as was Betty for her especial job of divulgence. If so
the details of their training, if recorded, have not come
to my attention. The capacity for mediumship is be
yond question a natural gift. But, like any other natural
gift, it is of itself imperfect, unreliable in detail. Above
all, without intelligent cultivation, it does not progress.
Used prematurely or excessively it often appears to de
teriorate, perhaps finally to atrophy to nothing. There
is close analogy to a natural singing voice that is used
too soon or too much. No reasonable teacher allows
that. He wants reliability, stability, and progress.
Now Betty had this natural gift of mediumship to
a high degree. But until 1
9 1

I — recognized it technically. Her friends knew her as
one with exquisitely delicate human sympathies and re
lationships, extraordinarily sensitive and responsive to
the deeper beauties of life, and possessed of almost un
canny intuitions. Then occurred the small "chance"
experience which presently she herself will describe.

34 THE ROAD I KNOW
She found herself unexpectedly in what is called "psy
chic" touch with an unseen world.
This
is,
of course, no very unusual occurrence. In
deed, since
I
came out openly on the whole subject, I've
had so many people write me and recount their own
experiences, that
I
am almost tempted to say
it
is
a
rather
common occurrence! But most such persons run
a
standardized course.
As
it
ordinarily goes, the psychic gets in touch, by
one technique or another, with what seems indubitably
to be discarnate intelligences. These latter give "com
munications." Sometimes these communications are
convincing enough to withstand skilled and dispassion
ate appraisal of genuineness; though even then, more
often than not, they show
a
strong dash of "coloring"
from the medium's subconscious. Both the new-fledged
medium and the sitters are enormously impressed.
They feel that to them
is
being confided a message of
sacred trust. The world must be told of it! Indeed, not
infrequently they feel they have been especially
in
structed to go forth and proclaim. The psychic has
said — and the statement has been accepted at face val
ue — "you are chosen" to give forth
a
revelation. Na
turally this sense of almost sacred obligation results in
a
book or pamphlet, generally privately printed, dis
tributed in all good faith, and with all confidence that
it
is
going to arouse said world. Its failure to do so
is
a
most disheartening and disillusioning puzzle.

It should not be. There are really only two things
wrong in the experience, though nine-tenths — per
haps even a larger percentage — of the effort is true and
constructive.
One of the two things is the assumption that the
"message" is intended for the world. That is natural
enough. Indeed, haven't they been so told? It is flatter
ing to be especially "chosen," and what reason, as yet,
is there to doubt? But I am sorry to say that long and
varied experience has made me leery of just that state
ment. It occurs too often. I am convinced it indicates
either that the whole occurrence is phony, or that the
medium's subconscious is at work. Not that the medi
um is really at fault, or exhibiting undue egotism. The
material given is indeed important, if only a recasting
of proverbial wisdom; and that importance exagger
ates itself in the medium's subconscious. The "mes
sage" is real, but it is not addressed to the world; it is
addressed to just those few people of that small group,
fitting their need for the couching of old truths in lan
guage appropriate to their understanding; and is meant
only for their own development and unfoldment. They
are getting personal attention. It fits them. Also many
others in the world are getting personal attention. Very
rarely, and only in emergency of world need, is the
divulgence intentionally conveyed in such form as to
merit widespread acceptance.

Seven Purposes, Lodge's Raymond, in spite of all its ob
vious "coloring," and the anonymous Our Unseen
Guest commanded a public. An emergency existed.
In Betty's case there seemed to be no such urgency.
Quite the contrary, indeed. Nor were we told that we
were especially selected, except for our own sakes.
And it was nearly eighteen years before we were al
lowed to think the job was in any way public.
The Betty Book did not come out until 1937, and
that, I think, was conceded rather to satisfy our own
uneasiness over the enormous accumulation of record,
than because of any desire on the part of the Invisibles.
Before that they had appeased our instinct for order by
helping us put together an arrangement of the teaching
comprised in the first four hundred pages of records,
covering the first year and a half. This was duplicated
in fifteen or twenty mimeographed copies, and had a
wide lending circulation among personal friends and
acquaintances. It was the basis on which — in 1935
—
some fifteen years later — we began to build The Betty
Book. By that time the records had grown to 1993
pages. Nevertheless, we were held, in The Betty Book,
to the material of that first year and a half — approxi
mately those first 400 pages. Only a primer was called
for, said the Invisibles, hinting — but vaguely — that
the more advanced work would be collated and dealt
with later. The "primer" was not actually published
until 1937.

Encouraged by its reception, my brother and I
plunged into selecting from the now bewilderingly
abundant material, and emerged with the compilation
we called A cross the Unknown. This dealt with Betty's
later experiences. It by no means exhausted the rec
ords, but we had more or less caught up to Betty, so
to speak, and now we could go on with her in what
ever were to be her further explorations. That looked
like the job; and a good job it was.
Therefore when Betty fell so desperately ill, in 1
93 8,
we had every confidence in her recovery. She had been
rigorously and carefully trained for twenty years, and
seemed to us just to have arrived at the point of her
real effectiveness as a tool: surely that tool must be
put to use! It did not make sense otherwise. Neverthe
less when she did die, we had no feeling of frustration.
The very circumstance of her death appeared to point
the climax of truth to the whole episode of her long
training. I wrote of that in the final chapter to Across
the Unknown. I have quoted from it once before in
The Unobstructed Universe. Nevertheless, here, for
the third time, it appears in print as necessary back
ground to the whole picture.
"You know," I wrote of my experience immediately
following her death \ "the cozy, intimate feeling of

two of empty solitude to make us realize how substan

"Well, within a very few minutes that companion
ship flooded through my whole being from Betty, but
in an intensity and purity of which I had previously had
no conception. It was the same thing, but a hundred, a

than compensated for the little fact that she had stepped
across, because it was the thing that all our physical

2.
So we imagined the job finished — except perhaps in
the further use of material from the records. Then oc
curred my visit to renew friendship with Darby and
Joan, of Our Unseen Guest, and through Joan came
Betty's "divulgence" of that amazing book, The Un
obstructed Universe. Soon it was blazingly clear that
without Betty's twenty years of training here in our
obstructed universe such a "divulgence" would have
been totally impossible from her present unobstructed
phase of living there: that it would be equally impossi
ble for her to have given it from here; that — obscurely
to us at first, but evident to us now — all along she and
Joan had been developing apart as a team now to work
together. That the job had just begun! As an end of
effort the previous two books fell into relative unim

while. "But," said she, "they should really be read
after this one."
Curiously, as it seemed to us at the time, she had
never taken much part nor great interest in the writing
of the first two books, either on her own, or when she
was working in her "other consciousness" with the In
visibles. "These books," she told us — from that other
consciousness — "are not intended to reach many peo
ple—yet."
But of the third book, from the very start, she, now
a permanent dweller in the other consciousness, con- -
fidently predicted, "this is going to make a stir"; "this
is going to be taken up by the scientists." We flatly dis
believed her. Fully as we recognized the novelty and
value of the book's contents, we considered it limited
in appeal to the small and very specialized public al
ready interested in such things. We were wrong. It
sold twelve printings in its first three and a half months;
it elicited literally hundreds of letters; it has been
preached on from many pulpits. And, as for the scien
tists, I have dozens of letters, from all varieties of them,
some of each sort professing to find in the book revo
lutionary principles that open to them new fields in
their own specialties.
In view of this, and in view of the fact that Betty
promises us further "divulgence" in due time, an ac
count of her twenty years of rigorous preparation,
seems now to be strongly indicated.

CHAPTER III
BETTY'S OWN NARRATIVE
i.
A few months ago, and quite by chance, I came across
a number of folders in which Betty had filed a mass of
papers and notes. Among them were sheets on which
she had written down — apparently at irregular inter
vals — her own personal impressions concerning all
this long arduous discipline and unfoldment. They are
fragmentary and undated. I think perhaps they were
notes for a personal narrative which was never under
taken. They do, however, give an invaluable back
ground for the account of her training drawn from
the actual records. The following — as far as it goes —
is what Betty herself, in her own normal person, wrote
of her thoughts and impressions concerning her experi
ence. It is as she wrote
it,
except that

sooner or later, with some one who has had experiences
of a startling nature, something that points to the exis
tence of powers beyond those we ordinarily possess.
If such an experience happens to us personally, it is all
the more arresting because we are forced to believe in
it and try to explain it. Few things that can happen to
us in the course of life are as thrilling — in the true sense
of the word — as staggering, as these glimpses of an ex
tension of our powers. Something long buried in us
seems to come to the surface temporarily and convince
us that the thing experienced is quite possible and true.
I say temporarily, because at first it has tremendous
tides. The high tide of our first enthusiasm has an ebb
that drains away everything, leaving us far away from
the original flooding inspiration. Then everything goes
cold, flat and hopelessly inaccessible, if not actually
repellent.
"It seems that the development of these higher pow
ers within us runs a definite course, with symptoms
almost as recognizable as measles. Exaltation and secur
ity; then flat-tired incapacities of all kinds, and doubt.
After suffering long from each symptom, as if it were
fatal, I have tried to sum up the whole experience from
the vantage point of ten years of constant struggle.
"Why the struggle? I do not know. Certainly
neither sorrow nor lack of life's experiences turned me
to it. It must be born in people. Perhaps it was a gift

to have had to struggle thus. At any rate, it has all hap
pened along with an exceptionally busy adventure
some life, and a happily married one.
"To tidy up the subject in my own mind I have
hunted up some notes written in the very beginning
of my psychic experiences.
"One night during dinner we and a friend discussed
a psychic book I had been reading. The friend then told
of her success in Russia at moving tables and we were
inspired to try it ourselves, solemnly swearing 'on
honor' to be honest in the experiment. After dinner the
lamps were put out and by the firelight, kneeling
around a small table, with tips of fingers touching the
top and our little fingers joined, we three sat quietly
waiting. After a brief wait we were thrilled by a
strange feeling of vitality in the table and movement
began. Until midnight we experimented, too spell
bound with our own astonishing success to carry out
our original engagement to go to the 'movies.'
"The table tipped once for yes and twice for no, and
moved around the room in designated directions. Next
we tried pencil and paper and had a little success.
Hearts were repeatedly drawn, iove' and 'Helen' writ

done with a pencil held in one person's hand, with an
other person's hand placed lightly upon
it,

bringing with them a Ouija board. With the usual pro
tective veneer of suppressed hilarity, we proceeded to
experiment with this. We tried the board with different
combinations of people, receiving a jumble of sense
and nonsense, vague advice on business, unremem-
bered anecdotes of childhood playmates. Some of the
names spelled out were familiar and others strange. The
impression left was one of confusion, but also a certain
bewildering credence. The first thing that really
moved me was a message from my old colored nurse,
an adored foster mother, who was with me from my
birth to my marriage. Then came my mother, who
had died in my babyhood, and called me daughter, a
name strangely novel and beautiful to me as I had never
known my parents. She urged me to try writing with
a pencil.
"This in private I tried to do, with growing success
each day. At first the letters all ran along together and
had to be separated into words. I kept my eyes closed
in order to free my mind of all outside distractions, but
this was not so necessary later except when my atten
tion wandered or became concentrated on the words
being written. The messages were very simple ones
urging me to continue, but they brought me a strange
and beautiful elation. My mother confirmed my life

had died in my childhood) had been watching over
me and trying to influence me for years. I was pathet

faith and persistence in spite of failure or interruptions
from opposing forces. Great insistence was made upon
practice, constant practice, and keeping my mind a
blank.
" 'This is only a weak beginning. You will develop
rapidly ifyou will only follow our influence. Will you
make a little shrine of yourself for us to work through?
There are many of us trying to get at our loved ones.
After a while you will be able to talk and act with us.
We want you to begin to practice giving yourself up
to us so that we can talk through you. It will take some
time for you cannot know our laws. Sit quietly a while,
think of cosmic things, we will help.'
"In the meantime a telegram had come with the sad
news that Lizzie, a much loved and devoted friend and
retainer of the family, had had a stroke of apoplexy and
was unconscious. I asked the Ouija board1 if she would
recover.
"
'Do not worry, she will not suffer long, she will
come to us in ten days,' the board answered.
"I said, 'Are you sure?'
" 'About,' was the answer. In twelve days she was
dead.
1But by this rime Betty had, I thought, abandoned the Ouija
board for automatic writing. This may be a slip on her part, or
she may indeed have recurred for this purpose to the earlier
method.

"At about this time, also, came a sudden written mes
sage from Stewart's father, asking him to give financial
aid to a friend of ours who needed capital to give him
a business opportunity.
" 'Write a letter at once, now,' the message urged, 'it
is a question of time.'
"We were at that moment in a friend's camp at some
distance from a post office, with no known communi
cation that day, but no sooner was the letter written
than a man arrived who was delivering something and
returning at once, and to him we entrusted the letter.
Later it proved that time was an important element in
receiving the information regarding the loan.
"These circumstances, or coincidences, if you pre
fer, had at least the effect of arousing our interest. We
determined to investigate slowly and carefully and
honestly each step, not letting ourselves be carried
away by any desire of our own to believe or disbelieve.
"Mediumship was now being urged upon me in the
messages. My first and second efforts at this caused a
strange sensation of being lifted out of myself and al
most slipping over the edge, as when just losing con
sciousness under ether. Before letting me go, however,
Stewart demanded assurance that I was really in the
hands of my friends and for this purpose asked for a
test. His father was asked to give the name of an old
lumberman employed years ago, a name unknown to
me. A curious jumble of names of old 'lumber jacks'

failed.
"The next day this was written. 'It will be impossible
for us to answer the tests for the present, because your
father is not yet in our sphere and cannot communicate
directly; as soon as that is made possible we will be able
to convince you. At present it would only confuse you
and not add to your faith. It is disappointing to us to
have the delay, but we understand and do not blame
you. It will be invaluable to have Stewart for us, so we
must wait. We will let you know when we are ready
for the tests. In the meantime we will write you regu

that, and that no evil will come to you, for there are

"During this time and subsequently," Betty's notes
go on, "my mind was exalted with my secret. I was
supremely happy. There followed, however, a sinking,
haunting period of lack of faith in myself. All I had
ever learned of the subconscious mind tormented me
with questionings. Could I be hypnotizing myself with
this thing? The beautiful nearness and protection,
which had been a lifelong companionship, cherished
in the very fiber of me3, suddenly fell away, leaving me
lonesome as a deserted soul. This temporary loss and
struggle, in milder form, took place again and again
after receiving various false predictions.
"Several books of similar experiences read about this
time, and a wholesome and too lively sense of humor
which occasionally brought on a childish and rather
hysterically amused attitude towards the whole affair
undoubtedly saved me at this period.
"My first experience of this kind of false prediction
was astounding. I had asked a very foolish question,

"Shortly afterwards my Aunt and Bertha rang up
and talked to me on the telephone, as hale and hearty
as ever. On returning home, however, I found that at
the time my butler and his wife had been in an automo
bile wreck which proved very serious for her, poor
girl, as her face was badly scarred for life.
"A rather amusing prediction received in the same
hurried manner while on a street car and written on a
paper torn from a package, announced that there
would be a change in my fortunes; that I was to be left

to expect them, or some form of 'interference.' Grad
ually, however, my faith grew until, even in the midst
of my indignation over what seemed a very flagrant
case of attempt to deceive me, I still never doubted
that an explanation would be given, and my desire to
continue was as strong as ever. Only the surface of me
demanded that I assume an injured frame of mind, as
of a virtuous person badly treated. Always, too, I guard
ed myself against too easy credulity. The etiquette of
my world required certain apologies, but the supreme
court within me was rather lenient about the whole dis

it for no satisfactory apologies were given, outside of
vague remarks about these scapegoat forces every fail

cations themselves were sprinkled with inconsistencies
and crude falsifications for which, as yet, no sufficing
explanations — or apologies — were offered. And she
had not, of course, yet learned to edit such things out.
I should not have been much surprised if she had
chucked the whole thing. It took some resolution to
set aside, from an exceptionally busy and colorful life,
so much time for anything so unreliable and doubtful.
For her life was indeed busy and colorful. California
in winter attracts a great variety and number of people
from all over the world. Our friends derisively nick
named our house "The White Hotel" because of the
almost continuous occupation of our guest rooms. We
gave dinners — many of them — and because we invited
people in order to know them, we never set table for
more than ten. Betty served tea every afternoon, soon

regulars she used that hour to entertain such visitors as
she could not quite work in on the "hotel" or a dinner.
The flow through our house was almost continuous.
We had about everything — writers, soldiers, states
men, ranchmen, cowboys, fishermen, artists, stage
people, a Japanese ambassador, a Persian mystic, a Cel-
anese prince. No end to them. A brilliant company on
the whole; a congenial company too, made so by Bet
ty's uncanny ability to lift people to their own tops.
The graceful and gracious conduct of this constantly
shifting social menagerie would seem a full-time job,
but it was actually only one side issue of Betty's many
livery interests. She had three acres of garden which
she managed with the labor of one man — and it was
her garden, not a gardener's garden — minutely dia
grammed by her, down to the planting of the last
pansy, on huge sheets of wrapping paper. With a truly
professional eye she took into account color, height,
background, arrangement, the seasons. And the results
she achieved brought her literally dozens of blue rib
bons in competition with the big estates employing as
many as ten gardeners. In this garden also she collected
and acclimated rare foreign plants and shrubs — con
cerning which even yet I am called upon to write very
ignorant replies to enquiring scientists. It was this col

den Club, injecting into its numerous affairs certain
quaint and Bettyish conceits of her own. For example,
she established (for the Annual Flower Shows) an es
pecial award which was known as the Smell Trophy
to be given for that arrangement judged to produce the
most pleasing blend of perfume! And another — in
cash — to the sculptor submitting the design for a bird
fountain, faucet head, or what-not which was at once
the most artistic and could be the most cheaply repro
duced. All this likewise would seem to be a full-time
job.
But she had just as much interest and zest to put into
all sorts of other outlets for her insatiable energy. She
wove textiles of her own designs; she had a potter's
wheel and did some really charming original pottery;
she modelled in clay. She was deeply interested in
Oriental Art of which she made a serious study. She
wrote — for her own satisfaction, since she showed it
to nobody — the gayest light verse. I found dozens of
such poems, good ones, among her papers. She even
had a flair for catching essentials with spirited, quick
pencil sketches, a talent I had not suspected until one
day in Alaska after we had been married some twenty
years. Something comical in a bear's movements
amused her and she recorded the beast's attitude with
a few quick strokes. And all these various aptitudes she
used merely for her own amusement. It seemed never

It was as though they were simply the varied expres

particularly matter what medium she happened to use.
She never took any of them ponderously, nor did she
pursue any of them too single-mindedly . But they were
part of the "busyness" of life to which she refers.
And lastly, just for full measure, she did a great deal
in social service and charity work — tubercular chil

This for seven or eight months of the year. Summers
we cruised, up the Pacific Northwest Coast. As we did
our own navigation, and had a vivid side interest in

insulation. It may be a comfort and pleasure to feel that
way — that we answer and are near — but how can
you be sure who it is answering you? It is the cheapest,
easiest form of communication. We are building up a
different variety for you and your uses. It is a far more
delicate mechanism and so more difficult to manipu
late. It will, however, be much more reliable.'

Up to this time Betty had, in general, worked alone, with auto
matic writing. However, I was now "sitting in", as a spectator.
The sensation of what she described was similar to the muscle-
jerk induced by an electric current.

"We asked the question, 'Who is jerking Stewart's
muscles?'
"
'An experimental pest,' was the answer. Not until
sometime later did any involuntary movement of mus
cles come to me and then it was unsolicited. A rare
occurrence.
"Until the beginning of my second period, nearly a
month later, this anaemic uncertain frame of mind pos
sessed me. It may have been due to lack of physical
vitality, for I was very tired.
"That I did not abandon the experiment altogether
as a dangerous, useless pursuit — as so many do at this
period — was partly due to an obstinate disposition and
partly to Stewart's interest and encouragement — com
bined, of course, with that of my spirit family. Grad
ually the fog was lifted. By rereading the communica
tions, piecing together bits of advice sent me in regard
to control of my own mind and spirit, and by the slow
subtle impressions that came to me, I worked out a
crude sort of formula for myself. All of a sudden it
was successful, and the pall was thrown off me."

that she was dealing with only the beginnings, for she
had graduated from automatic writing by the first
months of 1920. Her training in the technique of re
ceiving and passing on what she was taught and what
she experienced, was merely a necessary adjunct to her
real job of growth and development. I shall sketch the
latter process in due time; but first let us follow out all
Betty herself had to say, in her own person.

CHAPTER IV
BETTY'S OWN NARRATIVE (Continued)
/.
In the same file that contained the material embodied
in the last chapter I found another manuscript, dealing
with the same subject — Betty's beginnings in this job
of unfoldment, and how and why she undertook it.
The one already quoted was written in 1929. This one
must have been done earlier — in 1922. Nevertheless I
think they must be read in this reverse order. The em
phasis of the 1929 document is on externals, so to
speak, while the earlier one deals more with the inner
impulses.
2.
"For a long time," this manuscript begins, "there had
been an uneasy sense within me of having strayed from
the path I desired. I did not try to think it out, I just
drifted along.
"During my long wanderings under wide skies, in
silent places, the accumulated dust of civilized matter-
of-fact life was wiped off. The fresh new surface was
more sensitive to reflections from the big simple forces

around me, and gradually my old outlook was replaced
by a wider vision. It happened quite simply and natur
ally, without any attitudinizing. I began to grow up.
"Whenever we returned from the isolation of our
wilderness travel, I took up worldly affairs with en
thusiasm, but each time certain things grew a little less
satisfactory and other things vaguely distasteful. Then
came the war to teach vis reality.
"After it was over we looked agam at our individual
lives. I knew the secret of my vague discontent. I had
rediscovered the immense possibilities — outside of
selfness — in what we vaguely call the spirit. I felt my
feet on the road for which I had searched all my life.
The vast accumulated experience of the world had,
oddly enough, been admitted only to the surface of my
mind, and had left little impress on my heart. Like a
child who, with wonder and fascination, discovers
that water is wet and that fire will burn, I began my in
vestigations of the world where lives faith, vitality and
the wisdom of the heart — all the big things we live by
but cannot analyze in laboratories.
"The first idea that came to me was disconcerting.
If I were to die tomorrow, the body I fuss over would
leave me, would leave me standing 'as is'? Standing in
what?
"The awkwardness and unpreparedncss of this in
evitable situation struck at my imagination. It was too
stupid to slouch along in such an improvident unthink

ing fashion devoid of any purpose, of any inner core
which I could retain beyond the moment of this life!
"This rather hazy determination to do something
about it was strengthened by the stimulation received
through automatic writing, which began in the early
spring following the armistice. Now for nearly three
years I have struggled for comprehension, passing from
automatic writing to a curious state of freed or double
consciousness in which I absorb experiences directly,
somehow, and Stewart records them in words spoken
through me, or by me as first hand impressions.
"There has been no sudden reformation of my char
acter, accompanied by a firm grip on destiny! During
all this time of intensely interesting and puzzling mani
festation I had many days of doubt and distraction. I
felt like a child walking on stilts — above my usual self,
but awkwardly maintaining balance. Only recently
has the natural spontaneous happiness of it come to me,
and with it a wonderful feeling of firmness inside,
somewhere apart from my usual surface consciousness.
"Now let me retrace my steps in this quickening
process.
"As I stated, I decided it was high time, and highly
desirable and entertaining, to take control of myself.
The idea was simple enough, but difficult to carry on.
The slothf ulness of the human creature is beyond com

automatic writing before I seriously arranged my busy
days to comply.
"
'Make up your mind to give up a short time every
day to us.'
"
'Set aside an hour, the same hour, every day.'
" 'You will need months of practice.'
"
'It all depends on you and your cooperation.'
" 'Have you anything more important to do? Ask
yourself that question when interruptions threaten and
you are tempted to set this hour aside.'

Do not expect it. It takes much assembling of forces
and much elimination by careful experiment.'

this determination I settled myself and asked politely
what I was supposed to do next. My first instructions
were in the direction of ordering my mental equip
ment.
"
'Can you manage to be more in the mood and give
more time to preparation? It is the only way. You did
not have any success before today because your mind
was absolutely separated from us by worldly affairs.
We are helpless in that case.'
"
'You must think of us as natural everyday friends
who are with you just as others come into your world.'
"
'Do not strain, nor think of us as supernatural. It
is only that your earthly vision is as limited as that of a
new-born baby.'
"
'Be content to let us lead you like a little child,
step by step.'
"
'Drop every worldly, selfish thought. We cannot
give you a formula for experiment. It is a case of condi
tion of mind and soul.'
"
'You must abandon yourself to our method, not
confine us to yours. Let it come to you by degrees,
naturally, as a plant grows.'
"These instructions, and some on relaxing, came
sometimes very haltingly, sometimes fluently, as fast
as my pencil could travel. Always, from the very first,
accompanying each instruction, was a sentence or two
urging me to do my part.

into my everyday consciousness, just what my part
was. It came to me at last as a surprise. It was strength
ened will power; though that does not quite express
it. Firm substance; resolution, is more nearly it. My
part was the holding of myself in control. This was
insisted on until I could have no doubt of what was
wanted of me.
"I knew how good it felt to have a manageable body2.
So why stop there? Why not try, as they urged, to get
control of the mental and spiritual muscles? Here was
training for an exciting new game. I was interested.
There was no use in just sitting and listening. I would
do my part, and see what happened next.
"My first effort was disconcerting and slippery, a
skiddy performance. What I called my mind refused
to stay on the road. Before taking up the pencil I tried,
as suggested, to 'prepare my mind.' Every annoyance
1 had ever experienced, long forgotten, returned to
memory to buzz around like diabolical mosquitoes.
With persistent effort I banished that annoyance, but
its place was taken immediately by an insistent swarm
of trivialities of different character. All my pet hobbies
and pastimes took possession! It was enough to make
one believe in personal devils!

do battle for possession of my own mind. Something
interesting was being said to me, but my shockingly
bad mental manners — squirming, teasing and inter
rupting — kept me from hearing it. At least I should
make myself listen. Then I could calmly decide on the
merit of what was being said. All this traffic of mind
must be dodged. The logical course was to make a
safety zone in the traffic. I drew an imaginary circle
around myself, and stood triumphantly ungettable.
"The pencil began to write fluently: 'When worries
and world annoyances come, you can rise strongly
and determinedly, spend a few moments in calm, and
at once descend, reinforced to the object in hand. Brush
away the stinging fly before he sucks your life blood
and leaves poison in its place. This alone takes much
conscious manipulation to accomplish. You see I am
not giving you noble, difficult tasks to perform. I am
only setting a few simple exercises as a point of contact
in the beginning. Master these and you will have the
vision and strength to see that you are mastering your
self and your destiny.'
" 'We want to urge you, and keep on urging you,
to remember every hour the powers you possess, the
forces you have within you to draw upon. Use them
in every little thing you do. The degree of success you
have depends on the amount of energy put into it.'

"I shall not quote much further. Day after day I was
exhorted to strive for 'habitual consciousness' of uni
fied life. The overwhelming passion of the pleading
kindled the commonplace words as I wrote them.
Could my own lazy, comfortable subliminal (what
ever that may be) stir itself to meet such a frenzy of
solicitation for my salvation? As I had lived with it
many years and knew only its inertness, the evidence
all pointed to an outside force trying to act on my
rather reluctant personality.
"The idea of communication was not new to me. In
my early childhood I remembered that Grandma Mar
in and Uncle Calvert had been the butt of the family
for professing belief in it. What if all these years they
had been trying to reach me and tell me that it is true?
This ceased suddenly to be merely an interesting game,
and became a matter for serious investigation. I deter
mined to throw more vitality into
it;
to keep my head
steady, but to follow with my heart the possibility that
they, my family, were trying to lead me. Whatever
it
was,

must find out.

fort and sympathetic enthusiasm. The depth of wisdom
and the exceptional technique in developing compre
hension of the spiritual life, rather than the evidential
material given, forced us to accept the fact that an out
side being was directing a systematic course of instruc
tion.
"The old absorption in personal intercourse with
friends soon gave way to a bigger scheme. It had to,
perforce. As the instruction progressed they3 devel
oped a lofty disregard of our demands for more enter
taining and personal subject matter. It was evidently
to be their kind of thing, or nothing. Our demands for
experiments, tests, stunts, manifestations were ignored.
This interesting force was not to be bullied. It then oc
curred to me to assume the part of a rather humble
minded eager pupil, and see what such a chastened atti
tude would accomplish. It accomplished much.
"And so, finally, I bent my energies and interest to
trying, from my end, to help the communications as
they directed. I experimented with various forms of
concentration. I also noted the success or failure of va
rious impulses natural to me. And when these were suc
cessful I tried to increase their force, thus evoking my
own spiritual vitality. For example: very early I dis
covered that this vitality was magically successful
when reinforced with an outgoing from the heart, as
in loving remembrance of a friend.

"This kind of thing, however, I hesitate to empha
size. Formulas are dangerous. Your needs are not my
needs. Stability may be the thing I strive for, while
flexibility and abandon to spiritual imagination may be
the adjustment needed for you. My spiritual strivings
may therefore be a misfit for you. You must cultivate
your own modeling power to proportion you so that
you will attract your own developing currents. These
will make you aware of your weak points and aid you
in strengthening them through your conscious coop
eration until the process becomes spontaneous.
"Above all, get this clear: these notes are intended
only to give an example of an individual process, suited
to a particular person. Do not let them mummify your
own life-giving currents by inducing you to expect
anything exactly similar.
"During the years, then, patient experiment has de
veloped in me, together with growing wonderment
and faith, a little comprehension of spiritual law. There
have been many setbacks, struggles, doubtings. In weak
moments I have had an almost cowardly longing for
my old comfortably self-absorbed unawareness of life.
I emphasize this again because the psychic books I
have read describing other people's experiences lay so
little stress on the difficulties. Very early I came to look
upon these writers as beings of a superior clay, utterly
set apart from me. I thought dejectedly how excep

tortures of doubt, my semi-paralytic state of will. If I
did manage to soar serenely, I was sure to flop pain
fully; and then came the real test of strength in putting
myself back. I shall set down the failures and discour
agements, even at the risk of clouding the inspiration.
We have the records of my shining hours; I shall tell of
the slow minutes in between. My own method may be
a painfully slow self-evolution, designed for tortoises,

arrive some day."
(Her intention as to the ultimate use of these notes,
I am unable to guess. Whatever it was, she apparently
postponed it for the time being. She adds this: )
"The whole subject is much too big foi me. What
we vaguely, mistily call spiritual, and look at momen
tarily on Sundays, is as real, natural and joyous as the
flesh and blood we accept as a fact of existence. This
flesh and blood is the pod for the protection of the
ripening spiritual body within us which we inhabit
after death. Each of us must sometime develop this in
ner, bigger self. Ours is the choice whether to lie dor
mant or to start expanding at once from the seed to the
plant, and so occupy increasingly more life. It seems
to be a case of 'eventually, why not now?' And delay
bears compound interest on the amount of effort to be
paid out later.

it generally as true — but unimportant at present; so we
are quite content with our half-life. The moment our
desire for more life passes from the purely mental into
absorption by our consciousness, germination begins.
If it becomes a fixed habit of mind and heart, growth
will continue as it was intended to, cooperating with
an orderly, useful, practical life.
"We have proved the wisdom and comfort of physi
cal hygiene, why not teach the next generation a little
spiritual hygiene? Teach them how to keep their
thoughts clean and strongly muscled, to have faith in
their healthy impulses, to keep open and expanding
hearts. Why not give these their due proportion of
acknowledgment and education, along with the de
velopment of the brain? Our brains are only the mortal
machines we work through, very important as are
good, well-oiled typewriters. Why stop education
with adaptability to this life? Why not a still higher
education? If only for the sake of the full lunged hap
piness there is in
it,
teach the next generation youths
periodically to lift their eyes from the narrow treads
they follow to the wider landscape they may inherit
if
they will."

CHAPTER V
BETTY LEARNS TECHNIQUE
Before finally setting out to follow Betty, as well as
we can, through the twenty years of her inner expan
sion, I must describe — very briefly — the mere exter
nals of technique.
The first Ouija board period lasted but a few days.
The toy seemed to be used only to attract her attention,
and to direct her to a more facile method of communi
cation — automatic writing. Indeed about the only
clearly defined "message" it conveyed was the admoni
tion, over and over repeated, "Get a pencil. Get a
pencil."
I was not present at Betty's first experiments at auto
matic writing, though of course I saw the results even
tually. She described them as slow and fumbling. The
first script was ill formed, without capitals or punctu
ation or spacing, like one long continuous word. She
had to go over it painfully, dividing the words from
one another. Sometimes it was necessary to guess at
some of them, from the context. But they made such
good sense that she brought the scrawls to me. We de
cided to go on with it.
With practice the writing improved. The words

were divided; the letters clearly formed; the sentences
capitalized and punctuated. The whole process gained
speed and certainty, until it had the facility of one
writing a letter about something he really wanted to
say. And the content of the instruction thus conveyed
was so forward looking and yet so practical, that I set
tled back in my own mind to much the same anticipa
tion as I would have had in the writing of a book. Here
was material; here was thetability to write. What more
could one want?
And then, after only nine months of
it,
we were
blandly informed that shortly the writing would cease!
And
it
did!
We resolved to try
a
new technique. Betty bandaged
her eyes and lay flat.
I
took her wrist. This was in De
cember, 19
1
9.
The experiment was an instant success in that Betty
appeared at once to slip easily into
a
kind of expanded
consciousness. Perhaps double consciousness would be
better. Her self seemed to be mainly centered in the
expansion, but at the same time she retained enough
connection with physical existence to talk to me in re
port of what she saw, heard or did.
I
think my touch
on her wrist was what held this channel open. And
I
suspect
I
may, in some mysterious fashion, have con
tributed to the conditions that enabled her to function
in her two aspects at once. At any rate, when she
worked alone she brought back nothing for record,

though she did report in general even greater personal
success. Or perhaps my touch on her wrist was merely
her sort of tea leaves or crystal ball — the device that
opened the channel. I preferred to think the former.
For if my function was only as recorder of what was
said, I shall claim a heavenly crown of patience. Even
after the technique was established, I was often forced
to sit for long intervals, holding Betty's wrist, while
she was most happily busy at her own invisible affairs.
But that is a bit ahead of the story. Though from the
very first attempt Betty managed this slipping into the
double consciousness quite easily, the other aspect — the
reporting back — was a different matter. When she
tried to tell me about it — whatever it was — her speech
was halting, stumbling, fragmentary almost to the point
of incoherence. Obscurely, through that incoherence,
I thought I caught glimpses of something important.
But as compared to our easy, rapid automatic writing
this seemed to be a very ramshackle makeshift. Still, I
was in it for the duration. Gradually emerged a reason
able explanation. In the automatic writing Betty had
been an amanuensis; had merely lent herself as a ma
chine. Now she was to be brought into touch with
realities, which she was to absorb and tell about. Also —
as herself partaker of this superconsciousness — she
would receive direct impressions, would hear words
with some "inner ear." While still in the supernormal
state, she would bring down these things to that frag

"I'd like to: but can I?" "How silly!" "Where do

— after over an hour of this — she turned to me.
"They can't tell me what I'm working toward be

She was immobile and silent for thirteen minutes.
Then she sighed deeply and slightly moved her feet.
"I can move now. Rouse me. It is all over for tonight.
What did they do to me? I was holding intercourse
with somebody, but it did not get back to my waking
consciousness."
I shook her wrist gently, and after a few moments
she came back. Whether I liked this or not I did not
quite know. But Betty seemed no worse for it. On the
contrary, her color was bright, her vitality increased.
The following day's session began again with some
private business which was not confided to me. I gath
ered that Betty was being persuaded to something. "Oh
go ahead; I don't care," she muttered at one time. "I
don't know what you're doing," she complained. "Oh,
do be definite and don't muddle it!" she cried. "I'm
not cross!" she disclaimed, "I've got to breathe!" "I
don't believe it's going to work anyway," she protested.
"-Well, I'll try."
Then ten minutes of silence. Suddenly a guttural
sound in her throat — gr —, a pause, and the sound was
repeated several times, until it extended itself into an
almost recognizable word, grandma. After ten seconds,
very distinctly and clearly the two words Grandma
White. But the voice that spoke them was not Betty's!
By the same slow and painful process came my love;
many more; the name Mary. And finally the beginning
of a sentence, make her —.

THE ROAD I KNOW JJ
It took just an hour for these few words, with a lot of
under-breath rapid comment of protest and apology
from Betty. At last she said to me:
"Doesn't amount to anything. I wish you'd take me
out. I'm tired. It is not coherent, and I cannot help it.
They dull me and then do it themselves."
After this she continued daily to work — and clearly
and valuably — by her old technique of reporting back,
from the other consciousness, in her own person, until
February 1 1, when a second attempt was made at what
might be called "direct transmission." Here is the en
tire result of something over an hour.
"Mary — rather hard — realize difficulties — give
consideration channel — undeveloped. Progress slow"

militate — aren't you sasf —"
(meant for satisfied, prob
ably) "-don't be so-"
Here Betty broke in. "Oh, I'm working so hard!
Why do I have to work so hard!
"
Then, very slowly, with a pause between each word,
but clearly:
"Method new. No more now. Good night. Wake
up!"
Nothing happened for five minutes. Then Betty, to
me: "Wake me up. I'm tired — shoving me around that
way! I stopped breathing — but I found a new way to
breathe. I felt it when it changed. I felt absolutely safe.

She "awakened" presently, of herself, refreshed,
without fatigue.
Nothing further was attempted in the new technique
until February 17, though we had the usual sessions in
that week. After this manner we continued, using Bet
ty's old technique of reporting back in her own person
most of the time, with an occasional laborious period of
practice in allowing herself to be used as
a
mouthpiece.
With such practice the difficulty lessened, the facility
improved. But nothing important was said that way.

checks and stumbles. Until, in other words, the instru
ment was perfected.
People have asked me how I knew — outside the con
text of what was said — when to ascribe to Betty, and
when to the Invisibles. Her voice was slightly different
in quality and timbre, in the latter case: the phraseology
was not of Betty's habit; but the most convincing, and
at the same time unproveable, distinction was a decided
"feel" of personality. That would, of course, mean
nothing to anybody but me; and rarely, when it did
not matter one way or the other, I was not myself cer
tain. But ordinarily I was sure.
I have also been asked about physical symptoms, as
to Betty's condition while in this state of consciousness.
It was obviously trance, but not complete as in the
case of Joan, who actually seems to "go away", leav
ing her organism to be used. Betty was supposed to
work — said the Invisibles — "with intelligent coopera
tion": I cannot do better than to quote from The Betty
Book as to this.
"She was to go to them, instead of their coming to
her. And as intelligent cooperation presupposes
participation, her consciousness was not taken from
her in the customary deep trance. That does not mean
that she was conscious as you and I are conscious. She
was unaware of her physical surroundings — she went
'out of her body', as the occultists have
it,

phase of existence. But in that somewhere else she re
tained her faculties of thought. She was not put out,
drugged. She was transferred Occasionally, but
rarely and only for certain exact accuracies, she goes so
'far away' — as it seems to her — that apparently there
remains to her only a shred of (our) consciousness. But,
that shred is always there, and through it the approach
to 'intelligent cooperation' is always possible."
It took about five minutes for her to become en
tranced, and about the same time to "come out" after
the session was finished. "I'm coming down like a leaf,
zig-zag," she once described her return to normal con
sciousness. I could see no physical change while she was
in this state, except that her respiration became almost
imperceptible. Nor did she ever suffer any ill after ef
fects, even temporary. None of the nausea, dizziness or
the like which some psychics undergo. On the con
trary, she always awakened pink-cheeked and re
freshed.
Now, having finished the external mechanics of Bet
ty's technical training, we are at last ready to back
track, and take up once more her beginnings; but this
time from the point of view of the inner consciousness.

CHAPTER VI
BETTY TAKES THE ROAD
f.
As i look back on these beginnings, I am reminded of
the first handling of a skittish colt; and I admire the tact
and skill with which the Invisibles did the job. They
had, first of all, to get Betty's — and incidentally my —
confidence; they must keep our interest; they must per
suade her — and me — that the thing was worth doing;
and finally must arouse a real desire on her part to go
on. In consequence, the early communications were
sugar-coated with personal matters; but, with the pro
portion of the latter gradually lessening, at last the per
sonal was dropped with a finality that resulted in com
plete anonymity. Only when this was accomplished
did they give us a glimpse of their own point of view.
"The content of first messages through new sta
tions,"1 explained the Invisibles later— six or seven years
later; after they had developed Betty as a reliable chan
nel, "is important only as it serves to retain interest and
does not discourage by too complete irrelevancy. We

The Invisibles used the term station — or receiving station — in
stead of the usual "medium" because, they maintained, the latter
has too many connotations.

are rarely at first attempting to say anything. We are
merely trying to get a reaction to stimulus. If this could
be fully understood, it would be as effective to convey
a single irrelevant word — or indeed mere meaningless
sounds. From our point of view the whole importance
of a considerably extended period of first work is in
the reaction on the part of the station to any impression.
Often in a long alleged message a small phrase, a single
word, or even a solitary syllable or sound is all that ac
tually emanates from us with definite intent. The rest
of the message, so-called, may be a mere going along
with what the station himself unconsciously imagines
to be the purport."
Nevertheless, that bit of genuine response is entirely
satisfactory to them, they went on to say, no matter
how confused or false or contradictory the whole thing
may seem to us. That is because their interest at the
moment is in the process, and not in what is said. How
ever, they admitted, as we at this end know nothing of
the process, our interest is naturally in the content, and
if that content becomes too nonsensical or unbelievable
we are likely to throw the whole thing overboard.
"So," they said, "we give attention to accuracy, or
what you call 'evidential,' only when our hand on the
pulse of your interest or belief indicates slowing down
to a danger point. What we are after is not personal
communication, but development of an instrument
capable of something more worth while."

THE ROAD I KNOW 83
This was a reasonable and logical explanation of the
early puzzlements and bewilderments which Betty-
touched upon in her own narrative. But it could not be
given at the time. She must at first gain her reassurance
and encouragement as she could. Her Invisibles were
very gentle with her.
"I am a friend," one told her, at the automatic writ
ing stage, "you can trust me. We will uphold and care
for you. No harm can possibly come to you. Stewart
must not fear for you. We solemnly promise him to
guard you. We will make every effort to satisfy him.
"Only hold fast to our love for you and your
faith will be justified. Never mind how discouraging
the outlook
is,
continue to believe us. Do not ask ex
planations, only believe."
And after
a
particularly confusing series of experi
ences:
"We have not forsaken you, but we are putting
you more on your own to work. We do not want to
foster dependence on us. Your unhappiness hinders.
Throw
it
off. You have gone stale from being tired.
Rest, and you will regain your outlook. Perhaps we
have been too eager and pressed you too hard. Poor
little girl, we are sorry for you and would comfort you
tonight. Good-night, dear. Are you happier
now? We are as near you as ever, but we have strained

little too much. Forgive us."

struction" beyond her saturation point. She blew up
in a burst of laughter.
"So much preaching!" she cried. "I've never been
so doggone good in my life! Why, I just ache behind
the ears being intelligent!" and then went off in a
school-girl giggling fit, renewed every time I tried to
ask her anything.
"Now," said the Invisible, when at last she had
sobered down, "perhaps you can rid yourself of the
very self-conscious attitude we have been trying to
point out to you. You were getting to be so busy with
your attitude that you could not really listen to us. We
are delighted to see you natural again. We do not want
any solemn, virtuous-feeling saint in place of a very
human little daughter."
2.
The too-hard pressure of which they spoke was an
unremitting effort to arouse Betty's will to persist. At
this time she was far from convinced and was easily dis
couraged. Ordinarily the stimulus of the Invisibles was
gently carried on by appeal to her trust and affection,
or to her common sense and self-respect.
"Do you wish to be spiritually illiterate?

her.
Betty did not grasp the connection.

they. "When you see a child learning to write, you
know how hopeless it looks that it should ever be able
to receive inspiration from the printed page. You are
in just that stage. But you've got to stick to it. In fact
we are going to keep you to it. You've got to learn it
sometime, just as you had to learn to write. Of course
anybody, if he pleases, can remain spiritually illiterate,
but then he will have to live a comparatively common
place existence."
I challenged this last. I could not see Betty as com
monplace.
"By commonplace we mean keeping your approved
boundaries beyond which you make no effort to go.
By restricted imagination, by neglect of the unknown
— by these you keep yourself commonplace."
"But we have our ordinary daily lives to live," I ob
jected.
"It is not your application to little necessary things
we worry about. It's the unbroken application. That's
the thing that makes you commonplace. If you stop
work, even drudgery, often enough, and switch your
center of consciousness to big spiritual proportions,
you can accomplish ordinary life without getting com
monplace."
This reasonable gentleness, as I say, was the rule.
But at times they arose to an almost frantic urgency.
"We lash you to our own frenzy of purpose for your
own salvation. Make a vow to us to carry on our work.

We cannot always come with the force of this evening,
but we want these words to burn into your soul, to be
your obsession, your ruling passion. Power wanes, and
we want to leave you at our highest pitch of urgency,
calling to the deeps of you to answer the great duty."
3-
Almost from the first hesitantly written words, the
Invisibles began to make it clear that they had in mind
an important ultimate aim. Betty, it seemed, was to be
made an instrument for some purpose not yet defined.
We both possessed a healthy sense of humor, so at
first we were inclined to treat such claims with skepti
cism and some derision. They perilously resembled
these super-solemn "especially chosen to bring a Great
Message to the World" assurances with which we had
become familiar through certain of our acquaintances
-
who had stumbled on "psychics." These experimenters
seemed invariably to have been taken in charge by
very important people, such as Plato or Aristotle or
William James or even Julius Caesar and Nero.
But Betty's Invisibles had proved not to be so high-
falutin. They did not pretend to be anybody in par
ticular, and they had not as yet offered any Message.
It was merely that they had a purpose in training her,
which was not so unreasonable when we stopped to
think of it.

"It's only," said they, "that we're giving you a little
encouragement that you are more than a mere by
stander taking notes. It's not a futile task. Once the
inter-relation of all created things is even dimly sensed,
one cannot again be small. The mantle of magnitude
is over the most humble part of the whole."
What they wanted, they kept on repeating, was to
teach Betty how to expand her consciousness. As a re
sult, said they, she would become permeable to the
invisible spiritual forces from which ordinary life in
sulates us more or less. This, for lack of a better term,
they called Contact with the Source. Incidental to it
would come an improved type of this thing they were
now doing so imperfectly — communication from their
world to ours.
"We have been a long time planning this," said they,
"so do not fail us. This is a great experiment for us.
Much depends on you. It is the usual thing to have a
person surrender all initiative as soon as we establish
communication. We want you to gain strength from
us, not lose it and become dependent. Involuntary me
diums are good only as long as the conditions suit them:
a voluntary medium in full control would be invalua
ble. We do not want to be too strong on this side be

It was about this time, I believe, that they dropped
the word medium as too full of connotation, and
adopted the word station instead. About this time,
also, Betty resolved to give these supposed Invisibles a
"sporting chance."
4-
The expansion of consciousness desired by the In
visibles turned out to be no simple task. Betty devoted
an hour or so each day to following directions as best
she could. But this, she herself confessed, was not very
successful, for she could not make out just what was
wanted of her. At first she struggled for a complete,
clear-cut intellectual picture — largely, I think, so she
could satisfy me. But the Invisibles rejected the mental
approach.
"How can we bring to you strongly enough," said
they, "the first principle of what we want you to do?
It is to expand in spirit, not intellectually. The spirit is
usually like a desiccated fruit inside the brain. We
fear to give you too much for that reason. You are too
much in your brain. Let your spirit soak up in a simple
and pleasant fashion until it is a fitting mate for your
brain."
Such expansion, they asserted, would in due time re
sult in the development of an entirely new faculty.

you can listen to us with understanding. Each time you
desire to travel beyond your present country you must
say to yourself: am I thinking and listening in the right
language? Otherwise communication is hopeless."
There was a pause; then Betty said faintly, "I'm go
ing away off now."
"This faculty," resumed the Invisibles presently,
"which we awkwardly call listening, thinking in an
other language, is an expansion of the progressive real
ity within you. You must strive for possession — as a
subconscious fixture — of a faculty not sufficiently de
veloped in you yet. Until you can absorb knowledge
directly with this faculty, you will always be subject
to dilutions, contaminations, dispersions.
"This absorption of comprehension, only partial of
course, carried through the present channels of con
tact, arrives transmuted from the reality of the source
into the symbols of the brain. It is almost useless to at
tempt much further extension of vision until you work
out this faculty for receiving direct comprehension.
The brain is a physical apparatus. It will always auto
matically take what it is able to absorb. But the inner
expansive faculty, vigorously developed, can outrun
the physical apparatus indefinitely."
There was a short pause.
"It is so discouraging," ended Betty, "now I see that
double image at the water's edge — reality and reflec
tion. They look just alike, but they are so different! I

Betty was really working very hard to do her share
well and conscientiously. In fact, as
it
turned out, she
tried too hard.
"Don't strain in these efforts," warned the Invisibles.
"Keep the body relaxed, but free and stimulate the
spirit to respond with
a
great and rising wonder, similar
to that inspired by the overwhelming beauties of na
ture. Unstopper your imprisoned spirit; let
it
rise
blithely and naturally. Enjoy yourself. Don't strain.
Let your heart dominate, and abandon yourself to its
impulses. You will release yourself from terrible intel

"We want none of the usual abandoning yourself to
outside influences," said they at another time. "It

all
a
matter of holding yourself together around
a

firm core of aspiration and interest and aim as to where
you are headed.

added. "Run hard from the curiosity seekers who will

like leeches."
These and similar warnings were repeated again and
again. They insisted that the usual morbid curiosity in
"psychics" led to a by-road, or blind alley, from which
Betty must be blocked.
And another tendency of which she must be cured
was overeagerness. That was a natural mistake — once
her enthusiasm was aroused for this fascinating explor
ation. The Invisibles gave hei some kind of a jarring,
I don't know what it was. I knew there had been some
thing startling going on. I asked Betty.
"You see," she told me, "I was just slipping over
when something happened, just at the wrong moment,
and checked me back too suddenly. And I was so dis
appointed, so eager to go on, that I flung myself back
absolutely wide open, tried to get myself back by an

way. Hadn't we agreed "to give them a sporting
chance"? But to our surprise — to mine at least — it
seemed that was not enough. We must actually enlist;
and of our own free will; and with a plain statement of
decision. Apparently we had not been called upon for
it until sufficient demonstrations had provided materi
als for intelligent choice. Well, now we had them. And
the Invisibles squarely called a halt.
"Escape," they pointed out, "is not merely getting
free. It is taking up responsibilities."
"Before going on with us," they continued, "certain
facts must be faced. You must pay a price to serve our
cause. If you are to succeed, you must go into training.
Are you willing to do it? We do not intend to interfere
with normal life, but you must consecrate your spirit
ual life to us, and conserve its vitality and composure.
"Perhaps this work, if undertaken, will lead you into
paths you do not wish to tread, but once started you
cannot choose. You must take all or nothing, so do not
draw back if we lead you to the edge and tell you to
look. You will be tried in the fires of experience to see
if you are fit to endure."
This, I myself considered, must be Betty's decision,
not mine. I felt that the expansion she had already
gained must have sharpened her intuition to a sufficient
wisdom. But secretly I reserved the right of veto should

"I can stop where I am," mused Betty, "where
nearly everybody stops — with the comfortable crowd.
But the compliment has been paid me of an opportunity
to surmount normal boundaries, to accept the unillum-
ined path of apprenticeship, wrenching myself free. . . .
Oh, the cost of the wrench!"
What the "cost of the wrench" would be she did
not disclose, nor did I confuse the issue by inquiry.
Questions sometimes make cross currents.
"It is life," she reflected. "And I want to get nearer,
nearer to the source of all striving life. I want to smell
the wet earth and feel the cool drip of rocks. I want
to sway with the presence of the wind. That is all life,
life. . . .
"I want to keep close, close as I can get, to that. I
want to sniff
it,

it,

it,

where
I

don't like the dead things. Some
people like intellectual conquest, mechanical things,
making automatons; but
I
don't like that,

crave the
live things; things endowed with self-structure.

I
can partake of the

I

to go out in the wind and the light and the air.

don't
know what you call that current of vitality. . . . Never

She fell into
a

"SEEK AND YOU SHALL FIND"
f.
From this high peak of exalted dedication the Invisibles
yanked Betty down to consideration of the practical —
rather humorously, I thought. All very well splendidly
to defy unknown dangers. Any hero can do that! But
how about the minor everyday penalties?
"They're afraid I minimize the price," Betty told me.
"The price?" I queried.
"Solitude of association," said she, "— but I'm will
ing to pay it."
I was still dumb, so they diagrammed it like this:
Nobody enjoys being considered "queer," I was told;
and what was going to be the use of all Betty's great
effort unless she came into the open eventually, and
applied it in the world of daily living?
The prospect did not dismay her, though it made
her a little sad.
"What a pity if my friends misjudge me," she re
gretted. "They could withdraw so much of the nice,
warm human interchange. I know there will be an as
sault of misunderstanding. They'll all be critical, I'm
afraid; watching me in a suspicious way. It will be hard
for me to rise above their attitude and work unaffected

by it. Well, I know there's a price. There is so much
disapprobation of boundary-breakers."
She considered the situation.
"Well, now we've settled that," she went on, after
a while. "I'll think over how to repel impertinence
with some dignity and conviction of superiority, and
not merely withdraw, or combat in lower terms and
with lower weapons. . . .
"I know what I'll do — I've a right to my own life.
I won't get combative or superior or scornful; I'll get
confidential. I'll say:
" 'Well, I'll tell you. A few times in my life I've seen
treasure trove, something that had nothing to do with
money, or position, or fame, or anything else I can
name, but just a deep, powerful sort of happiness, and
possible to obtain too; and I'm going to get it if I search
through every law, sacred and profane, until I find it.

into my confidence as to what I am after. And it's the
truth, and that's all there is to it."
An excellent attitude of mind, but the Invisibles
seemed not certain that she even yet understood what
she might be up against.
"You see," they said, "everything one does for self-
development — awareness, expansion, contact and all
the rest — has a certain acceptability to the ego con
cerned, and nobody objects. But when you reverse
that, and begin to insist on outgo, offering something
of your own attainment, testing it against the world's
resistance and misunderstanding, then you must expect
a harder time. It is one thing to have a neat chapel to
visit occasionally, and quite another to carry its in
fluence into 'practical' life."
And, said I, while an attitude of mind helps forti
tude, it does not protect from suffering.
"Sensitiveness capable of absorbing wisdom through
direct impression suffers enormously from the world
of combat," the Invisibles agreed. "For as awareness
increases, so does suffering. Because of this, unfortun
ately, the spiritual aspirant often prefers to seek a shel
tered life and become a bystander. Such a person may
have an exquisitely sensitized vision, but he is abso
lutely sterile because of lack of human contact. The
bystander probably regards his reaction as one of fas
tidiousness, but it is really inertia, atrophied force,
overcultivation, loss of productiveness."

Betty recurred to a picture they had seemed to be
showing her.
"I want to look at that chap again," she begged.
"He's quite fascinating, quite exquisite but useless. If
he were set in action, so much of him would break or
crumble or change. What a pity he couldn't be used!
He's such a highly developed specimen."
"The whole point is," insisted the Invisibles, "any
sensitive person is useless in employing the force of the
higher consciousness if he is always vulnerable to the
return blows of the world. Suppose he is trying to ac
complish something, and everybody begins irrelevant
personal attacks, obstructions of all kinds. The minute
he becomes susceptible to all that he is automatically
shut off from the power-current which was going to
help him accomplish.
"You yourself must look out for this. You have
gained access to a shining substance. Now you must
learn to use it against a lower element superior in quan
tity. The toughening process which will make your
bit of strength available must rest with you. Little by
little, in small matters at first, you must learn to pro

ceed faintly shadowed by a strange experience, or you
strive onward toward a hold on the vitality of spiritual
life which will remain unbroken even in your darkest
hours.
"Better think it over," they warned.
As I look back I doubt if the Invisibles anticipated
that Betty would encounter any considerable degree
of criticism among friends and acquaintances because
of her interest in psychic development. As a matter of
fact she met almost none. They were testing her only,
I am sure.
2.
Very well, the Invisibles told Betty, in effect, when
she failed to be impressed by their warnings, if you are
really going on with this thing, you must first of all
realize that mere assent is not enough. "There is," said
they, "no suction quality to passive willingness. We
cannot start things, that part of it is your job; we can
merely complement your own effort."
And — they added this impressively for Betty's own
instruction — it must be done by your own "heart-
desire and not mind-desire." They made much of this
point: it was all-important.
"It is useless just to sit with mental preparation," said

the Invisibles. "You must have the soul preparation,
too — the spirit, not the letter of the law. As soon as you
have yourself established the right condition, we can
come. That is why we are trying to go only as fast as
you can assure your own grasp and accomplishment.
Otherwise we would be taking you from useful things
of the world into a no-man's land of idle speculative
dreaming. This is far from our purpose. When you
do not succeed, seek the reason in yourself. Your sur
face mind may be going through certain evolutions
which have no growth or corresponding demand from
within. In that case you are not truly seeking; you are
apathetically making an appeal which has no oower
behind it to accomplish."
They continued, over many sessions, to return to
this concept, and ever the more strongly.
"Only steadfast determination and striving will
bring you the step further you must go. It is all in your
hands now. We can do little more than watch you gain
this necessary strength before we can help further.
That is the law. We may advise and influence, but you
must make selection and experiment.
"Always hold in mind how much depends on arous
ing yourself. The energy with which you demand of

commanding, but of showing the force which be

"What do you mean by unrecognized forces?" I
demanded. It seemed to me highly desirable to know
with what we were supposed to deal, for I was still in
somewhat of a doubtful frame of mind. My query
caused some hesitation.
"Let us call the whole a matter of inspirational force,
for the sake of giving it a name," was the reply. "It
comes from a combination of conditions created by
the person himself. We only take advantage of this
combination. Once a person of his own choice estab

speaking, the forces we use are emanations from you.

creative selection."1
A little later they summed up very neatly this neces

realize. They don't put any strength into
it,
and when
it
will not work at once, they go the other way. You
must get that strength for yourself."
Another point on which the Invisibles insisted was
that Betty must make haste slowly.
"Do not look on this thing that we want you to do,"
said they, "as something that can be accomplished in
a
year or two. Think of
it
as for eternity. You are strong
er than we hoped, and we can go faster than we ex
pected, but we dare not strain you too far. A few

Remember every waking moment to be really trying

will understand better as you go along.
"Above all," they cautioned, "do not strain for psy

Rather weld together. Hold yourself

spirit healthy and whole, asking to be stimulated to

CHAPTER VIII
THE INNER CITADEL
Shrinking from being misunderstood may be only
one way of thinking too much of one's self.
"The first line of attack here," said the Invisibles
when in due course they did get around to suggestions,
"has to be in the direction of elimination. And that im
plies a deliberate inspection of egoism and coming to
terms with it. Always you are dealing with the ego.
You desire generous and spontaneous blending with
other lives, but there is a toughened membrane — call
it the ego — which obstructs that blending.
"Now in place of this toughened membrane of an
ego which can be wounded, and is sadly scarred by
contacts with life we substitute an indestructible
self, a self held together by intention, and by coopera
tion with universal force; a self vastly more flexible,
permeable and self-controlled."
This substitution of a non-ego self proved to be no
mere figure of speech.
At the next session the Invisibles resumed the dis
cussion. It was in process very simple, they protested.
You do withdraw yourself, in a sense. There is in every
individual, they told Betty, an inner citadel, a "psychic
core."
'It is his enduring center, his seed that will endure.

Search yourself, they urged her, for this constant
within. And then consciously establish it.
"You will not find it in your brain," they said. "Look
for it rather in the region of the heart; or more accur
ately, the intangible sensations that have no organic
position. This is the great security, the foundation for
any superstructure of effort you may want to build.
"The first step in control is the recognition of such
an inner fortress for protection and refreshment. There
is nothing more important than creating this abode of
emotional security, spiritual order and demonstrable
strength.
"You see, the great question is: how are you going
to stabilize yourself among all the shifting pursuits of
the world, the varied points of view, the conflicts and
uncertainties? How are you going to reach reality in
the midst of them? And the only answer is, first to
make within yourself an individual bit of reality over
which you have complete jurisdiction. That
is
your
one method of approach to the ultimate attainment of
complete reality."

I.

and yourself as outlasting them. That's the way to

"Things surge beneath, picking and battering and
fuming, but cannot destroy you," the Invisibles took
it up. "As long as you have this inner power you
needn't mind what is battering against you, nor what
tools or dynamite are used. Such can be only a surface
nuisance. The shell may be scarred, but you have with
drawn the part of you that can be hurt.
"Take your moments of discord and entanglement,"
they challenged. "How are you going to possess your
self?
"There is only one way, but you must have prepared
it beforehand and practiced it: let go your hold of
everything and withdraw into the magic-working
center of life within yourself. It is always possible to
check your nervous reactions momentarily by sud
denly commanding a relaxation, like making yourself
stop shivering. Then quickly combine this momentary
release with a swift retreat to your inner citadel. Go
apart in it and rest the tensions. Stay in peace and quiet
of volition, acquiescing in your whole being to the re-
harmonizing power of your higher consciousness. It is
to your ordinary faculties as is an adult sympathetic
mind to a child's troubles. It helps you clarify your
vision and gather strength to make your decisions and
plan your actions."

And, they added, it is a sure refuge when outside

caught at this aspect, considering it for some time be

I must confess that the early period of Betty's instruc
tion was a tough one for me. I see now that she was
being given the basic foundations, and that some of
them — like the "inner citadel," for example — had to
be given content before they could become practical.
But at the time the teaching was — to me — merely a
point of view. It was fragmentary; it was vague; it came
slowly. For her part Betty was enthusiastic. But she
was having the experiences; I wasn't. All I did was to
sit there for an hour or so, with pencil and paper, tak
ing down what little there was to take down. A great
deal of the time nothing was said by anybody. I patted
myself on the back for being so long suffering. Now I
see I might have made a positive contribution through
some kind of enthusiasm of my own; but the Invisibles
themselves realized that this was a good deal to ask on
the basis of what was offered me.
"You are very patient," they told me appreciatively

I, in the wings, could not see. Once in a long while the
Invisibles tossed me something personal, a bit of "evi
dential," a brief explanation. As a fish is tossed to a
trained seal.
Betty herself realized that her reports back were in
complete.
"Are these words right?" she asked me, rather anx
iously. "They did not get laid just right. . . . Words!
Words! Words!" she cried, exasperated. "We have to
string boundaries of them around even the dimmest
comprehension. And more is there than can ever be
contained!"
But right then the Invisibles apparently did not care
whether or not there was any mental comprehension —
in either of us. They weren't interested in our minds.
Minds came in later, they assured us.
"It is the amateur method to seek growth or spiritual
freedom," said they, "by an intense concentration of
mind; but this must be replaced by expansion of the
heart. That reestablishes the proportion of spirit over
the material, and welds the being into a new function
ing body capable of volition. There is a great difference
between the terrible diffusions of seeking occult power
and the expansion of the heart which arranges your
proportions and makes you a workable reality. You are
past the first danger posts. Do not wonder at silences on
our part. Daily strengthening of purpose by silent
contemplation of your intention, that is what we have

Nevertheless even I could perceive certain definite
steps of instruction.
The first thing Betty was to accomplish was per
meability to the invisible spiritual forces, or Contact
with the Source. The result of this was to be spiritual
consciousness. At first she gained it only in touches,
flashes.
Next she must extend the duration of spiritual con
sciousness until it became habitual. Once she was able
to transfer her headquarters for living from her old
limited, earth consciousness to this expanded con
sciousness, she must learn how to utilize her new van
tage point, and her new powers and insight, in her
ordinary conduct of life and her relations to the people
about her.
That, stripped of all technique, was the program.
And its emphasis on mundane utilization; the immedi
ate application to life, not to some impractical mysti
cism, gave it common sense to me. The ultimate aim,
the fashioning of Betty as an instrument for work after
she had left earth life, was not then apparent to us.
None of this burst upon Betty all at once, as an "il
lumination." The idea and the practice of Contact was

longer than usual. I began to get restless.
"What are you up to?" I demanded at last.
"Getting porous," Betty replied. "Porosity

She
paused to savour this, then chuckled. "That's a nice fat
juicy word!' It sucks in and out.
"When you are cold and enter a room, a warm room,
you say to yourself that you are in a different atmos
phere, and instantly expand to it. That is the differ
ence between ordinary life and the element I'm in."
"What element?
"
I tried for even a glimpse of under
standing.
"It's a new medium of sensation," she explained, "the
most relaxing and yet vigorous state you can imagine —
so abounding in beauty and vitality. It's too wonderful
for me to grasp just yet."
"Can't you tell me more of this new medium?"
"Could you imagine a substance made out of
Spring?" she replied. "Not of individual fresh willows
and buds and blossoms and tender greens and bursting
colors — not those details, but the very sweep of an
entire world decked out; the substance of Spring. Don't
you see how fresh, delicious, exciting, exalting it would
be compared to ordinary things? I am in this superla
tive beauty and freshness and exquisite delicacy. It is
hard to describe in clumsy terms, or name anything
but just the 'substance of Spring.'

Which sounded pleasant and poetic, but those were
the days when I was pragmatic and still somewhat
skeptical. For satisfaction I wanted both reasons and
results. Nevertheless I held my fire and awaited devel
opments. Much instruction followed, whose purpose
I fathomed not at all. For example:
"We would like you," the Invisibles speaking
through Betty told her, "to cultivate to the utmost your
instinct for beauty: form, poems
— anything that has
been achieved by man in his brief moments of triumph
and contact with the over-soul. It is the biggest up
lifting material thing you can possess. . . . Do not be
afraid to drink deep of beauty. It is an open door
through which you can glimpse what is to come: beau
ty, all that is harmony and in opposition to discord.
Beauty is a great and quiet teacher. Detailed education
is very important, but it is beset with many restrictions
and pitfalls. It is a wise teacher who keeps his pupils
looking at the end of the vista instead of watching their
feet on the narrow path they walk."
To me, sitting on the sidelines, that sounded a good
deal like urging Betty to be Betty! But day after day
they kept her at whatever lay behind their words.
"Beauty and love," they insisted. "You hear us say
love so often that the word ceases to convey any idea
to you; but it is the all-containing, permeating essence
which will unite your world to ours. We wish we had
another word for it. But we see it as the first principle

of growth. Open the flood gates, let the great current
of the universe pour through you to others, if you
would live."
Much of Betty's instruction was given in this mood
of poetic imagery. Again the Invisibles would express
themselves in what seemed to me more practical terms.
"Don't try for anything," said they on one occasion,
"but just the feeling of a substance as physically per
meating as ether or gas or something like that. Try
simply, in relaxing, to feel that this substance permeates
every inch of your body. Accustom yourself to the
feel of it. You will find it will rest you and bring hap
piness even in the very beginning. You have tried it
before; but this will visualize it. Do it at any time; mo
mentarily. It's an actual fact, this inlet of strength."
There was a pause, evidently for experiment.
"Anybody could do it," said Betty presently. "It is
a matter-of-fact law. I don't see anything 'psychic'
about it. I am just studying the law; and little by little
I am demonstrating it. The biggest thing you can study
is this permeating strength, and how much of it you
can take. I lie here and strive according to the poor
little rules I have discovered already, and something

aware of my own possibility. I am just a poor feeble be

"Here are the only tasks we give you now," con
cluded the Invisibles, "first, love — attract unselfishly;
second, as we told you before, walk through your days
as a creature with folded wings, conscious of the pos
session of another element and of your ability to enter

Betty's faith was not ill-founded, but also its fulfill

delayed matters for

far from being credulous or an easy mark. Her long line

Betty must have been able to obey orders, for shortly

For some little time Betty was silent. Then she an
nounced:
"I've always before stuck my head up through a
hatchway and tried to look around; but now I've
climbed up. I'm all here but I don't know what to do."
She chuckled.
"This is a great game — a great game, I tell you what!
Like a fairy story My, but this is the life!
"
Again she was silent.
"Well, I've got to do something about it now. I can't
just stand and say how nice it is. All the old ideas and
sensations are under-foot, as though I had taken off my
clothes and were standing on them ready to swim
Butwhat'Mdo?"
"Never mind," said the Invisibles, "just go on."
"You must have brought me here for some reason,"
Betty insisted. "What is it? I'm listening."
Once more the interval of silence. Then she laughed.
"Supposing," she began, "just supposing you sud
denly found yourself free as air, released into the big
ness of the solar system as compared with the earth.
Supposing you were just jumping with energy and
eagerness and enthusiasm, and the only danger seemed
to be spreading out too wide and maybe dissolving
yourself. And if you had no plan about what you'd
accomplish with all that bursting energy — That's just
my trouble now. Generally people make plans first.

Then, when the plan is big enough, energy is meted
out. But here I am, all dressed up in energy, and no
place to go! I don't know what to do first. It's too
big. . . . My inwardness isn't big enough for it. I want
to give it to you — lots of it. Maybe that's the reason it
is given to me."
She contemplated this for a moment.
"If I could only thicken it up a little," she mused,
"so you could use it."
There was a short pause. Then, sadly:
"I can't thicken it up enough!"
"The general trend is toward a more spiritual life,"
hinted the Invisibles.
"All right," I put in my oar, "what is 'spiritual'?"
"It is just daily life carried on by a self with higher
associations," was the answer. "That daily life can eith

it is dwarfed, you are not conscious of

just as you
are not conscious of an atrophied organ. When itbe

In other words, she must first absorb the concept —
whatever it was — and then understand it. But under
standing, in the Invisibles' definition, seemed to be
something more than mere mental appraisal and judg
ment. It was a kind of incorporation into the substance
of one's self. The Invisibles called this "make-it-so"
borrowing the phrase by which a navy officer makes
official a happening aboard ship. "You must not only

it,
but you must make-it-so before

Many different primary phases were mixed in with
the first development of the idea of Contact. In addi
tion to the inner citadel, there were, for example, such
things as insulation, elimination of undesirables, and a
half dozen other technicalities fully treated in The
Betty Book, but out of place here. That is what I meant
when I said that to me at this time the instruction
seemed fragmentary. As far as I was concerned the
lack of sequence was maddening. The Invisibles would
bring up a brand-new topic of instruction or discus
sion; would get my interest just nicely started on it;and
then drop
it
in favor of something entirely different.
They gave things in dabs. Sometimes they had four or

purpose of the indirection. In other words, arousing
too directly the interest of Betty's subconscious mind
would have resulted in what we called "coloring";
which means that the said subconscious would take
over, more or less, and inject its own ideas. In the early
stages of Betty's training this had to be carefully guard
ed against. After about five years, however, such pre
caution was no longer necessary. Betty herself had
command; and the "sub" had not a look-in. Then, to
my satisfaction, the little-dab method was abandoned.
That was one answer to my question. There was an
other, but the Invisibles gave it only after Betty had
gone beyond the need for that technique.
"For purposes of study there is over-magnification
of a part," they now told me. "To avoid misshapement
there must be occasional pauses to contemplate this
magnified part in relation to the whole. That
is,
the
part must be shoved back and diminished to its proper
relationship. The constant changing of subject to
which you have always objected
is
the only method
we could devise of accomplishing this purpose.
It
al
lowed the picture to retire to its proper proportions."
That satisfied my mind. An unusual concession on
the part of the Invisibles. For
a
long time they seemed
to have almost
a
contempt for intellect. That proved
not to be really so. Merely, for the moment, the intel
lect was not the appropriate tool; and moreover as

tellect almost exclusively, forgetting the non-intellec
tual — shall I say intuitional — equipment which now
the Invisibles wished to bring up to correct balance.
But, as usual, they did not explain this until the fact was
accomplished; and that one thing came nearer throw
ing me off the whole business than anything else.
My life had been one that required a very active use
of the intellect. And if my mind could not endorse a
thing, then it was out, as far as I was concerned. Now,
apparently, I was being asked to accept things without
that endorsement! I say apparently, for later I found
out this was not at all what they were asking. I under
stood, finally, that I was not to set aside intellectual
judgments: but merely to postpone them until the ac
complished fact. Then I could use my mind as criti
cally as I pleased. Indeed, the Invisibles wanted me to
do so!
The whole thing boiled down to one simple state
ment: the brain is the executive, not the originating,
branch of our personal government.
Why did they not tell me this, in so many words,
right at the start? I did not know, and I was annoyed.
But that was not the Invisibles' way of doing things.
They never told us until after we had experienced.
Evidently we were supposed — as the cowboys express
it — to "roll our own."

Invisibles answered one of my protests. "It is just a very

fine shadow. The simplest achievement is so much
more important. Pure intellect is aloof, unrelated."
From her vantage point in the other consciousness
Betty accepted this more readily than did I.
"There's such a great difference between your brain
and mine," she told me. "Yours is a much better hu
man faculty — so much stronger." But she added, "I
can't see why it's so much less absorbent than mine. I
don't understand that. It's very puzzling to me — very
puzzling. I don't see why brainless instincts like mine
are so much easier. . . ."
Neither could I. And even the Invisibles refused
help.
"They've gone and left me to puzzle this out," said
Betty. "I admire brain so much I don't understand.
It looks like some nonconducting quality — a sort of
gloss, like glass. There's something

She broke off for a moment, as if listening.
"Where's the catch?" she ventured.
Again the listening pause.
"Oh, I see! Looks like a ship running with a very
strong starboard light and almost no port light. It's a
one-eyed thing. It's the other eye they're trying to de
velop in me."
She studied this a few moments.
"I am getting to understand it a little now," she con
cluded. "The brain looks like a petty officer. Whatever
it is incapable of handling it denies. Through genera

wiser inner self, which is adapted to handling the high
er world of senses and possibilities, the vitalized world
around us, what lies outside human-set limitations.
They are not really limitations except as we cramp that
inner self."
Betty seemed satisfied. I was not. I wanted to see,
with the practical eyes of my mind, where I was plant
ing my feet. The Invisibles were patient.
"Make the leap," they urged. "Dare to do it. Take a
chance on our being right. You cannot connect up in
an unbroken series of steps with what you know. This
reality is not on the outskirts; a gap must be bridged. It
is very necessary to employ the measuring stick of your
mind ordinarily; but lay it aside intermittently. Hurl
yourself into space, as it were. It will not hurt you to
go bravely out to pick up a clue or two. You've been
trying to creep up on things on the scientific side, but
they've got to be boldly taken, artistically, in the pres
ent case."
"I see what they want!" cried Betty. "Supposing
you had to prepare a turtle to become a lark. . . . I'm
showing you how to break up the inertia. This leap
ing, hurling business; this releasing — whatever you
want to call it — is definitely the only way to take pos

was something I did not approve at all. I was very dif
ficult at that period; and if I seem to be doing a lot of
talking about myself, it is only because I believe my
first view was that of the hard-headed, practical, aver
age man in the street. The phrase "insult to one's intel
ligence" occurred to me.
"Don't be offended in your intellect," the Invisibles
told me. "Give us a chance. Your precious intellect will
have its innings. We-won't do more harm than present
it something to work on for the rest of its natural life.
Leave it in soak and keep it flexible, and we can go on.
It's bound to be satisfied later. When this other faculty
becomes the leader, your intellect must immediately
react to it: it must, just as the blood goes through your
body to nourish all parts. Do you get the idea, now?
Something beyond what you can understand, can ex
plain with the brain"? If that is what we want to get to
you first, how could we get it through your brain with
out the slowest of evolution?"
As a statement that made sense.
"Please note," they pressed home their point, "you
will not get scientific explanation such as you expect.
You will get the reality as we can manage to give
it,
which you can deduce as theory later. We cannot tell
you in words which would convey anything to you,
what we must accomplish by molding you to the thing
itself."

The molding, it proved, had a definite and ordered
method. Betty was much amused at the process.
"It's like children dressing up and playing lady," she
commented. "I'm pretending I'm what I'd like to be.
It's absurdly dignified."
She laughed heartily.
"You ought to see me! It's the way I feel when I
wear a train!
"
It all still looked fuzzy to me, and I said so.
"Couldn't you just take it on faith?" they urged.
"Couldn't you just pretend for a time, to give it a
chance to work? If this reality is ever to be recognized,
it must be by something hitherto unrecognized in law.

to your farthest limits in search of comprehension of
the hitherto unknown. You must gain it in imagination
first: and then work back through slow steps to con
nect it with observed facts."
And there I was stopped again! By a word! Imagina
tion. I am a fiction writer and I know something about
imagination and its power to conjure elaborate struc
ture out of thin air. Also it had kin-folk, such as "wish-
fulfillment" and "compensation fantasies." Even Betty
was doubtful.
"I don't think," she objected, "that's a very good
word — imagination. It's too cobwebby with unreal
ities."

128 THE ROAD I KNOW
The Invisibles seemed openly astonished.
"Imagination?" they cried. "Why, that is the very
gateway of reality! You call it a plaything. You've al
ways called it a plaything. But actually it's the one
thing you possess that connects you with the next sub
stance. It's a transmuting chemical."
"It's been the father of a big brood of mistaken
ideas," I grumbled.
"Nevertheless," they insisted, "it's the way to get
outside yourself. How else could you function beyond
your fleshly limitations? But use imagination master
fully — not as an onlooker: as a partaker.
"The whole trouble," they added, astoundingly, "is
in using too little. A little imagination has no strength
to fight. Instead of freeing, it is captured, a poor little
helpless thing. A little, taken and concentrated on,
shut off from its source of supply, is devitalized, dead."
They had made one convert.
"One must try harder to get hold of the idea and
play with it in symbols," agreed Betty enthusiastically.
"You've got actually to be, in imagination, dripping
big-leaved plants in the sun against the blue sky. You've
actually got to breathe that idea in before you can
make it work, because you are not working in our ac
customed substance; you are working in a higher crea
tive form that you don't know how to use, except un
consciously and as it were, relaxedly. When you get to
a certain age and dignity, you don't play that way. You

should. I am not at all impressed by any age or dignity.
I am just impressed with actual things and the necessity
for them."
Whatever my doubts, Betty was completely sold on
the idea.
"I want to go on where it is free under the law," she
continued. "I want to go on and be more and more the
inheritor of these influences. That's it: I want to in
herit the law. As soon as you become clean-souled and
free-spirited you inherit the law; and that law is a kind
of evolution structure. It is what carries you on beyond
little man-made experiments. They are so poky!
"

No discussion of process would be complete were
I to omit the exuberant joyousness of the whole per
formance. This was in no degree damped by the hard
and serious work. There was plenty of that, but never
did the Invisibles permit it to become portentous or
overpowering. Nevertheless it cannot be denied that
ordinarily revelation has a certain drag to it. Saints and
Holy Men are proverbially grim and uncompromising.
Betty's Invisibles were careful to avoid this. And Betty
herself was by nature such a gay and chuckly person
that she reacted wholesomely against any inadvertent
overstress.

scorn. Giving up a thing — anything — instead of using
it in its proper proportion is merely an indication — as
Betty herself had always maintained — that you are
afraid of it. Funny diets; abstinences of any kind; strict
physical regimens — all that sort of thing — were def
initely out.
"No negations of any kind interact favorably on the
higher centers," said they. "That sounds like a danger
ous doctrine, but in reality the danger is more apt to
occur on the side of damaging the spontaneity of the
body's functions — its buoyancy and equilibrium and
youthful confidence and carelessness. Only too easily
the aspirations of the inner life misinterpret themselves
into such restrictions as an over-regulated child would
suffer."
Nor would the Invisibles permit either of us to tan
gle ourselves up in the conventional ideas of "service",
"duty", "will-power."
"It's not will-power at all!
"
they protested. "Every
thing gets so stiff and painful when you do it from the
will-power side. Get at it more from the spirit-power,
the desire-power side. There's a lift to happiness and
harmony which is so much easier than this painful will
power method. This other is like the hard work you
do in play. It's glowing, quickening, a life-begetting
thing."
Betty considered this.
"Work . . . production," she ruminated. "Work is

painful; production is better. What can I get that is self-
acting? Creation is the nearest to it. That is a cleaner,
brighter word. People do not create under a lash."
"Above all," said the Invisibles, "don't forget the
importance of joyousness through all work. That's the
big thing. Think more about that. There is no excuse
for dreariness. Dreariness is just contraction."
You must never do things merely from a sense of
duty or "service," said they; you must do them because
you want to do them. And you'll want to do them
when you've developed full consciousness! Better not
to do them at all otherwise. And, they added astonish
ingly, you can give to others effectively only from
overflow! Duty-and-will-power has no momentum;
what they called "automatic-quickening" carries far.
And that accompanies only a real desire, and a real en
joyment in the game.
"Keep your attention on savoring, joyously absorb
ing what you get with the effort," they advised. "So
few people are acquisitive enough — so few absorb all
they could after they have made the effort. They take
only in proportion to what they spend, when there is
so much more to be had with a little more effort on the
joyous side instead of the struggle side."
"Oh!" cried Betty delightedly, "I've been given an
attribute of bouncing! We don't any of us bounce high
enough — not enough recoil. If we want to be far-flung
in happiness, we must think more about the end and

less about the effort. We are too near-sighted: we look
too much for what is in clear focus. We should look
more to the ultimate reward."
She checked herself. Then with a comic effort at
dignity:
"That is a very nice swelly idea. It swells me nicely!
"
"The way to free yourself," concluded the Invisi
bles, "is by expansion of the heart. It is the only possi
ble instrument for shaping your destiny. Without
it,
the rest
is
struggle and suffering and delay. With
it,
all
is
an open door!"
This moving forward blindly in
a
fog, so to speak,
had its clear spots of summary. Every so often, when
Betty had advanced to
a
certain completed phase, she
was presented with
a
blue print of the ground over
which she had passed. Sometimes this was cast in
a
formula, but accompanied always with
a
warning that
it
was no hard and fast rule, but only
a
summary of
progress. Here
is
an example, given in early days — in
1920.
1. The relaxation of the body.
2. The inflowing of the living waters of the spirit.
3.
In order not to be swept away by them, the mak
ing of "stability," which had been symbolized by
Betty as her "shaft." (See The Betty Book.)

4. The exertion of will power just to overcome the
dead lift; the effort then to climb out; the pushing
against the strong current. Then you are ready to
start.
5 . The putting on of blinders against the earth mind,
and thinking with the heart. That is the first out
going; all the rest has been incoming.
6. The feeling of union with all created things, the
expansion sideways supplementing the upward.
At the time this was given, Betty's experiments were
still confined to more or less formal sessions under def
inite control. But now she glimpsed a different possi
bility.
"That accomplishes a definite something, as a pro
visional formula," she commented on the above.
"However, I think it can be used, not only in this trance
state, but in every-day life. It can be used in the life we
live, without a bandage over the eyes. It would become
then as inspiration, a long breath."

CHAPTER XI
LEAVING THE BODY
#.
Undoubtedly when entering the higher conscious
ness, Betty had from the very beginning "left the
body", without appreciating the fact. As soon as she
realized that she was actually so doing, the Invisibles
began to teach her how to do it consciously.
"Escape from the restrictions of the body," said they,
"and life outside the restrictions of the body, even
while you are occupying
it,
can be experienced. That
is
the real life. How can any sensible person doubt it?
We are trying to shatter the bodily conception of life
in order to expose the other to view. The discovery of
this other conception and the gradual acquisition of
it
is
what constitutes the raison d'etre of your existence.
If
you do not discover
it,
you have failed; you are either
standing still or slipping back."
Most of the training to accomplish this was techni
cal, intended for Betty individually, and in no sense to
be taken as general instruction.
It
was only one of the
necessary means to an end. So
I
quote bits here and
there from the record merely to give
a
picture of the
sort of thing that went on.1

"I see!" said Betty, in running comment. "Now!
Just to slip off my body. . . . leave it lying on the
floor so much easier to work from this end back. . . .
I'm getting so much more at home here."
An interval followed, with no comment.
"Now they've brought me back to contemplate my
body. They think I can improve my control
"
Again the pause.
"They're just letting me into my body and out again
— just a flash, to get control of doing it. . . . It's won
derful practise in a kind of balance — in keeping my
spirit so balanced that it gets no drag from the body
I've got to keep quiet to do this, or I'll never get any
where. . . . This is fine! So much more strength this
way! See how much quieter I am lying."
"Practise in leaving the body," said the Invisibles to
me by way of explanation. Then in command to Bet
ty: "Enter the body. . . . Now release."
"I've got to keep leaving and entering, alternating,"
said Betty.
Short silence.
"My head and neck are tired in my body," she com
plained presently. "I'd like to turn. . . . I'm going to
try. ... So painful to think about my body."
She tried to move, but failed.
"Shall I move your head for you?" I asked.
"Toward the wall," said Betty.
I obeyed.

"That's better."
There ensued a long silence — but obviously a busy
silence.
"I can't hold it any more," said she at last. "I fell
over. I oughtn't to have done that. Now I can rest, they
say."
Here ensued another long silence, but this time ob
viously not busy.
"Try once more," the Invisibles told her at last.
Another pause.
"Yes, I can do it!" said Betty. "Now wait until I
alternate again. ... I did it! That's very, very useful."
The "lesson" continued thus for upward of an hour.
Then Betty was free to tell me a little something about
it — while still in her trance state.
"You withdrew all attention from your body, which
is very difficult," she told me. "I thought of it as so
heavy as to be impossible to move; while I, the living,
left it in the corner and walked off in my spiritual body.
That worked until my hay fever wanted to make me
sneeze.
"The main thing is that, during the day, about your
affairs, you can at odd moments, practice retiring to
that spiritual body. Withdraw attention from the
other, until you get helpful control. It is very impor
tant for me to learn it

"It is a matter of withdrawing attention from one
thing, and giving it full strength to another. It must
be done before I can go on. They can't keep on drag
ging my body around. I've got to get control so I can
leave that entirely behind. They say the reason I always
come back so soon is that I'm a self -stopper. I've got to
stop wobbling and prepare to go all the way and not
want to snap back. It is like standing on my head. It's
that 'Oh dear, I'm going to wobble and come down'
idea that brings me back."
"The more you can relax the body all the time," said
the Invisibles, "the more power you possess and the
more you can use the spiritual in contact with the
physical. Ignore the body, except for its necessary
functions. The first point is to keep it in health, so that
it can be the more easily ignored."
"Now I am going to do it over again," said Betty.
"This must be made more trustworthy. . . . Such a
strange light. . . ."
For some little time she was silent.
"I can travel a little now," she resumed. "Getting
the idea of unattached motion. I've been so tethered
before. But it is hard for me to see; it's so dim."
"One of the most powerful forces is belief in your
power to do it," said the Invisibles. "That combined
with effort to make good in
it,
will accomplish almost
anything. Without that you sink into your own limita
tions and consider them impossible to overcome. But

if you get the belief that it can be done and back it up:
presto! It is done, and you have opened new doors. It
is the halfness of trying doggedly without the belief
that gets you nowhere."
"I've always wanted to explain that holding-steady
process that gets you here, but I've never been able to,"
said Betty. "I think I'd call it a condensation of pur
pose; but condensation is not quite
it,
because
it
de
pends so much on expansion and breadth of percep
tion."
2.
With practise, "getting out of the body," like the
other things, became for Betty less and less
a
question
of concentration and struggle. One day — after several
months of off-and-on practice — she suddenly seemed
to understand the knack.
"Why!
"
she cried, somewhat astonished, "I can slip
back and forth easily today!
It
is
very strange! The
wind swept through me as
I
came in.
I
hailed
it,
did
not crouch before
it,
and
it
went through me as sun
goes through you.
I
wasn't conscious of my body any
more;
I
was just conscious of vigorous well-being
al
most as disembodied as one could hope to be. Harmo
nious vitality superseded the mortal sensation."
She paused in her reporting, apparently trying out
her newfound skill.

"I like slipping back and forth that way," she con
fided presently. "I don't see why it isn't just as inter
esting a performance, and vastly more desirable, as
learning to swim in an element that is not your own.
It is just as natural, really. I just leap out of myself, and
take a dive into a freer and more stimulating element.
Each time I do it it gets easier; I am more at home in
it;
and more stimulated by it.
I
am not tremendously good
at
it;
but it's just as simple as that."
h
From then on Betty had little or no trouble with the
"getting out" part, but the return to the body without
undesirable repercussion, so to speak, was another mat
ter.
"The danger of this experience
is
always in coming
back," she explained to me, "in arousing the body, like
an invalid who thinks she's been abused That's the
attitude with which you must look at your bodily
weaknesses always. You must be their trained nurse,
giving them only such attention as
is
wholesome and
such care as
is
necessary and such sympathy as
is
good
for them
"
She broke off to consider this.
"And," she continued, "there's no use saying, Til
do
it
next time.' Not next time: this time. 'This
is
the
only time there is,' — you must say that to yourself.

method; you're non-existing

"Listen," said the Invisibles. "There

a
kind of in
valid's room in which your body has established its
habits and weaknesses. You are coming back now, but
you are not going to let your active, vigorous, pulsing,

CHAPTER XII
REST ON ATTAINMENT
i.
All of Betty's instructions, and all of the work she
was called upon to do, conformed to the law of rhythm.
That is to say, she had alternate periods of activity and
of rest. But the usual notion of rest as semi-comatose
loafing was promptly knocked from under us. After
a prolonged period of what she termed "striving,"
Betty considered herself entitled to what she called a
"sag-back" party.
"The way you sag back when boresome callers go
at last," she explained.
And at once she made an astounding discovery.
"Why!" she cried, "that's funny! It certainly is! I
hunted and hunted, and there is not any place in the
whole universe where you can slump! I fell be
hind looking for it. Now somebody's helping me catch
up just to see what it feels like, the difference. No place
to slump! Not even when you catch up! It is less strain
to keep your place, it's a more comfortable feeling
there's no standing still You can stand still,
if you want to," she decided after further investiga
tion, "but you can't sit down."

This paradox puzzled her. She retired into another
of those inner experiences of hers which I always
hoped was going to mean something or other to me —
in time.
"They straightened me out in fine shape," she con
fided presently. "I had lost my equilibrium and sat
down. It's a funny thing, but you can't do that; you've
got to keep going when you once start. It's as if you
were to decide that your heart had beat long enough,
and you thought you'd stop it a while."
It was only later, and after several sessions of grop-
ings, that she again reported anything to me.
"After every great spiritual effort I've always been
left with a slightly vacuum-like spent feeling," said
she. "As if I'd put in my all and was entitled to a vaca
tion, a slight reaction, a slump, getting back to a
comfortable and ordinary level. That's the way I've
been doing, the way everybody does. Well now,
there's another kind of relaxation, another kind of rest.
Instead of going back each time to your own starting
place, which is merely an unnecessary habit, discard
that idea, and enjoy resting on the. . . ." She stumbled
for a word or phrase.
"Rest on attainment," supplied the Invisibles, cryp
tically.
Here was a new concept for Betty to absorb and to
clarify.

"The only relaxation is in accustomedness," the In
visibles tried to explain. "When you get accustomed
to a thing it does not tire you; you can rest in your at
tainment. You may just as well give up right now any
idea of slumping, because you never can, unless you
back out. All you can do is to work so hard you get
used to
it,
so that
it
doesn't tire you. There's great joy
in
it,
though, when you get there."
It
did not sound very restful to me.
I
said so.1
"They say
I
mustn't think of being wracked and
spent and tired," said Betty. "I must rest in what
I
have
attained. That
is
the real refreshment.
It
doesn't tire
you so much when you start expandingifyou rest on
what you've attained. That's quite nice!
It transfers
your center of consciousness. Such
a
new way of rest-
ing!"
With an air of discovery she announced that this

"But you missed the point," Joan writes me, in comment on this
part of the MS. "Of course you 'rest on attainment'! Take mere
physical dexterity, like learning to knit, which
I
did not do until
about five years ago. My fingers were stiff and clumsy;
I
lost
stitches off my needle;
it
was very hard for this old dog to learn
new tricks.
I
was about to give up in despair. Then suddenly
I
could knit! Now when
I
am weary
I
rest myself by knitting.
Work one knows how to do
is
never wearying when pursued
normally. We rest on that attainment, and only tire over some
new process of learning. Transfer this fact from the physical
into Betty's spiritual, and you'll understand."
I
think Joan
is
right.

feeling-tired-business is largely a matter of what the
body seems to expect of us.
"I am apt to think I am tired when I come back," said
she, "but it's only a peevish kind of resentment of my
body. I'll just ignore that. I'm not tired: I'm just used,
— like a slate. I can brush it off and fix it.
"I must never," she continued, "admit a weak or
tired thought at that stage. If I do, it dilutes the im
pression; like leaving something unstoppered. It runs
out."
"Stay up on your hilltop; make yourself at home
there," advised the Invisibles. "No sense in you — the
real you — coming back. Rest up there and have a new
starting point. This going back every time is just poor
technique. You can do
it,

"Now listen," said the Invisibles, "there's no restless
feeling of perpetual motion about it. It's more a feeling
of warm existence, like quiet and very active rays. It's
like the sun growing things — that kind of life. It keeps
you living outside, in advance of yourself, instead of
occupied with your physical self."
"I'll try it," agreed Betty, "I won't allow myself to
think when I'm tired. When I'm tired I'll be in a der
rick and lift automatically without thinking. It will
probably work, if you say so." She sounded doubtful.
"I see — it will be outside of myself. It'll take some do
ing!" She chuckled. "Me a derrick! Make it mechani
cal. I see: instead of damaging my real substance by
drawing on it. All right; come on, we'll go try it."
"Don't spend yourself on what your mechanism can
do," supplemented the Invisibles.
"I know lots of things but I can't teach myself
them," observed Betty quaintly, "I want to go now
with myself that knows lots of things. It's nice not to
try to understand, just to know." Ensued a long pause.
"I did not come all the way back!" she cried trium
phantly, "I distinctly did not come all the way back
today. I may not be able to stay there
"
"The main thing is not to slump back automatically.
You can be at ease without being out of formation,"
said the Invisibles.

"What was that expression?" queried Betty. "Rest
in attainment. At first I thought that a terrible idea.
But there is rest to it. Only, I don't get it unless I've
attained. It's the rest you find in being unconscious of
your struggle because you are strong enough for it."
Apparently she eventually surrounded the tech
nique to her own and the Invisibles' satisfaction. Years
later she had this to say:
"It used to be such an effort to keep going: now it's
such a discomfort to stop. My being seems to consist
entirely of the feeling of a machine in action. I'm set in
action; wound up; my machinery is going. It's the feel
ing of the next stratum of energy above us which they
talked about."
There is indeed, said she, a rhythm of rest and ac
complishment. It is the rest of incoming and outgo
ing.
"I wish I could find a name for it all. There is a
poised well-being about this thing. It is a vigorous rest.
I'm enthusiastic and vigorous; yet I'm resting with
out slumping. How would I say that? Rest isn't the
word: it's a pause of consciousness. It's a kind of radia
tion, which is a sort of worship. There ought to be
some name for that pause in application that sort of
shoots out. It ought to be done lots, to fill up the gaps,
to heal. Lots of it is needed everywhere, all through
life; it's a kind of ventilation. I'll just do it a while and
see if some word comes up to claim it."
But no word did.

CHAPTER XIII
THE NEAR COUNTRY
When Betty first set out on her Road, it seemed to her
— and hence to me —that she journeyed far to touch
even the first contact with these new and strange
"forces". And when she came actually to that phase in
which she "left the body" in order to explore or to fol
low wheresoever in the "other consciousness" she was
led, the impression of distance was deepened. She so
expressed her experience. — "I'm going away off now."
"My! I'm going deep! . . . Still farther?" "I'm being
taken away now." Always the impression of travel to
some remote destination. And when she faced back, the
return trip seemed to her as long.
This impression, astoundingly, proved to be an il
lusion. It arose, I think, partly from Betty's own sense
of radical change of environment, which in our world
ordinarily means distance; and partly from mankind's
age-long mental habit of considering heaven "up" and
hell "down," and the heavenly messengers descending
to us on ladders or beams of light. After Betty had gone
to her Unobstructed Universe, she showed an amusing
impatience over this idea. She was talking, through
Joan, to a young woman she had known well in our
life. Something was said that indicated confusion in the

latter's mind. Betty stopped the discussion with the
abrupt question:
"What is your idea of where I am now, anyway?"
"Why," replied the young woman, rather vaguely,
"why, I just think of you as suspended somehow, in
space."
"/ am right here\
"
stated Betty vigorously. "There is
only one universe. There is no separate 'heaven.' My
world is your world plus"1
Even while here, she grew to understand that the
two phrases, "leaving the body" and "going far", were
only a manner of speaking, and that she could modify
them to advantage. Leaving the body became more a
matter of withdrawing — completely — attention from
the body. And the "journey" simply did not exist!
"It makes the world seem so small," she commented,
"when you reach out for people, and the space between
somehow shuts up like a telescope. I don't understand
that. Got to do some experimenting around. I don't see
how you can pull out and push in space like that. . . ."
The following long pause was obviously occupied
in the "experimenting around."
"Why, how astonishingly near that brings things!"
she burst out. "Isn't that astonishing! Why, isn't that
astonishing! Even the distance to the other conscious
ness is not a distance of space; it's a slowness or tor-

ation that makes it seem distant. It is so near when
you clear that intervening denseness which is not
space. . . .
"How can I tell this? Supposing I was in a dark room,
and then a bright light was turned on. The darkness
and the light occupy the same area, don't they? One
overcomes the other and reveals what the other did
not. Well, instead of being in the dark substance of
consciousness, I'm in the brighter revealing one. Den

"I can't pierce it further. I'm not big enough: it

This was enormously interesting to me at the time.
It is more so today, for now it appears as the first inkling
of the brilliant exposition of Space and Time Betty was
to give us, fifteen years later through Joan, in her book,
The Unobstructed Universe.
In the immediately subsequent sessions the concept
was further developed.

vestigation, "space is only an imaginary boundary, not
a definite reality. How curious it looks! There isn't

GATES BEYOND GATES
i.
That concept — the hereness rather than the thereness
—had at least the merit of relieving my own mind. I
had never quite liked the idea that Betty was being
taught to "leave her body" and go sky-hooting off into
unknown and distant spaces. But if leaving the body
meant, as it now seemed, merely a complete with
drawal of attention from the body, and a transfer of
being into a different center of the same consciousness,
why then that wasn't so bad. Nevertheless the new
field was "remote" in that, without such training as
Betty was receiving, we enter it consciously only
through the portals of death.
In that sense, at least, she was exploring a distant
world. Exploration of this new region was not merely
to satisfy curiosity: it had a definite purpose, concerned
as it was with universals.
"I am always afraid of being monkey-minded over
here," she told me. "There's so much to see and do."
Though the Invisibles described the purpose as "ex
pansion of consciousness," that appeared to have a
number of facets. She was to learn wisdom by precept
and actual experience: she was to establish headquar

ters in the higher consciousness from which to direct
her daily life: she was even to develop certain super
normal powers which are generally lumped under the
term "occult."
This last was an alluring side line. It had the fascina
tion of taking rabbits out of hats. Doubtless that is why
it is made the end and aim of many so-called systems of
development. The average of us, whether we believe
or wholly scoff, like to hear about Adepts and Masters
and White and Black Magicians and Witch Doctors
and Voodoo, but only as they are able to perform mys
tifying stunts. Well, in due time Betty learned to per
form stunts, when they were useful to the main objec
tive — but only then.
That was the point. Either she or the Invisibles — I
forget which — once stated the criterion for that sort
of thing. "When a means is made an end-in-itself, it at
once becomes a deterrent." In other words, conscious
attempts to develop psychic powers for their own
sakes are putting the cart before the horse, and are
quite likely dangerous in the long run. The safe road
is to seek higher consciousness, and then such psychic
powers as are useful to that end accompany, or follow
as a by-product. Betty did acquire psychic powers.
But she was never much interested in them, except as
faculties to be utilized in the world of higher conscious
ness as we utilize our faculties of sight and hearing in
our own world.

154 THE ROAD I KNOW
Nevertheless, as they were her faculties and for her
use, enough legitimate occasion in ordinary life hap
pened by to furnish material for many chapters of the
believe-it-or-not variety, were the telling of such our
program. For instance, as we have seen, she had been
taught very definitely how to leave her body, in the
occult sense. But that ability was for the purpose of
her explorations, and she confined her use of it to just
that purpose, except on a few rare and obviously legit
imate occasions. As when she reached across the con
tinent — three thousand miles — to the sick-room of a
relative. She reported to me how he was, she described
the room, who was in that room, and what they
were doing; details confirmed to the last item by
letter.
She also learned to partake of another's mind —
which is perhaps more accurate than saying she could
"read" another's thoughts; and — again on very rare
occasions — did so; but ordinarily her scruples would
not permit.
"It would be an invasion of privacy," said she.
Doing psychic work in the usual sense for others was
no part of her job; and this aspect, too, she declined.
However, because the circumstances made it seem to
her almost obligatory, she solved a mystery as to
whether murder or suicide, so convincingly that not
only did the widow receive a large sum of insurance,
but a rascally business associate was glad to disgorge.

Over the period of years such things happened
— not
often — but when they did they were of practical
value.
2.
For most of us, I think, such unique possibilities
would have held something of a lure. But Betty was
not much tempted. Her interest was too completely
centered in the exploration of her new world. And
this, even I could see, was a man-sized job.
Betty's attempts to describe that world were a con
stant struggle. This new region, it seemed, was so ut
terly novel as to be next to inexpressible. But appar
ently the reporting back was an essential part of her
program, perhaps for crystallization in her own mind,
perhaps for my benefit.
"I am trying hard to accustom myself, because I
dimly feel I must acquire for you an actual knowledge
of these fundamentals," she told me. "They must be
made living, vibrating intensifications of your con
sciousness, not just dead symbols of vaguely compre
hended verities. I must accomplish
it,
first in my own
exploratory fashion, then in its refinements and adap
tations—its mental concepts and its verbal monuments."

coveries.

times that it seems as though people must know I have

This was ordinarily her attitude. But once in a while

whisper:

She paused again, as if in contemplation.
"I feel so strongly this great vaulted life of limitless
health, vitality and possibility, surging, pulsing with

the pulse of a summer night. It is so alive, this vaulted

It has a richness we know nothing about — all the top-

And there's such abounding energy to it — such

For some moments she was still.
"My world!" she continued, with something like
reverence. "The intensity of it is almost like suffering,
it is so acute. I am roaming, almost despairing, hunting
for terms. It is life at the meridian — it casts no shadow.
It is life at its core. To translate it would wrench me
to pieces. I must keep quiet
"
As a dealer in words I thought she was doing very
well, and I said so. But she was dissatisfied. To her the
thing itself was so much more vivid than any possible
reflection of it.
"To try to tell of it," she disagreed tersely, "is like
trying to bottle sunshine. In ordinary terms it simply
does not convey itself."

To the very end Betty continued to find the higher
consciousness largely untranslatable. Necessarily,
therefore, she often resorted to symbolism. Much of
this was arresting and beautiful. I cannot here quote
adequately.2 But the following will serve as an example:
"I've entered the hinterland of consciousness," said
Betty. "Everything is radiance-filled and fresh and
eager-spirited, as on a pinnacle day of extreme youth
and extreme tiptoeness for life, more life. . . ."

She broke off, leaving me to wonder what was going
on.
"I'm playing a most amusing game," she explained
presently. "I'm busy collecting different phases of the
spell of this country. It is not a tellable thing, but I'll
see what is obtainable in word patterns. . . .
"All the words are too pompous," she continued.
"They are too ponderous for the playful, blissful thing
I'm doing. It is like the great, bosoming comfort of be

the water, only conscious of its caress when I move.
It so perfectly surrounds and accepts and sports with
me. I tear it up; I tear the water up to see it mend itself
so derisively, just laughing its bubbles at the futility of
my efforts. I am stroking the water as I swim in the

arms thrust out. Broken drops flash back. . . .

to combat this attitude. They were always encourag
ing her to loosen up; to make an amusing game of it.

speaking. "They only want to make it play. It keeps
the right balance
"Oh dear!
"
she begged. "I want to get it into some
thing tangible for Stewart. You've got to cast a mate
rial shadow for him. You've got to make it into some
thing like coin he can spend to get things with, or he
won't think it any good!
"
She paused a moment.
"I feel as though I had dived to a great depth to get
something for you," she told me, "and when I came up
and looked at it with your eyes, it was nothing but a
cockleshell."
As I look back I realize I must have been a great trial,
nevertheless I believe my insistences were useful. My
stubbornness gave Betty an anchor to windward; coun
teracted any danger of drifting. At least the Invisibles
were kind enough to tell me so.
Betty realized that for this period anyway, we must
have different points of view.
"I am emboldening myself," she told me one day,
after a long initial pause, "and it takes time. Funny
game! ... I have to embolden myself in order to acquire
an authoritative presentation of things. You see, we

passing back and forth from one type of comprehen

"My effort," she interrupted herself to explain, "is
always and always will be, to do the thing itself before
I can know about it."
Obviously many of Betty's experiences were sym
bolic shows arranged by the Invisibles. For example:
"I am carefully approaching something — a great
Presence." It was Betty speaking. "I want to see if I can
make out who he is and what he has to tell me. . . .
"Now I can't come any nearer to him, so I will just
have to listen carefully. Something is shaping vaguely,
as a mass comes to form on a potter's wheel. . . .
"He is showing me carefully guarded treasures. I

There is a mass of beauty in them, so curiously wrought

first primitive sensation of creative force which I
manufacture and maintain.
"It is the growth of this sensation of greater and
greater radius of superior force acting on the primal

"This is difficult," was Betty's rather puzzled com

against a curious kind of waiting for some acts of mine.
I see that clearly, but can't seem to make the effort.
"I feel as if my hands and feet were bound," said
she, "and yet I was told to make my first experiment

soon, so unprepared, as it were, into the stream of
workers in spiritual force. But then I realized I was

"I went back to my hook-up with the Source to see
what first clumsy thing I would do to utilize my pow
er," said she. "The first thing I wanted was affiliation,
a heart affiliation that abolished separateness. That
makes for strength. The second thing I wanted was to
make an impress of my convictions. It did not have to
be noisy or clamorous, but it did have to be steady and
motivating. How few make impressions: only the
quiet and the martyred."
She was supposed to do something. What?

thing. Do you want to know what I did? It is a sort of
foolish thing to tell; but the first thing I did was to
throw out all the warmth and happiness I could collect
and hurl forth. I decided I was going to have my own
circumambience that everybody would like to come
into. It would be like a glowing river in its unimpeded
progress, with song on the way, and sparkle And,
by Jove, I was going to see that it kept up its exuber
ance and dance and vitality and fling! I got enthusiastic
about
it,
and
I
worked terribly hard, until
I
found out,
after
I
had made
it,
that
I
carried myself along quite
gaily."
This met with approval, as
a
beginning.
"You realize how useless and futile you are; you try
hard and experiment until you acquire something with
which to work," said the Invisibles.
"This," said Betty with satisfaction, apparently de
scribing the state of consciousness to which this
brought her, "seems to be ahead in productivity of any
other surroundings I've had.
It
is
a
place where things
are done, and done efficiently. I've got all the release
and freedom of striding on hilltops and through spring-
swept days, and the feeling of superlative powers
within."
Apparently the method of the moment was to throw
her overboard, as one teaches
a
puppy to swim.

long silence, "plopped out

serenity. It was like a fire drill, a first aid course, what
to do in an emergency. I remembered the advice given
for the physical zero hours. Leave pain and puzzle
ment outside, they said, and creep to your quiet center.
Let your heart seek close proximity to the divine
spark, believing in its power to remagnetize you. Be
still. Let it work."
"This," interjected the Invisible, "is the same thing
as what we have called taking directly from the Source.
It supplies harmony fitted and prepared for instantane
ous use, with all the warmth necessary for the con
tinued life of that harmony in practical affairs."
"The chaotic din and discord continued around
me," Betty went on, "and I thought, 'I must fly to my
army of invisible friends. With them I must hastily
fling out worship, thankfulness for knowledge of su
perior weapons, claiming the reinforcement of them,
determined that the constructive forces would inform
my action.' Then I stepped out naturally into the bat
tle, and held on to my determination, and let it work.
A great pressure came against me, like the swift cur
rents we could barely stand against in crossing the
Alaskan rivers. A great pressure was on me, and I felt
my inadequacy: It was an emergency. What could I do
to maintain myself, and to act against the current, as it
were, like a power-ship against the tides? At once I re-
enforced myself with the strength of the army of in
visible friends we have been unifying. The pressure

was still there, but the crisis had passed, turned by su
perior strength.
"You see, our best weapons are really our invisible
alliances. That part must not be neglected, as it is our
present field of action. Action without the directing
power of the spirit runs to waste; and on the other hand
unrelated spiritual example seldom reproduces itself in
others."
She was feeling for a technique of application.
"I just break up and work hard and am uncomforta
ble," she told me, "and then I find I am raised up to a
superstate and in touch with something that I did not
have before. I see it vaguely and look back and tell you
about it. I don't just sit and read about it and see
it;
I
do
it,
whatever I'm at. That
is
why
I
work so hard and
keep quiet so long.

she broke off to complain. "But really

so cheerful,
so jolly and so loving and wise and warm-hearted. You
see,
it
isn't any question of going out and trying to be
good. There's
a
great danger in that, because we are
apt to lose the exuberance of our sinfulness; and that
is
taming, very very taming. What you miss, the way
I
am telling
it,
is
the exuberance."
"What's the matter with zest"?" suggested the In
visible. "You do not think of muscular 'exercise', for
instance, when you experience zest. You do not iron
yourself out into any newly acquired condition. Duty

does not drive you to it. Logic is left in storage. With a
full flow through you proceed to enjoy living. That is
spiritual action.
"Of course," they added, "you cannot go around
zesting things priggishly. That is not what is meant.
What we want to get into these teachings is naturalness,
not priggishness."
They recurred again and again, in many forms of
expression, to the assurance that they demanded of
Betty no great and noble tasks. Just living, said they,
ordinary daily living. Plenty of material to work on
there.
"Nothing is too small to work on with the tools of
eternal values," emphasized the Invisibles. "Take the
smallest things, little hourly experiences or situations
of a commonplace day, you can, by your concentra
tion of desire, transform them into a spiritual signifi
cance akin to a poem."
The Invisibles' word "poem" set Betty off up a by
path.
"Poetry is thought's most buoyant form, ready for
release into emotion," she said to me, with an air of
confiding something, "I am poetry now. It is the most
volatile form of human communication. I am beauty
running free, only shaped by the momentary effort to
reflect some particularization of life, instead of life it
self. Always it is shaping, and the limitations of form
are its pain, the ecstasy of its suffering.

"Have you ever thought of the visual body of a
poem?" she continued her apparently irrelevant fan

It floats on a page; it isn't anchored at all the corners.
"I do things so curiously," said Betty after a pause.
"I had to do some sordid scrubbing stuff; and then in

At the next session the job of giving expression to

"I know now what that phrase means; God is love.
It always sounded so straining and affected to me. I
don't like it yet; but that is my stupidity. At least I

She found it difficult to make an intelligent start in
the actual application. Apparently it was to be a repe
tition, in this field, of her gropings toward realization
in others. Again she must arrive at comprehension by
cut and try, by the actual doing. But in the doing she
found, as always, satisfactions by the way.
"It is a perfumed work," she told me, "like woodsy
smells and flowers and odors caught at rare moments.
When you lead people out into something they ap
prove of, like Nature, then you can work magic on
them."
This, I suggested, was poetic but inconclusive.
"Suppose," she countered, "you were set down
without equipment in a new world — a world of crea
tive power centered in the individual, What would
you do? Today I decided that, to succeed with this
power, first of all my fundamental outlook must be

She lapsed for a time into contemplation of some in
ner experience. I asked her what she was doing.
"I am going through the sensations of another per
son regarding this influence," she replied. "He is a per
son with an absorbing occupation, one that demands
all his working hours and energy — just caught in the
habit and fixture of days like that. I am that person.
That is the wall I am up against. I have to begin with
the tiniest little start of some kind and keep working
at it
"
She was silent for a while.
"Now then! I only had room in my mind for the
hopelessness of doing anything else with my days. . . .
This isn't me" she reminded, "it's somebody else. . . .
Then in a fertile-spirited moment a shred of vision
came to me, a tiny fleeting glimpse of a different kind
of living. Suddenly I saw a beautiful radiance, sensed
a better scheme; and because it was the real-thing in
spiration, because it met the fertile moment in me, it
didn't fade out like the worded inspiration in books.
It was persistent. A sort of breath of sweet spring
growth had come to me in a damp dark dungeon. I was
sprouted by it somehow

CHAPTER XVI
HABITUAL SPIRITUAL CONSCIOUSNESS
/.
It was curious and interesting to me to follow Betty's
own change of inner attitude toward the thing she was
doing. At the start she worked at it only during the
especially dedicated hour or so of formal "communica
tion." Her object was to get "messages." And her chief
reaction was of high adventure. But little by little she
shifted until her objective became no single concrete
thing at a specified time, but a continuous state of mind.
The Invisibles approved strongly of this change in
purpose; probably all along they had been working to
induce it. The "sessions," with myself attending, were
all right, and necessary and must be continued. But
they were now only a small part of Betty's job. Hers
was the proverbial "woman's work" in that it was never
done! She must practice, said the Invisibles, by herself.
Not in "psychics," or communicating, or any of the
rest of that; but in realizing — making real to herself —
this new-found inner state. Start first thing in the morn
ing, said they.
"The first business of each day," they told her,
"should be a recognition of the sun of your life — un
questioning and eager heartlifting acknowledgment of

the warm, loving, positive creative force of the uni
verse beyond your knowledge. Always give time to
purify and clothe fittingly your spirit to contemplate
the unknown great Causal Force operating through
each living thing. Unless you make a conscious exer
cise of this, conscious power is not yours throughout
the day."
And, they emphasized, that power throughout the
day must be conscious. Which, Betty acknowledged,
was a fine counsel of perfection, but as a practical mat
ter might be somewhat difficult. Highly desirable to
float through the hours on a high plane of serenity, but
how about telephone calls, and the cook with her lists,
and the arrival of the plumber, and
But that was not at all the idea. The Invisibles kept
at her, and finally managed to convince her.
"I see," she cried, "each day we must create for our
selves by this magic, call it what you please — tuning,
ordering — a dignified temple suitable for the habita
tion of our highest ideals. It is as though one made of
each separate day a beautiful little habitation in which
to live while the big temple of the lifetime is building.
There is retardment and confusion and discourage
ment in working out the greater scheme, unless the
little temple of each separate day is prepared as an in
spirational workroom. You know, workmen on big
buildings always have these little houses to work from,
but they are generally ugly."

Thereafter Betty never omitted these "early morn
ing ablutions," as she called them. Every morning she
retired for a half hour to her little sun-room, and no
body was permitted to interfere, not even the cook!
Occasionally travel or emergency might prevent. Nev
ertheless she would always manage to sit quiet, for at
least a few minutes, by herself.

This procedure was the first step toward establish
ment of what the Invisibles called "habitual spiritual
consciousness." Before long they insisted on another.
"A new field," she reported to me, "almost a
business-like field, establishing us in the substance of
reality. It has to be done or we'll go no further. . . .
Otherwise we would go with the drift of those who
just experiment or are content merely to be experi
mented on."
"That sounds like a threat," I commented. "Where
might we fall down?"
"A subtle dulling of accustomedness," replied the
Invisibles. "You must partake more constantly of the
vitality within reach. The accumulation of the details
of living reduce the power to a minimum."
There ensued a short pause.
"The single thing I can get hold of today," Betty
said at last, "is the drabness of our life. Why don't we

intensify it? It can be so breath-taking and so magically
progressive! There are not enough breathing-spaces,
like parks in a city; not enough moments of suscepti
bility to happiness and well-being; it's not punctuated;
it's all run together with the details of living. If we
could only make ourselves distribute more and more
frequently through our hours little breathing spaces
for the spirit to mount to consciousness of strength
and well-being, that would be the training we need in
the gradual acquisition of the happiness we won't take.
But we shut it out for all but the occasional hour, and
gradually the barrier thickens. We must keep it thin
and easily broken through. It's the frequency, not the
length of time, that does it. The more frequently, the
richer the personality. It is very difficult to fight the
tendency to hibernate in the world. Might just as well
do it now."
"Coagulation sets in," explained the Invisibles, "if
you don't keep broken up, if you dorft keep listening
at the higher pitch. Habituate yourself to it by utilizing
it constantly. . . ."
"This is confused, very much confused; but that's
it", put in Betty. "Can't find the clear way to put it. It
is very bothersome because first a thing seems audible
and then visible; but in reality it is all the same sense
over here, and you can't tell which is which when you
are separating them into word-senses. It's a reality of
feel. This is like having too many legs: it's a nuisance —

"But anyway," resumed the Invisibles, "all you've
got to remember is that when you make an effort you
generate a spark which helps you to enter intermittent

live. The oftener you do
it,
the more you get. When

"Hold on!

objected. "You are talking sparks now.
How can you hear sparks?

A few sessions later they brought the whole propo

giving us left-over time, and that is discouraging and
retrogressive. The every-day-every-hour attitude of
mind is so much more useful than any amount of peri
odical concentration!
"The main thing," continued the Invisibles, "is to
keep sweeping back and forth, so the dividing line be
tween the two worlds doesn't show. Commute all the
time: it's easy if you keep in practice. It's a definite
proposition — as definite as keeping outside your shell.
That shell is a very exact symbol. Once allow your
consciousness to slip into
it,
and you are at home and
familiar and comfortable, recognizing nothing tangible
but its commonplaces. Keep out of it! Train yourself
to be at home outside — to occupy, ordinarily, daily,
hourly, the highest consciousness you have achieved.
"A little reiteration will not hurt. It's the carrying-
through idea: habitual consciousness."

Betty did not acquire readily the ease of spirit she
ultimately gained. In spite of her new understanding
she sometimes found
it
difficult to cope with the com
mon distractions — travel, illness, house-guests, sheer
inertia — and most of all the trivial, accustomed rou
tine of daily living. Little things, often repeated, gain
a
momentum that
is
hard to break or check. But slowly
her compass swung toward the desired orientation.

from me, so much expanding before me. My eager im
pulse towards the things dimly sensed and greatly de
sired outruns my laboriously slow accomplishment.
My heavy self doesn't cooperate with my active spirit
ual being."
By this time Betty was pretty well at home in her
disassociated state. The first struggle for re-establish
ment was over, but the struggle in the tangible world
was just beginning.
"When I'm here, I enjoy myself," she announced
one day from that other consciousness. "But I am ex
alted above the confirmation of my powers. And I don't
know how to confirm them so they will be enduring.
It's as if someone had clothed me in most distinguished
estate, and I go in it rather ignobly conscious that it
does not belong to me — that I am not fit for it. And I
am ashamed not to deserve the beauty and dignity, in
stead of merely presenting the externals of it,"
"What's the trouble?" I asked. "Aren't you getting
along fast enough to suit you?"
"I still get only glimpses of the great power I talk
about and which I am struggling to comprehend," she
explained. "Of course, I enter the higher level with in
creasing frequency. There is no question about it:

fusing to overlap the two consciousnesses! Just now,
for instance, I was establishing myself comfortably— so
happy and busy and settled about myself. And then the
other focus of my consciousness showed up and said it
was intangible stuff. But it is not. . . . Dear me! It is
most annoying to have two focuses. What am I to do?
"
She worked on her problem.
"It is as if I were building something and had just es
tablished the corner of the top layer," she continued
presently. "And then I stopped there and went away,
and lived in an entirely different level! I've simply got
to make that my home, just as the lower level is now.
I've got to live in it and finish it out. There is no use
starting it unless you live in it. That just postpones your
destiny. That is the trouble with all of us: we keep our
ideals as lookout towers, and we seldom take the trou
ble to climb the stairs."
For a long interval Betty was silent. Then, in a puz
zled tone:
"Something is growing in me and has put out a shoot.
Maybe this physical world is only our roots. Maybe a
plant is terribly worried over its first shoot."
Another long pause.
"Now," she asserted suddenly, "instead of reaching
up, I have moved up. I am staying there. It works, too!
"
Again the pause.
"Ah, that's grand!" she cried at last, in triumph.

work with a well-ventilated mind, continually con

tions. I am not going to inhabit my lower level. I am

She broke off, and for some moments was still.
"I'm coming back," she ended. "Do you know, my
body seems like a troublesome child to me now. I drag

this state clearly from the periods of intense concen
tration you employ for training and development. In
especial exercises such as these, you are for a purpose
temporarily focusing on certain aspects of yourself.
During these periods you impose on the other aspects
your command that they sit still and do not bother you,
so to speak, until you have finished. You totally — or
as nearly so as possible — inhibit their activities. You
dismiss all reports from the subconscious; you clear
the conscious mind of thought.
"But when you invoke the higher consciousness in
the course of normal daily living you do not do this.
The bodily functions proceed with no less, and no
more, than your customary awareness of them. Your
brain-mind moves forward on its unintermitting stream
of thoughts and mental images. A bodily or mental
vacuum is unnatural and impossible. To check the flow
of these things is also unnatural, and allowable only for
a special purpose. Whole living implies the simultan
eous functioning of all the parts of yourself. Only the
sharp focus of your attention is shifted as desired to
that portion of your being where it is important that
it should function for the business of the moment.
"You must at all times remember, however, that it is
as serious a mistake to concentrate wholly in the super-
conscious as it is in the brain-mind or the body. To
each its balanced due of yourself; for that balancing is
the art of life."

THE HIGHER POWER
"I go to the Source," said Betty, summing up her own
practise. "In doing so I utilize my higher mind, aban
don myself to my intuitional, secure in its reality. I give
up looking at the Source externally. I try to enter into
its feeling of power and strength. After I do this a little
while, I am no longer an alien thing. I am somehow
attached to it sympathetically. Then I keep quiet,
very happily and expectantly, and its potentiality seeks
in me some little entrance, some crack or cranny
through which I receive some little bit. But that little
bit does its work. Eventually that bit must be recog
nized in my own medium for some definite purpose.
Now I am magnetized with
it;
one with it. But finally
I
have to come out on the borderline, and
I
take back
with me only just as much as will fit into the customary
mind's capacity for statement.
"Sometimes," she confessed, "I get sort of thwarted
and bored.
I
have to get over that."
She sought for the way to increase her capacity.
"I am trying to look at the Source and understand
it
for you," said she. "It's

ordinarily.
"All of us — our group — have had a hazy conception
that there are such things as spiritual forces that work
just as well as our physical forces do, only superlatively.
We all admit them, but still our hands and eyes and legs
and ears are of far more utility to us. The disembodied
quality I am now looking at is what would give us actual
possession of the working ability of these higher forces.
This quality is not much recognized. Actually it is just
the surmess of your belief in the existence of this great
er force. That is the principal thing to begin with.
"Take an example from natural physical forces. You
wouldn't have the nerve or the idiocy to try walking
on water; but you step out on ice with perfect confi
dence. In ordinary daily living you come to associate
your mind so naturally and pleasurably and habitually
with the forces which control our physical universe
that they grow measurably firm under the feet, as it
were. Take gravitation, which always works; the mag
netic attraction or the power of electricity when con- «
trol is established; the buoyancy of placement in water
— any of the natural laws that appeal to you. Our con
scious minds approve and abandon all test of them.

tice will make our spiritual bodies work. Anyway, it's
the first necessity we shall be faced with when we 'go
hence.' Everything we have been accustomed to will

fidence is itself a force: it is a superlative force."
"What we are stepping around," said the Invisibles,
"is to avoid the use of the word 'faith.' We don't want
to use it until we have freshened it. It's been made re
spectable by calling it suggestion: you all know the
power of that. Only this is its simon-pure reality, its
essence."
There was a short pause.

sumed, "only enough to begin with. I'll tell you how
I'm doing it.

Betty at last. "I know by the feeling when I get in a

exists in you, indefinitely developable, an engine of
power, dynamically creative, capable of impressing
and moulding your material world according as you
give out from your inner being its creative force. This
force is not primarily the mentally creative force, which
you understand perfectly. It
is,
as
it

a

principle of life.
It
comes, not from that mere agent of

Betty groped for definition in words — and as always
she was dissatisfied.

is that it's the biggest union of life, the nearest to har
mony, the most collected force. . . .
"Harmony is so poor a word! It isn't a bad word; it's
just a mistreated word. I want to give freshness to that
word. Now it's just a semi-religious, semi-musical term;
but really there is a rising tide of progress connected
with it. Well, in spite of its inadequacy it represents a
strong factor in this force that upholds, this tide of ex
tension. But it is not the thing itself — only a shred.
"The thing itself is not will-power, either; that's
only another aspect of
it;
just one more place where
we've touched
it
in comprehension. What
I
am trying
to get at
is
the whole of this force; not only the de

concentration, but the complete power of it."
"There

contracted and an expanded form
of everything," contributed the Invisibles. "Will
power
is
the contracted form of this higher thing. You
can step into
it
from will-power without contracting
if
you think of
it
more as desire-power. Will-power is
in spite of your desires."
One day Betty — more or less in desperation,

coiled from
it
at once. The phrase had been too much
knocked about by sentimentality.

sentiment, because pure feeling is the divine spark. It
is the intelligence of the heart, the secret of creative
magic. Pure feeling is a warrior quality. It is made of
the stuff that endures. Strong and true, it engages with
earth passions and comes through them unscathed. Still
I despair of setting down pure feeling."
But the Invisibles found the phrase acceptable
enough, for the time being, at least.
"Pure feeling," said they "cannot be apprehended by
the brain. You can, however, cultivate it by welcoming
its entrance into your heart region. Experiment, and
see how it softens all the cruel rigidities of life, how it
escapes all chains and shackles of maladjustments."
Betty paused long to consider, and perhaps to ex
periment.
"I made the most superhuman effort to rouse myself
to the possibilities I have been shown," she reported at
last. "And I struggled and struggled with increasing
difficulty until I remembered the secret of the heart-
solvent. Then a great, warm rushing sensation came
over me, and in the stimulation of it I longed unspeak
ably to be able to make the effort and do the work, to
assume the responsibilities pertaining to the distin
guished estate that has been loaned me. In this great
rush of vitality resulting from just the right combina
tion of life I actually sensed creative blood coursing
through me. And that gave me the feeling of the only
way to work toward permanent occupancy."

"Why not," suggested the Invisibles, "think of the
higher force as a compound of the essences of all the
qualities of all the forms of life and experience one en
counters? And then, in imagination, select and call
forth those particular essences one needs for the use
of any particular moment in life?
"That's a good game," said they. And Betty, with
her usual enthusiasm for games, pounced upon it at
once.
"If I am to work in essences," said she, "I must get
the tools of my craft. So I collect myself essences: the
energy of my waterfalls, the stability of my rock, the
time achievement of my trees — there is such inspira
tion in their achievement in time. I like their beauty of

growing old I I want that kind of garnered strength. I
want trees and waterfalls and big rocks. They are so
real in themselves. The realities of humans tire me —
their wars, murders, shortsightedness.
"Thus I collect essences. All I have to do is to walk
in my garden collecting and releasing essences — never
hoarding in the cloistered-garden sense. Essences are
everywhere to work with.

CHAPTER XVIII
THE SOURCE OF SUPPLY
We have now, you and I together in these pages,
travelled many miles" along the Road that Betty knew.
Through her eyes of the spirit we have seen much of
the landscape it traverses; and in her company we have
passed certain landmarks, and have risen to certain
heights from which we can see the highway going on
for eternity, as the Invisibles had once said. And some
how, though we cannot discern the end of the Road,
we are able to make out, through the mists, at least the
lay of the land through which Betty will continue her
journey.
What lies about us at this point? Aside from all the
details of instruction and the by-products of acquisi
tion, I think I should define as the kernel of her ac
complishment up to now, conscious contact, or tuning
in at will, with the Source.
What of this Source?
In extreme starkness of definition, it is the vital prin
ciple that is the basis of all manifestations and energies
that make up the universe. It is the underlying evolu
tionary power, force, life that makes things, and keeps
them in being, in development, and in functioning.
The highest expression of this force on earth indubita
bly is human consciousness. And so an extended defi

nitdon leads up to Consciousness as the one and only
reality. We sense this highest of reality, but not broken
into bits as is our own experience, but all-inclusive-and
all knowing. Some people name it God: some people
name it something else. That does not matter.
Now if Betty had stopped, on her road, at the mile
stone of mere contact, she would have found herself
in a numerous company. Mystic communion has been
often enough achieved to be generally recognized,
even if not widely practiced. But such mere contact
does not get you to the end of the journey. Betty's
next forward thrust was to be toward another mile
stone, not so well known.
The Source is the vital principle of which we must
partake for mere being. It is the origin, cause, basis of
existence. But merely to exist is not enough. Creation
must also function. To function it must have energy,
power. And that energy and power, certainly so far as
we are concerned, must be renewed as it exhausts itself
by use. That is an axiom we well know as applying
to, say, a gasoline engine. It has a fuel tank, which must
from time to time be refilled.
But now we are called upon to discover that renewal
is a universal need. The vast machine that is creation in
cosmos, that is the earth and all that in it
is,
that
is
our
selves, must have its power, and
it
must be renewed.
Otherwise all sits "numb, and dumb and unaware,"
awaiting the Word.

THE ROAD I KNOW 203
Ask any man what he seeks from life. Happiness, he
will reply. And of what substance is happiness? Why,
his first thought runs, bodily health and comfort and
efficiency, and a certain security of possessions. But
soon, even though he gains them in full measure, he
must conclude that these things are not happiness. His
discontents are not for things outside. His hunger is for
things within.
What does man really want, in the unstable world
of today? Mental peace, I think. But mental peace seems
to him out of reach in high inexpressibles, on which he
cannot put his finger. And yet, if he could analyze,
they are not so many. A few things would suffice — to
achieve his ambitions, and perhaps a little more; to
gain an inner assurance of a stability that is independent
of outward circumstance; above all to possess both the
faith and the feeling that there is a strength beyond his
own, and that he can command and utilize it.
There is that strength, Betty was assured. We do
tap it and utilize it. But ordinarily our tapping it is un
conscious, a mere prerequisite of any function at all.
We take from it only what the need of the moment
forces upon us, so to speak, and in consequence our
existence is niggardly and hampered.
So there is the Source, not only of being, but of
power — the Source of Supply.
Nobody would lead a niggardly and hampered exis
tence if he could help it. Well, he can help
it,

demonstrates. It is unnecessary. No man need be con
tent with only just enough to get by with. If he would
follow her Road he will discover that it is possible for
him to tap the Source of Supply as a conscious and in
tended act. And in so doing he will find that what he
can take from that Source of Supply is limited only by
his desire-power and the energy with which he is will
ing to back it! For the Source of Supply is unfailing
and inexhaustible. And sympathetic and understand
ing.
What is the practical value of this knowledge?
Where does one apply it in everyday living? Merely
to acquire it is not sufficient: one must accomplish.
How? The answer is engraved on Betty's next mile
stone.
At the point in her progress to which we have now
traced her Betty had entered fully into the occupation
and savor of her "private world" and its powers and
prerogatives. She had perfected her mystic commun
ion with the Source. She had learned how to tap the
Source of Supply. But now she perceived that she was
to be not the owner, but the agent. She must learn how
to be the agent. That was the next stretch of her Road
she must traverse.
From the Source of Supply, Betty was told, we can
get everything, unstinted, everything that is good for
us and that we have earned and deserve. But only pro
vided we know how to give it away after we get it\ —

CHAPTER XIX
THE GREAT SIMPLICITIES
i.
By nature Betty was a givey person. Indeed, I used to
joke that her endless generosities had forced me to be
come mean and avaricious just to keep us out of the
poorhouse. There was little need, therefore, for the
Invisibles to stress desire as the first rule in the disci
pline of outflow. Nonetheless outflow, as well as in
flow, must be motivated, they told us, by the wish-to
rather that the will-to. And Betty, the naturally gener
ous and free handed, responded with enthusiasm. "It's
so much more natural to give," she said, "than to take."
Not that there were no gropings and stumblings on
the way to her full understanding of the art of manag
ing the outflow of the Supply, now that she had learned
how to tap it. There were many puzzlements. But these
the Invisibles helped her to resolve by what they called
the Great Simplicities.
I shall not catalogue the Simplicities here in advance,
but rather call them to attention as they developed in
due course. It is best to picture Betty as reaching out
for them, feeling her path as she went — for that is how
it actually happened.

THE ROAD I KNOW 207
"There come certain times in one's evolution when
one completes a phase of development," Betty was
explaining the next stretch of road. "Instead of being
a freshman, one is a senior. I can always tell when I am
starting a new field of work, because I can turn around
so easily and look back at the old one so clearly. And
you can't turn around until you have pretty well fin
ished up a stage
"I wish I could get a good analogy for the sensation
of what I'm facing now. There's quite a change in the
feel of it — something like being made a pro instead of
an amateur."
Contributed the Invisibles: "The practice of the
higher consciousness, an active life regulated by it —
this is the final step in our present teachings. After ac
customing yourself to the universal mind, convincing
yourself of its desirability, then comes the still more
difficult practice of using it. It must be done in relation
to earth life, or it is not done at all. One must learn to
take the rough and tumble, the unsympathetic con
tacts, indifferent if not actually thwarting."
There was a pause while Betty digested this.
"Formerly," she acknowledged at last, "I brought
myself, by various symbols to stand under a spiritual
sun, as it were, passive and receptive. Now I must go
out actually on the earth to live to the full, to fail and
.fall, experiment, create a new environment

Invisibles. "That, however, is but an opening of the
gates. You must go through."
"Oh dear, I've been so busy getting this thing into
my consciousness," lamented Betty, "and now I've got
to be just as busy getting it out — and it's just as hard!
"
"Remember," reiterated the Invisibles, "the first
point — that the active life means constant inflowing""
and outflowing. You must never, never torget to be
constantly giving out."
Either Betty or myself — I forget which — wanted a
specific hint as to where to begin. Active where and
how?

slowly took their dictation, seemingly hanging on
every word.

So it was then that Betty mastered one of the Great
Simplicities — Circulation, as the Invisibles now and
then called
it,
meaning not merely the necessity for an
outgo equal to the intake. The outgiving must not be
intermittent. Circulation, not in spurts but rather as

Particularization was the name given by the Invisi
bles to another of the Great Simplicities.
"A rather ponderous bit of language," I suggested.
Betty chuckled, as though she too had found the
word amusing. But her amusement quickly passed.
There was a long pause.
"I must try to tell you," she said at last, "what I ex
perienced just now in being unable to utilize the love
force arouna me. I could not hold it condensed and
shape it in any form. I must explain this, because we've
got to understand it — the pain of taking shape,, the
anguish of particularization. I have no right to take"
more expansion. It would be like overfeeding, or
massed wealth — something damaging to me. I have

a higher life, but now I come willingly to suffer the

there is something more than that. If we stop there, it
is almost a stagnation. We have got to be continually

tylere outflow, it seemed, was not enough, however
sustained and steady. It must focus to definite ends; it
must particularize.
"Inspiration," said the Invisibles, "comes only in at
traction to some definite output, some definite produc
tion. It cannot come unless it has a container. Inspira
tion only fills what is prepared for it. It cannot be con
trolled otherwise. It is like electricity; it has to be
brought into a mechanism ready for it. The through
„, current must push something. In the same way the
higher consciousness is a wonderful driving force,
its nature is to dissipate unless it meets something that
, helps its particularization. The force wants to be as
sisted: it comes for that purpose. Remember that: it is
. a waiting,, undifferentiated force that ivavts to be dif
ferentiated. Your business is now to attach some

A very disturbing time had descended on Betty.
"Oh dear!" she cried. "What I don't know worries
me so much, and what I do know doesn't interest me!
Always, always this feeling of the vastness of what we
have to learn. Why sometimes I can glimpse down cen

"That's neither here nor there," she checked herself
sharply. "There's no excuse for being fuzzy!"
Promptly the fourth Great Simplicity came through.
Apparently "spirituality" can and sometimes does get
out of hand. It needs Regulation. So the fourth Sim
plicity was named.

All this preparation, as presented here, appears to
precede the actual experiences and experiments that
enabled Betty to real-ize, to make-it-so, to become
what she knew. But from the bald chronological stand
point these actual experiences had already long since
begun. However, bald chronology, as always, gives no
clear picture of process. I must, like the Invisibles, skip
about, selecting from the record, sketch what seems
necessary to the framework of effort and indicate the
tools Betty must use. One of the latter, of course, was
the care of the physical body. As a furtherance for
spiritual development the Invisibles had no use what
ever for the medieval idea, still persistent enough, of
the "mortification of the flesh."
"One thing to respect always," they protested any
such point of view, "is the physical body. If there is
flattening out and dulling of
it,
that comes about
through various misinterpretations of the relations be
tween the spiritual and the physical. The growth in
refinement of the inner being may interpret itself into

and appetites of all kinds. Don't make hard and fast

cessity to elaborate this. It is a hint that you can accept
or reject as you please."
The idea met no opposition from Betty. Zest of en
joyment in all that the world had to offer had always
been characteristic of her.
"Iwant common ordinary earth brute force!" she
declared. "It's my contribution, my share. Spirituality
on earth is impotent without it. It is the functioning
body of the spirit. They concentrate me on the spirit-
ual until I have a certain amount, and then I have to
produce the force to make it function. If I mereiy kept

Fine! the Invisibles echoed. But, they rather hu
morously anti-climaxed Betty's abandon, mere physi
cal brute force is not quite it. There is no reason why
one should not "be his age," no reason to pretend a

CHAPTER XX
THE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE
i.
The Invisibles never appeared concerned about any
difficulties Betty was having. It always seemed to me
that they watched her experiments and struggles much
as a benign adult watches a baby trying to find out how
to fit a peg into a hole. They supplied the peg and the
board with the hole in
it,
and occasionally they dropped
a
hint on how to get them together, but that was all.
Betty was at
a
phase of development which the In
visibles ironically called "the tinhorn-rattle-whistle
stage of children playing games." But they hastened to
add: "The games of children are among their best
means of learning. Grown-ups do not play with toys;
but taking away
a
child's toy does not make him
a
grown-up."
Apparently this idea gave Betty pause for thought.
"Over here," she had to agree, rather ruefully, "I
am always saying. 'Let's see
if
I
can do it! Let me do it!
'
as
a
child says."
"All right, here comes opposition," said the Invisi
bles. "Get ready! What to do?"
"I must gird myself joyously, like
a
game." Betty

rose to the suggestion. "Well, it's my turn! A hard ball
is coming! On your toes!
"
"Using the higher force," said they, "actually is like
trying to putt a golf ball down, or to hit a bull's-eye.
You have a certain power, and you try to work
it;
and
you figure why you failed, and you try again
— just
like your sports over there."
Of
a
cold fact
it
was like our sports over here, Betty
told me, later in her normal person. Especially that
dratted game of golf, she added. Betty had wonderful
command of her body — as witness that stunt of stand
ing on her head for long periods — but golf always ex
asperated her. She brought back from the links an ex
cellent definition — "You know,
I
can play this game
a
great deal better than
I
am — but
I
never do!
" Now, in
her flounderings in search of the smooth application to
actual life of her inner attainments, she was puzzled.
Finally the Invisibles threw her
a
line.
"You are forgetting to work in the nature of the
substance," said they.

The nature of the substance — here was
a
new phrase
to add to the many catchwords the Invisibles had pre
sented us. The inference was fairly clear, but what ex
actly did they mean?

do it with sulphuric acid, does he? — I must condense
and epitomize.— He knows better. It is not gold's nature
to respond to sulphuric acid. If an artist wants to ex
press pure form, he does it in clay or marble or wood,
he doesn't use paint. If he wants to express color and
atmosphere and that sort of thing he uses a canvas; he
does not daub up a statue, even if the Greeks did do
it,
or paste false whiskers on
a
portrait. Not
if
he
is
a
good
artist. And what would you think of
a
mechanic who
built
a
machine out of wood instead of metal? Or
a
schoolmaster who tried to talk calculus to the kinder
garten?
Now, the Invisibles advised Betty, extend that to
what you are trying to do —
I
am still condensing
a
mass
of record. What are you working on? The world —
people, individuals. You are trying to give them some
thing, of yourself, aren't you? The trouble is that you
are trying to give them all the same thing in the same
way. You don't expect the same thing from each of
them, do you? We do not want or find the same things
in different people. What do you want of your friends,
they finally challenged.
"Why," reflected Betty, "in some
I
want the warmth
of uncritical affection, unquestioned acceptance in
spite of surface imperfections. In others
I
want the
light touch of humor and good fellowship playing
lambent over our companionship. Still others help me
to touch my highest point of mind and soul reaches."

"And each of them wants something different from
you," supplemented the Invisibles. "The art of living
is to find out what you have for each other. A really
skilled worker cherishes the character of the materials
he works with, even to the point of utilizing a knot
hole for decoration. He works in the nature of the sub
stance."
And, they added, it is rather naive to expect smooth
sailing and cordial acceptance always.
"If you generate a force, it must meet opposition."
Betty was beginning to see the point. "That's what I'm
working on today. I go at it with a certain interest and
appetite in trying it out; a humorous acceptance of a
challenge with myself."
That opposition, said the Invisibles, is itself a sub
stance, with a nature of its own, that must be worked
in.
"The first thing you must learn," they added, "is to
accept opposition so in its entirety, so completely, that
not one speck of attention is ever wasted on
it,
except
for the intellectual appraisement of its strength and
the planning for control of its effect."
"I see," said Betty, "you do not say, 'Isn't
it
hateful
I've got this? Isn't
it
disgusting that this happened!'
You know that,

someone goes at you to overwhelm
you with something,

"The best course," elaborated the Invisibles, "is al
ways to reduce your aims to their essentials, and then
seek the cooperation of your material, however imper
fect. Nor will you find this too difficult to accomplish—
provided you keep as your chief aim the determina
tion to proceed with the least friction and the most
skill and sympathy, in the sense of an artist's sympathy
with his work and material."
"I needed that." Betty was appreciative. "You see,
for a moment I was a little sad and puzzled about the
uselessness of trying to bring a bit of real spirituality
into ordinary life. The exquisite amount of devotion
required to accomplish
it,
the creation of all the heart
energy and absorption in
it,
in order to make
it

to do, and people's reactions to

"It's a sort of idea of little shadings of ability to pick
up from the human scrap heap and sense the bits of
quality there. I find it a little hard — let it go," saiii
Betty.
"My first translation of my experience," Betty tried
to retrace the steps that had led her to this point, "was
that I was not to reach restlessly and objectively hither
and thither, but was to sit at home in myself and sense
that self to the depth of my capacity of heart intelli
gence and comprehension. But that was not adequate:
it is too limited.
"My next reaction to it was that through persistent
practice I had become used to thinking of myself as
vigorously centered in a point of power, capable of
action on inferior substance. And that inferior sub
stance is inferior because it has no free will to refuse
my vigorous action, any more than metal can refuse
to accept warmth when placed near the fire.
"But that was inadequate, too. Both those concepts
were too limited to convey the scope of spiritual action.
They are still molded by brain limitations; and yet both
have necessary steps of truth embodied in them. The
thing they lack is the universality of spiritual con
sciousness."

It is the wth degree of humanitarianism. It is respect for

KINSHIP
/.
Of course, the Invisibles had told Betty all along, she
was going to meet obstructions, throughout life. There
is a necessary resistance, they indicated. How else can
one rise? How else does an airplane rise, save through
the resistance of the air?
"After all," said they, "the time to practise anything
enduring is in the times of stress. . . ."
And, they added drily, she would find no dearth of
stress points. That is life; and life, in last analysis, is
people, just people. All the rest — the material com
forts, the material securities, the material necessities —
are met by the ingenuities of the mind and the energies
of the body, and what they assure is bare existence. But
it is in one's dealings with people, one's relations with
people, one's gifts to and from people, that one meets
the deeper resistance by which one's consciousness may
rise. That is life; and that is the nature of its substance.
I think they were warning Betty not to expect every
thing to be all sweetness and light and brotherhood of
man merely because she had come to understand the
nature of her substance. Or perhaps not. They must
have known Betty pretty well by now, and have been

into details, she had been enmeshed from childhood
with a singularly complete array of self-centered and
exacting neurasthenics, encroaching and" demanding
personalities with whom she had to cope; nor did her
marriage free her from them entirely. The Invisibles
classed them as "unreceptives," which seemed to me a
masterpiece of understatement. If I had been consulted,
I should have said that Betty needed no instruction on
how to get along with people, prickly or otherwise. It
is a literal fact that in the thirty-six years of our life to
gether I never knew her to quarrel, with anybody; not
even with me! I am certain this is no fatuous recon
struction because, occasionally for the fun of
it,
I
would try to prod her into
a
fight, and never succeeded.
Oh, she could be firm enough, as many — again includ
ing myself — found out, but in some mysterious and
Bettyish fashion she managed
it
without battle or in
dignation.
Be that as
it
may, the Invisibles and Betty embarked
on
a
statement of principles concerning conflict.
2.
"First of all," the Invisibles began, apropos of "un-
receptive" people, "you must protect yourself from
getting in their zone of action. You must first insulate
yourself. Insulation

not unsympathetic!

precaution the doctor takes against infection. So in
sulation is not isolation.
"Next," they advised, "keep yourself whole. The
strategy of war is to divide the enemy. Recognize in
stantly when you are being divided. Laugh a good
strong laugh, and rush forward. At the moment of
unity surge onward in spite of obstructions. Whenever
provoking things happen, look on yourself as in danger
of being the vanquished instead of the victor, the cap
tured instead of the captor. Each time you score, it is
a definite count; it is not erased. It is like acquiring
something; makes what you are doing easier. It is a
great help each time you hold fast and don't get cap
tured.
"Do not start out expecting to be flattered by spec
tacular results. Just plan to keep going for the satis
faction of occupying your place in the greater scheme.
There will always be moments of full realization, the
blooming and fruition natural to all life. That also will
come to you in its turn. It is not all strain and effort.
"Do not," they continued, "be discouraged even
when failure turns into something like actual defeat.
This is fun, you know, like gardening or healing or
painting a picture or any other creative satisfaction.
You decide, as a master should, how things should be,
and you make them so. You dominate your materials,

to defeat. When you look at the defeat side it is like
compound interest. The next time you will have to
overcome this time, and the failure that went before,
and the one before that. . . .
"And finally," they completed their list, "watch
your fore-determinations. Bad days must not be bad
before they begin. Put your consciousness on the high
er level, before you start out every day. You need more
preparedness for yourself. That is your job. Particu

just hazy. Work it over carefully, as you would an
architect's blueprint. That is vitalized thinking. It's
different, a creative thinking. There's substance to it.
It is really a higher form of thought."
"I do try to work it," said Betty. "I know the law,
but — oh dear, it's so unpopular! Everybody thinks it's
mushy. They don't know what I'm doing."
"These points are the important ones," summed up
the Invisibles, "the robustness of your intent, and the
temporary quality of seeming defeat. Remember we
are concerning ourselves with the laws of a higher
force which must, eventually, overcome things potent
only in their own generation and time."
"All right," agreed Betty. "Every time I feel an

danger of capture by inferior force. Instead of cutting
myself off from my reinforcements, I'll try to utilize

"In your relations to people," said the Invisibles, "it

dignity and reserve and depth to the real thing. It is

Kinship proved to be a key word.
"U, S, us; N, E, double S, ness: Us-ness," the In

"There is no such word," she commented, "but that
is what they say. . . . Anyhow, I can't separate myself
into a hard-shelled detached unit any more.
"Apparently I'm made up of fundamentals which
every created thing shares to a greater or lesser degree.
Therefore I'm sympathetically connected with, and

of it. ... I can't say it very well; but it's a very nice

people all around me, acting chemically on each other
— just like chemical action, only it is spiritual. We
laugh at the idea of auras, but they are quite real in a
way. You go near a fire, and that has an aura; so has ice.
Only with people it seems quite a tangible thing. It ex
tends just a certain radius around. When people ap
proach within that radius their auras intermingle, and
at once chemical action begins."
She was silent so long I finally asked what she was
doing.
"I am keeping quiet," she replied, "just to see what
belongs to us all in common. It is a strange companion

you, it is the j oiliest kind of companionship. None of
the little superficial differences matters at alL It is very
funny: I like to laugh, and yet it would sound inane
were I to tell you that just laughing, for itself alone,
without any specified joke, is a nice kind of inter
mingling.
"It's a good deal like having lots of relatives," Betty
continued after a pause. "That's the heavy side of it!
But the nice side of it is that you can go around feeling
relationship with all the beautiful things in the world.
You can call out to each other. That's much better than

She stopped short, struck with a new and splendid
idea.
"I wonder," she speculated doubtfully, "if I could
be an earthquake."
The thought of Betty as an earthquake was too much
for me; I shouted aloud. She joined my laughter, but
half-heartedly.
"I'd have to work my way up to that," she conceded.
She waved her extended hand, now here, now there.
"Anyway, it's like waving to somebody, or letting
him go by with no recognition at all. I want to go
around just greeting things!
"The simplest expression I can reduce it to is in the
word reciprocity," she decided. "That makes an actual
thing, like an electric current. I must have very simple
things like that, so they will stay in my everyday
mind."

"Never mind how simplified your consciousness
may become," the Invisibles told her, "nor how clear
your aim or your comprehension of what you are after,
nor how devoutly you may follow
it,
it
does not work
unless you have sympathetic comprehension of the
inter-relation."
"I am almost afraid to try to put the relationship into
words," said Betty, "and yet
I
must struggle with it."
She attacked the problem of expression from many
angles. "The great ocean connecting all islands and
continents — all the parceled-off objective things, of
however great magnitude, are but the islands and con
tinents among and around which flows the great car
rier," was one effort. But that did not work; for, said
she, the universal relationship not only flows around,

it's the merging of the substance possessed by all of
them, which, kept uppermost, produces the magic."
"This is very advanced teaching," warned the In
visibles. "We are not sure that it is wise to precipitate
it,
but we'll sketch its meaning. Very briefly and crude
ly,
it
is
to this effect:
"The undeveloped being lives in isolation of con

is,

his full consciousness concentrated at any point he de
sires. He assumes kinship with other consciousnesses as
poignantly as with his own."
"It
is
just like the radio," contributed Betty. "You
pick out the right wave length and travel on it."
"This sympathetic assumption of kinship," contin
ued the Invisibles, "empowers him with the attributes
of the higher consciousness. And one result of this

"It may not sound like much at first," said Betty,
"but think of the stupendous power of this faculty
when one actually grows into full possession of it. One
no longer occupies a one-pointed position. One's heart

"The greater entity," or, as the Invisibles put it at
times, Kinship, is the wave length to which one tunes
in order to really communicate with fellow beings.
And with that came, to us both, a great illumination.
For the most part the aim of Betty's first training had

peering into the different element of an aquarium. That
is the first process.
"Perhaps," they continued, "you will understand
this better if you think of it as just like any of your
other closer contacts. Take friendship, for example:
you approach your real friends with exactly the same
process of lightening pressures, of warmth in each
other's atmospheres, of getting directly in touch with
the intimate sides of them which are less recognized
by the world in general.

Recorded sessions of formal instruction, as such, prac
tically ceased with 1934. This ended fifteen years of
rigorous schooling. Apparently Betty's "outfit for
eternity," as she had once called
it,
was complete. She
had come into possessions, and she had gained con
scious use of them. That use appeared to boil down to
the ability to communicate with her fellow beings, vis
ible or invisible, here in our obstructed aspect of the
universe, or elsewhere in the unobstructed.
One thing more, however, remained to be brought
to the forefront of her consciousness; and that one
thing was in the line of attainment rather than of in
struction. Betty had not only learned something, she
had become something. And what she had become pos
sessed its own power of action, by the very nature of
its own substance. This was the last concept Betty-

world very dark — black. Here and there are spots of
glow or phosphorescence from the more developed
among us
"Now I am taking the point of view of a very highly
developed person on this side, one of the really great
Radiant Ones. If I were such a one, and wanted to help
somebody who showed this phosphorescent glow in
the darkness, how would I go about it? Why, I think
I would just come close and contemplate him, and so
bring the effect of my radiation on him. And what
would be the result of that?
"First of all, it would burn away or melt away the
external dull crust, exposing the core of his reality. And
that core would then reflect back. It would not glow
of itself, but it could now reflect the light of my radia
tion, and thus becoming visible to the man — make him
visible to himself.
"Do you see? It was all dark to him before, but now
he can see himself because of this reflected light, and
can perceive his needs and lacks and all that. And then
while the glow is on him, and only then, he can write
to himself about
it,
or talk to himself about
it,
in detail
— just what he needs. But all
/
have done
is
to bring my
radiation to him."

246 THE ROAD I KNOW
How was she to make the application to creative liv
ing? She went deep into an experimental silence.
"You remember," she was ready to report to me at
last, "that intensifying of your out-going impulses?
Well, the exercise I've been doing is like that, only it
is no longer in a straight-line channel, as it were. I am

Betty resumed almost breathlessly:
"I am gaining strength," she told me, "almost beyond
my ability to contain I lead a dance, I fling, I spread
warmth, I rush on, incandescent with life! Just let me
travel on in this glowing way for a while. . . ."
An interval followed.
"I am going through a change," Betty explained at
last, "a curious radiating, convexing and pouring out
from myself, as definite as though I'd been turned in
side out .
"Why! When you're arranged in that old concave
shape, you present no surface of participation in life!
You are an alien shape, just a dormant seed-encasement
of life! I don't want to be that way again, ever, just
concavely containing my little bit. It is all right, but it
is ungerminated."
Another pause.
"Take something exhilarating," Betty continued,
"take a salt-sea-washed body and the cool sweet union
of it with the great fresh element. Keep going out, out,
out beyond the mere exhilaration. You have turned the

ation. . . ."
Betty's enthusiasm became breathless.
"No words exist which can exactly express or con
vey this inner flame," the Invisibles encouraged her.
"It is one of the most silently apparent of possessions.
It makes its way without words or exhibition. It travels
from heart to heart in its own channels of expression
and exchange. And you always sense
it,
even
if
you do
not acknowledge itwith anything better than mental
sophistication, as toward something simple folk and
peasants have. For
it
is
a
unique and unmistakable thing,
this rare, luminous, stimulating, kindly radiation of one
who conducts, even though unconsciously, the cur
rent of universal force."
Her elation ebbed.
"I don't quite understand that — too big for me.
I
have the feeling of it:
I
know what
it
feels like to mani
fest in various forms of life. But
I
can work only in the
emotional desire of it."
The Invisibles warned her against fostering the idea
of an ebb. This radiation,
it
seemed, was the one thing
that did not work in alternate rhythm of activity and
rest.
"Remember this well," said they, "radiance should
not wax and wane in power depending on the earth's
recognition of it.

not someone sees the sun shining on it. It is his own self-
-of-self, his own bit of frequency that he alone can
manipulate. Therein only is happiness secure. The
control of destiny is in a steady maintenance of a course
satisfactory to your highest apex of perception. Radi
ance is the reward of this permanence of heart."
"Pretty soon," said Betty, "I'll start out and radiate
more strongly, pulse myself along. I feel like a baby
that must wonder how people move around so fast and
surely. I wonder how they dare do it. Radiation in
creases my surface." She added, "You are tremendous
ly responsible for your radius. That is what we are
judged by."
"Each person's deeds," said the Invisibles, "float, as it
were, in a certain atmosphere created by himself. This
fostering atmosphere is not sufficiently understood.
"We recognize and acknowledge things almost as
intangible, such as the chemical effect of the sun's ray's
on plants, the warmth and other conditions indispensa
ble to growth. The plant survives or perishes according
as the climate is suitable to its needs and character. The
warmth of the human heart associated with directing
power, discriminating intelligence — it is variously
named — makes this humanly fostering climate. It is
not understood as a parallel to the climatic condition
with plants. It must be. As soon as it is so understood,
it is going to fall in the category of things cultivated
as essential to life."

25O THE ROAD I KNOW
"This atmosphere we radiate —"
contributed Betty,
— "I don't know how else to say it — I see in it the
potency of the Djinn to the bottle — a Djinn which is
released by expansion of the heart. The moment you
take the trouble to acquaint yourself with your own
heart, to exercise it and extend its perceptions, then
you've begun to release your powerful Djinn — radia
tion. I luxuriate in
it;
but this luxuriating
is
the sort that
goes out and can be picked up by others.
It
is
not
a
selfly thing. — There
is
a
difference: selfish
is
stern and
haughty; selfly
is
merely limited
"It
is
fun to be alive enough to throw out sparks this
way," she cried enthusiastically. "Some people are
sufficiently inflammable to get the spark: on others
it
just sizzles and goes out because of the sogginess of
them. ...
I
wish
I
could describe what I'm doing. . .
."
She broke her exultation with
a
sudden complaint.
"Sometimes when
I
am happy, working this way in
heart substances, head substances keep getting in the
way, analyzing me as an introspective fool." She
paused, then went on with confidence. "But
Iknow
they are wrong.
I
see their inferiority and limitations
in span. They are all right — for their job. But the heart
substances are more powerful, more enduring."
"The thing
is
so fundamental," the Invisible en
dorsed this, "that its reality can only be felt, and not
contained in written words.
It
is
akin to light and heat
and energy, which are first and manifest second. The

interest with which one pursues a pet hobby comes
nearer to the radiation idea than any other, magnetical
ly attracting to you everything along the line, giving
and receiving with ease and pleasure. Love, humor, in
terested creation of the kind one does pleasurably in
one's avocations — every unobstructed channel of daily
life endowed with ease and richness of output: all these
are akin."
But Betty had passed her momentary depression.
"I feel so powerful!" she cried. "I'm so powerful
and sure, so absorbing of everything around me. And
yet I'm not just a fungus-growth absorbing. I'm oc
cupying more life: that's what I'm doing! That's a nice
idea, but I can't help thinking how funny it is for me
— Tm so piffling!
"
"Radiation is penetrative to a degree unknown to
denser matter," stated the Invisibles further, extending
Betty's lawn sprinkler concept. "Roughly speaking,
for visualization purposes, its action is not confined to
a direct line, but is also encircling. In other words, when
this force is sent out forward to an object, it is also re
ceived abeam and astern, above and below.
"And as it is extraordinarily penetrative and encir
cling, so it is also, paradoxically, extremely personal;
more so than any earthly possession, for its very exis
tence depends upon yourself — your inner, not your
nervously controlled self. It is the most individualistic
possession imaginable, as well as the most universal.

"Germinated spirituality is radioactive," they added.
"That is what makes the difference between the culti
vation and expansion of
it,
and when
it
is
merely po
tentially or rather dormantly motivating in you.
It
is
what gauges personality, the radius of
a
human being's
life influence.
"Think about this happily, without effort of any
kind. Strain will never accomplish anything but defeat.
If
radiation were anything but illumination in rapture,
it
would not be radiation."

"Listen!" breathed Betty.
Down in the canon, outside our window,
a
wood
thrush was singing, repeating over and over again his
liquid musical phrases.
"That
is
what
I
mean!" she cried. "That bird! His
very best — but plus his response." She puzzled
a
long
time over some instruction or explanation that was ob
viously being conveyed to her. "Oh,
I
see!" she ex
claimed at last — the thrush was continuing to sing —
"He
is
still doing
it
because he isn't filled up yet. You
see, he fills up magnetically, by giving out. That
is
the
way creatures get their life force, — the frog croaks,
and gets his that way. People get some when they laugh
or sing together."
She contemplated this for some time.

"I used to think I was reaching toward some distant
and occult sort of sense," she ventured. "Now I find
I'm just making thinner and thinner my walls in order
to blend myself with forces right at hand; forces that
all the plants and beasts possess."
"Until there is worship in the heart," this from the
Invisibles, "a development of intense perception of
something vastly superior to the sovereignty of the
brain, until there is the recognition of your sun — until
that is activating, all else is but an intellectual concept.
Unless that warmth is within you, a living flame ever
ready for action, it will be better for you to wait with
out the gate."
"Before I start anything," promised Betty, "I'll drop
my consciousness into place as a link between the pur
pose I do not understand and the little act of which I
am master. It is the consciousness of the hook-up and
the practice of it that makes it work, lets in the power.
It is just a workaday, natural action — my two hands
directed by my spirit. I'll just say to the unknown Pur
pose, 'I am ready when you are,' and keep a steady con
fidence in the purpose at hand, and it will grow in ripe
ness better than I could plan."
A silence.
"We are making a great road over which a noble
traveller approaches," said Betty.
