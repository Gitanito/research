  		              		Experience Description   

    When I was 18 years old, I hung myself. I was only testing the strength of my 'electrical cord noose,' but as soon as I did, it was as if I had jumped instead.  I didn't experience or don't remember the 'hanging and dying' part.

   I do remember that as soon I died, it was like I was in a timeless, distorted reality where the entire experience happened at that point. I felt like I'd been in super slow motion forever without  even a second passing and yet, happening all at once. 
  
  I've only told this to my wife, mother, and father. I'll probably get  told I should've kept it that way, but it's the honest truth.
  
   As soon as the experience started and I was 'dead', I knew it. Four shadows  grabbed me as I  thought they were  dragging me to hell. I prayed a word or two to GOD and the shadows disappeared.  I was a conscious dead person. I could see my body hanging. 
  
  Time seemed to return to normal, but I still had a feeling coursing through me that I don't expect to feel  until I die again. I turned and went towards the house where my mom was alone and sleeping. As I went to step up the front steps, my foot went through it and touched the ground. I  panicked and then resigned that I was dead.  I walked through the steps and through the house, literally. The floor is about waist-high on me because the house was set up high. I stood at the foot of my Mom's bed telling her that I was sorry about being  dead. Then it was like time stopped, twisted around and bent backwards. 

   All of a sudden, I'm on the ground coughing, with my mom crying while wiping my face with a wet cloth. I was alive! Every blood vessel in each eye had popped.  I looked like a demon. But I was alive and back in my body. My mom was only 4' 8&quot;  and didn't weigh much over a 100lbs, yet she was able to pick up my 155 lb body and remove the cord. I'm ashamed of trying to commit suicide.

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        Normal consciousness and alertness.
