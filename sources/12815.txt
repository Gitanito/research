  		              		Experience Description   

    I was trying to get home,  running late for curfew, and driving home on county roads late at night. It had been raining, so the roads were slippery and it was extremely foggy. A car was tailgating me and it made me nervous. So, I sped up and kept speeding up. I still felt like the car was following too closely. On an S- turn, I felt the back end of the car coming up around.  I had just had a  driver's training course that taught me exactly how to correct this. 

Yet, before I could act,  I heard  a powerful  voice and felt like  I didn't  have a choice in what to do.  At the same time, I also had a most peaceful sense of surrender come over me. The voice told me, 'Take your hands off the wheel.' Time slowed down as the back end of the car came around. It felt like I was up above and watching the car.  In slow motion, the back end of the car came around and shot across the road. The back end crashed into a hydro-pole. 

The next moment, I awoke to find that  the car was entirely crunched up around the pole. The pole had torn through the entire car and was now beside me. The entire car was totaled with the exception of my little square driver's seat. I was completely unscratched. The rest is hazy, how I got out, how the ambulance and fire truck came.  I remember smelling gas everywhere. A woman approached me but there was never a sign of the car behind me or  if it even existed.
