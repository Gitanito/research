  		              		Experience Description   

    I was driving home in the snow and in the dark.  I came to a fork in the road and started to veer to the right and immediately realized I should veer to the left instead. So, I quickly slammed on the brakes and turned the steering wheel to the left.  I lost control of the car as it started sliding in the snow.  I was unable to stop the car or get it to turn once it started sliding. 

   As the car slid toward a guard rail, I noticed that I was observing everything in slow motion  from above and behind my body.  I could see the back of my right shoulder and the blouse I was wearing.  I was completely at peace during this time. I had many thoughts despite  what I was seeing was in slow motion.  I knew I  had to let the car stop on it's own.  The thoughts going through my mind were, 'Wow, everything is in slow motion; wow, that's me I am looking at in the front seat; I am unusually peaceful right now; I probably shouldn't have veered to the left and hit the brakes in the snow.  So the left side of my card hit the guard rail and my mirror was snapped off and dangling and the tires came of the rims of my tires because my car had moved side ways when I lost control.' 

    As soon as the car stopped, I got out of the car. My soul was back in my body.  I never heard a pop or any kind of noise when my soul left and re-entered my body.  I wasn't hurt at all and was extremely calm when I got out of my car.  I figure I was so calm because my soul had left my body until the car stopped.  A car drove up beside me to help me and the couple in the car was more upset than I was.
