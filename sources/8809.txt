  		              		Experience Description   

    As I was slipping out of consciousness, it was as if a curtain of light were descending.   

   I remember how surreal it was to realize how dark our world generally is. I'm not sure how to describe this, but I could see the world from above—and it was as if a veil had been lifted that made everything very clear and vivid.  I rose up out of the darkness of the world and ascended into a very peaceful, painless, and uplifting reality. There were others there whom I could not see, but I did feel their presence. I could see where I was going to have to go next, but heard a voice in my mind telling me it was not time yet.   

  Suddenly, I was back in this world and noticed how really painful it was. I felt very angry they brought me back. Then one of the nurses reminded me that I will soon have a baby who will need me.

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Surgery-related.       Life threatening event, but not clinical death.   I was giving birth to my child.  It was an emergency C-section during to breech presentation and pre-eclampsia.  When the Anesthesiologist injected the epidural, she accidentally put it into a vein.  I remember seeing my blood pressure monitor read 40/20 and I knew it was over before I slipped out of consciousness.  
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  I saw and heard what everyone in the room was doing.  The anesthesiologist grabbing the reversal and pressor medication.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it.  [Medical notes: "A vasopressor agent or pressor, is any antihypotensive medication that tends to raise reduced blood pressure." and  "Reversal agents are defined as any drug used to reverse the effects of certain medications." Slightly word order alteration in online information sources: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and https://physionet.org]  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   It was as if everything was known and that was normal.  
  
At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         Probably at the point I was slipping off.  I was aware of everything going on in the room and even what my physical status was.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     Apparently, this lasted only seconds, but I had time to walk around a bit while there.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I am near sighted, everything was crystal clear and detailed.  

  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I could hear the thoughts of others.  
  
Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     More like ascending into a bright world.  
  
Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         An unusually bright light  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   The light descended and unveiled a better place.  I could see the divide as I was going.  

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     I could walk about, but my eyes had not adjusted to the brightness.  
  
What emotions did you feel during the experience?         I remember being fascinated with the fact of how much pain my body actually has after I was out of it.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt no longer in conflict with nature  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         No       

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will    

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Other Christian   I was raised in a Southern Baptist and in a Holiness environment.  At this point in my life, I began working with a local Shaman.  
  
Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I embraced learning pagan and alternative teachings.  My beliefs are very eclectic.  

What is your religion now?         Other faiths- Unitarian and other liberal faiths   I have since completed energy mastery school, and have become educated in alternative healing practices.  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     It was not what I learned in a Christian church.  What I encountered did not judge me, only offered love and acceptance.  
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I know that the judgment I was taught as a child does not exist.  
  
Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I heard a voice I could not identify   I knew there were others there, but did not see them.  I clearly heard a voice in my head telling me it was not my time.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   There is absolutely no way I can ever put into words how wonderful to other side is.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I did not at first.  After becoming a nurse, I have used my experience to bring comfort to families of the dying.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   Over the course of my life, I have had many, many experiences with death that cannot be explained.  

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real
